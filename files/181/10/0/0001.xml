Information about the procedure of the Cabinet, theorganisation of Cabinet Committees and the wotk of theCabinet office la In general confidential.

Thisinformation la, however, for the moot part fragmentary, andthere la at preeent no publlehed material available whichgives a full and up-to-date account.

This list is In no sense complete, but in theabsence of a full bibliography It may be of some use aoaguide. nquirlee received by the Cabinet office con bo dividedinto three groups according to their sourcex-(a)  ooulriee by private Individuals;(b) inquiries by specialists ete; and(ej -inquiries by Foreign and Commonwealth governmentsor Individuals sponsored by theee Governments.3.   SBffliirtfti to rfiYfttt JnHvIrtMUEnquiries are occasionally received from ordinaryaoBtbore of the public (e.g. students/.    The as are normal lymet by referring the enquirer to the etandard text-boo^s.-Oijctimes the reply can take the form of o factual answerto a etralgatforward question (eg. Are Cabinet Ulnutsskept?    Then was a secretary of the Cabinet flret appointed?)To requests for detailed information beyond the oeope of thepublished material the reply would ordinarily be in thesense that information about the procedure of the Cabinet,the organlaatlon of Cabinet Committeeo, etc lo confidentialand cannot be made available4.    p^tfjrlos by opectflliHta, etcover the peat 25 yeara various api roaches have been madeby specialists intending to write or edit treaties on theCabinet system and by authorltieo in the fields ofconstitutional law and political science    Their objectusually to obtain up-to-date information on matters bearingon the organisation of the Cabinet and Cabinet Ooamitteee;and the handling of theee enqulrlee (which have not numberedmany; depend a largely on the standing and   purpose of theenquirer,
Unless this is for some reason undesirable, thee.quire r vould narwwl ly be seen by the iiecretary of theCabinet or hie deputy and given, in general terms, Informationon the developmente or aspects in which be is interested.(This interview serves also to elicit the intentions ofthe enquirer.;     If appropriate, he would be offered a shortiaaaora&amp;don, or a note of references to published materialwhleh he any not hawe seen;   end the suggestion would bemade that he auould submit the manuscript, or at leasta printed proof, of any materiel which he intends   topublish.    This has the auvantage from the standpoint ofthe author that be la thus enabled to hawe l&amp;le-statement ecorrected, and from that of the Cabinet office that anopportunity la secured of seeking the modification of anypassages which may be objectionable.     It is usual to makeit clear to the author that be must blmeelf take fullroeponeibility and must net refer to the Cabinet office,directly or indirectly, ae the eouree of his inferuatxoa.In the few oases of this kind there has always beentoo fullest co-ope etioo.    The luain difficulty le in determininghow far information not previously published may be madeavailable.     la the past no significant information (e.g* thecomposition and function of Cabinet Qemmltteee) baa thus beendisclosed in tola way for the first time, but much detailedinformation on the moohanloal aspects of Cabinet procedure(e.g* circulation  of memoranda, preparation of the agenda,and the form of Cabinet Minutes) has been made available.A point which baa to be kept lu mind is that it le ofconsiderable advantage te the Cabinet Offlee itself tohave an authoritative textbook to which enquirers can bereferred.     (For details eee Part VIII. LAM80B, JHSBZI08, 3A2ME.)Enquiries by Foreign and Coaueaaealth Oovemaonte usuallyhave as their object the comparison of United kingdompractice with their own - the ultimate aim la usually acme over-haul of their own procedure and organisation.     jouotimes,.      v.,-, UN object ta It ahejata. a betlapj underctnnuin., o;   thecontrol maohloery of government in tola country;   thisunderlay many of the requeue for lnfossaflon  received duringFrance&quot;?0^&quot;lj3 -4oT S^freeTThe^Uoiltea^intereets of co-operation between the Alliee a good deal ofconfidential information wee made avallablo la tale way.In general the handling of requeete fraa ForeignGovernments depends on the state of ear relations with them.(In XSkkp in the handling of an enquiry from the Arge tineNaval Attache, it vae suggested that even a reference topublished material might be inappropriate i   but this is amextreme case.)    There ie, however, an obligation on theCabinet Office te be aa forthcoming mm uoealhle in meetingtheee requeste.    During the second -arid   ar very fullinformation (including detaila of War Cabinet Committo e)was given to Franco and to the United otatee, but in normalcircumstances details of the Ministerial Commltteea of theCabinet (apart from references to Coumitteee whoseexicte.ee baa already been disclosed) would not be provided.There would, however, ordinarily be no objection. If thenature of the request made tale desirable, to giving detaileof the procedure of the Cabinet and the funotlene of theCabinet Office.
Special considerations naturally apply to the handlingof requests from Oomoeneealth Governments.

Cabinet Government in this country rests on the needto reconcile two principles of our constitution, (a) Ministerialresponsibility and (b) collective responsibility. very Minister in charge of a Department la responsible toParliament for the administration of his Department - for thedischarge of statutory powers conferred on him by Parliamentand also for the exercise of his administrative discretion.Parliament exercises control over his administration -through parliamentary questions, debates in Supply, debates onthe Adjournment.     This principle of Ministerial responsibilityhas to be reconciled with the second principle, the principleof collective responsibility.All members of a Government are collectively responsiblefor its policy.    They must all defend it to the public.     Theymust all, therefore, share in tormulating it.     This means that,while a Minister can alone discharge his responsibility for theday-to-day administration of bis Department, he must be surethat be can command the support of his colleagues in newpolicies or in major modifications of existing policies.Cabinet Government is team work.     Each Minister hashis own part to play:   but he has also to help his colleaguesin playing theirs.     He cannot publicly dissociate himselffrom their policies: and he is required to vote in favour of theirproposals in Parliament.Co-ordination of PolloJ2.     The system of Cabinet Government as we know it is theinstrument by which practical effect is given to thisprinciple of the collective responsibility of Ministers whoare separately responsible to Parliament for the administrationof their own Departments.1-
Ia recent years a development of this same functionnee gained greater prominence, viz., the function of theCabinet and its Committees in facilitating co-operationbetween Departments or reconciling the conflicting interestsof Departments.Before 1914 the business of Government &quot;was relativelysimple and could be conducted by a small number of Departments,each with a clearly defined sphere.     In 1914 there were only15 major Departments.    Now there are 26.     In the last 30years the field of Government responsibility has beensubstantially extended;   this hae meant a vast increase inthe complexity of Government business and an inevitableincreass in the number of Ministers and Government Department.This, in turn, has involved some overlapping in thejurisdiction of Departments - and a great increase in thenumber of subjects which affeot more than a single Department.Fewer jobs now fall wholly within the sphere of a singleDepartment, with the result that there is greater need andgreater soope for collaboration between Departments.And there are more occasions for conflict of Interest betweendifferent Departments.Inter-departmental oollaboration is therefore essential,throughout a large part of the field of present-day Government.Most of this is carried out in day-to-day administrat ion atthe official level.     At the highest lsvsl - of oollaborationbotween Ministers - the machinery for securing effectiveco-operation is provided by the Cabinet and its Committees.The Cabinet flnfl ?lfUaVrB g&quot;taida th,? Gainst3.     In ths nineteenth century ths Cabinet normallyincluded almost all Ministers in charge of Departments.     As,however, the number of Departments increased, some of the leesImportant Departments were not always represented in the Cabinet
During the years between the wars the Postmaster-Generalwas very rarely a member of the Cabinet, and the Ministerof Transport was sometimes in the Cabinet and sometimes not.During eaoh of the two major wars of the twentieth centurythere has been a small War Cabinet of six to eight members -and other Ministers &quot;of Cabinet rank&quot; have not taken acontinuous part in the Cabinet&apos;s direction of the war.     Atthe present time the Cabinet consists of only seventeenmembers.     There are sixteen Ministers of Cabinet rank whoare not members of the Cabinet.     Thirteen of these are incharge of Departments.    (The others are the two Ministers ofState and the Paymaster General.)The tendency of future development will probably betowards Cabinets which do not Include all Ministers incharge of Departments.     This development has been assistedb^ the war-time device of small War Cabinets.     Thefundamental cause is, however, the growth in the number ofDepartments and the recognition that a body of thirtyor more Ministers is too large for the efficient despatchof business.How thsn is the principle of collective responsibilitypreserved when some Ministers of Cabinet rank who are j.ncharge of Departments and share in that responsibilityare not members of the Cabinet?   Collective responsibilityis preserved in practice in three ways -(a) The papers and minutes of the Cabinet are circulatedto all Ministers of Cabinet rank.     There are exceptions tothis rule, where matters of exceptional secrecy are involved;but, in general, all Ministers are kept in touch by thismeans with the proceedings of the Cabinet.     And any Ministerof Cabinet rank (whether or not he is a member of the Cabinet)has the right to submit suggestions to the Cabinet on anymatter, even though it falls wholly outside his jurisdiction asa Departmental Minister.
(b) A Minister who is not s number of the Cabinet isinvariably summoned to attend s Cabinet meeting at whichquestions are to be discuaeed which affect his Departmentalinteresta.     Any Minister so invited to attend Cabinet la ineffect co-opted aa a full member of tbe Cabinet for thatitem on the Agenda.(o) Ministers who are not members of the Cabinet play animportant part in the work of the Cabinet Committees, to whichmuch of the Cabinet&apos;a work la delegated.     Through theseCommittees they make their contribution towards theformulation of Government policy.     In these days ofdevelopment towards s smaller Cabinet, this la one of themore important functions of the Cabinet Committee system.aubmlBBloa of Businessh.     The Cabinet transacts its business mainly on the basisof documents.     Proposals for discussion by the Cabinet aresubmitted in the form of memoranda, which are printed orduplicated and given a general circulation among allMinisters of Cabinet rank some time ahead of the day onwhich they are to be discussed in Cabinet.     It is a rule,which can be waived only with the special permission of thePrime Minister, that memoranda shall not be set down onthe Cabinet Agenda unlaaa they have been circulated at leasttwo clear days before the date of the meeting.     Before thewar this period was five days:   during the war the rulewaa suspended:   and since the war the pressure on Cabinetbusiness has bsen so great that it has bssn impossible toInsist on an interval of more than two days.     The objectof this rule is, of course, to ensure that Ministers have anopportunity of considering proposals, and obtaining advice fromtheir Departments on them, before they are discussed inCabinet.     It la also the rule that proposal a affecting otherDepartment a shall not be submitted to the Cabinet until theyhave been thoroughly discussed with those Departments at the
at the official level and. if necessary, between Ministers.Where there is a conflict of interest between two Departments,it should never come to the Cabinet until the poaaibilitiesof securing agreement at lower levels have bean fullyexplored and exhausted.     These are obvious working rulesdevised for the purpose of shortening discussion in Cabinet.&quot;K^m llsf Minuses5.     Memoranda for discussion at a particular meeting of theCabinet are sat down on a written Agenda, which is preparedby the Cabinet Secretariat with the approval of the PrimeMinister.     At the end of each week a programme of Cabinetbusiness for the following week ie issued for the guidanceof Departments, so thst they may have advance notice of thesubjects which are likely to be raised.     The finalAgenda papers are issued lster, though still a day or twoin advance of the meeting.     These name the Ministers othsrthan members of the Cabinet who are Invited to be presentfor particular items, and specify the times at which theyare to attend.Records of the Cabinet&apos;s meetings are kept by ths CabinetSecretariat.     These are not verbatim records of all that issaid in the discussion.     They record primarily theconclusions reached and so much of the salient points in thediscussion as is necessary for a full understanding of theCabinet&apos;e conclusions.     In particular, they specify theparticular Department or Departments by which action ia tobe taken to give effect to the Cabinet&apos;a conclusions.     TheseMinutes are Invariably circulated at 8 a.m. on the day followingthat on which the meeting is held.It is the duty of the Cabinet Secretariat to verify thataction has been taken by the Departments concerned to giveeffect to the Cabinet&apos;s conclusions.
AttMflinflft ftr Cabinet!_thg Cabinet 9fore*Ml*,t6.     This system of Cabinet documentation is a comparativelyrecent growth.     It began with the formation of a War Cabinetin 1916, when Mr. Lloyd George imported into Cabinetbusiness the secretarial machinery whloh had been built up bySir Maurice Hankey for serving the Committee of ImperialDefence.     Before 1916 no records had been kept of Cabinetmeetings.     Ho one was present at such meetings exeept themembers of the Cabinet themselves;   and the Departments whichhad to take action on the Cabinet&apos;s conclusions received theirinstructions from their Minister on his return from the Cabinet.In the last thirty years the secretarial arrangementsfor handling Cabinet business have been greatly developed andextended;   and the Cabinet Secretariat baa become awell-established part of the central machinery of Government.But, although the documentation has been put on a business-likebasis, Cabinet meetings are etill essentially meetings ofMinisters only.     The Secretary of the Cabinet and one ortwo of his senior assistants are present to make their recordof the proceedings;   but the rule is that, apart from them,no one attends who is not either a member of the Cabinetor a Minister invited for the discussion of a particular item.This gives to the proceedings an atmosphere of specialintimacy and a sense of corporate spirit which are a greathelp to the speedy conduct of business.Cabinet OninmitfM7.     The Cabinet&apos;s rules of procedure apply also to theCommittees of the Cabinet, which handle their documents andtransact their business in much the same way.     The onlydifference of procedure which need be mentioned relatesto the attendance of officials.     Here the practice variesfrom one Committee to another.     At Cabinet it is a matterof course that officials do not attend.     At CabinetCommittees, the attendance of officials depends largely on the-6-
status of too Committee and the nature of the subjects tobe discussed - there is no inflexible rule against their attendance.In practice, officials rarely attend meetings of the seniorCommittees - and, when they do, they come as advisers totheir Minister and do not themselves take part in thediscussions.     There are some Committees where officialsas well as Ministers attend and speak - and some whichare composed of senior officials, sometimes with a JuniorMinister in the Chair.     But, in general, the practicereflects the principle that the formulation of polioy isthe personal responsibility of Ministers.Fttflctlpaa of CflblAet Committees6.     Cabinet Committees fulfil two functionss-(a) The mass of business engaging the collectiveresponsibility of the Government is too great to behandled by a single body.     The Cabinet Committees relievethe burden falling on the Cabinet in two ways.    First, theydispose finally of a great number of problems of minorimportance:   and here they act in the Cabinet&apos;s name, byvirtue of powers delegated to them by the Cabinet. Secondly,on problems which are of such importance that they must inany event corns to the Cabinet, a Committee can shortendiscussion in Cabinet by preliminary discussion which focussesthe issues and narrows down the points outstanding forthe Cabinet*s decision.     This ofton enables the Chairman of aCommittee to put to the Cabinet in a single memorandumissues which would otherwise come before them in separatepapers submitted by several Ministers.(b) The system of Cabinet Committees enables Ministersof Cabinet rank who are not members of the Cabinet to taketheir share in the formulation of Government polioy.     Bytheir membership of these Committees, whey can assist Indisposing of business devolved by the Cabinet to the Committees,and can also join in the preliminary stages of formulatingpolicy proposals for submission to the Cabinet.
This system not only relieves the pressure on theCabinet itself, but also lightens the oolleetive work ofMinisters generally.     For none of the Cabinet Committees isas large as the the Cabinet Itself.     Some of the moreimportant Committees may consist of ten Ministers, ascompared with the 17 members of the Cabinet.     OtherCommittees are substantially smaller, some consisting of only threeor four Ministers.Standing Committees and Ad Ugtj Qm-yrflttngB9.     Cabinet Committees are of two kinds - Standing Committeesand ad hoe Committees.     The ad hog Committees are set upby the Cabinet or by the Prime Minister to handle questionsof transient importance - often to work out the detailsof a policy which the Cabinet has approved in principle, orto find means of surmounting difficulties which have beenraised in a Cabinet discussion but need not detain theCabinet as a whole.     On this account they are usuallysmaller than the Standing Committees of the Cabinet.     Theynormally meet two or three times and than submit a reportto the Cabinet.    They may, however, remain in being forseveral months if they have been appointed to handleproblems which, though temporary, may given rise todifficulties over a period.The Standing Committees of the Cabinet are arrangedon a more schematic basis.     They are designed to provide aregular means of handling, below the Cabinet level, problemsengaging the collective responsibility of Ministers whicharise regularly throughout the year,     Wherever there is sreasonable bulk of homogeneous questions which can withadvantage be discussed below the level of the Cabinet itself,it is the practice to establish a Standing Committee of theCabinet to deal with them.     The growth of the CabinetCommittee system is, however, very largely an enpirioalgrowth - Committees are established when experience hasshown the need for them, and abolished when they are no longer
required.     There ie no conscious determination to impose1 logical system which would provide an appropriateCommittee for every problem which might conceivably arise.Nor is there any rule which requires that business shall alwayspass through a Committee before it comes to the Cabinet.Many proposals are in fact submitted to the Cabinet direct -especially if they are of such importance that they mustbe considered by the Cabinet itself but not of suchcomplexity that they must first be &quot;pre-digested&quot; by aCommittee.     The system of Cabinet Committees ieconstantly being adapted to changing circumstances - by theseverely pragmatical test of &quot;what works best&quot; - and itmakes no pretensions to schematic perfection.
-1-The functions of the Cabinet Office include ths askingof arrangements for meetings of the Cabinet and CabinetCommittees, the preparation of agenda, the circulation ofmemoranda, the recording in minutes of the conclusions reachedat meetings and the drafting of reports.   In carrying out thesefunctions the Secretariat act on the instructions of ths PrimsMinister and the Chairmen of Cabinet Committees.The following outline notes relate particularly tothe business of ths Cabinet, but they apply also in generalto Cabinet Committees.2.     Submission of business,    The Secretary of the Cabinet isinformed by Departments at as early a stage as possible ofmatters which their Ministers desire to raise in Cabinet.The business which comes before the Cabinet normally relatesto (a) matters of general policy which require a collectivedecision of Ministers, or (b) conflicts of view betweenDepartments, which cannot be resolved between the Ministersconcerned in correspondence or discussion.   Where a Ministerfinds it necessary to raise a matter orally (i.e. without theprior circulation of a memorandum on the subject) he firstseeks the approval of the Prime Minister.3*     Meetings    So far as possible the Cabinet meets atregular intervals.   Ths procedure at meetings is governed bylong-stending traditions.   The Secretary of the Cabinetattends (unless otherwise instructed by ths Prims Minister)for the purpose of making a record of the conclusions.U.     Agenda    The Secretary of the Cabinet takes the PrimeMinister&apos;s instructions on the subjects to be discussed at aparticular meeting, and circulates, as long as possible inadvance, an agenda paper listing the items of business, withreferences to relevant memoranda and to any previousdiscussions, and particulars of the date, time and place of
Editing.   Thia agenda paper shows the names of any Ministersother than members of the Cabinet whom the Prime Ministerdesires to have present.5*     Memoranda    Matters are normally- discussed by the Cabineton the basis of memoranda previously prepared by the Ministersconcerned.   These papers, which are designed to set oatconcisely the points at issue and the Ministers&apos; views andrecommendations, are circulated by the Cabinet Office tomembers of the Cabinet and other Ministers interested as longas possible in advance of the meeting at which they are to beconsidered.   To facilitate handling and reference each paperis given a serial number.6*     Minutes,    Ho Verbatim record of the proceedings ismade.   The Secretary of the Cabinet prepares a short note ofthe conclusions reached together with a brief summary ofthe discussion leading up to them.   These minutes are reproducedin the Cabinet Office and circulated to Ministers normallyon the morning following the day of the meeting;   and aftera short interval they are printed and again circulated.7*     laoTfT&quot;*1A0 of Decisions    The Ministers concerned areresponsible for ensuring that the necessary action is takenby their Departments to implement decisions on matters withintheir sphere of responsibility.
Much of the vavk of the Cabinet is delegated to Comuitteeeof the Cabinet consisting of the Ministers particularlyconcerned with certain specific fields of policy.     TheseCommittees may be either standing Committees or Committeesspecially constituted to deal with a particular problemor set of problems.     To secure maximum flexibility, thenumber, scope and membership of Cabinet Committees may bevaried from time to time, and the Cabinet Committeestructure is kept under cloee review by the Prime Minister.The Committee themselves may be served by sub-committeesof Ministers or by committees of officials.The principle of collective responisbility depends,in practice, upon the existence of opportunities forfree and frank discussion between Ministers.     For thisreason the proceedings and documents of the Cabinet andit8 Committees are secret;   and the terms of reference andcomposition of Cabinet Committees are in general notdie closed.The following are the main standing Committees(a) Defence Committee.     This Committee, under thechairmanship of the Prime Minister, is responsibleto the Cabinet for the review of current strategyand for co-ordinating Departmental action inpreparation for war.     Its composition is flexible;the Chiefs of staff attend its meetings.Problems of inter-service co-ordination, asdistinct from defence policy as a whole, arethe responsibility of the minister of Defence.For a description of the defence organisationand the principal committees through which theMinister of Defence works, see ths White Paper onthe Central Organisation of Defence (Cmd. 6923).1-
(b) Scoaoiaie &quot;ftnMsitft-     Tbe Economic Folio? Committeeunder the chairmanship or the Prime Minister, handlesthe major issues or economic policy at home andoverseas.     Measures to increase production arekept under review by a committee under thechairmanship or tbe Chancellor or the Exchequer,who has, in the functions which he formerlyexercised as Minister for Economic Aft airs, aposition in relation to the Ministers in chargeof Departments in the field of trade and industry,somewhat analogous to that of the Minister or Defencein relation to the Service Ministers.,(e) Lord Presidsnt&apos;s Committee.   Under tho generaldirection of the Cabinet, this Committee, underthe chairmanship of the Lord President of theCouncil, deals with s wlds variety of   domesticquestions outside the economic field.     Itsmembership includes those Ministers primarilyconcerned with home affairs, but other Ministersattend when necessary,(d) Legislation &quot;EHf&quot;!The primary task of thisCommittee, of which the Lord President or theCouncil is Chairman, is to keep the Government * blegislative program e under review and to examinedraft Bills before introduction into Parliament.
The Cabinet Office originates frost the formation, byMr. Lloyd George In December, 1916, of e war Cabinet with eSecretariat which absorbed the personnel of the Secretariatof the former Committee of Imperial Defence and founded itstechnique on practice established by that Secretariat.   InNovember, 1919. *hen the War Cabinet wee replaced by aCabinet of normal else and the Committee of Imperial Defencewee revived, the Secretariat was retained,, the Secretary ofthe War Cabinet becoming Secretary of both the Cabinet andthe Committee of Imperial Defence.   This arrangement continueduntil the outbreak of the second World war when e war Cabinetwee formed end the Committee of Imperial Defence was disbanded,the Cabinet Office becoming the war Cabinet Office.     InMay, I9U5, when the War Cabinet came to an end. the title&quot;Cabinet Office&quot; wee resumed.   The Committee of ImperialDefence has not so far been re-established, and its functionsere being discharged by the war-time Defence Committee, whichle served by the Cabinet Office.2.    The present function of the Off lee may be broadlydescribed as the provision of secretarial services for theCabinet and lte Committees.   While the number of the latter hasvaried from time to time and la constantly adjusted to mootcurrent needs, there le now a well established syatsm ofCommittees, dealing with a wide range of subjects,divisible into defence, economic affairs, otherinternal affairs and external affairs.    The secretarialservices provided consist ofs-(1)   The arrangement of meetings;(11)   The circulation of agenda, memoranda and otherdocuments;-1-
(ill)   TIM drafting and circulation of minutes andconclusions)(It)   Follow-up notion to make sure that conclusionsare carried out;(v)   The drafting of reports; and(ri)   Ths custody and indexing of records.3.    The staff of the Office, apart from clerical and similarsubordinate staff, consists of a relatively small number ofCivil Servants who ere for the moot part seconded from otherDepartments, together with a number of officers similarlyseconded from the three Fighting Services.   The norms!organisation of the Office follows the broad divisions ofsubjects referred to in the preceding paragraph.   Under theSecretary of the Cabinet, who le responsible for the Officeas a whole, there are those senior officers superintending thethree main blocks of work - a senior military officer who iein charge of the Secretariat of the Military commit tees, andtwo senior Civil Servants (normally Under Secretaries) ofwhom one superintends ths secretaries of Committeee dealingwith non-economic internal affairs, and the other le in chargeof the secretaries of Committees dealing with economic aadexternal affairs.h*    The secretarial services for the cabinet itself arenormally carried out exclusively by the senior officersreferred to in the preceding paragraph, under the direction ofthe Prime Minister.   In particular, the Secretary ie responsibleto the Prime Minister fori-(1)   The orderly arrangement of Cabinet business, so as toensure not only that urgent matters are given duepriority, hut also that complicated issues are notbrought to Cabinet without adequate preparation;(11)   The invitation to Cabinet meetings, where necessary,of Ministers not membera of the Cabinet;
(ill)   The amlatsanncc ef arrangements for the eecurlty ofCabinet documents aad the secrecy of Cabinetproceedings;   aad(ir)   The continuous oversight of the working of theCabinet Cowed.ttee system, including advice tothe Prime Minister on the establishment andabolition of each committees and changes intheir membership and tanas of reference.%    Each committee secretary la responsible In the firetplace to the Chairman of his Committee for the conduct ofthe Coaralttee*b business aad many mattera are settled by himwithout reference to higher authority Id the Cabinet Office.The nature of Cabinet Office work would prevent the Officebeing organised on a rigidly hierarchical basis and eachsecretary must have a large measure of independence in hisown field.   It le,however, the object of the organisation tomaintain throughout the Office a uniform standard and awsinian technique, and to prevent the different committeesecretaries from Insulating thsma elves from each other.This ie accomplished by general instructions on the conductof committee business, the form of records and reports, etc.,sad a wide distribution within the Offioe of the documenteof each committee, so that supervising officers may callattention to any irregularities In procedure or lack efco-ordination between different committeee and at the sametime eeasslttee secretaries generally may bs kept informedof what other committees are doing.     Is some casea,special additional arrangements are necessary.   Thus, if acivil committee is handling s subject allied to that of amilitary committee, the secretary of ths latter any beae joint secretary to the formes? and vice
8.    It la the tradition of the Office that aecretariea ofOlbmttteoo shall he strictly impartial between Departments andspeoialiata only in their secretarial technique and not in thetrsubject matter of their Committees.    In tending advice to thedMirmon of Conmltteee Cabinet Office secretaries normallyconfine themselves to supplying further information, clarifyingthe issues Involved and making eaggeetlons for the handling ofthe discussion or future procedure.   Where the subject of aCommittee la of close concern to a particular Department, fromwhoa much specialised information and considerable detailedaction will he required, it is a common practice to appoint aJoint secretary from that Department, with the particularresponsibility of seeing that the committee receives aU theinformation it needs from the Department and that Its decisionsare ooomletely understood and implemented by the Department.
The Prime Minister has no statutory powers.    Hispowers derive primarily from the faet that he is normallythe leader of the political party with a majority in theHouse of Commons, and that as such he has been asked bythe i.ing to be Head of the Government.    The extent to whichthe powers latsnt in this position are made reel dependson two thingst-(a) The personal influence of the Prime Minister over theMinisters who make up the Government.    The PrimeMinister, if he wishes, ssleots his own ministers.He can do so without consultation, althoughnormally he would consult his senior colleagues.Squally he has the power to recommend theirrepisemesnt or diamleaal, and he can, by his ownresignation, bring about the resignation of thewhole Government,(bj The Prime Minister&apos;e chairmanship of the Cabinet andsome of its most important Uoii.ilttees, particularlythe Defence Cotalttee.The Prime Minister is also normally the First Lord ofthe Treasury.    This Department has substantial statutory andother powers, but the day-to-day work is under the chargeof the Chancellor of the Sxobeqoer and the Prime Ministeris not directly concerned.    Nevertheless, the PrimeMinister does derive one very important power   from hisposition aa First Lord, namely his ultimate power of controlof the Civil service.   The Prime Minister&apos;s authority isrequired for the major appointments in the Civil service, andthis is an Important factor in maintaining the unity ofthe -ervice as a whole.The Prime Minister does not now normally take charge ofany other Department, although in the past Prime Ministershere combined with their Office the Offices of Chancellor of the
Sxchequer, Foreign secretary and others.    But in the spheresof Foreign Affairs and of defence, the Prime Minister has asomewhat special position.    Matters of political importanceare of more frequent occurrence in the sphere of work of theForeign secretary then perhaps of ear other DepartmentalMinister.   All these matters cannot be brought to Cabinet,aad for this reason tbe Prime Minister mast keep closely intouch with foreign affairs.    Normally when the Foreign Secretaryis away, his duties are undertaken by the Prime Minister.   Inths sphere of Defence, the Prime Minister retains the supremeresponsibility and is chairman of the Defence Committee.    Thissupreme responsibility is not affected by the appointment ofa Minister of Defence,wince the Prime Minister has no statutory powers and noDepartment, he has no need for a large staff;   to a considerableextent he draws his advice and assistance from all Departments,he has on the one hand ia the transaction of official businessths advice of the secretary of the Treasury, and on the otherin the conduct of Cabinet affairs that of the Secretary to theCabinet.    There is, however, a wide range of business requiringexperienced handling sad knowledge of precedents and traditionwhich lias within the immediate orbit neither of the Treasury,nor of the Cabinet Office or any Department;   on theae mattershe is advised by his Private beoretartea*    These questionsInclude the transaction of business with the Crown, changes ofGovernment sad appointments of Ministers, personal relations withother Ministers, etc., honours, and certain scholastic andecclesiastical appointments, aad appointments to manyInstitutions of a national character, such as the BritishMuseum, the National Gallery, and so forth.Tea Prime Minister has at present two senior and threejunior Private ceoretarlea, who are drawn from the permanentCivil oervice.    They are net responsible for advising onpolicy or for executing the Prime Minister^ decisions on
policy.    Their meet important duty la te eee that whenmatters are before him he receives advioe from the appropriateauthority and that hie advice and decisions are properlyand clearly conveyed to that authority.    In the eaee ofpurely Government business the appropriate Department anstbe informed or in matters outside the Government machinethe appropriate authority.    The advice which comas to tbePrime Minister from Departments should always have theauthority of the departmental Minister.acme Prime Ministers have Included in their personalstaffs, in addition to their private -ooretariee, one or morePersonal ^si-tents or advisers ohosen for their expertKnowledge in a particular field in whloh they can given specialhelp to tbe Prime Minister.Aa has been stated, the Prime Minister is not concernedwith the day-to-day activities of the -r asury.    Generalfinancial policy, tbe control of Government expenditure andthe supervision of the civil wsrviee are Treasury functionsfor which the Chancellor of the Exchequer is the responsibleMinister, while each Minister le responsible for tbeinternal organisation of his own Deportment.    There is,however, an exception to this, in the rule that forappointmenta to the highest permanent posts in Departmentsthe consent of the Prime Minister is required.    In thismatter the Prime Minister is advised by the secretary of theTreasury.    This arrangement eneuree that the informationavailable in the Treasury regarding the ^xvil service leput at the disposal of Ministers In making these appointments,so that tbe highest administrative posts may be filled bythe best men from the whole Civil service and nor merely bypromotion within each Department.    Apart from this particular
arrangement, tne Secretary to the Treasury is in aposition to advise the Prime Minister on questions concerningthe allocation of functions between Departments, the creationof new Departments, and other questions of interdepartmentalmachinery.The Secretary of the Cabinet is a permanent CivilServant and head of the Cabinet Office.   This Offioe hasno statutory powers or executive responsibilities;   itexists merely to assist Ministers in the exercise of theiroolleetive responsibility through the Cabinet and iteCommittees, by handling the business and keeping the recordsof these bodies,     seeing that Ministers who are departmentallyconcerned with questions under discussion are invited totheir meetings, and that all Ministers are kept informedof their decisions.     The  Cabinet Offlee thus serves allMinisters and is strictly impartial bstween Departments.     TheSecretary of the Cabinet, however, has a special responsibilitytowards the Prime Minister for the conduct of Cabinet business,and also for advising him on questions arising out of theworking of the Cabinet Committee system.     For example, hemay draw the Prime Minister&apos;s attention to the need for anew Committee or the opportunity for abolishing anexisting one, or make other suggestions   designed toensure that changes in the charastor of Government businessare reflected in the Committee organisation.

Printed for the War Cabinet.  April 1943.SECRET. Copy No.M.G. (43) 2.   (Second Revise).April 16, 1943.WAR CABINET.Committee on Machinery of Government.STANDING COMMITTEES OF THE CABINET.Note by the Chairman.AT their last meeting (M.G. (43) 2nd Meeting, Minute 1) the Committeeasked that the Memorandum on a permanent Cabinet Committee organisationshould be further revised preparatory to discussion with the Foreign Secretaryand other Ministers.A fresh revise has been prepared accordingly and is appended.(Initialled)        J. A.Privy Council Office,April 16, 1943.1. The Machinery of Government CJommittee have inclined generally to theview that no attempt should be made to grroup Departmental Ministers and theirfunctions under a small number of Supervising Ministers who would enjoy asuperior and dominating status and wou Id have a declared and formal responsi-bility for the supervision and control o T Departmental Ministers within theirsphere. The Committee have felt, however, that there may well be advantagein perpetuating in peace-time the kind -of arrangement embodied at present inthe Lord Presidents Committee and the *Oivil Defence Committee; that is to say,that it may be desirable to maintain ones or more Standing Cabinet Committeeswith a small permanent membership woorking in defined spheres under and onbehalf of the Cabinet. Such Committees^ would operate to reduce the volume ofwork falling directly on the Cabinet by proroviding a focus for the formulation ofpolicy by Ministers short of the Cahihefr itself. Thus they might (a) carry outpreliminary work on subjects which wil 11 ultimately require Cabinet decisions,in order to clear the ground and to fow-ous the issues requiring final decision;(b) reach decisions on behalf of the Cabninet on questions which, while they gobeyond the spheres in which decisions^ can be taken by a single Minister,need not, by reason of their importance or-ar political difficulty, engage the attentionof the whole Cabinet: and (c) act (perhaeips at times, u may be agreed, throughthe Chairman alone) as an informal tribunal available to mediate in anyDepartmental differences.It is perhaps one of the advantag*T&quot; es of this system of standing CabinetCommittees that no need arises to coveser the whole field, of Government by anetwork of such Committees : the system a is flexible andean be restricted to thosespheres of Government in which, in th**e conditions at any time prevailing, itwould perform a useful function.[26522] b
2. This Memorandum suggests the possible outlines of a Cabinet Committeemachine of this kind. In examining these suggestions three general eonsidera-tions should be borne in mind -(a) Any such sketch as this must be extremely tentative in character.  Apartfrom possible permanent changes in the nature and distribution ofGovernment functions which cannot now be forecast, the structure ofthe Government machine at the Cabinet and Cabinet Committee levelwill require readjustment from time to time, both in form andpractical working; modifications will be needed, not only to enablethe machine to deal more effectively with the particular problems whichat any particular time are in the forefront of affairs, but also to meetthe varying methods, not only of different Prime Ministers, but oftheir principal colleagues.(b) In attempting to look forward from war conditions to peace, accountmust be taken of the fact that in peace-time the Cabinet (howeverconstituted) will be able and will wish to devote much more time todirecting the peaceful activities of Government than is possible ordesirable in war. It may be assumed, therefore, that many of thetypes of problem now settled by the Lord President&apos;s Committee willin peace-time have to be discussed and decided by the Cabinet itself.(c) In war-time the Prime Minister must be occupied first and foremostwith the conduct of the war. But in peace the Prime Minister willagain be able to keep a closer contact with all the principal activitiesof Government and will no doubt wish to do so. He will need towatch the development of major policies from the earliest stages; and,so far as the working out of important Government proposals isentrusted to Cabinet Committees, he may wish at times to maintainsuch contact with their work as can only be obtained by actuallyattending their meetings. It is, of course, possible that the PrimeMinister might himself be Chairman of one or more of the StandingCommittees; or it may be useful to adopt the device used before thewar in the case of the Committee of Imperial Defence, by which thePrime Minister was Chairman and could thus without difficulty takepart in meetings at any time he chose, but another Minister normallvpresided in the capacity of Deputy Chairman.3. For the purpose of the following outline two assumptions have beenmade in order to provide a working basis (but not as matters upon which theCommittee has reached conclusions).  The assumptions are :  (a) That there will be a return after the war to a Cabinet constructed broadlvon pre-war lines, i.e., a Cabinet composed of the Ministers in chargeof all of the principal Departments of State, though in order to avoida Cabinet of unwieldy size it might be decided to exclude certainMinisters responsible for the administration of services unlikelv tobe the subject of frequent political controversy. ,(b) that the principal Ministerial Offices and the division of functionsbetween them will remain as at present, subject to the disappearanceof the Ministries of Production, Information and F.conomic Warfareand the reabsorption of the Ministries of Supply and Aircraft Pro-duction by the War Office, the Air Ministry and the Board of Trade(the latter taking over commodity and trade controls).4. The following notes indicate the main spheres in which a system ofStanding Cabinet Committees might be useful. They do not purport to coverthe whole field of administration, since only actual experience could show theuseful limits of the system. It is, however, assumed that after the war theproblems of defence, of international policy and trade, of national economicdevelopment and of social welfare will loom large in the affairs of Government.These problems might be handled, subject to the general direction of the Cabinet,by a system of Standing Committees on the following lines. The subjects to becovered by each of these Committees, and the possible membership of each, areindicated in tabular form in the Appendix.(i) Defence.Defence is an obvious sphere in which some Standing Committee organisa-tion is likely to be necessary.  The structure of a Defence Committee depends on
the questions (a) whether it is decided to reconstitute a Committee of ImperialDefence on pre-war lines, and (b) whether it is decided to have a Minister forDefence (or a Minister for Co-ordination of Defence) in addition to the threeService Ministers. Assuming that it will be necessary to have a body, withmembership on the lines of the Committee of Imperial Defence, to bring togetherall the various inter-departmental interests affected by Defence questions, it maywell be found desirable, if no Minister of Defence is appointed, to have, inaddition to the larger body, a small Defence Committee to deal with the narrowerbut essential problem of co-ordinating the defence policy of the three FightingServices.(ii) Foreign Policy, Overseas Economic Relations and National Development.Without prejudicing the extent to which Government control and directionof the economic life of the country may be thought desirable, it seems clear thata large part of the activity of Government after the war will relate to thedevelopment of the country&apos;s economic life. This will require the closest co-ordination between our external economic policy and questions of nationaldevelopment and internal economic planning. For example, the balance betweenagriculture and other industries is closely linked with import and export policyin relation both to the Dominions and to foreign countries. But economicquestions will also be of vital importance in foreign relations generally, andparticularly in the early years of transition after the war our foreign policy,apart from the vital issues of security, is likely to be concerned very largely witheconomic problems connected with the rehabilitation of Europe and the processnecessary to get international trade started again on sound lines.These three spheres of Government activity, viz., foreign policy, overseaseconomic relations, and internal national development, are fields in whichdirection and co-ordination by Standing Committees of the Cabinet may well bedesirable. But the interrelation indicated above of policies in these spheres issuch that a number of alternative arrangements of committees is possible; thebalance of advantage between these alternatives may well appear more clearly inthe light of future developments not now to be foreseen.Possible alternatives in this field: i(a) One possibility is to set up three committees, one to cover domestic nationaldevelopment and internal economic planning, one to deal with over-seas economic relations and one to deal with questions of foreignpolicy not primarily of an economic character. In favour of such asystem it may be urged on the one hand that there will be many mattersof internal economic development which will call for examinationpurely as domestic problems unconnected with any questions of over-seas economic relations; and on the other hand that in post-warconditions there are likely to arise a number of problems in the sphereof foreign affairs which are not obviously related to economics, suchas purely political treaties, the arrangements for ensuring inter-national security and international disputes of a political character.If, in view of these considerations and of the danger of overloadingany one committee Avith too wide a range of subjects, it was decided toset up three separate committees to cover this field, it would be desir-able to secure co-ordination between them, not only by interlockingmembership, but by arranging that the two committees concerned witheconomic problems should meet jointly for the examination ofquestions of concern to both: and similarly that the Committee onExternal Economic Relations should meet jointly with the ForeignPolicy Committee to consider joint problems.(b) It has been suggested alternatively that overseas economic and politicalrelations will be so closely bound up together after the war, wheninternational problems may be expected to be increasingly economicin character, or at any rate to include vital economic aspects, that anyStanding Cabinet Committee machinery in this field should consistof one Committee wide enough in membership and terms of referenceto cover external relations as a whole, both political and economic.If such a Committee were established a second committee might be setup to cover internal economic planning and national development,leaving the co-ordination of external and internal economic policv as afunction of the Cabinet itself, as the Cabinet must formulate thegeneral economic plan to which all policies should conform.[26522] b 2
(c) There is, however, a possible third alternative. It may be found thatthe main economic problems calling for solution in peace conditionswill be those problems which concern both domestic economic affairsand overseas relations, and that owing to the preponderance of thiskind of question it is desirable to have a single committee dealingwith both external and internal economic problems. Such anarrangement would not of course preclude the constitution ofalternative panels of the committee composed of appropriate Ministerswho would meet in place of the full committee when matterseither of purely domestic or of purely external interest were beingconsidered; the meetings of the full committee could then be reservedfor those occasions where interlocking problems affecting both fieldswere to be examined.If this arrangement of one Economic Relations and NationalDevelopment Committee were to be adopted, it might still be desirableto establish a separate committee to deal with foreign or overseasproblems not primarily of an economic character. There might be aconsiderable number of non-economic questions which the ForeignSecretary would wish to discuss with his colleagues but would notdesire to bring before the Cabinet. Such a committee would beconcerned, for instance, with the arrangements for internationalco-operation in the political sphere and for the maintenance of worldpeace, which will give rise to questions of considerable complexity.It would be for consideration whether such a Foreign PolicyCommittee should also be concerned with relations within the BritishCommonwealth (other than economic relations).Membership of Economic and Foreign Committees.The most appropriate membership of the various committees suggestedabove would of course vary with each of the alternatives. No attempt cansuitably be made at this stage to lay down definite lists of members, since thecomposition of these committees is essentially one for determination by the PrimeMinister of the day in the light of current conditions and personalities. Purelyprovisional lists are. however, suggested in the Appendix. These provisional listsare drawn up on the basis of the present functions of the offices concerned.Any committee concerned with foreign policy wrould presumablv include inaddition one or two senior Ministers chosen by reason of their personal standingand experience, irrespective of the offices which they hold. If it so happenedthat the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of tbe Board of Tradewere to be members of the Foreign Policy Committee (and even if the committeewere confined to questions not primarily economic in character, both theseMinisters would have some claim to membership by reason of their departmentalduties) they would, together with the Foreign Secretary, form a stron^ linkbetween this committee and the committee dealing with economic problems. Ifthe committee were concerned only with political relations with forecn countriesit would be necessary for the Secretaries of State for the Colonies and India toattend frequently at meetings for consultation and the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs should perhaps be a permanent member. If, on the other handthe scope of the committee were extended to include all external relations allthree Ministers should be permanent members of the committee.(iii) Social Services.The Government have accepted in principle the majority of the reeommenda-tions in the Beveridge Report for a comprehensive and unified scheme of socialinsurance; but they have reserved the question whether the administration ofthis unified scheme should be entrusted to a single Ministrv of Social SecurityEven if such a Ministry were established, it would not include within its scopethe whole of the social services. Health, housing and education, to quote onlvthree examples, would still be the concern of separate Departments and in thisand other aspects of social legislation, there is also separate administration forScotland.There is, therefore, scope for a standing Cabinet Committee to co-ordinatepolicy in the sphere of the social services.(iv) Legislation.A standing Committee will be required to undertake the functions assignedin peace time to the Home Affairs Committee and now discharged bv&quot; theLegislation Committee.
This Committee examines the terms of proposed legislation to ensure that itis in line with approved policy. It also ensures (a) that Ministers who maybe affected by the terms of legislation (but are not so directly concerned as to havebeen consulted in the formulation of the policy) have an opportunity of com-menting on that legislation, and (b) that important matters of principle are notsettled accidentally in the course of framing particular items of legislation. Itwould probably prove convenient to keep the permanent membership small innumber, though the meetings would be freely attended by other Ministers whomight be concerned in the matters under discussion.5. It has hitherto been the general practice of the Government to refuseto disclose in public the functions or the composition of Cabinet Committees.This practice rests, of course, upon the theory that decisions at the Cabinet levelare those of the Government as a whole and that the internal arrangements whichmay be made by Ministers for discussion among themselves on questions ofpolicy are essentially a domestic matter and are no concern of Parliament or thepublic. It is vitally necessary to maintain free and frank discussion betweenMinisters, and this is hampered if the processes by which it is carried on arelaid bare. Decisions of the Government normally fall to be announced anddefended by the Minister concerned as his own decision, and it is only very rarelydesirable (in order to emphasise the importance of some particular decision) tostate that a decision has been taken by His Majesty&apos;8 Government or the Cabinet.Any general practice of announcing decisions of the Cabinet or of CabinetCommittees as such would lead to embarrassment by causing some decisions ofGovernment to be regarded as less authoritative than others and by invitingcriticism of the processes of discussion by which decisions were reached.It is perhaps more important to maintain the anonymity of membership ofCabinet Committees than it is to refrain from disclosing their existence andgeneral functions, since there is a danger, if the composition of a committee isknown, that individual members may come to be regarded in Parliament and inthe view of the public as specially responsible for the policy adopted in the spherecovered by the conunittee&apos;s activities: this would weaken the authority of thedepartmental Minister principally concerned and the collective responsibility ofthe Government as a whole.There were occasional exceptions to the practice of non-disclosure in peace,mainly in the case of long-established Standing Committees, such as theCommittee of Imperial Defence. Since the outbreak of war, however, ashappened in the last war, some relaxation has been found desirable as regards thelayout of the War Cabinet Committee system in order that Parliament may beinformed of the main structure of the organisation by means of which the Govern-ment handles war-time business. But the general position has been maintainedand requests for information about War Cabinet Committees have often beenrefused; thus, although it was generally known that a Committee of the Cabinetwas examining the Beveridge proposals on Social Insurance, the Government hasrefused to state which Ministers were members of the Committee concerned.The importance of the general doctrine of non-disclosure in these mattershas recently been reaffirmed by the Prime Minister and it will no doubt still befound desirable in peace time to maintain the practice to the greatest possibleextent. If, however, a series of Standing Committees of the Cabinet is adopted aspart of the machinery of peace-time Government, Parliament and the public maylegitimately expect to be told the general nature of the arrangements and theprecedent of the Committee of Imperial Defence in peace time and those createdduring the present war suggest that there would be little objection to a statementwhich would showr the general functions of each Standing Committee; a dis-tinction can perhaps be drawn in this respect between Standing Committees andpurely ad hoc Committees. It will be important, however, that decisions shouldnot be announced as Committee decisions and any general disclosure of member-ship would be undesirable both for the reasons indicated above and because fromtime to time the composition of the Committees would vary; it would be less easvto maintain flexibility to meet changing conditions if membership were stabilisedby formal public announcements. Some latitude in this respect, may,, however,be necessary in disclosing the identity of the Chairman of the StandingCommittees, particularly where these are presided over by Ministers withoutdepartmental duties. This is a matter which the Prime Minister will need todecide in his discretion as occasion arises.

CONFIDENTIAL.[First Revise.]Copy No.  66THE CENTRAL EXECUTIVE GOVERNMENTOF GREAT BRITAIN.The War Cabinet.1. The War Cabinet is the supreme organ of the CentralExecutive Government. Six Ministers who are n*t membersof the War Cabinet regularly attend its meetings. Three otherMinisters who, in view of their responsibilities, require to bekept closely informed of developments in the war situation,attend weekly meetings as a regular arrangement. For the rest.Ministers who are not members of the War Cabinet are invited toattend meetings of the War Cabinet when matters which concernthem are to be considered.2. Military Advisers. Under their warrant of appointmentthe Chiefs of the Staffs of the three Fighting Services have, inaddition to their responsibilities as advisers on Sea, Land andAir policy respectively to their own Board or &quot;Council, anindividual and a collective responsibility for advising on defencepolicy as a whole. The Chiefs of the Staffs attend the weeklyfull meetings of the War Cabinet and on other occasions whenmilitary questions are to be considered.Ministers of Cabinet Rank.3. Whilst the War Cabinet is the supreme organ of theCentral Execuuve Government, day-to-day business is carriedon by the Ministers of Cabinet rank (whether Ministers incharge of Departments or Ministers &quot;without Portfolio &quot;), eachof whom has direct access to the War Cabinet.4. Two examples may be cited of occasions on which amatter might be brought before the War Cabinet or a WarNote._These Notes are not intended to be complete inthemselves, but to provide the necessary &quot; background &quot; for aproper understanding of the Chart of the Central ExecutiveGovernment.[27662]
Cabinet Committee at the instance. of the Minister primarilyconcerned: (a) A question might arise for decision in his Departmentwhich, on account of its intrinsic importance, heconsidered should not be settled until his Ministerialcolleagues had been consulted. In such a case hewould normally arrange for the matter to be broughtbefore the War Cabinet or the appropriate MinisterialCommittee. (It might, of course, sometimes happenthat a matter would be disposed of by less formalmethods, e.g., by personal discussion with the PrimeMinister, or the Chairman of the appropriateMinisterial Committee.)(b) A   question   might   raise   issues  which   concerned   anumber of other Departments, which would have tobe consulted before a decision was reached. In sucha case the matter would normally either be discussedinformally between the representatives of the Depart-ments concerned, or submitted to the appropriate WarCabinet Committee. The matter might be finallydisposed of in this way, or some issue might emergewhich had to be submitted to the War Cabinet.War Cabinet Committees.5. Only the principal Committees have been included in theChart. The Terms of Eeference of these Committees are set outin the Appendix to these Notes.6.   There   are,   in   addition,   a   number   of   Committees &apos;composed of officials of the Departments concerned, including,where appropriate,  Service representatives, which  deal  withmatters of common interest to a number of Departments andensure co-ordination of action in particular fields.7. As in the case of the War Cabinet, representatives ofDepartments not permanently represented on Committees areinvited to attend meetings when matters which concern theDepartments are under consideration.8. The Minister of Production^ Council is not a Committeeof the War Cabinet, but functions under the cegis of the Ministerof Production.The War Cabinet Secretariat.9. The War Cabinet Secretariat comprises, on theadministrative plane, the Secretary of the War Cabinet, theDeputy Secretary (Military), two Under-Secretaries (Civil), anda number of Assistant Secretaries drawn from the FightingServices and the Civil Service, who between them handle thebusiness of the War Cabinet and its Committees and Sub-
Committees. The functions of the Secretariat in this connec-tion include the arrangement of meetings, the preparation ofagenda papers, the circulation of memoranda, the drawing-upand circulation of minutes and the drafting of reports. Incarrying out these functions, the members of the Secretariatact on the instructions of the Prime Minister, of Chairmen ofCommittees and of other Ministers concerned.10. The Military Assistant Secretaries, under the DeputySecretary (Military) who is also Chief Staff Officer &apos; to theMinister of Defence also constitute the Staff of the Office ofthe Minister of Defence, which forms an integral part of theOffices of the War Cabinet.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,2lst June, 1944.

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT0CONFIDENTIAL. CoPY No.   (*Uth September, 1944.FUNCTIONS OF THE CABINET SECRETARIAT.Memorandum by the Secretary of the War Cabinet.I.1. The functions of the Cabinet Secretariat have never been defined in anylegal instrument, or other formal document. The natural starting point for anexamination into the scope of the office is therefore to see what duties it hasperformed in the past. This has been done in the annexed Historical Notepages (6-21)* to which reference is made in the paragraphs which follow.Taking a broad view, the main duties performed by the Cabinet Secretariatmay be grouped into the following three classes : (1) normal secretarial duties for the Cabinet and its Committees;(2) preparation of material and collation of information on mattersaffecting several departments;(3) duties involving correspondence.This classification errs on the side of over-simplification, and each group of dutiestends to merge into the others.II.Normal Secretarial Duties.2.   The first class, described as &quot; normal secretarial duties,&quot; comprises : (i) The arrangement of meetings.(ii) The reproduction and circulation of agenda, memoranda and otherdocuments.(iii) The drafting and circulation of minutes and conclusions.(iv) Follow-up action on conclusions to make sure that they are carried out.(v) The drafting of reports.(vi) The custody and indexing of records.This list corresponds broadly with the description of the duties of the WarCabinet Secretariat given in the War Cabinet Report for the year 1917(H.N., paragraph 9).3. The continued performance of these duties for the Cabinet itself, andfor Cabinet Committees, by a central secretariat will, it is thought, be acceptedas justified by experience. The arguments in favour can be summarised asfollows : (i) The administrative officers who comprise this secretariat are free todevote themselves to committee business, and can therefore give abetter and more rapid service than can be given by officers who arealso engaged on other duties.(ii) It is believed that Departments attach importance to the recording ofminutes and conclusions being carried out by a central and impartialsecretariat.(iii) By concentrating this work in a single office, a system can be devisedand maintained which lends itself to the rapid reproduction andcirculation of documents on a uniform basis.(iv) The contacts between the members of the Secretariat, working in thesame office under the general supervision exercised by the seniormembers of the Secretariat, are of great importance in avoiding over-lapping and gaps between the work of various committees,(v) It is of advantage that Departments can look to a single body forinformation on all questions connected with the proceedings of CabinetCommittees and associated bodies.* References to the Historical Note are made as follows:  &quot; H.N., paragraph   ...&quot;
Preparation of Material and Collation of Information on Mattersaffecting several Departments.4. In the historical memorandum several references will be found to thesecond class of duties, namely, the preparation of material and collation ofinformation on matters affecting several departments.  Thus (a) The Esher Committee contemplated that the Secretariat of the C.I.D.should do work of this type.   (H.N., paragraph 4.)(b) In the Treasury Minute of 1904 one of the duties of the C.I.D. Secretariatwas to collate and co-ordinate information for the Committee, andto prepare memoranda or other documents which might be required.(H.N., footnote to paragraph 4.)(c) The Secretariat of the Committee of Civil Research was to act as aCentral Staff, with the duty of giving continuous study on behalf ofthe Committee to the development of research in relation to civilpolicy and administration.   (H.N., paragraph 29.)(d) The work of the Economic Section and of the Central Statistical Officefalls into this group.   (H.N., paragraphs 53-54.)(e) On the military side of the office this class of work is performed by theJoint Planning and Joint Intelligence Staffs, which are composed ofmembers of the Planning and Intelligence Staffs of the Service Depart-ments (working in co-operation, as necessary, with representatives ofthe Civil Departments), the necessary secretarial duties beingperformed by the War Cabinet Secretariat.5. The collation of information and views from several Departments, inthe form of draft memoranda or telegrams for consideration by a Committee, isa natural development of normal Secretarial duties, and as such is performed toa greater or less extent by all Committee Secretaries. It is an obvious help to aCommittee if work of this kind can be entrusted to officers whose concern is tolook at the subject from a wider point of view than that of any particularDepartment, and who are not distracted by day-to-day executive duties. Never-theless, the extent to which work of this kind should be entrusted to the CabinetSecretariat and the manner in which it should be done, give rise to someimportant questions.6. Speaking broadly, the extent to which there is scope for work of thisnature depends on how far work which has to be done in preparation for theformulation of policy in a particular field cannot be carried out within a singleDepartment, but calls for constant co-operation between several Departments atvarious levels. It has been clearly established in the field of defence that therewill be a continuing need for work of this character. But the future of theJoint Staff organisation which handles these questions depends on the futureof our Defence organisation generally a subject outside the scope of thisMemorandum.7. It is sometimes suggested that the methods which have been adopted inthe preparation of military plans and preparations could usefully be applied inthe civil sphere, particularly where there is scope for forward planning in thefield of several Departments. The analogy between the military and civil spheresis, of course, far from complete and, indeed, in some respects may be misleading.Thus, there is normally no officer in a civil department who is charged with dutiescomparable with those of the Director of Plans in a Service Department, namely,the preparation of strategic appreciations and outline plans for future operations!Again, the common concern of each of the Service Departments in defence plansor appreciations is clear and obvious. But in any particular field of civil policv,the various civil Departments are interested in different ways and in differentdegrees, according to the extent and nature of the connection between theobjectives of Government policy in that field and the matters within the scope ofthe Department.8. On the other hand, the trend of events in recent years has been toemphasise the common economic background of many political and social problemsand trade questions, and the extent to which these matters interact upon oneanother.    Moreover, such questions are apt to overlap  the boundaries  of
departmental responsibility and are thus not easily handled by departmentalmachinery alone. This is* the main factor which seems likely to lead to thesetting up of a series of standing ministerial committees under the Cabinet onthe lines set out in the Memorandum considered by the Machinery of GovernmentCommittee (see M.G. (43) 2 (2nd Revise)) dealing comprehensively with a numberof important spheres of Government business. If such a system is established,it would seem that there is likely to be increased scope for the central preparationof memoranda on matters affecting a number of Departments.9. Should the preparation of such documents be carried out by theadministrative staff of the Cabinet Secretariat? &apos; Or by separate sections of theCabinet Secretariat with specialised knowledge, such as the Economic Section ?Or should recourse be had to an arrangement whereby representatives of theDepartments concerned come together to work as part of a single team in theCabinet Offices? This last is really only an extension of the &quot;working party &quot;technique and corresponds broadly with the Joint Staff organisation in themilitary sphere.10. The extent to which each of these different methods should be employedis largely a matter to be tested by experience. But two points are clear. First,that none of these methods will be successful unless the confidence of theinterested Departments is maintained to the full. Secondly, that where it is aquestion of work which is preparatory to the formulation of policy, it is notenough for Departments to regard the Cabinet Secretariat as a body which actsimpartially between Departments. They must feel that their own officers aretaking their due share in the work.IV.correspondence.11. The third class of duty consists in the conduct on behalf of a Committee,in consultation with the Departments concerned, of correspondence with personsor bodies, either in this country or overseas, who are not responsible to (or theconcern of) a single Departmental Minister. Examples of this type of duty areto be found as follows in the Historical Memorandum : (a) the function of acting as the channel of communication between HisMajesty&apos;s Government and the League of Nations (1919-22) [H.N.,paragraph 15];(b) the correspondence on behalf of the Chiefs of Staff Committee and theJoint Intelligence Sub-Committee with Commanders-in-Chief abroad,and with the Joint Staff Mission in Washington [H.N., paragraphs 42,44 and 67];(c) the supervision of the Area Boards by the Production ExecutiveSecretariat from 1940 to 1942 [H.N., paragraph 57];(d) the correspondence of the North American Supply Committee Secretariat[H.N.. paragraphs 58 to 61];(e) the correspondence of the Allied Supplies Executive Secretariat [H.N.,paragraphs 62 and 63];(/) the correspondence of the Allied African Economic Affairs Secretariat[H.N., paragraph 64].12. It is accepted constitutional doctrine that responsibility to the publicmust be through Ministers, and cannot be shifted to the Cabinet Committeeorganisation. It would be inconsistent with this doctrine for the Secretariat ofa Cabinet Committee to have correspondence involving communications with thegeneral public, or to issue to other bodies or authorities in the name not of aresponsible Minister, but of a Cabinet Committee, instructions or directions suchas might be publicly called in question. For this reason the conduct of corres-pondence on behalf of a Cabinet Committee (save of a purely routine nature) isa development which requires to be closely watched.13.   It is to be observed, however, that the correspondence on supplyquestions now conducted by the Secretariats of the North American SupplyCommittee and the Allied Supplies Executive, and previously by the Allied[32044] b 2
African Economic Affairs Secretariat is, in effect, carried out on behalf of a groupof Departments, one or more of whom are interested in the subject-matter of eachtelegram. The communications sent receive the approval of the Department orDepartments concerned, who are prepared, if need be, to accept responsibility forthem. Furthermore, the correspondence is conducted with some authority abroad,who has to take into account the interests of all the British Departmentsconcerned. One of the dominant motives has been the need for a centralisedchannel of communication to cover a field common to several Departments.14. The question whether such correspondence will require to be conductedon behalf of Cabinet Committees after the war depends largely on the continuedexistence of the various Governmental agencies or authorities abroad with whomsuch correspondence is now conducted. From the point of view of the CabinetOffice, it cannot be said that correspondence of this nature has been a source ofanxiety on the score of a possible conflict with the constitutional doctrine referredto in paragraph 12. But there is a tendency for such correspondence on supplyquestions to become involved in matters of relative detail somewhat apart fromthe general issues of policy normally dealt with on Cabinet Committees. On thesegrounds alone it is probably undesirable that the Cabinet Office should at any timehandle more than a small volume of work of this character, though it maysometimes be advantageous on balance that the Cabinet Office should undertakeresponsibility for a section of such work in its initial stages before it is clear thatany particular Department can conveniently accept primary responsibilitytherefor [see paragraph 15 (c) below].V.Other Miscellaneous Duties.15. The preceding paragraphs have dealt with the secretarial duties,whether interpreted narrowly or widely, which form the hard core of the functionsof the Office. But the nature of the work makes it impossible to set clearboundaries which should in all cases be worked up to but never crossed. Just assecretarial work in the strict sense leads naturally to the collation of material forcommittees, so the work of framing conclusions, on which Departments are to act,and the following up of those conclusions on occasion leads on to other tasks. Thefollowing are examples :-(ta) when some new problem arises, which has to be tackled urgently, it is notalways the case that primary responsibility is readily accepted by anysingle Department. In such cases a senior officer of the CabinetSecretariat may arrange an informal meeting in order to resolve thedifficulty;(b) again, it is one of the duties of the Secretary of the Cabinet to makesubmissions to the Prime Minister about the Cabinet Committeeorganisation. This subject is closely related to the distribution ofGovernment business and the machinery of Government generally.The senior officers of the Cabinet Secretariat thereby gain aninsight into current problems in these spheres, and are in a positionto make some contribution towards their solution, in co-operation withthe Treasury;(c) during the war the Cabinet Office has from time to time accepted responsi-bility, as a temporary arrangement, for organisations which could noteasily be attached to some other Office or Department. Occasions maywell &quot;arise in future when it is convenient for the Cabinet Office toprovide a temporary home for some organisation, before it can bedetermined to which of several Departments its work will prove mostclosely allied;(d) the Cabinet Office is often asked to assume responsibility for secretarialarrangements for conferences, whether at home or overseas.16. It would be a mistake to seek to embody miscellaneous duties of thiskind in anv formal charter. They can be regarded, in the aggregate, as providinga valuable measure of flexibility in the scope of the functions of the Office on whichthe successful performance of much of the work depends and, as such, are bestsettled in the future as in the past by friendly arrangement and co-operationwith other Departments.
Summary.17.   On the basis of past experience, the following general conclusions areput forward : (1) The office can best fulfil its duties if it continues to retain its essentialunity civil and military officers working alongside one another,carrying out their business on the same system and keeping in theclosest touch with one another. No other method is so well calculatedto ensure that decisions in one part of the Government machine areimmediately made known in all other parts which are affected by it,that overlapping between the work of different committees is avoidedand that there is coherence in the handling of interlocking questions.(2) The advantages which follow from the close contact between all membersof the administrative staff, civil and military, can only be securedif the administrative staff does not grow too large, although someexpansion in both, and particularly in the civil administrative staff,above the pre-1939 figures must be looked for.(3) If the staff of the Cabinet Office is to carry out the duties expectedof it successfully, it should consist in the main of officers drawn fromthe Services and from civil Departments seconded for periods whichmight vary between, say, two and four years For the sake ofcontinuity, however, there must be a small number of officers withlonger service.(4) The above points are in practice probablv of greater importance than anyvery precise definition of the functions of the Cabinet Secretariat.In general, however, it would seem that the main duties of the CabinetOffice on the civil side should continue to be what have been describedas the normal secretarial duties. The extent of the work of thischaracter will depend largely on the system of Standing MinisterialCommittees established after the war. It seems likely, however, thatthere will be an increase in the work hitherto done in preparationof material and collation of information on matters affecting severalDepartments.(5) The future of the military side of the office depends on the future ofour defence organisation generally, which is not dealt with in thisMemorandum.(6) Besides the above, there are a number of subsidiary and miscellaneousduties which it is thought can usefully be performed by the CabinetOffice. But these are best left to be a matter of arrangement from timeto time in consultation with the Departments affected, and not madethe subject of any formal definition.(Signed)      E. E.

I. Introductory.1. This memorandum has been written to provide the historical backgroundnecessary for consideration of the functions of the Cabinet Secretariat, and of theSecretariat of the Committee of Imperial Defence from which it sprang. Fromthe nature of the case the memorandum deals almost as much with the changesin the interdepartmental organisations which these Secretariats serve as withthe Secretariats themselves. The account has been deliberately confined to a barefactual record of the changes which have taken place.2. Part of the work of the office is mainly or wholly military, and part ismainly or wholly civil. It is therefore convenient in this memorandum to speakof the military and civil sides of the office. But much of the work concerns bothmilitary and civil matters, and the office as a whole is conducted as a single unitdealing with civil and military questions alike.II.-Up to the Great War (1904-14).Esher Report and Creation of Committee of Imperial Defence, 1904.3.   Defects in our defensive preparations revealed by the South AfricanWar led to the appointment of the Esher Committee to make recommendationsfor the reconstitution of the War Office.  The Committee reached the conclusion*that the grave evils which the recent war had disclosed &quot; must in great part betraced to a deeper source than defects in the administration of the War Office &quot;and that &quot; no measure of War Office reform will avail unless it is associated withprovision for obtaining and collating for the use of the Cabinet all the informa-tion and the expert advice required for the shaping of national policy in war,and for determining the necessary preparations in peace.&quot;  The Committeerecognised that this function was intended to be performed by the DefenceCommittee of the Cabinet, established in 1896 and remodelled in 1902 to includeboth the political and professional heads of the Navy and Army.   But in theirview &apos;&apos; a Committee which contains no permanent nucleus and which is composedof political and professional members, each preoccupied with administrativeduties widely differing, cannot deal adequately with the complex questions ofImperial Defence.   Valuable as is the work which this Committee has accom-pished. the fact remains that there is no one charged with the duty of makinga continuous study of these questions, of exercising due foresight in regard tothe changing conditions produced by external developments, and of drawing fromthe several Departments of State, and arranging in convenient form for the useof the Cabinet such information as may at any moment be required.&quot;   TheCommittee went on to urge the immediate provision of what is described as&quot; the corner-stone of the needed edifice of Reform.&quot; namely, a small permanentstaff for the Defence Committee &quot; as the only valid guarantee that vitallyimportant work with which no one is now charged shall be continuously andconsistently carried on, and that the Prime Minister shall have at his disposalall the information needed for the due fulfilment of his weighty responsibilities.&quot;4.   The Esher Committee summarised as follows the duties to be performedby the permanent staff of the Defence Committee : (1) To consider all questions of Imperial Defence from the point of view ofthe Navy, the Military Forces, India and the Colonies.(2) To obtain and collate information from the Admiralty. War Office, IndiaOffice, Colonial Office, and other Departments of State.(3) To prepare any documents required by the Prime Minister and theDefence Committee, anticipating their needs as far as possible.(4) To furnish such advice as the Committee may ask for in regard to Defencequestions involving more than one Department of State.(5) To keep adequate records for the use of the Cabinet of the day and ofits successors.* Report of War Office (Reconstitution) Committee, Part I, dated 11th January, 1904 Cd. 1943.
bOn the basis of the Esher Committee&apos;s recommendations, the Defence Committeewas replaced by the Committee of Imperial Defence, which was provided with apermanent staff consisting of a Secretary, two Assistant Secretaries and thenecessary clerical assistance^The Committee of Imperial Defence, 1904-14.5. For present purposes, it is unnecessary to give a detailed account of thework of the Committee of Imperial Defence in tlhe years 1904-14. Broadlyspeaking, this fell into two categories. First, it hammered out principles onsuch matters as the respective roles of the Army and Navy, the defence of theBritish Isles against sea-borne attack, the defence of India, and coast defencesthroughout the Empire. Secondly, it surveyed the possibilities and demands ofa Great War and supervised the preparation of detailed war plans. This lattertask covered the field of the Civil Departments of State as well as the ServiceDepartments and was carried out through a series of Sub-Committees, on whichService and Civil Departments alike were represented.tHistorical Section.6. In 1907, the Committee of Imperial Defence accepted the recommenda-tion of a Sub-Committee that the work of preparing histories of naval andmilitary operations should be concentrated and placed under the Committee ofImperial Defence. A short account of the scope of the Section, since it was setup in 1907, is contained in Appendix I.III.-Great War Period, 1914-18.Outbreak of War, 1914.7. The outbreak of war led to a decline in the work of the Committee ofImperial Defence and its Sub-Committees; after February 1915 it ceased tomeet. Its functions as an advisory Defence Committee to the Cabinet were takenover by a War Council, which was in turn superseded, first by the DardanellesCommittee, and later by a War Committee. The Committee of ImperialDefence Secretariat provided the Secretariat for all these bodies.Formation of the War Cabinet, December 1916.8. In December 1916 Mr. Lloyd George, on becoming Prime Minister,formed a AVar Cabinet and established a War Cabinet Secretariat. This Secre-tariat was founded upon and absorbed the Secretariat of the Committee ofImperial Defence. Its secretarial technique was modelled on that developed bythe Committee of Imperial Defence Secretariat in the preceding 12 years.* The duties of the Secretariat as defined in Treasury Minute of 4th May, 1904 (Cd. 2200)differed from and were somewhat more restricted than the above recommendations of theEsher Committee.  The relevant passage of the Treasury Minute reads as follows :  &quot; The Secretariat of the Defence Committee will be in direct relation with, and underthe direct control of the Prime Minister.   Its duties may be defined as follows:  (1) to preserve a record of the deliberations and decisions of the Committee;(2) to collect and co-ordinate for the use of the Committee information bearing on thewide problem of Imperial Defence, and to prepare any memoranda or otherdocuments which may be required for the purposes of the Committee;(3) to make possible a continuity of method in the treatment of the questions whichmay from time to time come before the Committee.As the Committee is itself only a consultative or advisory body, so the Secretariatwill have no administrative or executive functions.Any decisions arrived at by the Committee which require executive action must, ofcourse, be carried out under the directions and on the responsibility of the Minister in chargeof the Department concerned. In the same way any information required by the Committeefrom a Department will be procured only in such a&quot; manner as the Head of&quot; the Departmentmay from time to time direct.&quot;f See &quot;The Machinery of the Committee of Imperial Defence,&quot; a lecture given to theU0thaj&apos;Unlt1939erV1CeS InStltutl0D by MaJor-General Ismay (now General Sir Hastings Ismay),
Duties of War Cabinet Secretariat, 1916-189. A detailed description of the War Cabinet system in the last war isgiven in the War Cabinet Report for the year 1917.* The principal duties ofthe War Cabinet Secretariat are there described as being (i) to record the proceedings of the War Cabinet;(ii) to transmit the decisions to Departments concerned in giving effect tothem or otherwise interested;(iii) to prepare agenda papers; arrange for the attendance of Ministers andother persons concerned, and procure and circulate documents requiredfor discussion;(iv) to attend to correspondence connected with the work of the WarCabinet;(v) to prepare weekly reports by arrangements with the Secretaries of Statefor Foreign Affairs, India and the Colonies, on matters on which thoseMinisters were concerned.A number of matters were referred by the War Cabinet either to individualmembers of the War Cabinet or to Committees of Ministers to decide. The WarCabinet Secretariat provided the secretarial staff for most of these Committeesand enquiries.10. The War Cabinet Report for the year 1918t gives details of &quot; the morepermanent War Cabinet Committees,&quot; namely-&apos;(a) War Priorities Committee : set up in September 1917, having severalsub-committees;(b) Eastern Committee : set up in March 1918;(cj Economic Defence and Development Committee: set up in June 1918:(a) Home Affairs Committee: set up in June 1918;(e) Demobilisation Committee.The Home Affairs Committee, by its terms of reference, dealt with questionsof internal policy and such domestic questions as required the co-operation ofmore than one Department.  A Committee on these lines has continued ever since.11. The War Cabinet Secretariat also provided the British Section of theSecretariat of the Inter-Allied Conferences of the Supreme War Council atVersailles, and of the Imperial War Cabinet.IV.-Inter-War Period 1918-39.Haldane Committee Report, 1918.12. The Haldane Committee&apos;s Report on the Machinery of Government^:contained the following passage (paragraph 10) : &quot; But we think that there is one feature in the procedure of the WarCabinet which mav well assume a permanent form, namely, the appointmentof a Secretary to the Cabinet charged with the duty of collecting and puttinginto shape its agenda, of providing the information and material necessary,and of drawing up records of the results for communication to the Depart-ments concerned.&quot;Separation of Cabinet Secretariat from C.I.D. Secretariat, 1919.13. In November 1919, when the War Cabinet was replaced by a Cabinet ofnormal size, it was decided to retain a Secretary of the Cabinet, with the necessarystaff, as a permanent arrangement. At the same time, the Committee of ImperialDefence was revived. The Secretary of the War Cabinet was appointed Secretaryboth of the Cabinet and of the Committee of Imperial Defence, g The Secretariatof the Cabinet was separated from the Secretariat of the Committee of ImperialDefence, but under their common head the two Secretariats occupied the samebuilding, shared the same common services and were known as the Offices of theCabinet and the Committee of Imperial Defence.&quot;* Cd. 9005, pages 2 and 3. t Cnid. 325.I Cd. 9230. 5 In 1923 Sir Maurice Hankey also became Clerk of the Privy Council.
Cabinet Office Vote 1921-22, and Debate thereon.14. During the period 1904-21, the Committee of Imperial Defence andits offspring, the Cabinet Office, had been borne on the Vote for the Treasury andSubordinate Departments. In April 1921 the Cabinet Office was converted into aseparate department with its own Parliamentary Vote. In the debate on theCabinet Office Estimates in the House of Commons on the 13th June, 1922,*considerable criticism was directed not only against the size of the CabinetSecretariat, but also against the scope or alleged scope of the duties performed,and even against the very principle of a Cabinet Secretariat. A motion to reducethe Vote was defeated by 205 votes to 111.15. The size of the Secretariat at that time was due in part to the factthat it was responsible for providing the secretarial staff for InternationalConferences, which were of frequent occurrence, and had also, since 1919,constituted the channel of communication between the British Government andthe League of Nations.16. Following the formation of Mr. Bonar Law&apos;s Government in October1922, these responsibilities were transferred to the Foreign Office and a con-siderable reduction was effected in the staff of the Cabinet Secretariat. Atthe same time the Cabinet Office was restored to the Vote of the Treasury andSubordinate Departments, where it has since remained.Military Changes in the Inter-War Period (paragraphs 17-24).17. During the inter-war period much of the work of the Committee ofImperial Defence was carried on through a large number of sub-committeesdealing, for example, with questions relating to organisation for war, man-poweror supply. For the purpose of this memorandum it is proposed to refer onlyto the more significant developments.  These are : (a) the emergence of a group of committees dealing with strategic andplanning questions. i.e., the Chiefs of Staff Committee, the JointPlanning Committee, and the Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee;(b) the appointment in 1936 of a Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.Establishment of Chiefs of Staff Committee, 1923.18. In 1923 a Committee on National and Imperial Defence, presided overby Lord Salisbury, reportedt that the existing system of co-ordination by theCommittee of Imperial Defence was not sufficient to secure full initiative andresponsibility in relation to defence policy as a whole, and recommended thecreation of the Chiefs of Staff Committee. This recommendation was approved,the Committee being set up as a sub-committee of the Committee of ImperialDefence.19. The responsibilities of the Chiefs of Staff Committee are bestsummarised in the following quotation from the Salisbury Committee&apos;s report: &quot; In addition to the functions of the Chiefs of Staff as advisers onquestions of sea, land, or air policy respectively to their own Board orCouncil, each of the three Chiefs of Staff will have an individual andcollective responsibility for advising on defence policy as a whole, the threeconstituting as it were a super-chief of a War Staff in commission.&quot;Creation of Joint Planning Committee, 1927.20. Experience showed that, for the proper exercise of their jointresponsibility for advising on defence policy as a whole, the Chiefs of Staffrequired a staff in addition to the Secretariat of the Committee of ImperialDefence. This led to the establishment in 1927 of a Joint Planning Committee.This Committee had its office in the Office of the Committee of Imperial Defence,its constituent members being the Directors of Plans of the three ServiceDepartments. This organisation has since been greatly expanded (see para-graphs 22 and 43).Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, 1936.21.   In February 1936 a Minister for Co-ordination of Defence wasappointed, to whom the following duties were delegated by the Prime Minister :-(i) The day-to-day supervision and control on the Prime Ministers behalfof the whole organisation and activity of the Committee of ImperialDefence.* Official Report, 5th Series, Volume 155, Cols. 213 to 278. 1 Cmd. 1938.
(ii) In the Prime Minister&apos;s absence, taking the chair at the Committee ofImperial Defence.(iii) The personal consultation with the Chiefs of Staff together, includinga right to convene under his Chairmanship the Chiefs of StaffCommittee whenever he or they thought desiraole.(iv) The Chairmanship of the principal Supply Officers Committee.*22. At the same time steps were taken to strengthen the Secretariat of theCommittee of Imperial Defence and to supplement the Joint Planning Committeeby staff officers drawn from the Navy, Army and Air Force.Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee, 1938.23. The Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee was set up in 1938 as a sub-committee of the Chiefs of Staff Committee. At the outset it comprised thethree deputy directors of the Service Intelligence Departments. By the out-break of war it consisted of a representative of the Foreign Office in the Chairand the three Directors of Intelligence of the Service Departments.The Chiefs of Staff Secretariat.24. The staff of the Committee of Imperial Defence provided the Secretariatof the Chiefs of Staff Committee, the Joint Planning Committee and the JointIntelligence Sub-Committee. Like the Chiefs of Staff themselves, the membersof the Joint Planning Committee and the Joint Intelligence Sub-Committeecontinued, of course, to hold appointments in their own Services or Departments,but met together for the work of their Committees in the Offices of the Committeeof Imperial Defence.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence also had his office in the Officesof the Cabinet and Committee of Imperial Defence and, apart from one personalassistant, was served by the Secretariat of the Committee of Imperial Defence.The Civil Work of the Office in the Inter-War Period (paragraphs 25-32).The Secretarial Work of the Cabinet.25. This calls for no special comment and followed the general lines set outin the War Cabinet Report for 1917, subject to the cessation of the extraneouswar duty of preparing reports on foreign and overseas matters (see para-graph 9 (v)).26. It should perhaps be added that, when the normal peace-time Cabinetwas restored in 1919, it became the practice that only one member of the CabinetSecretariat (the Secretary of the Cabinet or, in his absence, the Deputy Secretary)should attend meetings of the Cabinet. The Secretary thus, besides being thepermanent head of the Office, has direct personal responsibility to the PrimeMinister for all arrangements connected with the Meetings of the Cabinet forexample, Agenda, circulation of Papers. Minutes of Meetings, &amp;c.Cabinet Committees.27. A very large number of Cabinet Committees were appointed in theinter-war period, probably over 500 in all. It was the general practice for theCabinet Secretariat to provide either the Secretary of these Committees, or aJoint Secretary with a member of the staff of the Department primarily concerned.All but a handful of these Committees were ad hoc bodies appointed to settle someparticular difficulty and held only a few meetings or sat for only a month or so.28. The only Standing Committee which spanned the whole period was theHome Affairs Committee, whose functions included those of the present Legis-lation Committee, but for most of the period were considerably wider. From1936 to the outbreak of war there was also a Standing Committee on ForeignPolicy, and there were a number of fairly long-lived Committees on variousaspects of Imperial Affairs India, Ireland, Palestine are examples. In thedomestic sphere, there were a series of Committees on Unemployment, some ofwhich extended over a considerable period, and others on Agricultural Policy andmatters affecting the Fighting Services. There was, however, no regular systemof Standing Cabinet Committees designed to provide a forum to which subjectsof common interest to several Departments in the main fields of Government policycould be taken for discussion before submission to the Cabinet.* Cmd. 5107.
Committee of Civil Research, 1925.29. In June 1925 a Committee of Civil Research was appointed, the Secretariat of which was provided by the Cabinet Secretariat, which was strengthenedfor the purpose. The Committee was designed* to meet the need for &quot; anorganisation under the ultimate direction of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet,charged with the duty of giving continuous forethought, from a central stand-point, to the development of economic and statistical research in relation moreespecially to problems of an interdepartmental character or in. pursuit ofknowledge in spheres not within the orbit of any single Minister.&quot;! TheCommittee was organised on the analogy of the Committee of Imperial Defence.It was intended that, like the Secretariat of the Committee of Imperial Defence,the Secretariat of the Committee of Civil Research should not only be responsiblefor performing secretarial duties, but should act as a central staff with the dutyof giving continuous study, on behalf of the Committee, to the development ofresearch in relation to civil policy and administration.Economic Advisory Council, 1930.30. In January 1930 the Committee of Civil Research was replaced by theEconomic Advisory Council.i.  Its terms of reference were : (1) To advise His Majesty&apos;s Government in economic matters.(2) To make continuous study of developments in trade and industry and inthe use of National and Imperial resources, of the effect of legislationand fiscal policy at home and abroad, and of all aspects of National,Imperial and International economy with a bearing on the prosperityof the country.31. Provided that it acted after securing the approval of the Prime Minister,the Council might initiate enquiries into and advise upon any subject fallingwithin its scope, including proposals for legislation. The Council was to consultDepartments and outside authorities in regard to any work in hand or projectedand was to collate such statistical or other information as might be required forthe performance of its work.32. Like the Committee of Civil Research, the Economic Advisory Councilrequired a permanent staff to carry out on its behalf the day-to-day work requiredby its terms of reference. The Secretariat, which formed part of the CabinetSecretariat, comprised a Secretary, and Assistant Secretaries, at least two ofwhom were economists, and provision was made for the addition to the Secretariatof such other staff as might prove to be necessary in practice.Changes made on the Retirement of Sir Maurice Hankey, 1938.33. In July 1938 Sir Maurice Hankey, who held the offices of Secretary ofthe Cabinet, Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence and Clerk of thePrivy Council, retired.34. The Offices of the Cabinet and Committee of Imperial Defence wereamalgamated as from the 1st August, 1938, under the title &quot;Offices of theCabinet, Committee of Imperial Defence, Economic Advisory Council andMinister for Co-ordination of Defence.&quot; Sir Maurice Hankey&apos;s successor wasdescribed as &quot; Permanent Secretary and Secretary of the Cabinet,&quot; and wasmade the responsible official head of the whole composite office, in general charge ofits various activities and its personnel. His two deputies were styled respectively&quot;Clerk of the Privy Council! and Deputy Secretary of the Cabinet&quot; and&quot; Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence.&quot;Summary of the Position at the Outbreak of War, 1939.35. In August 1939 the Cabinet Office was, therefore, an office half civil andhalf military, providing the secretarial staff for the Cabinet and CabinetCommittees, * for the Economic Advisory Council, and for the Committee ofImperial Defence and all its many sub-committees. The Office also served theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence.* Cmd. 2440. t CP. 195 (25). t Cmd. 3478.5 Since 1942 the post of Clerk of the Privy Council has been separated from the post ofDeputy Secretary (Civil) of the War Cabinet.
V. Changes since 1939.36.   Changes since 1939 are best described under the following heads : (i) Military Work of the Office.(ii) War Cabinet and General Civil Committees.(iii) Economic Affairs and Statistics.(iv) Supply Questions,(v) Overseas Questions.As stated at the outset, many of the changes recorded in this memorandumare changes not in the Cabinet Secretariat but in the interdepartmental organisa-tions which it serves. But these changes need to be set out since they nave adirect bearing on the functions of the Secretariat.(i) Military Work of the Office (paragraphs 37-44).Formation of War Cabinet and Suspension of C.I.D., September 1939.37. Immediately on the outbreak of war the Government was reconstitutedand a War Cabinet was appointed. The Committee of Imperial Defence wassuspended, the Chiefs of Staff becoming the advisers not of that body but of theWar Cabinet. The Cabinet and Committee of Imperial Defence Secretariats,the working of which had in fact been little altered by the change made in 1938,were fully merged into a single War Cabinet Secretariat.A bolition of the Office of Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, 1940.38. In April 1940 the Office of Minister for Co-ordination of Defencelapsed. The Chairmanship of the Military Co-ordination Committee, set up inOctober 1939 and comprising the Service Ministers and Chiefs of Staff, wasthereupon taken over by the First Lord of the Admiralty (Mr. Churchill), who,in the performance of this duty, was assisted by the Military Staff of the WarCabinet Secretariat under Major-General Ismay. who was also appointed amember of the Chiefs of Staff Committee.Creation of the Office of Minister of Defence, 1940.39. On the 10th May. 1940, when Mr. Churchill formed his Government,he assumed office as Prime Minister and Minister of Defence. Major-GeneralIsmay, who since the outbreak of war has been described as Deputy Secretary(Military) of the War Cabinet, became also Chief of Staff to the Minister ofDefence. General Ismay and certain military officers on the Chiefs of StaffSecretariat constitute the staff of the Office of the Minister of Defence. Allthe members of this staff are at the same time members of the War CabinetSecretariat. There is no separate Vote or Sub-head for the Office of the Ministerof Defence, but the title of the Cabinet Office Sub-head of the Treasury Votehas been changed to &quot; Offices of the War Cabinet and Minister of Defence.&quot;40. The duties of the Prime Minister as Minister of Defence are not, ofcourse, defined in any statute or other legal instrument. The position has beendescribed by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons as follows : &quot; Under the present arrangement the three Chiefs of Staff, sitting almostcontinuously together, carry on the war from day to day, assisted not onlyby the machinery of the great Departments which serve them, but by theCombined General Staff, and making their decisions effective through theNavy. Army and Air Forces over which they exercise direct operationalcontrol. I supervise their activities whether as Prime Minister or Ministerof Defence. I work myself under the supervision and control of the WarCabinet, to whom all important matters are referred.&quot;*41. The Prime Minister made a fuller statement on the subject on the24th February. 1942 (quoted in full in Appendix II), in the course of which hesaid : &quot; I do not, of course, conduct this war from day to day myself. It isconducted from day to day, and in its future outlook, by the Chiefs of StaffCommittee, namely, the First Sea Lord, the Chief of the Imperial General* Official Report, 2nd July, 1942, col. 607.
Staff, and the Chief of the Air Staff. These officers sit together every day,and often twice a day. They give executive directions and orders to theCommanders-in-Chief in the various theatres. They advise me. they advisethe Defence Committee* and the War Cabinet on large questions of warstrategy and war policy.&quot;Duties of the Chiefs of Staff.42. As stated by the Prime Minister, the Chiefs of Staff, in their corporatecapacity, besides their advisory functions, have also acquired certain executiveresponsibilities. Thus, certain of the Commanders-in-Chief overseas are directlyresponsible to the Chiefs of Staff Committee for the operations of the forces of allthree Services under their command. These Commanders-in-Chief communicatedirectly with, and receive instructions from, the Chiefs of Staff Committee.Again, the Chiefs of Staff Committee communicate directly with the UnitedStates Chiefs of Staff through their representatives in Washington, the JointStaff Mission (see paragraph 66).Development of the Joint Staff Organisation.43. The Joint Staffs have been greatly expanded and developed. There isnow a comprehensive Joint Planning and intelligence Staff which provides themeans whereby planning and intelligence work is carried out, covering the sphereof all three Services and bringing in the related civil departments at all stages.This Organisation has been fully described in the White Paper entitled &quot; Organi-sation for Joint Planning,&quot;! though there has been some expansion since then,notably in the creation of a &quot; Joint Administrative Planning Staff &quot; workingalongside the operational planners. The essential feature of this Joint StaffOrganisation is that, under the Directors of Plans and Intelligence, there are anumber of staff officers who are at the same time members of the Joint Planningand Intelligence Staff and of the Planning and Intelligence Staffs of the ServiceDepartments, the senior officers having desks both in the Service Departmentsand in the Offices of the War Cabinet.44. These changes have affected the nature of the duties performed on themilitary side of the office, which provides the secretarial staff for the Chiefs ofStaff Committee and for the Joint Staff developed since 1926. The Secretariatis now called upon to prepare instructions from the Chiefs of Staff to Com-manders-in-Chief. and to handle telegraphic traffic to and from Commanders-in-Chief, the Joint Staff Mission. Washington, and Intelligence Staffs in overseastheatres.(ii) War Cabinet and General Civil Committee (paragraphs 45-52).45. During the war an increasing volume of work has been entrusted toMinisterial Committees of the War Cabinet. Many of these have been ad hocbodies appointed with a very limited reference. There have also been frequentchanges in the committee organisation to meet the changing needs of the warsituation.46. Notwithstanding all these changes (which it is unnecessary to summarisehere), there has been a trend towards the establishment of a series of StandingCommittees, designed to act as a forum for consideration by Ministers, in certainbroad fields of common policy, of matters of interest to several Departments.The function of such committees is either to focus by preliminary discussionthe issues to be submitted to the War Cabinet, or, in appropriate cases, to reachdecisions themselves without reference to the War Cabinet.47. The most important committee in the civil sphere is the Lord President&apos;sCommittee, which was set up in June 1940, and which, since the beginning of1941. has had the specific duty of keeping continuous watch over home front* The Defence Committee (Operations) was set up by the Prime Minister in August, 1940.Its composition has varied somewhat but has always included the Prime Minister (in theChair), the Deputy Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary and the three Service Ministers, withthe Chiefs of Staff in attendance.   Its terms of reference are as follows:  &quot; The Committee keeps under review the main factors in the strategic situation onbehalf of the War Cabinet, including the main outlines of coming operations, and carriesout a preliminary examination of matters specifically referred to it.&quot;t Cmd. &amp;351.
questions and the general trend of our economic development. This Committeehas throughout comprised several members of the War Cabinet, and thus hasrelieved that body of much civil business.48. The Legislation Committee has continued with the functions of con-sidering and improving legislative proposals, including Bills and Regulations.49. Since 1941, there has also been a Ministerial Reconstruction Committee,although the title and composition of the Committee have undergone variouschanges.50. In the field of supply and production, the Minister of Production sCouncil, which has now been in existence for two years, took the place of theProduction Executive (formerly the Production Council), which in turn replaceda Priority Committee of the War Cabinet (see paragraphs 56 and 57).51. The Civil Defence Committee is a lineal descendant of the MinisterialCommittee under the aegis of the Committee of Imperial Defence, 1938.52. The general practice continues whereby the Cabinet Secretariat providesthe Secretary or a Joint Secretary for all the Cabinet Committees: exceptionsare the Reconstruction Committee, for which the Secretariat is now provided bythe Office of the Minister of Reconstruction, and the Minister of Production^Council, for which the Secretariat is provided by the Ministry of Production.(iii) Economic Affairs and Statistics (paragraphs 53 and 54).53. The Economic Advisory Council (see paragraph 30) was disbanded atthe outbreak of war. Shortly afterwards a Central Economic InformationService was developed in the Offices of the War Cabinet, under the aegis of a WarCabinet Committee on Economic Policy. This Service was a small organisationof economists and statisticians recruited from the universities. It was consider-ably expanded after the change of Government in May 1940. In January 1941the statisticians and economists of the Central Economic Information Servicewere separated, the statisticians being formed into the Central Statistical Officeand the economists into the Economic Section of the War Cabinet SecretariateThe functions of the Central Statistical Office cannot here be dealt with in detail.The Office performs a &quot;common service&quot; and collects from GovernmentDepartments a &quot; regular series of figures on a coherent and well-ordered basiscovering the development of the war effort as a whole.&quot; Its work is thus partlycivil and partly military. The figures so collected form an agreed corpus whichis accepted and used not only in interdepartmental discussions but in the prepara-tion of documents for circulation to the War Cabinet and War Cabinet Com-mittees. To an increasing extent the work of collecting and presenting statisticaldata for Cabinet Committees and advising the Secretaries of committees onstatistical questions is now undertaken by the Central Statistical Office.54. The functions of the Economic Section of the War Cabinet Secretariathave been described in a report already circulated to the Committee on Machineryof Government, t In that paper its duties are described as being &quot; to receiveall economic intelligence collected by various Governmental agencies; to cover bytheir own researches any gaps in that intelligence; to make or procure specificstudies in those spheres which are not covered by any one Department; to appraiseeconomic intelligence both general and in particular; and to present co-ordinatedand objective pictures of the economic situation as a whole and the economicaspects of projected Government policies.&quot; The Economic Section, as a regularpart of its work, advises the Lord President on the economic aspects of the workof the Lord Presidents Committee.(iv) Supply Questions (paragraphs 55-65).55. There have been many changes during the war in the responsibility forsupply questions common to several departments. The Cabinet Offices have fromtime to time been called upon to undertake responsibility for matters in thisfield as a temporary measure.* W.P. (G) (41) 12.f Paragraphs 5 and 6 of M.G.O. 32 circulated with M.G. (43) 12.
luThe Home Sphere.56. To take first supply questions in the home sphere. Shortly before theoutbreak of war the peace-time supply organisation of the Committee of ImperialDefence had been transferred to the Ministry of Supply, the only supply functionremaining with the Cabinet Secretariat being the secretarial duties for aMinisterial Priority Committee, replaced in due course by a Production Council.57. On the 30th December, 1940, a Production Executive was set up.*The Secretariat, which was provided by the War Cabinet Secretariat, absorbedthe Central Priority Department of the&quot; Ministry of Supply and the Secretariatsof two of the Priority Sub-Committees of the Production Executive theMaterials Committee and the Industrial Capacity Committee. The ProductionExecutive Secretariat thereby became responsible inter alia for supervising thework of the Area Boards and for the compilation of allocations of capacity. Onthe appointment of a Minister of Production on the 10th February, 1942, theProduction Executive Secretariat was merged in the Ministry of Production.North A mertcan Supplies.58. Shortly before the outbreak of the war, a special section of the WarCabinet Secretariat (the Anglo-French Liaison Section) was established to actas a focus for co-ordinating the various discussions which were proceeding atthat time between a number of French Missions and the various Departmentsconcerned in London. When the arrangements, for Anglo-French co-ordinationwere formalised by the setting-up of the Allied Military Committee andthe Anglo-French Executives and Co-ordinating Committee, the British elementin the secretariats of these bodies was provided by the Anglo-French LiaisonSection of the War Cabinet Secretariat. On the collapse of France this machinery-was dissolved. On the civil side, however, it had, in the field of purchases fromNorth America, acted as a link not only between the British and the French butalso between the various British departments concerned. This latter work had tobe continued and there was accordingly established as part of the War CabinetSecretariat, a Central Office for North American Supplies which was staffed bythe British members of the secretariat of the former Anglo-French Co-ordinatingCommittee and acted under the directions of an official inter-departmentalcommittee under the Chairmanship of a Junior Minister.59. The next stage was the supersession of the official North AmericanSupply Committee by a Ministerial Committee of the same name, of which theCentral Office became a Secretariat. It was part of the duties of the Secretariatto act as a channel of communication between the North American SupplyCommittee and the British Supply Council in North America, which wassimultaneously established in Washington.60. When the Ministry of Production was set up, the Secretariat of theNorth American Supply Committee was merged into a Joint American Secre-tariat. responsible jointly to the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry ofProduction and to the Secretary of the War Cabinet.61. With the development of Anglo-American supply arrangements intoa general pooling of supplies and shipping, under the direction of the CombinedBoards, for use all over the world and with the emergence of semi-politicalsupply problems, such as those connected with supplies for relief, tine workof the Secretariat has altered. It has come to be less of a committee secretariatand rather more of a small central staff helping to focus new problems and inthe necessary adjustments to meet them.A Hied Supplies Executive.62. The decision reached at the Moscow Conference in September 1941 tosend supplies to Russia on a large scale called for some inter-departmentalorganisation. This took the form of a War Cabinet Ministerial Committee (theAllied Supplies Executive)t with a strong secretarial section forming part of theWar Cabinet Offices.63. The Committee deals mainly with supplies to Russia, but also coversTurkey and China. The Secretariat is responsible for preparing supplyprogrammes, in accordance with the policy laid down by the Executive: forauthorising the supply of individual items in accordance with the approvedprogrammes; and for preparing progress reports on the supplies actually* W.P.

despatched. The Secretariat is also the channel of communication between Londonand Washington and between London on the one hand, and Moscow. Angora andChungking on the other, in regard to supplies to Russia, Turkey and Chinarespectively; and, in London, between Departments and the supply representa-tives of those countries.Allied African Economic Affairs Secretariat.64. This Secretariat was set up in December 1942 to meet the need for aco-ordinating section to deal with economic affairs of all French overseas terri-tories except those in the Middle East. The Secretariat serves a Committee whichreports jointly to the Foreign Secretary and the Minister of Production. Muchof the work is of a detailed character and is dealt with either in day-to-daycorrespondence between the Secretariat and Departments or by working parties,without the need for formal committee meetings.65. Responsibility for this work has now been handed over to the Ministryof Production as part of the Joint Secretariat which has been established underthe aegis of that Ministry to deal with supplies to and from liberated andoccupied areas.(v) Overseas Questions (paragraphs 66-71).Joint Staff Mission, Washington.66. Since May 1941 there have been representatives of the Chiefs of Staffin Washington. This Joint Staff Mission now consists of the heads of the threeService Department Missions in Washington under Field-Marshal Sir John Dill.They represent the British Chiefs of Staff vis-a-vis the United States Chiefs ofStaff and normallv attend meetings of the Combined Chiefs of Staff on theirbehalf.67. The Secretariat of the Joint Staff Mission is a detachment of the WarCabinet Secretariat, all its officers having served in the War Cabinet Offices.This Secretariat performs for the Joint Staff Mission functions analogous to thoseperformed for the Chiefs of Staff by the Chiefs of Staff Secretariat. It alsoprovides the British members of the Secretariats of the Combined Chiefs of Staffand its subordinate bodies.British Civil Secretariat, Washington.68. The great increase in the number and importance of the separate BritishMissions in the United States and in the number of committees, both inter-Mission and combined, led in February 1943 to the establishment in Washingtonof a British Civil Secretariat as a detachment of the War Cabinet Secretariat&quot; to perform for the Ambassador, the Minister Resident in Washington forSupply and the heads of the various missions mutatis mutandis, the functionsperformed for Ministers and Departments in London by the War CabinetSecretariat.&quot;69. The British Civil Secretariat provides secretarial services for a numberof committees, including the British Supply Council in North Amsrica andserves as a clearing-house for the day-to-day work of the British Civil Missions.It also circulates to the Heads of Missions such general information as to develop-ments in London as is furnished to it by authorities in this country. Althoughthe Joint Staff Mission and the British Civil Secretariat, which form the militaryand civil branches respectively of the War Cabinet Secretariat in Washington,are housed in different buildings, they follow as far as possible the same patternof co-operation as the military and civil sides of the War Cabinet Secretariatin London.Ministers Resident A broad.70. The war-time measure of appointing Ministers Resident abroad has ledto the need for some arrangement for keeping these Ministers in touch withgeneral Government policy and happenings in this country. Arrangements havebeen made whereby the Secretary of the War Cabinet sends weekly to suchMinisters copies of such Cabinet or Cabinet Committee documents as canappropriately be sent to them under cover of a general informatorv letter. Greatcare is, of course, exercised to ensure that the information contained in theseletters and their enclosures is general background information, and that thereshould be no conflict or confusion with the communications sent to these Ministersby Ministers in this country.
Conferences abroad.71. In the last two years the Prime Minister, accompanied by otherMinisters and by the Chiefs of Staff, has made a number of visits toconferences abroad, with similar delegations from the United States and Russia.On the War Cabinet Office has fallen the responsibility for making the arrange-ments for these conferences and for providing the secretariat. The Office hasalso undertaken responsibility for the secretarial arrangements for the BritishDelegations to several conferences in the United States.VI. Staffing.72 From the inception in 1904 of the Committee of Imperial Defence, themilitary staff of the Committee has been provided by officers of the Navy. RoyalMarines, Army, Indian Army and, since the last war, R.A.F., appointed for atour of duty.73. When it was decided in November 1919 to retain a Secretary of theCabinet with the necessary civil staff as a permanent ariangement, the thenSecretary of the Cabinet proposed that the normal system of recruitment of thecivil administrative staff (dealing with what was then known as &quot; the home sideof the work &quot;) should likewise be found by officers from the Home Civil Serviceseconded to the Cabinet Secretariat for a period of not less than three years.In the event, however, this arrangement was only applied regularly to one post,which was to be filled by the regular secondment of a Treasury official to theCabinet Secretariat, the official so appointed being charged with the duty ofensuring that&apos; proposals involving charges upon the Exchequer received fromdepartments for the consideration of the Cabinet were discussed with theTreasury before submission to the Cabinet, on the understanding that theconstitutional right of Ministers to raise questions at Cabinet whether on theagenda or not, was not prejudiced.* With the exception of this post, the civiladministrative staff of the Cabinet Office from 1919 to 1939 consisted almostwholly of officials permanently transferred to the Cabinet Office from otherDepartments.74. Since 1939 it has, however, been found possible to develop the practiceof providing the civil administrative staff of the Office by secondment.Notwithstanding the difficulties of obtaining permanent staff from otherdepartments during the war, a total of 31 permanent civil servants from otherdepartments have served in administrative posts in the War Cabinet Offices fortours of duty of six months or over since 1939. It has not proved possible toprovide the whole of the war expansion by the loan of permanent civil servants,and a number of temporary officers have also been appointed. The same applieson the military side of the office, where a number of the present military staffare officers holding temporary commissions.75. The Economic Section of the War Cabinet Secretariat and the CentralStatistical Office have been wholly staffed by economists and statisticians whowere not in Government service at the outbreak of war. There, too. there hasbean a considerable measure of interdepartmental transfer.APPENDIX I.Note on the Historical Section.1. The Historical Section owes its origin to a Memorandum written byLord Esher in 1906 urging the importance of forming a Historical Section ofthe Committee of Imperial Defence. After consideration by a sub-committee, theCommittee of Imperial Defence in 1907 accepted the principle thai the work ofpreparing histories of naval and military operations should be concentrated andplaced under the Committee of Imperial Defence.2. There was accordingly established a Historical Section of the Committeeof Imperial Defence working under the supervision of a sub-committee of theCommittee of Imperial Defence, known as the Sub-Committee for the Control ofthe Official Histories.* This arrangement received the specific approval of the Cabinet. (Cabinet 1 (20)Minute 2.)
3. In the years from 1907 to 1913 the Historical Section completed theofficial history of the war in South Africa (previously undertaken by the WarOffice) and compiled an official history of the Russo-Japanese war.4. Neither of these works was a financial success, and in 1913 a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, under the chairmanship ofLord Esher, recommended that in future the Section should not normally attemptthe compilation of histories of wars in which this country had not been abelligerent, but that in such cases it would be sufficient to translate or abridgethe official histories of the belligerents themselves. It was recommended that theHistoric Section could usefully revert to what was originally intended to be oneof its functions, namely, research work. A small staff of one officer and one clerkwas to remain under the control of the Secretary of the Committee of ImperialDefence.Histories of the Great War.5. When war broke out in 1914, an early start was made in tabulatinginformation of historical importance, and from 1915 onwards staff was recruitedfor the purpose of writing the various histories set out in the next paragraph.During the years immediately following the war considerable staff was employed,but the number declined gradually as the various branches of the history werecompleted.6. The following official histories of the war of 1914-18 have been completedby the Historical Section and have been published : Naval Operations ...      ......      ...       5 volumes.Seaborne Trade.........      ...      ...       3      ,,The Merchant Navy     .....:      ...      ...       3      ,,Blockade (Confidential)......      ...      ...        1       ,,Military Operations France and Belgium        ...      ...      ...      10      ,,Egypt and Palestine       ...      ......       2      ,,Gallipoli      ...............       2Macedonia    .........      ...      ...        2       ,,Mesopotamia ......      ...      ...       4      ,,Persia (Confidential)       ...      ...      ...        1East Africa ...      ......      ...      ...        1       ,,West Africa...............        1       ,,Transportation      ...      ...      ...      ...        1       ,,Orders of Battle    ............        4The War in the Air     ............        6&quot; Principal Events&quot;     ......      ...      ...        1       ,,47Four further volumes have been completed and are ready for publication assoon as the paper situation permits : France and Belgium, 1918      ......      ...        2 volumes.Order of Battle...............       2Work is now proceeding on four other volumes : France (Passchendale). 1917    ...      ...      ...        1 volume.France (Cambrai), 1917......      ......        1       ,,Italy       ......      ............        1Occupation of the Rhineland ...      ...      ...        1A final decision has not yet been reached, but it is possible that four morevolumes may eventually be compiled to complete the history of military operationsin the last war :  East Africa       ...............        1 volume.North and South Africa. 1918-20      ......        2 volumes.The Army of the Black Sea, 1918-23......        1 volume.The staff still engaged upon the history of the last war consists of the Headof the Branch, two Narrators and an Assistant.7. The official histories of the last war only covered the civil side of thewar effort to a very limited extent. A history of the Ministry of Munitions inten volumes was written under the auspices of that Ministry, and a medicalhistory was published in 13 volumes.
Histories of the Pmeitt War.8. The planning of Official Histories of the present war is the responsibilityof the War Cabinet Committee for the Control of Official Histories which is thesuccessor of the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence mentionedin the second paragraph of this Note.Service Histories.9. The Historical Section of the War Cabinet Office, formerly the HistoricalSection of the Committee of Imperial Defence, is responsible for preparingNarratives of Military History. A start was made in 1941 and narratives havebeen compiled of the campaigns in France and the Low Countries (1939 to 1940)and in Norway. Work was started at the end of 1943 on the compilation of thenarratives of the campaigns in the Middle East. The staff employed on thehistory of this war consists of the Head of the Branch and five Narrators.10. First narratives of naval and air operations are compiled by theHistorical Section of the Training and Staff Duties Division of the Naval Staffin the Admiralty and the Air Historical Branch of the Air Ministry respectively.11. It is the responsibility of the War Cabinet Office, under the Committeefor the Control of Official Histories, to co-ordinate the work of the three ServiceHistorical Sections and to make preparations for the Official Histories of the warwhich will be based on the first narratives now being prepared.Civil Histories.12. Early in the present war Departments were asked to make arrangementsto set aside material of historical importance. In 1941 a Supervisor of the CivilHistories was appointed and a plan was prepared whereby accounts would bewritten of the main developments of the war effort on the civil side by narratorsworking in the Departments concerned. The total staff at present employed onthis work, and borne on the War Cabinet Office establishment, is as follows : 1 Supervisor.1 Munitions Historian.13 Narrators.3 Research Assistants.13. Although the narrators are stationed in departments, the histories arebeing written on a subject basis. By this method the problems involving inter-departmental co-operation will be adequately handled, and uneconomical overlap-ping will be avoided. In all, the activities of eighteen departments will be coveredin the Civil Histories. The Histories, when printed, are likely to run to betweenthirty and forty substantial volumes. Under present instructions, the Historiesare being written and will be printed for Government use. The question ofissuing volumes for publication has not yet been considered.14. December 1945 has been fixed as the target date for printing. Some,but not all. of the volumes will be ready by this date. If eventually it shouldbe decided to publish, it is expected that the first volumes would be ready by 1946,and the complete series within approximately three years from the end of the war.APPENDIX II.Extract from Statement made by the Prime Minister in the House ofCommons on 24th February. 1942.(Official Report : Cols. 40 and 41.)[See paragraph 41.]* *        *Let me now speak of the office, or title, which I hold as Minister of DefenceAbout this there seem to be many misunderstandings.   Perhaps the House willbear with me while I explain the method by which the war has been and will beconducted. I may say, first of all, that there is nothing which I do or have done as
Minister of Defence which I could not do as Prime Minister. As Prime Minister.I am able to deal easily and smoothly with the three Service Departments, withoutprejudice to the constitutional responsibilities of the Secretaries of State for Warand Air and the First Lord of the Admiralty. I have not, therefore, found theneed of defining formally or precisely the relationship between the office ofMinister of Defence when held by a Prime Minister and the three Service Depart-ments. I have not found it necessary to define this relationship as would benecessary in the case of any Minister of Defence who was not also Prime Minister.There is, of course, no Ministry of Defence, and the three Service Departmentsremain autonomous. For the purpose of maintaining general supervision overthe conduct of the war, which I do under the authority of the War Cabinet andthe Defence Committee, I have at my disposal a small staff, headed by Major-General Ismay, which works under the long-established procedure and machineryof the pre-war Committee of Imperial Defence and forms a part of the WarCabinet Secretariat.* * *I do not, of course, conduct this war from day to day myself; it is conductedfrom day to day, and in its future outlook, by the Chiefs&apos;of Staff Committee,namely, the First Sea Lord, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and the Chiefof the Air Staff. These officers sit together every day, and often twice a day.They give executive directions and orders to the commanders-in-chief in thevarious theatres. They advise me, they advise the Defence Committee and theWar Cabinet, on large questions of war strategy and war policy.

onTHS BRITISH CABIIffiT OPPICE.Origin of the Cabinot Office.1.    Prior to December, 1910, the BritishCabinet carried on its work without a Secretary.The order of business was managed entirely by thoPrime Minister in consultation with his colleaguesin the Cabinet.     The only record kept of CabinetMeetings was a letter from the Prime Minister tothe King.     There was no Agenda Paper; no centralsystem for ensuring that documentary materialfas prepared for the discussion of subjects;   noregular and systematic formulation of theCabinet&apos;s decisions;   no machinery for con vunicatingthose decisions to Ministers (not even to thosewho might be ahsent from a particular meeting),or for recording and co-ordinating the work ofCabinet Committees.2. In the sphere of Defence a considerabledegree of co-ordination had been achieved beforethe 7a r by the Committee of Imperial Defence, anorganisation under the Chairmanship of the Prime
Minister, which since its establishment in 1904 had &quot;beenprovided with a permanent Secretariat.     At an early-stage in the War the Secretary to the Committee ofImperial Defence became the Secretary to the War Committee.In December, 1915, the Cabinet in its old form and theWar Committee were superseded by a single body termed &quot;TheWar Cabinet&quot;, and the Secretary to the Committee ofImperial Defence then became Secretary to the War Cabinet.3. After the war, the War Cabinet disappeared and anormal Cabinet of pre-war type was re-established.    TheSecretariat was, however, retained, and, as the Cabinet i3constitutionally the historical successor of the PrivyCouncil in the sphere of executive government, theSecretary to the Cabinet was also appointed Clerkof the Council.     So the same official - a civil servantwho is also a retired combatant officer - is now Clerk ofthe Council, Secretary to the Cabinet and Secretary to theCommittee of Imperial Defence.     He is also responsiblefor the secretarial arrangements of the Economic AdvisoryCouncil.      The Secretariats of tne Cabinet and Committeeof Imperial Defence constitute a single Office under thecontrol of the Prime Minister.     The Office is borne as aseparate sub-head on tne Vote of &quot;The Treasury andSubordinate Departments&quot;.Duties of the Cabinet Secretariat.4. Under the direction of the Prime Minister, theSecretary to the Cabinet is responsible to the Cabinet forthe preparation of Agenda Papers;    the keeping of a recordof the Cabinet&apos;s decisions;    the communication of thosedecisions to Ministers, who are themselves responsiblefor taking subsequent action thereon.;   and the generalorganisation of the secretarial work of the Cabinet and
its Committees.     In the folio zing paragraphs a brief accountis given of the way in which these duties are discharged.5. The Cabinet Secretariat keeps   up to date a list ofquestions awaiting consideration by the Cabinet.     Thesequestions reach the Secretariat either directly from theCabinet itself, or are communicated to it by Cabinet Ministersor by Ministers outside the Cabinet who are Heads of Deport-ments (e.g. the Postmaster General or the Minister of Pensions).At the end of each week the Secretariat send to each CabinetMinister a list of the questions awaiting consideration, in-cluding those questions which may have been referred toCommittees, in order that Ministers may be in a position toKnow the precise state of Cabinet business at the time.Under instructions from the Prime Minister the Secretary nayinvite psrticulrr Ministers to furnish Memoranda on thesubjects awaiting consideration, but as a rale this is doneby the Ministers themselves.6. Memoranda, draft Bills, and other constituents of theCabinet agenda paper are sent to the Cabinet Secretariat forcirculation only after their subject matter has been fullyexamined between the Department from which the:/ emanate, theTreasury, the Law Officers, where contentious Bills are in-volved, and any other Departments concerned.    (See attachedTreasury Circulars of the 25th February, 19S1 and 28th April,1934).     Since 1932 it has also become usual for the Ministerconcerned before circulating a Memorandum to the Cabinet toconsult with the Prime Minister and to send him sn advancecopy.7. Subject to whst is stated in the previous paragraph,and to any instructions in regard to any particular paperwhich may be received from the Prime Minister or from the
Minister from whom the document originates, it is the dutyof the Secretary to circulate to iembers of the Cabinet copiesof all Memoranda and other documents prepared for the use ofthe Cabinet.     Subject to reference in case of doubt to thePrime Minister, or the Minister from whom a document isreceived, the Secretariat has discretion to circulate CabinetPapers ta Ministers outside the Cabinet whose Departments areaffected.     Additional copies may also be sent to Ministera attheir special request, but copies are never sent to personsother than Ministers.8.        Cabinet Meetings are held normally for general businessonoe a week, usually on Wednesday mornings, although, of course,intermediate Meetings are frequently held for the considerationof particular subjects.     A few days before the regular weeklyMeeting the Secretary obtains the Prime Minister&apos;s instructionsas to the subjects to be placed on the agenda paper for theMeeting.    It is contrary to the usual practice for the Cabinetto consider other subjects.      In cases, however, of veryexceptional urgency such subjects maybe raised with the consentof the Prime Minister, which should always be obtained priorto the actual Meeting.    The Secretary gives Ministers as longnotice as he can regarding the subjects likely to be discussed.The agenda paper contains the time and place of the Meetingand the headings of the subjects which are to be discussed.After the mention of each heading on the agenda paper areinserted a reference to the last occasion on which the Cabinetexamined the particular topic and all the relevant paperswhich have been or will, prior to the Meeting, be circulatedfor the purpose of tha discussion.9. The Secretary obtains the Prime Minister&apos;s instructionsas to summoning any Depprtmental Minister who is not a memberof the Cabinet to attend during the discussion of anyparticular subject in which that Minister or his Department
may be specially concerned.10.The Secretary attends Meetingsof the Cabinet,unless instructed to the contrary, for the purpose ofrecording the conclusions reached.11.It is the duty of the Secretary in draftingCabinet Conclusions to record only the time and place ofthe Meeting, a list of the Ministers present, and thecpnciusions reached by the Cabinet.    In the absence ofinstructions to the contrary the record is kept as short aspossible and, apart from the conclusion itself, is limitedto such explanation as is indispensable to render the con-clusion intelligible.     As a general rule it is foundsufficient to refer to any documents circulated to theCabinet before the Meeting and to such supplementary dataand information as may be given in the course of the Meeting.In exceptional cases a statement by a Minister may be re-produced and annexed to the Conclusions after approval bythe Prime Minister.      So far as practicable, however, thecustom is to avoid eny reference to opinions expressed byan individual Minister and fo li-iit the Conclusions asnarrowly as possible to the actual decision.12. As soon as possible after a Meeting a draft of theConclusions is submitted to the Prime Minister and whenapproved by him copies of the Conclusions are circulated(nearly always on the same day as the Meeting) to all Membersof the Cabinet and ons copy is sent to the King by thePrime Minister.     The Cabinet Conclusions are sealed inspecially prepared envelopes with the heading &quot;Only to beopened by the person to whom addressed&quot;.      These envelopesare then circulated in   boxes   to the Cabinet.     The Cabinetagenda is treated in similar fashion.      If any Minister wifhes
to amend the draft Conclusions he forwards his suggestionsto the Secretary, who submits them to the Prime Minister.All alterations approved by the Prime Minister are sub-sequently communicated to Cabinet Ministers by means ofoorrigenda notices.13.        Every possible precaution is taken to ensure secrecy,and in the reproduction of the Cabinet Conclusions only aminimum staff is employed.14. The duty of the Secretary to the Cabinet ends afterhe has communicated the Conclusions to the Members of theCabinet.    Ministers themselves are responsible for makingsuch communication as they may deem necessary to theirrespective Departments in regard to ths Conclusions of theCabinet.15. After a Meeting of the Cabinet, a list of theMinisters present is prepared by the Secretary and issued tothe Press through the regular channels of communication.There is no contact of any kind or description between theCabinet Secretariat and the Press.16. The Cabinet Conclusions are indexed by the Secretf ry&apos;sPrivate Secretary, who keeps the index up to date after eachmeeting.17. The Cabinet Secretariat is responsible for insuringthat all documents, required for the use of the Cabinet andits Committees, ere produced in proper form, and arecirculated to all the persons concerned.     The document  inquestion,   which may be either in printed or typed form, aresometimes reproduced by the Secretariat itself, or, mereusually and indeed wherever practicable, by the Departmentof the Minister with when the document originates.     Whena Minister wishes to circulate a Memorandum to the Cabinet
or to a Cabinet Committee, his Private Secretary communicateswith the Cabinet Secretariat and ascertains the Cabinetserial number to be   placed on the document.     He thenforwards to the Secretariat the requisite number of copiesof the document at least 5 days before the meeting of theCabinet at wnicn it is to be consiuered.18.     On receiving the copies of the oocument, the CabinetSecretariat, after verifying that the conditions ofcirculation have been complied with, e.g. those inparagraph 6 above, distribute them to the Cabinet andother ministers who may be concerned in the ^articularbusiness.     On the average this distribution of papersfrom the Cabinet Office takes place twice a day, butadditional distributions are often made in cases ofemergency.     This distribution of oocuments is made bymeans of   boxes, of which each Cabinet Minister and hisPrivate Secretary possesses a key.     bach copy of everydocument is numbered and a record is kept of the person towhom each copy is charged.19.     The Cabinet Office is not an Intelligence Department.Per information and advice on any particular subject, theCabinet and its Committees must always look to the Departmentor Departments concerned.Cabinet Committees.20.     Apart from the Committee of Imperial Defence,mention may be made of anotner standing Committeeof the Cabinet, namely, the Committee of Home Affairs.This- Committee was established by the ^ar Cabinet in July,1918.     The Committee is an advisory body, and itsconclusions and recommendations are submitted to the Cabinetfor approval before action is taken upon them.     Theseconclusions and recommendations are embodied in the printed
Minutes of the Committee, which are circulated to allMembers of the Cabinet as well as to the Members of theCommittee.     In due course the recommendations areplaced on the Cabinet agenda, and each of them forms thesubject of a separate Cabinet Conclusion.21,    Since 1924, the principal function of this Committeehas been to examine Government Bills,particularly fromthe legal point of view, and to make recommendations tothe Cabinet on drafting and other questions of detail,reserving however all major questions of policy forCabinet decision.     Another very useful function of theCommittee is the consideration, at the commencement ofeach Session, of the Government&apos;s Legislative programmein relation to the Parliamentary time available, and theCommittee is able to make suggestions to the Cabinet asto wnich items in the legislation suggested by theDepartmental Ministers should be expedited, deferred orabandoned.22.    In addition to the standing Committees, it has alwaysbeen the practice of the Cabinet to appoint ad hocCommittees for the examination of particular questions.The composition and terms of reference of these Committeesare as a rule settled by the Cabinet itself, and theReports of the Committees come before the Cabinet forconsideration and decision in the same way as otherdocuments.     The Cabinet Secretariat are responsible forthe circulation of Cabinet Committee papers, for thearrangement of meetings of the Committees, and for thedrafting of Reports and other similar documents.     In caseswhere prolonged investigation of technical subjects isrequired, it is usual to invite the Department mainlyconcerned to allow one of its officers, expert in the
24. The establishment wor*c of the Office as a wholeis entrusted to an Assistant Secretary (a permanent civilservant) who also assists with the wom of the Sub-Committees of the Committee of Imperial Defence end who,like the Private Secretary to the Secretary to the Cabinet,serves both the Cabinet and the Committee of Imperial Defence.25. The clerical, manipulative and messenger staffs ofthe Office serve the needs of the Secretariat of theCabinet, Committee of Imperial Defence and Econo-nic AdvisoryCouncil, and are in the main pooled for that purpose.     Atthe present time this subordinate staff numbers in all 70persons of whom 25 are clericals, 25 shorthand writers andtypists, and 20 messengers.Occasional Duties of the Cabinet Office.26. The Cabinet Office has in the past often beenasked to co-operate with other Departments in providing theSecretariats of International Conferences end ImperialConferences.    The procedure explained above is easilyadaptable to this purpose, and such co-operation hasinvariably been attended by smooth working between theCabinet Office and the other Departments concerned.Remarks.27. The function of the Cabinet Office is essentiallyone of the machinery of Government and not of policy.     Itcannot be too strongly emphasised that the Cabinet Secret-ariat has no duty of offering advice in any matter ofpolicy or of interfering in any way with the functions ofresponsible Departments in this respect.     Any interferenceof this kind would at once cause friction and render thework if the Cabinet Office a hindrance instead of a help.R.B.H.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.June 29th, 1936.
subject natter, to ect as a Secretary of the CabinetCommittee jointly with a member of the Cabinet Secretariat.The administration arrangements and procedure of CabinetCommittees approximate closely to those of the Cabinet asdescribed above.Organicetion of the Office.23.   It has be en already explained that the present holder ofthe post of Secretary to the Cabinet is also Clerk of theCouncil and Secretary to the Committee of Imperial Defence.The Deputy Secretary to the Cabinet acts for the Secretaryin the latter&apos;s absence in all matters relating to the workof the Cabinet, end is also Secretary of the Hone AffairsCommittee and of the ad hoc Cabinet Committees.    The onlyother administrative officer in the Cabinet Secretariat,whose duties are concerned exclusively with Cabinet work,is the Tressury Principal who acts as liaison officer withthe Treasury and assists the Deputy Secretary with theCabinet Committee wor^c and generally with the routine woricof the Office.     It would be beyond the scope of the presennote to describe the work of the Committee of ImperialDefence end of the Economic Advisory Council, and for presenpurposes it is sufficient to mention that the adninistrativstaff of the Committee of Imperial Defence is composed ofserving officers in His Majesty&apos;s Forces nominatedrespectively by the First Lord of the Admiralty,  theSecretary of State for War, the Secretary of State for Airand the Secretary of State for India.      The senior of theseofficers is the Deputy Secretary to the Committee cfImperial Defence and acts for the Secretary in the latter&apos;sabsence in all matters relating to that Committee.     TheOffice is not in water-tight compartments and officers ofthe Committee of Imperial Defence are sometimes calledupon to assist with the work of the Cabinet Committees,particularly if the latter deal with defence and similarquestions.
No. 11/24.COPY OF TREASURY CIRCULAR, 28TH APRIL, 1924.Sir,I am directed by the Lords Commissioners of H.M. Treasury to acquaintyou, for the information ofthat H. M. Government have had under careful consideration the question ofinsuring that the Cabinet and Cabinet Committees-shall be invited to reachdecisions only after the subject referred to the Cabinet has been thoroughly examinedbetween each of the various Public Departments concerned.This elementary rule of business is essential if the Cabinet and its Committeesare to have available all the facts and points of view requisite for an enlighteneddecision and are to be saved the possibility of hasty or uninformed conclusions.The observance of the rule is the more obligatory under modern conditionswhen the mass of Government business has so enormously increased, and as aconsequence Governments can only get through it efficiently if the issues presentedfor decision have been carefully investigated beforehand by the Departments incollaboration.The Cabinet feels sure that Departments are anxious to assist it in securingthe observance of this rule, and has come to the conclusion that the desired objectwill be facilitated by the following procedure. In future all memoranda, draftBills and other constituents of the Agenda will be sent to the Cabinet Secretariatfor circulation only after their subject-matter has been fully examined betweenthe Departments from which they emanate, the Treasury, the Law Officers wherecontentious Bills are involved, and any other Department concerned, and thesedocuments will bear on the face of them a specific statement that this examinationhas taken place. The documents should be made as complete as possible bycontaining the various arguments and criticisms which might be brought againstthe proposals advocated. To enable the members of the Cabinet (and CabinetCommittees) to have time to consider proposals intended for Cabinet decisionand in view also of the possibility that such inter-Departmental examination mayresult in definite differences of opinion necessitating the preparation of memorandaby the dissenting Department or Departments, no memoranda, draft Bills, etc.,which originate proposals for Cabinet decision will be placed on the Agenda untilan interval of at least five days has elapsed after circulation, except on anyoccasion when the Prime Minister expressly authorises a relaxation of the rule.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,N.

THE MACHINERY OF THE COMMITTEEOF IMPERIAL DEFENCE

THE MACHINERY OF THE COMMITTEE OFIMPERIAL DEFENCEBy Major-General H. L. Ismay, C.B., D.S.O., Secretary of theCommittee of Imperial Defence.On Wednesday, January nth, 1939, at 3 p.m.The Right Hon. Sir Thomas Inskip, Kt., C.B.E., M.P., in the Chair.The Chairman, in introducing the Lecturer, said : General Ismay hasqualifications which hardly anyone else possesses for speaking about the Committeeof Imperial Defence. He served for some years as Assistant Secretary of theCommittee under Sir Maurice Hankey (now Lord Hankey), and, after returningto purely military duties, he has now succeeded Lord Hankey as the Secretaryof the Committee.The importance of the Committee of Imperial Defence is manifest to everybody.I am not aware that there is to be found in any place an accurate and authoritativestatement about that organization, and it is a great advantage to us and will be,I hope, to many others connected with the Royal United Service Institution thatthere should be a statement to which reference may be made by all those whodesire to become better acquainted with our organization of defence.LECTUREAFEW months ago the Secretary of the Royal United ServiceInstitution told me that he was constantly receiving requests,especially from officers serving abroad, for literature on the subjectof the composition and working of the Committee of Imperial Defence,and that he could only reply that there was nothing official publishedabout it. In conveying an invitation to me to give this lecture, hesaid that the Council of the Institution fully appreciated that I couldnot talk about current controversies, but that they hoped it might atleast be possible for me to give a description of the machinery of the
Committee of Imperial Defence, which could be published in the Journalfor the benefit of those who had not had the opportunity of informingthemselves on the subject. With the permission of our Chairman thisafternoon I readily accepted this invitation.I appreciate, of course, that a lecture framed on such elementarylines and of such limited scope will be profoundly uninteresting to thoseof my audience-and they probably represent a large majority-whoare already familiar with the subject, and came here this afternoonhoping to hear something rather different. I can only crave theirindulgence, and ask them to assist in the object which the Council ofthe Institution have in mind by commenting during the Discussionwhich will follow on any points which I may have omitted or which Imay have failed to make clear.HISTORICAL.I do not want to spend too much time on past history, but it wouldbe difficult to present a clear picture of the present machinery of theCommittee of Imperial Defence without explaining its origin andsubsequent development.Pre-War PeriodIts origin came about in this way. After the South African Wara Committee was set up under the Chairmanship of Lord Esher toconsider the reconstitution of the War Office. This Committee, in thecourse of their first report, drew attention to a grave defect in ourgeneral defensive arrangements.   This is what they said : &quot; The British Empire is pre-eminently a great naval, Indian andColonial Power.   There are, nevertheless, no means for co-ordinatingdefence problems, or for dealing with them as a whole......We aredriven to the conclusion that no measure of War Office reform willavail, unless it is associated with provision for obtaining and co-ordinating for the use of the Cabinet all the information and the expertadvice required for the shaping of national policy in war, and fordetermining the necessary preparations in peace. Such information andadvice must necessarily embrace not only the sphere of the War Officebut also the spheres of the Admiralty and of other offices of State.&quot;In a word, there was no recognised machinery for co-ordinating defencequestions ; and such machinery was badly needed.The remedy proposed by the Committee was the creation of aCommittee of Imperial Defence. The Prime Minister was to be its&quot; invariable President,&quot; with &quot; absolute discretion in the selection orvariation of its members &quot; ; and there was to be a small permanentsecretariat, which would, among other things, provide continuity.
The Government of the day accepted this recommendation, and theCommittee of Imperial Defence was formally brought into being inMay, 1904. The Secretariat was established in Mr. Disraelfs old housein Whitehall Gardens. These attractive old buildings have, alas, nowbeen pulled down, and the Secretariat is housed in Richmond Terrace.I only mention this detail, because, to judge from envelopes that havefound their way to me, some people appear to think that the Committeeof Imperial Defence is an appendage of the \Yar Office, others that itis an appendage of the Treasury, others that it works at 10, DowningStreet; whereas it is, of course, an entirely separate entity.The Committee of Imperial Defence has always had two characteristicswhich are so fundamental to its whole conception that they should beexplained at once. The first is that it has no executive authoritywhatsoever. It only co-ordinates and gives advice. Of course it goeswithout saying that the advice of a body which has the Prime Ministeras its Chairman and whose meetings are regularly attended by manyother Cabinet Ministers and the professional heads of the four CrownServices is generally accepted. But that does not alter the con-stitutional position which, strictly speaking, is that the Committee ofImperial Defence advises on defence questions; the Cabinet decides ;and the Department or Departments concerned take the necessaryexecutive action. This does not mean, of course, that it is necessaryfor every question on which the Committee of Imperial Defence is askedto advise to go subsequently to the Cabinet. Far from it. In themajority I should say ninety-five per cent. of cases, the agreedrecommendations of the Committee of Imperial Defence are automaticallyimplemented by the Departments concerned on the responsibility andauthority of their respective Ministers. If, however, a matter is one forwhich the Cabinet as a whole should take collective responsibility, therecommendations of the Committee of Imperial Defence are placed beforethem for decision before executive action is taken.May I illustrate the latter category by an imaginary example. Letus suppose that the situation demands the despatch of military forces and I use the word &quot; military &quot; in its widest sense to some threatenedpoint abroad. In that event the Committee of Imperial Defence considerall the factors which have a bearing on the problem political, military,economic and so forth. Having reached agreement, it puts forwardrecommendations to the Cabinet as to the precise naval, military andair forces which should be sent, the dates on which they should start,the route by which they should go, the action that they should take onarrival, the diplomatic action that should be taken in parallel, and soforth.   In other words, it submits to the Cabinet a comprehensive plan
of action. The Cabinet then takes its decision in the light of this advice.Thereafter the Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry issue the necessaryorders to the naval, military and air force commanders concerned; theForeign Office takes such diplomatic action as is involved; and theBoard of Trade takes up the necessary shipping, and so forth.It is difficult to see how any other arrangement would work underour present Constitution. The decision on all major questions, whetherof defence or anything else, must clearly rest with the Cabinet as theexecutive organ of Government responsible to Parliament; and theCabinet clearly could not share their authority with the Committee ofImperial Defence or anybody else. Again, every Minister of the Crownwho is in charge of a Department of State is directly responsible toParliament and the country for the whole business of that Department.If the Committee of Imperial Defence were to start issuing orders, sayto naval Commanders-in-Chief as regards the movement of ships, or tolocal authorities as regards air raid precautions measures, the positionof the First Lord of the Admiralty and of the Lord Privy Seal as theMinister responsible for Civil Defence, would be impossible. It may besuggested that this system is slow. To that I would reply that themachine is very flexible, and that all the processes which I havedescribed can, if necessary, be put through in a very short time. Forexample, I have myself known a case in which orders for considerabletroop movements and for all the ancillary arrangements on which suchmovements depend were issued within four hours of the machinery ofthe Committee of Imperial Defence being brought into play. I amreferring to an isolated incident under peace conditions. War conditionsare, of course, a different story, and later in my lecture I will explainthe modifications in the system which were made during the Great Warin order to combine rapid executive action with the maintenance ofCabinet control and responsibility. For the moment the point that Iwish to emphasise as fundamental is that the Committee of ImperialDefence, by reason of the fact that it has no executive authority, is nota super-department and that it in no way modifies or limits Parliamentarycontrol or Ministerial responsibility. Had it done either of these things,it would probably have perished long ago.The second fundamental characteristic of the Committee of ImperialDefence is its elasticity. The Esher Committee deliberately avoidedlaying down any fixed composition, and stipulated that the PrimeMinister should have absolute discretion as to the selection and variationof its members. He can invite whoever he likes. The result is that theindividual and collective experience of every British citizen, irrespectiveof whether he, or she, is inside or outside Government circles, andirrespective of profession or political party, is available to the Committee
of Imperial Defence organization, provided, of course, that he or she iswilling to accept the invitation to serve. I shall explain later on howthis works out in practice.After this somewhat lengthy, but I think necessary, digression, I willtry to describe the activities of the Committee of Imperial Defence fromthe date of its birth up to the outbreak of the Great War. Broadlyspeaking, these fall into two categories.In the first place, they hammered out the great fundamentalprinciples that should govern Imperial Defence in regard to such mattersas the respective roles of the Navy and Army; the defence of theBritish Isles against seaborne attack (in those days this was the onlyform of attack that was possible) ; the defence of India ; coast defencethroughout the Empire and so forth.The second broad category of the Committee&apos;s work was an exhaustivesurvey of the possibilities and demands of a great war, and the preparationof detailed plans which would ensure that all authorities, both at homeand abroad, should work to a pre-arranged and closely co-ordinatedprogramme from the outset. These plans covered a very wide field,e.g., plans for controlling the movements of merchant shipping ; plansfor postal, telegraphic and press censorship throughout the Empire ;plans against sabotage at home and abroad; and so forth. The planswere, as a general rule, prepared by Sub-Committees of appropriateconstitution ; after approval by the Committee of Imperial Defence, theywere entered in the War Book. The Dominions, India and the Colonieswere kept informed of these arrangements, and made their own plansaccordingly.The War PeriodIn 1914, ten years after the Committee&apos;s birth, the storm broke.Mr. Lloyd George in the first volume of his War Memories, pays aremarkable tribute to the manner in which the work that had been doneby the Committee of Imperial Defence stood up to this supreme test.This is his description of the events of the first few days : &quot; Measures which conferred unheard-of powers on the Executivewere passed through both houses of Parliament after a few hoursdiscussion. Most of them had been carefully thought out duringthe tranquil years of peace by the numerous Sub-Committees ofthe Committee of Imperial Defence. Of what was accomplishedby that remarkable body in the years before the War and of itsforesight nothing has yet been mentioned. Its founder EarlBalfour when he set up the Committee of Imperial Defence asan essential part of the organization of defence, rendered a service
to his country which deserves immortality. Under Mr. Asquithit carried on its tasks and traditions with undiminished vigour andpersistance. It, therefore, came to pass that when war was thrustupon us, plans which played a vital part in our achievement ofvictory lay at hand . . . prepared to the last detail, and readyto be put into execution.&quot;For the first few weeks of war, the Committee of Imperial Defencecarried on on pre-war lines ; but it was soon found that delays andconfusion resulted from a system which required every recommendationof the Committee to be approved by the Cabinet as a whole before itcould become effective. Mr. Asquith realised these shortcomings ; but,in his anxiety to preserve collective Cabinet responsibility, he corn-promised by setting up a War Council. This body absorbed the functionsof the Committee of Imperial Defence, which it closely resembled ; butunlike the Committee of Imperial Defence it had a measure of executiveauthority on questions of detail. On questions of major policy, theCabinet kept the conduct of the War in its own hands. Subsequently,a body known as the &quot; War Committee &quot; was substituted for the WarCouncil.   But the change was one of name rather than substance.When Mr. Lloyd George became Prime Minister there was a verydrastic change. The functions of the Cabinet and the War Committeewere combined in a smaller body known as the &quot; War Cabinet,&quot; whichconsisted of the Prime Minister himself and five other Ministers, none ofwhom, with the exception of Mr. Bonar Law, held a portfolio. Theywere thus able to devote their whole time to the conduct of the Warwithout the distractions of Departmental administration. The WarCabinet had full powers of decision ; but, apart from this, the distinctivefeatures of the Committee of Imperial Defence were carried on : the sameclose association with the Chiefs of Staff; the same extensive use ofSub-Committees there were over two hundred of them when the warended ; the same Secretariat only larger ; the same secretarial methods.In other words the machinery of the Committee of Imperial Defence wasthroughout the War adapted to war needs.The War Cabinet system survived until the end of the War ; andthere is good reason to believe that none of the other belligerents evolvedanything better. For example, General Ludendorf tells us in hisMemoirs &quot; that the machinery of Government in Berlin gave theimpression of being extremely clumsy. The various Departments workedside by side without any real cohesion, and there was infinite overlapping.The left hand did not know what the right hand was doing.&quot;As to the future, the crux of the whole problem of the higher directionof war is to devise a system which will combine rapid and effective
executive action with the maintenance of Cabinet responsibility andcontrol. It is clear that the system will vary according to the characterand scope of the conflict. For example, to take an extreme case, itwould be absurd to unsettle the ordinary peace-time machinery ofGovernment in order to conduct a war with a &quot; Mad Mullah &quot; of Somali-land. At the other end of the scale, it might so happen that nothingshort of a small War Cabinet of the kind which was set up in 1917 couldproperly direct the national effort in a war which called for themobilization of the entire national resources. The precise system to beadopted cannot be settled in advance of the event; it must be decidedby the Prime Minister and Cabinet of the day in the light of the thenexisting circumstances. But whatever the decision on this point, it seemstolerably certain that the organ of supreme control, whatever form itmay assume whether it be War Council or small War Cabinet wouldtake over the machinery of the Committee of Imperial Defence and thatthe transition from the peace system would be smooth, simple andpractically instantaneous.Post War PeriodIn November, 1919, the WTar Cabinet was replaced by a Cabinet ofnormal size, and the Committee of Imperial Defence reverted to a peacefooting under its maiden name. They found themselves confronted witha far wider range and a far greater variety of problems than had fallento the lot of their predecessors. In pre-War days, war was generallyregarded as the almost exclusive business of the fighting Services ; andthere were only two of them. The post-War situation was a very differentone. The creation of a third Service the Royal Air Force had madethe business of co-ordination at once more essential and more complicated.Again, the Great War had shown that modern war between SovereignPowers is an affair of whole nations, and that it demands the mobilizationof the entire national resources human, material, industrial and economic.It showed, in fact, that the fighting Services are merely the cutting edgeof a defensive mechanism which includes every single Department ofState and all the national energies which those Departments control ordirect. This meant for the post-War Committee of Imperial Defencethat the field of defensive preparation had got to be almost immeasurablyextended, and that all the civil Departments of State had got to be muchmore intimately associated with defensive preparations than had beennecessary in pre-War days. Thirdly, aviation had robbed these islandsof many of the advantages of their insularity. This meant that in theirdefensive preparations the Committee of Imperial Defence could no longerbank on the time margin for developing the immense resources of theEmpire that was vouchsafed to their predecessors.
They proceeded to adapt and develop the machinery so as to dealwith these new responsibilities ; and this process of adaptation anddevelopment has gone steadily forward ever since. In the time at mydisposal, I cannot enter into details, but two important developmentsmust be specially mentioned : First, in 1923, the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee was brought intobeing.   I shall refer to this later.Secondly, in 1936, the office of Minister for Co-ordination of Defencewas created. The following are some of the duties which the PrimeMinister has delegated to this Minister (I quote from the White Paperrelating to Defence of 3rd March, 1936) : (1) The general day-to-day supervision and control on the PrimeMinisters behalf of the whole organization and activity of theCommittee of Imperial Defence. . . . The discernment of anypoints which either have not been taken up or are beingpursued too slowly, and (in consultation with the Prime Ministeror other Ministers or Committees as required) of appropriatemeasures for their rectification.(2)  In the Prime Ministers absence, taking the Chair at theCommittee of Imperial Defence. . . .(3)  Personal consultation with the Chiefs of Staff together,including the right to convene under his Chairmanship theChiefs of Staff Committee whenever he,  or they, thinkdesirable.(4)  The Chairmanship of the Principal Supply Officers Committee.In addition, the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence is responsiblefor making such recommendations as he thinks necessary for improvingthe organization of the Committee of Imperial Defence.THE PRESENT MACHINERY.This brings me to the present situation.The first point that I would emphasise is that, notwithstanding thedevelopments that I have mentioned, the fundamental principles of theCommittee of Imperial Defence are precisely the same as they were whenit was first conceived : it is still purely advisory ; it is still almostinfinitely elastic ; the Prime Minister is still its invariable President ; hestill has absolute discretion as to the selection and variation of itsmembers ; and there is still a small though admittedly not quite sosmall permanent Secretariat.The Permanent PanelFor some years past, it has been the practice for successive PrimeMinisters on assuming Office to nominate the Ministers and officials whom
they wish to serve on what may be called the Permanent Panel of theCommittee of Imperial Defence, and to attend all its meetings withoutinvitation. The present Permanent Panel of the Committee is as follows:-The Prime Minister (Chairman).Minister for Co-ordination of Defence (Deputy Chairman).Chancellor of the Exchequer.Home Secretary.Lord Privy Seal.Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.Secretary of State for the Colonies.Secretary of State for India and Secretary of State for Burma.First Lord of the Admiralty.Secretary of State for War.Secretary of State for Air.First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff.Chief of the Imperial General Staff.Chief of the Air Staff.Permanent Secretary to the Treasury.Secretary to the Cabinet.The self-governing Dominions are not represented on the PermanentPanel, but certain of the Dominion High Commissioners in Londonregularly attend those meetings at which matters of interest to theirGovernments are down for discussion.In addition to the Permanent Panel, other Ministers, other officersof the Crown Services, and experts of every kind administrators,industrialists, scientists, and so forth are invited to attend meetingswhen the problems under consideration call for their particular experience.Organization-CabinetIICommittee of Imperial DefenceIStrategyandPlanningSub-CommitteesOrganizationfor WarSub-CommitteesMan-PowerSub-CommitteesSupplySub-CommitteesMiscellaneous(includingResearch andExperiment)Sub-Committees
The organization of the Committee of Imperial Defence and thesystem on which it works is illustrated in the foregoing table. Inprinciple, it is precisely the same as it was in the beginning ; that is tosay the detailed work is entrusted to a large number of Sub-Committeesof appropriate constitution, while the Main Committee itself lays downthe broad lines of policy, and acts as a sort of clamping machine andclearing house, and, if necessary, a court of appeal. The analogy thatI would give you is that the Committee of Imperial Defence itself is thearchitect and at the same time the master-builder, engaged in directingand supervising the erection of the gigantic edifice of Imperial Defence ;the actual construction and equipment of the building being entrustedto a host of sub-contractors, each of them an expert in his own particularline of business and each of them able to draw upon the most skilledlabour available in the country. Lest this analogy should be thoughtsmugly complacent, it should be added that even the best constructedbuildings develop defects, and that however good their initial equipment,renovations and innovations are necessary if they are not to fall behindthe times. So it is with the structure of Imperial Defence. It is thebusiness of the Committee of Imperial Defence in general, and of theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence in particular, to discern any suchshortcomings in the building and to take the proper measures for theirrectification.The Sub-Committees are shown in groups rather than individuallyfor the sake of clarity. To set out the whole family tree in detail wouldmake a very confusing diagram. Most of them are permanent or StandingSub-Committees; some of them indeed date from pre-War days.Others are appointed ad hoc to deal with problems which are notaltogether appropriate to any of the Standing Sub-Committees. Theseare generally dissolved when they have completed their tasks.Before entering into details, may I make two general observations.I have said that the Committee of Imperial Defence is almost infinitelyelastic. May I support this by some statistics ? In the twelve monthswhich ended on the 31st December last, there were 409 meetings of theCommittee and its Sub-Committees. These were attended in theaggregate by 876 different persons many of whom of course served onseveral of the Sub-Committees. These figures include 35 Ministers, 297officers of the fighting Sendees, 473 Civil Servants, 14 Ministers andofficials from the Dominions, and 57 persons outside the GovernmentService. The scope of the Committee&apos;s work must therefore be measuredby the co-ordinated activities of nearly 900 persons, many of them withlarge staffs of their own, each of them within his own sphere making somecontribution to the common cause.
My second general observation is this. The term &quot; Committee &quot; isperhaps an unfortunate one because it is associated in the minds of somepeople with discussion rather than decision. But what is the alternative ?The problems of defence are so many and so varied that no single man,and indeed no fixed body of men, however numerous or however wellinformed, can of themselves possess the knowledge to arrive at correctdecisions, unless they are provided with expert advice on the variousaspects of each particular problem. Such advice can only be obtainedby assembling the team most appropriate to each case. This practiceof delegation to experts is, I imagine, common to all big organizations,such for example as the London County Council, but the Committee ofImperial Defence is in the exceptionally fortunate position of having analmost unlimited field of talent from which to select their teams, orsyndicates, or whatever you may like to call them. But I deliberatelyuse the word &apos; team,&apos; because it so aptly describes the spirit in whichas a general rule these Sub-Committees work. In effect, though not inname, they constitute an immense and infinitely elastic, combined defencestaff.I now turn to a brief explanation of how some of these Sub-Committeesare composed and what their work is.Strategical and Planning GroupTaking the Strategical and Planning Group first, the most importantis, of course, the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee. The Prime Minister isthe Chairman and presides over occasional meetings. In addition, theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence has the right to convene theSub-Committee under his Chairmanship whenever he or they may thinkdesirable.   Normally, however, the three Chiefs of Staff meet alone.The responsibilities of the Sub-Committee are summarised in thefollowing instructions which are issued to each Chief of Staff on assumingoffice, in the form of a warrant signed by the Prime Minister: &quot; In addition to the functions of the Chiefs of Staff as adviserson questions of sea, land or air policy respectively to their ownBoard or Council, each of the three Chiefs of Staff will have anindividual and collective responsibility for advising on defencepolicy as a whole, the three constituting as it were, a Super-Chiefsof a War Staff in Commission.&quot;In accordance with these instructions, the Chiefs of Staff direct andsupervise the preparation of all military plans.   In addition, they arecalled upon to give advice on the current defence problems which cropup from day to day.   A week seldom passes without a Chiefs of Staffmeeting; and on occasions they are in almost daily session.
The Chiefs of Staff have a number of Sub-Committees working underthem. There is, for example, a Joint Planning Sub-Committee whichconsists of the Director of Plans at the Admiralty and the DeputyDirectors of Operations at the War Office and Air Ministry. Theirbusiness is to prepare combined plans in accordance with the instructionsgiven to them by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee and generally toserve that Committee in the role of a combined Staff.In 1936 there was an important development. The Joint PlanningSub-Committee was reinforced by three officers drawn respectively fromthe Navy, Army, and Air Force, a condition of their appointment beingthat they are graduates of the Imperial Defence College. These assistantshave a common room in the Committee of Imperial Defence building, inaddition to their rooms in their own departments. They are thus enabledto work in close and continuous collaboration with each other, and atthe same time to maintain close contact with their own Departments andparticularly with their own Departmental Chiefs from whom, and fromwhom alone, they take their orders. They work whole-time on combinedplanning, and the result of this reinforcement has been a considerableacceleration of business.The Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee consists of the Deputy Directorsof Intelligence at the Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry, reinforcedas necessary by representatives of the Foreign Office, the Department ofOverseas Trade and other Departments. This Sub-Committee providesthe Chiefs of Staff and Joint Planning Committee with co-ordinatedintelligence in respect of any problem which they may be examining.Organization for War GroupI now turn to the Organization for War Group, which includes alarge number of Sub-Committees.   I can, of course, mention only a fewof them.There is an Oversea Defence Committee which has been in existencefor nearly fifty years. It has the Permanent Under Secretary of Statefor the Colonies as Chairman and its membership includes appropriaterepresentatives from the Admiralty, War Office, Air Ministry, IndiaOffice, Burma Office, Dominions Office, Foreign Office, and Treasury. Itsbusiness, broadly speaking, is to advise on all questions relating to thedefence of oversea Colonies, Protectorates, Dependencies and MandatedTerritories, other than technical questions of coast defence which aredealt with by the Joint Oversea and Home Defence Committee.The Civil Defence (Policy) Sub-Committee, and the (Technical) Sub-Committee which works under it, have recently been created as theresult of the reorganization that was rendered necessary by the appoint-
ment of the Lord Privy Seal as Minister for Civil Defence. The Chairmanof the Civil Defence (Policy) Sub-Committee is the Lord Privy Seal.The members are the Secretaries of State for the Home Department andScotland, the Presidents of the Board of Trade and Education, theMinisters of Health, Labour and Transport, and the Postmaster-General.These Committees are responsible, under the Committee of ImperialDefence, for reviewing the planning and organization by the Departmentsconcerned, of all civil defence measures, including National VoluntaryService, and for their co-ordination. May I ask you particularly to notethat these Committees function under the Committee of Imperial Defence.The problems of &quot; military &quot; defence and &quot; civil &quot; defence are closelyinterlaced, and it is essential that they should be brought together ina single focus so as to ensure that they are framed on the same basis andfit into one another.   In fact, defence is indivisible.Other Committees of this group are the Home Defence Committee,whose functions are implicit in its name ; and the Joint Oversea andHome Defence Committee, whose particular business is the defence ofports both at home and abroad.Then there is a Standing Inter-departmental Committee on Censorship,whose membership includes, in addition to representatives of all theDepartments concerned, the officers who have been designated for thehigher censorship posts in time of war. It will be appreciated, of course,that this Committee deals solely with plans for a war emergency, sincethere is no censorship of any kind in time of peace. The Committeeitself lays down the general principles to be followed, and a small draftingCommittee produces the necessary regulations and instructions. Theseare issued to all concerned in time of peace, in order to ensure that, inthe event of war, it would be possible to enforce Postal, Telegraphic andPress Censorship from the outset.Then there is a War Emergency Legislation Sub-Committee, which isresponsible for considering what special powers it would be necessaryfor the Executive to have in time of war and for seeing that the necessarylegislation is drafted in peace and ready to be placed before Parliamentat the outset of hostilities.Man Power GroupI will not deal in detail with the Man Power Group as it is in processof revision owing to the changes necessitated by the appointment of theLord Privy Seal as Minister in charge of Civil Defence. Broadly speaking,however, its task is to review the various policies which could be adoptedin the event of war to ensure that the man power of the nation is utilisedto the best advantage and to prepare alternative schemes which will
obviate the repetition of those costly mistakes in the allocation of manpower which were made at the beginning of the Great War.Supply GroupTurning now to the Supply Group, the main Committees are thePrincipal Supply Officers Committee, the Food Supply Committee andthe Oil Board.The Principal Supply Officers Committee has a vast organizationworking under it, which has recently been fully explained in Parliament.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence is Chairman, and its membershipincludes the Supply members of the Board of Admiralty and Army andAir Councils together with the Permanent Secretary of the Board ofTrade, the Secretary, Ministry of Labour, the Secretary of the Departmentof Scientific and Industrial Research, the Adviser on Supply questions tothe Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, and a Representative of theTreasury. In addition, the Offices of the High Commissioners for certainDominions are represented by Associate Members.The task of the Principal Supply Officers Committee is, broadlyspeaking, to foresee, and make provision for, the whole of the nation&apos;srequirements in time of war as regards both raw materials and manu-facturing capacity. I might mention by way of example that it wasthis Committee which, by exhaustive enquiries, was able to identify thosematerials which would present difficulty in time of war, to estimate theprobable extent of the gap in each case, and thus to advise as to theprecise quantities of each of them that should be accumulated in time ofpeace, and held in reserve.Miscellaneous GroupThe Miscellaneous Group includes those Sub-Committees which areengaged in problems of experiment and research, and for obvious reasonsI cannot go into details in a public lecture. I ought, however, to mentionthat the eminent scientists who are included in their membership devotethemselves unstintingly to the service of these Sub-Committees.SecretariatThe Secretariat of the Committee of Imperial Defence at presentconsists of one Secretary and eight Assistant Secretaries. Two of theseare Civil Servants ; the remainder are officers seconded from the fightingServices for periods of three to four years.The Secretariat are not, as is sometimes imagined, advisers to theCommittee of Imperial Defence. Their duties are secretarial; that isto say they arrange the business of the Committee of Imperial Defenceand its numerous progeny of Sub-Committees ; they record meetings,and draft the necessary reports and plans.
CONCLUSIONI have tried to explain the conception underlying the creation of theCommittee of Imperial Defence, how it worked before the War, and howits machinery was used during the War. I have tried to explain howthat machinery has been developed to meet the altered circumstancesof the present day. My lecture will have been unworthy of its subjectif I have failed to show you that the Committee of Imperial Defence isa living and progressive organism which, while preserving its fundamentalcharacteristics, can be adopted and developed to meet any demandswhich future changes in the situation may make upon it.DISCUSSIONMajor-General Huddleston : The Lecturer spoke of the Sub-Committeeson Civil Defence and told us what their composition was, but I do not think hestated that there were any members of the fighting Services on those Committees.If that is the case, I should like to ask the Lecturer why it is so.The Lecturer : All three fighting Services are represented on the Civil DefenceTechnical Sub-Committee.Captain E. Altham, R.N. : The Lecturer kindly suggested that I might recallto you one or two historical episodes which would emphasise the great developmentsthat have taken place in the Committee of Imperial Defence since the years beforeand during the Great War.For example, there was the extraordinary condition of affairs which prevailedat the time of the Agadir crisis in 1911. On the 23rd August of that year, in viewof the strained situation, a special Committee was called and two Wilsons (one,who afterwards became Field Marshal Sir Henry Wilson, representing the WarOffice ; the other being that distinguished First Sea Lord, Sir Arthur Wilson)propounded two absolutely different, if not diametrically opposed, plans for war.In the year 1914, on the 5th August, what is described by Mr. Churchill in hisThe World Crisis Vol. 1, as an Extraordinary Council of War, met, and, to usehis own words (he was a Cabinet Minister then) &quot; a decision was required uponthe question, how should we wage the war that had just begun.&quot; Such animportant decision as whether we should send four or six divisions to the Continenthad not been taken, the problem of where the Army was to land and the questionof whether we should retain a defending force of one or two divisions in Englandwere still under discussion on the day after war broke out.It is true that plans had been drawn up to meet such eventualities, andit was certainly not the fault of the Committee of Imperial Defence that decisionshad not been come to sooner. It was quite an efficient piece of machinery evenin those days ; but there was no Chiefs of Staff Committee and there was no JointPlanning Committee. Those vital parts of the machinery, which have now beenprovided, were missing, and we saw the dire results in the hopeless muddle ofthe planning and execution of the Dardanelles campaign. A Joint PlanningCommittee to do the staff work for a Chiefs of Staff Committee would have savedus one of the most tragic episodes and terrible examples of waste of man-powerand energy in the late war.Another historic episode, which I think emphasises the very great improvementwhich has come about in the position of the professional heads of the Services
within the Committee of Imperial Defence, was the grim silence of the First SeaLord when the final stages of the Dardanelles campaign were being discussed.In the presence of the Ministerial First Lord he did not feel that he was in aposition to give his views or that he was called upon to do so. To-day, as we haveheard, it would be incumbent upon a First Sea Lord to offer his opinion and givethe benefit of his professional advice to the Government.With regard to supplies, we can all recall the confusion, not to say competition,that there was between the Services in the War. This was particularly the caseas regards the requirements of the Royal Naval Air Service and the Royal FlyingCorps, and it led ultimately to the formation of the Royal Air Force. (Forentirely different reasons that has, doubtless, been very much to the country&apos;sadvantage to-day, although it is questionable whether it was so at the time.)The Royal Flying Corps, as we know, was starved of engines and other vital partsbecause the R.N.A.S. got in first ; but now there is a special Sub-Committee ofthe Committee of Imperial Defence which would prevent anything of that sorthappening even in peace time, still less in war time.It has been my good fortune as a humble member of one of the Sub-Committeesof the Committee of Imperial Defence to see a little and to read more of the workof the Secretariat, which General Ismay passed over all too modestly. Those ofus who have had an insight of the scope and burden of their labours cannot failto realize the tremendous debt of gratitude which the Services, indeed the nation,owe to that Secretariat. It was that &quot; ruthless, relentless and remorseless &quot;individual, Lord Fisher, who used to say that when a man became indispensableit was time he left ; but I think he would have been the last person to apply thatdictum to the present Lord Hankey. I may say, however, that, having hadsome dealings with his successor, I feel sure the mantle has fallen on very worthyshoulders.Lieutenant-Colonel Pierson : I should like to ask the Lecturer who hasthe final authority in the event of disagreement in the Chiefs of Staff Committeeas far as plans are concerned ? For instance, suppose there was a difference ofopinion about the allotment of an air force for the Army, the Army wishing toincrease or alter this for the time being; would the whole responsibility fall onthe Prime Minister of deciding what is almost a technical matter of the highestimportance or is there any other existing body which would help him to decide ?The matter came up before the Committee of 1923, to which the Lecturer referred.The chief witnesses were Lord Haldane and Sir William Robertson. The lattersaid that he approved entirely of the Chiefs of Staff Committee and he had onlythe one criticism to make to which I have referred. He made a good suggestion,but I do not know whether it was adopted or not. It occurs to me that thistrouble might arise ; judging from history, the Chiefs of Staff are not likely alwaysto agree. Presumably the Prime Minister has the responsibility of giving thefinal decision.THE LECTURERI do not think it would be right to say that it would be the Prime Minister&apos;sresponsibility ; it would be the collective responsibility of the Cabinet.With regard to technical experts disagreeing, do not they disagree in everywalk of life ? I have myself had three different opinions from doctors. Onehas to make up one&apos;s mind which opinion to take. Similarly, if there are differencesof opinion between the Services, the body of men on whom the final decision restshave to make their choice for better or for worse.   I remember an occasion on
which Lord Birkenhead was given diametrically opposed advice, not from twoServices but from two General Staffs of the same Service the Indian GeneralStaff disagreeing with the British General Staff. He said : &quot; Well, some peoplemight find it uncomfortable as laymen to be confronted with these diametricallyopposed opinions from our technical experts. Personally i do not find ituncomfortable in the least. Judges are constantly faced with comparabledifficulties, and I have no hesitation in saying that in my judgment so-and-so isright and so-and-so is wrong.&quot;THE CHAIRMAN :I should like to take advantage of this opportunity of making any observationsof my own to say only two things. One is to illustrate what Captain Altham saidas to the duty of the Chiefs of Staff to express their views to the Committee ofImperial Defence. They do not attend the meetings of the Committee of ImperialDefence merely as the advisers of their Ministers. Lord Haldane, who was alwaysvery insistent upon their responsibility to speak and to let their opinions be knownby active expression of them and not by mere silence or acquiescence, used to insistthat it was most undesirable that the Chiefs of Staff should sit by their respectiveMinisters round the table, lest they might be unduly aware of the contiguity ofthe Ministers and so express their opinions in less decisive terms than weredesirable. The presence of the Chiefs of Staff on the Committee of ImperialDefence is exactly the same as that of Ministers ; they have precisely the sameauthority to express their views and to agree or disagree with Ministers as theMinisters themselves have to express their views and to agree or disagree withone another.With regard to Colonel Pierson&apos;s question, I have had nearly three yearsexperience of the Committee of Imperial Defence and I have known the Chiefsof Staff to disagree on only one occasion, and on that occasion further discussionresulted in their reaching a real agreement upon the principles on which thequestion at issue should be decided. I suppose, however, that all questions onwhich there was disagreement would have to be decided primarily perhaps by theCommittee of Imperial Defence but ultimately by the Cabinet, as General Ismayhas said. As an example of that I may mention the evacuation of Gallipoli,which was in the region of the highest professional knowledge and yet the decisionwas taken by the Cabinet itself and not by the War Committee, because the PrimeMinister thought that, in spite of the fact that the question depended so muchupon technical advice, the decision was of such very great importance that theCabinet should take the responsibility of making it.The customary votes of thanks to the Lecturer and the Chairman were carriedby acclamation.

*HI8 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  October 1944.CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No.THE ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMMITTEE OFIMPERIAL DEFENCE.C)By Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Maurice Hankey. G.C.B., Secretary, Committee ofImperial Defence.Introductory.LIKE London University, the Committee of Imperial Defence is youngcompared with our more venerable institutions. My first predecessor in the officeof Secretary to the Defence Committee (Lord Sydenham) dates to 1904; in thatof Clerk to the Council (John Prophete) to 1389! But if young in years, theCommittee is old in experience. At the tender age of ten years it was subjectedto the supreme test of the Great War, during which it developed in a notablemanner. From that ordeal it emerged with an unequalled experience, andresumed under peace conditions its position to quote the Prime Ministerswords at the Imperial Conference as &quot; our principal organ for the co-ordina-tion of all activities in the sphere of defence.&quot; During its short but eventfulcareer almost every outstanding statesman, sailor, soldier and civil servant in thiscountry, and many from the Dominions and India, have made their contributionto Imperial Defence in the room at Whitehall Gardens where the Committeemeets--the pleasant room once occupied by Lord Beaconsfield, which he leftbecause the stairs were too much for him.(2) I might add that our Chairmanto-night ascends these stairs with agility. I will not mention those now living,but among former attendants at the Committee whose names have passed intohistory are Sir Henry Campbell Bannerman; Mr. Bonar Law; Lord Morley;Lord Curzon; Lord Milner; Sir Wilfrid Laurier; Mr. Massey; General Botha;Mr. Merriman: Admirals of the Fleet Lord Fisher and Sir Arthur Wilson;Field-Marshals Lord Roberts; Lord Kitchener; Lord French; Lord Nicholsonand Sir Henry Wilson; Sir Eyre Crowe.(*)It is not surprising that an institution with this record should attract theattention of this great Lniversity.The Origin.Everyone knows how difficult it often is to discover the real.origin of a greatwar invention.Milton, describing one of the war engines of the fallen angels, hints at thecause : &quot; The invention all admired, and each, how heTo be th&apos; inventor missed, so easy it seemedOnce found, which yet unfound most would have thoughtImpossible. &quot;(4)In the case of the Committee of Imperial Defence we encounter ho suchdifficulty. Several contributed to the idea, but everyone agrees that the realfounder was the Prime Minister of that day, whom we are fortunate to have asour Chairman this evening, Lord Balfour. and who ever since, in office and outof office, in peace and in war, in House of Commons and House of Lords, hasbeen watching over its destinies.  Lord Midleton and Lord Selborne prepared the(l) Delivered as a lecture at the University of London, on the 11th March, 1927, with theEight Hon. the Earl of Balfour, K.G., O.M., in &quot;the Chair.(5) Buckle. Life of Disraeli, Vol. 5, Cap. 8, and Vol. 6, Cap. 5.(3) Note.

way by a Memorandum^) circulated to the Cabinet in November 1902. A monthlater &quot;the Defence Committee of the Cabinet, established by the late LordSalisbury in 1895, was reconstituted tentatively as a Committee of ImperialDefence, but as yet without any permanent organisation. The late Duke ofDevonshire, the Chairman of the previous Cabinet Committee, presided, buthenceforward the Prime Minister (Mr. Balfour) attended regularly, and afteithe reconstruction of his Government in November 1903 himself took the Chair.In January 1904, Lord Eshers War Office (Reconstitution) Committee(6)issued its first Report, a prescient document devoted exclusively to the Committeeof Imperial Defence.&quot; The British Empire,&quot; the Report states, &quot; is pre-eminently a greatNaval, Indian and Colonial Power. There are, nevertheless, no means forco-ordinating defence problems, for dealing with them as a whole, fordefining the proper functions of the various elements, and for ensuring that,on the one hand, peace preparations are carried out upon a consistent plan,and, on the other hand that, in times of emergency, a definite war policy,based upon solid data, can be formulated.&quot;The remedy proposed -was a reconstitution of the existing Cabinet Com-mittee. The Prime Minister was to be its invariable President (on which theutmost stress was laid), with &quot; absolute discretion in the selection andvariation of its Members.&quot; As &quot;the corner-stone of the whole edifice&quot; therewas to be a small&apos;Permanent Secretariat.&quot; On these lines the Committee ofImperial Defence was formally brought into existence bv a Treasury Minutedated the 4th May, 1904.The prevailing note of the new organisation was elasticity. In theory thePrime Minister was the only member, but he could summon anyone he wished.In practice Mr. Balfour and his successors have summoned regularly thoseCabinet Ministers and Staff Officers of both Services who are specially concernedwith the larger questions of defence, other Cabinet Ministers, officials and expertsbeing invited ad hoc according to the particular business before the Committee.In this way the number of people associated with the Committee and itsSub-Committees in the course of a year has come to number hundreds.The Committee was, and remains, advisory and consultative. The Cabinet,as the Executive of Parliament, must decide all questions of major policy; and. defence policy, which is only one aspect of general policy and is bound up withother aspects such as financial, home, foreign, imperial and colonial policy is no exception. So far as His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain is con-cerned, the system was, and remains, that on questions of defence involvingmore than one Government Department the Committee of Imperial Defenceadvises; the Cabinet, in the light of wider considerations, decides, and theGovernment Departments execute. In the case of a Dominion, the decision andexecution rest with its Government. The whole conception is explained veryclearly in the following extract from a speech by Lord Balfour in 1904 : &quot; I think that my hon. friend need not fear that the Defence Com-mittee will in any sense trench upon the responsibilities which properly liein the first place with the Admiralty or the Army Department, and in thesecond remove with the Cabinet as a whole. In truth, I think that one ofthe great merits of the Defence Committee is that it has no executiveauthority at all. It has no power to give an order to the humblest soldierin His Majesty&apos;s Army or the most powerless sloop under the control of theAdmiralty, f think that this is especially valuable from a point of viewnot yet touched upon namely, the relations between the Defence Committeeandthose self-governing Colonies of the Empire over which no office in thiscountry has any control at all. I hope that when any problem of defencewhich touches them nearly comes up, and even when they take a closerinterest in the problems of Imperial defence as a whole, we may have theadvantage of their assistance in our councils. But I am certain that theself-governing Colonies will never allow any representative of theirs to cometo the Defence Committee if the Defence Committee with that addition hadthe smallest authority to impose obligations, financial, political, military, ornaval, on the Colonies which they represent. But we are so constituted thatthe only thing the Defence Committee may give, either to a Department athome or to the Cabinet or to the Colonial Governments, is advice.(5) Parliamentary Debates, Fourth Series, Vol. 139, Col. 617.(&apos;) Lord Esher (Chairman), Viee-Admiral Sir John Fisher, Lieutenant-Colonel Sir GeorgeSydenham Clarke. Colonel G. F. Ellison (Secretary).
&quot; It is quite true that, so far as the Home Departments are concerned,advice from a Committee which contains the Prime Minister, and whichpractically never meets without having the assistance of the Secretary ofState for War, the First Lord of the Admiralty, the Head of the ArmyGeneral Staff, the Head of the Army Intelligence Department, the First SeaLord, and the Head of the Naval Intelligence Department it is, I say,practically certain that a Committee so constituted is likely to have its advicetaken by the Departments; but we have a great many functions to performwhich go outside the jurisdiction of any of those offices. There are the self-governing Colonies, and anything they can do or are ready to do for Imperialdefence. There is India. It is, no doubt, intimately connected with theproblem of defence and with the Government of this country, but the Cabinetcannot give orders to India in the same sense, or with the same facility, or,indeed, in any way corresponding to the way in which they give orders tothe First Lord of the Admiralty or the Secretary for War. It is, therefore,from that point of view of the very first importance that our functions shouldbe so restricted that we cannot interfere with administration in any wayeither at home or abroad. It is only by thus strictly limiting our functionsthat we can have that authority which I hope we shall more and more gainin the general scheme of Imperial defence, and that our opinions will carrythat weight which will be all the more effective because there is behind themno power of coercive authority.&quot;(7)II.Mr. Balfour&apos;s Government.One distinctive feature of the early days of the Committee was the carelavished on it by Lord Balfour. In his last two years of office he did not missone of the 60 meetings. This period might be termed the phase of principle,for the Committee was largely engaged in hammering out the great fundamentalprinciples governing our Imperial Defence in such matters as reliance onsea-power; the respective roles of the Navy and Army; home defence; thedefence of India; coast defence, &amp;c. principles which have stood the test untilto-day. In this work Lord Balfour was assisted by Lord Sydenharn, the FirstSecretary, who organised the Secretariat on lines so sound that they have beenfollowed mutatis mutandis ever since. He was succeeded in 1907 by my immediatepredecessor. Rear-Admiral Sir Charles Ottley, who occupied the post with greatdistinction throughout a strenuous period until my appointment in May 1912,after four years&apos; apprenticeship as an Assistant Secretary.III.The Liberal Government.With the advent to office of Sir Henry Campbell Bannerman the friends ofthe Committee felt some misgivings, as the new Prime Minister was known tofeel doubts as to its usefulness. But their fears proved groundless, for. asMr. Asquith told the House of Commons a few years later, Sir Henry CampbellBannerman &quot; after he had served on the Committee a few years, had attended andpresided at its deliberations, was satisfied that it was a useful and, indeed, aninvaluable addition to our constitutional machinery.&quot;(*)One innovation made by Sir Henry was an invitation to Lord Esher to attendregularly. Lord Esher, as Chairman of the War Office (Reconstitution)Committee, was, as it were, godfather to the Defence Committee. From 1906 to1914 he rarely missed a meeting, and rendered invaluable service. Mr. Asquithincreased the panel of regular attendants by a number of distinguished formeroccupants of high offices associated with the Committee of Imperial Defence,such as Lord Morley (after he had left the India Office to become Lord Presidentof the Council). Lord Haldane (who in 1912 had left the War Office to becomeLord Chancellor), Lord Kitchener, Lord Fisher. Sir Arthur Wilson, Lord French,Lord Nicholson.Sir Henry Campbell Bannerman also left his mark on the Committee by anextension of the Sub-Committee system, which was still further developed by(7) Parliamentary Debates, Fourth Series, 1904, Vol. 139, Cols. 618 and 619.(&apos;) Parliamentary Debates, Commons, 1912, Vol. XLI, Cols. 1385-6.
Mr. Asquith. Some of these Sub-Committees were permanent; others set upad hoc for particular inquiries. The permanent Committees, viz., the OverseasDefence Committee, Home Ports Defence Committee, Co-ordination Committee,and Air Committee, dealt mainly with details, and were composed of Staff Officersand permanent officials.Larger questions of policy were dealt with by Committees appointed ad hocand composed of Cabinet Ministers and officers holding the highest Serviceappointments. Their work is outlined in Lord Oxford&apos;s book, The Genesis of theWar. After describing the political developments which compelled thoseresponsible for the Government to have in mind the possibility of Great Britainbeing engaged in a great war, however much against her will, Lord Oxford says,&quot; It was therefore our manifest duty, and we never lost sight of it, to preparefor the worst.&quot;   He tells how one detailed inquiry followed another : In 1907, under Lord Morley, into the Military Eequirements of theEmpire as affected by India;In 1907-08, under Mr. Asquith himself, into the risk of invasion. Thisinvestigation was set on foot at the instance of Lord Balfour. who drewMr. Asquith&apos;s attention to Lord Roberts&apos;s misgivings. It is interesting torecall that, after some months&apos; inquiry, Lord Balfour (who, of course, wasthen in Opposition) was sent all the papers and attended a meeting to give hisviews. Lord Balfour was also a full member of another Committee on thesame subject in 1913-14.In 1908-09, a most&quot; important inquiry under Mr. Asquith into themilitary needs of the Empire as affected by the Continent of Europe; as wellas inquiries under Lord Morley into our military needs as affected by Egypt,and into the position in Southern Persia and the Persian Gulf, with specialregard to the Bagdad Railway; and under Mr. Asquith into Lord CharlesBeresford&apos;s allegations against the Admiraltv. the Report of which latterwas published as a Parliamentary Paper (Cmd. 256, 1909).These and other inquiries, covering a vast field, may be described as the phaseof policy in the evolution of our defensive preparation to meet &quot;the new politicalgrouping of Europe   It was completed by August 1909.&quot; It would not be an unjust claim to say,&quot; writes Lord Oxford, &quot; thatthe Government had by that date investigated the whole of the ground coveredby a possible war with Germany the naval position; the possibilities of ablockade; the invasion problem; the Continental problem; the Egyptianproblem. &quot;OThe next phase, if we may so term the evolution of events, was one of detailedpreparation. Lord Oxford describes how inquiries were inaugurated into suchmatters as the treatment of enemy and neutral shipping : enemy trade : our ownsupplies : control of railways and ports: insurance of ships and cargoes againstwar risks : counter-espionage: censorship : treatment of enemy aliens : cable andwireless communications. Between 1909 and 1914 these and other detailedquestions were systematically examined by a series of Sub-Committees, theconclusions, after approval by the Committee of Imperial Defence, being embodiedin a &quot; War Book,&quot; where the responsibility for action in an emergency was laiddown.Representatives of the Dominions attended meetings of the Committeeduring the Imperial Defence Conference of 1909 and the Imperial Conference1911. when important statements on all aspects of Imperial Defence as affected byinternational developments were made by Mr. Asquith, Sir Edward Grey andother Ministers, and the whole position was explained. These statements werebrought up to date in the following year at meetings attended by Sir RobertBorden and some of his colleagues in the Canadian Cabinet. Between 1912 andthe outbreak of war, other representatives of the Dominions on visits to thiscountrv from time to time attended meetings of the Committee; for example,Sir James Allen, on behalf of New Zealand; Mr. (now Sir Thomas) White andMr. Burrell, on behalf of Canada; Sir Edward (now Lord). Morris, on behalf ofNewfoundland: and Sir George Perley, who, in addition to holding the post ofHigh Commissioner for Canada, had authority to attend meetings of theCommittee of Imperial Defence. In addition, the Dominions and Colonies werekept informed of our inquiries, so far as applicable to them, and made their ownplans.(*) The Genesis of the War, Chapter XV.
All these preparations were precautionary and non-provocative, and, asLord Grey has well said    &apos;&quot; The distinction between preparations made with the intention of goingto war and precautions against attack is a distinction clear and definite in theminds of those who build up armaments.&quot;(&quot;)Given the circumstances of the day a hundred years without a great war,the inexperience of statesmen and soldiers alike of war on the grand scale,a Government busy on a great programme of social reform, a policy directedabove all to the maintenance of peace given all this, our defensive arrange-ments were not ineffective. They did secure that (with trifling exceptions) ourterritory remained intact; that panic was avoided; that our trade continuedwithout serious interruption; that the enemy&apos;s trade was brought to a standstilluntil indirect channels could be found; that our small army was swiftly andsilently transported to France without loss. The pre-arranged steps for passingfrom a state of peace to a state of war in a single night worked, on the whole,smoothly and silently. &quot; Special arrangements had been made so that in everyoffice responsible officials should be ready at all hours to take immediate action.The requisite telegrams amounting to thousands-were carefully arranged inorder of priority of despatch in order to prevent congestion on the day ofaction; every possible letter and document was kept ready in an addressedenvelope; special envelopes were designed so that they could at once be recognisedas taking priority of everything. All necessary papers. Orders in Councd andProclamations, were printed or set up in type, and so far was the system carriedthat the King never moved without having with him those which required hisimmediate signature.&quot;(&quot;) When the Cabinet dispersed on that fateful evening ofthe outbreak of war. after the solemn silence which we are told followed the laststroke of Big Ben, they knew at least that the arrangements which had taken solong to prepare were set in motion; that the news had been flashed to the remotestcorners of the world, to warships. Dominions. India, Colonies, Protectorates.Embassies, Legations, to Police authorities, Port authorities and Railwayofficials, and that everywhere pre-arranged instructions would be acted on; thatthe Grand Fleet was at its station; that patrols were at sea, and coast batteriesvigilant; that the army mobilisation arrangements were complete; that theenemy&apos;s merchant ships were being detained in port throughout the Empire;that our own mercantile marine would put to sea under the protection of theNavy, but insured against war risks; that enemy aliens would be dealt with;that the enemy&apos;s espionage system was already being broken up; that printers&quot;were striking off Proclamations already set up in type, and bill-stickers werewaiting to post them up; that the Press had agreed not to publish informationof value to the enemy. Next day, with their minds freed from this mass ofadministrative detail, they could confront the gigantic task before them. Thelate Sir Julian Corbett sums up the matter in the following passage of theOfficial Naval History :  .&quot;Amongst the many false impressions that prevailed, when after thelapse of a century we found ourselves involved in a great war, not the leasterroneous is the belief that we were not prepared for it. Whether the scaleon which we prepared was as large as the signs of the times called for.whether we did right to cling to our long-tried system of a small Armyand a large Navy, are questions which will long be debated; but. given thescale which we deliberately chose to adopt, there is no doubt that themachinery for setting our forces in action had reached an orderedcompleteness in detail that has no parallel in our history.&quot;The great work of the Admiralty. War Office, and other GovernmentDepartments must not be underrated, but this result could never have beenachieved without the central co-ordination of the Committee of Imperial Defence.The War. . ,During the War the Committee of Imperial Defence underwent greatchanges, but, as I shall now show, the procedure and methods of the Committeeand its Secretariat persisted throughout all the developments of nomenclatureand organisation in the higher control of the War. Only for the first few weeksdid the Committee function on the same lines as before the war, working mainly(10) Twenty-five Years, Chapter VI.Naval Operations, Vol. I, Cap. 1, Corbett.
through Sub-Committees, one of which was devoted to the smaller overseasexpeditions. During this period the Cabinet kept the main conduct of the warin its own hands. This arrangement, however, did not last long. Thomqs Hobbessays in the Leviathan: &quot; Fourthly, in Deliberations that ought to be kept secret (whereof therebe many occasions in Publique Businesse), the Counsels of many, andespecially in Assemblies, are dangerous; and therefore great Assemblies arenecessitated to commit such affairs to lesser numbers, and of such personsas are most versed, and in.whose fidelity they have most confidence.&quot;(Chapter XXV.)On this principle, from November 1914 until December 1916 the detailedstudy of larger questions of strategy was, with the consent of the Cabinet, referredto a smaller body known at first as the *&apos; War Council &quot;; immediately after theformation of the first Coalition Government as the &quot; Dardanelles Committee&quot;;and, a few months later, as the &quot; War Committee.&quot;(,J)   These bodies, asMr. Asquith informed the House of Commons, absorbed the functions of theCommittee of Imperial Defence,(&quot;) which they closely resembled.   The maindifference was that they had more executive authority, the extent of which wasexplained by Mr. Asquith to the House of Commons in the following terms : &quot; I entirely agree with those who say and I have had plenty ofexperience that it is very undesirable, and leads to delay and often toconfusion, that decisions which have to be taken, very often at very shortnotice, should not become effective until they are referred to the Cabinet asa whole. That is perfectly true. I think a Committee such as I have indicatedought to be clothed with power to take such decisions, and to act upon them.On the other hand, I am very jealous of the maintenance of collective Cabinetresponsibility for large changes and new departures in policy; but I believethat in practice it will be found perfectly capable of working the two thingstogether. That is what we propose to do.&quot;(14)Subject to this, and to Some minor technical differences (such as meeting at10 Downing Street instead of 2 Whitehall Gardens, and elaborate precautionsfor secrecy), &quot; the composition and function of the War Council did not materiallydiffer from those of the Committee of Imperial Defence.&quot;(15) The Chairman andthe Secretary were the same for both. The members were chosen from among theregular attendants at the Committee of Imperial Defence, and included theChiefs of Staff of the Fighting Services. And, as at the Defence Committee, otherMinisters and high naval and military officers, such as the Commander-in-Chiefof the Expeditionary Force, were invited to the War Council or War Committeewhen the business required. Mr. Balfour (though not in office) and Admiral ofthe Fleet Sir Arthur Wilson (who held no official appointment) were regularlyinvited to the original War Council, and once, when the Russian claim toConstantinople and the Straits was under consideration. Lord&apos; Lansdowne andMr. Bonar Law. the Leaders of the Opposition, attended.(16) In June 1916Mr. Hughes, the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, attended a meeting ofthe War Committee. In a word, Mr. Asquith&apos;s War Council and War Committeewere an adaptation to the circumstances of the war of the elastic machinerydevised by Lord Balfour in 1904. the only important difference being that the newbody, though still subordinate to the Cabinet, had greater powers of decision thanthe Committee of Imperial Defence.When Mr. Lloyd George became Prime Minister, a further developmenttook place, and the functions of the Cabinet and War Committee were combinedin a smaller body known as the &quot; War Cabinet,&quot; composed of the Prime Ministerand five other Ministers, all of whom, with the exception of Mr. Bonar Law,were without portfolio.In his essay on Counsel, Bacon says &quot; The counsels at this day in most places are but familiar meetings,where matters.are rather talked on than debated.  And they run too swiftto the order or act of counsel.  It were better that, in causes of weight, thematter were propounded one day and not spoken to till next day; in nocteconsilium.&quot;(&quot;) Parliamentary Debates. 1915, Vol. L.XXV, Col. 525.(&quot;) /bid., Col. 1653.(**) Ibid., Col. 526.(,5) First Keport of the Dandanelles Commission, Paragraph 15.(&quot;) The World Crisis, Churchill, Vol. II, Cap. IX.
The War Cabinet system complied with this dictum by bringing to the wholerange of Cabinet business the tried methods of the Committee of ImperialDefence, namely, the propounding of the question one day in Agenda paperswith the circulation of Memoranda on all its aspects, and its discussion on a laterday with a full record of the decisions reached, which was promptly communicatedto all whom it might concern.The War Cabinet, of course, had the full powers of decision of the formerCabinet, instead of the more limited powers of the War Committee. Apart fromthis, all the distinctive features of the Committee of Imperial Defence werecarried on : the elasticity of procedure; the close association of the Chiefs ofStaff of the Fighting Services; the summoning of outside Ministers, Staff Officersand experts; the extensive use of Sub-Committees, and the rest. The Secretariatwas the Secretariat of the Committee of Imperial Defence, enlarged to enableit to cope with the work. This Secretariat also served the Imperial War Cabinet(i.e., the War Cabinet enlarged to include representatives of the Dominions andIndia), which was brought into being shortly after the establishment of the WarCabinet, and which, as Mr. Winston Churchill says. &quot; centred in a single executivethe world-spread resources of the British monarchy.&apos;&apos;(&quot;) In November 1917a branch of the Secretariat was established at Versailles as the British Sectionof the Allied Secretariat of the Supreme War Council.To enter in detail into the work of these bodies is beyond the scope of thislecture It is sufficient to note that the Committee of Imperial Defence providedthe foundation on which three successive Governments erected their machineryfor co-ordinating the responsibilities of the Admirals and Generals, whose taskwas to beat the enemy, with those of the statesmen and civilians who had toprovide the means amid a thousand conflicting demands, out of resources which,especially in the later stages of the War, were severely strained. I do not say-that this machinery cannot be criticised, but, so far as my knowledge goes, nobelligerent in the Great War evolved anything better. For example. GeneralLudendorff tells us that &quot; The machinery of government in Berlin gave the impression of beingextremely clumsy.   The various departments worked side by side withoutany real sympathy or cohesion, and there was infinite &apos; overlapping.&apos;   Theleft hand did not know what the right hand was doing.&quot;(&quot;)At any rate the War Cabinet and Imperial War Cabinet, erected on the founda-tions so well and truly laid by Mr. Balfour, were the instruments by whichMr. Lloyd George and his colleagues steered us to victory.Post-War.In November 1919, after the Peace Conference, the war-time union of theCabinet and the Committee of Imperial Defence was dissolved. The War Cabinetwas replaced by a Cabinet of normal size, and the Committee of Imperial Defencereverted to a peace footing under its maiden name. At first the atmosphere wasunfavourable. The world was in chaos; crisis succeeded crisis at home -atjabroad; La^kdemobilisation was in full swing; the Government and the whole administrationwere overburdened with all these problems: the strictest economy was, andremains, the order of the day; the nation was war-weary, and the thought ofre-commencing defensive preparation odious; data for reconstruction of ourdefensive organisation were lacking.We had, however, some assets. The Committee of Imperial Defence ofcourse had in its custody the archives of its war progeny-the War Council,Dardanelles Committee, War Committee, War Cabinet, Imperial War Cabinet,as well as of the Inter-Allied Conferences, Supreme War Council and PeaceConference, and of all their subordinate organisations. There was a HistoricalSection (which has by now provided fifteen volumes of official history), and therewere exhaustive reports from many Departments and Committees on their warexperience, which first Mr. Asquith and later Mr. Lloyd George had had&apos;prepared. There were available also persons with every type of war experience.Before the war we had often deplored the lack of full records of the administra-tive experience of Napoleonic Wars -I myself once spent six months inresearch on one single subject. A number of Sub-Committees were set up,therefore, in February 1920 to overhaul our pre-war arrangements in the lightof accumulated experience. If ever we or our descendants have once more tomeet a oreat emergency (which God forbid!) ignorance of what was done in theGreat War should not prove a difficulty.(17) The World Crisis,. 1916-18, Chapter X. (&apos;*) My War Memories, Page 263.
In May, 1921, Mr. Lloyd George, unable amid his overwhelming preoccupa-tions to give much time to the Committee, set up a body called the StandingDefence Sub-Committee, over which he asked Lord Balfour to preside. In allbut name it was the Committee of Imperial Defence, and its records are reckonedand numbered as those of the parent Committee. I only mention the point inorder to show that the title of the Committee has changed occasionally in peaceas well as in war. But soon the work began to develop on normal lines, and bythe summer of 1921 the Committee of Imperial Defence was again in full swing.There was one new factor which rendered the work of the Committee evenmore important than before the War, namely, the existence of the Royal AirForce as a separate arm under a separate Ministry. If co-ordination had beennecessary when there were but two arms, how much more essential was it whenthere were three! The problems thus presented attracted much public attention.Many proposals were made for simplifying the problem, such as the re-absorption of the Air Force into the older Services; the absorption of all threeMinistries into a single Ministry of Defence, the formation of a Ministry ofDefence superimposed on the three Ministries; a joint General Staff; theamalgamation of the common administrative services, and so forth.These proposals, and variants of them, were exhaustively investigated, onthe policy and staff side, by a Sub-Committee under Lord Salisbury(&quot;) (who wasacting as Chairman of the Committee of Imperial Defence), and on theadministrative side by Lord Weirs Committee on the Amalgamation of ServicesCommon to the Navy, Army and Air Force.(20) Both Reports were publishedas Parliamentary Papers. The more drastic changes were rejected by both theseenquiries. The useful results of Lord Weirs recommendations lie outside oursubject, but Lord Salisbury&apos;s Committee resulted in developments to the Com-mittee of Imperial Defence (notably the establishment of the Chiefs of StaffSub-Committee) which will be referred to later.The Labour Government.When the Labour Government assumed office the changes just referred tohad already come into operation. In spite of the interest he felt.in the Com-mittee of Imperial Defence, Mr. Ramsay MacDonald found it impossible toassume the day-to-day direction of its affairs in addition to his work as PrimeMinister and Foreign Secretary. On the more important occasions he presidedin person, and it will be recalled that when the question of the Channel Tunnelwas under consideration he invited all the former Presidents of the Committee,irrespective of party, to attend Lord Balfour, Lord Oxford, Mr. Lloyd Georgeand Mr. Baldwin!&quot;&apos;)-an episode recalling Mr. Asquith&apos;s similar invitation toMr. Balfour in 1908 and 1913. But apart from such occasions Mr. MacDonalddelegated the Chairmanship to Lord Haldane, who had long been one of the Com-mittee&apos;s staunchest&quot; supporters.The Present Position.Constitutional Position.The constitutional position of the Committee is the same as in 1904.Composition.The nucleus of members invited to its meetings (based on the Report ofLord Salisbury&apos;s Committee) is as follows : The Prime Minister (Chairman),The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,The Lord President of the Council,The Lord Privy Seal,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Secretary of State for the Colonies and Dominion Affairs,The Secretary of State for War,The Secretary of State for India,The Secretary of State for Air,The First Lord of the Admiralty,The Chiefs of Staff of the three Fighting Services,The Permanent Secretary to the Treasury, as Head of the Civil Service.(&quot;) Cmd. 2029.(&quot;) Cmd. 2649/26.(21) Parliamentary Debates, Vol. 675, No. 101, Cols. 1784-8.
Other Ministers of the Crown in Great Britain or the Dominions, representativesof India or the Colonies, and other officials or persons having special qualifiea-tions, are summoned as members according to the nature of the business.Representatives of the Dominions and India attended the Committee during therecent Imperial Conference.Secretariat.The Secretariat consists of a Secretary, who is also Secretary to the Cabinet a development of constitutional practice that is outside my present theme andfour Assistant Secretaries--one from each of the Fighting Services and one fromIndia. In technical matters arising on the manv Sub-Committees the AssistantSecretaries are often supplemented by experts deputed from one of the Govern-ment Departments. Thus reinforced, the Secretariat also supplies the secretariatfor all Sub-Committees.The Sub-Committee Organisation.It would be impossible for the Committee of Imperial Defence itself toinvestigate in detail the whole field of defensive preparation. Imperial Defenceis not a matter confined to navies, armies and air forces, but may require thewhole of the resources of the Empire. Consequently details are remitted toStanding Sub-Committees or to Sub-Committees appointed ad hoc, operatingeach in a distinct sphere and reporting to the Committee of Imperial Defence inaccordance with the practice that grew up before the War. Such is the inter-dependence of the Services and the Civilian Departments that there is nopermanent Sub-Committee which has no civilian member.(&quot;)The organisation of the Committee of Imperial Defence can convenientlybe compared with that of a Service Department. The Admiralty, War Officeand Air Ministry have each A Cabinet Minister who presides atA Board or Council,A First professional member dealing with policy, strategy and tactics,A Second professional member dealing with personnel,A Third and (except in the Air Ministry) a Fourth professional memberdealing  with  different  branches  of  construction,  supply  andtransport.Similarly the Committee of Imperial Defence has -A Prime Minister who presides atThe Committee,A Chiefs of Staff Committee on strategical questions common to thethree Services,A Man-Power Committee on personnel.A Principal Supply Officers&apos; Committee on joint supply questions.Just as the Service Departments have subordinate sections dealing with allkinds of details, so the Committee of Imperial Defence has its subordinateSub-Committees to co-ordinate, each within its own range of activity, both theFighting Services and the other Departments concerned.For example, working in the orbit of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, theOverseas Defence Committee, started 40 years ago under the title of the ColonialDefence Committee, deals with questions of Colonial Defence; the Home DefenceCommittee (as the old Home Ports Defence Committee is now termed) withHome Defence: on matters of principle common to both they meet as oneCommittee.Similarly, the Man-Power and Principal Supply Officers&apos; Committee, eachdealing with a great branch of national defensive organisation, appoint Sub-Committees to work out points of detail. There are also Committees on all kindsof subjects, such as Reduction and Limitation of Armaments. Trading andBlockade, Air Raid Precautions, Insurance against War Risks, and manv othermatters. There are at times more than 50 Committees and Sub-Committees atone time. The Prime Minister, in his published address to the ImperialConference, mentioned that in the year ended the 31st March. 1926. the Committeeand its Sub-Committees were attended in the aggregate by 430 different persons.(22) Even the Chiefs of Staff Committee has the Chairman of the Committee of ImperialDefence as ex-officio Chairman.
including 19 Ministers of the Crown, 6 representatives of the Overseas Empire,142 Service Officers, 157 Civil Servants and 48 outside experts. The scope ofthe work must be measured not by the size of the Secretariat, but by theco-ordinated activities of the 430 persons (many with staffs of their own), eachwithin his own sphere making some contribution be it great or small.Chiefs of Staff Committee.The functions of the Committee of Chiefs of Staff are set forth in thefollowing passage in the Report of Lord Salisbury&apos;s Committee : &quot; In addition to the functions of the Chiefs of Staff as advisers onquestions of sea. land or air policy respectively, to their own Board orCouncil, each of the three Chiefs of Staff will have an individual andcollective responsibility for advising on defence policy as a whole, the threeconstituting, as it were, a Super-Chief of a War Staff in Commission. Incarrying out this function they will meet together for the discussion ofquestions which affect their joint responsibilities.&apos;^2)This must be read in conjunction with the function of the Chairman, who isenjoined &quot;assisted by the three Chiefs of Staff .... to keep the defencesituation as a whole constantly under review.&quot;In order to emphasise their responsibilities, those have been embodied in aWarrant, signed by the Prime Minister and furnished to each Chief of Staff.As the Prime Minister told the Imperial Conference, one advantage of thissystem is that on strategical problems the Committee of Imperial Defence nowreceives collective advice, instead of separate and possibly contradictory advicefrom the three angles of sea, land and air. As he also told the Conference, theChiefs of Staff have furnished the Government with a comprehensive survey of ourdefensive situation as a whole, based on appreciations from the Foreign Office andother Government Departments. It is significant also of the close working of theService Departments that the strategical aspects of Imperial Defence were at therecent Conference dealt with by Lord Beatty, who spoke as the mouthpiece of theChiefs of Staff Committee.The Imperial Defence College.A word must be added in regard to another innovation the Imperial DefenceCollege, which, for professional purposes, is under the direction of the Chiefs ofStaff Committee. Each Service has its Staff College, which provides it with acorps of officers trained in the technicalities of Staff work (which differs in eachService). In the same way the function of the Imperial Defence College, whichonly started last January, is the training of a body of officers and civilian officialsin the broadest aspects of Imperial strategy. Officers of some of the Dominionsare taking part in the first course.Observations.I will conclude by one or two observations of a general character.Firstly, it is generally conceded that, in the interests of efficiency no less thanof economy, the complex system of modern government requires some centralinstrument to secure co-ordination in defence matters. France has its ConseilSuperieur de Defense Nationale, Italy a corresponding body. In our case, for thereasons already given, the central organisation must be sufficiently flexible toenable the Dominions to avail themselves of it to such extent as they desire,and. even if there were not other urgent reasons, this involves an advisory status.Secondly, I would stress the importance of frequent consultation in thesematters between Statesmen and Service men.   Machiavelli says that &apos;&apos; a prince ought to have no other aim or thought, nor select anything elsefor his study than war and its rules and discipline; for this is the sole artthat belongs to him who rules.&quot;(&quot;)However applicable to an Italian State in the sixteenth century, that observationrates too high the isolated study of war in the outfit of a modern statesman.But it contains a truth. The experience of the late war, both in this countryand abroad, confirmed the experience of earlier wars, that the general directionof the war and the big decisions of policy and strategy rest with the Government.(**) Cmd. 2029/24.(&quot;) Machiavelli&apos;s Prinze, Chapter 14.
Those decisions must be taken largely on the advice of, and in consultation with,the responsible sailors, soldiers and airmen. It is equally important that thestatesmen should understand the point of view of their technical advisers, andthat the professional fighting men should realise the difficulties of the statesman.In this way decisions will be reached in which both have confidence. That happvresult will be the more easily achieved if thev have studied defensive problemstogether in time of peace.Thirdly, for the same reason it is important that there should be acorresponding close contact in peace between the Fighting Services and thecivilians and civil servants on whom responsibility for many vital servicesancillary to operations of war falls. This can best be done by discussing thesematters on equal terms round a table. In other words, the central organisationshould be inter-departmental.Fourthly, in emphasising co-ordination of the whole we must not overlookthe co-ordination of the parts. The Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministryhave each a vast field of co-ordination on sea, land and air respectively. It isvital that in exercising its functions the central co-ordinating authority shouldneither tamper with nor overshadow their responsibility in this respect.These requirements are complied with by our existing organisation. TheCommittee of Imperial Defence is sufficiently elastic to enable the Dominions andIndia to take part in discussion and preparation to the extent that each inavdecide. Its advice is available to every part of the Empire. Periodical ImperialConferences afford an opportunity for discussing defence and formulating theprinciples and methods of co-operation and mutual assistance.The Committee provides for the continuous study of defence problems byCabinet Ministers, the Fighting Services and Civil Servants. It is inter-departmental, but it does not impair the responsibility of Departments. Itenables the vast store of expert and scientific knowledge outside the Government,which is so generously given, to be drawn upon. It is progressive. As thewar showed, it is readily adaptable to the varying circumstances of a war ofany magnitude. It depends, as any system dealing with such immeasurable forcesmust depend, upon good team-work; but nowadays team-work is not only theaim of the Fighting Services, and. indeed, of the whole Public Service, but isessential, under the conditions of the modern world, to that complete grasp andclear vision of the consequences of scientific warfare which must be reckonedamong the best securities for the maintenance of peace.The Earl of Balfour: My Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen, I think all of youwho have listened to the lecture just delivered by Sir Maurice Hankey will agreethat I did not exaggerate when I stated at the commencement of our meeting thathe was pre-eminently competent to deal with the subject which he had chosen forhis lecture. He knows it, indeed, historically; he knows it practically; he knowsit in all its details; he knows it in peace, and he knew it in war; and, as it seemsto me. the account which he has given of the relation of this novel organ ofconsultation is a contribution valuable, not merely to military experts, but toall who are interested in the working of our Constitution.How to treat the problem of national defence as what it really is a singlewhole has preoccupied many thinkers. For States whose only perils come eitherfrom hostile armies or from hostile fleets the question may seem less pressing.But for us who are amphibious, whose insular position without command of thesea would be a peril rather than a security, whose proximity to Europe andImperial responsibilities make an Army and an Air Force absolute necessities,the question of co-ordination becomes of most obvious importance.For this reason I have a considerable sympathy, not, indeed, with thesuggestion that we ought to have a Ministry of Defence, but with the aspirationsunderlying it; for the idea underlying it is the idea of co-ordination. Thosewho desire a Ministry of Defence desire it because they think it would give usa degree of co-ordination which at the present time, in their view, we onlyimperfectly possess. I think there are many objections of an administrativekind to the scheme which are not germane to our subject. There is, however, onewhich does immediately concern us. I dislike a Ministry of Defence, not becauseit forces co-ordination on us where co-ordination is not required, but becauseit is wholly incapable of giving us the degree of co-ordination which seems to meabsolutely necessary. What a Ministry of Defence professes to do is to co-ordinatethe Fighting Services. But what, Ladies and Gentlemen, in these modern daysare the Fighting Services? The Fighting Services are the cutting edge of &quot;adefensive mechanism which includes every Department of State and all the
national energies which these departments control or direct. Great is thedifference in this respect between modern war and the wars of even one hundredyears ago. The wars of a hundred years ago were professional wars. The warsof to-day are national wars: not national merely in the sense of dealing withgreat national interests, but national in the sense of requiring every unit in thenation to bear its own share of a burden which in other times was almost whollyborne by the Army and the Navy. Now it is surely self-evident that you cannotpossibly co-ordinate all the forces of a nation if &apos;yo\x limit your co-ordinatingmachinery to the three Fighting Services. And one of the immense advantagesof the Committee of Imperial Defence is that it does deliberately and explicitlyinclude within the sphere of its considerations every department of the Govern-ment, and, in time of war, every- national activity, which can be enlisted in supportof the common cause.But although this is one of the greatest services which the Committee ofImperial Defence performs, it is not the only one. It has performed, and isperforming, another duty which, for sheer want of proper machinery, was neveradequately attempted before. It sets itself out to foresee the kind of strain whichat the outbreak of war will suddenly be imposed upon the whole social systemof a modern State, and, as far as possible, to prepare beforehand the means ofmitigating its effects. The danger I speak of hangs over all belligerent countries;but to us it is specially menacing. Our Empire is scattered all over the world; itsseparate parts are divided by vast oceans; their frontiers are of limitless length;no portions of them can be treated as the inevitable theatre of a defensivestruggle; we are dependent for our very existence on the maintenance of economicconditions which are complicated, delicate, and in some respects peculiarly opento attack. If you add to those special difficulties the wider consideration thatour Imperial Constitution, containing many autonomous elements, cannot, fromthe nature of the case, be worked with the smooth rapidity of a centralised State,it will become abundantly clear that, for us, the problems of war stretch farbeyond the administrative limits of the great Fighting Services.These are considerations which ought not to be, and I am sure will not be,forgotten by anyone who tries to estimate the advantages we have obtained fromthe institution of the Committee of Imperial Defence. But there is another aspectof the subject which I think deserves consideration I mean the Constitutionalaspect. It is not always easy to make even the most useful addition to a historicstructure like that of the British Empire without inflicting some injury on itsmore ancient parts. This danger the Committee of Imperial Defence has, I think,completely avoided. It provides (as we have seen) a continuing instrument oforganised consultation between experts within and without the GovernmentDepartments, the Ministers responsible to the British Parliament, and, when theydesire it, the Ministers responsible to the Dominion Parliaments also. Ittherefore touches our national and imperial life at innumerable points. Butnowhere and under no conditions can it modify or limit Parliamentary control orministerial responsibility; and, though it may find itself (if circumstancesrequire) in closest relations with any or every Department of State, yet this cannotengender either friction or jealousy. The Committee is not a super-Department;it has no executive responsibilities; it gives no orders; it only gives advice; andin framing that advice the representatives of all the Departments concerned aresure to take their share. It thus supplies a machinery which is not only cheap,efficient and infinitely flexible, but one which can give help to all Governmentswhatever their political complexion, though it cannot shelter any Minister or anyGovernment from the Parliamentary consequences of their own bad luck or badmanagement.Ladies and Gentlemen. I feel I have been occupying too much of your time-for I did not get up so much to make a speech on my own account as to express!as I am sure I may on your behalf, our sincere thanks to Sir Maurice Hankey forthe admirable address which he has given us. He has compressed into a lectureof an hour a brilliant account of the activities of the institution with which hisname is so closely and so honourably connected. Largely during his term of officethat institution has reached a point of organised efficiency which makes it Itrust, immune from all the changes and chances of our Party Government. It istherg; its foundations are well and truly laid; and when&apos;those who have hadsomething to do with its early activities have handed on to their successors thecontrol of the institution which they have endeavoured to create, I am sure thatamong the names most honoured in its history&apos; will be that of Sir Maurice Hankey.
