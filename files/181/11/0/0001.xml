This chapter is concerned primarily with currentprocedure;   but ae past practice may be relevant in*waling with new cases, a general historical note isappended, and there is a separate volume of digests,alphabetically arranged, of all cases of any significancewhich have been dealt with in the Office and recordedin the files.     The tabulated index to the case digestsis designed to facilitate reference to cases fallingunder the various rules of procedure;   references toillustrative cases have therefore not as a rule beenincorporated in the text, though references to the filesualing with points of policy and procedure are given.
Official information is the property of the Crown.Any person, whether a servant of the Crown or not, whopubli8heB or otherwise discloses official information,without official authority, is liable to prosecutionunder the Official SecretB Acts of 1911 and 1c20 orunder the Copyright Act of 1SH1.     Ministers and formerMinisters are, additionally, regarded as bound bytheir oath as iTivy Counsellors not to divulgeproceedings of the Privy Council or the Cabinet.2.    All persons who hold or have held office underthe Crown are under an obligation to consult theGovernment of the day or the head of the Departaentconcerned before publishing for private purposes anyunpublished information which they have obtained byvirtue of their official position, and in doubtfulcases to obtain foruial peraiseion including, wherenecessary, the consent of the Crown to such publication(iir. Attlee&apos;s statement of 17/3A2 - Hansard, House ofCoranone, Col. 1326;   lir. Uorrison*s statement of 1/B/U6Hansard, House of Conmone, Cols. 1213-4*).
2.     th? legal IPS it ips1.     The legal safeguards (and remedies) against the useof official information in private publications areembodied in the Official Secrets Acts of 1911 and 1920tod in the Copyright Act of 1911.    Privy Counsellorsarc, in addition, bound by their Oath.2.     In actual fact, however, it has rarely been foundpracticable to proceed against a person of seniorstanding for an unauthorised publication based onofficial information.     Sir ... Hoarorth in a Memorandumof 18th July, 1941 (file 28/2/29) quotes Jennings insupport of the vier that the effective safeguard againstthe disclosure of Cabinet proceedings and the like isneither the Oath nor the Official j ecrete Acts:&quot;The rule is primarily one of practice.    Thetheoretical basis is that a Cabinet decisionis advice to The King, whose consent isnecessary to itB publication.     Its practicalfoundation is the necessity of securing freediscussion by which a compromise can bereached, without, the risk of publicity forevery statement made and every point givenaway&quot;.

On 2nd Leeetaber 1937 the Treasury Solicitoradvised that it would he a breach of the OfficialSecrets Acts to reproduce, without authority,extracts from secret documents in a book publishedin the United Kingdom, notwithstanding that suchextracts had already been published without authorityabroad (file 28/2/1).(For the Law Officers * Opinion of 16th June. 103k.on the Property in Cabinet Documents, ana relatedpapers, see file Zi/3/Ba).Crown Coyyrlffot8.     Section 18 of the Copyright Act. 1011. reads asfollows:&quot;Without prejudice to any rights orprivileges of thv Crown, chere any work has,whether before or after the commencement ofthis Act, been prepared or published by orunder the direction or control of Hie i^ajestyor any Government Department, the copyright inthe work shall, subject to any agreement withthe author, belong to Ills Majesty, and in suchcase shall continue for a period of fiftyyears from the date of the first publication ofthe work&quot;.9.    The Controller of His Majesty&apos;s Stationery Officeis the holder, under letters patent, of Crown copyright.The Controller is the sole authority who can givepermission to make a reproduction of any Crown copyrightMaterial which without permission would be an infringe-aent, and is the sole person who can take proceedingsfor infringeraent.     (3ee letter of 3rd April, 1942,from the Controller on file 26/2.     See alsoSir N. Scorgie^ letters of July and September 19*4.6 onTreasury file E.5GO6O, in which it is stated that theController holds the copyright of both published andunpublished official documents.......-wiiw.ili-iii ......mil10.   The expression &quot;work&quot; in Section 18, quoted above,oust have the same Gleaning as in Section 1 of the Act,and accordingly includes - &quot;Every original literary,dramatic, musical and artistic work&quot;.    According tothe law fri&apos;iyate*letters are an original literary workfor purposes of copyright.     In the opinion of theLord Chancellor and the Law Officers, given on 6th July,1?33i (file 28/2), Section 18 applies to letters, bothofficial and rr^vate. written by His Majesty, includingletters written by Mis Majesty&apos;s direction.     The saiieOpinion added that, although the copyright of a letteraCdresned to the King on a matter not connected withaffairs ofvtate rested in the writer of the letter,His Majesty might take proceedings to restrain?\xblicaticr of such &amp; letter In certain circumstancese.g. if publication amounted to a breach of confidence).7The

The Copyright Act 1?11 also covers the Mapspublished by the Ordnance Survey, which ^ay not bepublished or copied (other than for private study orresearch; without permission of the Controller of theStationery Office (see circular letter of Uarch 19fcofrom the Controller on file 28/2/138).     (The Act,presumably, covers all kinds of maps, plans andsketches produced officially;.12.   In law the property of a document normally vestsin the recipient (though this does not entitle himto copy it, still less to publish it).     Ca inetdocuments, however, regain the property of the Crownthroughout their existence and are headed with thewords &quot;This Document is the Pronerty of His BritannicMajesty&apos;s Government(See Precedent Book, Part IV).(See Minute of 21st March, 193k. en &quot;The Propertyin Cabinet Documents&quot; on file PUB/3/6;   see also theconclusions of *?ar Cabinet 217 (17th August, 1917;, whichare set out in the &quot;General Historical Hotef,/.13.   The word &quot;prepared&quot; in Section 18 includes draftsof documents.   A Law Officers&apos; Opinion, dated18th June&quot; 193U (file U/3/8A) makes it clear that oncea document has bees initialled for an official purposeit becomes an official document and the property ofHis Majesty&apos;8 Government.     Thus, in regard to thepublication of official documents no distinction isdrawn between the draft and the final version.1U.   The words &quot;subject to any agrsemgnt with theuthor&quot; in Section 18 are, in the or inion of thereasury Solicitor given on 17th February, 19U8,file 28/2), intended to provide for a case in whichcivil servant, in official timed and with hisDepartment&apos;s approval, writes a book based on officialinformation, but it being in a sense personal to mmit is agreed that he should be given the copyright ofit.    He did not consider (e.g.) that Mr. Churchill&apos;spersonal minutes as Prime Minister could corns withinthe scope of what the words were meant to provide for.HttMtfcrora C9prrtBht mmm * m15.   The Treasury Solicitor has advised that &quot;theprotection given to a foreigner in respect of copyrightin the United States depends upon registration of thesubject-matter in the United States, that is to say,that unless the foreign subject registers his work inthe United States, he cannot get protection against anAmerican citizen.    Eegistration involves disclosure ofthe particular document&quot;.     As it will not normally bedesirable to disclose the contents of a British officialdocument in the United States, it will not normally bepossible to rely upon United States copyright law toprotect documents, which under English law Tould be the/subject
subject of Crown copyright, from publication in theUnited States by an American citizen.     The TreasurySolicitor suggeFtfd instead that an attest should bemade to convince such an author that British officialdocuments are the property of the British Governmentand should not be published rithout the BritishGovernments consent.16.   Under Section 1U of the Copyright Act of 1911steps however, be taken to prohibit the lrrnortinto this country of a work which infringes Britishcopyright.(See letter of 26.1jA8 on file 28/2).(See also under &quot;Reciprocal Arrangements withCommonwealth and Foreign Governments&quot;).The Privy Cotffsenor^ Oath17.   The relevant sentences of the Oath are: -&quot;I will, in all things to be moved, treatedand debated in Council, faithfully and trulydeclare ray Kind and Opinion, according to rayHeart and Conscience?   and will keep secret allmatters committed and revealed unto ne, or thatshall be treated of secretly in Council.     Andif any of the said Treaties or Counsels shalltouch any of the Ccwmsellors, I will not revealit unto him, but will keep the seme until suchtime as, by the Consent of His Majesty, or ofthe Counnil, labile at ion shall be made thereof.(Copy on file 28/2).18.   In June 1948 the King*s Private -secretaryinformed the secretary of the nabinet that the Palacehad never sought to apply a rigid rule against anydisclosure of conversations between the King and aPrivy Counsellor.    Hor did he think that it would bepracticable to bar disclosures of private conversationswith the King *hich were otherwise&quot;unobjectionablemerely on the ground that the other party to theconversation was a i.rivy Counsellor.     It would be *%different matter if the author purported to describeadvice which be had given to the King in his capacityas a Privy Counsellor.     (Bee file 28/2/101).
3.     PUBtfCATIOHS By MASTERS   Tiff.: g Q^fflCE1*     Minioters are precluded from journalism In anyform;(l)   but this prohibition does not extend toauthorship of writings of a litery, historical,scientific, philosophical or romantic character.   Horneed it debar a ainister from writing, on occasion,articles or letters to newspapers, in order tosupplement the means already used for enlightening thepublic in regard to treasures before Parliament, andother administrative questions affecting the work ofhis Department, provided that such articles do notconflict with his obligations to Parliament.     Ministersare also not debarred from contributing to thepublications of the political organisations with whichthey are associated.2. , Ministers should not accept payment for articlesof the above kinds.3.    The above rules apply to dealings with the foreignas well as the home Press.     (CP.(49) 95).(1) In a Memorandum written in 1941 Sir R. Howorthstates the considerations underlying policy onMinisterial publications as follows.     &quot;Theposition of Ministers and distinguished CrownServants in regard to publication differs fromthe position of non-official persons.     Unlikethe latter the former cannot make guesses ordraw inferences or deductions.     v/bat he writesabout in regard to official matters must beassumed to be based on first-hand knowledge andto be the truth pure and undefiled ..........He is moreover in the position of a trustee andas such it behoves him to take particular carethat he does not infringe his trust.......byadopting a partisan attitude and by placinghimself in a position where he may make aif &quot;Introductory Historical Hote&quot; datedSth Jug. 1941, on f3e 28/2/^9).

This rulin*S, presumablyon the assumption that there wouldbeno officialobjection to the publication of the book itself.5.    Greater freedom to write articles for the Press,in defence of Government policy, is nor ally allowedto Minister in times of Election, but they should notaccept payment.     (C.P.(U5) 27).For a fvller statement on this subject seePart II.
1.    Former Ministers, while they are free to writewhat they wish, provided that it contains no secretor confidential official information, are expected toexercise special discretion in view of the high officewhich they have held under the Crown.   (C.P.(U5; 27)*2.     As regards hooks by for er Ministers in which useis to be made of official documents or information,the policy adopted should be such as, on the one hand,does not interfere with the reasonable and properpurposes for which such books are written, and on theother hand, will prevent the publication of anymaterial which would be seriously detrimental to thepublic interest,3.    On the first point, Buch books are usually writtenby former Ministers to explain and justify theirpolicy while in office.    This policy may have beenthe subject of public comment and its full defence mayrequire reference to scatters which at the time had tobe regarded as secret.     When applications fromformer Ministers to use official information inpublications are being examined the following con-siderations should be borne in mind:(a) A Minister of the Crown, who isresponsible to Parliament and whoseofficial actions are properly subjectto public comment and criticism standsIn a different position,in regard towritings of the kind referred to,from Crown Servants generally, who havenot a Minister1s responsibilities.(b) To the extent that questions (e.g. ofdefence; have to be treated at the tinsthey arise with exceptional secrecythere is a case for permitting a corree-pondingly greater . .eaeure of relaxationwith regard to the , when theconsideration; (e.g. of militarysecurity; which formerly kept then secretno longer apply.h.    The concern of the Government, on the otterhand, is primarily with the effect of disclosures onfuture administration.     Here the essential point isto keep secret information of two kinds, disclosureof which would be detrimental to the public interest:-(a)   In the international sphere, informationwhose disclosure would be injurious tous in our relations with other nations,including information which would be ofvalue to a potential enemy./(b)   in12.
(bj   In the domestic sphere,(l)   informationthe publication of which would bedestructive of the confidentialrelationships on which our system ofgovernment is based and which maysubclst between Minister and Minister,Ministers and their advisers, andbetween either and outside bodies orprivate persons.     rhie means,inter alls, that reticence must beobserved as to the views advanced byindividual Liinisters or their advisers. (2)5.    A further rule of general application is that thepublication in extenso of official documents otherwisethan by the Stationery Office should only be allowedin exceptional cases;   and then only when thedocument is in some cense personal to the writer.(It should also be borne in ;:ind that secret cyphertelegrams may need to be paraphrased beforepublication).6.    The foregoing principles on the use which formerministers may make of official information in privatepublications were embodied in CP. (i*6) 188 andapproved by the Cabinet on 22nd July, 1SU6,(CM.(46) 71 at, U).Distinction between lerlocis of i eace and war7.    The principle at paragraph 3(b) above impliessome distinction in the use which may be made ofofficial information in private publications betweenperiods of peace and war.    This distinction has infact been recognised in dealing with war memoirs ofboth the 191U-18 and 1939-45 periods./8.   The(1)   ffhen these principles, as embodied in CP.(1*6) 188,were considered by the Cabinet (CM. 0+6) 71st, U)it was pointed out that the scope of paragraph (b)should not be restricted only to information inthe domestic sphere.(2)   The principle as regards confidential relationshipsis obviously not such as to admit of clear cutinterpretation in practice, and each case must beconsidered on its merits.    lie cent, importantcases where the question of disclosures likelyto be destructive of confidential relationshipsarose in an acute for.., were those of Lord Han key,Lord Heith, Lord Londonderry, Lord ChatfieIdand Mr. Francis /iUiams.
8. The strict policy adopted towards applicationsto publish poet-war Cabinet material is governed bythe decisions of the Cabinet taken in 1934 -(a) that all Cabinet documents circulatedto Minister; should be returned bythem on vacating office to theSecretary of the Cabinet (Cab.1l(34) 7);(b) that access to Cab J^je^ documents shouldnot be granted to,:non2official historical,biographical or other similar works,except where it could be shown thatpublication was desirable in order tovindicate the meuory of a deceased personwho had been injured by similarpublication in the past (Cab. 35(34) 4).9.    The less restrictive policy which had in practicebeen followed as regards Memoirs of the 1914-1B *?arwas recognised in a letter, the terms of which wereapproved by the -trine Liinister, dated 21st April, 1934*from the Secretary of the Cabinet to Mr. Lloyd-George.In this letter a distinction was in particular drawnbetween the status of a   ar Cabinet, the membership ofwhich and attendance at which was not confined toPrivy Counsellors, and that of a peace-time Cabinetwhich is normally a meeting of Privy Counsellors.The distinction between the Var and Post-war periodswas formalised In June 1938, with the approval ofthe Prime Minister, in a ruling that informationrelating to the period from the beginning of the warto 1st November 1919 (and to 24th July, 1?23, fordocuments relating to the Peace Treaties) should betreated on a different and more lenient basis thaninformation relating to subsequent periods.   (Seefile 28/2/19. Parts 1 and 2).(For a fuller statement see the &quot;GeneralHistorical Note&quot;).10.   A similar relaxation of the strict rules hadbeen accepted as applying to the period of theSecond *orld /ar (3rd September, 1939 to V.J.-day),and as covering also the central themes of defencepolicy in the years Immediately preceding the war.(C.P.(46) 188).11.   The principles to be applied in consideringapplications to publish books making use of officialinformation about the Second /orId war should bethose set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 above.(C.P.(46) 188)./12.   Under
Return of Documents by m^fff&quot;&quot;      ^&quot;^&quot;&quot;1 ^12.   Under a decision of the Prime Minister(Mr. Churchill) (ff.i.(2*5) 320), Ministers vacatingoffice in ^9k5 were permitted to retain oopies ofthe Cabinet documents r*hich they themselves vrrote;a number of Ministers availed themselves of thisright.13.   It was, however, laid down in C.P.(h6) 199 thatMinisters, on relinquishing office, return to theCabinet Office all Cabinet documents, with theexception of any immediately required for currentadministration which may be handed on to their successors.The provision for handing   on documents to a Minister&apos;ssuccessor does not apply to a change of Government.Special instructions will be issued to cover suchcases.   The above rulings were repeated in the laterconsolidation of procedural points (C.i-.(U9) 95 of20th April, 191*9).of former ministers derived from Publicationsofficial documents1k.   In reply to a Question in the House of Commonson lUth February, 11*46, on whether the Governmentintended to introduce legislation giving authority tothe State to claim 50 per cent of all earnings offormer Ministers derived from the publication of booksor newspaper articles based on official documentscollected during their term of office, the LordPresident said:   &quot;Ho, sir.     Such earnings are alreadysubject to Income Tax and, in appropriate eases, toSurtax also&quot;.statements on Resignation15*   A Minister who. on resignation, desires tojustify his action by reference in Parliament todiscussions in Cabinet must first obtain the consentof the Sovereign through the Prime Minister.(See I recedent Book, Part II).
%  - ----- --1.    The guiding principles in force in regard to theuse which nay be made, by serving and former membersof the Crown Services (i.e. in the Civil Service,the Foreign and Colonial Services and the FightingServices) of unpublished official information inprivate publications are set out in C.I.(46) 273 andwere approved by the Cabinet on 22nd July, 1^46,(C.L:.(U6) 71 st, 4).    They are as follows:hervjn^ Civil Servants, :iei:bere of the fQlfflrfffil WHForeign Services and FMfflwf Services m )(a) A Civil servant should not indulge inpolitical or party controversy.     It follows from thisthat he should not publish books or other worksdealing with matters of current political controversy,even if none of the information in the; came to him byreason of his official position;   and a x&quot;ortiori thathe should not be permitted to use official informationin such works.     It is in this respect that theposition of a civil servant is different from that ofa Minister;   since he has no public responsibility forthe policy of his Department, it is no concern of histo defend his official actions.(2)(b) Civil Servants, equally with former Ministers,should not be permitted to publish information whichit is essential to keep secret.     (For a definition ofsuch information see under former   inisters&quot;;./(c)   There(1)   The rules in force regarding disclosure ofinformation by persons in the three Services,and the arrangements for bringing to theirnotice the provisions of the Official SecretsAct, are to be found in file 28/2/36.(2)   A footnote to C.I ,(u6; 273 points out that theremay be some exceptions to this rule in the easeof certain civil servants with statutoryresponsibilities.    A further proviso is that inthe&apos; case of high military, naval and aircommanders, account must be tafc-en of the factthat such officers are personally and publiclyresponsible for the conduct of operations undertheir command, and have therefore a correspondingclaim to be allowed to publish Sefeneee of theirconduct.
(c) There may he occasions when it is not in thepnhlic interest that official information should heused in a private publication, even though it is notof the kind covered by (bj above, for the reasoneither that if the information is to be : ublished itshould be published officially oT under   officialauepicea^(l), or that it should not bt published atthe particular time proposed,(d) A considerable freedota may be allowed topublications of a specialist kind, whether byscientists, statisticians, lawyers, economists oradministrators, always provided that the first threeprinciples set out above ere not infringed.     (Seealso &quot;Payment for extra-official Activities of CrownServants&quot;. )(e)   The principles at (b), (c) and (d) applyec^ually to retired civil servants.     Objection neednot however be taken to a book by a former civilservant on matters of political controversy, providedthat no unpublished official Information was used andthat the matters dealt with were not those which hehad himself handles.      Nevertheless, it would normallybe thought contrary to the traditions of the Serviceand dangerous to its reputation for impartiality ifon retirement a career civil servant were to publishanything except the most restrained and objectivecriticism of the Governmentswhich he had served, andthe Government would certainly be within its rightsin refusing permission to use official information inony book by a retired civil servant which dealt withmatters of political controversy.(1) Treasury Circular 12/33 (copy on file L.271)suggests a distinction between a work, thematerials of which have been supplied byunpublished official documents prepared at thecost of the State, and a work which owes itsvalue exclusively to the ability and researchof its author.      In the first ease considerationshould be given to the publication of theproposed book by the Stationery Office, theauthor receiving such payment as may be agreedwith him with the consent of the Treasury (see&quot;Payments for extra-official activities ofCrown servants);   and if it is decided that itis more appropriate that the book should bepublished by an outside publisher, the Serviceis nevertheless entitled to be supplied withsuch copies as may be required for its use ata raoderate cost.     In the second case, theabove considerations do not apply./(f)
(f)   Temporary civil servants, on leaving theGovernment Service, may resume the full liberty ofexpression of their views on political matters,provided that they make no use of unpublished officialinformation.     Such additional obligations ofreticence which rest In this matter on retired careercivil servants, by comparison with retired temporarycivil servants, are not such as to be capable offormal definition.ttaaa ^nv9 waft(g)   The principles in (e) and (f) above applyequally to former members of the Foreign Service;   and,inasmuch as the ultimate sanction for these principlesis the official Secrets Acts, to former members of theFighting Services also.     But the tradition of silenceon official matters does not, in the Fighting Services,extend to former riembers, so that in their case thereis even less possibility of taking objection to a workpraising or blaming the Governments in power duringthe period of the authors service.(Special rulee were foroulated in 1942, but havesince lapsed, on the publication of memoirs by Officersof the Fighting Services who held important appointmentsduring the war.     See the appended &quot;General HistoricalNote&quot;, which also describes the procedure adopted forhandling official war despatches by Commanders-in-Chief.)(h)   Although the principles outlined above havenecessarily been set out chiefly in the form ofrestrictions on the liberty of serving and formerCrown servants, it is not intended that the resultingpolicy should be a restrictive one;   on the contrary,as the area of Government activity widens to covermore and more matters formerly outside official scope,there should be increasing opportunity for Crownservants to write useful works on subjects which nowfall within the scope of their own or other Crownservants1 official duties;   and, within the limitsindicated above, there seems to be every reason toencourage rather than restrict such a development(C.l&apos;.(46) 273).lavoent for ^xtra-Officlal Activities of Crown Servants2.

Work done substantially in official tlflg isofficial duty and is covered by normal salary.Specific payment for an extra-official activityInvolving some use of official time may, however, beJustified (a) if the amount of official time involvedis small and is either made up otherwise or treatedas time off without pay;   (b) if the activityproduces something of outstanding value, or for otherreasons may be treated exceptionally (subject tospecific Treasury authority).U.    The payment which a Crown servant receives froman outside source for an extra-official activityshould not be restricted in any way by his Departmenton the sole ground that official information and/orexperience have been involved.If, however, the Government wishes to acquireor take over the work, the officer should have nothat decision.     Payments by Governmentto Crown servants, over and above normalfor activities outside the scope of theirduties and involving no use of official time, shouldbe calculated on the same basis as if they werepayments to persons outside the public service for thesame activity.    As public criticism might be arousedif such extra remuneration to an official wereLderable, where a Government Department proposes toextra remuneration exceeding 2250 in any calendaryear to any Crown servant, whether it be a singlepayment or the total of several, specific Treasurystion is required.(The above Circular (T.C. 9/U8) abolishes theupper limit on annual salary plus extra remunerationprescribed by the Treasury Liinute of 19th March, 1890.It also supersedes establishment Officers CircularsNo. U96 (1st July, 1941) and 631 (30th December, 1942)relating to broadcasts.     It does not supersedeTreasury Circular 12/33 on books and other publications^(tec  Ck,g, fiora.S),
1.    The question of the extent to which writers ofmemoirs and similar works should he permitted to quotefrom or reproduce unpublished official documents wasreferred to in memoranda submitted to and approved bythe Cabinet in 19U6 in the following terms:-(a) the publication in extenso ofofficial documents otherwise than bythe Stationery Office should beallowed only in jCvery exceptionaland then only when the document is insome sense personal to the writer&quot;(C.P.(M6) 188. paragraph 11).(b) this /&quot;i.e. Government discretionas to use.y applies to the publication incxtenso of official documents, includingminutes and memoranda written by civilservants in their official capacity, whichshould normally be published, if at all,by the Stationery Office (C.F.(U6) 273,2.    The Committees on the Use of Official Informati.in Private publications, in September consideredwhat circumstances should be taken to constitute anexceptional ajse as envisaged by the quotation atparagraph (a; above, with the object of ensuring thatall Departments which handle such cases follow, as faras ]oeBible,^consistent policy.    A number of pointsJKLa^J!d X*! **2&quot;&amp;$*!!2**&quot; a KUide to Departments.These points, which the Committee recognised to be byno cane exhaustive, were as follows.     (in each ofthe.i it is assumed that publication has not alreadybeen ruled out on other grounds - e.g. that the subjectmatter is confidential;. *^(a)   The general distinction between those whoare publicly responsible for policyi.e. Ministers) and those who are not(most other Crown Servants) should apply(b)   The documents must always be in a realsense personal to the person who wishesto publish them.     It is not, forinstance, sufficient that he wrote ordrafted them.(e)   Documents which are in the nature ofletters of appoint sent and resignation,directives to commanders etc. are likelyto be of a kind which can be publishedor quoted by the person to whom theyrelate./(d) JBeports
(d) Report8 or despatches by Ambassadors,service commanders and others, which areof a purely factual nature, are likelyto be of e kind of which publication orquotation by the authors may be permitted,though there may be cases where permissionshould be refused, e.g. on the groundthat the report should be publishedofficially or not at all, or in a casewhere the quotation of part of a reportwhich the Government had decided not topublish might precipitate a demand forthe publication of the whole.     It shouldnot, indeed, be taken as a general rulethat reports of a purely factual natureare for that reason necessarily suitablefor quotation or publication by theauthors.(e) A sufficient reason for refusing permissionmay be that the Government itself is aboutto publish the document in some officialseries, such as the series of diplomaticdocumente, published from tine to time bythe Foreign&quot; Gffice.     On the other handit might equally be a reason that theGovernment had published a series in whichthe document in question might haveappeared, but had deliberately decided toexclude it.(f) Documents which are of the nature of minutesor memoranda containing advice to Ministersshould never be quoted or published.(CLP.(46) 2 and 0.1.P.(46) 1st Meeting, Minute 2copies on file 28/2/78).ution of Tell3.

7.     ACCESS TO OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS BY fflflflff1.    The Committee on the Lee of Official Informationin Private Publications on 2*,th September, U46, agreedon the adoption of a common policy by Departmentstowards applications by private persons for access toofficial documents, as follows:-(a) It is the acknowledged right of formerMinisters of Cabinet rank to have access to the Cabinetdocuments of the period durin;; which they held office.(b) This right also extends to former JuniorMinisters, limited, however, to the documents whichthey saw or could have seen while in Office.* k- (c)   The principles in (a) and (h) apply also todepartmental documents asked for by ex-Ministers andformer Junior Ministers.(d) Departments should grant access only to theirown documents, and where documents of anotherDepartment are Involved should either refer theapplicant to that Department, or obtain its concurrence,as seems appropriate.(e) Crown servants other than Ministers have noright of access to documents after they have left theService, but permission may be granted exceptionallyon the merits of the case, e.g. if the personconcerned has held a position of responsibilitycomparable to that of a Minister, or If the Governmentitself is interested In facilitating the proposedprivate publication.(f) Persons who apply for access as therepresentatives  i.e. agents or personal assistants^of former Ministers should be given permission onlyexceptionally, as a matter of courtesy to the formerMinister.(k)   Persons /&quot;i.e. other than persons at (f)above./ who have never been in the Crown Service, orwhose application is unconnected with their Crownservice should normally be refused access(l) (butsee under &quot;Vindicators&quot; below).(h)   ffherettTpossible, especially in border linecases which way prove troublesome, the atteipt shouldbe made to persuade the applicant to accept insteadan offer to correct any inaccuracies of fact in hismanuscript.(See 0.1.P.(46) 4 and O.I.p.(46) 1st Meeting,inute 5, copies of which are on file 28/2/77)./2.   An(1) On the question of access to documents bystudents preparing theses for Universitydegrees, see file 70/35/2.
2.    An exception to the rule at (g) above has formerlybeen recognised, though it is not specifically referredto in the Committee^ rules.    This is the case wherea relative or litenfvexecutor of a deceased ex-Ministermake8 good a claim that access to certain officialdocuments is necessary so that information or quotationsmay be taken from then, for inclusion in a work designedto vindicate the memory of the ex-Minister byjustifying his policies, judgment, etc., which havebeen publicly criticised.of Independent Histories and Other --r+tjnraIn December, 1939* the -iar Cabinet decided:-&quot;That all Departments should adhere to thegeneral practice adopted in the Great ?varin this matter, namely that specialfacilities should not be accorded to personsengaged in writing unofficial histories ofthe war&quot;.     (W.M. 122(39) 3, 22nd December,1939).U.     In August 1946 the Cabinet Office and theDepartiuents concerned agreed upon an amplification ofthis ruling to the effect that access to unpublishedofficial material may be given only to: -(a) Authors engaged in writing historiesor books sponsored by the Government;and(b) Unit historians approved by their Colonelor Colonel Commandant (or appropriateNaval or Air Force Officer) as theaccredited historians of the units,and writing for private circulationonly within the unit.It is for Service Departments to determine to whatparticular documents authors in the above categoriesshould be given access.5.     Access to unpublished official material shouldnot be given, in any form, to any authors other thanthose referred to in (a) and (b) above, except onlythat the Air Ministry *ay, in their discretion.available, for the purposes of the biography or auto-biography of a pilot, copies of combat reports by thatpilot.    It is, however, within the discretion of theService Departments, where they consider that a usefulpurpose would be served thereby and where it isadministratively possible, to answer questions orgive guidance to any author or writer on specificpoints, or to check material submitted to then by anyauthor or writer./6.    A
6.    A departure from the above procedure may be madeonly where the circumstances are exceptional and byprior agreement between the Service Departments andthe Cabinet Offices.7.    The heads of the responsible sections of theService Departments meet, from time to time, in orderto ensure that they are, so far as possible, followingthe same practice in this matter.8.    The foregoing rules do not affect the position ofaccredited historians of Dominion or Allied Governments,to whom special considerations apply.(See, generally, file 70/35; see also the&quot;General Historical Kote&quot; for an account of thebackground of this ruling).2f

The most recent public statement on procedure isthat given in the House of Commons on 1st August, 1fA6,by the Lord ; resident of the Council, who explainedthat &quot;Former Ministers who w^sh to make use of such7&quot;l.e. unpublished official 7 information should applyto the Secretary of the Cabinet, who will consult anyDepartment concerned and submit the matter to ......the Prime Minister&quot;.

TheSecretary of the Cabinet will, in dealing withproposal8 involving the disclosure of Cabinet pro-ceedings follow the procedure described in paragraph 5above.12.   The Treasury is the central point for handlingquestions of procedure in the use of officialinformation in private publications.   (The inter-departmental Committee (O.I.P.) which was set up forthis purpose in 1S46, when policy was reviewed bythe Cabinet, was allowed to lapse in 1949).Departments in doubt as to procedure should thereforeconsult the Treasury, the responsible officer beingthe head of the Establishments General Division.(See letters of 18/7/1949 sad 3/8/1949 on file 28/2B).Author 1 rf.% X onfor the TerT13.

1.     A statement drawn up at the Imperial Conferenceof 1923, although it was not putoliahed in theproceedings of the Conference at the time, has beenaccepted by all parties as governing the publicationof official information.     It provides that theconsent of all Governments interested must be obtainedbefore any papers or communications are made publicwhich were marked at the time of despatch to be of aconfidential or secret nature or were transmitted inconfidential or secret despatches.(1)     (see file28/2/3U).United ctates Government2.

This note describes the use which ex-ministersand others hare in the past made of Cabinet and C.I.D.documents and other confidential official material inprivate publications, with or without officialpermission.     It also describee the development ofrules for the custody of and access to Cabinet andC.I.D. documents and the development of policy on theuse of official information in private   ublieations.Ptftrt ivk2.

The habit of publishing reminiscenceswas not then anything like aa common as it is now, eatwhile many persons, including distinguished statesmanand Servants of the Crown, kept diaries etc, if theycontemplated their publication at all. it would be bytheir literary representative6 after their deaths andnot in their own lifetime.

Clearlyeuch material could not properly be used by a biographeror autobiographer before the   ublie generally bad aeoeeato the Material at the accord   ffice.    Moreover, allCabinet proceeding and suchlike aeeret natters seretreated^wlth^ secrecy, ^reveand respect in^ ^Victorian age *km    &quot;The writing of articles in the ireee or ofautobiographies dealing with secret official mattersby persons holding, or who had held, high officialpositions would, in the absence of very exceptionalcircu istances, have been regarded as anomalous sad si meatas indecent.5.    &quot;iTior to the passage into law of the first OfficialLecrets Act in 1911 there was no effective legalsanction against Improper publication of secret officialinforciation, but : rivy Coaasellors were bouse by theirOath.(l)6.    In the case of Civil and other Crown Servantsthere was the dee; ly ingrained tradition that silencein regard to official work was golden and ust bepreserved, and that to publish reminiscences dealingwith official life and matters would be a breach ofwell-established professional tradition and etiquette.Ministers, ex-ministers and Crown Servants alike warsall regarded as occupying fiduciary positions sad thewell kno/n legal maxim that a trustee mast never makea profit out of his Trust was generally accepted andacted upon&quot;.7.    Before 191U it was the practice for CabinetMinisters on leaving office to retain their copies ofCabinet documents.    This practice e tended also tothe C.I.D. until 2nd December, 19CU when it was decided -(a) that members of the Cabinet should retaintheir files;(b) that naval and military n*esters shouldtransfer their papers to their successorsIn office./8.

These rules werestill in force in 1:23, and the Secretary of theCabinet, in s He ioranouu on the subject, dated2kth rebruary, 1928, reported that the office had haduSisters^on leaving cfficoT^be^addod^^ex-liinisters had taken full advantage of the ruleregarding access to documents:   e.g. Lord Halfour,Mr. Asculth, ana (after Lord Lansdowne,Lord Crowe, Mr.   inaton Churchill andMr. Aasten Charaberlaia.    This rule had normally beeninterpreted as giving foruer ..edbers of the C.I.D.the right to call st the offices of the Caaaittec toconsult the documents.      xcci tionel^ doctaaente hadbeen sent out of the office on loan. &apos;1^1to-1 *?109.

As a result of this decision Mr. Arthur Hendersonreturned all his documents;   Mr. Austen Chamberlainhanded over most of his documents to his successorat the India Office, returning the remainder; there-after the Cabinet Secretariat did their utmost toensure tliat Cabinet documents were either handed overto Ministers&apos; successors or returned.    Neverthelessex-Ministers usually insisted on retaining copies ofmemoranda written by themselves.13.   .&apos;nen the flar Cabinet came to an end the Cabinetwas re constituted on a peace system, and at itsfirst meeting on 4th November, 1919, laid downinstructions to the Secretary on Cabinet procedure.A proposal by the Secretary that the practice of the(Yar Cabinet in regard to the return of documentsshould be continued was not accepted;   instead, areturn was luade to the pre-war practice.     The Cabinetwas satisfied that 6ecrecy was safeguarded by the rulethat nobody was entitled to make public use of Cabinetdocuments without the permission of the King.    TheOffice of the Cabinet and C.I.D. remained responsible,however, for the collection of C.I.D. documents,and continued, also, to do their best to recover /arCabinet documents, though with varying success.14.   The rule laid down by the tfar Cabinet on accessto documents by ex-Ministers was continued by theCabinet of November 1S-19 and by the new Government of1^22.     In the early post-war years no very greatuse was made of this right, except by Mr. Lloyd Georgewhose assistant, an Army officer, was given access tothe relevant documents on his behalf in the CabinetOffice and waa allowed to take notes, but not to takecopies or to remove documents./15.

On 15th March, 1923, the I rime Minister was askedin the House of Commons whether he had given furtherconsideration to the subject of the sale by ex-CabinetMinisters of confidential information acquired duringtheir period of office;   and, if so, whether a decisionhad been reached to take such steps as would put a stopto the publication of information of this nature until/15 years(1) Cabinet 11(23) 4-

The replywas to the effect that L.r. Churchill had not been givenaccess to official documents at the Admiralty;   butthat he had been given copies of so le of bis eonofficial minutes and of Admiralty orders or telegramsbased on or leading up to these minutes by the authorityof the First Lord of the Admiralty.    On the last partof the rueetion it was pointed out that the reproductionof official documents in the book was not thoughtliJ-xly to add materially to its celling value and noprovision had therefore been made for a proportion ofthe proceeds to go to the Exchequer.20.

Neglect of the procedure for obtaining officialconcent to publication had undoubtedly bean facilitatedby the fact that many farmer -inletera and highofficials had retained official documents in theirpeaeeaolon.     In 193U and 1935 it began to be felt thatthe tine bad come to Institute a stricter control overthe retention of Cabinet documents by perecce no longerin official positions, and to impose more ri^idrestrictions on the use of such notarial in publishedeorke.    Thia was reflected in the decisions of theCabinet -(s)   That all Cabinet documents circulated toMinisters should be returned by the , onvacating office, to the Secretary of theCabinet.

(Sir      Howorth&apos;sMfntinslw i of 18th July, 1941. on file 26/2/29).31*   There thus grew up in practice a distinctionbetween the policy ado- ted towards information re latins;to the i*rlod of the war one that relating to thepost-war period.     -his vae recognised in a letter, theUnsj or etttfc v/ei* a.. x-oved by the   rim mfmimhol.dated 21st April, 193U, fron the Secretary of the Cabinetto Mr.   ioyd George.

35.   In the years of international tension preceding theoutbreak of war in 1939 and in tht critical years of thewar itself, the importance of avoid in - public controversyand recrimination on such issues as the Versaillespeace settlement and rearmament policy reinforced theneeo to adhere firmly to the strict rules laid down bythe Cabinet in 1934.     Thus, in 1941, Lord ChatfieId wasrefused permission to publish that part of his me sirswhich dealt with his years as First Sea Lord and asMinister, and in which he severely criticised all thosewho had stood in the way of rearmament.     The reasongiven to Lord Chatfleld was that &quot;the publication atthis time of the second part of your Memoirs would becalculated to arouse controversy and to lead to someweakening of the sense of national unity, and thusimpede our war effort &quot;(letter of 28/11/41 on file28/2/29).     Similar considerations arose in respectof Lord Londonderry&apos;s book,   ings of Destiny, consideredin 1942;   but he agreed to make the substantialalterations to the text which were required, and in itsmodified form the book was approved for publication.Another related case was that of Lord Cork and Orrery,who, early in 1942, sought permission to include in hisrae oirs an account of his experiences as Corxmndei&apos;-in-Chief at Narvik.     This account would almost certainlyhave aroused controversy over the conduct of theNorwegian campaign, and the application led to a Cabinetdecision (referred to later in this hote) &quot;that Officersof the three Services should not publish reminiscencesof the present war while the war continued&quot;(*V&apos;.h. 43(42) 5).     Accordingly, permission was alsowithheld from Lord (then Sir Hugh) Dowding, who inOctober 1S42 wished to publish a book of memoirs calledTwelve Legjone of Angels.36.   In these years a number of other cases of someinterest were dealt with.     In 1941 applications by oron behalf of biographers of Lord Craigavon andMr. Neville Chamberlain to have access to Cabinet andother documents were turned down, there being noquestion of &quot;vindication&apos; in these cases;   but in thelatter case the biographer (Mr. Keith Felling)compiled his book from personal diaries and letters,sad subject to modifications requested by the CabinetOffice in 1945 to avoid reference to proceedings inCabinet and the disclosure of confidential communicationsbetween Ministers, he was allowed to publish it.     Incontrast, Mr. David Ogg, who was writing a biography ofH.A.L. Fisher, was allowed access to a number of Cabinetpapers circulated by Mr. Fisher as Minister ofEducation in 1917-18, on the grounds that the paperswere not of particular secrecy, that it was fortuitousthat they were not in Lr. hisher&apos;s collection of papers,and that Mr. Ogg wss a distinguished historian.37.   More controversial was the application of LordHankey, in September, 1$43* to publish his memolrB ofthe 191U-18 period.     This book was held to be open toserious objection on the grounds that it was compiledlargely fro ; a private diary keptby Lord Kankey while/secretary

Lord Hsnkey was unwilling to asks the drasticalterations to the text which would have been necessaryto overcome these objections, and the Cabinet decidedin January 1945 to refuse permission for publication.The matter was considered again by Ministers in i$b&amp;t butthe original decision was u held.    Similar in characterwas the application made in nevember Mh5 bylord Vansittart to be allowed to publish lie oranda onpolicy towards Qermany which he had written in 1937 asPermanent Undersecretary at the Foreign Office;   thisrequest wss also refused.he Deoisio s of 1 .4*638.   In the consideration of Lord Chatfield&apos;s Memoirsin 11U1, it had been explicitly recognised that thefaci that publication of part of the js oirs could notbe authorised at that tine was not to be taken asprejudring the issue whether, and if so to what extent,the rules about publication of confidential matterswould have eventually to be relaxed is res ect of thewar and the years immediately preceding it.     In 1r45tir. rshurchlll ruled that - inisters of his Administrationon vacating office right retain copies of Cabinetdocuments written by themselves ( /.! .(k5) 320).    In19U6 s further application by Lord Chatfiold to beallowed to publish a revised version of the second halfof his memoirs led in due course to a review of   olicy,and the Cabinet approved recommendations contained ina ,.e.orandum by the Cabinet Office (Ci.(2t6; 188).This proposed a relaxation of the strict rules forbooks by ex-iiinisters relating to the war period(3rd September ^939 to V.J-day; and the central the ;cbof defence policy in the years i-^mediately preceding thewar.    The policies laid down in this paper, and in alater paper (C.: .(U6; 273; on publications by otherCrown Servants, which waa stftexwred by the Cabinet, areset out in the relevant chapters of iart VIII, and neednot be further discussed here.39.   This general revision of policy led to theestablishment in the same year of a co Kit tee ofofficials from the Departments principally concerned,under the Chairmanship of the lernnneat Secretary ofthe Treasury.    This Committee on the Use of OfficialInformation In Private lubllcationa, as it was called,consisted of representatives of the Treasury,Stationery Office, Admiralty, ministry of labour,ar Office, Foreign Office.

After Lord Baldwin&apos;s death a new situationcreated, since Mr. Young thereupon ceased to besad became an ordinary biographer.    In replyuiries made in January 1948, Mr. Young statedthat he waa proposing to proceed with the biography.but that he had found very little suitable materialamong the Cabinet records which waa not also availableto him from other sources, and that in the circumstancesthe reader of the book would not be able to infer thathe had had access to the Cabinet records.     In anythe book for official scrutiny before publication.43.   Two, recent unauthorised publications should herebe mentionee.     Sir James Origg, although he had in1946 inquired about and been info - cin 1948 allowed extractsto appear in the &quot;Daily Telegraph,without further consultation with the Office&apos;.    itrepresented to sir James Origg that it was, even at solate a stage, still advisable for him to submit hisbut he did not subsequently do so.     In September 1948Mr. Francis Williams, until recently public relationsadviser to the J rime Minister, published a book&quot;The Triple Challenge&quot; which, although aaataM use ofno official material which was notportrayed ministers in s way whichinfringing the confidential relationshipiiinisters and their official advisers.44.   Authoritative writers on constitutional lav andpractice and similar subjects have on occasion beengiven assistance by the Office.    Thus, In 1931,Mr. Lawson, the editor of Halsbury&apos;s Lays of ^ llffl.;iven a certain amount o   inion matters of fact when preparing a revised editionof this work.    In 1936 Dr. (now Sir Ivor) Jenningswas given assistance on points of fact la thepreparation of his Cabinet Govern-ae-nt. centDr. *ade was given advice in the revision in 1948 ofhis and Mr. Phillips&apos; &quot;fflHitltBtlona] Law- sad in 1949Sir Ivor Jennings aaa assisted in   he revision of hisof distinct, but related, topics regainin the paragraphs which follow.45.  During and after the 1914-18 war the only facilitiesgranted by the Historical Section of the Committee ofImperial Defence, except to the writers of the Officiallstory of the   ar, were that authorised historiansof units and divisions were allowed to consult the warDiaries.    It appears, however, that individual ServiceDepart; ents say sometimes have given in for stlon andassistance to Independent authors.A6.    The

After the war (January 1945) the Committee for theControl of Official Histories give consideration to thequestion whether the same ruling should continue toapply toall applications from anofficial historians.It was recognised that any policy laid down should bei could hold good for several years, until thehistories were largely if not entirely48.

In(1)   The official Service histories of the 193ear, the writers of which were accorded fullaccess to official documents, were not likelyto be completed for many years.    But thesehietor.ee were to be preceded by a series ofpreliminary official histories of a sore popularmature, the authors of which were to have aeeeefto Many official documents, though not at firstto those of the highest degree of
30.   In August 1946 agreement was reached en a rulingto the effect that access to unpublished officialmaterial would be given only (a) to authors engagedin writing histories or books sponsored by theGovernment;   (b) to unit historians approved by theirColonel or Colonel Commandant (or appropriate liavalor Air Force Officer) as the accredited historians ofthe units, and writing for private circulation onlywithin the unit;   and (s) exceptionally at thediscretion of the Air Ministry to -.A.F. pilots ortheir biographers, who night be shown copies of theirco bat reports.51.   In addition, Service Departments were givendiscretion to answer questions or give guidance to anauthor or to cheek material submitted by an author.(See, further, under &quot;Current : rocedurew and,generally, on file 70/35).52.   At their - eating on 7th April, 19421 the forLaid down a general rule that *0ffHrvices should not publishwar while the war continued&quot;,this rule.     (tf.M.(42) 43rd Conclusions,5).53.   Although their decision was In w.^,ar Cabinet had primarily in mind the publicationmemoirs by Officers who had held important appointduring the war.    The Service ministers, thereforeI to interpret the Cabinet^ decision in I**hllet there is no general objectionsubject to the usual departmental safeguardsto the publication, during the war, oi relating to the exploitsof personnel of the threepermission will In practice be withheld fromrequests from Officers who have held importantappointments during the war to include inetc.,m the end of twoof war, or earlier if necessary, thematter will be submitted for furtherin the light of experience andthen prevailing&quot;. (July 1942).54.   The Service Departments were led to this inter-p re tat ion by the difficulty of drawing a dividing lineSenior Officers whose re minxscnets could notand Junior OfficersS dion rani: or appoint ei.-;   and itthat in any event it weulm be invidious to/absolute
absolute ban on the Senior officers which waa notapplicable in any form to the Junior   ffieers.    TheEepartnents felt that the embargo on refer neea to theconduct of operations or viewa on najor uectione ofpolicy woulc be enough to deter an Officer who had heldat all during the war,55.   As regards enforcement, the Service Departnentapointed out that, while no difficulty arena ee regardsserving Officers, they had only United powers overff leers no longer serving and none at all overOfficere who have severed their connection with theService.     bile the Official Gecrets Act might prove ssufficient deterrent, it was recognised that therecould be no guarantee that officers no longer servingwould not publish unauthorised asmolre which, thoughnot warranting a prosecution under the Official accreteAct, would have been held to be barred by the new rulesif permission for publication had been swiftiT56.   Further correspondence took place la Bovember I9h5between the ierraonent ; ecrotary to the Admiralty endthe Secretary of the Cabinet in which It was agreed thatthe ban Imposed by/ the war Cabinet in April v42 mightbe regarded as having lapsed with the end of aba war,and that the procedure the three Services were aenptlngfor securing that no official material van publishedwithout authority was adequate,   (rile 28/2/36).57.   Although the war despatches of Comaanders-in-Chiefare published officially and are in no sense &apos;Privatepublications&apos;, the responsibilities of the Cabinetoffice in relation to tana naj to roue extent similarto those concocted with the scrutiny of war memoirs,and this development of the procedure ia thereforedealt with here, ae a natter of convenience.58.   In answer to iarliaaentary  u stiona in 19**3 and19hh the Prime Minister (and the Deputy irime Minister;stated that the despatches of Ccmunnders-in-Chief onwar operations would not be published until this couldbe done without giving useful Information to the enemy.An undertsking was however given that the despatebenwould be published after the war.     (See Hansard,House of Commons for 1.6.U3. cols. 21-22;   for 2B.3.hh,cols. 12U0-12U2;   etc .59.   In January 1:46 the I rime Minister a. rovedcertain recou sendationo on procedure agreed betweenthe Admiralty, war Office, Air -iniatry.

In February 1946 the Chiefs of Staff set up aworking party of representatives of the ServicePc nrtaents to exarine the contents ofto check security points.    Anlikely to have i^or   ar Office interest itthat ...0.1 of the  ar Office should undertake the&quot;preparation for publication of all despatches of aninter-service nature and should clear them with allDepartments concerned in the United Kingdom on behalf ofthe Chiefs of staff.61.   in May 1946 the service Ministers were notifiedthat the  rise   inister had agreed that Mr.be given the opportunity of seeing andtocarried out during his Premierehipj^they iproofs of such deapatohes to the Secretary of theCabinet so that he could submit them to r.

62.   When the Ministry of Defence was established as aseparate Ministry, the Prime Minister decided(January 1947) that the final authority for thepublication of despatches should remain with thePrime Minister.63. The procedure for handling despatches, as finallyevolved  jas as follows:(a)   Despatches by Supreme Allied Commanderswhere these are British:(i)   Author sends despatch to /ar Office(M.0.1 (Despatches)).(ii)   M.0.1 (Despatches) clear the despatchon behalf of the Chiefs of Staffwith all Departments concerned inthe United Kingdom, including theHistorical Section of the CabinetOffice.     Any amendments are putin the form of a note by the War Officeto the Chiefs of Staff.(iii)   When approved by the Chiefs of Staffthe amendments are submitted bythe Ministry of Defence to theauthor.(iv)   When the author agrees to the amendmentsthey are incorporated in the despatchwhich 1b then sent through the JointStaff Mission,  Washington, for thecomments of the United Statesauthorities.(v)   Any amendments suggested by the UnitedStates authorities are submitted tothe Chiefs of staff for apiroval.(vi)   When the Chiefs of Staff have finallyapproved the despatch, proofs arethen sent to Mr. Churchill by theinistry of Defence, through theSecretary of the Cabinet.(vii)   When iir.

In 1f44 consideration ess given to the questionof the degree of freedom to be allowed to economists,historians, seientists etc, in Govern, ent Service topublish books and articles on their special subjecta.The question was of particular importance to thetemporary Civil Servant who would return to Universitylife when the war was over and whose academic standingmight be impaired if he were unable in the noontime togive published evidence of hie capacity.    Again, inthe ease of those whom it was hoped to retain in theService after the war, their decision to stay or toleave was likely to tnsa largely on whether they wouldbe per it fed, subject to the obvious and necessaryrestraints, is  ublish worlds which would keep theirna.es in circulation in the acadeuic world.    It wasgenerally accepted that, subject to the general ruleprohibiting civil servants from engaging in politicalcontroversy and subject also to their being nodisclosure of official information contrary to thepublic interest, the attitude towards publications bya civil servant on matters of which he hot specialknowledge should be encouraging rather than restrictive.This was reflected in C.i.
