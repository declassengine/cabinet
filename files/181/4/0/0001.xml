They are likewise responsible for advisingon questions concerning the specific limitations on theactivities of Ministers (including the holding of director-ships and shareholding).The Treasury are responsible for the administrationof the various statutory provisions affecting Ministers(including Ministers salaries).    They are also primarilyresponsible for matters connected with official residences,official cars, etc.Hevertfceless, while the Cabinet office do not haresay particular responsibility in these matters, they areoften consulted upon them.   The general understanding isthat the Cabinet Office should not advise on those mattersvluch are the special concern of No. 10 Downing Street,unless the question Involved comes clearly within thescope of well established rulings or cau be met by referenceto a particular passsgs in the circulated notes on procedure.Vthere more than a straightforward enquiry is involved thematter should be referred to No.10, Downing Street.The definition of the extent to which theCabinet Office should handle matters connected withPress articles and Press interviews, Ministerialbroadcasts and speeches, and the holding of director-ships by Ministers was agreed with the PrimeMinister1s Private Secretary In November, 1942.Pile Vl/23.
The choice of a Prime Minister by the King is not utada onformal advice or submission.     In many cases the choice is clear,but the King has an absolute right in all cases to consultanyone he pleases.     This right may be of the greatest valuein cases where there is doubt about the choice, e.g. in theevent of the death of a Prime Minister in office, theresignation of the Prime Minister for personal reasons, acomplicated political situation, etc.     Nevertheless, asthe r,ing should not exercise, or appear to exercise, anypolitical bias, he would normally choose as Prime Ministerthe leader of the Party having the largest number of seatsin the House or Commons;   and he would make his choicein a clear case of this kind without any overt orpersonal consultations, as such consultations might implypersonal partisanship.    Ho Peer has been chosen as PrimeMinister since the end of x,ord Salisbury &apos;s administrationin 1902See Jennings, pp. 20-1*6;   Anson Vol.11(1), PP. 13^-131, 143;   10, Downing StreetHandbook, paras. 2-3*Per notes on the constitutional positionof the Prime Minister as Minister of Defence(1940-4*5) end on the use of the expressions&quot;Prime Minister of the United Kingdom&quot;,&quot;Prime Minister of Great Britain&quot;, etc. see PileThe Prime Minister chooses the other members of hisadministration and recommends their appointment to the Kingon his own responsibility though he may ,nako suchconsuitati ns as he things fit.     It is not constitutionallynecessary that a Minister should be a peer or a member of theMouse of Commons on appointment, exceptions noted inJennings, p. 48 and 10, Downing utreet Handbook, para 4.There are certain statutory and conventional limitationson the choice of the Prime Minister in forming his administrationparticularly on the number of Ministers who may sit in thehouse of Jo . .ons.See Jennings, pp. 47-63; 10, Downing 9treetHandbook, paras. 4-8.Por a suin..iary note of the aain Actsaffecting the numbers, salaries, etc. ofMinisters see   Annex.The formalities of swearing in, changingseals, etc. are arranged by the Clerk of thePrivy council direct with the Paleoe and wltbMinisters.For papers dealing with the Prerogativepower to appoint new Ministers, and theformula to be adopted in Bills providing for theappointment of new Ministers see Pile 4/1/39*

In substance, however, the FrinoMinister nakes the appointment, in consultation with the Ministerconcerned   It is not constitutionally necessary for the namesof Junior Ministers to be submitted to the King, but this iscustomarily done.See further paragraph 28 belaw.
w Apffice k&quot;nt      &quot;iQistero*   Consequential Action by the CabinetThe Secretary of the Cabinet may on occasion be consultedby the Prime Minister&apos;s Private Secretary on the terms of thePress statement to be issued on the appointment of a newMinister, particularly if a Minister without Portfolio is beingappointed and it is desired in the statement to give someindication of his duties or to make some general reference tohis position in relation to the central machinery of Government.&amp;- When the Minister*s appointment has been announced thefollowing action by the Cabinet Office is re quired:-(a) to consider and, after such consultation as may benecessary (e.g. with the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury,or with a Senior Minister) of which Cabinet Committees heshould be made a member, and to make a submission accordinglyto the Prime Minister.    If he is succeeding a Minister incharge of a Department, he will normally take his place on thoseCabinet Cbmnifctees of which his predecessor was a member, but thelatter may have been a member of certain Committees in apersonal capacity.     See generally Part III.(b) to take the Prime Minister&apos;e   instructions on theprecedence to be accorded to him, if the Prime Minister hasnot already given a ruling.     See Part I, p(c) to add him name, as appropriate to circulation lists&apos;    for Cabinet and Cabinet Committee documents.     See Part V.(d) to arrange for him to be provided with tbe appropriateCabinet keys.    See(e) to revise the Cabinet Office list of Ministers.See Part I, p.(f) to send him through hie Private Secretary a copyof the current notes on procedure (CP. (49)95), wltb copiesof the notes there referred to.(g) if appropriate, to confirm in due course that hebas taken over the Cabinet documents issued to his predecessor.7On the appointment to the Cabinet of someone who has not-  previously held Ministerial office it is customary for theSecretary of tbe Cabinet to call upon him, to give himpersonally a copy of the notes on procedure and to handhim the agenda and papers for the first meeting of the Cabinetwhich he is to attend.    This action may, however, not benecessary if the new member of the Cabinet is in charge ofa Department.aThe Cabinet Office is not responsible for the provisionof office accommodation for Ministers without Portfolio norfor finding them suitable staff, including Private Secretaries,but may be consulted by the Treasury, particularly on thefunctions to be exercised by the new Minister and the staffwhich he is likely to need.    Provision of red Cabinet boxesis th  responsibility of the Department concerned or, in thecase of Ministers without Portfolio, of tbe Treasury.
For Cabinet Office responsibilities inrelation to the Ministers Resident overseasin the Second World War, see p.The Cabinet Office provided accommodationfor the Minister for the Co-ordination ofD.fence.     They have also at different times,provided accommodation for the Lord President,the Lord Privy Seal, and the Paymaster-Gener -1.In 1947 the Cabinet Office provided accommodationfor the Minister ^&quot;Economic Affairs(Sir Stafford Crfpps).In I947f on the appointment of Lord Inmanas Lord Privy Seal, the Secretary of the Cabinetcalled upon him to give him copies of the noteson procedure together with copies of Cabinetpapers awaiting consideration by the Cabinet.It was subsequently arranged that the CabinetOf fi -3 Secretaries of the Committees of whichhe was made a member should see him to explainthe functions of these Committees and theircurrent business.     See File 7/2/3 Part 5.For the adjustments made in CabinetCommittee membership on the appointment ofMr. Hugh Dalton as Chancellor of the Duchy ofLancaster in 1948 see File 7/2/3 Part 6.
1During the war a number of Ministers were appointed tocertain specially created posts overseas.The Cabinet Offlee was responsible for keeping theseMinisters informed generally and. In particular, aboutCabinet business.     The Secretary of the War Cabinet providedtheir official link with the Afar Cabinet and with HomeDepartments and accommodation in the Cabinet Office wasprovided for them during their visits to the United Kingdom.The Secretary of the Cabinet was also responsible forkeeping the King informed of the movements of residentMinisters abroad.

He also communicateddirect with the Pris Minister and Ministerof Defence by personal telegram when convenient.In March, 1942, Mr. H.G. Casey succeededMr. Dyttelton as Minister of State, Middle Sast,(W. P.(42)143).    On the appointment of anotherMinister of State (Mr. Richard Daw) Mr. Casey&apos;atitle was changed to that of Minister of StateResident in the Middle Sast.In January, 1944, Dord Moyne succeededMr. Casey and was described as Minister Residentin the Middle Sast;   his office carriedCabinet rank, but he was not a member of theWar Cabinet.     In March, 1944* his d ties weremodified and a revised directive (.V.P.

The Prime Minister in tendering his resignation infact tenders the resignation of the whole Administrationto the King, i.e. there is no need for individualMlnlsterc to submit their recommendations to the Ling.     Theiroffiees are regarded as bein0 at the disposal of the newrrime Minister;   this is to even if the &quot;new&quot; Prime Ministeris the &quot;old&quot; Prime Minister.     Pending the formation of a newAdministration Ministers carry on the work of their offices.When the Prime minister has submitted his resignation hewrites to his colleagues to that effect.In a reconstructed Administration Ministers who retainthe same offices are not reappointed or re-sworn.Use Jennings, pp. 67-68;   No. 10, Downingatreut Handbook, pp. 15-16.Vhen Mr. Baldwin resigned in May. 1937 andthe Chancellor of the ixehequer, Mr. Chamberlainsucceeded him as Prime minister, the Cabinetagreed that:-&quot;(a) The Chancellor of the Exchequer shouldof the Cabinet present placed theirresignations at his disposal whenhe was sent for by the King, andthat there was no necessity for any. inister to confirm this in writing.(b) That Ministers at the head ofGovernment Departments should explainthe position to their respectivet arliamentary Undersecretaries andascertain that they were willing tocomply with the arrangement recordedin Conclusion (a) above.(c) -&apos;hat the secretary to the Cabinetshould be instructed to send a copyof this conclusion without delaj topresent, as well as to Ministers(other than Parliamentary Under-decretariee)&quot; who were not members ofthe Cabinet, and ascertain that theyare willing to confirm to Conclusion(a)&quot;.     (C.M.22(37UU).When Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s Government fell onthe 10th May, 1940, the .Var Cabinet agreed thatthe New i-rlme Minister &quot;should be authorisedto assume that all member a of t be War Cabinetplaced their resignations at the disposal of thenew Prime Minister when sent for by the King,and that there was no necessity for this to beconfirmed in writing&quot;, and th; t &quot;in the aieantime,diaisters would remain in office and continue todischarge their functions until a newAdministration had been fonaed%   (*.M.119(4o;5)*be authorised to asmembere of the Cabinet

If bisexplanation involves a reference to Cabinet discussions, thepractice is for hlra first to obtain through the Prims Ministerthe King&apos;s consent to such disclosure.See generally, Jennings, p. 208;   Anson\   llil) p. 110-111;   Ho 10 Downing Street,1   Handbook, p.It was held in December, 1940, at the timewhen Mr. ::ore-3elisha resigned from the officeof Secretary of State for Var, that the need toobtain the King&apos;n consent to the disclosure ofCabinet proceedings applied also to the^isolusure of documents of State as well asCabinet documents.     See Pile 4/3/90.For examples of personal statements in theHouse of Commons on resignation, ass Hansard.House of Commons, 21st February, 1938, Col. 45(Mr.  den)x Hansard, House of Commons, 3rdOctober, 1938, Col. 29 (Mr. Duff Cooper).It was held in 1921 that it was &quot;inaccordance with the unvarying traditions of thisHouse that a Minister who has resigned hisoffice should make a full statement to the Houseof his reasons&quot;.   (Hansard, House of Commons,14th July, 1921, Col. 1490).In May, 1946, on the occasion of theresignation of Sir Ben Smith from the officeof Minister of Food the Opposition pressedstrongly that the House was entitled to a personalstatement.    In reply the Dord President quotedmany cases of resignations without statementsquite apart from those in the war.   (Hansard,House of Com ions, 31st May, 1946, Cols. 1509* 10).e
mmm qf %wmm/Y . Iff through illnee.8 or official business outside theUnited Kingdom, a Minister is lively to be absent for asubstantial period, the Prime Minister may make arrangementsfor some other Minister to take charge temporarily of theDepartment concerned.    It is customary for the Prims Ministerhimself to assume charge of the Foreign Office if the ForeignSecretary is absent for any lengthy period.    The matteris not one in which the Cabinet Office are required to take anyinitiative.     The arrangement made is ua&quot;ua!ly reported to theCabinet and recorded in the Cabinet minutes.     If the CabinetOffice receive notification from a Minister*s Private Secretarythat his Minister is ill, steps should be taken to confirm thatthe Prime Minister has been informed.    Action by the CabinetOffice is normally confined to considering what, if any,special arrangements are required as regards attendance atCabinet and Cabinet Cou.ittee meetings and to making a submission!accordingly to the Prime Minister.On the submission of memoranda to theCabinet in the absence of the Ministerresponsible see Part I, AnnexIn 1947* when it was clear that theLord President (Mr. Morrison) was lively to beabsent, through illness, for a considerable/ y period^the Jeer tary of the Cabinet made asubmission to the Prime Minister on the conductof the Committees of which he was chairman.The chair of the Lord Presidents Committee, forexample, was taken by the Chancellor of tbeExchequer, and responsibility for the generalconduct of the Government information services(of which the Lord President had charge) wasassigned temporarily to the President of theBoard of Trade.     See File 7/2/3 andCP. (47)87.In the absence through illness of theMinister of Transport (Mr. A* Barnes) for aperiod of months in 1947, the Prime Ministerarranged for the Secretary of State forCommonwealth Relations (Mr. Noel-Baker, who hadbeen Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry ofTransport in the Coalition Government) to takecharge of the Department temporarily.    Duringthat period the Secretary of State for Com ion-wealth Relations normally handled at Cabinet anymatters of concern to the Ministry of Transport;the Parliamentary Secretary usually represented the\ministry*s view-point at meetings of CabinetCo... .ittees (CM.83(47)1).The Lord Privy Seal (Lord Addison, a formersecretary of state for the Dominions) has onoccasion been given general charge of the&quot; c , Commonwealth Relations Office in the Absenceof the Secretary of State overseas.On the general question of the extent towhich one Minister may act for another see minutes!of July, 1949 on File 4/1/44.
The current notes on procedure stateXt is the established practice for a Member of the Cabinetor a Miniet r in charge of a Department to obtain the Ling&apos;apermission to be absent from the United Kingdom, whetheron duty or on leave, and to inform His Majesty of thearrangements which he proposes to make for the administrationof hie office during that time.Any such arrangements must have the Prime Minister * a priorapproval and are subject to certain general limitations.In the absence of a Secretary of State, submissions toHis Majesty must be made on his behalf by another Secretaryof State.     Submissions on behalf of the First Lord of theAdmiralty may be made in his absence by the Senior LordCom list loner.    In the absence of other Cabinet Ministers,submission may be made by the Parliamentary Secretary of theDepartment concerned, if he is a Privy Councillor;   If not,by another Cabinet Minister.Parliamentary Secretaries who wish to be absent from theUnited kingdom s ould obtain the consent of the Prime Ministeras   ell as of their own Minister.(CP. (49)95, paragraph 54).See generally File 4/1/44.Earlier statements of the rule set out inparagraph 54 of CP. (49)95 used the expression&quot;Minister of Cabinet Rank&quot; instead of ^Memberof the Cabinet or a Minister in charge of aDepartment.&quot;    It was made clear in January.1948, that a Minister who was not in chargeof a Department and not a Member of the Cabinet -(e.g. the Minister of State at the ForeignOffice) need not obtain the King&apos;8 permission.For this purpose the United kingdom includesthe Channel Islands and the Isle of Man (as wellas Northern Ireland.)The first statement of this rule was circulatedby the Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill) on19th October, 1943 after correspondence betweenthe Secretary of the Cabinet and the Klng*sPrivate Secretary and a formal submissionto the King by the Prime Minister.    On the historyof the practice see letter of 14th September, 1943from Sir Alan Dascelles, and, for earlier noteson the procedure, letters of 6th and 13th &quot;njtniaaii1939, on File 4/1/44.When the King visited   South Africa in1947 he asked that Ministers who Intended goingoutside the United Kingdom should obtain theconsent of the Council of State (through theDuke of Gloucester as leading counsellor).Letter   of 31st January, 1947, File 10/8/25/2.In July, 1946, the Chancellor of the Duchyof Lancaster (who was at the time Minister incharge of the Control Office for Germanyand Austria) left the United Kingdom for Germany
(ut having obtained the K.ing*b permission.In the correspondence which followed Sir AlanLaseelles expressed the view that although mwas fulfilling non-Duchy duties, the Office ofthe Chancellor of the Dudy should be respoos ibisfor approaching the Palace with a view toobtaining the King^ consent to absence.See Pile k/l/hk.
\b If the Cabinet Office is notified by a Department of thedeath of a Minister steps should he taken (unless in thecircumstances it is clearly unnecessary to do so) to confirmthat the Department have informed the Palace and the PrimeMinister.    The Press Notice is normally issued by theDepartment, who are responsible for informing the Speaker.The Prims Minister informs the Cabinet;   it is customary fora record to be made in the Cabinet Minutes..Tbe- Memorial Service is arranged by the Department, inconsultation with the relatives, but the Cabinet Office maybe asked for advice.     oee   fu^a.t&quot;ju lil^.Action by the Cabinet Office is normally confined(7.   (1) to considering, in relation to the appointment of thesucceeding Minister, what adjustments in Cabinet Committee!membership are called for and thereafter making a submissionto the Prime Minister; and(ii) to taking in duo course any steps necessary to recoverCabinet documents in the Minister&apos;e personal possession andto confirming that documents issued to him are eitherreturned to the Cabinet Office or, where required for purposesof current administration, taken over by his successor,oee Part V.In January, 1947 the Minister of Education(Miss  Lien Wilkinson) died in office.     TheCabinet met later that day, suspended itsproceedings for a few minutes as a tribute tobar memory.     (CM. 17(47)).
Oo the death of a former Minister the action which theCabinet office may be required to take consists of (a)assisting, as may be necessary, la the arrangements for amemorial service?   and (b) considering, is due coarse, whatsteps may be needed to recover from executors any Cabinetdocuments which may come into their possession.OB their arrangements for MemorialServices see Part VII.On recovery of Cabinet document a fromformer Ministers aee Fart IV.Zt la a long standing practice of bothHouses of Parliament that at the next sittingfollowing the death of certain prominentpersons tributes ahould be paid to theirmemories and that the Houses should thereafterbe adjourned, without any further businessbeing taken, until the following daw.On the death of Sari Baldwin the Cabinetconsidered- on 15th December, 1947(c.u.95(47;l) whether this practice ahouldbe observed on this occasion la view of thepreasure on Parliament&apos; a time.   The view ofthe Cabinet was that while there waa much tobe said against any automatic practice ofadjournment on the death of a former PrimeMinister, this aaa not a matter on which anyParty controversy ahould be allowed to develop.The Cabinet accordingly invited the Chiefwhip to take soundings of the Opposition andin the event both Houses were adjourned forone day aa a mars of respect - the House ofCommons on 15th December and the House ofLords on 17th Deo ember, 1947*The matter came up again on 5th February,1948 (CUll (48)1) when the question waaraised whether toe bualneaa of the House ofLorda should be Interrupted in order to paytribute to the memory of the Sari of Derby.The Prime Minister aald that the practice inthe House of Coanoaa waa to pay such tributesonly on the death ef Soyal personages, heads ofStates, former Prime Ministers or Party Leadersand Ministers dying while in office.   He hadrecently realated a auggeation that the Houseof Commons ahould pay aueh a tribute to thememory of Mr. Oandhl.

At their meeting on 24th July (CM. (50) 49thConclusions, Minute 1) the Cabinet agreed that it wouldeither House of Parliament to the death of Mr. MeekansieKing, a former Vriae Minister of Canada.     They consideredthat such occasions should be restricted as narrowly aspossible and that it would be undesirable to establish anew precedent far paying such a  tribute   to the memory ofa statesman of  another Commonwealth country.A note an the practice in this matter over the periodfrom 1778 (death of Lord Chatham) to 1933 (death ofLard Salisbury) is given in Miscellaneous Records lie 68,not be proper farformal reference to be aada in
During the war of 1939-45 the Cabinet Officein agreement with Scotland Yard, arrangedthe issue of priority labels for the cars ofMinisters.     Special facilities were given tocars bearing these labels to enable them totravel under war conditions without unnecessarydelay.     The labels were issued to Ministers,visiting Commonwealth Ministers, Allied visitorsof importance, the Chiefs of Staff and certainsenior commanders.     By the Road Vehicles(Functional and Other Maries) Order (S.R. and 0.No. 53 of 6th June, 1943) the unauthorised useof these labels was made an offence.     Thelabels were withdrawn in August, 1945.    SeeFile 4/5/22/1.On 18th January, 1950, the Prime Minister(Mr. Attics) issued instructions (CP. (50) 11)that official oars should not be used, even onrepayment, for Journeys connected with taw forthcoming lection, nor should they be used at all in aMinister *s constituency.

These cars are intended essentiallyfor use on official business, but they may also be used onprivate journeys on payment of a mileage charge laiddown by the Treasury.
Mr TiniPtrt0    QJD The arrangements for providing air transport for Ministersare set out In CP. (47)218 (paragraph 9). as modified byMinistry of Civil Aviation circular letter to Departmentsof 11th April, 1949.   The Cabinet Office has no responsibilityfor the provision of air transport for Ministers o.g. to enablethem to attend special Cabinet meetings:   the arrangementsmust be made by the Departments concerned.See generally Pile 4/1/34.An earlier statement (May 1946) was givenin C.?. (46)195.In July, 1939, arrangements were made bythe Air Ministry to convey Cabinet Ministers toDondon by air in the event of a Cabinet meetingsummoned at short notice when they were aconsiderable distance from Dondon.    (CM.39(39)1).The Cabinet Office notified all Ministers ofthese agreements.Before the General  lection in 1945 theSecretary of State for Air raised (CM.7(45)7)the question whether, during the GeneralElection, Ministers should be allowed to useService aircraft when travelling to andfrom their constituencies and when visitingother constituencies.     The Cabinet agreed thatin view of their heavy public duties Ministersought to have the right to use service aircraftand invited the Daw Officers to consider thematter.    The Attorney-General gave his opinionthat free travel facilities by Service aircraftto the Ministers for Journeys connected withthe Election would be admissible under theelectoral law (CP. (45)37).     In a minute of19th June, 1945 the Prime Minister ruled thatMinisters or ex-Ministers using service aircraftfor Election purposes should pay the price ofa first-class railway ticket and that theproceeds should be given to a Royal Air ForceCharity.     He added that &quot;a Minister or ex-minister must on no account be driven to apolitical meeting but may be taken by a Servicevehicle to the nearest hotel where he mustarrange his further transport.    For thejourney in the Air Force vehicle he mustpay ordinary official mileage rate&quot;.On 6th and 13th November, 1947 the Cabinetdiscussed the line to be taken in athreatened adjournment debate in the House ofCommons about the flight to the Far East of theMinister of Civil Aviation.   (CM.85(47)3 and87(47)1). &apos;On 20th October, 1947 the Government wasquestioned in the House of Lords about the useof air transport for the conveyance of Ministersto London for special Cabinet Meetings. (Hansard,House of Lords, Col. 1482).   See also Hansard,House of Commons. Vol. 443, Col. 87, 176-7(written answers).
In reply to a Question on 25th  November, HUithe Chancellor of the Exchequer sala thatMinisters of Cabinet rank could use theirdiscretion in chartering aircraft, and thatprior Treasury permission was not required.Ee added that Service aircraft might be usedby Ministers at the discretion of the AirMinistry.   (Hansard, house of Commons, Col. 273*)On 18th January, 1950, the Prise Minister(Mr. Attlee) Issued instructions (CP. (50) 11):(i)   that Service aircraft should not be usedfor journeys on  lection business;(ii)   that civil aircraft should not be paidfor from public funds if used for journeysan  lection or ether Party politicalbusiness;  bat exceptionally a Ministerrecalled unexpectedly for urgent officialbasiaeos sight claim repayment of thecost of a journey by air if no otherscans of transport were available.
0 i 10*In reply to a Question on 4th November, 1947 theChancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Dal ton) gave the followingdetail si-*?ive Ministers are provided with rent-free residentialaccommodation - namely, the Prime Minister, the Chancelbrof the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, the Lord Chancellor (as Speaker of the House ofLords) and the First Lord of the Admiralty.    In the ease ofthe Foreign Secretary, the practice was introduced in 1946,though his predecessor had occupied a rent-free flat inthe Foreign Office.   In the other eases the arrangement isof long standing, dating hack to the eighteenth, or to theearly nineteenth century.   In all five eases the accomraoda-tlon at present consists of a flat or suite of rooms ina building, the rest of which is used for official andother State purposes, and the cost to the taxpayer can,therefore, be only approximately assessed by way ofapportionments.   On this basis, the annual cost to thetaxpayer is at present about  1,100 in respect ofcontribution in lieu of rates on these five realdoneesand about  5,000 in respect of maintenance, heating andlighting and garage accommodation.   The building whichcontains the Foreign Secretary1s flat is held on lease fromthe Commissioners of Crown Lands (the proportion of therent attributable to the residential portion being about l,0O0)i   in the other oases the accommodation is inCrown buildings and no rent is payable from public funds.&quot;The above figures do not include Chequers, whichis the property of Trustees.   The bulk of the annualexpenditure is net from the income of the Trust, asconstitutes under the Chequers Estate Act, 1917t   but forthe last 20 years certain charges in respect of maintenanceand repairs have been borne on the Votes of the Ministryof Works.   These at present amount, excluding non-recurrent expenditure, to about  1,850 per annum.&quot;Ho other Ministers receive any other emoluments inaddition to their salaries.   The provision of officialcars to enable Ministers to discharge their duties is anessential part of normal administrative expenditure andIt is not an emolument of Ministers.   Since this arrange-asat was introduced in 1939, official oars and drivers havebeen available to senior Ministers.   The annual eost isabout  1,000 a head.   Mo oars ars allocated to juniorMinisters, who, however, are entitled to draw on a oar poolfor official purposes.   The eost of such facilities is aboutIs.44. a mile.&quot;   (Hansard, House of Commons, Cols. 1529-31)
Special arrangements are made by the Hone Officeand Scotland Yard for the protection of certain seniorM1?1^*rS* Including the Prime Minister, the Lord Presidentand the Foreign Secretary.   The Cabinet office have noresponsibility for these arrangementa.This natter has in the past boondiscussed by the Cabinet oft one or twooccasions, o.g. Cob. 36(22), App.III, 2.nrmnansatlnn for Injury or Death on DutwDuring the Second World War, in view of the specialrinks of air travel under war conditions, civil Servantswore allowed to charge to public funds the coot of premiumsto cover insurance up to the aura equal to two years1 salary.This practice, which extended also to Ministers, wascontinued after the war, but it was not invariably followedand applied only to air travel.   On 25th October, 1948 theCabinet agreed that no provision should bo made frompublic funds for the dependants of Mini stars killed orInjured in the course of their duties;   and that the practiceof meeting from public funds the coat of premiums on specialinsurance policies to cover Ministers against the risk ofair travel should bo discontinued.

) PARLIAMENTARY SgCR^TARpS?%%4 The current statement of the functions of Parliamentaryoecretarias and of their position in relation to SeniorMinisters and Heads of Departments is given in CP. (49)31*The statement in the current notes on procedure on thehandling of Cabinet Conclusions in Departments includes thefollowing passageIn this connection the position of the ParliamentarySecretary should not be overlooked.     He may have to deputisefor his Minister, at Cabinet or in the house, at short notice.Apart from any special responsibility assigned to him in alimited field, he should be fully informed of the work of theDepartment and kept in general touch with all Cabinet mattersaffecting it, so that when called upon to attend a meetingin place of the Minister he understands the, subject and doesnot merely recite a brief.(CP. (49)95, paragraph 24).See generally, Jennings, pp. 56-57:Anson, vol. 11(1), pp. 223-4;   Brskine May,p. 202;   Pile 4/1/58.The statement in CP. (49)31 was issued in tbelight of the Report of the Tribunal of Inquiryinto certain allegations against Ministersand officials.    (Cmd. 7616).    (Pile 15/34/57).The actual appointments are technicallyvested In Secretaries of State and otherMinisters, but the King*s pleasure is alwaystaken by the Prime Minister.     The Prime Ministerin substance makes tbe appointment, but consultstbe Minister under whom the Junior Minister willwork.On the precise position of the JuniorMinisters in the Service Departments see corres-pondsnce (April, 1949) in Pile 4/1/58.When Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd was ParliamentaryUnder-Secretary of state for the HomeDepartment in 1938/39 he assumed a specialresponsibility for A.R.P. questions.Although tbe Secretary of State did not divesthimself of his statutory responsibility forthese matters he transferred the day to daysupervision of the A.R.P., Department toMr. Lloyd.     To facilitate this arrangement, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,o while continuing to carry out tbe duriesof his ora office, was specially attached to theHome Office and assisted the Home Secretary inthe Department and in the House.   (Hansard,House of Commons, 23rd June, 1938, Col. 271).
When too ministry of Fuel aud Power wasset up in 1942 (S.K. and 0 1131 and 1132)Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd (who had been Secretaryfor Petroleum,   Board of Trade, from 1940)became one of the Parliamentary Under-Secretaries but as Chairman of the Oil ControlBoard he retained his right to report direct tothe Prime Minister, and remained responsibleto the Minister of Defence for questions ofpetroleum war-fare.In 1943147 the Joint Parliamentary Under-uecretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Buchanan)was given day-to-day responsibility, under theSecretary of otate, in the field of housing.See File 15/14/3.For the definition of the duties of theFinancial Secretary to the Treasury and theEconomic Secretary to the Treasury see File4/1/53.On the attendance of Junior ministers atCabinet meetings see Part I.In 1938 it was suggested that theParliamentary Secretaries should be given copiesof certain Foreign Office telegrams.   ThePrime Minister (Mr. Chamberlain) took the view,however, that Junior Ministers would hardly bein a position to understand and defendGovernment policy on the strength of the lesssecret telegrams only and that it was impossibleto let them have the more secret telegrams anddespatches.(Letter of 11th May, 1938).

Tha onrrant notea on procedure statot-Parliamentary Private Secretaries occupy a special positionwhich is not always understood by tbs general public, eitherat home or abroad.    They are not members of the Government, andshould be careful not to be spoken of as such.    They are PrivateMembers, and should therefore be afforded as great a libertyof action as possible;   but their olose and confidential associationwith Ministers necessarily imposes certain obligations on them,and has led to the generally accepted practice set out in thefollowing paragraph.Parliamentary Private Secretaries should not make statementsin the House or put Questions on matters affecting the Departmentwith which they are connected.     They should also exercisegreat discretion in any speeches or broadcasts which they make out-side the House, taking care not to make statements which appearto be made in an official or semi-official oapaelty, and bearingin mind at the same time that, however careful they may be tomake it clear that they are speaking only as Private Members, theyare nevertheless liable to be regarded as speaking with some ofthe authority which attaches to a member of the Government,Generally they must act with a sense of responsibility and withdiscretion;   and they must not associate themselves withparticular groups advocating special policies.(CP. (49)95, paragraphs 52-53).A Parliamentary Private Secretary is not a member of theGovernmentf   and the information given to him should becorrespondingly limited.(0.P.(49)95, paragraph 36 (4)).See File 4/3/107.   For earlier statementsof tbs practice see CP. (46)199;   Ci. (47)280.In 1946, the Prime Minister decided thatParliamentary Private Secretaries should notwrits articles or make public pronouncementson mattars which are the immediate concern ofthe Minister whom they serve.   (Letter of12th September, 1946 from the Prime Minister^Privats secretary to the Air Ministryi   SeeFile 4/1/6A).In 1937, the Prime Minister mentioned inOablnet that he had learnt that a very secretdocument of the O.I.D. which had not yet beencirculated to the Cabinet had been seen anddiscussed by certain Parliamentary PrivateSecretaries.     He said that there was somethingto be said for Parliamentary * rivate secretariesseeing certain official papers but that thisshould not apply to the most secret documents,Including documents of the Cabinet and theCI.D. (Cab, 43(37)2 and CP.285(37)) (Files48/1/1 and 4/3/107).
Ia the debate on the Address in November1946 a number of Parliamentary PrivateSecretaries were among the Government supporterswho tabled an amendment relating to foreignpolicy.     On 18th November the Cabinet(CM.97(46) - no record) discussed whether theyshould be required at once to resign theirappointments.    The general feeling was againstthis, but that they should be given a warningand the Ministers concerned were asked to warntheir Parliamentary Secretaries accordingly.On 22nd November the Prims Minister sent aprivate minute to all Senior Ministers askingthem to see their Parliamentary PrivateSecretaries and to explain the nature oftheir obligations.      See Pile ^/Aj/ojIn May, 1949 five Parliamentary PrivateSecretaries voted against the Government on theIreland Bill and were subsequently asked,at the instigation of the Prime Minister toresign their positions, (one of the five bad,in anticipation, given his resignation).In June 1947 it was contemplated that theParliamentary Private Secretary to the Chanaallorof the Duchy of Lancaster (Lord Pakenham) andto the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of Stateat cho Foreign Office would be given rathermore responsibility than the averageParliamentary Private Secretary and **ould beparticularly concerned under Lord fakenham,with German affairs.    This intention was,however, dropped.     See Flle /j/*/s^Hi Marsh, 1930, the Prims Minister*s ParliaawataryPrivate Secretary (Mr. Moyls) was invited to broadcastin the series called &quot;The Week in Westminster&quot;, i.e. togive a brief auwaary at the wad of the week of eventsin Barlisnent daring that week,   the Secretary ef theCabinet, who van asked for advice an this by the PriseMinister &apos;s principal Private Secretary, consideredthat it would be impossible to give a broadcast ef thissort without expressing scam views on the merits of thevarious interventions in the debates and there was adanger that such views, coming from the Prise Minister^Parliamentary Private Secretary, might be regarded ashaving the Prime Minister *s authority.   He thereforeadvised against acceptance of the invitation.
For the circulation of Cabinet memorandaand conclusions to Ministers not in the Cabinetsee Part v.For the arrangement of meetings of Ministersand a list of such meetings see File 48/28.In 1939, the .Var Cabinet agreed (W.M.2(39)8)that the Prime Minister should make sucharrangements as he thought fit to keep Ministersinformed generally, and it was suggested thata weekly appreciation of the situation shouldbe prepared by the Chiefs of Staff, and thatoccasional meetings of all Ministers should beheld.In December, 1939, the Prime Minister helda meeting of all Ministers of Cabinet rank andexplained that he proposed to hold meetings withall Ministers outside the war Cabinet to keepthem in touch with the war situation and thatthe meetings should be held either under bisChairmanship or that of the Foreign Secretaryor the minister for Co-ordination of Defence.Meetings were held either weekly or foxtnightlyon t Is basis from then until the middle ofMay, 1940.     a minute was kept but was notcirculated by the Secretary to the Cabinet.The meetings were attended by all Ministers ofCabinet ran*s. -bwfr who were not members of theWar Cabinet.     The business was usuallya general review of the situation.From July, 194-0 the meetings were heldmore infrequently, usually on a particularaspect of the war situation and were presidedover either by the Prime Minister or by theMinister particularly concerned in the subject.From January, 1942 the Prime Minister usuallypresided over the meetings himself, and nominute was taken.A general mooting of Ministers was heldshortly after Mr. Attlee*s administration tookoffice in 1945 and one or two further meetings ofthis character took place in 1946.   On 7th July,1947 the Prime Minister held a meeting of allMinisters not in the Cabinet for generaldiscussion about the economic situation.   Asimilar meeting was held on 26th November, 1947So From time to time meetings of Ministers are held at0 which the Prime Minister or other Senior Minister explainsthe background to developments of policy to Ministers not inthe Cabinet and to Junior Ministers.     The scope of thesemeetings and the attendance at them vary with the occasion.They are normally held in the House of Commons and they areusually summoned by letter from the Cabinet Office at thePrime Minister*s direction.    These meetings are to bedistinguished from purely political meetings.     No recordis normally made, and members of the Cabinet Secretariat donot attend.    The Prime Ministers Private Secretaries makea rough list of the attendance.
when the Prime Minister explained theconsiderations which had led a majority of toeCabinet to toe new that toe time was notopportune for abolishing toe death penalty.A further meeting on this subject was heldon 13th April. 1948.   Ob 28th October. 1948.toe Lord President and the Minister ofSupply spoke at a meeting of Ministers not inthe Cabinet sod junior Ministers about toe easefor the Iron and steel Bill.   Shis meeting(unlike earlier meetings of the kind, whiehhare mostly bees held in the House of Commoos)took place In the Cabinet Office.Other means of keeping Ministers generally Informed aretoe circulation of periodic reports and notes for speeches.Thus an Ministers. Including Junior Ministers are givencopies of the Sconomle Bulletin (prepared by the leoaaleInformation Unit) sad the speakers1 notes prepared atintervals by the Foreign Office on toe alma and methods ofSoviet Foreign Policy.For the Economic Bulletin see File 30/22/38.For the speakers&apos; rotes see File 14/3/41.-*j?9*&quot;
321-      Toe current notes on procedure stateGeneralWhen addressing meetings Ministers oust keep within theambit of Government policy and not anticipate decisions notyet made public.    They must be careful in dealing with matterswithin the responsibility of other Ministers not to embarrassthem by statements at variance with Ministerial pronouncements.In all cases of doubt they should consult the Ministerconcerned.The Foreign Office should Invariably be consulted beforeany mention is made of matters affecting our relations withforeign Powers or foreign affairs;   and Ministers winningto make reference to broad matters of Defence policy should inall cases first consult the Minister of Defence.    Ministersshould also be specially careful in referring to mattersaffecting our relations wit. self-governing Commonwealthcountries, or to the political aspects of Colonial affairs,e.g* self-government in certain Colonies, and should consultthe Commonwealth Relations Office or Colonial Officerespectively except where the matter falls within theirown responsibility.In the present international situation care is needed asto what is said by Ministers in conversations at social functionsat Embassies.     If matters of foreign policy are discussed atsuch functions, a note should be made afterwards of thesalient points of the conversation and a copy tent to the ForeignSecretary.Effect on Parliamentary Business.Unless they have first obtained the agreement of theLeader of the House of Commons, Ministers should avoid sayinganything which might affect the programme of Governmentbusiness in Parliament.    Thus, they should not, without hieagreement, promise White Papers, the publication of which mightresult in a demand for a special debate:   and legislationshould never be promised without the express approval of theCabinet or the Legislation Committee.     This is a matter inwhich special care is necessary, since statements mode byMinisters are liable to be represented in the Press asforeshadowing early legislation.(CP. (49)95* paragraphs 39-42).See generally File 42/21/1.In the exmmi- of 1936, the Prime Minister(Mr. Baldwin) ruled that in view of the inter-national situation at the time, &quot;Cabinet Ministersshould exercise great care whom making anyreference to foreign affairs in their speechesand should submit any proposed statement onforeign affairs to the Foreign Secretary for bisapproval&quot;.    (C.M.42(36)12).     (This wasinterpreted as applying only to speeches in whichit was intended to make special or detailedreference to foreign affairs.)    This warning wasjo
again given by the Prime Minister(ilr. Chamberlain) early In 1939.    (Cab. 2(39)4).In March, 1939, (Cab. 15(39)4) the ForeignSecretary asked Ministers to make themselvesresponsible for approving speeches to be madeby their Parliamentary Secretaries whilecontinuing to submit to him their ownspeeches on Foreign Affairs.In July, 1939 the Prime Minister saidthat &quot;in view of the international situationat the time he thought that it would bedesirable that ministers should, as far aspossible refrain from making speeches oninternational affairs in genera^ &quot;   (CM.37(39)8).On 6th May, 1941 the Prime Minister(Mr. Churchill) circulated a note emphasisingthe need to clear with the Foreign Office andGeneral Iemay (Chief of Staff to the Ministerof Defence) the terms of any references inspeeches to foreign affaire or military matters.This Instruction was recirculated, withadjustments, several times.In July, 1941 the Prime Minister circulateda memorandum on information and propaganda(W.P.(41)149) stating that Ministers who weremembers of the War Cabinet and those whoregularly sat with them, viz.   service Ministers,the Home Secretary, tbe Secretary of State forthe Dominions, tbe Colonial Secretary (asleader of the House of Lords), and the Ministerof Information were free to make speeches ex-pounding the policy of the Var Cabinet, butplacing restrictions on speeches by otherMinisters.For references to premature statements onprospective legislation etc., see File S.5OA0/15.In June, 1948 tbe Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee)sent a note to Ministers asking them to refrain ironpublic comment about the proceedings cf theUnited States Congress on the appropriations forthe European Recovery Programme.In March, 1949 the Foreign Secretary askedall Senior Ministers (including the AttorneyGeneral) through the Cabinet Office to refrainfrom comment in speeches on soviet Ministerialchanges, including M. Molotov*a departure fromthe Soviet Foreign Ministry:   he promisedthat the Foreign Office would circulate a notefor guidance.In reply to a Parliamentary Question on1st November, 1948 on statements on foreignaffairs the Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee) said:&quot;The principle of collective responsibilityrequires that any Minister making a publicstatement on matters outside his own departmentalresponsibilities shall consider whether the viewswhich be proposes to express are in accordwith Government policy and, if need be, put thematter beyond doubt by consultation with ois
colleagues,     This applies to statmants onforeign affairs as on other aspects ofGovernment policy.     Civil Servants andsenior officers in the forces in thiscountry are not normally encouraged toiiiake public statements on matters of policy, *Hansard, Ilouse of Commons, Col. 514.In 1937 a Question was asked in the Bouseof Commons shout the practice of Ministersin addressing unofficial committees ormeetings of Members while the House was sitting.The Prime Minister (Mr. Chamberlain) repliedthat the object of these meetings was to enableMembers to keep themselves informed on variousaspects of public affairs and that he sawno reason to interfere.

Speechei^at Parliamentary By-31ectionw and Local (^vernaftniThe current notes on procedure stateMembers of the Cabinet should not normally speak atBy-21ectlona;   but other Ministers, including those ofCabinet rank, may do so.    As a general rule Ministers abovethe rank of Parliamentary Secretary should not speak at localgovernment elections.    There may, however, be occasions onwhich a Minister may feel obliged to do so for specialreasons, particularly in bis own constituency.(CP. (49) 95, paragraph 43).See Pile 4/1/26.The present practice as regards By-Slectionswas laid down by the Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee)in July, 1946 on a particular ease arisingat the time of the Battersea By-aiection.The word &quot;normally&quot; was included, with thePrime Minister*s approval, in the restatementin CP. (49)95 in view of departures from thestrict rule at subsequent By-Sleetions(e.g. Crave send, October, 1947).In 1934, it was agreed by the PrimeMinister (Mr. Macdonald) and the leader of theOpposition (Mr. Baldwin) that members of theCabinet and the former Conservative Cabinetshould not speak at By-Slections.    (CM. 19(34)8).In 1938, in view of the Opposition practiceof speaking at By-Slections tbe Cabinet agreedthat its members should be released from theconvention hitherto observed. (CM. 15(38) 16).On 26th September, 1939 the Party whipsreached agreement on a party truce inParliamentary By-Elections for the duration ofthe war.    They undertook, on behalf of theirrespective parties, not to nominate candidatesagainst those nominated by the party holdingthe seat at the time when the vacancy occured.In 1941, the Cabinet agreed that it was inthe national Interest that the Government caseshould be strongly represented at By-Electionsand that, therefore, Government speakers shouldgo down to the constituencies in which by-elections were being held;   but that this stepshould be without prejudice to the acceptedrule that Cabinet Ministers and Ministers ofCabinet rank should not speak at By-Elections.(W.M. 98(41)1 and w.M.loo(4I)7).Participation of Ministers In local govern-ment elections is governed by a Cabinet decisionof 11th October, 1945.

Tbe rule has frequently been stated inParliamentary answers e.g. Hansard, Bouse ofCommons, 3rd March, 1927* Col. 539 (statementby Mr. Baldwin);   5th May, 1932, Col. 1231:9th February, 1933, Cols. 352-3 (contributionsto party publications not banned);   26th Bonsmber,193&amp;t Cols. 499-500; 3rd December, 1934, Cols.1233-4 (article by the Postmaster-General);2nd December, 1937, Cols. 2238-9 (Press articleby a Minister);   27th January, 1947, Cols. 935-6(Press interview by the Minister of Education],The current ruling on Press articles andcontributions to party publications was givenin November, 1945*On the question   whether a Minister may addhis signature to a letter to the Press from anunofficial body see note of 30th October, 1946on File 4/1/23.Before the 1945 General  lection, thePrims Minister (Mr. Churchill) laid down that&quot;During the period covered by tbe GeneralElection when greater freedom can properlyprevail, all Ministers may write articlesin any newspaper in prosecution of theGovernment*s alms or in defence of its policy.No payment may, however, be received for sucharticles and Minister should be careful thatthey do not show favouritism to particularnewspapers&quot;.   He stated that when the electionwas over the normal rule would be observed(CP. (45)27).In reply to a minute from the Lord PrivySeal (Lord Beaverbrook) saying that, for theperiod of the General Election, he proposedto participate in the direction of leadingarticles and the determination of policy inconnection with his newspapers, Mr. Churchillsaid that he saw no harm in anonymous articlesfrom any quarter, but that it would be unwisefor him to write over his own name in his ownpapers as this would make people think that hiscontact with them was direct.     He could giveadvice to his own papers to any extentnecessary;   and he could write in his ownname for other papers.    (Prime Minister*sMinute 663/45).Before the 1950 General Election, the Brine Minister(Mr. Attlee) issued instructions (CP. (50) 8) aiadlsrto those issued by Mr. Churchill in 1945 about tberelaxation during the election period ef the rulesgoverning press articles and interviews by Ministers.
0 The current notes on procedure state:-The granting of a special interviews to individual Pressrepresentatives is a matter for the discretion of theMinister concerned.   As a general rule, however, the anasconsiderations should apply as for written articles, 1. e.if granted, an interview should be confined to elucidatingthe policy or work of the Minister and Department concerned.The same considerations regarding obligations to Parliamentalso apply, and Ministers should bear in mind that aninterview granted to a representative of a single newspaperor agency may arouse jealousy and thus hostility in therest of the Press.(CP. (49)95* paragraph 49).In 1943, the Prime Minister(Mr. Churchill) refused permission to theSecretary of State for War (Sir James Origg)to give an interview to a representative ofthe &quot;Sunday Times&quot; on certain aspects ofmilitary operations and administration on thegrounds that &quot;the practice of giving inter-views to particular newspapers is to bedeprecated.   It nearly always results inunfriendly reaction by the majority of thePress.   It becomes very serious if a lot ofauthoritative new matter of this kind is putforth by a single Department............&quot;(Prime Minister1s Minute of 29th October,1943,Pile 4/1/23).   Nevertheless a number of otherMinisters gave interviews to the &quot;Sunday Times113        suburb o  2*^^43*The current ruling was originally givenin Movember, 1945 (CP.(45)310).37 Ho instructions have been issued on the holding ofPress conferences by Ministers.   Such conferences are nowan accepted means of giving the public information on awide range of subjects;   and some Ministers (s*g. theChancellor of the Bachequer and the Minister of Pood)have regular conferences.   It is now also a regular practiceto hold a Lobby Correspondents&apos; conference on thepublication of any important Government Bill.   Parliament,is however, quick to question any Minister who, while theHouse is in session, makes any important policy statementat a press conference and not In the House.OB 2nd February, 1946 the Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee)said in reply to a Question: -&quot;Both methods of public announcement  T.e. at newsconferences and is Parliament/ are appropriate accordingto the circumstances and to the nature of the statement,end the Government must reserve a reasonable measure ofdiscretion ss to which method Is employed.   The House maybe assured, however, that the Government have every wishand intention to recognise to the full their constitutionalresponsibilities to the House of Commons, and on allappropriate occasions, statements will bs mads in thisHouse.&quot;   (Hansard, Houss of Commons, Cols. 1465-6).
Repilea to letters and statements In the Press5$ The current notes on procedure state x-Possible methods of dealing vith letters and statementsto the Press which are inaccurate or other-vise objectionableare set out In CP. (47)178.    The general line to be takenwas stated In the Prime Minister*s reply to a question onSth October. 1946:-&quot;It should be, I think, a general rule that, where thepersonal conduct of Ministers is concerned, the matter shouldbe dealt with by the Minister himself.1&apos;   (Hansard. Vol. 427*Ool. 25),and the reply given by Mr. Churchill in the House on22nd February, 1945:-&quot;The best practice is that Ministers of the Crown shouldthemselves expound all matters of Government policy, and thatpress Interviews by officials should only be given onMinisterial responsibility and after due authorisation by thepolitical chief.     Such expressions of opinion by officialswould usually have regard to technical aspects only.     Ofco rse, in an emergency, exceptions may be made.     Theprinciple of Ministerial responsibility to Parliament Isparamount&quot;   (Hansard, Vol. 408, Col. 954).Letters to the Press from Information Offloors shouldbe purely Informative and must not enter into arguments onthe merits of Government policy.(CP. (49)95, paragraph 62).
DirectorshipsDirectorships held by Ministers are subject to a rulingoriginally laid down by Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman inMarch. 1906 and endorsed in principle by successive PrimeMinisters.     The essential part of this ruling is:-&quot;The condition which was laid down on the formationof tbe Government was that all directorships held by Ministersmust be resigned except in the case of honorary directorshipsin connection with philanthropic undertakings and directorshipsin private companies.&quot;The last statement of the ruling was by Mr. Chamberlain inreply to a Parliamentary Question on 31st July, 1939 (Hansard.House of Commons, Col. 1937-8): it is the responsibilityof the Prime Minister of the day to be the final judge ofwhether any particular directorship comes within the rulingor not.     .ri copy of tbe   uest on and Answer is circulated bythe Prisas Minister&apos;s Private Secretary to every new Minister,including the Assistant -hips (Unpaid).   This matter is handledin 10, Downing Street, with the advice where necessary of theTreasury Solicitor.For Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s statement, which wasdiscussed in draft by the Cabinet on 5th July,1939 (Cab. 35(39)3), see Pile U/lA;No. 10, Downing Street Handbook, p.     ;Jennings, pp. 85-6.For this purpose private companies areregarded as concerns dealing wholly or mainlywith family affairs or Interests and notprimarily engaged in trading.On the position of Ministers as practisingsolicitors see Hansard, House of Commons, .10th June, 1937, Col. 1949-50;   5th July, 1938,Col. 182-3.When Mr. James Stewart was appointed ChiefGovernment ..hip in the Coalition Government hewas acting as a half-coxnmission agent on theStock Exchange.     At his request his positionwas considered in consultation with the TreasurySolicitor, and he was advised that it was amatter entirely for his own discretionwhether or not not he should give up his StockExchange activities.     He did in fact give themup.    (S. and P. 2UM).
ShareholdingWhile no specific rules are laid down, it is understoodthat Ministers ought not to enter into any transaction whore-by their direct pecuniary interest might come into conflictwith their public duty, or where their special informationmight even appear to give then an advantage over otherpeople. e.g. making speculative investments depending on ananticipation of market changes.For general statements of the principlesee No. 10, Downing Street Handbook, File k/l/kHansard, House of Commons, 19th June, 1913,Cols. 556-7 (statement by Mr. Asquith); forfurther Parliamentary answers, see Hansard,House of Commons, 18th May, 1939, Col. 1618;11th December, 1947, Col. 1193.
Pit-rcct Pajrawnvi frwa Traflg ph4?rsla April, 1946, Mr. Attlee ruled that Ministers(Including Junior Ministers and Assistant whips (unpaid) shouldnot receive direct payments from Trade Unions.For text of memorandum see No. 10 DowningStreet Handbook, p. 24.Acceptance of, Giftsi etc.A general statement of the principles which shouldgovern the conduct of Ministers iincluding Junior Ministers)was made by the Prime Minister in the course of the debate onthe Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into allegationsagainst certain Ministers and officials.    See Cmd. 7616:Hansard, House of Commons, 3rd February, 1949, (Cols. 1846-1964).   See also the report of the Committee on PersonalApplications circulated with a note by the Prime Ministeron 1st July, 1949. vProfit? from fitgBW inyepnoatAlthough a Minister is free to take cut a provisionalpatent and a final patent for an invention he is not entitledto claim any financial benefit from the use of the inventionin the United Kingdom while holding an office which mightin any way be concerned with the use of tbe invention.In 1941, Colonel Moore-Brabazon, whenMinister of Transport, asked whether he could apph.for a patent for an invention which be had madefor overcoming the vibrations of railway carrlageiand railway lines.     The question was consideredby the Attorney-General and the TreasurySolicitor.    It was decided that while theMinister was free to take out a provisionalpatent and a final patent, he should not beentitled while still Minister of Transportto claim any financial benefit from the useof the invention in this country. -   As regardsforeign patents, the Treasury Solicitor held thatthere was no restriction that could be placedon the Minister1s taking out foreign patentsand enjoying the income which might resulttherefrom.     Colonel Moore-Brabazon decided totake no further steps in the matter for thetime being.     (See S. and P. 10/4/41).
VOTIHG IS DIVISIONS IS W E008B OFCOMMONSThe principle of collective responsibility requires thatmembers of the Government must support the Government inParliament.     Exceptionally, on certain matters of conscience,the Cabinet have decided that a Minister may abstain fromvoting.See generally Jennings, pp. 221-2;Anson, Vol. 11(1), pp. 117-19, 144-45.For the &quot;agreement to differ&quot; of 1932see Cab. 7(32) and Jennings, pp. 219-20.     Theofficial announcement included the followingpassage:-&quot;It (the Cabinet) has accordingly determinedthat some modification of usual Ministerialpractice is required, and has decided thatMinisters who find themselves unable tosupport the conclusions arrived at by themajority of their colleagues on the subject ofimpo rt   duties and cognate matters, are tobe at liberty to express their views by speechand vote&quot;.In 1936, the Prime Minister (Mr. Baldwin)drew the Cabinet&apos;s attention to the fact thatin a division in the House of Commons on1st April when the Government was defeated,23 members were absent, and said that he intendedto send a request to all Ministers &quot;to workas much as possible in their offices in theHouse of Commons when the House was sitting.The presence of Ministers in the Housealways had a good effect on the rank and fileof the Party and their absence exercised exactlythe contrary effect&quot;.    (CM.28(36)1).When the Ministers of the Crown Bill wasunder consideration by the Cabinet in 1937 itwas agreed that Ministers holding appointments,the salaries attached to which were increasedby the Bill, should refrain from voting in theParliamentary Divisions on the appropriate clausesand that all members of the Government shouldsupport the provision in the bill for providinga salary for the Leader of the Opposition.(CM. 19 (37) 6).In a note by the Secretary to the Cabineton a request by the Prime Minister thatMinisters should be present in the House fora particular vote It is stated &quot;it is usualin cases such as the above for CabinetMinisters to communicate the Prime Minister^wishes to their Under-Secretaries&quot;.   (CM.29(38)3)In March 1941, after the decision that aprayer against the Defence Regulation alreadymade enabling theatres and music-halls to beopen on Sunday, should be left to the free voteof the House, it was Agreed by the Cabinet thatno Minister or Junior Minister should vote
for the prayer against the Regulations althoughhe might abstain from voting.   (W.M.33(41)10).When the abolition of capital punishmentwas under discussion the Cabinet agreed on3rd November, 1947 that the question shouldbe left to a free vote when it came up on tbeReport Stage of the Criminal Justice Bill(CM. 84(47)1).     On 18th NoTember, they agreedthat Parliament should be advised that thetime was not opportune for abolishing capitalpunishment, but they decided/Ministers whodissented from the advice tor be given toParliament shovdd be free, if they so desired,to vote for abolition, though they shouldrefrain from expressing in debate views contraryto that advice.   (CM.89(47)4).   The issuewas reconsidered on the 9tb April, 1948when it was decided that mettbers of the Government(including Law Officers and Junior Ministers)who felt unable, on grounds of conscience, tovote against abolition, should abstain fromvoting.    (0.11,27(48)2).     In the event, on15th April, 1948 there wes carried, againstGovernment advice^a new clause abolishing thedeath penalty for an experimental period offive years.    Of 72 members of the Governmentin the House of Commons 28 voted against the newclause and 44 took no part in tbe division.See Pile 22/1/46.
Tbe Cabinet Office may from time to time be asked toprovide a secretary to make a record of tbe proceedings whendeputations are received by the Prime Minister, or whenmeetings are held between Ministers and representatives ofnon-Governmental bodies.     Arrangements may also be made bythe Prime Minister*s Private Secretary for the attendanceof a Treasury shorthand reporter.For examples of the records of suchmeetings prepared by the Cabinet Office seeFile 21/1/13.In reply to a Question on 30th March, 1943the Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill) said &quot;Thereis no constitutional obligation upon  Ministersto receive any particular deputations whetherheaded by members of Parliament or not;   Ibelieve, however, that the practice of Ministersin making themselves as accessible as possible tomembers of this House works smoothly and thatthere are no serious reasons for departing fromour usual methods.&quot;   (Hansard, House of Commons,Cols. 31-33).
