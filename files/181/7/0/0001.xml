For the constitutional aspects of the relation betweentho King and the Cabinet aad Ministers generally aeeJennings (e.g. pp.1 264-275);   Anson (s.g. Vol. II(l) pp. 139-141).a*l^tti*&amp;lJLlUfll Pf IbjB gafalflCt OfficeThe Prime Minister has special responsibilities for thetransaction of business with tho Crown, by formal and Informalsubmission and by audience.     He is also responsible foreeelng that the King is kept informed of important developmentsaffecting the administration;   and hie Private Secretaryworks in very close contact with the King&apos;8 Private Secretary.The main concern of the Cabinet Offloo la to see, under thedirection of the Prime Minister, that the King is providedwith the documents of the Cabinet and lta main Committees.The Cabinet Offioe have no direct responsibility forinforming the Palace of mattore arising from the proceedingsof the Cabinet.    Normally specific developments are mentioned tothe King by the Prime Uinieter or to the Klng*o Private Secretaryby the Prime Ministers Private oecretary. . On grounds ofconvenience, however, it is sometimes arranged, in consultationwith the Prime Minister1! Private Secretary, that the Seoretaryof the Cabinet should inform the King&apos;a Private secretary ofdevelopments arising from the Cabinet&apos;s proceedings.   Likewisethe Klng*s Private Secretary may occasionally aak theSecretary of the Cabinet immediately after a Cabinet meeting(and in advance of the preparation of the minutes) forinformation on acme point discussed.
9 In addition to the memoranda and minutes of the Cabinetthe King receives regularly the memoranda and minutes of themore important Committees of the Cabinet (see page 5*  ).The minutes of the Cabinet carry a formal constitutionalsignificance as representing the Cabinet*s advice to the King.How far the minutes of Cabinet Committees carry the asmsformal significance has not been determined, but forpractical purposes the minutes of Ministerial Oomuiitteee mostbe treated as on much the same footing as the minutes ofthe Cabinet, so long as these Com dttees are regarded ashaving sufficient authority to enable then to take on theCabinet&apos;s behalf decisions on matters of policy engagingthe collective responsibility cf the Government as a whole.Zt follows from this that if a meeting of a MinisterialCommittee whose papers are regularly received by the Kingis held without the presence of the Secretariat and withoutthe subsequent preparation of a record of the proceedings, itwould probably be necessary for the Prime Ministsr or othersenior Minister particularly concerned to see the Kingand to give him an account of the proceedings in the same wayas the Chancellor of the Exchequer sees the King after sBudget Cabinet, the proceedings of which are not recorded.On the other hand if the reason for dispensing with Routesis not so ..aich the need for secrecy in Itself as the fact thatthe discussion is mainly political in character, the rightcourse would be to hold an informal meeting of Ministers whichwould not in form be a meeting of any Cabinet Committee.In June, 19k9 it was arranged that initialdiscussion of certain msmoraada submitted tothe Economic Policy Committee should be taJtJsnat an informal meeting of Ministers immediatelypreoeedlng a formal meeting of that Committee.See minutes in ts and r.ss

This is a long-standing rule, butthe extent to which it has been followed has varied from tizasto tiu*e.    Circumstances lo which it is or has been  heldnecessary to obtain the Klng&apos;s consent are (1) disclosuresof Cabinet proceedings in personal statements made inParliament by Ministers on their reasons for resigning;(11) disclosure in private publications;   and (iil) disclosureof the documents or one aduinlstration to a succeedingadministration^dee generally Jennings, pp. 206-210;Anson, Vol. 11(1) pp. 121-2.On statements by Ministers en resignationPart II, p. ff .On toe extent to which the Ling&apos;s consent isobtained to disclosure of Cabinet proceedings andto quotation of Cabinet documents in privatepublications oes Part VIII.On the question of the Klng&apos;s consent todisclosure of documents of one administration toa succeeding administration see Part IV p.

Thus in 1947, en theappointment of the Economic Policy Committee, itwas decided that copies of its documents shouldbe sent to the King.    In 1945 It was agreedwith the Palace that the documents of theLegislation Committee (which the King had receivedsince September, 1939) should no longer beincluded and that the documents of the overseasReconstruction Committee should be added to theliat.Since the appointment of the War Cabinetin December. 1916 the King has always receiveda copy of the Cabinet Conclusions.     Until   ofa1939 the King&apos;s copy waa sent (from the Cabiaey)under cover of a submission^ initialled by theSecretary of the Cabinet in the sense that&quot;The Prime Minister presents his humble dutyto Bis Majesty the King and has the honourto enclose herewith a copy of the Conclusionsof a Meeting of the Cabinet held on....&quot;When, in the absence of the Prime Minister,another Minister presided at the meeting, thesubmission was sent in that Minister&apos;8 name.On the history of Cabinet Minutes and thePrisLO Minister&apos;e personal letter to the Kingsee references given in Part I p.      .    xThe King received copies of the Minutesand Memoranda of the Committee of ImperialDefence from its establishment in 1904.     The
types of Committee documents received navevaried from time to time with the changingimportance of particular Committees.Before the Second World War it wascustomary when a Cabinet memorandum affectedthe King personally for an advance copy to besent to his ?ri*ate Secretary.    dee PileV3/83.    It Is now the normal practicethat, when matters affecting the Kingpersonally are to be dealt with in Cabinetdocuments, the proposals are first mentionedto the King by the   Prime Minister.
The King receives copies of Cabinet Agenda;   and thereis a standing arrangement under which the Private secretaryto the secretary of the Cabinet informs the hlng&apos;s PrivateSecretary of the calling of special meetings of the Oablnetfor which, in view of the abort notice, no Agenda papershave been issued.Cabinet Committee Agenda andmiscellaneous documents ouch as &quot;BlackLists&quot; are not sent.The King is sent by the Cabinet Office copies ofCommonwealth Relations Offioe telegrams circulated to theCabinet.     Copies of Foreign Offioe telegrams and despatchesare sent direct to the Palace by the Foreign Office.
Documents for the King are despatched to the ialaeeby Blank Box on the ordinary distributions from theCabinet Offlee.When the  lug is out of London boxes continue to besent to Buckingham Palace, where the contents are sortedand important papers despatched to the King.    In thesecireumstanoes the Palace sometimes ask for adjustments inthe times of delivery.   Bee Pile 4/3/83.The printed versions of the Cabinet Conclusions areretained for preservation in the Royal Archives at Windsorwhere a complete eet of Conclusions is on record.   Otherdocuments are normally returned in due course to theCabinet Office.   See Pile 4/3/83*
&apos;0.     Since 1936 it has been the practice for certain Cabinet papers tobe sent to the person next in succession to the throne.    Thus, on theaccession of King adward VIII in 1936 the Cabinet agreed that the Dukeof York should receive the same Cabinet and Committee of ImperialDefence papers as the ling, except Cabinet minutes and those Committeeof Imperial Defence papers which were given a restricted circulation(Cabinet 57 (36) 22 and file 4/3/86).     The same arrangement was made,with the Cabinet&apos;s approval, for the Duke of Gloucester when he becamethe person of full age next in succession to the throne (Cabinet 16(37) 1 end file 4/3/2), but it was discontinued when the Duke becameGovernor-General of Australia and was not resumed on his return to theUnited Kingdom, since by then Princess Elizabeth had come of age.    InJune, 1950, the Prime Minister, without reference to the Cabinet,authorised the issue of Cabinet minutes and memoranda to PrincessElizabeth.   It was thought to be unsatisfactory, and even misleading,to send her Cabinet memoranda without the relevant minutes, and anarrangement   as made whereby Her Royal Highness received Cabinetminutes (but not Confidential Annexes) as they were issued, each setbeing accompanied by copies of the memoranda discussed at the meeting.(Pile 4/3/329).The initiative in arranging for Cabinet papers to be sent to theheir to the throne has been taken in the past by the Palace.   TheKing&apos;s Private Secretary would normally first put the proposalinformally to the Secretary of the Cabinet, who would make arecommendation to the Prime Minister.   The Prime Minister would then, ifhe approved, discuss the matter with the King, who would have beenwarned by his Private Secretary to expect this approach.   It wouldbe for the Prime Minister to decide whether to mention the proposalto his colleagues.In 1928, it was arranged that the Prince of Wales and theDuke of York should receive from the Cabinet Office copiesof the papers normally circulated at that time to DominionHigh Commissioners in London, i.e.   certain DominionsOffice telegrams and Foreign Office prints.   See   File 4/3/2 Ft LIn November, 1946, it was agreed by the Prime Minister that,during the King&apos;s absence in South Africa, the Duke ofGloucester, as senior member of the Council of State, shouldsee all the documents normally sent to the King.See   File 10/3/25.J* July, lf*7, fea Private Secretary te fee Puke of COouoestsrasked wbwfeer fee Duke ee 3d fee previdad with CcmraonwealthRelations Office telegrams set certain Permian Of flee telegramssad prints,   fas Cabinet Office mere soaaalted beta by feeDuke*s private Seerstsry sad lay fee Cesacawealfe RelationsOffice, primarily ea fee aawetlsa whether any CommonwealthRelation Office telegrams te be provided would to seat freefee Qaafeet Office or direct,   The rejdy was feat there was asObjection so far as fee Cabfeet Office was ooanaraoa, oat featfee deeuaeats should as seat direct since ofeer deeaasata wereact betas sent to the Date.

The question see not in fact since been &quot;raised la respect of the Duke of Gloucester,In -July, 1^47, however, tho Duko&apos;a Privateaeoru aif: aakod whether the Duke could beprovided with Commonwealth Relations Officetelegrams and certain Foreign Offioe telegramsand prints.    The Cabinet office wereconsulted both by the Duke&apos;a Private secretaryand by the Commonwealth delations Offioe,primarily on the question whether anyCommonwealth Relations Office telegrams to be .provided would be sent from tee Cabinet Offioeor direct.    The reply waa that there waa noobjection ao far as tho Cabinet Office wasconcerned, but that the documents fhouLd liesent direct since other dodUmenta feiv Jhatbeing sent to the Duke, ft Bp Pfreigju Of fleelikewise agreed to provide the Duke direct withcertain telegrams.     bee File 4/3/66*^        7T
When the King le in London the Prime Minister normallynee a weekly audience, usually on ths afternoon of Tuesday,although special arrangements may be made from tins to timeto Inform the King at onee of important developments,vhen the King le out of London the Prime Minister may writeto him.In 1948 a regular practice was introduced underwhich the secretary of the Cabinet sends to the Prime Minister1private Secretary (usually on the Monday proceeding theaudience; a note of points arising from the proceedings of theCabinet and Cabinet Committees which the Prime Minister maywleh to mention to the King.    In the light of these notesand of other notes made in 10, downing street, the PrimsMinister&apos;s Privets secretary prepares a short aide-memoirefor the Prime Minister&apos;s use.In November, 1938 vhen the King hadexpressed hie desire to receive before thePrime Minister&apos;s weekly audience a note of theconclusions of the lateet meeting of the Cabinetit was arranged, with the Prime Minister&apos;sapproval, that a oopy of the flret draft ofthe Cabinet Conclusions should be sent to theKing at the earns tins ae to the Prime Minister.The draft conclusions were returned to theCabinet Office on reoeipt of the approved text.See File W83.In March, 1939 it was arranged that enadvance copy of the draft Minutes of theCommittee of Imperial Defence should likewisebe sent to the King.     See File h/3/83.In November, 1945, vhen the first Cabinetmeeting of the week was normally on Tuesdaymorning, the Klng&apos;e Private secretary askedwhether the secretary of the Cabinet couldprepare a very short summary of the conclusionswhich the King could have the earns afternoonprior to the Prime Minister &apos;s audience.    Beforea decision was taken on this question theCabinst had agreed to meet regularly onMonday rather than Tuesday.    See File 4/3/83.
While the normal channel of communication ie from thePrime Minister to the King or the Prime Minister&apos;s PrivateSecretary to the Klag&apos;s Private Secretary, it is semstimssarranged, on grounds of convenience, that the Secretary of theCabinet should inform the Klng&apos;s Private Secretary of partieulsdevelopments arising from the Cablnetfc proceedings.    .^gainthe King&apos;e Private Secretary may himself approach theSecretary of the Cabinet.    Unless the request is merely/for information on points of detail, the Prime -initte^sPrivate Secretary Is always kept Informed of such approachee.In February, 1938, at the time sf Mr.  den&apos;s]*      resignation from the Foreign Office.the Kingasked that arrangements should bs made toenable him to receive immediate informationof any serious developments of the kind.    HisPrivate Secretary said (lstter of 21st February,1938)i   &quot;In the ordinary course the inevitabledelay between a Cabinet meeting and the receiptby His Majesty of the Minutes is of no oonssqueocOn the otner hand, when a Meeting results ina critical situation from which rapid developments!are to bs anticipated, there is no regularmachinery in existence for putting His Majestyin posseeslon of foots which it is right andproper that the Sovereign should know.     Italso follows that any opportunity for HisMajesty tc i&amp;uue a helpful contribution of anykind, in consultation with hie Prime Minister,is delayed until the situation has becomeirretrievable and intervention useless&quot;.It was subsequently arranged thet the King*sPrlvata secretary, the Prime Minister^ PrivateSecretary and the Secretary of the Cabinetshould keep a very close touch generally.    Inparticular the   Secretary of the Cabinet undertook]to remind the i rims Minister, as occasion aroseof his responsibility to Inform the King.See File k/l/GA Part 1.
In September, 1939 special arrangemente sere mippXy confidential operational information to the king daily,ity officer from the Cabinet War Boom attended albwmrlnghsm Palace every morning with a copy of the dailySituation Report which he brought back on return.     Thedally Situation Rej?ort. was later supplemented by the Chiefsof Staff weekly iteeume: naval information in the dailyJUMmaries was amplified personally by ths Naval Duty Officer.In April, 1940 it was arranged that the Joint IntelligenceCommittee&apos;a Situation Report should bs ssnt to the Palaceand, after it bad been seen by the King and his PrivateSecretary, burnt.See Pile 48/2/2.In July. 1942 the Prime Minister(Mr. Churchill) stated that the King shouldalways be given all information about futureoperations, however secret.
When it ie proposed that the King should make a visitoutslds the Doited Kingdom ths Prime Minister Informs theCabinet, and consideration is given to the question whethera Council of state (in terms of the Regency Act, 1937 asemended by the Regency Act, 1943) will be necessary duringthe Klng&apos;a absence.     The Cabinet Office have no responsibilityin this matter.     If it ie deolded that a Council of state isnecessary, ths procedure is broadlyt-(a) Parliamentary Counsel prepares draft Letters Patent;(b) The draft is submitted to the Palace for the Klng&apos;aapproval;(e)   On approval by the King the draft le returned to theLord Chancellor^ Office to prepare the documentfor signaturej(d) Letters Patent are returned to Palace for signature](e) Letters Patent are signed and returned to^ordChancellor&apos;s Office, who are responsible forobtaining the Home Secretaryfs signature andInforming thoee who have to take action.See Ana on, Vol. 11(1) pp. 273-4,Pile 32/152.If the circumstances require spools! secrecythe Initial mention at Cabin t of a proposedvisit overseas is not recorded in the CabinetMinutes, although the Secretary of the Cabinetmay make a &quot;no circulation&quot; record.Counsellors of State were appointed duringthe King&apos;s visit to Canada and ths Unltsd statesin 1939 and t i South Africa in 1947.The procedure was, however, not adoptedduring his short visit to France in 1939* inview of ths seoreey of the visit and of thetime required to prepare Letters Patent;   ifit had been necessary to hold a meeting of thePrivy Council it would have been held inFrance.    oee File 32/152.When the King visited Morth Africa in19U3, the War Cabinet agreed (W.H. 83(43),uncirculated minute of 9th June, 1943)that it was desirable to have a Council ofState to avoid any delay in the execution ofurgent business even though the ..ing&apos;e absence weenot expected to exeeed a fortnight.For a copy of the Letters Patent in respectof the Council of otate during ths Klng*sabsence in south Africa in 1947 and notes onthe procedure for submissions to the Counciland the King see File 10/8/25/2.On the occasion of the visit to SouthAfrica the King asked that Ministers whointended going outside the United Kingdomshould obtain the consent of the Council ofutate (through the Duke of Gloucester asleading Counssllor)   See File 10/8/25/2.(letter of 31st January, 1947) and Part II p. ft  ,
Soring the King*s visits abroad the Cabinet Offiee,in consultation with the king*8 Private secretary and withthe Departments concerned and with the general approval ofthe Prime Minister, are responsible for thespeolalarrangements required for oo..l ainication with him and for theprovision^ of information.    The precise arrangements forcommunicating general Information to the King vary with thecircumstances of the visit, but broadly they provide forsending to him by telegram or by air mail -(a) summarlee of matters discussed by the Cabinet and bythe Cabinet Committees whose documents the Kingnormally sees;(b) general information on foreign affairs in the fontof Foreign Office or Com. ionwealth delations Offieetelegrams!(o) a weekly letter from the Prime Minister.In addition the arrangements cover eoawmnicatione withthe King on matters which cannot be dealt with by theCouncil of State.He Cabinet documents as such are sent to the King overseas.For any prolonged visit a detailed communications plan Isrequired and the preparation of it needs to be commenced somesix months before the King&apos;s departure.    When the arrangementshave been finally agreed it is usual for the Prime Ministerto circulate  a note to the Cabinet for general information.For details of arrangements see File10/4/15 (visit to Canada and the United Statesin 1939) 1   10/8/25 (south Africa, 1947) I1Q/4/40 (proposed visit to New Zealand andAustralia, 1949)*In December, 1939 when the Kingvisited O.H.Q. in France he received a dallysummary of War Cabinet conclusions sent byKing*s Messenger,

The British constitution le unwritten and is built up onpractice and precedent over very many years.    Ite procedurele well defined in some respects;   in others less so;   newsituations arise and to meet them there are modifications,often imperceptible, which in themselves beeome precedentsand part of established practice.     For these reasons it isimpossible in many eases to be dogmatic on broad constitutionalissues, and it may well be ml pleading to   say, for example,that &quot;the King must do this&quot; or that &quot;the Prime Minister oustdo that.&quot;    It will often be found that there is an exceptionor that an exception can be made which in itself will provea precedent.Therefore, to define in precise terms the general relation-ship between the King and the Prime Minister is difficult evenif the matter were to be set out at length.    It is impossibleto do so in a few paragraphs.    What follows is only a briefand simplified outline of the main principles of thisrelationship.The British monarchy is hereditary and constitutional,the King being head of the State.    Hereditary explains itselfbut constitutional needs some explanation.     The first mainpoint to note is that under this system Ministers must beprepared to assume responsibility for every act or omissionof the King which has any political significance.    This isa fundamental constitutional doctrine and it follows ae anecessary corollary that on all such matters Ministers have theright to tender advice.    This is the basis of the well-established tradition that in the last resort the Lingaccepts the advlee of hie Ministers, although this does notin any way derogate from his right and indeed duty to makeknown to ministers his views about or objections to anycourse of action they propose.On general matters the   lag is advised by the PrimeMinister, and on matters afteeting only individual Departmentsof State by the Minister in charge of that Department.It will be noted that Ministers are responsible not onlyfor every act but also for any omission of the King whichhas political significance, and Ministers cannot avoidresponsibility in any particular case by not choosing to tenderadvice.     This would be a deliberate decision on their partand therefore they would still remain responsible.     It mayalso be asked tow it is possible to decide whether any actor omission will have political significance.     This is notordinarily in doubt and borderline eaeee can be adjusted by theexercise of tolerance and commonsense.     On the whole,however, the tendency has been to regard more and more mattersas having political significance.The second main point which requires noting about the impliestions of constitutional monarchy in this country is that theking should not take sides in party polities.     This was notobserved even so late as the middle of the last century.     Butit is now an accepted principle of the monarchy in thiscountry, and Indeed one of its great strengths, that the Kingnot only does not take sides but is clearly seen to beimpartial.     This, however, in no way affects the positionthat the King is entitled to expect the support of hisMinisters where he has acted on advice and similarly thatMinisters in their turn are entitled to expect the confidenceof the King.    Eaturally the relationship between the PrimeMinister and the King   la closer than that of any other Minister.
Toe choice of a Prime Minister fey the king is not madeon formal advice or euoiaisaioos.     In many caaes the choice isclear, but the King has an absolute right in all cases toconsult anyone he pleases.     This right may of course be ofthe greatest value in cases where there is doubt about thechoice;   such as in the event of the death of a Prime Ministerin oflice, the resignation of the Prime Minister for personalreasons, a complicated political situation, and so forth.Bevertheless, as the King should not exercise, or appearto exercise, any political bias, he would normally chooseas i riiue Minister the leader of the Party having the largestnumber of seats in the House of Commons.     Customarily hewould make hie choice in a clear case of this kind withoutany overt or personal consultations, as such consultationsmight Imply political partisanship..vhlle there is no constitutional bar to the choice of aPeer as Prime Minister no such choice has in fact been madesince the end of Lord Salisbury*s administration in 1902, andthe passing over in 1923 of Lord Curzon in favour ofLord (then Mr.) Baldwin may possibly mark a constitutionalconvention excluding a Poor from being Prime Minister.The Prime Minister himself recommends to the King thosewhom he proposes for appointment to the Ministerial offloecomprising the Government.    Squally the Prime Minister himselfrecommends any changes in Office or any dismissals from Office.Although the nomination of Ministers rests with thePrime Minister, the King may exercise a considerable influence;but, being a constitutional monarch, he la bound In theultimate resort to accept the advice of the Prime Minister, orfind another Prime Minister who can commend the support of theHouse of Commons or the country.    There are no knowncases in recent years when the King has in the final resort notaccepted a recommendation of the Prime Minister for the appoint-meat of a minister.In selecting the members of hie administration the PrimeMinister Is not bound to consult anyone, though normally hewould consult other leading members of his Party.    TheCabinet as such, however, has no right to be consulted, butthe Prime Minister la perfectly free to do eo if he wishes.
