1*    The association of the Cabinet Office with the handlingof General Election business has coneisted in its providingthe secretariat for successive Emergency Business Comuittees.There is a long tradition behind this practices   since 1923it has been the custom of the administration in office atthe time of a general election to appoint an StaergencyBusiness Committee to advise on points of policy arisingduring the election campaign,2.    The scope of the successive Committees will be seenfrom the attached note.    Their membership has includedpersons other than members of the Government and theirpapers have been circulated to Party Officers, but theyhave functioned as Cabinet Committees.3.     The method of work may be summarised briefly,   -at thebeginning of the campaign the Cabinet has appointed aCommittee of Ministers or of Ministers and Party officersto advise in particular on the answers to be given toQuestionnaires sent to Ministers and other Governmentcandidates.    In association with the Cabinet Committee therehas usually been a non-official committee representing theParty organisation or organisations supporting the Government,uestions and questionnaires received by the Party head-quarters have been collated by officers of the Partyorganisation, who have been responsible for preparing a draftreply.    The questions and draft replies have then been sentto the Cabinet Office and the comments of Departments there-after obtained.    Proposed replies have then come beforethe l&amp;asrgeacy Business Committee for approval.      Once approvalhas been given the Party organisation has been responsiblefor passing on the necessary guidance, important answers beingCirculated to all Candidates^    4a- ae*T-i*-wae-ds^ae&amp;-eR-*hename of the Emergency Business Committees have beencharged with handling matters which but for the electionwould have been dealt with by the Cabinet, but in practicetheir work has almost entirely been concerned specifically withthe election Campaign, in fact, it was decided on the appointment ofthe 1950 Committee lo adopt the title &quot;Election Business Committee&quot;.4,    The work falling on Departments and in particular theCabinet Office will be seen from statistics relating to1945.     The Saergeney business Committee met seven timesbetween 14th June, 1945 and 28th June, 1945s   thesubstantive minutes run, on average to 3l pages.     Memorandanumber 99,    Altogether 120 documents were referred to theCabinet Office by the Conservative Central Office cove.inga vast array of topics large and small (from seamen&apos;s welfareto Palestine policy);   and for comments or alternativesuggested replies 13 Departments were called upon from6 to over 20 tines each, 3 Departments from 3 to 6 times, and9 Departments once or twice.     Comments and suggested replieshad necessarily to be called for at very short notice,5.    The practice in the General Election of October, 1924,when the Labour Government went to the polls was similarto that adopted in 1923 and in later years.    Most of ourexperience in this matter has, however, been with Conservativeor predominantly Conservative Governmentsj   and theConservative Central Office, in 1935 and in 1945* seems tohave made ver^ full use of the Cabinet Office,       ithoutmachinery such as that created on past occasions it would be
7.    The Election Business Coaaittee of January/February, 1950* hadlittle to do and met only twice.    This lack of activity was thought tobe due to:-(i)   the reluctance of Labour Party Headquarters to sake use ofthe Committee, for which they felt no great need;(ii)   the instructs^ issued by the Labour Party Executive to theircandidates not to answer questionnaires;(iii)   the nature of the Election, which ems fought on broad generalissues and gave rise to few miscellaneous points.Despite this experience, hocever, it was thought in the CabinetOffice that it would be right to propose the appointment of an ElectionBusiness Committee in connection with the next General Election - for itcould not be assumed that the same conditions would obtain at futureElections, and, from the official point of view, the main purpose of theCoaaittee is to enable Departments to point out what awkward conse-    \quences sight follow if candidates committed themselves to supportparticular lines of policy pressed upon them in their constituencies.Points to be watched are:-(a) Departments oust not be allowed to use the Committee as aweans of communicating general lines of policy to Governmentcandidates, and thus as a sort of super-Party Executive.(b) If an Election Business Committee is set up its existenceshould be announced as far in advance as possible.    Onthis occasion separate notes had to be issued by the PrimeMinister, before the Committee had been set up, about (i)the need for candidates to go direct to party Headquartersfor information justifying Government policy, and (ii) theextent to which Government Departments should go in pro-viding factual information for candidates;   and there wassome confusion about the relation of these instructions toeach other and to the work of the Election BusinessCommittee.
difficult to avoid duplication and confusion.    The PartyOrganisation, (and indeed individual members of theGovernment) usually find it necessary to seek guidance fromDepartments on a vide variety of issues (for the most partnot essentially &apos;political&apos;) and co-ordination by theCabinet Office seems preferable to direct approaches byTransport House to Departments and a large and uncontrolledmass of correspondence between Private Secretaries.     (Itmay be noted that in 1935 questions sere initially referreddirect b^ the Conservative Central Office to Departments;   itwas soon found desirable to make all references through theCabinet Office).6.     Since a Government which goes to the polls does so as aGovernment it is entitled in its campaign to make use of theinformation and advice available to it, and objection couldclearly not be taken to the adoption of arrangements   similarto those made on previous occasions, if the Government sodesired.    Indeed in the past the Cabinet office seems forthe most part to have taken the initiative by remindingMinisters of the traditional practice.   That practiceclearly represents the most which we or Departments can beexpected to do.    In particular a stand needs to betaken against any request for the preparation by Departmentsof &apos;apologetic&apos; memoranda for election purposes!   some suchpapers -ere prepared in 1924, but it was agreed that theircirculation should be confined to Ministers and they werenot ...ade available to tthe Part; Organisation.Motes    See File 7/2/6  tart 2.

For this purpose hehad been sent a copy of the Committee&apos;e draft report aad ofall its papers up to that date.    The Committee itself had beesset up as a result of a letter which Mr. Balfour had writtento the Secretary of the CI.D. (Sir 0* Clarke) suggesting thatthe former conclusions of the Committee of Imperial Defencerequired revision la the light of the possibility that attackmight be from Germany rather than from France.2.    On 13th January, 1913* a Standing Committee of the C.I.D.bbs appointed to consider what new factors had arisen laconnection with oversea attack on the United Kingdom.   TheChairman of the Committee waa the Prime Minister (Mr. Asoalth);the other members included nine other Ministers departmentallyconcerned, with lbs Chiefs of staff, Mr. Balfour and Lord Kaher.3* In 191W5 Mr. Balfour waa a member of the war Council;on 10th March, 1915 Mr. Boner Law, Leader of the Opposition,and Lord Lanodowao attended a meeting of the war Council.h.

In view ofthe fact that the prospect of co-operation with the Oppositionwaa slight and of the possibility that the procedure mightcause public alarm, the moral view of the Cabinet waa opposedto such consultations.   (Cab. 26(35)10)*9* Ob 6th July, 1936, the Cabinet had a long discussion obi^^jaeotioB^of ^ copanltaticn        tho^O^osltlon^and leadingto the Chancellor of the Chequer (Mr. Seville Chamberlain)and to the Chief Aip the possibility of a Secret SossIob ofthe House of Comraona to consider the state of the Nation 1border to enable the Oovwrameat to give the House confidentialinformation.  The) Chief mXp had expressed doubts whether theproceedings could, is fact, be kept secret sad had suggestedas sa alternative that the Government might receive certaininfluential member, of the House of Coaraoas, including theLeader of the Labour Opposition.   The discussion turnedlargely ob the probably attitude of Mr. Churchill (who was amember of the Air Defence Research Committee - Sir AustenChamberlain having refused to become a member).    Mr. Churchillhad bees &quot;very intransigent&quot; ob the Committee aad was seekingaad opportunity to attack the Government&apos;s defence policy andpot forward plans of his own.   The Cabinet eventually agreedthat Sir Austen Chamberlain Should be told that the Governmentwould not refuse to meet representatives of all Parties inboth Houses or to give them information if a meeting was to hearranged with a view to forming a united front;   sad thatSir Anstsa Chamberlain should be encouraged to approach theLeader of the Labour Opposition 1b the first instance toascertain whether he would he willing to Join la aa approach tothe cabinet on this understanding.

Onthe flret occasion the Prime Minister replied that while hedid not accept the implicatioa that there waa nationaldisunity, &quot;as regards consultation with the Leaders of otherParties I should haws bo hesitation in asking the Leader ofthe Opposition or the right bob.

Memorial services are ordinarily arranged by Interestedorganisations in consultation with the relatives and theChurch authorities, sad the Cabinet Office have no responsibilsyfor Initiating action.Oa the death of a Minister in office a awjaorial service,If the relatives agreed, would normally be arranged by hisDepartment (examples   a memorial service for Mies iOleaWilkinson in February, 1947, eas organised by the Ministry of donation.)    Departments have, however, no responsibilityfor organising memorial services for their former Ministers!this waa made el ear by the Cabinet in October, 19h9(CM.62(1*9)3) when the question waa raised whether theBerne Office should take the initiative in arranging a memorialaarvice far Mr. J.R. Clynea, a former Home Secretary.(In July, 1948, the Scottish Office took the Initiative laarranging n service for Mr. J.

Exceptionally, isNovember, 1947, the Foreign Office were responsible for thememorial service for Mr. John winant, Halted statesAwhessador la London during the Second World war;   and thecommonwealth Relations Office have sometimes taken the leadwhen Coiam*awealth interests have predominated.Special arrangements have been made,, by 10, Downing Street(in consultation with the relatives) on the death of formerPrime Ministers (Mr. Ramsay MacDaaald, 1b 1937; Mr. Chamberlainin 1940;   Sari Lloyd George in 1945;  Lord Baldwin in 1947).la 1944 the ilar Cabinet Office undertook the organisationof the memorial service for Lord Moyee, Minister Resident inthe Middle seat.   The reason for this was that the MinisterResident reported la the was?

Gala Performance. Coveat Garden. 9to March. 1950A Gala Ballet Performance, attended by the Sing and members ofthe Royal Family, was held at Covent Garden in honour of the FrenchPresident and his wife during their visit to London of 7th - 10th March.The Lord Chamberlain&apos;s Office asked No. 10, Downing Street, to help withseating arrangements in the Ministerial Box at this performance and No.10 in turn brought in the Cabinet Office.    The Lord Chamberlain1s Officeissued invitations to all Ministers of Cabinet rank; and to the LawOfficers, also to the Opposition Leaders in both Houses and to theSpeaker.     In consultation with No. 10, Downing Street, the CabinetOffice drew up a seating plan.    As Royalty was not represented in theBox, it was not thought necessary to adhere to the strict order ofprecedence given in Whitaker&apos;s Almanack, which would have been unfamiliarand puzzling to the Ministers, but to follow Cabinet precedence, withthe following modifications;-(i)   The Lord Chancellor and his lady were given the two seatsnext the Royal Box:   they thus sat above the Prime Ministerand his wife, but as there were only four seats in thisblock the order of the two couples was not obvious.(ii)   The Leaders of the Opposition sat next below the LordPresident.(iii)   The Lord Privy Seal sat next to the Opposition Leaders.(The Speaker had declined the invitation to attend.)At the request of the Lord Chamberlain&apos;s Office five ushers wereprovided to show Ministers w tneir seats, two from No. 10, two from theCabinet Office and one from the Ministry of Defence.     Each of these wasprovided wita a plan of the seating arrangements;   cards printed withMinisters&apos; names were placed on the seats before the performance.    Thesecards were prepared by the Foreign Office printer at the request of theCabinet Office.A feature of this occasion was that Ministers were unable toreach the theatre until just before the interval, because there was animportant division in the House of Commons half-an-hour after toeperformance was due to begin, and as the Government of the day had only avery narrow majority they could not afford to do without so many votes.Ministers&apos; wives ana Ministers in the Lords with their wives arrived atthe proper time and Ministers in the Commons, including the Prime Minister,joined them after the division.

CABINET paOCaOJRBDevelopment of &quot;Mqtes 09 Procedure&quot;1.     GeneralThe arrangements made by the Cabinet for the conductof its business and ths handling of its documents arematters for the Cabinet itself.     Nevertheless there hasbeen since 1919 a very large measure of uniformity!   andonce ths existence of the Secretariat was confirmed thebasic instructions given to the Secretary of the Cabinetby successive administrations have been very largely thesame.     At the same time the tendency has been tointroduce a greater degree of systematisation andincreasingly to build up a corpus of notes on a widevariety of procedural points of concern to Ministers.This note traces in broad outline the development of thepractice of issuing general notes on procedure of thiskind.     It does not attempt to list changes in Cabinetprocedure as such, on which reference should be made tothe appropriate entry in the Precedent Book.2.     The Cabinet. 1919 - .V?&amp;The brief instructions to the Secretary approved atthe first meeting of Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s CoalitionCabinet on 4th November, 1919 (Cab.1(19)3) set thepattern for all subsequent instructions.     They dealt,in few sentences, with the form and circulation ofCabinet Minutes, the circulation of Cabinet papersand secretarial arrangements for committees andconferences.    These simple instructions   bad theirfoundation in the practice adopted by the War Cabinetof 1916-1919*     The draft was approved subject to a numberof amendments, the most important being the deletion ofinstructions regarding the recovery of Cabinet documentsfrom Ministers leaving office.     The Cabinet consideredthat secrecy was &quot;safeguarded by the rule that no onewas entitled to make public uss of Cabinet documentswithout the permission of the King&quot;.    &amp;nnex A).3.    On successive changes of Government it was the practicefor the Secretary to circulate to the Cabinet a copy of theinstructions he had received from the previous Governmentand to ask what procedure he was to adopt.     In the earlyif ears after 1919 this submission was accompanied bya memorandum describing the work of the Cabinet Secretariatand sometimes by notes on the work of   Cabinet Committeesunder the previous administration.     For the most partthe new Cabinet has been content to adopt the procedureof its predecessor (sometimes with minor variations)and once Cabinet approval was obtained the new instructionswere circulated for general guidance, usually in the formof an annex to the Cabinet Conclusions.km     The instxuotions approved by Mr. Bonar Law&apos;a Cabinetin November, 1922 (Cab.64(22)2) were somewhat fuller thanthose adopted in 1919 and their wording has very largelyre-appeared in all subsequent notes (Annex B).     Somerefinements were later introduced in the instructions onCabinet procedure, but the wording of the instructionsas regards Cabinet Committees and conferences remainedpractically unaltered   until the period of the War Cabinet.
0 5.     Thff First Lab^ Cabins^, ^2jtCab/A/l3 At their first meeting on 23rd January, 1924 (Cab.7(24)1)Cab/0/20       the Labour Cabinet accepted the principle of a Cabinetj* Secretary and agreed that the earlier instructions should beW followed for the time being, although they asked theSecretary, in minuting their proeedings, to reeord theirconclusions only \vith necessary explanatory notes. *    Thefirst major change in procedure resulted from discussionsat Cabinet in April, 1924 (Cab.25(24)6) when dissatisfaction wasexpressed with the existing arrangements for the submissionof business and for the scrutiny of Bills beforeintroduction in Parliament.     The matter was furtherdiscussed on 15th April, 1924 (Cab.27(i*4)4) in the light ofa report by the Secretary of the Cabinet and instructionswere given for the issue of a Treasury circular laying downthe procedure for the submission of business.     In futurememoranda and draft Bills were to be submitted to theCabinet only after their subject-matter had been fullyexamined between the Departments Concerned, the Treasuryand the Law Officers if contentious Bills were involved.   Itwas also laid down that no papers for decision would beincluded on the agenda until at least five days after theircirculation.    (Treasury Circular of 28th April, 1924, seeAnnex C, Appendix I.)6.    The Cabinet 1924-1931The existing instructions to the Secretary were adoptedby Mr. Baldwin1s Cabinet on 12th November, 1924(Cab.59(24)1);   the arrangements made by the LabourGovernment for the submission of business were likewisere-affirmed, and the Treasury circular reissued.Cab./A/27 The secretary *s instructions were now well establishedand were adopted without change by the Second Labour Cabinetin June, 1929 (Cab.23(29)3) * and by Mr. Maedonald^ twoNational Cabinets (Cab.54(31)8 and 75(31)3.     On25th February, 1931 a further Treasury circular was issued15/34/1       covering the original circular of April 1924 and thesecirculars reappeared with all later versions of the instructions.Since 1931 procedural notes of this kind have been issued onthe authority of the Prime Minister and have not beenformally submitted to the Cabinet for approval.7.     The Cabinet. 1932-19*1The instructions in the form in which they were circulatedin 1931 (C.P.205(31)) remained current until April, 1936,when they were printed with one or two minor changes(CP.88(36) and issued with notes on the procedure of the4/I/6        Committee of Imperial Defence and on the Economic AdvisoryCouncil.    Copies of the notes wera sent to new Ministers onappointmentThroughout the period from 1919 to 1939 the circulatednotes were entirely confined to matters of Cabinet and CabinetCommittee procedure.    Guidance to Ministers on particularquestions (e. g. speeches) was for the atost part embodied in*0 the Cabinet Conclusions;   only rarely were matters of this,kind dealt with in circulated nutes or memoranda.
k4/l/6A (Pt. 2)&apos;t. 1)8.    The wax cabinet, 1939-45,On 5th September, 1939 the secretary of the ,VarCabinet circulated a note (.*.r. (0) (3y)l) on changes in theorganisation and procedure of the Cabinet Offlee asa result of the Instruction of the War Cabinet.     Thisdealt, among other things, with attendance at the WarCabinet and the submission of business.     Printed&apos;Hote8 on war Cabinet Procedure1 were first Issued in-arch, 1942.     These covered the preparation of theAgenda, attendance, form and circulation of theConclusions, action on the Conclusions, and the form,reproduction and circulation of memoranda.     A revisedversion issued in May, 1943 included a new section onthe submission of business (Annex  &quot; ).     These notesembodied, where appropriate, the pre-war instructions to theSecretary&apos;, but their content was largely new and theyhave been used as the basis of all subsequent notesof the kind.During this period other points of procedure(e.g. precautions against the disclosure of information,position of Parliamentary Private Secretaries,Ministerial speeches and broadcasts) were usually dealt within circular minutes from the Prime minister to all Ministers.9.    Mr. Attlee&apos;s Labour Cabinet. 1945Mo general notes on procedure were issued underMr. Churchill1 s &apos;Caretaker&apos; administration of   ay-July,1945.In August, 1945 the Prime Minister approved theissue of two sets of procedural notes.     Thefirst set (C.p.(45)99) reproduced with necessarychanges the notes on .*ar Cabinet procedure of ^ay, 1943*The second (OP.&amp;5)1G0 brought together everything ofpermanent value in the miscellaneous procedural notescirculated during the war.These notes were followed in December, 1945 bya general directive on Cabinet and Committee procedure(C.P.(45)306), outlining the principles to be followedin the presentation of business to the Cabinet and itsCommittees.A consolidated version of C.P.(45)99, 100 and 306(embodying points made in several other proceduralnotes which had since been issued) was circulated bythe Prime Minister in May, 1946 (CP. (46)199).In CP. (46)357 the   Prime Minister drew attentionto points which should be kept in mind in the work ofU/1/6A (Pt. 3)  Cabinet Committees.   A further general note onCabinet business and procedure (CP. (47)288) wascirculated after the reconstruction of the Cabinet inOctober, 1947.4/1/6A (Pt. 2)In April. 1949 a new consolidated statement(CP. (1.9)95) was circulated.     This covered the maintopics included in CP. (1*6)199 and embodied also thesubstance of various other directives which had sincebeen issued by the Prime Minister on procedural mattera.
