On the appointment of Cabinet CommitteesIn the period before December, 1916, seenotes in File 4/l/m.On the war Council, the DardanellesCommittee and the War Committee In the FirstWorld War, see Glbba, 3ar Cabinet narrative.On the Committee of Imperial Defence (whichhas been described as a Prime Minister&apos;sCommittee as distinct from a Cabinet Committee),see lectures by Sir K. Haakey (1927) and GeneralIsmay (1939)   (Copies In eart VII (5) - Annex V)and Glbbs, War Cabinet Narrative.On Cabinet Committees in the period up to1939 see Jennings, pp. 198-202;   Anson, Vol. 11(1)p. 133;   Gibbs, War Cabinet Narrative:   note ofJune, 1936 in Part VII(5) - Annex V (Home AffaiisCommittee)!   Note of April, 1936 in Part VII(4)(Economic Advisory Council, etc.)Cabinet Committees fulfil two functions: -(a) The mass of business engaging the collectiveresponsibility of the Government is too great to be handledby a single body.      Cabinet Committees relieve the burdenfalling on &quot;the Cabinet in two ways.     First, they disposefina ly of a great number of problems of minor importance,acting in the Cabinet&apos;s name by virtue of powers delegatedto them by the Cabinet.      Secondly, on problems which areof such importance that they must in any event come tothe Cabinet, a Committee can shorten discussion in Cabinetby preliminary examination which focusses the issues andnarrows down the points outstanding for the Cabinet&apos;adecision.      This often enables the Chairman of a Committeeto put to the Cabinet in a single memorandum issues whichwould otherwise come before them in separate paperssubmitted by several Ministers.(b) The system of Cabinet Committees enables Ministersof Cabinet rank who are not members of the Cabinet to taketheir share in the formulation of Government pol cy.     Bytheir membership of these Committees, they can assist indisposing of business devolved by the Cabinet to theCommittees, and can also join in the preliminary stages offormulating polioy proposals for submission to theCabinet.The Cabinet Committee system not only relieves thepressure on the Cabin t itself but also lightens thecollective work of Ministers generally.     None of theCabinet Committees is as large as the Cabinet itself.Some of the more important Committees may consist of tenMinisters, as compared with 17 members of the Cabinet.Other Committees are substantially smaller.

The Coalition Government&apos;s Machinery ofGovernment Committee gave much study to thelines on which a permanent Cabinet Committeeorganisation should be developed.       See    . ^ YM.G.(43) 2 (Second Revise)   (Copy in Part YII(6) -Annex V).See also references noted In para. 1 above.*i- Cabinet Committees are of two kinds * StandingCommittees and Ad Hoc Committees.     The ad hoc Committeesare set up by the Cabin t or by the Prime Minister tohandle   questions of transient importance* often to workout the details of a policy which the Cabinet has approvedin principle, or to find means of surmounting difficult eswhich have bean raised In a Cabinet discussion but neednot detain the Cabinet as a whole.      On this account theyare usually smaller than the Standing Committees of theCabinet.     They normally meet two or three times and thensubmit a report to the Cabinet.     They may, however,remain in being for several months if they have beenappointed to handle problems which, though temporary, mayglre ride to difficulties over a period.3 The Standing Committees of the Cabinet are arrangedon a more schematic basis.     They are designed to provlea regular means of handling, below the Cabinet level,problems engaging the collective responsibility ofMinisters which arise regularly throughout the year,whenever there is a reasonable bulk of homogeneous questionswhich can with advantage be discussed below the level ofthe Cabinet itself, it is the practice to establish aStanding Committee to deal with them.      The growth of theCabinet Committee system is, ho ever, very largely anempirical growth - Committees are established whenexperience has shown the need for them and abolished whenthey are no longer required.     There is no consciousIntention to Impose a logical system which would providean appropriate Committee for every problem.which mightconceivably arise.     Many proposals are in fact submittedto the Cabinet direct, especially if they are of suchImportance that they must be considered by the Cabinetitself but not of such complexity that they must firstbe &quot;pre-digested&quot; by a Committee.
Ministry of D*f*nnn flnnunltt.f ab* *        The Coiiiiilttees working under the Minister of Defenceand served by a secretariat In the Ministry of Defenceare, strictly speaking, not Cabinet Committees.     ouch ofthese Committees as consist of Ministers (e.g. the DefenceProduction Committee, the Standing Committee of ServiceMinisters) are, however, comparable to Cabinet Committeesand their procedure and organisation are similar.The Committees which worked under theMinister of Reconstruction In 19U3-4U werein a somewhat similar position.The secretary of the Cabinet has a special responsibilityfor advising the Prime Minister on all questions connectedwith the appointment and organisation of Cabinet Cowtoitteee,for making suggestions on the composition of new Comuitteesand for maintaining a constant watoh over the wording of thesystem generally.
Cabinet Committees are appointed by the Prime Ministeron behalf of the Cabinet, from whom, directly or Indirectly,their authority is derived.     The origin of a CabinetCommittee frequently lies in a decision of the Cabinet:if the Cabinet find difficulty in reaching a decision onsons difficult problem it is sometimes found convenient toappoint a Committee to go over the ground in detail and toaake recommendations.    Again, the Prise Minister maydecide (on a submission from the Secretary of the Cabinetor otherwise) that a Committee should be set up to   takegeneral charge, under the direction of the Cabinet, ofdevelopment of policy in a particular field.The appointment of a new Committee is notified to allconcerned by the issue of a memorandum setting out:-(a) The authority for the appointment (this may be areference to a Cabinet Conclusion, a decision bythe Prime Minister or. in the ease of Sub-Committees,a Committees minutes.;(b) The terms of reference of the Committee,(e)   The names of the Chairman and Members.(d) The names of the Secretary or Secretaries.(e) Any necessary remarks about the method of workof the Committee or its relations with otherCommittees.In the case of Ministerial Committees,and the more important Official Committees,this memorandum is prepared and signedcfr by the Secretary ** the Cabinet and, afterapproval by the Prime Minister, is circulatedas a Cabinet paper.     In the case of Bub-Committees,it is prepared by the Secretary of the parentCommittee in consultation with the Secretaryof the Cabinet, and circulated as a paperof the parent Committee.     In either case it isalso circulated as the first paper of thenew Committee.     If the Committee or Sub-Committee is appointed ad hoc   for a strictlylimited purpose, and is likely to complete itstask in a very short time, the first stagsof circulation in the Cabinet or parentCommittee series is dispensed with, and thenotification is circulated only   as the firstpaper of the new Committee.For procedure on the start of a newseries of documents see PartlY^ j
-n, *JJPosa of a Committee, and the seops of itsand authority, are expressed in ita Teras of reference.Oeandttees whether Standing or ad hoo Committees, maybe empowered by their Terms of Reference to decide Questionsltelr S!n authox,it** w be limited to making recommendationsmL -2 -nSi??t 0r ,TJher Go^&quot;ee;   m any oLe the Cabinetmay at any time call for a report from a Committee and anyMinister may appeal to the Cabinet against a Committee*mdecision.Prior to the Second World War the minute,of the Home Policy Committee were regularlysubmitted to the Cabinet for confirmation.
y        Chairmen of Ministerial Committees are appointed directlyby the Prime Minister;   chairmen of Official Committees areappointed by his authority, which may be given in leasimportant oases by the secretary of the Cabinet on his behalf*The Prime Minister himself is usually chairman of the mostimportant Cabinet Committees;   and he is entitled to takethe chair of any Cabinet Committee at any time withoutaltering its constitution.     The chairs of severalimportant C omit tees are held b. Ministers with co-ordinatingfunctions, e.g. the Lord President of the Couonil and theChancellor of the exchequer.     It is normally desirable toavoid a situation where the Chairman of a MinisterialCommittee is junior to one or more of the members.     ThePrime Minister may himself decide the chairmanship ofMinisterial Committees, but it is open to the secretary ofthe Cabinet to make suggestions to him (after such consultationas may be desirable).     Unless the circumstances (e.g. previousdiscussions in Cabinet) make this unnecessary, the PrimeMinister normally himself asks the Minister concerned toaccept the Chairmanship, either by minute or personally.     Inless important cases the Secretary of the   Cabinet maydo this on his behalf.Although senior, the Minister of Defencesits under the Home Secretary*s Chairmanshipat meetings of the Ministerial Committee onCivil Defenoe.     See Pile 7/2/U4.On occasion it has happened that a Ministerwho while In office had been Chairman of aCommittee of Imperial Defence sub-Committeecontinued to be Chairman after he left office.Thus ^ord Haldane continued as Chairman of aCommittee on Anti-Aircraft Research (A.R.C. 1st -14th Me. ting, May, 1925 - March, 1^28);   andLord Cecil as Chairman of a number of otherSub-Committees,     Both attended the meetingsof the Committee of Imperial Defence at whichthe reports of their sub-Committees were consideredSee Part VII(l)(B).t0 The chairmanship of Official Committees is usually settledby the secretary of the Cabinet in consultation with theheads of the Departments mainly concerned with the subjectmatter of the Committee.     This consultation may occasionallybe carried out by letter, but usually takes place ininter-Departmental discussion when the scope and functions ofthe Committee to be set up are settled.     In important oasesthe *-rime Minister is informed of the proposed chairmanin the submission by the secretary of the Cabinet seeking hisapproval generally to the setting up of the Committee.     Toavoid delay the chairman&apos;s name is sometimes alone given inthe main paper announcing the appointment of the Committee,the membership for that purpose being expressed as consistingof representatives of specified Departments.It is sometimes found convenient toarrange for a Junior Minister to take thechair at meetings of Official Committees.Examples   re the Middle iSast (Official)Committee before its reoonstitution inApril, 1949 (Pile 7/2/30);   the MaterialsCommittee (File 7/2/46);   the South-Bast Asia(Food ouppliee) Committee before itsreeonstitutlon in 1946 (File 7/2/50)i theAfrica Coiu. ittee, (File 7/4/28).
11.        Deputy chairmen are nominated only in special circumstances.If the Chairman is unavoidably absent from a meeting, the Chair istaken by the senior Minister present.The Minister of Defence is Deputy Chairmanof the Defence Committee.     See Cmd. 6925.Deputy Chairmen have also been appointed forcertain Official Committees.When the membership of certain Cabinet Committeeswas being revised after the reconstruction ofMr. Attiee&apos;s Administration in March, 1950* it wasrepresented that the Lord Chancellor&apos;s specialposition on the Legislation Committee, where he saton the right of the Lord President (the Chairman),entitled him to higher precedence on the Front Pageof the minutes than he would have received if theorder given in the list of Minitters was strictlyadhered to.     It was therefore suggested to thePrime Minister, with the agreement of the LordPresident, that the Lord Chancellor should beformally appointed Deputy Chairman, and the PrimeMinister agreed to this.
According to their membership, Committees are eitherMinisterial, i.e composed entirely or mainly of Ministers,or Official, composed entirely or mainly of officials,sometimes Official Committees, and more rarely MinisterialCommittees, have members from outside Government servicealtogether;   usually, however, when such persons attendmeetings of Cabinet Committees they do so to give evidenceor advice and not as members.A recent example of a mixed Committee isthe Food Distribution Committee appointedin May, 1948 under the chairmanship of theEconomic secretary, Treasury,     Itsmembe ship consisted of Junior Ministers andofficials.     See Pile 7/2/103.Prom time to time Opposition representativesand others were Invited to attend meetingsof the Committee of Imperial Defence aid Insome cases they were members of itsSub-Committee.     In 1913 ^ord Balfour andLord 3sher were members of a standingCommittee of the Committee of ImperialDefence on oversea attack on the UnitedKingdom.     In 1914-15 Lord Balfour was amember of the War Council.     In 1935-37Mr. Churchill was a member of the oub-Committee on Air Defence Research (A.K.D.4tb-12th Meetings).     See note in Part VII(1)(B)and File 27/10/18.On 11th May, 1931 the Prime Minister(Mr. Macdonald) stated in reply to a  uestionin the House of Commons! &quot;In aooordance witha precedent followed on several previousoccasions His Majesty&apos;s Government haveinvited the other parties to be representedon the bub-Committee of the Committee ofImperial Defence which is engaged on theconsideration of problems connected with theforthcoming Disarmament Conference.     Theultimate responsibility tor the policydecided on will, of course, rest with HisMajesty*s Government&quot;.    (Hansard, Col. 805)./3In the appointment of a Ministerial Committee it iscustomary for the Secretary of the Cabinet, on the PrimeMinister&apos;s behalf, to send minutes to the Ministers concerned,informing them of the Prime Minister&apos;s decision to appoint theCommittee and of his wish that they should serve upon it.These minutes are as a rule couched in terms which do not callfor a reply, but it is usual to allow a short Interval aftertheir despatch before a note is circulated formally settingup the Committee.     In certain c iroumstanoea (e.g. where itis clear to all concerned that a particular Minister mustobviously be a member of the new Committee) these minutesare dispensed with.     In other circumstances they may besent by the Prims Minister himself, particularly if theMinister is being asked to serve not so much in a Departmentalas in a personal capacity.For examples of minutes sent personallyby the Prims Minister, see File 7/2/73.(Fuel Committee;   minute to the Lord President,who had been absent through illness when theCommittee was set up).In March, 1948, the Prims Minister sentKreonal letters in manuscript to the Minister offence and the Minister of Lealth inviting themto became members of the -Economic t-oxicy Committee!*ee File 7/2/82.
The factors to be borne in mind in considering theMembership of a new Ministerial Committee cannot beprecisely defined.     Obviously those Ministers whoseDepartments are primarily concernec with the subject matter .w*.ll normally be members of the Committee.     In determiningthe remaining membership, personal and political footers areimportant;   it is important also to see that individualMinisters are not excessively burdened with Committee work.In   ay, 1948, when it was proposed thatMr. Dalton, who had then Ju. t been appointedChancellor of the Duoy of Lancaster, shouldbe a member of the Defence Committee, theMinister of Defence (who had not been consultedby the Prime Minister) held that as themembership of the Committee was laid down inCmd. 6923 s change in membership, ifacceptable on other grounds, would need tobe oomaunioated to 1 arllament.     This viewwas contested, but the Prime Minister decidedin any event to withdraw the authorityhe had previously given for Mr. Dal ton&apos;sappointment.     See Pile 7/2/3.The membership of Official Committees is usuallysettled by the secretary of the Cabinet in consultation withthe heads of the Departments concerned.     The normal methodis for the oecr. tary of the Cabinet to write to themoutlining the functions of the Committee and asking them tonominate representatives.     This is sometimes done afterthe circulation of the paper announcing the setting up ofthe Committee.
H      Secretaries of all Cabinet Committees, whether Ministerialor Official, are appointed by toe Secretary of the Cabinet;they are normally members of the Cabinet Office or the Officeof the Lord President of the Council; where, however, aparticular Department is closely concerned with the work of aCommittee, a Joint or Assistant Secretary from that Departmentmay be appointed by agreement between the Head of theDepartment and the Secretary of the Cabinet.     Occasionally,Official Committees are served only by DepartmentalSecretaries;   this is, however, exceptional, and often leadsto doubt as to the status of the Committee as a CabinetCommittee.The Secretary is the servant of the Committee as a whole,but particularly of the Chairman, to whom he looks forinstructions on any questions which may arise and under whoseauthority he acts on matters on which he had not been givenprecise instructions by the Committee itself.     On generalquestions of the practice and procedure of Cabinet Committees,however, he is responsible to the Secretary of the Cabinet,through his superior officer in the Cabinet Of flee, if he has one.In addition to his vork in direct connection with meetings,the Secretary of a Committee is responsible for doing all heean to assist the Committee in fulfilling its function, by(a) drawing the attention of the Chairman to events or informationwhich affect the Committee*s work, (b) watching the action takenby Departments to implement the Committee*s conclusions,particularly where the Committee has called for a return orreport, and (c) preparing, as part of the permanent record ofthe Committee*s activities, cm index of the matters dealt withand decisions taken.Normally the member of the Cabinet Office who is to actas Secretary of a new Committee is informed at the time whenthe memorandum announcing the appointment of the Committee isunder preparation in the Private Office.     Arrangementsare normally made at the same time for the nomination of aCommittee Clerk to assist the Secretary with clerical workfor the Committee.     Notes of guidance for CommitteeSecretaries a.e circulated by the Secretary of the Cabinetfrom time to time.Occasionally the Cabinet Office is asked toprovide a Seer tar. to make a record of adhocmeetings of Ministers held at 10, Downing Street.They have also in the past provided theSecretariat for various Committees of enquirywhi h are not strictly Cabinet Committees, e.g.the Committee of Enquiry into the procedure forordering Civil Aircraft (19*4-8);   Committee onIntermediaries (1949)* (Other similar Committeesare the Committee on Basic English (19U6) andthe Committee on the Regent&apos;a Park Terraces
19A. Cabinet Committees normally meet in Conference Booms in theCabinet Office, except that meetings of which the Prime Minister isChairman normally meet at No. 10, Downing Street.     The business of theHouse sometimes demands that meetings should be held in the Houses   onthese occasions the Prime Minister&apos;s room or the room of another Ministeris normally used.After the General  Lection of February, 1950,Mr. At ties&apos;s Labour Government were returned to power with avery small majority in the House of Commons.    Mr. Attleetherefore gave instructions that Ministers must regardregular and continuous attendance at the House of Commons astheir urgent duty and that meetings of Cabinet and CabinetCommittees must be held at the House during the tours whenthe House was sitting.    The Minister of Works, on his owninitiative, arranged for a Committee Room to be made availablefor the use of Ministers and it was suggested that this mightbe used for meetings of Cabinet Committees of which the PrimeMinister was not Chairman (the Prime Minister&apos;s own room beingused when he was in the Chair).     The suggestion was rejected,on the ground that the Committee corridor is in that part ofthe Palace of Westminster on which by tradition Governmentbusiness does not encroach and that Private Members could notbe prevented from looking into the room during meetings, e.g.in Bearch of a colleague.    The Foreign Secretary agreed thathis room in the House (the biggest, apart from the PrimeMinister&apos;s) might normally be used for meetings of Committeesof which toe Prime Minister was not Chairman.HA.
The procedure of Cabinet Committees approximates to thatof the Cabinet.     Matters for discussion are normally raisedby members only after giving notice, either by the submissionof a memorandum or, if they wish to raise a matter orally,by notifying the Secretary, so that the Chairman and othermembers may be informed.    The decision as to what may andwhat may not be discussed lies with the Chairman, and on thisit is the duty of the Secretary to advise him so far as he can.At meetings the procedure is informal, the discussion beingcontrolled by the Chairman but not subject to any rules ofdebate.    Cabinet Committees do not vote or pass resolutions:their Conclusions are the general sense of the meeting, as itemerges from the discussion, and as it is frequently summed upby the Chairman at the end of the meeting.     The Secretary isparticularly responsible for the recording of the conclusionsand is entitled to ask what they are if he is not sure.Otherwise he does not speak at meetings, except to answerquestions addressed to him about the carrying out of his duties.The current notes on procedure state:-While Committee meetings provide at times a useful forumfor the discussion of policy and for qnabling Ministers toensure that their points of view are understood and to make acontribution to the formulation of policy, their prime objectis the despatch of business and the making of decisions.     Inter-departmental questions should be settled as far as possiblebetween officials, or falling that between Ministers, of theDepartments directly concerned.     They should not be allowedto drag on.     Where colleagues have to be consulted, but onlytwo or three are directly concerned, agreement can often bereached by correspondence or by personal meetings;   much timecan be saved by personal contact.     Failing agreement recoursecan be had to the Prime Minister, Lord President or Chancellorof the Exchequer.     This will often make it unnecessary to takethe matter to a Committee.Particular points which the Prime Minister wishes theChairmen   of Committees to keep in ..And are:-(a) Care should be taken to prevent papers comingforward for discussion which could be settledotherwise;   and Secretaries of Committees shouldbe encouraged to submit suggestions for reducingthe amount of business to be transmitted at fullmeetings.(b) Attendance should be restricted to the permanentMembers and other Ministers who have a majorinterest in the question tinder discussion.Ministers should not be required to sit throughlengthy discussions in case points affectingtheir Departments should be raised;   nor shouldthey insist on attending meetings for the purposeof making Departmental points which have noimportant bearing on the main issues under discussion.Arrangements should be made for the attendance ofone of the Law Officers at meetings at which legalissues are lively to arise.
(c) Discussion should be kept to the point;   irrelevanceor repetition should be checked.(d) Conclusions should not be framed in a say whichwill require further discussion by Ministers, ifthat is not necessary.     Once a policy decisionhas been taken, responsibility for its detailedworking out and the supervision of its executioncan usually be left to the Ministers departmentallyconcerned.(e) The dilatory process of referring a question fromone Committee to another should be avoided as faras possible.(f) Much time is lost in the aggregate if meetings donot begin punctually at the appointed hour.(CP. (49)95, paragraphs 27-28).For-an earlier statement of the pointsincluded in paragraphs 27 and 28 of C.P. (49)95,Bee CP. (46)357 and CP. (47) 258.The standing rules regarding prior discussion with theTreasury on proposals involving expenditure or affectinggeneral financial or economic policy apply equally tosubmissions to Ministerial Committees as to the Cabinet, aslikewise the rule which requires that proposals involvingadditional staff must be accompanied by an estimate of theadditional man-power likely to be needed.     See CP. (49) 95*paragraph 4.
Subject to the concurrence of the Chairman, any Ministerhas a right to attend meetings of a Ministerial Committee ofwhich he is not a member for the discussion of matters forwhich he ie responsible.     Similarly any Department has aright to be represented at meetings of Official Committees.If a Minister who is a member of a Committee or who has beeninvited for a particular item is unable for any reasonto attend it is usual for him to be represented by hisParliamentarv Secretary.   (It is exceptional for a Ministerto be represented by an official.)   The regular representationof a Minister by his Parliaments Secretary is, however,to be avoided as derogating from the importance of theCommittee;   and steps are taken from time to time to reminddefaulters of their responsibilities.Where Ministers must unavoidably be absent from meetingsit is customary for the chairman to be informed in advance,either by the Minister himself (by letter, or minute, orthrough his Private Secretary) or by the Secretary of theCommittee.    In the case of Committees of which the PrimeMinister is himself chairman his approval must be obtainedto the attendance of a representative.     This is usuallydone by minute, from the Secretary of the Committee, or, Iftime does not allow, orally through the Private Secretaries.If a Minister Is himself unable to be present it issometimes unnecessary for him to be represented unless hisDepartment is substantially concerned in the business to betaken.    In these circumstances the Minister may pat his viewin writing to the Chairman or through some other member ofthe Committee.     Particular isolated points are sometimescommunicated to the Secretary, who takes steps to inform theChairman.While the attendance of officials at meetings of theCabinet is very rare, their attendance at meetings ofMinisterial Committees is more frequent but neverthelessexceptional, certainly at the more important Committees,including those of which the Prime Minister is chairman.The attitude of chairmen to the attendance of officialsvaries, but save in exceptional circumstances, it shouldbe discouraged.     If an official is to attend the Chairmanshould be informed in advance, and in the ease of Committeesosrer which the Prime Minister presides his specific approvalmost be obtained.    Officials attending Ministerial meetingsdo not normally speak;   they may, however, in rare cases, beasked to explain some point in discussion at the request of theChairman or of their own Minister.     Any such statementsare not normally attributed to them personally in the minutesof the meeting.Representatives of Departments attending meetings ofOfficial Committees are normally held to be expressing nottheir personal views but the official views of their Depart-ments.    In special circumstances (e.g. when there has beeninsufficient time for prior consultation) they may state thatthe views expressed are personal and may reserve theirDepartments position.It is a standing instruction to Secretaries of Committeesthat they should take steps to see that Government spokesmenin the House of Lords are invited to meetings of CabinetCommittees when matters of particular concern to them are
to be discussed, e.g. draft Bills for which they will beft responsible la the House of Lords.     See note by thesecretary of the Cabinet of 13th December, 1947 (recirculatedr 2nd November, 1943):   Pile 7/2/85.In February, 1946 consideration was givento the circulation of a note stressing theimportance of the personal attendance ofMinisters who were ueaibers of Cabinet Committees.The proposal was, however, not pursued, andinstead action was taken through the PrivateSecretaries of particular Ministers.     Similaraction has since been taken from time to timeparticularly in respect of attendance atmeetings of the Lord President*s Committee,see File 4/1/31.Since the Secretary of state for Scotlandhas frequently to be in Scotland on Fridays itwas arranged in 1947 that where necessary, hemight be represented by one of the JointParliamentary Under-Secretaries of State atmeetings of the Lord President&apos;s Committee andthe Production Committee.     See paragraph 3 ofa note by the Secretary of the Cabinet dated16th October, 1947 on the times of meetings ofthe r.iain standing committees of the Cabinet.(File 48 Pt. 2).A similar dispensation has been given tothe Chancellor of the   xchequer, who may fromtime to time be represented by the FinancialSecretary or the Economic Secretary.In present circumstances it is very rare for persons whoare not Ministers of the Crown or Crown Servants to attendmeetings of Ministerial Committees.     On rare occasions suchpersons have b. n present at meetings of Official Comalttees.In the past such attendance at meetingsof the Committee of Imperial   Defence and itsSub-Committee was not unknown.     On 28th May, 1906Lord Balfour, then Leader of the Opposition,attended to give evidence before the Sub-Commitof the Committee of Imperial Defence on thequestion of oversea attack on the United Kingdom.(For this purpose he had been sent a copy ofthe Sub-Committee *s draft report and of earlierpapers.)   On 10th March, 1915, Mr. Bonar Law(Leader of the Opposition) and Lord Lansdowneattended a meeting of the War Council.     In1930, Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Lloyd George wereinvited to a meeting of the Committee ofImperial Defence to discuss the question of aChannel tunnel.     In 1931, prior to theDisarmament Conference, several Oppositionleaders were called into conference by theCommittee of Imperial Defence, includingSir Austen Chauberlaln, Sir Samuel Koare,Sir Thomas Ins kip, Mr. Lloyd George, SirHerbert Samuel, Mr.  den, L rd Cecil andLord Lothian.     There is no record ofOpposition leaders attending after 1931*     Seealso above, M^tBffiT^HIPr FUnS 7/a/hOf.ft
19/10/121&apos;  Will  Jemimas, Anoso.for attendance at meetings of theFmergency Business Committee see note of1st January, 19*49 on File 27/V12.It has never been the practice, sincethe foundation of the Committee of ImperialDefence in 1904*, to pay foes for anyonenot a Government servant for attendance atany Cabinet Committee mooting.   Re-dmburssmestof travelling expenses and the payment ofsubsistence allowances was. however, providedfor in the ease of the Advisory Committee onAtomic Energy (File 7/3/14),and the Committeeon the Work of Psychologists and Psyehlstristsla the Services (File 7/4/29).   Certain of theWhwrii of the Advisory Panel for theOfficial Military Histories of too War receivehonoraria (File 71/1).
Adjustments in the Cabinet Committee system are oftenoccasioned by particular developments of policy.    The systemas a whole is, however, kept under general review by theSecretary of the Cabinet on behalf of the Prime Minister.Par-reaching adjustments are often made as a consequenceof Ministerial changes.    (Minor modifications are sometimesmade, with the Prime Minister&apos;s approval, when a fresh editionof the Com aittee Organisation Book is in preparation.)Broadly the system at any given time reflects on the onehand the pre-occupations in the field of policy and on theother the personal requirements and qualities of individualMinisters.From the nature of the case there is no prescribedprocedure to be followed.     normally when any general reviewof Cabinet Committees is contemplated the initiative istaken by the Prime Minister in discussing his tentativeproposals with his senior colleagues.     The Secretary of theCabinet may also be given an opportunity of co. rentingat a fairly early stage.     Sometimes discussion proceeds onthe basis of a draft memorandum (to be circulated ultimatelyto the Cabinet by the Prims Minister) prepared by theSecretary of the Cabinet on the Prime Minister*s instructions.When agreement has been reached the Prime Minister circulatesa general memorandum on the scope of the new Committeesand on their inter-relation; detailed notes on the compositionand terms of reference are circulated by the Secretary of theCabinet in the separate Committee series.At the end of 1945 a special review ofCabinet Committees and of the Committee workof Ministers was carried oat.   See File 7/2/3A.This review led to the issue of a directiveby the Prime Minister (CP. (45)306) on thepresentation of business to the Cabinet and itsCommittees and of a memorandum by the PrimeMinister (CP. (45)333) on the StandingMinisterial Committees of the Cabinet.A substantial change in the CabinetCommittee structure was carried out by thePrims Minister on the reconstruction ofthe Government in the autumn of 1947*     SeeCP. (47)280 and File 7/2/3 Pt. 6.
3cOne of the first steps after the formation of a neeCabinet is the appointment of new Cabinet Committees,including a King&apos;s Speech Committee.     Normally the mainstanding commltteee (e.g. the Lord President*s Committee andthe Legislation Committee) are reappointed;   it is thepractice for the Secretary of the Cabinet to draw attentionto the desirability of reappolnting these Committees, mostof which have been appointed by successive administrationsin one form or another.     Sometimes different titles areused, but it may be noted that the Legislation Committeehas retained the one series of symbols(H.P.C.) onreappointment by succeeding Cabinets.Por the procedure followed when the&quot;Caretaker&quot; G vernment succeeded the CoalitionGovernment in May, 1945, see Pile 7/2/3 Pt. 3*Por the appointment of Committees whenthe present Labour Government took officesee Pile 7/2/3 Pt- U.Por the practice in the numbering ofdocuments on the reappointment of standingcommittees see Part 17^Por the appointment of the King&apos;s SpeechCommittee after a change of Government see.notes of August, 1949 on Pile 27/6A.
Toe current notes on procedure statej-While the collective responsibility of Ministers oftencalls for discussion between Ministers on seme importantquestion which falls wholly or mainly within the purviewof a single Department, the normal course is for theresulting decision to be announced and defended by theMinister concerned as his own decision.There may be rare occasions when it is desirable toemphasise the importance of some decision by statingspecifically that it is the decision of His MajestyTs Government.This, however, should be the exception rather than the rule.The growth of any general practice whereby decisions of theCabinet were announced as such would lead to embarrassment.Thus, some decisions of Government would be regarded as lessauthoritative than others.   It is contrary to acceptedpractice for Government decisions to be announced in termswhich disclose or imply that they have been reached by aparticular Committee of the Cabinet.     Critics of the decisionreached by a particular Ministerial Committee would pressfor its review by some other Committee or by the Cabinet, whilethe constitutional right of Individual Ministers to speakin the name of the Government as a whole would be impaired.The underlying principle is, of course, that the methodadopted by Ministers for discussion among themselves ofquestions of policy la essentially a domestic matter, and isno concern of Parliament or the public.   The doctrine ofcollective responsibility of Ministers depends, in practice,upon the existence of opportunities for free and frankdiscussions between them, and such discussion is hamperedif the processes by which it is carried on are laid bare.For these reasons it is also the general peace-timepractice to avoid disclosure of particulars of the compositionand terms of reference of Cabinet Committees, other than ofone or two long-established Standing Committees.(CP. (49)95, paragraphs 29-32.)For earlier statements see CP. (45)100 andCP. (46)199.
Por the roaaoas given In paragraphs 30-31 of C.P.(49)95it is the custom to refuse to give, oven to Parliament,any information about the existence, terms of reference orcomposition of Cabinet Goriaittoea.     On 28th February, 1949the Cabinet were reminded of this rule (C.M,16(49)1).In exceptional circumstances details have been givenpublicly, particularly in time of war, and general statementshave on occasion been made about the Cabinet Coranitteo structure.The main reason for such disclosures is that a Cove, nmentsometimes finds It necessary, in response to public and- c-rliameatary pressure, to show that it has some organisationfor dealing with particular problems.     The disadvantages ofdisclosing the existence of Cabinet Committees are -(l) it tends to weaken the responsibility of Departmentalministers;   and (11) it makes it difficult subsequently toadjust the Committee machinery or the composition ofparticular committees.See generally Pile 4/1/21.Of Ministerial Committees new in existencethe following have been mentioned in officialstatements, i.e. in Parliamentary papers or inofficial Press announcements :-ftgfencp Committee:     the White Paper on thePoet-,Var Organisation of Defence (Cmd. 6923*1946) gave details of composition and functions.Sse also the debate in the House of Commons onCmd. 6923, Hansard, Vol. 428, Cols, 617-712,793-882,Mimsterlaa CfMinlttrftft pa 91YU PflfoMQi   inthe debate on the Second Heading of the CivilDefenoe Bill the Moms Secretary made a numberof general references to the existence of theCommittee.

It was further stated thatthe Prime Minister would himself preside overthis Committee for the time being.     (&quot;TheTimes&quot;, 30th September, 1947j Vl/3).(This statement did not in fact use the title &quot;^Bconomlc Policy Committee&quot;).     Details weregiven, without authority, by Mr. Francis,villiams (who was Adviser on Public Relationsto the Prims Minister from 1945 to 1947) in hisbook &quot;The Triple Challenge&quot; published in 1948.Production Committee:   in the statementIssued when sir Stafford Cripps was appointedMinister of ksonoraic Affairs in 1947 it wasannounced that he would preside over a Committeeof Ministers concerned with the day-to-day handoinjof production questions.     See File U/l/3(Part 3)    (Details were given by Mr. FrancisWilliams, without authority, In 1948:   see above).
torfl Prertflftayg QmM&amp;la&amp;i no specificstatement has been made daring the life-time ofthe present Government, but it is generally knownthat there is a Lord President^ Committee - oneof the main standing committees of theCabinet and the successor to the Home AffairsCommittee of previous administrations.     Forwar-time reference see below.He^sjat;on Ooft.4tteci   its functions wereoutlined in Sir John Anderson&apos;8 Romanes Lecturein 1946.    While there has been no specificofficial statement during the life-time of thepresent Government, this Committee, like theLord President^ Committee, is known as one ofthe main standing Committees to which referencehas frequently been made in official statementsin the past.    For war-time references seebelow.     (The work of the Committee, and alsoof the Future legislation Committee, is outlinedin the (confidential) Treasury booklet on thePreparation of Legislation).The CjtJJ, Aviation Oopillttflffl has frequentlybeen mentioned in (unauthorised) Pressreferences, which have also indicated that theiuord Privy Seal is Chairman.     See File 4/1/21.During the Second World War general state-meats were made in Parliament from time to timeabout the adjustment of the Co.a. it ee systemto meet changing needs.    The most importantof these statements are:-Ialtlal       Cabinet Comm^tee QrganlsaUofitHansard, House of Commons, 1st February, 1940,Cols. 1262-4 - statement by the Prime Minister(Mr. Chamberlain).,ig-prgaqiBaU?n after aBPQtFrtfflgpt ofoalltlon goyexnmn^f,   Hansard, House of Commons,th June, 1940, Cols. 769-771 r statement bythe Loru Privy Seal (Mr. Attlee).fWrhfrff agvfllftPnentB!

The arguments which justify the withholding of informationabout Ministerial Committees of the Cabinet do not have thesame force in respect of Official Committees, and in certaincircumstances it may be expedient not to withhold informationabout the existence of these Committees.     At the same timeit does not follow that such information should be freely given.The arguments against such disclosure (save in specialcircumstances) are that the inter-departmental machinery isnot readily understood outside Whitehall, and that there isa risk that disclosure (e.g. to parliament) would lead toill-informed discussions on the means of improvement.    Again,it is desirable to avoid giving an impression of a large andincoherent mass of Committees.     vastly the Official Committeesform part of the Cabinet Committee structure and are oftenclosely related to Ministerial Committees.     Neverthelessit may in certain circumstances be desirable not to withholdInformation about the existence of Official Committees.     Theircomposition should, however, not be disclosed:   the refusalto provide such information can be baaed on the principle ofthe anonymity of the Civil service.See File 4/1/21.     The question has beenraised particularly in relation to the selectCommittee on estimates of the House of Commons,and to iarliamentarw questions (see below).
Srskine Msy (24th Edition, page 337, paragraph (8)) listsas inadmissible questions which seek information about thedecisions or proceedings of the Cabinet, Committee of ImperialDefence, etc.   Nevertheless such Questions are occasionallypassed by the Clerk at the Table.     The answer normally takesthe form:   &quot;It would be against the public Interest to givethe information which the hon. Member seeks,&quot; or &quot;The arrange-ments made by the Cabinet for the discharge of the business forwhich it is collectively responsible are matters for theCabinet Itself and are not customarily disclosed.&quot;    Sometimesit may be desirable to try to have the Question withdrawn.See File 4/1/21.,For examples of refusal to give informationin reply to juestions, see Hansard, House ofCommons, 21st January, 1937, Col. 334 (asupplementary question about Cabinet discussionarising from the business statement) Hansard, House of Commons, 12th November,1945 Col. 1748 (Information refused aboutthe composition of the Man-Power Committee^ -Hansard, House of Commons, 10th December,1947, Col. 1006 (information refused aboutmeetings of the Defence Committee and attendanceof the Minister of Transport)^Hansard, House of Commons, 4th March, 1948,Col. 526 (information given about the functionsof the (Official) Economic information Committee,but its composition not disclosed * &quot;It wouldbe contrary to practice to disclose the namesof the officials who serve on this Committee&quot;).
&apos;     Details of the composition, terms of reference andauthority of the main standing committees of the Cabinet andtheir sub-committees are given in the current CommitteeOrganisation Book, copies of which are held by all Departments,and also by certain Commonwealth representatives.     The bookis normally revised completely at yearly intervals;   notesof amendments are also circulated at roughly monthly intervals.The current book includes In a separate part committeeB workingunder the Minister of Defence.     The current edition omits anumber of Committees of an ad&apos;hoc character;   a few are alsoomitted on grounds of particular secrecy.     Subordinatecommittees of officials are for the most part excluded.See Pile 7/2/3/1.The first consolidated list of committeeswas issued in September, 1939 (W. P. (G) (39)17).The first War Cabinet Committee Book was issuedin November 1939 (W. P. (O) (39) 93.)    A completerevise was circulated in March, 1941, and secondand third revised in July, 1942 and November 1944.The first   issue of the Committee Book underMr. Attlee&apos;s administration was in January, 1946;revises were circulated in March. 1947* March 1948and May, 1949.     Since March, 1947 the CommitteeBook has been in two parts, the first dealingwith Cabinet Committees, and the second withMinistry of Defence Committees.A detailed list of economic committees,including subordinate committees and workingparties was prepared in May, 1949.
The Cabinet Office are not concerned with committees whichdo not form part of the Cabinet Committee structure exceptwhere their work Impinges on that of Cabinet Committees.Thus the (Ministerial) Emergencies Coiixaittee may receivereports from an inter-departmental committee of Officialsunder Home Office chairmanship and served by a Home Officeaeorotary (the Emergencies (Official) Committee) and theCabinet Office Secretary of the Emergencies Comraittee keepsin close touch with tho committee of Officials.    On occasionan inter-departmental committee has been brought into theCabinet Committee structure;   likewise the status of anofficial Cabinet Committee la sometimes changed to that ofan ordinary inter-departmental Committee.In 1948 the Board of Trade assumedresponsibility for the Trade NegotiationsCommittee which had hitherto been an OfficialCabinet Committee.    See Pile 3Q/3A3-7      General responsibility for reviewing the number ofinter-departmental Committees and the demands they make on thetime of officials rests with the Treasury.     In the past,however, the Cabinet Office have on occasion been associatedwith them in efforts to secure a reduction in the number ofCommittees, largely because such reviews have been associatedwith similar reviews of Cabinet Committees.See generally Pile 48/38.In March, 1941 the Prime Minister(Mr. Churchill) circulated a note to Ministersin charge of iepartments on the means of securing  reduction in the number of Committees and inthe attendance at them.     Sach Minister wasrequired to achieve a 25?- reduction.     ThePrims Minister also laid down rules for thecond ct of Committees including advisory andconsultative bodies (W.P.(G)(41)34).In September, 1942 the Prime Ministerasked for reports from Departments on the stepstaken to reduce the number of Committees(W.P.(42) 419)*   These reports were rendered tothe Secretary of the Cabinet and a consolidatedreturn thereafter submitted to the Prime Minister.Subsequent reviews were made by the Treasury,the last in March, 1945 (Treasury Circular letterS.46009 of 21st March, 1945 - Pile 43/38 Pt.2.)In 1947 tha question of a further reviewwas considered by the Permanent Secretary to theTreasury and the Secretory of the Cabinet, butit was held that no good purpose would beserved by the issue of a further circular toDepartments.     (See Pile 48/38 (Part 3)).^w
