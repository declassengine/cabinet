mM    status/. Ta/pea of documentsThe documents of the Cabinet and its Committees (&quot;Cabinetdocuments&quot; or &quot;Cabinet papers&quot;) are of three main kinds(i)   Memoranda, submitting questions for decision orgiving general information;(ii)   Agenda, stating the business before a meeting;(iii)   Minutes or Conclusions, recording proceedingsand decisions.There are also various subsidiarydocuments, e.g. notices relating to meetings,corrigenda and addenda notices, schedules,indexes.    See p.     , and, for details, theCabinet Office Handbook and the Handbook forCommittee Clerks.j   Jtfltus, Ownexsfrjp and, CopyrightAll Cabinet documents are official documents andthe property of the Grown and they remain the property of theCrown throughout their existence.    Likewise the drafts ofCabinet memoranda are official documents:   once any documentis initialled for an official purpose it becomes an officialdocument and the property of the Crown.See Law Officers&apos; Opinion (193h) notedon p. V3 .3.         very document bears the heading &quot;This Document is theProperty of His Britannic Majesty*s Government&quot;.The practice of marking documents in thisway was introduced in respect of Foreign Officedocuments in 1692 by an administrative decisionof Lord Rosebery, then Foreign secretary.   Thepractice was thereafter generally adopted forseer t and confidential documents, includingCabinet memoranda (see File L/l/56).     It wasconfirmed by the ,.ar Cabinet in 1917 (&quot;arCabinet 217)*In 1931 prolonged interdepartmental discussion Itook place on the possibility ot finding analternative formula   which would avoid the useof the word &quot;Britannic&quot;.     The matter wasreferred to the Law Officers (Jowitt and Cripps)in May, 1931*     They recommended the phrase&quot;Secret and Confidential.     This document isthe property of His Majesty&quot;.     Objections were,however, retred and although it was intendedto refer the matter to Ministers, it was notin fact pursued..A modified formula has on occasion been used. , on documents prepared by the Cabinet Office for^Lrv &apos; *C Imperial and international conferences;   and in&quot;T^Ja^/iAz October, 19U8 at the time of the Commonwealtht^^^i^ctt- c^uL^. rrime Ministers Conference it was decided that/ww, the Conference documents should not be given thecustomary headings.

The proceedings of the Cabinet and ite Gomaittees(including Official Committees) are confidential, and theirdocuments are therefore &quot;classified&quot; anu bear securitymarkings according to current rules.     The marking assignedto a particular paper depends on the degree of secrecy withwhich it uiust be handled^    The security classification ofCabinet memoranda as such is normally &apos; secret&apos; or &apos;top secretbut they are sometimes marked &quot;confidential&quot;, particular noteson procedure.    Most Cabinet Committee memoranda are marked&quot;secret1.     The minutes of the Cabinet are invariably marked&quot;secret&apos;, and most Cabinet Committee minutes are marked&quot;secret&quot;,     The marking &quot;restricted1 is used on certaincorrigenda and on notices circulated to Official Committees onchanges in membership, etc.     The security marking is placed onthe left-hand side of the document immediately above the serialnumber and the date.     For &quot;top secret&quot; documents speciallyheaded paper is used.See generally File h/3/108.oome documents of Official Committees,particularly notes covering published documents,are marked &quot;unclassified&apos;, but this is to bedeprecated and such documents should be marked&quot;restricted*.The current security markings were introducedin April, I9kh, when the marking &quot;most secret&quot; wasabolished in favour of &quot;top secret9 in accordancewith United otates practice.     See T.C. Ho. 6/kk;File U/3/108 (Part 2).For the standard definition of the currentmarkings see Cabinet Office Handbook, pp. 13-21.In May, 1949 the practice was introduced inthe service Departments, Ministry of Defence andMinistry of Supply of placing the security markingin a central position at the top and bottom of eaohseparate page of a document.     The application ofthis practice (which is identical with the currentUnited states method) to the uoouments of the Cabinsand of civil departments was discussed by theInter-departmental Committee on Security in 1948.(See File h/3/108 (Part 2)).     It was decided,however, not to adopt it for Cabinet and CabinetCommittee documents, and the Departmentswhich adopted it for their own documents conformto Cabinet Office practice in submitting documentsto the Cabinet and Cabinet Committees.Until June. 1943 particularly secret documentsiven a restricted circulation were described as&quot;Lock and f.ey&quot; papers and carried in red a warningon the special precautions needed in their handling.On Ministry of Defence and certain otherDepartmental uocuments which it is important thatUnited otates representatives should not see it isusual to include in the heading the marking GU-oiD,in addition to the appropriate security marking,bee File 8/3/59.
The current notes on procedure stateMemoranda for the Cabinet should be as brief and asclear as possible.     The model memorandum explains at theoutset what the problem is, indicates briefly the relevantconsiderations and concludes with a precise statement of thedecision sought.     While it is sometimes useful to Include asummary of the main points brought out in the body of thememorandum, such a summary should never exceed a few lines;any longer summary defeats its purpose and simply meansrepetition.    So far as possible prefatory covering notesshould be avoided.     To facilitate reference in discussion,paragraphs should be numbered.     Supporting data may often berelegated to an Appendix.     If authority is sought to makea statement or despatch a telegram a draft may be attached.Time spent in making a memorandum short and clear will besaved many times over in reading and in discus don; and itis the duty of Ministers to ensure that this is done bypersonal scrutiny, and where necessary revision, of thememoranda submitted to them by their officials. Ta-J****x*a** /4 -%t(CP. (49)95, paragraph 10)7-        All cabinet documents, including those reproduced inDepartments, carry a standard heading showinb their date,the Committee or body concerned, their subject, and theirauthorship.    Additionally they are all marked &quot;Thisdocument   is the property of Els Britannic Majesty*s Government&quot;carry a security marking and, with few exceptions, a serialnumber and a copy number.    At the end of every memorandumtire given the author*s name or initials, the office oforigin and the date.In June, 1940 the Prime Minister(Mr. Churchill) ruled that the date shouldappear on the front page immediately under theserial number, and also at the end.    The dategiven should normally be that on which thememorandum was signed.    See minute of22nd June, 1940, File 48/1/5.It was laid down in December, 1931 that thepages of Cabinet memoranda oust be numbered.(CaL 89(31)3).In 1942 the Prime Minister (Mm Churchill)ruled that in statistical tables the totalsshould be shown either at the right hand sideand/or at the bottom of the page.    This rulewas enforced in all Departments, except in theRegistrar-General*s Office, where for specialreasons a different layout was retained.See File 48/x/33.s**. Rttr    /fi/z/i.m      ******     ^/j/^^-,
A standard form is followed in the agenda for meetings ofCabinet Committees:   there are certain slight differences inCabinet Agenda.     In addition to the customer., headingsand an Indication of the place, date and time of meeting,the Agenda paper lists the subjects to be discussed in theorder in which they are to be taken, with references to thelast discussion of the subject (if any), and to the memorandato be considered.     The Agenda carry the signature of theSecretary.     The Cabinet Agenda are normally seen in draft bythe Prime Minister, and in the case of certain Committees theChairman likewise approves the draft.     Provisional agenda arenot normally issued.The &quot;Previous Reference&quot;, if any, is normallyto the minutes of the body concerned, but inspecial circumstances it may be to theproceedings of a different body.    Thereference is never to an earlier memo random.If it is desirable to refer to such a memorandumit is expressed as &quot;relevant&quot; to the discussionin a note below the reference to thememortiadnm to be discussed.     Occasionally,on Cabinet agenda, the &quot;Previous Reference* isnot given if it is likely to provoke requests fore. g. copies of a Confidential Annex not generallycirculated;   the reference is, however, givenwhen the relative minute is prepared.&quot;Previous References&quot; to the minutes ofIan earlier administration should not be given.Exceptionally, previous references from theCabinet minutes of the Caretaker Government were,in a few instances, quoted in the documents ofMr. Attlee*s administration.     See note of17th January, 1946, Pile 7/3/1.The order of items is determined by theSecretary under the authority of the Chairman.The headings of the items are determined by theSecretary;   they may not necessarily be the sameas the titles of the memoranda to be discussed.On grounds of security a generalised heading issometimes to be preferred.f. The Agenda paper also constitutes an invitation to themeeting.     In the case of the Cabinet and of MinisterialCommittees, the Agenda paper gives in a note at the foot thenames of Ministers who are not Members required to be present,together with an indication of the items for which they are toattend, and, if necessary, a note of the approximate time.On   abinet Agenda Ministers are given by name and not byoffice.     If -the officials are asked to be present at MinisterialMeetings they are usually shown on the Agenda by office andnot by name.lo.         On the Agenda for meetings of Official Committees theattendance of officials who are not members may be indicatedeither by listing their names or by a general reference,e.g. &quot;representatives of.....&quot;Prior to the Second World War it wasusual, when additional business was to betaken at a Cabinet meeting, to circulate asupplementary Agenda.     The current practice isto issue, if time permits, a Revised Agenda or,
if necessary, a   second   evised Agenda,^dternatively a momoranduin circulated forconsideration at a Cabinet meeting forwhich the agenda paper has already been issuediaay carry a note indicating that it is to be takenunder a particular item or as an additionalsUfiU&amp;ftfiThe front or outside pfigft of the minutes glTes in aduitionto customary headings, the place, date and time of the meeting;a list of those present, distinguishing between members andothers;   and the names of the members of the secretariatpresent.      he list notes the chairman and the items forwhich those present attended, if not present throughout.The names of Ministers ore given in order of precedence;of officials in order of precedence of their Departmentsand rank.    The names of the members of the secretariatare given in order of rank.    Letters of honours ordistinctions are not given, except, where appropriate:&quot;The Rt. non&quot;,   &quot;M.P.&quot;,   &quot;K.C.&quot;The formula Introducing the list of thosepresent who are not members is &quot;The followingwere also present&quot;, but if the number is onlyone or very small it is &quot;Also Present&quot;.     Li^e-wise, if the secretariat consists of onlyone member he is shown as &quot;Secretary&quot;.In the listing of officials it is sometimesdesirable to follow the order of rank and notof precedence of Departments.Before the second World ..&apos;ar it was customaryto include letters of honours and distinctionsgenerally.     In September, 1939 the Kingagreed that this was unnecessary.     See letterof llth September, 1939, File V3/7.
Before the body of the minutes a table oft contents, withreferences to numbers of items and pages, is given.     If onlyone subject is dealt with this table is headed &quot;Subject&quot; andnot &quot;Contents&quot;,The contents list was first introduced,for Cabinet minutes, in January, 1939*Pile 4/5/24./3The individual minutes are numbered serially in the orderin which the subjects were in fact discussed at the meeting.i.e. not necessarily the order of items given on theAgenda.     The headings are chosen by the Secretary.     InCabinet minutes they are given at the side, with the previousreference below;   in other minutes the headings are givenimmediately above the body of the minute.     Sub-headingsare given if appropriate:   if given, they are normallyembodied also in the table of contents.The use of side headings in Cabinetminutes follows long tradition and is justifiablesince they are subsequently thus printed.     SomeCommittee minutes occasionally give sideheadings, but the practice is uneconomicalof space and inconvenient when the papers arebound./V-     Sach minute consists of (ij a statement of the -jitterbefore the meeting with references to any memoranda;   (ii) asummary of the main points in discussion; and (ill) a state-ment of the conclusions of decision.On the form of Cabinet conclusions the current notes onprocedure stateIt is an instruction to the Secretary, in draftingCabinet Conclusions, to avoid, so far as practicable, referenceto opinions expressed by particular Ministers.     The recordin respect of each item will be limited to the decision of theCabinet, together with such summary of the discussion as maybe necessary for the guidance of those called upon to tateaction on the decision.    Matters of exceptional secrecy maybe recorded in a &quot;Confidential Annex&quot;.(CP. (49)95, paragraph 19)This instruction, with minor changes, hasappeared in successive versions of the notes onprocedure.     When the first Labour Cabinet tookoffice in 1924 the Secretary was instructed torecord conclusions only *with necessary explanatorynotes1 (Cab. 7(24)1), but somewhat fullerminutes were gradually introduced.On the general style of minutes see thenotes circulated by the secretary of the Cabinetand Pile 4/2/20.Incidental references to purely politicalsetters are normally not recorded, and on suchmatters and other delicate references the CabinetSecretariat exercise discretion.     It is open tothe Prime Minister to give express directionsthat certain matters under discussion are to ceexcluded froa the formal record, but this is rare.On the general practice as regards omissions seeS. and P. 695.
Where a subject discussed by the Cabinet is of particularsecrecy the Cabinet minutes may contain only b token minute,the substatire minute being prepared la the form of aConfidential Annex and given a vary restricted circulation.The token minute usually consists of a brief statement of thematter before the Cabinet, followed by the formula TheCabinet&apos;e discussion and the conclusions raaahad are recordedin the Secretary Standard File of Cabinet Conclusions&quot;.(Sometimes the conclusions, in whole or part, are includedin the &quot;open&quot; minute).    The substance of the Annex la oftenembodied in the printed version of the minutes of the needfor special secrecy has disappeared.   Ia the case ofCommitteea a discussion of particular secrecy may likewisebe recorded in a Confidential Annex:   the token minute aftera statement of the subject discussed, indicates that &quot;theCommittee&apos;s discussion and the conclusions reached arerecorded in a confidential annex&quot;.     Confidential annexesare normally fop Secret.For circulation of Confidential Annexesboo p. iTho &quot;Secretary&apos;s standard File&quot; ofCabinet Conclusions is the set of minutes andconfidential annexes maintained for tho use oftho Secretary of the Cabinet.   The currentparts of this aet are takes to meetings of theCabinet for reference.   In due course minutesaad annexea are bound and kept in the PrivateOffice.^   When a matter disc us Bed by tho Cabinet (or by a MinisterialCommittee) ia of exceptional secrecy snd delicacy no recordat all may bo made.   Sometimes a &quot;ao circulation record&quot; iamade, i.e. a typed note which is kept io tho Secretary&apos;avolume of minutes and confidential annexes.   Very occasionallya copy of such records la given to the Prime Minister or aMinister particularly concerned.   Some such records arepreserved in sealed envelopes (bound with the Secretary&apos;avolume) to bo opened only by him or his deputy.f 7   The minutes of tho Cabinet and its Committees are notnow expressed as drafts when they are circulated. /AEffect is^however, given by means of a corrigendum notice^ to/amendmentssabaequently agreed,   If the Secretary feels doubt about aparticular suggested amendment he normally submits the matterto the Chairman.Until tho appointment of tho War Cabinetin September, 1939 it was customary for thedraft of tho Cabinet Conclusions to besubmitted to the Prims Minister for approval.They wore thereafter circulated la draft,final copies being issued later.Hiring the period 1939-45 the minutes inseveral Committee series wore circulated indraft.Ob the amendment of Cabinet minutes the current notes onprocedure states-Any suggested amendments to Cabinet Conclusions mustreach tho Secretary not later than the next day but onofollowing that on which the Meeting was held.   Thereafter thoConclusions will bo seat to be printed 1b final form.(CP.(1*9)95, paragraph 21)
Miscellaneous documents issued by the Cabinet OfficeInclude notices relating to meetings (e.g. provisional notice,cancellation, change In place or time);   notices op corrigendato memoranda and minutes, schedules of outstanding conclusions,and indexes.    All these documents bear the custo ary headings.Meeting notices (i.e. notice of a meetingin advance of the circulation of the Agenda)are not normally iesued unless delay is livelyto be incurred in the circulation of the Agenda.Schedules of outstanding conclusions(&quot;Black Lists&quot;) are not Issued in all Committeeseries.     For the Cabinet schedule see Part I.For indexes and indexing see p.
It la usual far all documents to carry, In addition totoo appropriate headings, a distinguishing symbol forreference purposes.    For standing committeea, and ad hoecommittees which are likely to last for a fairly substantialtime, the symbol customarily consists of two parts:   (a) oneor more letters from the Initials of words in the title oftho Committee and (b) the last two figurea of tho year labraokets, e.g. P. G. (1*9).    Tho same symbol cannot ho given tomore than one Committee, at least while they are contemporarywith each other;   a register of symbols is therefore keptby the Heoords Bootion, and if it is found that the lettersfirst choaon have boon already used far a committee whichwas active within a recent period other letters must be found.Whore two Committees are aot up on tho same subject, oneof Ministers and the other of officials, It is usual to usethe same symbol, distinguishing the Official Committee by theaddition of &quot;0&quot;.    Sometimes the Ministerial Committee isdistinguished by the addition of &quot;M&quot; but this is notnooeseary unless the pMn symbol is already in use for anotherCommittee.For sub-committees it is quite common to use symbolsIncorporating the symbols of the parent committee, but themultiplication of initial letters la la general to beavoided.In tho Cabinet series tho symbol used for memoranda(&quot;CP,&quot;) la different from that uaod for minutes (&quot;CM.&quot;).Committees, however, use tho earns symbol for all theirdocuments, distinguishing between tho different kinds byusing plain aerial numbers for memoranda (e.g. F.O. (49)1, 2,3 eta.) and ordinals for meetings (e.g. P.c(49) 1st Meeting,2nd Meeting, etc.)     (Tho same symbol la ueed for thecorresponding Agenda paper).Committees retain the same symbol throughout their Ufaeven if their titles changei   thus tho former home PolicyCommittee is now known as the Legislation Committee, but thesymbol la still &quot;H.P.C.*If, after a change of Government, tho now Government appoints,Committees with the same terms of reference as those of tho oldthose committees have been given the same titles and symbol.This makes it necessary* in order to avoid confusion, tobegin the series of the new Government&apos;e Committee with theserial numaer next following the laat of the old Government&apos;ssoMes.When the Legislation Committee was re-appointed by the present Government thememorandum announcing its appointment wasH.P.C. (45)67 and the first meeting underthe new administration wae H. P. 0. (45) 16th Meeting.Ao.   At the beginning of each calendar year the serialnumbering of all Committee document8 le recommenced.Committee of Imperial Defence documentswere numbered continuously in four aeries.Prior to the establishment of the CabinetSecretariat in December, 1916, Cabinet documentswere not numbered.    Memoranda ware numbered
continuously from 1919 until the end of 1922,(too last was CP. 4379).    The year numberwas thereafter Included in the symbol; thereafterthe numbering has been recommenced annually.The meetings of the Var Oabinet of 1916-19wore numbered serially throughout the period.Thereafter the minutes of Oabinet meetings havebeen numbered serially within each calendaryear, but symbols were not used until theappointment of the   ar Cabinet in 1939* whenthe symbol tf-M. was introduced.At the beginning of the second -orld   ar,.ar Cabinet memoranda were circulated in threeseries W.P. - papers of a very secret character;W.P.(G) - papers of a less secret character;**.r. (B) - periodical reports submitted to the.*ar Cabinet.    The series w.p. (0) and ft&apos;.P. (..)did not persist, the last documents in theirseries being issued in 1941 anu 1942,  &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;respectively.    Pile 48.When the Caretaker Government succeeded theCoalition Government in May, 1943 and WarCabinet was dissolved, the symbols CP. and CM.superseded w.p. and w.M. and the numberingwas recommenced.    On the. appoiatmsnt of theLabour Government the serial numbering wascarried on.    Thus the first meeting of theLabour Cabinet is recorded as CM. (45) 18thConclusions;   and the first Cabinet paper ofMr. Attlee1 s administration is CP. (45)^C 3/.  spaoial arrangements are in force for allotting referencenumbers to the documents of Committees or Conferences whichare neither of an Informal character or of a strictly sAJMtftkind.    The symbols consist of the letters GSM followed by anumber which ie the individual number of the Committee.    Theyear number is not used since it is assumed that none of theseCommittees will last long e ough to make this necessary.In practice, however, several of the Committees in the GSMseries have lasted more than one calendar year.Sometimes memoranda (particularly reports from Committees)are circulated simultaneously in two series.    In that eventthey carry the symbols and serial numbers appropriate to bothbodies, with the necessary adjustments in the order and inthe headings.    It is very rare for a memorandum circulatedto the Oabinet to be expressed also as the document of asubordinate body.    An appendix to a Cabinet memorandum may onoccasion be circulated to a subordinate body, but it isusually accompanied, when so circulated, by a note by thedecretar^ of the Committee concerned.The present GNH series started inDecember, 1942*    Previously the symbolemployed was MISC.   See Pile 4/5/39*
*      Memoranda for the Cab5.net are normally sent la draft tothe Cabinet office, and they are then either sent to theForeign Offloe Press for printing or, if there is insufficienttime for printing, reproduced by stencil   duplicating.Memoranda for Cabinet Committees are, save in special oiroum-stances, reproduced in the Departments responsible for them.See paragraph 11 of O.P.(49)95 and,generally, File 4/3/151.     The responsibilityof Departments for the reproduction of theirown Committee memoranda wat rtated in a circularlet er of 26th March, 1947 from the Secretaryof the Cabinet to private Secretaries(File4/3/15D.   Previously the Cabinet Of floeand Departments had shared the work ofreproducing Cabinet Committee memoranda.Before and during the Seoond vorld War it   wasusual for Departments to reproduce their   wnmemoranda for the Cabinet as well as forCommittees.2V    Memoranda, where printed, are prepared on pale greenfoolscap paper, except procedural memoranda by the PrimsMinister which are printed on white quarto.     In additionto Cabinet memoranda some few Committee memoranda especiallylong reports, are printed.    Sometimes a memorandum Initiallyduplicated is subsequently printed for permanent record, theduplicated copies being recalled.The use of Foreign Offloe Press for printingCabinet memoranda hae a long tradition behind it.See historical notes in File 4/1/56.In the past some Departments (Foreign OfficeIndia Office, Dominions Offloe. Colonial Office)have dealt direct with the Foreign Offioe press.This has, however, deprived the Cabinet Offioeof an opportunity of seeing the text of memorandabefore they are reproduced and it is now thenormal practice for the text to be seat to theCabinet Office in the first instance.     (The WarOfflee still sometimes print Cabinet memorandaon their own press.)-2 3&quot;     Where draft Bills are to be attached to memoranda oopleaare provided by Parliamentary Counsel.     White Papers for submie-sion to the Cabinet are printed either by the Stationery Offioeor by the Foreign Offioe Press (which is run by the StationeryOffioe):   the Department concerned is responsible for ensuringthat the necessary copies are provided.     To avoid doubletype setting they should be set up from the outset for ootavoprinting.U,    when memoranda are to be reproduced in the originatingDepartment, the Department apply to the Cabinet   office for theserial numbers.     They are required to send all copies to theCabinet Office.See paragraph 11 of CP. (49)95*Periodic returns are -ade of the numberof memoranda in the several series reproducedIn the Cabinet Offioe and in Departments.See File 4/3/151.
2/-    These documents are always reproduced in the Cabinet Office.After a lapse of time for any necessary corrections the minutesof the Cabinet and the Defence Committee are printed and theduplicated versions are recalled.    Any amendments required areembodied in the printed version (significant amendments arecirculated in advance of printing by means of a corrigendumnotice);     and the opportunity is sometimes taken of incorporatingthe substance of confidential annexes if the need for specialsecrecy has in the interval been reduced.     Confidential annexesare not themselves printed.On the circulation of  Inutes in draft seep.Mathoda of Reproduction0.8.    Until April, 1940 memoranda and minutes reproduced by stencilduplicating were typed in double-spacing.     In 1948 It wasdecided that memoranda of Official Committees should bereproduced on both sides of each sheet of paper.See Pile 48/25 (Part 3)-In 1949 methods of reproduction wereexamined by an informal Committee under thechairmanship of an officer of the TreasuryOrganisation and Methods Division.     SeeFile 4/3/310.
GeneralThe documents of the Cabinet and Ministerial Committeesare issued primarily to the King and Ministers.The need for secrecy calls for special care in circulationand handling.     The circulation of the documents of the Cabinetis the responsibility of the Secretary of the Cabinet, subjectto the general approval of the Prime Minister.     The circulationof Cabinet Comaittee documents is the responsibility of theSecretary of the Committee subject to the Coalman and under thegeneral supervision of the Secretary of the Cabinet.Where Departments themselves reproduce memoranda forcirculation to Cabinet Committees (and, exceptionally, to theCabinet itself) they are required to send all copies to the;Cabinet Office.    Kach copy made is given a copy number and theissue of each is recorded on the circulation sheet or ,skin&apos;.Documents are issued to individual recipients by name.
So.  The current notes on procedure state:-Subject to such special instructions in regard to anyparticular paper as be may receive from the Prims Minister orfrom the responsible Minister, the Secretary circulatesmemoranda and other documents prepared for their use to allmembers of the Cabinet, and. where appropriate, to otherMinisters whose Departments are affected.(C.P.(49)95* paragraph 12).The circulation of eaoh memorandum must be determinedseparately.    Where a memorandum is of a Departmental characterall Ministers concerned with its subject matter receive copies.Memoranda of general interest (e.g. on the proceedings of theUnited Nations, the International Labour Organisation, etc.)are given a full circulation to all Ministers of Cabinet rank,as are likewise notes on points of procedure and organisation.Memoranda of general political or constitutional interest aregiven a full circulation, unless the need for specialsecrecy makes it undesirable to circulate beyond the Cabinetitself.The circulation list provides, in certain cases, forMinisters to receive memoranda in duplicate or triplicate.Where the need for special secrecy so requires the numberissued is sometimes reduced.     Standing arrangements aresometimes made (see C.P. (49)95, paragraph U) for the supplyto Ministers of additional copies of their own memoranda.3f   The English Law Officere   receive copies of memoranda onlegal issues and on general issue of policy,with constitutionalor legal implications.     The Lord Advocate: newnally,&apos;&quot;; receives thesame memoranda;     few are ordinarily eent to the Solicitor-General for Scotland.See Pile 4/3/56.?qqj;nr ministers do not normally receive memoranda;   ifin the absence of the Senior Minister a Junior Miniater attendsa Cabinet meeting he normally makes use of the memorandaissued to the Minister himself.The Chief Whip receives memoranda onParliamentary matters, including, as a rule,memoranda covering draft vhite Papers.Pile 4/3/242.The Economic   Secretary, Treasury receivesmemoranda on economic questions.The Chiefs of Staff   receive copies of memoranda onmilitary and strategic matters and of memoranda on politicaland constitutional questions which may have strategicimplications.     (If the Chiefs of staff Secretariat aregiven a copy of memoranda not sent to the Chiefs of Staffthemselves the Secretariat are informed accordingly.)During the Second World War the Chiefsof Staff received copies of all War Oabinetmemoranda.    See Pile 48 (Part I)
y r-  The only DaoartJiintal ofrloials to whom copies of memorandaare regularly sent are the Permanent secretary to the Treasuryand the Permanent Under-Secretary of state for Foreign Affaire.Certain Treasury officials are provided direct with copiesof particular memoranda, hut with a few exceptions, e.g. the headof the Army Council secretariat, memoranda are not usually sentto officials.In the period 1939-45 copies were morefrequently sent direct to officials.    Before theoutbreak of war the issue of memoranda toofficials was extremely rare.Cabinet memoranda are sometimes sent tothe head of the subordinate Departments of theTreasury.    The usual practice la to informths private^secretary to the Chancellor of theExchequer accordingly.     Other subordinateDepartments (e.g. the Registrar General&apos;sDepartment) are not normally sent copies;   theparent Departments are expected to keep theminformed on matters of special concern to them,see File i^fi^fyJr.   Parliamentary Counsel receives direct copies of memoranda ofconcern to him.Before 1939 Parliamentary Counsel receivedoopies, when necessary, through the Treasury.3^- In the Cabinet Secretariat copies are normally sent inaddition to the secretary, to the Deputy Secretary (Civil)the Deputy Secretary (Military) and the Under Secretary.Assistant secretaries have access in the Private Offioe tsthe volume of memoranda kept for their use.     (This volumenormally does not contain  Top Secret&apos; memoranda.)The Chiefs of Staff Secretariat receive oopies ofmemoranda Issued to the Chiefs of Staff.    They may onoccasion reoeive other memoranda, but if so they are advisedof the fact.57 In 1940 Mr. Chamberlain, for a short tinsafter he ceased to be a member of Government,received copies of Cabinet documents.     -Seeminute of///,*/V0   File 4y3/&apos;*In April, 1931 the Labour Cabinet consideredthe question whether certain documents mightbe shown to leading members of ths Liberal Party.They decided that &quot;(a) ae a matter of principle itwould not be right to treat a Committee ofMembers of Parliament who belong to another party onthe same footing ae members of the Cabinet, who, asPrivy Councellors, have taken an oath of secrecy!the members of that party must oo regarded generallyas b*ing in the same position as other Membere ofParliament;   (b) the Prime Minister should discusswith Mr. Lloyd George with a view to arrangingsome appropriate procedure; possibly, for example,by allowing the leader of the party concerned tosee the papers and to make a statement based thereonto the Members of Parliament co-operating with himin this matter&quot;.

There werealso specially secret *A* minutes which theSecretary wrote out in his own hand end whichhe occasionally showed to the Prime Ministeror Mr. Balfour for approval before having themput away.    Pile 48/1 (note of 23rd September, 1933On 4th November, 1919 the Cabinet (1(19)3)decided that the draft conclusions and finalconclusions should be sent only to the Ring, thePrime Minister, and the Leader of the House ofLords.    In addition Ministers in charge ofDepartments specially concerned in particularconclusions were to receive copiee of these)conclusions.    Conclusions were not to be sent tothe Permanent Secretaries of Departments or tothe Chiefs of Staff.On 8th March, 1922, in view of a series ofunauthorised disclosures, the Cabinet decided(16(22)3) that the Cabinet Conclusions should begiven no circulation at all)    the Secretary vanasked to maintain a copy for reference byMinisters, and to notify conclusions by letter tothose concerned.     (After the meeting at which tots^deoislon was taken the Secretary arranged with thePrime Minuter that copies would continue to besent to the King).     By October, 1922, however,full circulation (23 Ministers) had been resumed.War Cabinet conolusione (1939*45) were sent toall members of the far Cabinet, to all Ministerswho held offices represented in the Cabinet beforethe outbreak of war, and the Ministers ofInformation and Economic warfare and the Chiefsof Staff.    see Pile 48/1.
o-     It is stated in the current notes on procedure that-copies of Confidential Annexes1 are sent only to the Ministersdirectly concerned&quot;   (CP. (49)95, paragraph 20).    The King andthe rrime Minister invariably receive copies;   and copies areusually sent to Ministers very closely concerned with the subjectmatter or required to take action.     It is usual for thsSecretary of the Cabinet to send a copy (under cover of a minute)to a member of the Cabinet prevented from being present at thsdiscussion recorded.

But although standardlists are in use, documents may on occasion need to be givena restricted circulation;   equally some documents or extracts ofMinutes may need to be sent to Departments not on the standardlist.Chiefs of staff QppBift^On the circulation of Chiefs of Staff Committee papersService Ministers see notes in s. and P.

Documents for transmission in these boxesare not normally sealed in envelopes, exoept Top Secretdocuments, which are enclosed in envelopes sealed with aspecial label.

SBHDIKG OF nooraijyWfl QVSAaMAMT-3&quot; The general rule is that Cabinet documents, i.e. memorandaand minutes of the Cabinet and any of its Committees, are not tobe taken or sent out of the country %   it is a fftgefl milthat Cabinet minutes are in no circumstances to be taken or sentout.This general rule has frequently been broken, both duringthe period of the War Cabinet and since.     There are threeimportant points:   (a) the prior consent of the Cabinet Officemust be obtained by Departments, each application beingconsidered on its merits;   (b) secure means of transmission mustbe used;   (o) a list of documents sent overseas must be keptby the Cabinet Office or the Departments, as the case may be.Copies of some series of Official Committee documents areregularly tent overseas, to asbassles, Missions, etc;   MinisterialOorauittee documents and Cabinet memoranda more rarely.     Thegrounds for the-a restrictions are mainly security, but there isalso the need to avoid misunderstanding and the misinterpretationof isolated documents as having full Cabinet authority and asstatements of approved policy.     To avoid such misunderstandingit is often desirable for the form of the document in question tobe such as to give no indication that it is a Cabinet document./The main occasions on which Cabinet memoranda . ay be tentoverseas aret-(a) when the King is on a visit abroad.     In 1938 when theking visited Canada and the United states, a collection ofimportant memoranda for reading on the return Journey weresent by sea in charge of the Captain;   they were, however,not landed from the ship.    See File 4/3/83.(b) On official visits by Cabinet Ministers abroad.    SeeFile 4/3/89/1.Zn 1932, at the beginning of the DisarmamentConference in Geneva, that Cabinet decided(10(32)3) that Ministers in the United KingdomDelegation should have discretion to arrangeto receive in Geneva copies of Cabinet Minutesand Memoranda on the understanding that they wereresponsible for ensuring the safety of thedocuments In Geneva and for their return assoon as they were no longer required.Exceptionally copies of oertaln Cabinet minuteswere taken out of the country for the purposes ofthe Yalta and Potsdam Conferences during theSecond world War.(o) For the general information of Ministers ResidentOverseas during the Second World War.    See Files 4/1/43.14/31/40, 48/46/1, 48/54, 48/57.(d) For the general information of Missions, etc, abroad.Thus Chiefs of Staff documents are, in certain oases sent toCoiaaanders-in-Chief overseas.     See File 48/1/4.(e) For the general information of certain -Ambassadors.In 1941, when Lord Halifax was appointed H,m* ambassador inWashington while remaining a member of the War Cabinet, it wasarranged, with the approval of the Prime Minister, that heshould be given for general information copies of importantCabinet memoranda.    These were ssnt at intervals under cover
of a letter from the Secretary of the War Cabinet indicating theWelt Cabinet *s decisions on them and adding background information.This arrangement was continued  when Lord Inverehapel and laterSir Oliver Franks were appointed to the Embassy at Washington,since it was recognised that the importance of the post was suchthat it was highly desirable to supply its holder with generalbackground information on the Cabinet &apos;s proceedings.   See File4/3/187      In 1946 it wae agreed that the British MilitaryGovernor in Germany should b-s sent copies of Cabinet and CabinetCommittee memoranda bearing on German problems.     The selectedmemoranda were sent through the Foreign Office with a note,supplied by the Cabinet Office, of the relevant conclusions.See File 4/3/255-It was also arranged, in 1948. at the request of the ForeignSecretary, that His Majesty *s Ambassador in Paris should be givencopiee of certain Cabinet memoranda on the development of aWestern Union policy.    See File 4/3/247.    All thesearrangements are exceptions, and in all cases it was stressed thatthe Cabinet memoranda in question were being sent only forpersonal information and for purposes of general backgroundguidance:   instructions, as always would come from the ForeignOffice. 9See generally File   4/o/&apos;o4-//3In October, 1948 it was agreed that copieeof Oversea Defence Committee memoranda beingsemt overseas might be despatched without theremoval of headings, symbols,etc.,    indicativeof their orLgin.     See File 4/3/lA.In October, 1944, Sir Noel Charles(tt.M. Ambassador in Rome) asked for copies ofCabinet papers on Soviet Policy in the Balkans  &apos;and Europe.     It was recommended that the ForeignOffice should prepare a despatch containing thenecessary information from the Cabinet documentsbut making no reference to the origin of theinformation.     File 4/3/247.
h-f. It is a standing rule that in no ciroumetanoee are Cabinetor Cabinet Coataittee memoranda to be reproduced or copied inDepartments.    where a memorandtsa is reproduced in a Departmentfor purposee of circulation all copies made must be sentto the Cabinet Office, application being made to the CabinetOffice for any additional copies required by the reproducingDepartment.    See O.P. (U9) 95 paragraphs 11 and 13*So.  The current notes on procedure statet-Where a Department has to take action upon, or Is other-vise directly effected by, a particular Conclusion, and theactual decisions of the Oabinet on that matter may be copiedin the Department, together with so much of the record ofthe discussion as is essential to a proper understanding ofthem, and these extracts may be passed to responsible officersin the department, as may be necessary.     The distributionwithin a Department of such extracts from Cabinet Conclusionsshould be limited to the occasions on which it is strictlynecessary for the efficient discharge of publlo business andears should be taken to see that extracts are sent only to theseoffioere of the Department who need be acquainted with theactual terms of the decision.    Duplicate copiee of the completeConclusions are not issued for this purpose by the CabinetOffice eave in exceptional cases.(o.p. (h9)95 paragraph 23)
The rules governing the handling of minutes (see above,mean that no full verbatim copy of a Cabinet minute shouldbe filed, but for the rest practice is known to vary fromone Department to another.Apart from the rules governing the handling of Cabinetminutes the Cabinet Offlee have not issued general guidanceto Departments.    The following notes constitute., however,a reasonable basis on which enquiries from Departments maybe handled:-Catolttft nBfl MlBlsttflsisearing a direct Departmental interestbe placed on registered files:   thoss which have a mainlypolitical interest will not be filed.    This will usuallymean that a papsr may bs filed when a brief has been preparedon that paper.    Where a paper makes a proposal which isaccepted by Ministers and Is to be made public at a laterdate, the paper should not be filed until after the publicannouncement baa been made, unless the file is given thesame security classification as the paper itself.     Once theproposal has been made public the need, eo far ae thatparticular item is concerned, for giving the file a securityclassification will have disappeared.     //here proposals inCabinet, etc., papers are not subsequently made public, caremust be taken that the files which include them continueto bear the appropriate security classification.the papers ma^s this necessary,(b) WH&amp;LIttlilHIffHwJ-Ho minutes or extracts of minutes should be placedon registered files.    Conclusions only of meetings of theCabinet and of Ministerial Committees may be placed on registeredfiles, provided the files are given and retain the appropriatesecurity classification.Official ffOM^UMlMinutes and conclusions may bs placed on registered filesprovided those files are given, and retain so long asls&amp;ary, the appropriate security classification.These notes are based on the practicelaid down in the Treasury in 1946 (Treasury notice33/46) after discussion with the Cabinet Offlee.See Pile 4/2/36.The matter was discussed in 1933 in relationto the procedure to be adopted in   &apos;weeding&apos;files for trans.er to the Public record Office,and at a conference under Treasury Chairmanshipon 25th October, 1933 agreement was reached ona set of rules(a) Ho full verbatim copy of Cabinet Minutesany be put in a Departmental file;   a copy of
of the actual conclusion may be filed Inaccordance with usual Departmental practice;(b) .. or CI.D, Committee paper ora Cabinet or Cabinet Committee memorandum ona defence topic, may be placed only In a aeeretfile and most be removed before such file lasent to the Publlo Record Office;(o) The filing of Cabinet and CabinetCommittee memoranda other than the above shouldbe avoided as far aa possible;   when it isfound necessary, however, to file suchdocuments the procedure on weeding should be thatthe department doing tho weeding, in consultationwith the Department from which the documentoriginated, should decide whether or not itshould be left with documents to be transferredto tho Public iecord Office,These rules were not in the end circulated.See generally Piles k/2/kk /aadr1 and 2.In April, 19hk, it was agreed that theForeign Office should have discretion to placeConfidential Annexes and Cabin t minutes in theForeign Office Secret Registry Files, in anyoaae whether they considered it necessary.It was stipulated that Annexe8 recording mattersof very special secrecy or of political signif1-cance from the point of view of the Unitedkingdom should be kept in the Private office.File L/2/36.QeagfaA ^Vtaapoe by the Cabinet PflTlgeFrom time to time the Cabinet Of floe are asked foradvice on the arrangements which should be adopted in handlingCabinet documents.     ouch requests are usually met by referenceto the current notes on procedure and to Cabinet Officepractice or the known practice in other Departments.   It isimportant, however, that the Cabinet Offloe should notattempt to lay down in any detail how the general principlesshould be applied in a particular Department.    Ho set ofdetailed rules oan be applied uniformly to all Departments.Departmental instructions on this matter mast be left tothose who are familiar with the layout of the Department andthe personalities involved.

la spite of the special Measures taken to safeguardthem. Cabinet documents are sometimes lost la transmissionaed in Departments)   and there have been instances whereeoplea have been left la vehicles, clubs, etc.   Sometimesdocuments can be shown to here been inadvertently destroyedby fire or as secret waste, out the circumstances must laevery ease be fully investigated before duplicate copiesare Issued.   When the Cabinet Office ere informed by eDepartment that a document has not been receired by theindividual to whom it is addressed the first step is tosstablish from the Distribution Section when it wasdespatched, shea it was delivered to the Department sadwho signed for it on receipt.   It le often found thatalthough a document has been received la a Departmeat ithas been thereafter mislaid or seat to the wrong individual.If search fails to reveal the document It may be aeceeearyto arrange for the Cabinet Office Security Officer, inconsultation alii, the Department concerned, to make fartherenquiries.   In some oases it may be desirable to seek thehelp of the Security Service.See generally Piles h/3/h and U/2/18.
^V-.    The current notes on procedure state s-Cahlcet doouoeats remain the property of the Grown;   thenormal practice is, therefore, that Miniet rs, on relinquishingoffioe, return to the Cabinet Office all Cabinet documents, withthe exception of any immediately required for currentadministration, which may be handed on to their successors.In order to facilitate this arrangement, Ministare are askedto arrange for the return to the Cabinet office during theirtenure of office, say, at intervals of three to six months,of such Cabinet documents as are not required for currentadmini s tration.The provision above for handing on certain Cabinetdocuments to a Minister&apos;s successor does not always apply ona change of Government: special instructions will beIssued to cover such oases.(0.P.(h9)95. paragraph 25).ftflrtlM ttslrara fry ^uwtomterThe extent to which departments return documents nolonger required for current administration varies considerably.Some Departments tend to retain documents for long psriods,others return batches at fairly regular intervals.    Apartfrom certain special cases, pressure is not normally broughton Departments to return unwanted documents;   they were,however, reminded of the standing rule in a circular letterto Private Secretaries in Hay, 1949 (See Pile V3/8 Part 3).Bundles of returned documents should be accompanied by twoeoplee of a list of those included, the one for checking andretention by the Records section, and the other for eventualreturn to the Department as a form of receipt.     The documentsreturned are sorted in the Reoords Seotlon and either returnedto the respective skins or destroyed and a record made.
BbIufr gf PoflMfffttg tar MlPlcwgrt ana SaHtlaletyrgThe current rule is that Ministers, on relinquishing office,return to the Cabinet Office all Cabinet docvuaents, with theexception of any immediately required for current administration,which may be handed on to their successors.    This rule, whichderives from the polloy adopted b* the Cabinet in 195k(see below) Is based on the following considerations(a) Cabinet documents remain the property of the Crownthroughout their existence.(b) Former Ministers have normally no facilities for thesafe custody of secret documents]   it is in any case highlyundesirable that there should be a Max of Cabinet documentsfalling into undesirable bands and of unauthorised disclosurefra i them.(o) Former Ministers have a right of access in the CabinetOffice, on application to the decretory of the Cabinet, tothoee documents issued to them while in office.(d) On Ministerial changes in the life-time of oneadministration there le no   need for all documents to bewithdrawn to the Cabinet Oifioe.    This would in any case beImpracticable since the requirements of current administrationmust be met.^7   Action by the Cabinet office on a Ministerial change withinthe life-time of a single administration is therefore on thefollowing lines:   a letter ia sent to the - rivate decretaryto the outgoing Minister caking him to remind him of thestanding rule, i.e. that all dooumenta should be returnedto the Cabinet Office with the exception of those immediatelyrequired for cur. ent administration, which should behanded on to the incoming Mlnlater.     It is often convenientto take the opportunity of reminding the Private secretarythat those documents retained in the  apartment shouldbe reviewed and any not actually required returned to theCabinet office.    The i rivate deoretar., should also be askedto confirm in writing that the incoming Minister has teuton overhis predecessors documents   (See, for example, letters onFile 4/3/212).If the outgoing Minister indicates his intention toretain any particular document or documents the matter mustbe considered on merits and in the light of the circumstancesand personalities involved, and ordinarily the question offurther aotion should be submitted to the Prime Minister bythe secretary of the Cabinet.Mr. J. vilmot, on relinquishing office asMinister of bupply in October, 1947, stated thathe intended to retain certain Cabinet Co-malt teedocuments, notwithstanding that the standingrule had been brought to his attention.   Thematter was referred to the Prime Minister, butno further action wat recommended.    File 4/3/2^0.i hen ar. ii.

G.R.On Change of Government59*      The current notes can procedure state that specialinstructions will he issued on the practice to be followed onof Government (CP. (49) 95, paragraph 25)*3ueh ins tractions are based on the two principles (i) that thedoeuaents of one Administration should not be accessible to anotherwhich is of a different political complexion, and (ii) that Cabinetdocuments are the property of the Crown and may not be retained byMinisters who leave office, although this second rule has oa occasionsbeen relaxed to allow Ministers to retain documents which they wrotethemselves.   Per the instructions issued en recent changes ofGovernment see the historical notes below.39.3o

(It may be noted never-t be less that copies of some 0.1*1)* papers were retained onDepartmental files. e.g. in the War Office and the DoainloneOffice - eee Pile k/2/kh Part 1).    This practice was followedby the War Cabinet of 1916-19* but all the Governments from191J to 1931 (including tue Labour Government which resignedin 1931) took the view that Ministers could retain on leavingoffice such Cabinet documents as they desired.   It became thepractice for a Cabinet which was due to dissolve to adopt aconclusion at its last meeting In the following termsi-&quot;To adhere to the procedure of their predecessors inregard to Cabinet documents;   that is to say. Ministere shouldretain such Cabinet documents as they desire on the under-standing that as ex-Ministers they could have access toCabinet Minutee and other documents issued during theirterm of office.&quot;The only Cabinet during the period vhloh did not passsuch a resolution was that of the Conservative Government of192U-29, the explanation being that the Government resignedafter the General Election of May. 1929 without holding anyfurther meeting of the Cabinet.    There is no reason to doubtthat if they had considered the question they would have heldthe same view as the other Cabinets of the time.The doctrine was that a new Government was not entitledto have access to the documents of Its predecessors and thata Government which wiehed to refer to Cabinet papers orminutee of a previous administration ought to seek permissionfrom the Prims Minister of the Government which had issued thepapers.    At one time It was the practice for an outgoingadministration, as their final act. to authorise the Secretaryof the Cabinet to keep for record purposes a complete set iftheir papers.     (see Pile 7/3/1).
itfcjji taken la 1934c/-   In 1934 the question of the retention of Cabinetdocuments earns to the front ae a result of the publication ofa life of Mr. George Laos bury by hie son. Mr. Sdgar Lane bury(see Pile Pub./B/8).    As a   result the secretary of theCabinet, in March, 1934. submitted a memorandum to the Cabinetasking the following recommendations:-&quot;(a) That it shall be the duty of all Cabinet Ministers,on vacating office, to return forthwith all Cabinet Minutesand papers issued to them while in offioe, to the secretaryto the Cabinet;   and it shall be the duty of the Secretary tothe Cabinet to recover all such sapors accordingly.(b) That the same procedure shall be followed in the caseof Ministers outside the Cabinet on vacating office,(e) That ex-Cabinet Ministers shall oontinuo to hawsthe right of access to all Cabinet Mlnutee and papers issuedto them during the time that they were members of the Cabinet.(d) That the secretary to the Cabinet be instructed toinvite the representstives of deceased ex-Ministers toreturn forthwith to the Cabinet Offices all post-warCabinet Miautes and papers in their possession.(e) That the secretary to the Cabinet be instructedto write to living ex-Cabinet Ministers Inviting them toco-operate by returning their Cabinet minutes and papers tothe Cabinet Office to be kept there in safe custody for them. *These reeommendatlons were approved bw the Cabinet on2let March, 1934, subject to the substitution of the words&quot;members of previous Cabinets&quot; for &quot;ex-Cabinet Ministers&quot;in paragraph (o); and the Cabinet &quot;authorised the secretaryto put the proposals in operation in the spirit as well as inthe letter and endeavour to recover all documents from thetermination of the war onwards other than documents belongingto the present Government which Ministers wish to retainwhile la offioe&quot;   (Cab. 35(34;5).
fcsjf ,.PCXlflw&apos;fl.t. ftplltlwmIn June, 1934 a Lav Offloors * opinion (Ins kip andSemervell) was obtained about tbe rlgbt of Ministers to retainCabinet documents.     Briefly tbe opinion was:-(I) that,sines the Cabinet deoislon of 21st March. 1934did not purport to revoke the usual conclusion adoptedby Cabinets on vacating office, Cabinet Ministers stillhad a right to retain documents;(II) that although (1) applied strictly only to CabinetMinisters, it might be unwise to attempt to make adistinction between them and non-Cabinet Ministers inthe matters(ill) that clearly executors, administrators and assignshad no right of retention, and that an offence would becommitted under section 2 of the Official aecrets *ot, 1911if a Minister In future, or an executor or administratoror assign retained any of the documents in question.(It)   that once any document is initialled for an officialpurpose it becomes an official document and the propertyof His Majesty*s Government.See case for the opinion and the opinion(dated 18th June, 1934) on me 4/3/8A.The following is an extract from section 2of the Official ceorets Aot, 1911s-*If any person having in his possession orcontrol any... document .... which he hasobtained owing to his position as a person who ..has held offloe under  Ills Majesty communicatesthe document ... to any person, other than aperson to whom he is authorised to communicateit ... that person shall be guilty of amisdemeanour.*
atwrt t9 ?at*Mt in i?^Za November, 1935* toe Secretary of toe Cabinet submitteda report (C.r. (218(35)   on the outcome of the action takenon the decision of -arch, 1934.     In general the results weresatisfactory since nearly 90% of the outstanding documentshad been recovered.    A number of ex-Ministers had, however,refused to return their papers, and the report suggestedthat it would be best to make no further effort to recoverthe papers during the life-time of the Ministers concerned,but to approach their executors after their death.    Thisreport waa approved by the Cabinet (Cab. 51(35)10)*&apos;0t.   After the General Election of 1935 the Government wae ofthe same political complexion as its predecessor and therewas merely some reshuffling of posts.    Ministers wereasked to hand on their papers to their successors, and in oneor two oases where they were not bolng replaced they wereasked to return them to Cabinet Office.     After May, 1940this practice became even more strongly established.    Theexistence of % Government in which virtually all partieswere represented and which waa engaged in the single taskof waging war, meant that whenever a Ministerial change wasmade, papers were automatically handed on from one Ministerto another.The notes on War Cabinet procedure issuedin 1942 (Pile 4/1/6A) stateds-**In normal times it ie the duty of allMinisters, on vacating offloe, to return forth-with to the secretary to the Cabinet allCabinet papers Issued to them whilst In offioeand it is the duty of the Secretary to theCabinet to ensure that this rule is campledwith.     For the period of the war, however.Ministers vacating office should hand over totheir successors in offloe such War Cabinetpapers as are essential for the carrying onof the business of the Deportment.    Papers netso required should be returned to the WarCabinet Office periodically.....&quot;
Soms study was made of tbe matter at the end of 1944 and.later in April. 1945 when it was clear that the Coalitionwas likely to break up.    A submission wae made to the PrimeMinister on 18th April, 1945 suggestlngi-(a) Outgoing Ministers should be asked to hand over totheir successors all Cabinet documents required for currentadministration.(b) All Cabinet documents other than (a) should bereturned to the Cabinet Office.(o) Ministers who thought they might in future wishto refer to particular documents should be told that if theyhanded them over to tbe Cabinet office they would bs keptseparately so that they could have ready access to themwithout delay.In a minute of 30th April. 1945 the Prims Minister statedthat he agreed generally, but added:   &quot;Ministers are entitledto keep all telegrams, minutes or documents circulated to theCabinet which they wrote and signed themselves..... These mustbe regarded as their personal property except that they willbe bound by the rules governing the use of official papers,which are well established.    To these should be added, inthe ease of the Prims Minister, correspondence with Headsof Governments..Ministers below Cabinet rank oast returnall their papers.&quot;The Treasury Solicitor confirmed thatthere was no difference between the documentsspecified by the Prime Minister and otherCabinet documents.

^Qoaaurg u the fiafcioit office, far rogoygrr6*   In 1935 the Cabinet (Cabinet 51(35)10) deoldedthat In 9 cases submitted them no further action should betaken towards recovery during life-time of thoee concerned,but that on their death their executors should be aeked toreturn the documents outstanding.    In a number of instancesthe documents were later returned in whole or part orrecovered from executors.    Outstanding pre-war oases and oasesarising in 1945 are noted above.ft   The practiee is that on the death of any of the Ministoreor ex-Ministers concerned the Secretary of the Cabinet, afteran appropriate Interval, writes a letter to the executorsseeking the return of documents outstanding.For the form of words used see, e.g*Pile 4/3/209 (letter of 17th November, 1948).It is usual for the Cabinet Office to offer assistancein Identifying documents and to arrange to collect them.They are thereafter checked and sorted and either returnedto the respective *skins&apos; or destroyed.     In many oases it isimpossible to be certain what documents are in fact outstandingsince the information on record is sometimes deficient.Detailed lists are, however, on record of the documenteretained by individual Ministers on the break-up of theCoalition and Caretaker Governments in 1945.The main file (4/3/8 Part 3) is brought forwardquarterly In the registry for scrutiny.    On the deathof any of the Ministers   or ex-Mlnisters concerned theappropriate individual file is brought forward.
DISPOSAL OF CABINBT DQOOMBMTa7o- After an interval the number of spare oopies ofCabinet documents Is reduced to a minimum, the balance beingdestroyed as &apos;secret waste&apos;.    Agenda, meeting notices andother ephemeral documents are destroyed by Departments butthe disposal of memoranda and minutes is ths responsibility ofthe Oabinet Office.    An exception to this is that, by specialarrangement, oopies of documents held in posts abroad andno longer required for current use are sometimes destroyedthere, a list of documents so destroyed being sent to theOabinet Office.In March, 1939 a oircular letter was sent toMinisters * Private Secretaries on the actionwhich they should take in the matter of Cabinetdocuments in the event of an emergency evacuationof offices in Whitehall.     This letter stressedthat the responsibility for the safe custodyof Cabinet documents in their position restedwith ths Departments.     It was suggested thatin the event of an emergency, current Cabinetpapsxs should be removed when ths Departmentwas evacuated.     Older documents should eitherbe left in strong rooius or safes, if thebuildings were still to be guarded day andnight, or, that failing, destroyed by fire, anote in general terms being kept of the documentsso destroyed.    It wae also stressed that in nocircumstances should any attempt be made in anemergency to return copiee of Cabinet papers to theCabinet Office.     Departments were asked to reducethe size of the problem by returning olderpapers periodically.    This circular letterwas re-ieeued in Way, 19U0.   (Pile U/3/19U, Parts1 and 2).
caafiagaUftl Mrsta and ^goprgs ^goUga7f.   Bound veUumss of all Gabinat and Cabinet Committeememoranda and minutes are kept in tbe Confidential Libraryin tbe charge of the Reoords Section, which is also responsiblefor maintaining sets of spare copies of documents.    Afteran interval the number of spare copies is reduced to a Mini raws.Documents recovered from ex-ministers are normallyrestored to skins or dostroyed unless their is a specialrequest for their separate preservation.In January, 1939, when alterations to thebasement of tho cabinet Office (in RichmondTerrace) made It temporarily Impossible tocontinue storing Cabinet documents there, itwas arranged that they should be transferred toa room in Scotland Yard.In January, 1939, la connection withemergency arrangements in the Cabinet Office,a proposal was approved by the Prime Ministerthat spares of all Cabinet records other thanthose required to be immediately available,should be sent for safe custody to tbe PublicRecord Office, and stored in Record Offloeaccommodation at Canterbury where they wouldnot be open to public inspection.    Thisarrangement was not in fact oarried out.(This proposal applied only to apares and therewas no Intention of handing over the confidentiallibrary copies of Cabinet documents to thePublic Record Office.) (File 4/3/132 * art 1).Negotiations subsequently took place,through tbe Office of Vorke, for theacquisition of storage accommodation atSlstree and large numbers of spare copiesof early documents and of registered fileswere removed there in April, 1939.    Laterdocuments were likewise transferred InMay, 1939.    In 1940 these reoords were movedto accommodation at ..oburn Abbey, Bedfordshirewhere certain branches of the Cabinet Officeworked during the war (the Country Headquarters&apos;)See generally File 4/3/132.In March 1942 the question of microfilmingCabinet conclusions was considered, but it wasdecided that this was unnecessary.    Pile4/3/198.
So decision has as yet been reached on the questionwhether at some stage Cabinet documents should be transferredto the Public record Office, and if so. whether they shouldbe opened to public inspection after a lapse of a specifiednumber of years.The first recorded oontact between the Public   eoordOffice and the Cabinet Office dates to April, 1918, when theWar Cabinet Offioe was asked whether it would approve Rulesfor the disposal of documents and participate in the drawingup of a schedule in terms of the Publlo record Offioe Acts,Eventually, on 15th July, 1918 Sir Maurice Hankey signedthe proposed; Rule (Pile I/F/315), which was subsequentlyapproved by order in Council and became S.R. and 0 1572 of1918.    Ho schedule was made under that Rule to regulate theweeding of documents for transfer to the Publlo Record Offioeand the Rule has therefore bad no effect.The question oame up indirectly in 1932 in relation tothe transfer to the Publlo Record Offioe of Departmental filescontaining Cabinet and C.I.D. documents and was discussedat an interdepartmental conference under Treasury Chairmanship.On 25th October, 1933* after prolonged consideration, agree-msnt was reached on a set of rules to be followed byDepartments In the filing of Cabinet and C.I.D. documents, butthese rules were never promulgated,The general question was further considered in 1947 inconsultation with the Deputy Keeper of Public records.See generally File k/2/Uk,A large collection of papere belonging toMr. Gladstone is preserved in the BrltiehMuseum.    This collection which is open topubllo inspeotlon contains large numbersof Cabinet memoranda and notea by Mr. Gladstone&apos; of Cabinet meetings over the period 1853 to1894.   See article in &apos;The Times * of 16th July,1949 (Pile IS/tit   ).
ACCS^o TO OABIHBT D0CUMSHT8Former Ministars of Cabinet rank may at any time bareaccess in the Cabinet Offlee to documents issued to themwhile they were in off ice,     (Where a Minister desires aooessonly to a single document or to a few documents it isusual on grounds of convenience, to send the document ordocuments to him,)This is the long-standing rule. Itwas specifically stated by the Cabinet in1936 (Cabinet 54(36)10).In recent times former ministers who havevisited the Cabinet Offioe to examine documentsissued to them when in office are Mr. Hore-BaMsha(File 28/2/112) and Lord remplewoed (File28/2/126).    It ia customary for rooms to bemade available temporarily for such Ministers.Exceptionally documents have been sent to,e.g* Mr. Churchill (File 28/2/79) andMr. Hore-Beliaha (File 28/2/112).For the form of words used in oases wheresingle documents are sent by request see,e.g. letter of 12th February, 1947 on Pile28/2/96 (Mr. H.d. Hudson).p4. The privilege of access to documents issued to themwhile in offioe is not regarded as applying to JuniorMinisters save in special circumstances.See File 4/3/38A (letter of 8th June, 1948).( In a latter of 15th August, 1946 (File 26VVBit was stated that the Cabinet Offioe &quot;would bediaposed to give ex-Parliamentary Secretariesfacilities to consult any Cabinet documentsrelating to work for whioh they were responsiblewhen they were in office.&quot;JThe right of access has normally been regarded asapplying to Departmental papers current at the time when aformer Minister waa ia Office, including drafts of CabinetSee File 4/3/3&amp;A (letter of 8th June, 1948).7f3 - So far as concerns the period before the War Cabinetof 1939-45 access by former Ministers is not in practicenear owl. confined to the documents actually issued to themwhile in offioet   they have access to the documents circulatedwhile the^f were in of ice.     The presumption is thata member of the Cabinet received, when in office, all thedocuments of the Cabinet of which he waa a member and, ifhe had so wished, could at the time have seen all subordinatedocuments.
On occasion a former Minister has asked to see adocument circulated when he wae not in faot a member ofthe Government,    Be has, however, ho right to eee sucha document.In December, X9U7 Mr, Churchillasked to see a memorandum circulated in 1935to Mr. Maodooaldfs National Oabinet (of whichhe was not a member).     The position wasexplained to him, but it was suggested thatit might be possible to let him have some ofthe factual information on which thememorandum was based.     Pile 28/2/79 Part 1.
9fflglftjj?7-       Per boob holding official positions under the Crownwould not normally be precluded from access in the CabinetOffice to documents whloh it was needs ear., for them to essfor official purposes, but eaoh application should beconsidered on its merits.     Ordinarily civil servantsrequiring to see particular documents for official purposeswould ess the copies held In their Departments, but requestsare sometimes received for access to specially secretdocuments not given a full circulation (e.g. ConfidentialAnnexes).There is an established procedure whereby officialhistorians and narrators (who have access to Cabinet memorandaand conclusions that they require) may also, with thepermission of the Secretary of the Oabinet, ese confidentialannexes.    See File 70/U.Unofficial fmoMThe standing rule is that unofficial persons are not givenaccess te Cabinet documentsf   exceptions are made only invery special circumstances.    The rule and exceptions to itwere laid down expressly by ths Cabinet on 17th October, 1J5U(Cabinet 35(3h)U) (on a request made by Lady Ji liner to seeCabinet documents which had belonged to Lord Mllner in orderto reply to criticism Of him made by Mr. Lloyd George)i-&quot;(1) Access by unofficial persons to Cabinet and othersimilar secret documents for the safe custody of whlohCabinet Offices are responsible, should not be givenwhere the object of the application is the productionof an ordinary historical, biographical or other eimilarwork.(2) In cases, however, where extracts have already beenpublished with authority, access to the documents may,subject to the conditions named in (3) below, be given toany person who has a good title to vindicate the memoryof a deceased person who claims that that memory hasbeen Injured by the publication in question.(3) The conditions to be satisfied in (2) above arei-(a) That the documents must contain nothing, thepublication of which would be prejudicial to the publicInterest.(b) That in such cases the proofs of any proposed to bepublished by the vindicator should be submitted to theCabinet Office for approval before publication](o) The sanction of the Prime Minister of the day aswell as ths Prime Minister in offioe when the documentswere actually produced and circulated must be obtainedbefore access by an unofficial person is given&quot;.&apos;There have since been certain further exceptions to thestanding rule.    See Part VIII,
The extent to which former Crown servants can be givenaccess to Cabinet documsnts has not been clearly destined.Strictly they are precluded from such access, but tbeapplication would be considered on its merits, hawingregard to (1) the nature of the documents in question. (11) theposition whloh the applicant formerly held, and (ill) thepubpose for whloh access was sought.    See cases noted inPart VIII,
0-     Since ton dootsmnts of one administration are domesticto it, a succeeding administration has no right of accessto them,    This is the traditional rule, out it isQualified in practice in two ways.    Firstly, accsss to tbedocuments of an earlier administration may be given with theconsent of tbe Prime Minister of that administration.Secondly on successive changes of Government since 1935 ithas been the general praotioe for Ministers demitting offioeto band over their documents to their successors so far as theywere required for current administration   (see p.    )and there has therefore been no general withdrawal on tberesignation of Governments.     (This may not, however, holdgood when the present Government goes out of offioe.)Again, in many instances Departmental files will containdocuments of an earlier administration.f(.       It is very seldom that proposals have been made that theadministration in offioe should be given access to the papersof a previous administration,    the only occasions before thewar of 1939-43 la which this was done, no political questionof any kind was involved; on grounds of convenience it wassometimes desirable, on some technical question, to lettbe administration in office see documents prepared for theguidance of the preceding administration, e.g. reports oftechnical or specialised committees.    -iven in these oasesit was the practice to obtain the consent of tbe Prime Ministerin offioe at the time when the documents were circulated.In other cases where it was suggested that tbe administrationIn offioe should be given access to the political papers oftheir predecessors it was suggested that if they pressed thematter they would be creating a precedent which might laterbe used against themselves. ?.        If the administration In offioe wish to see a documentof an earlier administration the strict rule is for them tosecure the consent of the Prims Minister of that administration,or, if he is deadf the leader of the party concerned.    Thisrule should certainly be complied with If the documentinvolved Is in any way of a political character, but if thedocument is essentially factual in nature (e. g* a report by anofficial Committee) it would probably not be necessary toobtain the consent of the earlier administration.In the past it was sometimes held that the Klng&apos;a consentshould be obtained before the documents of an earlieradministration were disclosed in this way.     It is possiblethat a oass might arias where the administration in offioeinsisted on seeing the papers of the previous administrationnotwithstanding that that administration objected.    In thesecircumstances it would probably be constitutionally necessaryfor the Prims Minister in offioe to recommend formally to theKing that the requisite permission should be granted, butwhether In such a ease the Prims Minister would ever thinkit desirable to make such a submission may wall be open toquestion.See generally Files 7/3/11 14/3/8 and 28/2.Particular instances arc noted in File7/3/1.In March, 1928 the Home Secretary askedto see all the Cabinet proceedings referring tothe  lnovleff letter.    He was given the
proceedings on this matter of Mr. Baldwin1 aCabinet but not those of Mr. Maedonald*e Cabinet.Among the latter waa a report of a CabinetCommittee dealing with the subject, the solecopy being preserved, under cover, in theSeoretaryTa standard Pile.     The Prime Ministerwas advised that he waa entitled to aee thisdocument and if he thought fit to ahow it to anyof his colleagues, but that he waa underobligation not to use or quote the documentwithout the consent of Mr. Macdonald.    ThePrims minister read the document but decidednot to make any uae of it.     See note, bySir M. hsnksy, of 16th a arch, 1928 at the endof volume XVII of the Cabinet Minutea.A new Minister taking charge of a Department hasaccess to all the Departmental files, including thosecontaining minutes bi hie Predecessor.     The need forcontinuity of administration ma&amp;ea this inevitable.     Ifa new Minister epecifioally called for an old file itoould not be withheld from him.    At the earns time whenofficials submit files in current action to a new Ministerat their initiative, they often refrain from sending forwardmaterial which it might be politically embarrassing fora new Minister to see.    vhe difficulty is often met bysubmitting s separate memorandum without attaching the file.A rule about the Govemratnt of the day not havingaccess to the Cabinet papers of an earlier Governmentof a different political complexion arose in the courseof the Foreign Affaire Debate on 26th February, 1952.No departure from the practice described aboveresulted but guidance was given to the Press toemphasise the distinction between the right of accessto the political and the executive papers of a previcuaAdjninistraticn.   A note on the point raised In thedebate and the ensuing act! n is on file 7/3/1.
The general rule le that there ie no publication ofCabinet documents as euoh or of extracts from them.     Therehave, however, been many instances where the text of suchdocuments or quotations from them have been reproduced in privatepublications, with or without authority.    There have also beenisolated eases where the text or substance of a Cabinetmemorandum has bean published officially..rUa.o i^bllcnUon,On the rules governing the r-production of and quotationfrom Cabinet documents in private publication see Part VIIIand the digest of cases there given.    Hotes are also giventhere of oases of publication by Commonwealth and otherGovernments of secret documents to whloh the United Kingdomwas a party.
There are no instances on record of the officialpublication in tho United Kingdom of Cabinet documents assuch, except In tho Official Histories of the   ar.     Publicationof documents in the Uiflolal Histories is governed broadlyby the same rules as are applied where consent ie sought toprivate publication.In a debate in the House of Lords on19th February, 1947 the oeoretary of State forDominion Affairs (Lord Addlson) quoted from aV/ar Cabinet memorandum (W. P. (45)36).     He didnot reveal the source of his quotation, butthe opposition pressed for the publication ofthe document.    ..fter discussion with theOpposition it was agreed that the text of.V.P. (45)36 should be published aa a -bite Paperwith a number of minor adjustments to removeany suggestion that it waa a Cabinet paper.File 28/2/96.Irakino May (pages 433-4) states that&quot;it has been admitted that a document whichhas boon cited ought to be laid upon the tableof the House, if it oan be dona with ut Injuryto the public interests&quot;.A memorandum by the Central Offioe ofInformation to Sub-Committec D of the selectCommittee on Estimatea quoted extracts from aCabinet paper (CP. (46)54) and a Cabinetooncluslon (CM. (46) 17th Conclusions).     Thismemorandum, which cited the extracts with theirreference symbols, waa published in March, 1948in the report of the ^ub-Commit tee.    There was,however, no subsequent request for the publicationof the documents quoted.     Pile 32/68.In February, 1946, the British *rosecutorat the War Criminals Tribunal at huremburg askedfor permission to produce documents as evidenceto refute Gorman chargee alleging that theFrench and British had intended to Invade Norwayand the allegation that the Gorman invasionwas a defensive measure to forestall this event.The documents concerned included Foreign Officetelegrams and Cabinet papers. In a minute of29th larch, 1946 the Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee)said that he thought that Attorney Generalshould be able to deal with the matter withoutproducing documents and that he considered thatto present Cabinet minutes as documentaryevidence would make a most undesirableprecedent.

it.       In 1938 arrangementi were made for the maintenanceof a central index covering Cabinet Committee and C.I.D.proceedings.     (The Cabinet minutes continued to beIndexed separately.)     This central index system was con-tinued during the early years of the war. under the chargeof an Indexing Section stationed at the Country Headquarters.In January. 1943* however, the central index wae abandoned andthe clerical sections wsro made responsible, under supervisionof Assistant Secretaries, for the preparation of Indexes forthe Coixiitteei with which they were concerned (eee O.M.

Indexesare also prepared for certain other ImportantCommittees but are not printed or, In general, circulated out-side the C binet Office.    The basis on which Indexes arecompiled is governed by the guidance contained in theOffioe Notice of 1943 (l*s. they are based for the mootpart on minutes), but practice varies in accordance withthe requirements of particular Committees.See generally File 4/2/17, Parts 1-4.
