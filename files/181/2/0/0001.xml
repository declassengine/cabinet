The Cabinet Is an informal meeting of &quot;each of Hie-iajesty&apos;s Confidential Servants as are of the PrivyCouncil&quot; (Johnson).    Until the ministers of the CrownAct, 1937 (which, among other things, makes provision forthe payment of additional salary to certain Ministers whenthey are members of the Cabinet) the existence of theCabinet had not been recognised in any statute:   itsexistence depends on a convention of the constitution.Its origin   as an informal gathering 1b reflected in itsorganisation and procedure;   and, although in the lastthirty or forty years a more formal system hasdeveloped, practice and procedure have varied considerablyto suit particular circumstances and particular PrimeMinisters.The Cabinet has no statutory powers or functions,but consisting of the leading Members of the dominantParty in the House of Commons it is the directing bodyof national policy.    In relation to Parliamentit provides a means of reconciling the principles ofMinisterial responsibility and collective responsibility,under which every Minister in charge of a Department isresponsible to Parliament for a particular sphere of activityand yet shares with his colleagues collectiveresponsibility for the Government&apos;s policy as a whole.On the development of Cabinet Governmentthe constitutional relationship between theKing and the Cabinet and between the Cabinetand Parliament, and the formation ofCabinets, reference should made to the standardauthorities, e.g. Jennings;   and Anson,Vol. 11(1), pp. 108-148.For a short reference liet of books, etcabout the Cabinet and the Cabinet system seePart VII(5) Annex I.For a brief note on Cabinet Governmentin the United Kingdom see Part VII(5) Annex III.
The general doctrine is conveniently stated lathewords used by Lord Salisbury in 1878:&quot;For all that passes la Cabinet each member of it whodoee not resign Is absolutely and irretrievably responsible,and has no right afterwards to say that he agreed in oneease to compromise, while in another he was persuaded byhis colleagues.......It is only on the principle thatabsolute responsibility is undertaken by every member ofthe Cabinet who, after a decision is ar lived at, remainsa member of it, that the joint responsibility of Ministersto Parliament can be upheld, and one of the meet essentialprinciples of parliamentary responsibility established&quot;.Ministers of Cabinet Rank who are not members of theCabinet share in the collective responsibility for theCabinet*s decisions.     Collective responsibility ispreserved in three ways:-(a) The minutes and (with some exceptions) thememoranda of the Cabinet are circulated to all Ministersof Cabinet Rank;   and any Minister of Cabinet Rank has aright to submit suggestions to the Cabinet on any matter.(b) A Minister who is not a member of the Cabinet ieinvariably summoned to attend Cabinet when questionsaffecting his Departmental interests are to be discussed.(c) Ministers who are not members of the Cabinet playan important part in the work of Cabinet Comudttees,through which they make their contribution towards theformulation of Government policy.See Jennings, PP. 217-227;   Anson, Tol HQ),pp. 117-119, 144.On the term &quot;Ministers of Cabinet Rank&quot;see para. 7 below.For general discussion of the doctrineof collective responsibility and the applicationof the doctrine during the period of theWar Cabinet in the First and Second World Warssee M.G.

0     3 Membership of the Cabinet is not in itself an office,but members are all Ministers of the Grown and PrivyCouncillors.Sec Jennings, pp. 61-64 and Aaaon,Vol. 11(1) pp. 111-2, 224.In the oecond ..orld .ur, Lord Halifax,(his Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington)attended meetings of the .ar Cabinet, as afull member, when in London.   He was of course)a Privy Councillor.   See minute of28th November, 1941 on File 48/4/1 Part 1;Hansard, House of Cossaone, 27th November, 1941Cols. 890-1.if The Prime Minister makes Ministers members of the Cabinetbjr informal Invitation and can equally informally requestthem to leave the Cabinet.    In practice changes in themembership of the Cabinet within the lifetime of a singleGovernment are frequently associated with changes in officeto avoid a situation where a Minister may leave the Cabinetwhile retaining his office.In November, 1942, when Sir Stafford Crippsceased to be Lord Privy Seal and became Ministerof Aircraft Production, he left the .ar Cabinet.In May, 1940, Lord Simon, on relinquishingoffice ae Chancellor of the Exchequer to becomeLord Chancellor, left the (far Cabinet. InOctober, 1947, Mr. Shinwell, on relinquishingoffice as Minister of Fuel and Power to becomesecretary of State for War, left the Cabinet.On the other hand in February. 1942, Sir KingeleyWood left the War Cabinet although remainingChancellor of the Sxehequer;   and in 1946, onthe appointment of a Minister of Defence, theService Ministers left the Cabinet.
The composition of the Cabinet is determined by thePrime Minister, who is guided partly by tradition and partlyby political considerations and the personality of hiscolleagues.Por the composition of Cabinets since 1916see Annex 1*oee Jennings pp. 62-63;   , neon, pp. 111-2;22kjr   and. for details of membership, etc.Pile 1+/1/3.Before 1916 the Cabinet usually includedall Ministers of the Crown.    On 9th December,1916, the Cabinet was replaced by a .ar Cabinet.This was composed of the members of theWar Committee of the Cabinet which was set up *earlier in the war and consisted of fireMinisters, none of whom, except the Chancellorof the -Exchequer, was a Departmental Minister.In 1919 the full Cabinet was re-introduced.The number of Departmental Ministers had mean-while increased, and Cabinets between 1919 and1939 contained usually twenty members, theremaining Ministers sharing the collectiveresponsibility of the Cabinet but not sitting InCabinet.In the financial crisis in 1931 a RationalCabinet was set up of only nine Ministersbesides the Prims Minister.    This Cabinet,which first met on 26th --ugust, 1931, held 2kmeetings, and remained in office until theformation of the second National Cabinet onIGth November, 1931*At the outbreak of war in September, 1939a .Var Cabinet of nine members was formed;   inMay, 1940 when Mr. Churchill became PrimeMinister of a Coalition Government, the WarCabinet was reformed with five msmhwrs;   butite composition was later modified from timeto time.    See Annex 1*On 25th May, 1945 when Labour a nd Liberalsrs left Mr. Churchill&apos;s Government, aCabinet was formed of fifteen members besidesthe Prime Minister.Mr. Attlee&apos;s Labour Cabinet when formedin  ugust, 19U5 consisted of twenty Ministers.In 19h8 the number went down to 16, untilMr. Dalton returned to of ice as Chancellor ofthe Duchy of Lancaster.Por discussion of the general problem   of &amp;size and composition of the Cabinet eee Reportof the Machinery of Government Committee (Cad 9230of 1918) pp. 4-6; notes by the Secretary of theCabinet on an article by Lord Samuel inPile 28/2/97; and G.Q.C.

tj. Xt has bean usual for Cabinets to include one or moreMinisters without heavy Departmental duties, e.g. the LordPresident of the Council and the Lord Privy Seal;   and fromtime to time Ministers without Portfolio have been appointed.These Ministers may be assigned specific tasks ss the needarises, or they may be gives a general co-ordinating functionover a particular field of administration;   they arefrequently appointed Chairmen of Cabinet Committees.   Ministerscharged with co-ordinating functions do not, however, fulfilany supervisory role on the lines advocated, for example, inthe report of Machinery of Government Committee in 1918(Cmd. 9230);   and the Departmental Ministers remain responsiblefor the policy and administration of their Departments.   Xaa note circulated in October, 1947 (CP.(47)288) the PrimeMinister outlined the duties of the Ministers with co-ordinating functions then in office, i.e. the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, the Minister for Keonoizde affairs, the Ministerof Defence aud the Lord Privy ueal.   In November, 1947 whenSir Stafford Grippe succeeded Mr. Dalton as Chancellor ofthe Exchequer he retained the functions assigned to him whileMinister for Economic Affairs.r

%       g- While the Lord Chancellor la regarded as the principaladviser to the Cabinet on legal matters, ons of the LavA Officers is now normally asked to attend the Cabinet when\ legal or constitutional issues are under discussion.

The general role of the Law orricera wasrestated by the Prime Minister in CP. (48) 271, the substanceof which is embodied in paragraphs 6 and 28 of CP. (1+9)95*CP.(1*8)271 (16th Movember, 191*8) stated:-&quot;It Is very desirable that we should makefull use of ths experience of the LawOfficers on the legal aspects of policy questions]I have not here la mind the long-establishedand valuable practice of referring difficultlegal issues to the Law Officers for a formalOpinion, but rather the general assistancewhich they can give to their Ministerialcolleagues on ths legal questions which arisein the formulation and administration of policy.&quot;I hope, therefore, that Ministers incharge of Departments will set hesitate to consultjths Law Officers, as colleagues in theGovernment, on questions where their advice islikely to be of value.&quot;Chairmen of Cabinet Committees shouldalso bear in raind the value of securing theattendance of one of the Law Officers at anymeeting at which legal iasues are likely toarise.1&quot;On ths position of the Scottish LawOfficers, who have sometimes in the past beenappointed on a non-political basis, seeMo. 10, Downing Street Handbook, p. 19.In April, 192k ths Attorney-Generalsubmitted a memorandum (CP.251(24) Annex III)pointing out that &quot;in important matters itgenerally happens that the Law Officers haveno knowledge whatever of the policy to beadopted by the Cabinet, end 5n consequence arequite unable to express an opinion as to whetherthat policy can be legally carried into effect.&quot;Ministers were asked (Cab.27(24)4) to ensurethat the Law Officers saw Bills as early aspossible.   The Law Officers were also, ifnecessary, to be called to the Cabinet.   Itwas partly as a result of this discussion thatthe Treasury Minute of 28th April, 1921* on thssubmission of business to the Cabinet wasissued (sss below).
In 1944 the Treasury Solicitor, enbeing consulted by the Secretary of theCabinet, held that since the Lord Chancellorems the principal adviser to the Cabinet onlegal matters, the Lav Officers should attendonly when he so required them, s*g* in a easewhere it sm% contemplated that an action mighthave to be takes and a decision defended inthe courts.   File.

Although the burden ofwork now Imposed upon the Lew Officers issubstantially heavier than hitherto,   1 under-stand that a Law Officer has been present on alloccasions where the Minister in charge of theBill concerned has indicated that their attendancein connection with particular clauses might beof aaslstance to the Committee.

In 1944 the freasury Solicitor, onbeing consulted by the secretary of theAt the Cabinet&apos;s aeeting on 6th April(CM.(50) 19th Conclusions, Minute 2), the LordChancellor complained that he had not been consultedpersonally about the legal issues involved in aquestion then before the Cabinet, although theAttorney-General had been consulted and had indeedgiven a formal Opinion.   Subsequently the priseMinister informed the Lord Chancellor that he did notthink it would be right to ask Departmental Ministersto decide when they should consult him and when theyshould consult the Law Officers;   end teat it was theduty of the Law Officers to bring the Lord Chancellorin en any matter an which they had given an Opinionif it seemed likely to oome before the Cabinet.The Attorney-General agreed on this occasion to giveinstructions that, when a written Opinion was givenby a Law Officer on any matter of general interestor importance, a oopy should be sent to the LordChancellor, so as to enable him, if he wished, todiscuss the matter with the Attorney before thequestion came before the Cabinet.

It 1b the duty of the Attorney-General,when a prosecution proposed is of such a character as toinvolve matters of public policy, to inform himself of theviews of the appropriate Minister (usually the HomeSecretary) before coming to a decision, but the responsibilityfor the eventual decision remains exclusively that of theAttorney-General.     The question of prosecution wouldnot normally come before the Cabinet, which has no rightto influence the Attorney-General in his decision.See CP. 544 (24) (File L.Q./3/2) andJennings, p. 181.    For instances where thequestion of prosecution has come before theCabinet see File E.0./S/1.     The classicinstance was the Campbell case in 1924 when,after discussion in Cabinet (Cab.48(24)5),a prosecution of the acting editor of theDaily barker under the Incitement toMutiny   Act was withdrawn.     This led to avote or censure in the House of Commonson which the First labour Government waedefeated on Sth October, 1924.    Apart fromthe suspicion that the prosecution had beenwithdrawn on purely political grounds theCabinet was open to criticism in deciding thatin future &quot;no public proeeoution of a politicalcharacter should be undertaken without theprior sanction of the Cabinet being obtained.&quot;This decision wae revoked by Mr. Baldwin*sCabinet (Cab.65(24)8).   Gee Files noted aboveand Home Office File 477, 583/1.It has sometimes been argued that becauseof his quasi-Judicial functions the Attorney-General jugfct never to be a swaber of theCabinet,      here have, hoverer, been severalCabinets in which he has been included.See Jennings, p. 63;   Anson, Vol. II(1), p. 221.
junior malaVrriJunior Ministers (i.e. Parliauentari Under-Secretariesof State and Parliamentary secretaries) have dj standing inrelation to toe Oabiaet, oat they may bo asked to attendin certain circumstances,     -he Parliamentary secretaryto the Treasury, as Chief Whip, normally attends fordiscussion of Parliamentary business.On the attendance of Junior Ministoreat Cabinet see para. 15.On the general position of JuniorMinisters see Part XX, para. 28.The Financial oecretary to the Treasuryvan a member of Mr. Baldwin&apos;s Cabinet in1923-1921*.i 3 The Prime Minister determines the precedence of membersof the Cabinet and other senior ministers;   he is guidedpartly by tradition and partly by political and personalconsiderations.    Cabinet precedence differs from precedenceIn the Privy Council and in public ceremonial generally, wheree.g. the Lord Chancellor takes precedence over the PrimeMinister.On the appointment of a new member of the Cabinet or anew Minister the secretary of the Cabinet takes the PrimeMinister*s instructions on the precedence to be given to him.This is usually done through the Prime Minister*s   PrivateSecretary.     Thereafter the Cabinet office list of Ministersis revised as necessary, e.g. for guidance in the preparationof front pages of minutes.     Copies of the list are regularlysent by the Chief Clerk to the Editors of the Stationeryoffice list, Hansard and Vaooer&apos;e Parliamentary Companion.See generally File Vl/11.Certain offices, including those of LordChancellor and i*ord Privy seal, normally carryhigh precedence.     In 19h7, however, whenLord Iranan was made a member of the Cabineton appointment as Lord Privy Seal the PrimeMinister ruled that he should rank below allother Members of the Cabinet.     (*VhenMr. Tost tjohneton was Lord Privy deal in thesecond Labour Cabinet he ranked after all othermembers;   and in the second Rational Cabinet(formed 10th November, 1931) Mr. d now dan(Lord Privy seal) did not rank higher than f if-teenth).

Cabloot meetings take precedeace over other meetingsand Departmental business.    Members of the Cabinet alwaysattend  unless they are indisposed or out of London.    TheCabinet has no &apos;quorm&amp;*;   at certain special or emergencymeetings, particularly meetings during * holiday * periods,attendance has been quite email.     (See, e.g*, CM. 72(47);73(47); 52(49)).Ministers not in the Cabinet attend on invitation;   theyare normally Invited for items of busines affecting theirDepartments, but the Prime Minister*s Instructions are takenwhen the Agenda for a particular meeting is submitted to him.Tfa9 9\UPireat notes gB procedure etate:-It is of assistance to the Secretary if PrivateSecretaries indicate, when asking for a subject to beplaced on the Agenda, which Ministers, other than membersof the Cabinet, are likely to be affected, so thatarrangements may, if necessary, be made for their attendance.Ministers summoned to meetings of the Cabinet forparticular items will receive an Agenda Paper on which anapproximate time will be set against each item.     Everyendeavour Is made not to keep Ministers waiting, but the timeat which each item will be reached cannot be forecast exactly.Cabinet meetings take precedence over other business.   Theutmost endeavours should be made by Ministers to be punctualand thus avoid wasting the time of their colleagues.If a member of the Cabinet, or a Minister summoned for aparticular item, is unable, for any reason, to be presentat a meeting of the Cabinet, he should notify the Secretary,who will inform the Prime Minister and will also considerwhether any rearrangement of business is required.(CP. (hi) 95, paragraphs 14, 15 and 17)Prom October, 1946 until October, 1947(when the Government was reconstituted)Mr. John Strachey, Minister of Pood, was,at the Prims Minister*s request, regarded asa &quot;constant attender&quot; on the analogy of WarCabinet practice, and although not a memberof the Cabinet attended regularlyirrespective of the business to be takenincluding, e.g. the Budget discussion.He was listed on the Agenda as an &quot;invitee&quot;.Pile 4/1/31.On the attendance of the Law Officerseee para. 8.The Service Ministers are normallyinvited to attend when matters affectingthe administration of the three services arediscussed.   They do not ordinarily attendwhen strategic questions are discussed.
Ho one can represent a Minister in his capacity of amember of the Cabinet.    A representative is therefore onlyrequired if a Ministers Department is concerned with aparticular item.    In such eases the Minister is normallyrepresented by bis Parliamentary Secretary.     In September1945, however, the Prims Minister ruled that Parliamentaryoecretaries should not represent their Ministers atCabinet when broad issues of policy are being discussed,even though the interests of their Departments may beinvolved: they should only attend where there le a purelyDepartmental view to be put.     (He also ruled that officialsshould not attend In the absence of their Ministers except invery special circumstances.)    (see Pile 4/1/31) *On the position of Junior Ministersgenerally, see Part II.In 1947, when the parliamentary Secretary,ee the   inlstry of Fuel and Power (Mr. Gal take 11)was chairman of the Materials Committee, theSecretary of the Cabinet had discretion fromthe Prime Minister to arrange for him to beinvited to Meetings of the Cabinet whenmatters of concern to him in that capacitywere discussed.    File 4/1/31*
The Chiefs of Staff nay he Invited to attend fardiscussion of military matters or strategic issues.   ThePrime Minister&apos;a instructions are taken;   normally, exceptin clear cases, it is found expedient to consult informallythe Minister of Defence and, on occasion the ForeignSecretary, before a submission is mads.   Individual Chiefsof Staff may. if necessary, be represented by deputies.On occasion the Chiefs of Staff, although asked to be presentmar not be required to remain throughout the Cabinet&apos;sdiscussion;   on a few occasions they have been asked toattend at 10, Downing street, is ease their presence in theCabinet Room should bs required.
% The general role Is that, apart from members of thesecretariat, officials do not attend Cabinet.    There arehowever, two accepted departures from this rule:   the*^ Permanent Secretary to the Treasury and the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs may, with thePrims Minister*e consent, attend.    Their names are notshown on the Ajsada ss &quot;invitees&quot;.See generally Pile Vl/Jl.Notwithstanding the general rule otherofficials have, on occasion, in very exceptionalcircumstances been present.    Thus in 1946Foreign office officials other than thePermanent Under-secretary of State attended onthree occasions, and in 1948 on 6 occasions.Treasury officials other than the PermanentSecretary attended on 4 occasions and aMinistry of Defence official once, in 1946.A representative of Parliamentary Counselattended once in 1948.Others who attended, since the presentGovernment was formed are:-Chief Secretary for Palestine(Sir John Shaw) CM.75(46)High Commissioner for Palestine(Sir Alan Cunningham) CM. 33 (47)General Officer Commending Palestine(Lt.-Gen.

In 1939 meetings were occasionallyattended by the Permanent Secretaries and theParliamentary Secretaries of the Foreign Officeand the Treasury.War Cabinet On the establishment of the War Cabinet1,939-1945        more latitude was allowed.    Ministers not inthe War Cabinet attended when a subject withwhich they were Department ally concerned wasunder discussion;   the Chiefs of Staff attendedregularly at first and, from 1940 onwards, atthe weekly meetings at which the war situationwas reviewed.

It Is usual for a member of the Cabinet unable to bepresent to take steps to obtain the Prims Minister*s leersto be absent.    Thin is usually done by the Minister himself,directly or through his Private Secretary, the Secretaryof the Cabinet being kept informed.     (CP. (1.9)95, paragraph 17).2 i       The current notes on procedure state: -The Secretary should also be informed of Ministers *out-of-town engagements, and also of their week-end andholiday arrangements, in order that, if so**e sudden emergencyarises, he may be in a position to inform the Prime Ministerat once which ministers are Immediately available.(CP. (49)95, paragraphs 14-18)2very Friday a note is sent to the Prims Minister&apos;ePrivate Secretary showing the movements of Ministers overthe following week-end.    Detailed lists of addresses andtelephone numbers are prepared in advance of the *holiday *periods (Master, &quot;hitsun, the Summer Recess, and Christmas) foruse in ths Cabinet Offloe and 10, Downing Street.     Specialsteps are sometimes necessary to avoid the absence of too   manyMinisters at any one time during the summer recess.     In JunePrivate Secretaries are asked to indicate their Ministersholiday plans and a provisional list of holiday arrangementsis submitted to the   Prime Minister so that, before plans
become firm, any necessary adjustments can be carried out.Details of firm plans are obtained in July and consolidatedlists prepared.See generally File 32/136.The practice of noting week-end addressesdates from July, 1928fCab. 39(28)7).In the past arrangements to be made duringParliamentary Recess hare frequently beenconsidered at meetings of the Cabinet.In 1947, it was found shortly before theSummer Recess that an insufficient number ofsenior Ministers would be in or near Londonduring the month of August and one or twoMinisters had to be asked by the Prime Ministerto change their plans at short notice.In 1946, at the submission of the Secretaryof the Cabinet, the Prime Minister mentioned attCabinet meeting in June the need for eo-ordina**ion of holiday plans and asked ministers toInform the Secretary of their intentions.(CM.35(48)2).On the despatch of business during holidayperiods, see p.   53
Scope of Business22. The Cabinet has no terms of reference.    In the report of theHaldane Committee on the Machinery of Government (Cmd. 9230 of 1918)its main functions were described as follows:-(a) the final determination of the policy to be submitted to3ar liament;(b) the supreme control of the national executive in accordancewith the policy prescribed by Parliament;   and(c) the continuous co-ordination and delimitation of the authorityof the several Departments of State.23. There are, however, certain matters which are not regarded asappropriate for collective decision;  and by custom these are not normallydiscussed in Cabinet.     Lord Oxford and Asquith said that these included&quot;the exercise of the prerogative of mercy, the personnel of the Cabinetand the making of appointments&quot;  (Jennings, page 179);  and Jenningshimself adds the Budget, the exercise of the prerogative of dissolvingParliament and, possibly, public prosecutions.(i)     Personnel of the Cabinet.     This is hardly an example of anexcluded subject;   for it is difficult to imagine circumstances in which aCabinet could usefully discuss its own composition or its members.The composition of the Cabinet - both its size and the individuals whoshould compose it - is essentially a matter for the personal decision ofthe Prime Minister himself.     He first forms it;   and, if changes arerequired, he must make them.    No one could suppose that this could beCabinet business.     Gladstone is reported to have said in 1882, in aletter to a friend:-   &quot;I can affirm with confidence that the notion of atitle in the Cabinet to be consulted on the succession to a Cabinet officeis absurd.     It is a title which Cabinet Ministers do not possess.During thirty eight years since I first entered the Cabinet, I have neverknown more than a friendly announcement before publicity and very partialconsultation perhaps with one or two, especially the leaders in the SecondHouse.&quot;    (Morley&apos;s &quot;Life of Gladstone&quot;, Volume III, page 131).(ii)     Making of appointments.    Appointments are normally made bythe decision of the Prime Minister or of the Minister having power tomake the appointment.     But, where political considerations are involved,the responsible Minister may mention the person whom he has in mind tohis colleagues in Cabinet and give them the opportunity of expressingtheir views on the political considerations.     The responsible Ministeris normally left to take his final decision in the light of that expressionof views.     The Minister would not normally put his proposals to theCabinet in a formal memorandum inviting their approval.    Nor would itbe usual for the Cabinet formally to record a collective decision infavour of a particular appointment.     In the case of appointments of thehighest importance    e. g. before India attained independence, theappointment of a Viceroy - the Prime Minister would often inform theCabinet in advance, as a matter of courtesy, of the advice which he wasproposing to tender to the King.
(iii)     Prerogative of iNAercy.   The Home Secretary&apos;s responsibilityfor advising His K/.ajesty on the exercise of the prerogative of mercyis a purely personal jurisdiction.    It is accepted that the final advicemust be decided by the personal judgment of a single individual, afterweighing all the considerations to be taken into account.    Althoughthese considerations will often include some to which the courts couldnot have regard, the function is in essence judicial.    Exceptionally,however, cases arise into which important political considerationsenter;   and on these occasions the Home Secretary may wish to havesome discussion with his Cabinet colleagues.     Thus, when Roger Casementwas sentenced to death for treason in 1916, the Home Secretary consultedthe Cabinet on the question whether it would be politically expedient toadvise a reprieve for the purpose of placating public opinion in Irelandand the United States.    He circulated to the Cabinet memoranda by hisofficial advisers, who were strongly in favour of allowing the law to takeits course, and some of the representations received from private personsurging clemency.     The Cabinet considered this case at two meetings;and on each occasion expressed the view that there should be no reprieve(Home Office file 311,643/171).    Similarly, in February, 1940, the WarCabinet discussed the case of two members of the Irish Republican Armywho had left a bomb in the carrier of a tradesman&apos;s cycle in a Coventrystreet and had been convicted of the murder of the persons killed by itsexplosion.    This came before the Cabinet at the instance of the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs, who believed that the execution of these menwould provoke feelings of hostility in Eire and impair our war effort.These issues were discussed at four meetings of the War Cabinet:  butthe Home Secretary (Sir John Anderson) insisted that the final decisionmust remain with him and that the proper limits of a Cabinet discussionon such a question should be clearly understood.     While it was right thathe should have the assistance of his Cabinet colleagues in assessing whatweight should be given to the political considerations involved - and, inparticular, that he should hear the views of the Foreign Secretary and theDominions Secretary on the probable reaction of oublic   opinion in theUnited States and Eire respectively - the Home Secretary must himselfdecide, after hearing the views of his colleagues and weighing all theconsiderations which he must take into account, whether or not he shouldadvise the exercise of clemency.     On that occasion opinions in the WarCabinet were divided;   and, although various Ministers supported the pleaof the Dominions Secretary that the prisoners should be reprieved inorder to placate opinion in Eire, the Home Secretary decided that it washis duty to allow the law to take its course.     The prisoners wereexecuted;  and the political consequences feared by some members ofthe War Cabinet did not in fact follow.No reference to these discussions was included in the WarCabinet iv/inutes.    A full record was made of them, however, and twocopies of this have been preserved - one in the Home Office file827,810/61 and the other in Sir Edward Bridges&apos; collection ofconfidential War Cabinet records.(iv)     Public Prosecutions.     It is the personal responsibility of theAttorney-General to decide whether a public prosecution should beinstituted;  and he must be careful to avoid any suspicion of havingallowed his judgment to be influenced by political considerations.There may, however, be occasions on which such orosecutions involvequestions of public policy.     These are not limited to prosecutions forpolitical offences, such as sedition:   they may also arise in connectionwith the prosecution of the instigators of an illegal strike.    On suchoccasions it is proper for the Attorney-General to ascertain the views of
the Cabinet on the question whether the institution of proceedings wouldbe contrary to the public interest.    Even then, however, it is probablysafer that the Cabinet should not purport to direct the Attorney eitherto prosecute or to refrain from prosecuting.     It is better that, havingexpressed their views of the considerations of public policy whicharise, they should leave him free in form to talce his own decisionwhetner to prosecute or not.    The withdrawal, after Cabinet interven-tion, of a prosecution instituted by the Attorney-General led directlyto the defeat of the Government in 1924 (Jennings, pages lol-2).(v)     Dissolution of Parliament.    Jennings states that, since theend of the first war, the Cabinet has never discussed the exercise of theprerogative of dissolving Parliament (page 183), though he adds that ifthe .?rime iv inister desires the advice of the Cabinet there is nothingto prevent him from raising the question.Questions relating to the Dissolution of Parliament were in factdiscussed on several occasions by kr. Attlee&apos;s Cabinet in 1949/53.Thus -(a)     Before their formal meeting on 13th October, 1949, the membersof the Cabinet together with the Chief Whip met to consider whether aGeneral  lection should be held in the autumn of that year or postponeduntil 1953 (the Governments term of office was due to end in July, 195),at latest).    No Secretary was present, and it was decided that noreference to the discussion should be included in the Cabinet Conclu-sions, on the ground that it was concerned with Party, and not Cabinet,business.    \L n the front page of the Conclusions the meeting was recordedas having begun at 12 noon, which was the time when the Secretary wasadmitted and the formal meeting began.A &quot;No Circulation Record&quot; (see Part IV) was, however, madeto indicate that the discussion on the Election had ta^en place.     In thiswas reproduced the text of the communique issued to the Press afterthe meeting, which was as follows:-&quot;Having regard to the disturbing effects on trade and industryand on the national effort by the continuance of sneculationsas to an early General Election, the Prime lv.inister thinksit right to inform the country of his decision not to adviseHis JV.ajesty to dissolve Parliament this year. &quot;(b)    The Cabinet met on 13th January, 195?, to hear from the PrimeIv-inister that he had advised the King to dissolve Parliament with a viewto the holding of a General Election on 23rd February.    No Secretaryattended, but a set of  Conclusions was circulated consisting of a FrontPage and the following Jv.inute:-nce&quot;THE FRIJvJL   MINISTER informed the Cabinet of the advi.which he had tendered to The King about the dissolution ofthe oresent Parliament and the calling of a new Parliament,which advice His Vajesty had been pleased to accept. &quot;i meeting notice, but no agenda, had been circulated in advanceof the meeting.
(c)    The General Election of 1950 left lv-r. Attlee&apos;s Governmentwith a majority in the House of Commons of only 6;  and the Conser-vative Opposition at once challenged the Government during the Debateon the Address by pressing two amendments to a division.     On 9thKaarch, when the first of these divisions was to take place, the PrimeV.inister discussed with the Cabinet whether he should ask for adissolution if the Government were defeated on this division.     TheCabinefs discussion on this point was not recorded in the iVdnutes -which stated merely that &quot;The Cabinet had some preliminary dis-cussion about the situation which would arise if the Government weredefeated in a division early in the life-time of the Parliament&quot;.    A&quot;No Circulation Record&quot; of the discussion was, however, made;   andcopies of this were sent to the King&apos;s Private Secretary and to the PrimeIvdnister&apos;s Private Secretary, for their personal information.(vi)     The Budget.     The Chancellor of the Exchequer explains hisEudget prooosals to the Cabinet orally at a special meeting usually heldon the day before he opens his Budget in the House of Commons.     Bythen it is too late for him to make any substantial changes in his plans;and any consultations which he may wish to have with other    inistershave been carried out informally beforehand.     Thus, the Budget is nottreated as collective business.     Jennings is right in giving, as thereason for this procedure, the fundamental importance of secrecy(pages 1C2 - 1&amp;3);  but he has not realised the special need for secrecyabout the details of Budget proposals - viz. the danger that any leakagemight be made the basis of speculation on the Stock Exchange.     Thefact that this actually occurred in 1936, as a result of an indiscretion bylv..r. J.H. Thomas, is likely to be a conclusive answer for many years tocome to any suggestion that the details of the Budget should beformulated through normal Cabinet discussions.The Budget Cabinet is held as near to the Budget Speech aspracticable - usually on the day before, and preferably in the afternoonor evening.     The dates in recent years are:-	CABINET			BUDGET1945	:     22nd October    (a, m		)	23rd October1946	8th  April        (a.	m.	)	9th April1947	14th  April        (p.	m.	)	15th April1947	11th  November (a.	m.	)	12th  November1948	5th  April        (a.	m.	)	6th  April1949:	5th   Anril        (a.	m.	)	6th  AorilOn occasions - e. g. Civ..(47) 3oth Conclusions and (47) 86th Conclusions -other business has been taken at the same meeting, but efforts are alwaysmade to avoid this.In 1917 the Cabinet minutes recorded the Budget discussion insome detail, but since then details have never been recorded.     Thetoken minute reads:&quot;The Chancellor of the Exchequer communicated to theCabinet particulars of the proposals in the forthcomingBudget.In accordance with precedent, details are not recordedin the Cabinet Conclusions. &quot;
In 1950 the suggestion was made that the Cabinet should havesome discussion about the general principles of the Budget before theChancellor of the Exchequer formulated its details.     This suggestionwas justified on the ground of the Governments difficult Parliamentarysituation - they had a majority in the House of Commons of only sixover all other Parties - and the need to avoid a controversial Budget.But, although this was the occasion for making it, the suggestionundoubtedly reflected a growing feeling among Ministers that theBudget was becoming one of the main instruments of economic policyand it was unreasonable that this should be the one aspect of economicplanning on which no opportunity was given for the collective formula-tion of policy.     The Cabinet therefore devoted the greater part of onemeeting to a general discussion of the economic situation in relation tothe Budget:   (CM.(50) ?th Conclusions).    The Chancellor made an oralreport on the economic and financial situation and the main factors whichhe wpuld have to take into account in framing his Budget proposals;  andthe other members of the Cabinet took this opportunity of making specificsuggestions to him and expressing their views about the broad lineswhich the Budget might follow.     They intended to resume this discussionduring the following week;   but in the event they found it inconvenient todo this and agreed, instead, that Ministers who had specific suggestionsto make should send them in writing to the Chancellor (CM.(50) 9thConclusions, Minute 5).     One of these raised the question whether itwas right to continue to aim at a substantial Budget surplus;   and thePrime Minister asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer to circulate apaper on this question as a basis for discussion at a further meeting ofthe Cabinet.    The Cabinet met for this purpose on l&quot;th March and,after a full discussion, endorsed the general policy outlined in theChancellor&apos;s memorandum, and his approach to the problems of theforthcoming Budget (CM.(50) 12th Conclusions).None of these discussions was recorded in the Cabinet Minutes.It was the general view of Vinisters that this experiment had beenvaluable, since it had enabled the Cabinet to discuss the generalprinciples of Budgetary policy, while leaving the Chancellor to formulatethe details of his Budget in the light of the views expressed by hiscolleagues.It is perhaps possible to deduce a general principle governingthis exclusion of certain subjects from Cabinet discussion.      &quot;or theBudget procedure there are special reasons of secrecy.     For the restit may be said that the matters which are not regarded as appropriatefor cpllective discussion by the Cabinet are all, in varying degrees,matters requiring a quasi-judicial decision.     Guch a decision, in the lastresort, can best be given by the judgment of a single individual.Moreover, it must be a decision which is, and is seen to be, taken on anobjective appreciation of all the relevant factors.    Although these mayinclude political factors, political considerations and influences must notbe thought to have carried undue weight in the decision - and the Cabinetis, necessarily and properly, a political body.-21d-
questions concerning foreign and military affairs are notnecessarily Brought before the Cabinet for decision,   althoughthey are frequently discussed in Cabinet and Minister a arekept informed by the circulation of memoranda and telegramsby the Foreign Office, Commonwealth Relations Office andColonial Office and, In certain cases, the Service Departments.It is usual for &apos;Foreign Affairs&apos; to be placed at thebeginning of the agenda for the first of the tworegular weekly meetings of the Cabinet, so that the Foreignsecretary has a regular opportunity of informing the Cabinetof current developmentBy 1927 the practice of having &quot;ForeignAffairs* on the Agenda, which had hithertobeen somewhat intermittent, crystallised andthereafter it appeared regularly up to theperiod Immediately before the war.    During1938 and 1939 there were very few Cabinetswhich did not begin with foreign Affairs * asthe first item.    The usual entry en theAgenda was &quot;FORSIGI! AFFAIRS (if required)&quot;,but often a particular Item was noted under thegeneral heading, e.g. &quot;FORJ3IOH AFFAIRS sSituation in China.&quot;   File 48 Part 2, minuteof 22nd November, 1945.During the war it was the regular practiceto put the foreign and military situationsfirst on the Agenda for the Monday meetingsof the War Cabinet.The practice of putting &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;on ths Agenda at the first of the two weeklymeetings of the Cabinet was restored inNovember, 1945.   File k&amp; Part 2, Minute   of27th November, 1945*
ZY        When Parliament In In session Parliamentary Businessis regularly taken, as a first item, at the Thursday meetingof the Cabinet.    The Cabinet are then informed of the businessin the House of Cannons in the following seek;   any necessaryadjustments are taken up and arrangements made for Governmentspokesmen.    The Chief Whip regularly attends for thispurpose.    Business in the House of Lords is discussed whenmatters of controversy arise;   and ether Parliamentary matters(e.g. Select Committees, Committee of Privileges) are oftenraised at the same time.See generally File U/l/51.The Parliamentary programme was netregularly reviewed week by week by pre-warCabinets.Until October, 19h7 it was customary torecord details of even routine business in theCabinet minutes.     It was then arranged, with theagreement of the Prime Minister, the LardPresident (as Leader of the House of Commons) andthe Chief ?hlp, that details would be omittedfrom the minutes and a separate note circulatedby the Secretary of the Cabinet, eachThursday afternoon, showing the House offor the following week.    This practicewas, however, discontinued in 19h8, andDepartments now receive (from the GovernmentWhips* Office) only copies of the business state-msnt in the House of Commons.    Any significantAny significantpoints arising are, however, noted in theCabinet -At the last regular meeting of the Cabinetbefore a Parliamentary recess It is usual totake the Parliamentary business for the firstweek after theOn occasion, if the Cabinet is not meetingon Thursday, ^Parliamentary Business* is takenearlier in the week.    Frequently, howeverchanges have to made subsequently.     (Sxceptionallythe House of Commons programme is sometimessettled outside the Cabinet in discussion betweenthe Chiep /hip and the Leader of the House ofand. If necessary, the Prime Minister).In 1949, when limited Parliamentary timewas allowed for Private Membera&apos; Bills, pointsarising from discussion of them by theLegislation Committee were taken with&quot;Parliamentary Business&quot; and the Government^attitude on each Bill explained.
At regular intervale ^onomie Affairs * is pat on theAgenda, when the periodical Economic Report submitted by theChancellor of the Exchequer Is discussed.

The first Report (C P. (47)309) wascirculated on 21st November, 1947s and EconomicAffairs1 first appeared on,the agenda on2nd December, 19U7 (CM. 92(47)2).     For thefirst few months the Report was submittedfortnightly, but a monthly report was latersubmitted.The BudgetjL The budget is outlined orally to the Cabinet by theChancellor of the Exchequer before it is presented in theRouse of Commons, but the Chancellor*s statement and thediscussion on it are not recorded.in the minutes.On attendance at *Budget Cabinets *See Jennings, p 182.The Budget is normally taken at a special;33eting of the Cabinet on the day beforethe Budget is presented in the House of Commons(preferably at an afternoon meeting).     Onoccasion (e.g. CM.36(47) and 86(47)) otherbusiness has been taken at the same meeting,but efforts are always made to avoid this.In 1917 the Cabinet minutes recorded theBudget discussion in some   detail, but sincethen details have never been recorded.

The dates of recent &apos;Budget Cabinets&apos; inrelation to the date of the Budget are:-Cigfr^fit Budget1945: 22nd October (a.nw) 23rd October1946: 8th April (a.ra.)      9th April1947: 14th April (p.ia.) 15th April&quot; nth November 1a.m.) 12th November1948* 5th April (a.m.)      6th April1949: 5th April (a.m.)      6th Aprilv/hjte PapersThere is no requirement that proposed White Papers as suchshould be brought before the Cabinet before they are published.White Papers on major questions of policy are, however, normallysubmitted to a Ministerial Committee or the Cabinet before issue.See File 4/3/137, particularly minute of8th April, 1946.On publicity arrangements for White Paperssee Part *?T/ .2fc
ACTIOB PRIOR TO SUBMISSIOB OF BPSIHB832$        Toe current notes on procedure state:-The business of the Cabinet consists, in the main, of -(i)   Questions of major policy which affect a number ofDepartments or engage the collective responsibilityof the Government.(11) Questions on which there is a conflict of interestbetween Departments which has not been resolved.Except in cases of extreme urgency, questions fallingunder the second of these heads should not be referred to theCabinet until all possible means of resolving the conflicthave been exhausted, including personal correspondence ordiscussion between the Ministers concerned.Similarly, it is the rule that matters falling under thefirst head should be thoroughly examined at the official level,if necessarily interdepartmentally, before they are referred toMinisters, so that the policy decisions required may beclearly defined.Proposals which involve expenditure or affect generalfinancial or economic policy should always be discussedwith the Treasury - and, if Treasury agreement has not beensecured at the official level, with the Chancellor of theExchequer - before they are submitted to the Cabinet or toa Ministerial Committee.    Full consideration must also begiven to the probable cost in terms of man-power of anyproposal involving new or extended administrative commitments.It is a standing instruction that any proposals submitted forconsideration shall, if they would Involve the employment ofadditional staff or would place a financial burden on theExchequer, be accompanied by an estimate of -(a) the man-power likely to be required by GovernmentDepartments (and also, where practicable, anestimate of the man-power required outside theGovernment service);   and(b) the cost to the Exchequer, whether direct or throughgrants-in-aid of local rates.An indication should always be given that the cost to theExchequer has been discussed with the Treasury;   and specialattention should be drawn to proposals of whose potentialman-povter requirements the Treasury have not been Informed.These rules do not, of course, limit the right of Ministersto submit to the Cabinet memoranda setting out their views ongeneral issues of policy.Ministers should not hesitate to consult the Law Officers,as colleagues in the Government, on legal questions whicharise in the formulation and administration of policy.Matters which fall wholly within the Departmentalresponsibility of a single Minister and do not engage thecollective responsibility of the Government need not bebrought to Cabinet at all.    A precise definition of suchmatters cannot be given and in borderline eases a Ministeris well advised to bring the matter before his colleagues.(CP. (h9)95, paragraphs 1-7)
In January, 1920 the Cabinet (1(20)) ruledthat the financial details of proposals must bediscussed with the Treasury before submission,and to this end they agreed that a Treasuryrepresentative should be added to the CabinetSecretariat.In 1924 it was laid down (Cab. 27(24)4) thatthe Law Officers should see draft Bills at anearly stage and that prior consultation betweenDepartments should always be carried out.    ATreasury circular was issued (April, 1924) coveringthese points;   it also laid down the rule thatno memorandum could be put on the Cabinet agendauntil at least five days after its circulation.This circular was re-issued when Mr. Baldwin&apos;aGovernment took office later in 1921* (Cab. 59(24)1).In 1929 the Cabinet ruled that draft Billsshould not be submitted until after their subjectmatter had been fully examined between theDepartment responsible and the Treasury, theLaw Officers (where contentious Bills wereconcerned) and the other Departments interested.(Cab. 22(29)1).     This decision was speciallybrought to the attend!on of Departments in 1931in Treasury Circular 8/31 of 25th February, 1931and again in Treasury Circular Ho. 13/37 of24th June, 1937.     Piles 15/34/1 Fts. 1 and 2)Before the war all Bills had to have priorapproval by the Cabinet before introduction, butduring the war this practice lapsed.     In 1944,however, in connection with the RequisitionedLand and ..ar-/orks Bill (which had beenintroduced without submission of the draft tothe   ar Cabinet) the War Cabinet ruled that noBill dealing with a controversial subject shouldbe introduced unless the policy had been consideredand approved by the War Cabinet. (W.M*25(45)4).In December, 1942 the Bar Cabinet asked(W.P. (42) 541 and W.M.l63(42)) that fullconsideration should be given to the man-powerimplications of new proposals.In 1947 Departments were required, in termsof Treasury Circular Ho. 16/47, to see that whenproposals were put before the Cabinet or aministerial Committee an estimate was includedof any additional man-power required to put theminto effect.     This instruction was repeated inthe general directive issued by the Prime Ministerin November, 1948 (C.P. (48)288) on the cost ofnew schemes in men and money.    The substance ofthis directive was reproduced in paragraph 4 ofCP. (49) 95.    Pile 15/34/36.
The Cabinet*s uiscussion normally proceeds on the basisof memoranda circulated la advance of their meeting.The current notes on procedure state:-Memoranda for the Cabinet should be as brief and as clearas possible.    The model memorandum explains at the outsetwhat the problem is, indicates briefly the relevantconsiderations and concludes with a precise statement of thedecision sought.    While it is sometimes useful to includea summary of the main points brought out in the body of thememorandum, such a summary should never exceed a few lines;any longer summary defeats its purpose and simply meansrepetition.    So far as possible prefatory covering notes shouldbe avoided.    To facilitate reference in discussion, paragraphsshould be numbered.     Supporting data may often be relegatedto an Appendix.    If authority is sought to make a statementor despatch a telegram a draft may be attached.    Time spentin making a memorandum short and clear will be saved many timesover in reading and in discussion;   and it is the duty ofMinisters to ensure that this is done by personal scrutiny,and where necessary revision of the memoranda submitted tothem by their officials.    In particular, the use ofunnecessary neologisms and obscure technical terms should beavoided.(CP. (49)95, paragraph 10)A memorandum intended for consideration by the Cabinet,other than one commenting on a memorandum already circulated,must be circulated two clear days before the meeting atwhich it le to be considered.    A precise formulation of thisrule has been issued to all Departments by the Secretary of theCabinet, who is responsible for seeing that it is strictlyenforced.    The permission of the Prime Minister is required forany exception to this rule and will be granted only in casesof extreme urgency.(CP. (43)95, paragraph 9)The pre-war rule was that memorandashould be circulated five clear days beforethe meeting at which they were to be considered(C.P.88(36) Appendix I).     This rule (which wentback to 1924) was relaxed during the war of 1939-45during which the .resent two day rule wasintroduced.In 1945 when the Caretaker Government tookoffice a number of Coalition Government memorandaremained to be considered.     The Secretary of theCabinet asked the successors of the outgoingMinisters responsible for these memoranda whetherthey were prepared to resubmlt them in their ownname or whether they wished them to be withdrawn.A number were in fact considered without changeby the new Cabinet.

1st 1932 the Prime Minister (Mr* Maedonald)(Cab.9(32)11) asked &quot;that bis colleagues shouldmake It a regular practice before circulatingmemoranda to the Cabinet to pass them throughhis hands.&quot;   Such prior submission became therule, but in 1934 the Prime Minister renewedhis request, adding that &quot;he took a lenientview as to what should be circulated&quot;(Cab 13(34)1 and 30(34)2).     It is not clearlyestablished when the practice of priorsubmission to the  rims Minister lapsed.    In1943* however, the Prime Minister *s PrivateSecretary said that for all practical purposesthe practice had lapsed.   (Minute of 27th April,1943  Pile 4/V6A Ft. 2)It was also customary before the War to sendto the Chancellor of the Exchequer a copy of allmemoranda received for circulation and to delaycirculation until his consent was obtained.This practice lapsed on the outbreak of war in1939.ACTIOR IK TEE OABIHBT OFFICENotes on current practice in the Cabinet OffieeJLn thearrangement of Cabinet business are given in Annex //    .
A programme of future business giving provisional noticeof subjects which will come up for discussion during thefollowing week, together with the numbers of any papersalready issued on those subjects, is, after approval by thePrime Minister, circulated by the Secretary to the Cabineteach Friday.Before the War the Secretary circulatedregularly to members of the Cabinet a weekly listof subjects awaiting consideration (CP.88(36)paragraph 1).    This practice was abandoned duringthe War, but advance notice of the followingweek&apos;s business was given whenever possible.

They shew subject a to bediscussed at the meeting (with references to relevantmemoranda and any earlier discussions) and indicate the Ministers]other than members of the Cabinet required to be present atthe discussion.   Ministers not in the Cabinet sutaaoned tomeetings for particular items receive an agenda paper on whichthe approximate time is set against each item.Per details of current and pent practicesee PartfVi   and for preparation of the AgendaThe receipt of the /Sgenda is regarded asan invitation to a Cabinet meeting.Before the War it was customary to seedwith the copies of the Agenda a formal noticecalling a meeting &quot;of His Majesty&apos;s servants&quot;.This notice was issued for Tuesday meetings ofthe War Cabinet (see minute of 31st December,1940 in Pile 48 Ft. 1), but the practice lapsed.In order that the custom might not be completelyforsaken the notice was issued (with the PrimeMinister&apos;s approval) la connection with themeeting of the Cabinet held on 5th April, 1948(Budget Cabinet).   See Pile 4/2/52.(Cab.1^^!)??^before a CP. number was asked for in orderto avoid overloading the Cabinet Agenda withmatters which are only sent for information&quot;.The practice of &quot;taking note&quot; of documents ofthis character lapsed on the appointment ofthe War Cabinet, and it was not resumed afterthePOP &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;, &quot;Parliamentarymoo&quot; and &quot;^conoraic Affairs&quot; as items cthe Agenda see ps^-ws .For notes on pre-war practice in thepreparation of the Agenda see minute of 2tubar. 1936 on File 4/y4.
General araPUftgThe Prime Minister always takes the chair at Cabinetmeetings, unless he is unavoidably absent;   in that eventthe member of the Cabinet next in order of precedence takes theehair.The Lord President took the Chair at onemeeting in 1947 (CM.73(47))b and at onemeeting in 1948 (C.M.56(48)),      On occasionthe Foreign Secretary (CM. 57(48)) or theChancellor of the Exchequer (Cm.58(48)) haspresided.Meetings are normally held in the Cabinet Room at10, Downing street,    If it is necessary for the Cabinet tomeet at a time when the House of Commons is sitting andimportant divisions are due to take place, or when a numberof senior Ministers must be within easy reach of the Chamber,the meeting is held In the Prime Minister&apos;e room in the Houseof Commons.In September, 1921 the Cabinet held twomeetings in Scotland (Town Hall, Inverness, andBrahan Castle)   (Cab. 74 and 75(21)).During the war of 1939-45 meetings wereoften held in the Cabinet War Boom.In recent years the Cabinet has on a fewoccasions during the Summer Heeess met in Confer-ence Room *B* in the Cabinet Office and not inthe Cabinet iioocy     (e.g. CM.56 (49), 52(49))*The reason for this has usually been to makeit easier to prevent knowledge of themeeting from becoming public.    In the summer of1949, at the time of the discussions on thedevaluation of the pound sterling thepossibility of holding a Cabinet meeting,at Chequers was canvassed,In the 19th Century the Cabinet metoccasionally at the Foreign Office, and inearlier periods often at the j&amp;ouse ofthe member who had business to submit.    SeeHankey, Diplomacy by Conference, page 49.The Cabinet does not normally note;   all decisions mustrepresent general agreement, and discussion continues untilthe general sense of the meeting appears.Exceptionally in the past some Cabinetsappear on occasion to have decided questionsby   vote.    See Jennings, 202-3*Per general discussion of practice atCabinet meetings in the past^see, Jennings,Chapter IX, Section 5, and notes in File 4/1/56.
ft HFrequency of Mee^aKfiThe Cabinet normally meets at present tales a week - onMondays and Thursdays - while Parliament is sitting, butadditional meetings are held as required.On the timing of meetings and on theadvantages of meetings on Tuesdays as contrastedwith Mondays see Annex II. and minute of27th November, 1945 on Pile 48 Pt. 2.The pre-war Cabinet usually met ones swool: (on Wednesdays) during the ParliamentarySession.   In the period immediately before theoutbreak of War the Cabinet met daily and untilFebruary. 1941 the War Cabinet met daily.Thereafter meetings of the war Cabinet wereheld twice a week with additional meetings onothsr days, if necessary, to deal withurgent business.Por statistics of meetings see Annex III.Special or emergency meetlsgs of the Cabinet are usuallysummoned by telephone messages from the Cabinet Office onthe Instructions of the Prime Minister.   The King4a PrivateSecretary should always be informed.   If time allows thearrangements are confirmed by the circulation of as agendaPor the summoning of meetings afteril working hours ass current Instructionsto Duty Officers.   See also Pils 4/1/15.
HtftUftfis in Hotter fWwbila the holiday periods, vis.  aster, a hit sun and Christmas,it is usual to avoid meetings of the Cabinet Committees andindeed of the Cabinet itself, unless specially urgent businessarises.    A few seeks in advance the Secretary of the Cabinettakes the Prime Minister&apos;s instructions on the arrangements tobe made.    The note circulated by the Secretary of the Cabinetat the Prime Minister*s direction usually states that if ameeting of the Cabinet Is required every effort will be madeto hold it on a particular day so that Ministers can make theirown arrangements accordingly.In the summer Parliamentary Recess it is usual to regardthe first six or seven weeks as a close period in whichCabinet Committee meetings are avoided altogether and meetingsof the Cabinet kept as few as possible.    To avoid callingCabinet Committee meetings during this period the practice isto arrange for urgent business which would have been takenat them to be taken instead at the Cabinet.    A submission inthis general sense is made to the Prime Minister early in July.See Pile 4/l/8iThe notes issued on the despatch of businessduring the summer recess have been very similarin the years 1946-49.    In 1946 the note wasdiscussed briefly by the Cabinet (CM. 76(46)1).This was not thought necessary in subsequentyears.The pre-war practice was broadly similar.
Messages aurinp; Meetings.The current notes on procedure states-Ths Prime Minister*s Private Secretary on duty at theCabinet room is responsible for ensuring that the proceedingsof the Cabinet are not disturbed.    To assist him, Ministersshould give general instructions that messages are notto be sent to them while in Cabinet, unless they are so urgentthat they cannot wait until the end of the meeting.(CP. (49)95, paragraph 16)j In June, 1929 the Cabinet (Cab. 24(29)1)agreed /the member seated nearest the doorof the Cabinet Room should take in any messagesfor Ministers.In 1940 it was arranged with the PrimeMinister*s Private Secretary that, even whenthe Prime Minister was not himself present ata Cabinet meeting, one of the Private Secretarieswould be regarded as on duty at the Cabinetroom.    Pile 4/1/14.
AlrHmflftnoe Pf ^eefetarla*In present circumstances, unless be is unavoidablyabsent, the Secretary attends all meetings of the Cabinet.He is normally accompanied by the Deputy Secretary (Civil)and/or the Under-Secretary (according to the subjects on theagenda.)   The Deputy Secretary (Military) attends whenmilitary matters are to be discussed.&quot;The Secretary will attend meetings of theCabinet, unless instructed to the contrary, forthe purpose of recording conclusions.&quot;(CP.88(36), Appendix I, paragraph 2).On the appointment of a senior member of thestaff of the Cabinet Office it is usual for thePrime Minister to be informed by a note fromthe Secretary of the Cabinet that he will beattending Cabinet as a member of the secretariat.Until December, 1916 there was no Secretaryto the Cabinet.    On the formation ofMr. Lloyd George *s War Cabinet in December, 1916,Sir Maurice Hankey, who had been in turnSecretary to the Coazaittee of Imperial Defence,the War Council, the Dardanelles Committee andthe War Committee, out of which the War Cabinetwas evolved, was appointed Secretary to theWar Cabinet.Por general discussion of the position of theSecretary of the Cabinet, see Jennings, pp. 186-9;debate in House of Commons on Cabinet Office vote,13th June, 1922 (Pile I.J.69 (1 and 2);Hankey, Diplomacy by Conference, Chapter 3*War Cabinet meetings during the period1939-45 were normally attended, for thediscussion of particular items, by AssistantSecretaries in addition to the Secretary of theCabinet and his senior colleagues.     See Gibbs,Since the war an Assistant Secretary has onoccasion attended as a member of the Secretariatduring holiday periods.   See   CM. 56, 59 andfci^On 13th October, 1949, and 10th January, 1950,the Cabinet met without a Secretary to discuss the timingof a General Election,   See paragraph 22 above.IT
CaBIKST CQHGLUSIOSSGeneralThe current notes on procedure state:-It is an instruction to the Secretary, in drafting CabinetConclusions to avoid, so far as practicable, reference to opinionsexpressed by particular Ministers.    The record in respect ofeach item will be limited to the decision of the Cabinet,together with such summary of the discussion as may be necessaryfor the guidance of those called upon to take action on thedecision.    Matters of exceptional secrecy may be recorded ina &quot;Confidential Annex&quot;.Copies of the Conclusions are circulated by the Secretaryto Cabinet Ministers and Ministers of Cabinet rank.    Copiesof &quot;Confidential Annexes&quot; are sent only to the Ministersdirectly concerned.Any suggested amendments to Cabinet Conclusions mostreach the Secretary not later than the next day but onefollowing that on which the Meeting was held.     Thereafter theConclusions will be sent to be printed in final form.(CP. (49)95, paragraphs 19-21)In certain circumstances the Secretary may make a record,for inclusion In bis &quot;Standard File of Cabinet Conclusions&quot;,but without any circulation, of particularly delicate andsecret matters discussed at Cabinet.    A copy of these&quot;Ho Circulation Records&quot; is occasionally given to the PrimeMinister*s Private Secretary.Cabinet Conclusions are always available in the CabinetRoom during meetings of the Cabinet for reference by CabinetMinisters.On the form and circulation of CabinetConclusions, etc, see Part V.A systematic record of Cabinet meetings wasnot kept until December, 1916, when the WarCabinet was formed and took over the secretarialmachinery which had served the Committee ofImperial Defence.     Before that date the onlyrecord made of Cabinet decisions (apart fromearly &quot;Minutes of Cabinet&apos;) was a personal notesent by the Prime Minister to the sovereignafter each meeting of the Cabinet.For general discussion of the practice priorto the establishment of the Cabinet Secretariatand historical accounts of early Cabinetpractice, including the results of researchesin the archives at Windsor, etc., see Hankey,Diplomacy by Conference, Chapter 3j   Jennings,Chapter 9, Sections 3-5, 7 and 8;   .4nson,Vol. II (i) pp. 119-121;   File 4/1/56.Cabinet Conclusions and Cabinet Minutesare the same.    For a short time, however, aftertbe full Cabinet was restored in 1919 there wasa distinction between the two, the Conclusionsrepresenting the summary record and the minutes
a detailed report of which only a very fewcopies were made.    Ia a notein File GJm/G/2QSir M. Hankey stated: &quot;It was contemplated.... that in addition to the &quot;Conclusions*circulated to all members of the Cabinet,somewhat fuller minutes would be required.In practice, however, it has been found moreconvenient that the &quot;Conclusions * shouldconstitute the sole official record&quot;.     (Seealso Annex I. p. 4, to C.P.30(24)) -    In 1932Mr. George Lansburjg alleged in the House ofCommons that the Secretary of the Cabinetkept a full record of Cabinet meetings Inaddition to the Conclusions.     In the lightof correspondence with Sir M. Hankey hesubsequently explained that he had beenmisinformed and that the conclusions werethe sole record.   (Hansard. House of Commons,12th February, 1932, Cols. 1163-4;   FileCAB/A/27.)On one occasion in 1925 Sir M. Hankeyrecorded in manuscript, for the Informationof the king, a Cabinet discussion on aspecially secret matter.     (File CAB/a/13).
Decisions of the Cabinet are normally unanimous.In the past, however, the dissent of particular Ministershas sometimes, exceptionally, been recorded in the Cabinetconclusions.The conclusions of the meeting of the Cabineton 25th July, 1922 (42(22) 3 and h) (Anglo-American Debt), note the fact that the Lord PrivySeal (ir, A. Chamberlain) and the Chancellorof the Saccbequer (Sir Robert Home) asked thattheir dissent might be recorded,    Lord Balfour(Lord President) stated, when the propriety ofthis was questioned, that In his view theconfidential record of a dissent did not infringethe rule that Ministers were corporatelyresponsible for all Cabinet decisions, and thisview was accepted.The question was again raised in 1931 andthe Cabinet (81(31)6) took the view, putforward by the Prime Minister (Mr, Macdonald,)that &quot;the recording of notes of dissent orreservation was contrary to the general principleof Cabinet unity.On 22nd January, 1932, however, the Cabinetagreed that in the case of discussions relatingto balance of trade, import duties and cognatematters members of the Cabinet should beentitled to record their dissent from conclusionsof the Cabinet (7(32)2).   Several such notesof dissent are recorded (the &quot;agreement todiffer^.
The current notes on procedure state ex-All Ministers are responsible for giving such instructionsto their Departments as may be necessary to give effect tothe Conclusions of the Cabinet, and for communicating tosubordinate Departments or branches decisions of which theyshould be made aware.      here an urgent matter arises inCabinet unexpectedly, and a decision is reached requiringimmediate action by a Department not represented at themeeting, the Secretary will ensure that the Departmentconcerned is notified forthwith.(CP. (49)95, paragraph 22)It was the practice of the Secretary tothe War Cabinet of 1916 - 1919 to send acovering note with each copy of the Conclusionscirculated indicating which Departments wereexpected to take action on the decisionsrecorded.In 1924 the Cabinet (59(24)1) askedMinisters to enquire into the arrangements intheir Departments for giving effect to decisions.In 1929 the Cabinet agreed that, in caseswhere a Minister was not available (throughillness, urgent public business, or for someother reason) to instruct his Department inregard to decisions taken at Cabinet, the PrimeMinister had authority to arrange for notificatiorto be made to the Permanent Head of theDepartment.    The Secretary was instructed tobring such cases to the Prime Minister&apos;s notice.(CM. 23(29)3).In September, 1939 a circular letter wassent to Private Secretaries making it clearthat, notwithstanding the practice in theWar Cabinet of 1916-19, Departments wereexpected to take action forthwith on receiptsof the Conclusions.    Pile   f$l&apos;
In 1940 the War Cabinet decided(W.M,268(40)8) that the Secretary shouldcirculate weekly to Departments a scheduleof the Conclusions reached by the Cabinet Inthe previous week and of the Conclusionsrecorded in previous schedules until be hadbeen informed by the Departments concernedin writing that the action called for hadbeen taken, or, in the case of long-termprojects, that the initial steps had beentaken to implement the Cabinet^ s decision.The first series of schedules was issued on23rd October, 1940.    This practice was main-tained after the war, but the intervals atwhich the schedules were circulated werelengthened.     The present modified practicewas introduced in 1947*     See File  48/36*On 25th August, 1947 (C.M.74(47)2) theCabinet asked the Secretary to consider&quot;whether any further machinery was requiredto ensure that the arrangements for followingup and progressing decisions by Ministerswere adequate to the needs of the i. resentemergency&quot;.   Various means of improving thearrangements (&quot;black lists&quot;, progress reports,etc.) were discussed;   one of the results wasthe institution of the periodical EconomicReports to the Cabinet by the Chancellor of theExchequer.     File 30/22/56.The Secretary of the Cabinet circulates to Departmentsfrom time to time schedules of Cabinet Conclusions (&quot;BlackList&quot;) on which no report has been received by him thataction has been taken.
SBCSBCY OF CABIHBT FROCSSDIHGSIt is the established role that proceedings of theCabinet are secret.    It is the personal responsibility ofCabinet Ministers to see that there is no leakage ofinformation about discussions in the Cabinet.    Theircollective responsibility for the decisions of the Cabinetimposes this need for discretion upon them and they arebound also by the Privy Councillor&apos;s oath.precautions against unauthorised disclosures of informationartf noted in paragraphs 3^8 of CP. (49)95.For earlier notes on the need forsecrecy see File 4/1/6A.For general discussion of the secrecy ofCabinet proceedings see Jennings, pp. 208-210.The relevant passage of the PrivyCouncillor^ oath is;-&quot;You shall, in all things to be moved,treated, and debated in Council, faith-fully and truly declare your Mind andOpinion according to your Heart andConscience and shall keep secret allMatters revealed unto your or that shallbe treated of secretly in Council.    Andif any of the said Treaties or Councilsshall touch any of the Counsellors, youshall not reveal it unto him, but willkeep the same until such time as, by theConsent of His Majesty, or of the Council,Publication shall be made thereof.&quot;On the procedure for tracing leakages ofinformation see generally File S50/10/15.On the King&apos;s consent to disclosure ofCabinet proceedings in statements by resigningMinisters, see Part II.On the Security of Cabinet Documents andrestrictions on their circulation see Part V.The records of Cabinet proceedings Includemany references to leakage of information andmany injunctions to Ministers on the Importanceof preserving secrecy, particularly in thehandling of Cabinet conclusions.     Thus iniiarch, 1922 the Cabinet decided, because offrequent leakages, that only two full copies ofCabinet conclusions should be made.     Later in1922 (Cab. 68(22)9) the Cabinet discussed amemorandum by Lord Stanf ordham on instances ofunauthorised public references to proceedings inCabinet:   it was made clear that the King&apos;spermission was necessary before such disclosureswere made (Cab. 68(22)9, and originalmemorandum there filed).
The current notes on procedure stateWhile the collective responsibility of Ministers oftencalls for discussion between Ministers on some importantquestion which falls wholly or mainly within the purview ofa single Department, the normal course is for the resultingdecision to be announced and defended by the Ministerconcerned as his own decision.There may be rare occasions when it is desirable toemphasise the importance of some decision by statingspecifically that it is the decision of His MajestyTsGovernment.     This, however, should be the exception ratherthan the rule.    The growth of any general practice wherebydecisions of the Cabinet were announced as such would leadto embarrassment.    Thus, some decisions of Governmentwould be regarded as less authoritative than others.(CP.(h9)95, paragraphs 29 and 30)On the exceptional practice of publicreference to a decision as a &quot;decision of theCabinet&quot;   (as an alternative to &quot;His Majesty&apos;sGovernment&quot;)   see minutes of 29th and 30th  May,I9U6 on File 4/1/6A.    General statements ofprocedure prior to CP. (49)95 allowed thisalternative.It was agreed by the Cabinet in 1929 thatin any case where a member of the Cabinetthought it to be in the public interest toissue a Press communique or any announcementof Cabinet decision he should first consultthe Prime Minister.   (Cab 22(29)1).
Ho communiques arennow issued to the Press about theholding of Cabinet meeting or the attendance at them.Press references to prospective meetings and to actualmeetings and attendance are normally based on unofficial orunauthorised disclosures, speculation, or observation byPress representatives of the movements of Ministers, butunofficial guidance is sometimes given, as a matter of policy,through the Prime Ministers Adviser on Public Nations.On 6th November, 1919 the Cabinet (3(19)2)asked the Secretary to publish a press noticeafter each meeting of the Cabinet, stating whowas present.    It became customary also toindicate the subjects discussed.     On 12thNovember, 1924 it was decided (Cab. 59(24)1) atthe first meeting of Mr, Baldwin&apos;s Cabinet torevert to the practice of giving a list ofnames only without any particulars of thesubjects discus ed.     For a specimen noticesee File 4/1/55.   On particular occasions theCabinet asked that a press notice should notbe issued or agreed that it should take the formof a specially drafted announcement.During the war this practice was droppedand Defence Notice prohibited the publicationof any information about future meetings ofthe Cabinet,   the place where the meetingshad been or were to be held, the subject matterof Cabinet meetings and the names of Ministersand others present.In January, 1948 the question of resumingthe pre-war practice was discussed, but it wasdecided not to pursue the matter.   File 4/1/53*On 27th May, 1936 reports were given inB.B.C. news bulletins of what was believedto have passed at a Cabinet meeting that morning.On the instructions of the Cabinet the Secretaryof the Cabinet wrote to the Director-Generalasking that in future no statement should be madein news bulletins on proceedings in Cabinet witfa-out direct authority for the Statement from10, Downing Street.     The B.B.b. accepted thisarrangement, but pointed out that it Imposedrestrictions which were not applied to responsiblenewspapers.    In reply the Secretary, on thehome Secretary&apos;s advice, made the point thatthe B.B.C. stood in a special position ofresponsibility to bhe public and that a cleardistinction ought to be drawn between abroadcast announcement which went into every homeand a mere statement in the Press.    See FilePUB/B/I3.    In recent years, however, the   B.B.C.have frequently quoted, on the basis of agencyreports, statements by political and othercorrespondents tn matters believed to have beendiscussed at Cabinet.
In 1917 Lord Curzon suggested that reports should heprepared to &quot;present to Parliament and the public a clearlycompiled record of the war histories and the accomplishmentof the period since the present Government assumed officein December 1916&quot;.   (Pile 70/15).     The War Cabinet agreedthat a draft should be prepared, and a report was eventuallypublished   (Cmd. 3005.).   A second report (Cmd. 325) waspublished in 1918, but the practice was then discontinued.In 19kk, the Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill)replying to a question in the House said that itwas not proposed to prepare for publicationreports on the War Cabinet then in office.(Hansard. House of Commons. 22nd February. 1944Col. 656.)
Cabinet PhotographsIt is not an invariable custom for new Cabinets to bephotographed.     The initiative is normally taken by thePrime Minister or a member of the Cabinet or by a photographerwriting to a Cabinet Minister suggesting a photograph.Mr. Attlee*s Cabinet was photographed in August. 1945,shortly after the Government took office.     The photographswere taken by press and photographic agencies under arrangementsmade by the Ministry of Information;   news reel films werealso made.    On earlier occasions of Cabinet photographsspecialist photographers (Bassano   and Vandyk) were called In,but a rota press photographer has also been present.     Thescene has always been the garden at 10, Downing Street,and suggestions for photographs of the Cabinet in session havealways   been rejected.It has been usual for Cabinet photographs to be taken about15 minutes before a meeting of the Cabinet.     The arrangementsfor the attendance of photographers and for seating, etc., inthe garden are made by the Private Secretary at 10, Downing StreetThe Cabinet Office is responsible (1) for advising generallyin the light of past practice;   (11) for preparing and submittingfor the Prime Minlster*s approval a &quot;seating and standing &quot;plan (based on the precedence of member of the Cabinet); and(ill) for notifying Ministers of the time and the arrangementsgenerally.     The main questions to be considered, in consultationwith 10, Downing Street, are (a) when should the photographsbe taken? (b) what groups should be taken (e.g. Cabinet, Cabinetwith Ministers of Cabinet rank, Cabinet with Secretary)?(c) what photographers should be commissioned?See generally Pile 4/5/16 (minutes of5th June, 1945 and 24th June, 1948).In 1924 the first Labour Cabinet rejectedthe request for a Cabinet photograph (Cab. 7(24)10)but subsequently agreed. (Cab. 16(24)12).The War Cabinet was photographed on severaloccasions.     File 48/24.In 1944 photographs of Dominion and UnitedKingdom Ministers were taken in the Cabinet Room.File 9/7/5.In June, 1948 suggestions for a Cabinetphotograph were made to the Lord Presidentby an independent photographer.     The PrimeMinister agreed;   but in the event it provedimpossible to find a convenient time for thephotograph, and the matter was dropped.In 1947 an artist commissioned by anAmerican Journal wished to have access to theCabinet Room in order to paint an imaginarySession of the War Cabinet for purposes ofillustration in the serial publication ofMr. Churchillfs memoirs.     The request wasrejected after discussion with the Prime minister&apos;sPrivate Secretary.
Cabinet presents ate.There are many precedents for collective presents by theCabinet. e.g. on the occasion of Princess Elizabeth&apos;s marriage.These matters are normally handled by the Prime MinistersPrivate Secretary and are usually mentioned at Cabinet by thePrime Minister, but, under current practice a reference isnot normally made in the Cabinet minutes.   &apos;On the death of a member or a formermember of the Cabinet it is usual for awreath to be sent in the name of the Cabinet.The initiative is taken by the Prime Minister sPrivate Seeretar,, but the Cabinet Office may beasked to assist, e.g., in the collection ofcontributions from Ministers.
