COPY NO J ^THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT. SECRET.CP. 227    (57).CABINET.INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANISATION MARITIME CONFERENCE,  1956.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.Two sessions of the International Labour Conference were held in October, 1936, to deal with maritime questions, The texts of the draft Conventions and Recommendations have been published (Cmd.5392 and 5393) and I should be glad if definite decisions could be taken as to the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the various instruments so that I can be in a position to give authoritative answers if the subject is raised.At these two sessions the Conference adopted six Conventions and two Recommendations.    The instruments and the action of the British Government Delegates on them were:-Action ofCONVENTIONS. British Delegates.1. Hours and Manning Voted against.2. Professional Capacity Voted against.3. Holidays with Pay. Abstained.4. Shipowners&apos;  liability in respect of sick and injured seamen. Voted against.5. Insurance of sickseamen. Voted for.6. Minimum age ofemployment at sea.

2*1 c)1. HOURS AND MANKING.Instructions to delegates followed the lines of the Memorandum circulated by the Minister of Labour on 17th July, 1936 (CP. 199/36).In broad outline, the Convention provides in ships of over 2,000 tons gross a maximum working week of 56 hours for deck officers and men (with certain provisions as to extra hours for officers);    in ships of over 700 tons gross a maximum working week of 56 hours for engineer officers and engine room ratings;    in cargo ships a ten-hour day for ratings in the catering department, and in passenger ships a rest period each day of at least twelve hours, of wuich eight shall be consecutive.     As regards manning, the Convention provides that in addition to the master there shall be two deck officers in ships of over 700 tons gross, three deck officers in ships of over 2,0J0 tons gross, and three engineer officers in ships of over 700 tons gross. A manning scale for deck ratings is laid down which is not widely different from that in force at present in this country.I am not prepared to recommend that the ratification of this Convention should be favourably considered by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom mainly for the following reasons:-(a) I regard it as wrong in principle to lay downmaximum working hours in the case of persons in highly responsible positions, such as ships&apos; officers.     Further, there is no Agreement in operation under the National Maritime Board dealing with the hours of officers, and ratification of the Convention would mean legislation in the teeth of strong and justifiable opposition from shipowners.
(b) The tonnage limit at which the three-watch system and certain other provisions of the Convention become operative is 2,000 tons, whereas in this country the limit at which similar arrangements are operative is 2,500 tons.      Similarly, as regards the working hours of deckhands, the maximum in the Convention is 56 hours per week, whereas the Agreement between owners and men in this country provides for an additional eight hours per week, over the 56 hcuj^s, for maintenance purposes.The Agreements operative in this country were made by the National Maritime Board, which may be briefly described as the Whitlejr Council of the Shipping Industry, and which discharges its functions admirably.      So far as deckhands are concerned the result was to reduce working hours on the larger ships from 84 to 64 per week, and this considerable change, together with others.? came into operation only so   recently as 1st October, 1936.     There has, therefore, been no adequate experience of their effects.      When my predecessor was asked in the House of Commons on 17th November last (O.R.  col.1487) why our Delegation had opposed the Convention In its present form, he replied that we were not prepared to vary the Agreements of the National Maritime Board without experience of their working.      But, apart from this I should not be prepared to risk the certain destruction of the valuable conciliation machinery of the National Maritime Board which would inevitably follow the forcible supersession of their voluntary Agreements.
(c)   The Convention does not contain adequate safeguards against its coming into force before our main competitors have adopted its terms. The British Government Delegates tried to secure the insertion of a provision that the Convention should come into force only when all countries with more than one million tons of shipping had ratified it.      They failed, and the Convention as adopted requires the ratification of only five principal maritime countries to make it effective. It is impossible for us to contemplate being bound by this Convention which would place upon shipowners considerable further burdens, v/hile at the same time many of our principal competitors might be free of any similar obligations.      There are matters, such for example as those connected with safety of life at sea, in which it is right and proper for this country to take the lead whether or not other countries follow immediately.     Each such case must he considered on its merits.      But in my opinion there is no justification on the merits of this case for even considering binding ourselves interna/tionally until we are sure that our principal competitors are simila3?ly bound. For these reasons, I should like authority to say defihitcly that we cannot accept this Convention.&apos;2&apos;      PROFESSIONAL CAPACITY.The Convention provides that masters and deck and engineer officers in charge of a watch should be certificated, and it applies this requirement to home-trade and coasting-trade ships, as well as to foreign-going ships. The proposal sounds reasonable, but in fact the provisions are unnecessary, and in some respects impracticable.     Even
in fsreign-going ships it would net, for example, &quot;be possible to comply strictly with the ter is of the Convention as regards engineer officers without seriously interfering with the training of junior engineer officers.     As regards home trade and coasting carg^ (as distinct from passenger)  ships, our law does not require certificated officers at all.      This is a state of affairs which I should have no hesitation in asking Parliament ta alter if there was any evidence that in practice it involved danger to the crews of these ships or to the safety of other shipping.      In fact, however, there is no evidence of this kind, and I can see no reascn for introducing legislation for which there is no practical necessity and which would, in my view, serve no useful purpose, merely   in order ta enable this country to ratify this particular Convention.I should, therefore, like authority to say that we cannot consider favourably the ratification of this Convention, 3,  HOLIDAYS tflTH PAY.The Convention provides twelve days holiday with pay for masters, officers and wireless operators, and nine days for ether members of the crew, after a qualifying period of one year&apos;s continuous service.      At the International Labour Conference in June, 1936, a Convention was adopted for industrial workers providing holidays with pay after one year&apos;s continuous service. This Convention has been laid on the table of the House as Cmd.5305.      No decision as to the attitude of His Majesty1s Government to this Convention has yet been taken, but the main reason urged against its adoption at the Conference in June 1936, that it failed to benefit the very large class of workers not in continuous employment, is stronger in the case of Shipping thanperhaps of any ether industry, owing to the general practice of discharging crews at the end of each voyage and re-engaging either the same or, often, quite a different crew for the subsequent voyage.The question of holidays with pay in industry generally hasbeen remitted to a Committee for examination and no decision on this Convention can be taken until the result of this investigation is known, -5-
4. SHIPOWNERS&apos;  LIABILITY IN RESPECT OP SICK AND INJURED SKAMEN.The Convention places upon the shipowner liability for medical care and maintenance of seamen left sick or injured abroad, and, in certain circumstances, for the payment of wages after discharge.     The law of tais country makes a shipowner liable for the medical care and maintenance of a seaman until he is cured, or is landed at his proper return port.     The Convention allows the shipowner to limit his liability to a period of sixteen weeks from the date of injury or sickness, whether or not the seaman is returned to a proper return port.     The Convention would require the shipowner in ca.es where the sixteen weeks had not elapsed to undertake the medical care and maintenance of a seaman in his own country, if he was not entitled to benefit under a national insurance scheme in that country.    Efforts to insert in the Convention a provision allowing the British system as an alternative were unsuccessful, although there is no doubt that that system is more advantageous to the seaman, since it provides for his care until he is placed m a position where he can be cared for under the National Health Insurance Scheme in this country.As regards wages after discharge, the Convention would impose on shipowners a liability which does not exist at present under British law for seamen who are not re-sident in this country and whose own countries do not protect them under a national health insurance scheme.There are other divergences between the Convention and United Kingdom law, but the fundamental difference is that concerning the duration of liability.     In my view, it would be a retrograde step, from the point of view of the welfare of the seaman, to adopt the Convention scheme instead of our own, and I should, therefore, like authority to say that His majesty&apos;s Government are not prepared to ratify the Convention.
9^ &amp; 6 e5.  INSURANCE OF SIGX SEAMEN.This Convention could he adopted without any alteration of United Kingdom legislation.     At Geneva, all British delegates, Government    employers and workers, voted in favour of the Convention,,      I have recently communicated with the National Maritime Board to enquire whether the shipowners and seamen were still of the same mind, and I have teen informed that they would approve of ratification by His Majesty&apos;s Government.      In these circumstances, I propose, if my colleagues agree,  to proceed, in consultation with the Minister of Labour and the Minister of Health, who also agree, to ratify the Convention.6. MINIMUM AGE OF EMPLOYMENT AT island.An International Labour Convention was adopted in 1920 and ratified by His Majesty&apos;s Government, fixing 14 years as the minimum age for employment at sea.      The proposal before the 1936 Conference was thot the minimum age should be raised to 15.      The British delegates secured a proviso with regard to beneficial employment following the provisions of the Education Acts, 1936, with the result that the new Convention could be adopted by this country without any change in our law as soon as the Acts come into force.British employers&apos;  and workers&apos;  delegates voted with the British Government delegates in favour of this Convention at Geneva and I have since ascertained that they are in favour of ratification.      I should, therefore, be glad of authority to proceed to ratification in consultation with the Minister of Labour.7. WELFARE OF SEAMEN IN PORT.This recommendation contains little that is contentious. It suggests the setting up of welfare committees in the important ports and formulates certain measures which should be taken with regard to the sale of intoxicating liquor, the treatment of disease, facilities for recreation
and accommodation of seamen, and certain other measures which are already carried out in this country,,Both shipowners and seamen agree to the adoption of this Recommendation, and I should li?-:e to be able to say that the Government will adopt this Recommendation and that, in accordance with the general procedure in relation to recommendations of the International Labour Conference,  the steps taken to carry it out will he specified in detail at a later date.8. HOURS AND MANNING (RECOMMNDaTION ),This Recommendation is subsidiary to the Convention and applies only to countries which accept the Convention.      If the view which I have expressed above with regard to the Convention itself is accepted, it follows that the Recommendation is unacceptable to His Iviajesty&apos;s Government0The Minister of Labour and the Minister of Health (who is concerned particularly with Item 5 above) agree with the conclusions arrived at in this Memorandum.O.F.G. S.of Trade. October,  1937.
