THIS DOCUMENT&quot;IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.)3 E C R E T.(Cabinet 32 (37) Conclusion 9) the Cabinet had under consideration a Note from the President of the Board of Trade covering a Memorandum by the Secretary for Mines (CcPo 196(37)) which reported that a deadlock had been reached in the negotiations with the Royalty Owners on the question of the vesting of the property in advance of paymento      The Royalty owners contended that the Govern-ment&apos;s scheme for carrying out the valuation was impract-impracticable and claimed that they could produce an alternative scheme.      They were not, however, willing to divulge their scheme except on the footing that the Government were prepared to meet them on the fundamental question of the vesting date.2. At this stage, it will be rememberedj, the position was further complicated by the submission to the Govern-ment, with the support of the Royalty owners, of a scheme devised by Lord Hastings, which claimed to provide for &quot;unification&quot; under public control without the necessity for expropriation.p. P.   54-0 (57).CAB INSCOMMITTEE ON THE ORGANISATION OF THE GOAL INDUSTRY&quot;.&quot;SIXTH   REPORT,At their meeting on the 28th, July, 1937,This scheme was considered by the Cabinet and rejected.
3. The Cabinet then instructed the Chancellor or tnaExchequer and the President of the Board of Trade,  and the Secretary fs-r Mines to consider the possibility of reaching an agreed compromise with the Royalty owners,,4a As the result of discussions which have since takenplace with the negotiating sub-committee of the Mineral Owners&apos; Joint Committee, the Secretary for Mines has reported to us that a plan has now been evolved which represents the furthest that the sub-committee are prepared to advise their principals to go.    A summary of this plan is set out in the Appendix to our Report.So We are satisfied that the Government must carry intoeffect their policy of the unification of coal royalties under public ownersnip and control,  and it is obvious that the co-operation of the Royalty owners would greatly facilitate the passage of what must in any case be very complicated and diffi-eult legislation.      V/e have,  therefore,  carefully considered the plan referred to,  and though it is not free from difficulty, we recommend the Cabinet to accept it as the best way of meeting the Royalty owners1  objections to our original proposals.6. Our recommendation is, however,  subject to certain im-portant reservations.    First, as to the financing of the scheme. It is essential that the Treasury should first ascertain whether the financing of the scheme under this new plan is practicable, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer Is engaged in -consulting his advisers as to the possibility of issuing such a lean, having regard to our loan programme for defence and the general financial situation.    Our growing commitments for de-fence and the altered conditions in the City add to the difficul-ties of the contemplated operation.    As stated above, It is realised that the acquisition of the royalties by the best possible plan must continue to be part of the Government! s programme,
bat the plan now pat forward involves a gap of at least 4 yearswouldbetween the passing of the Act and the day on which the property/ pass to the Coal Commission.      This raises most important questions concerning the time at which the purchase money could be raised, and it has to be decided whether it is preferable that (a) the loan (probably a boat  70 millions in all) should be issued at or about the time of the passing of the Bill into law,- or whether (b) it should be possible, and preferable, to postpone the operation for (say) three to four years.7..     In the event of course (a) being decided upon, we recommend that the Royalty owners should be informed that the Government must insist on the modification of paragraph (5) of the plan, so as to empower the Coal Commission at any time after the &quot;valuation date&quot; to make advances on account of compensation to any owner, whether he is willing to accept it, or not.This provision would be the Government&apos;s answer to any criticism that the compensation money was being raised long &quot;before it was wanted,8.      Apart from the major issae of finance, we also recommend that an attempt should be made to get the plan modified so as to provide that proposals by the Commission to vary or rearrange the leases of a particular area- could not be held up by the condition contained in paragraph 4(b) of the plan beyond a period of say, 6 months.      This would obviate the possibility of deliberately obstructive tactics by individual owners, and we consider 8ach a provision very desirable.      We do not, however, saggest that it need be regarded as a vital condition of the Government&apos;s acceptance of the plan.Signed on behalf of the Committee, OLIVER  STANLEYChairman.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1. October 15th,  1937.
APPENDIX.Summary of Scheme referred to in Paragraph (4) of the Report.1.     The Act would prescribe a &quot;valuation date&quot; being the 1st January,  or the 1st July, not earlier than six months from the passing of the Act; 2.      (a) Each coal property would be valued for compensation as at this day, and (b) each present owner would be placed in the same position as if he had on that date entered into a contract to sell his coal-property (as defined in the Act) to the Goal Commission, the purchase to be completed on the &quot;appointed day&quot;; (Thus, during the interim, the Royalty Owners would receive the royalties and profits and would manage the property, but in so doing would have to show the same regard to the interests of the Commission as a trustee in relation to trust property.) 3.      The Act would prescribe the &quot;appointed day&quot; (the Royalty Owners&apos; Sub-Committee suggest 3-g- years after the &quot;valuation day&quot;) on which the property would pass to the Coal Commission; 4.      At any time after the valuation day,  the Commission would have power to vary or rearrange the leases of an area as if the property in question had already vested in them, subject to the conditions:(a) that each owner so affected would thereafter until the appointed day have the right to receive as income from the Commission the same sums ashe would have received under his lease if the Commission had not &quot;intervened&quot;;    and(b) that no such variation or re-arrangement could be so made until all sums due under (a) had been settled by agreement or, in default of agreement, by arbitration.
The Commission would have power at any time after the valuation day to make advances on account of cornpensa-tion to any owner who was willing to accept it, and on terms to he agreed with the owner in each case; Any compensation outstanding on the appointed day would carry interest therefrom.
