MIDDIS ..FAST* (Previsus ,Pap,erNo*  Q. 0. 3. 650). FJjS^pRT^At our 218th Meeting on the 18th October, 1957, we. had under consideration two telegrams from the Naval Commander--in-Chief, Mediterranean, dated the 16th October, 1957, addressed to the Chief of Naval Staff, and a telegram from His Majesty&apos;s Charge dlAffaires, Egypt, addressed to the Foreign Office of the same date (attached as Enclosures Nos* 1, 2 and 5).The local Commanders of the three Services (who are at present assembled in Egypt under&apos; instructions of the Chiefs of Staff to examine detailed plans, based on the assumption of a sjLngle-handed war with Italy) have ex-pressed concern at the deterioration in the international situation, and, in particular, at the despatch of Italian troops to Libya and the intention of the Italian Government to appoint Signor Parini as the Italian Minister in Egypt. They propose certain immediate measures to strengthen our position in Egypt, which may be briefly summarised as follows: --- (i)    The despatch of a complete anti-aircraftbrigade, and preferably of a fighter squadron in addition, from the United Kingdom..(ii)    The despatch of the aircraft carrier H.M. S. &quot;Glorious&quot; to Alexandria or the retention of her aircraft there.
(iii)     To approach the Egyptian Government with a view to an.immediate move of Egyptian troops to Mersa Mat rub. and the establishment of net defences and the mounting of guns at Alexandria.(iv)     The authorisation of the GeneralOfficer Commanding to move British troops to Mersa Matruh and Suez at his discretions and the placing of Mersa Matruh in a state of defence by the building-up of reserves of stores and the supply of anti-gas and water supply equipment.(v) The establishment of dumps of petrol and-bombs for Air Forces operating in the Western Desert.(vi)     The placing of a squadron in Iraqat short notice to reinforce Egypt.We are sympathetic towards the anxieties of the local Commanders charged with the responsibility of the security of Egypt in view of the existing paucity of resources available in that country.     In particular, the provision of anti-aircraft defences and fighter aircraft, all of which are at present deficient, appears to us to be eminently desirable in principle with a view to the establishment of confidence in Egypt and the stabilisation of the situation in the Eastern Mediterranean.In this connection the proposal of the Commander-in-Chief Mediterranean to land aircraft from GLORIOUS in Egypt is not recommended as apart from administrative objections it is most undesirable to use up these ship-based aircraft against must faster and more heavily armed land-based aircraft.     GLORIOUS is also due for refit and recommissioning.     The dockyard programme has been adjusted to take her in hand shortly and the crew, having
completed their term of foreign, service, are expecting to return to the United Kingdom this month. Her retention could only he justified on the grounds that it was necessary for the Mediterranean Fleet to he at more immediate state of readiness for war against Italy.It will he observed that the recommendations of the local Commanders are based on their assumption that the international situation has considerably deteriorated during the last few days.From the purely strategic point of view we do not consider that the military situation has greatly changed from that which existed at the end of July.      It will be recalled that at the 4th Meeting of the Defence Plans (Policy) Sub-Committee on the 23rd July, 1937, the Prime Minister emphasised the importance of doing &quot;nothing which could arouse Italian suspicions, or be construed as provocative.&quot;     It was on this account that the Admiralty were authorised to despatch to the Mediterranean the nets, which would be required at Alexandria in the event of an emergency, and an ammunition ship, on the distinct understanding that these steps were to be taken as unobtrusively as possible.     At the 298th Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence on the 39th July, 1937, the War Office were similarly authorised to take immediate but unobtrusive steps
to &quot;build up their reserves of supplies and stores so as to enable the garrison of Egypt to operate for a period of two months.These measures were taken largely as a result of the announced intention of the Italians to despatch three Metropolitan Divisions to Libya as part of its permanent garrison.     This announcement by Italy had been made as long ago as the 10th April last.     The only new factor which has arisen is that instead of the permanent garrison of Libya being one white corps of three Divisions, it now appears that it is to consist of two Corps, each of two Divisions. The total numbers of white troops in Libya, however, will not greatly exceed the combined total of the three Divisions whose despatch was originally announced, and the white troops which were already present in the country.There are two more reasons why it appears to us unnecessary to view with undue alarm this divergence from Italy&apos;s original announcement as to her intentions regard-ing the strength of the garrison in Libya.     In the first place it has been stated that the troops in Libya, owing to the favourable training facilities afforded by the colony, are to be considered in future as part of the Metropolitan Army, and we see no reason for not accepting this statement.     In the second place as far as our information goes, the formations now arriving in Libya are .not up to strength nor equipped for major operations over a difficult terrain   such as would be
involved in a land attack upon Egypt,      The onlyforces immediately available for attack upon egypt would therefore be air forces, which are not atpresent stationed in Libya in sufficient force for thepurpose, though they could bo flown there very rapidly and aerodromes exist for their accommodation.Aggression by air forces unsupported by ground troopsseems to us extremely unlikely.As regards the political situation, we areinformed that the Foreign Office consider that a general increase in tension in the Mediterranean has taken place during the last two months, due to developments in connec-tion with the Spanish situation.      The purely political aspects of this question are not matters which are within our province, but we presume that the situation in the Mediterranean is likely to develop one way or the other as the result of meetings of the Committee on Non-Intervention..-, in Spain, which are now taking place.If the negotiations in that Committee proceed satisfactorily, it appears to us that there may be a con-siderable relaxation in the tension between ourselves and Italy.     If, on the other1 hand, the negotiations break down, Italy may become apprehensive of stronger and more positive action on the part of ourselves, acting in co-operation with the French,     In this case she might conceivably take anticipatory counter measures by playing upon our fears for the security of Egypt,     Indications have not been lacking that she is well aware of our sensitiveness in this quarter since any sign of an intention to increase the garrison of Libya has always provoked an immediate reaction on our part.
ej iJ JLIn this connection it must he remembered that the despatch of Italian troops to Libya is a cause of anxiety to the French no less than to ourselves, since their colony of Tunis no less than Egypt can be threatened from Libya.      The recent transfer of Italian troops from the Yugoslav to the French frontier may well have been part of the same policy.At the same time, it is important not to lose sight of the fact that Italy herself has her own anxieties and diffi-culties.      Serious disturbances have recently taken place in Abyssinia where she has at the present time some 70,000 troops at the end of a very vulnerable line of communication.      In Spain she has some 45,000 troops committed at the present time. Her internal economic and financial situation must give rise to serious concern.      In these circumstances, from a military point of view, it seems improbable that she would embark single-handed on offensive action directed against Egypt, particularly in view of the fact that her ground forces in Libya are at present unprepared for an operation of such magnitude and that the only immediate action which she could take would be from the air.So far we have been considering only the situation as it is affected by our direct relations with Italy and the immediate defence of Egypt against Italian aggression.      These consideration; however cannot be dissociated from the general international situation.      The transfer of any forces from this country must inevitably weaken our position vis-a-vis Germany.      The despatch of 24 guns and       searchlights to Egypt would at this moment reduce the number of guns and lights available for the anti-aircraft defence of the United Kingdom to   /        guns and . *w* lights.      If by any action on our part we should provoke an act of sudden aggression against us by Italy in the Mediterranean, we should have to face the possibility of Germany (whether by preconcerted collusion or otherwise) seizing the opportunity to pursue her ambitions in other parts of Europe,  thus possibly precipitating a world-wide war.      This possibility must always
*     remain our greatest danger, and we have always considered that we should take no action which would result in a diversion of our limited resources from our main objective which is the     ^222security of this country against German aggression.      This consideration applies with especial force at the present time when our total defensive resources are still far below the level required for fulfilment of our defensive liabilities.      Conse-quently the decision whether or not to strengthen our anti-aircraft defences in Egypt depends largely on whether the Government consider that the risk of an extension of trouble from the Mediterranean to Northern Europe can be disregarded.It is for this reason that we have frequently referred to the desirability, from the military point of view, of the restoration of our former friendly relations with Italy.      In July 19365  for example, we reported^ as follows: -&quot;Prom the strategical point of view the first desideratum is a secure Mediterranean.      This involves, as the primary consideration,  the restoration of our former friendly relations with Italy.&quot;Again,  the Review of Imperial Defence^ which we prepared inFebruary 1937, for use at the Imperial Conference, included thefollowing passages:-55 55 55 h&quot;Better relations with Italy should be our constant aim&quot;. and later in the Review:-55 55 55 K&quot;Thus our sea communication through the Mediterranean can only be made really secure, either by maintaining friend-ship with Italy, or by establishing ourselves in such military strength in the Mediterranean as would permanently deter Italy from embarking on war against us.&quot;In a recent report on Anglo-Italian relations^ westated with regard, to. the above quotations: -&quot;We have been reinforced in the convictions expressed in the above quotations by the detailed examinations which we have.recently conducted into plans for possible wars. The result of these examinations has been to make it abundantly clear that the embarrassments and dangers to which we should be exposed, in the event of war with either Germany or Japan, will be multiplied by the possibility of a hostile Italy.&quot;h   Enclosure 2 to C.I.D-Paper No.1261-B, paragraph 4(a). fi   C. 1.1).Paper no.1305-B, paragraphs 50 and 67. C.I.i&quot;).Paper No. 1347-B, paragraph 5.
We have despatched an interim reply to the telegrams from the Naval Commander-in-Chief dated 16th October, a copy of which is attached as Enclosure 4 to this Report.We now ask for an early decision as to whether any action should be taken to carry out the recommendation of the local Commander-&quot;3&quot;    In this connection the time factor is all important.      Prom the time when a decision is taken to despatch reinforcements from this country to the time when their presence will become effective in Egypt, a period of about six weeks must be allowed.      This factor particularly affects the first of the recommendations of the local Commanders that an anti-aircraft brigade should be despatched from this country;      The other measures proposed are concerned with forces and resources available in or near Egypt at the present time,  and could be implemented more rapidly.SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS.Our conclusions may be summed up as follows:-(i) The provision of fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft defences in Egypt is in itself eminently desirable and would be a valuable factor in establishing confidence in Egypt and stabilising the situation in the Eastern Mediterranean, but in present conditions cannot be considered independently of the international situation as a whole.(ii) Prom a purely military point of view we are aware of no new factor in the situation which leads us to consider that the military situation is such as to justify a change in our existing&apos; instructions-, -that no obtrusive measures should be takenin connection with the defence of Egypt or in the projected movements of the Fleet,(iii) We note the opinion of the Foreign Office that the political situation in the Mediterranean at the present time is such as to justify further measures to increase the security of Egypt against Italian aggression.      But we presume that the pos.ition is likely to develop one way or the other as the result of the meetings of the Committee on Non-intervention in Spain now in progress.
(iv)    Italy&apos;s present commitments and pre-oecupations in Abjrssinia and in Spain, her adverse economic and financial position and the unpreparedness of her ground forces in Libya,  at the present time, for offensive operations in the Western Desert, make it improbable that she would embark single-handed on offensive action directed against Egypt0(v)    The despatch of any forces from this country must inevitably weaken our position vis-a-vis Germany and we have always considered that we should take no action which would result in a diversion of our limited resources from our main objective which is the security of this country against German aggression,(vi)   We have despatched an interim reply to the Local Commanders--in-Chief in Egypt (Enclosure No.4)., but a decision of the Cabinet is now required on the following points;-(a)    Has the political situation vis-a-visItaly deteriorated at the present time, or is it likely to do so in the immediate future as a result of a breakdown in the negotiations of the Committee of Non-intervention in Spain, to such an e xtent as to warrant a departure from our present instructions for taking no obtrusive measures for the additional security of Egypt-/(b)    If the above is the case,(l)&quot;should authority be given to the Local Commanders to take all the measures possible with the existing resources in or near Egypt, i.e. those referred to in Paragraph 2 (ii)  to (vi) above;(2)  should forces be despatched from the United Kingdom at the cost of weakening - our   anti-aircraft defence at home in the event of German aggression or an extension of trouble in the Mediter-ranean to northern Europe in such degree as to menace the United Kingdom.(vii) Prom the time when a decision is taken to despatch reinforcements from this country to the time when their presence will become effective in Egypt, a periods in time of p-aaca P of about six weeks must be all&quot;, wed-,; (Signed)  CHATFTELDRaHoHAINING(for CIoGoSo.)RoEoCPEIRSE(for CoAaSo)Whitehall GardensP Sofilo19th Octobers 195&apos;76
Copy of a Telegram front the Comrnander-in-Chief, Mediterranean (No. 127) dated 16th October, 1957, tothe Admiralty.PERSONAL for First Sea Lord and for C.I.G.8. and C.A.S.2.     Local Commanders held their first meeting this Saturday forenoon and were in agreement that as international situation appeared to have deteriorated considerably during last few days it was desirable that a report should be made now on steps which should be taken immediately to strengthen armament   position vis-a-vis Italy should His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment be in agreement with our appreciation of the situation. 5.     We are aware that- the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government has been that German menace has been considered greater than that from Italy but it is for consideration whether Italian attitude generally, the massing of troops in Libya and information contained in telegrams No. 552 and 555 from British-Minister to Mr. Eden do not at least temporarily call for special measures being, undertaken for the defence of Egypt.4.     The outstanding deficiency is the total absence of anti-aircraft guns and searchlights in either Egypt or Palestine, and we would Urge most strongly that a complete anti-aircraft brigade should be sent out now. 5.     Naval situation.      The present distribution of ships is generally favourable for opening moves as set forth in Interim appreciation J.P.255.      If H.H.S. REPULSE were sent to Gibraltar the two Battle Cruisers, one Mediterranean and one Home Fleet Flotilla would be available for escorting .H.M.S. FURIOUS with fighter aircraft for Egypt.    The remaining forces in Aegean
could be moved to Egypt for protection of Canal and Alexandria, Net defences in British ship THISTLEGARTH and H.M.S. PROTECTOR and ammunition in A. 3.1.8. CHURRiJCA are now in Eastern Medi t e rranean.6. The cuestion of ILL:.3. GLORIOUS requires immediate consideration&apos;.     The present arrangement is that H.M.S. GLORIOUS should leave Malta for United Kingdom on 25th October with three Torpedo Spotter Reconnaissance and all her fighter air-craft,  the remainder being disembarked at Malta.      If the situation is considered serious it is recommended that II.: .S. GLORIOUS should proceed to Alexandria forthwith which would allow two alternatives according to development of the situation.      (a)    If delay in arrival of H.II.S. GLORIOUS in United Kingdom can be accepted then H.K.S. GLORIOUS should retain her aircraft on board,      (b)    If U.I.I.S. GLORIOUS must adhere to her present programme then all her aircraft to be disembarked in Egypt,      If the latter course were adopted the ail1 situation might be further strengthened by sending out H.M.S. COURAGEOUS to replace H.M.S. GLORIOUS.7. Military situation.      As regards precautionary measureson land the General Officer Commanding is of opinion that in view of changed situation in Italian preparations in Libya, paragraph 26 of Appendix A to General Staff War Office Note No.l on the situation in the Middle East in the event of a unilateral war with Italy and importance of forestalling the Italians at Matrun, the following immediate action should be taken.3, Firstly he should be given authority to approach egyptian government in conjunction with Eirfbassay with a view to (a) moving forthwith Egyptian troops as garrison to Matrun in order to restore and maintain defences at that place (b) obtain their agreement to establishment of coast defences ex TillSTLEGARTH at Alexandria.      Secondly he should be given
&quot; 5 &amp; v At fauthority to move British troops to Matruh and Suez at his discretion and to establish at once at former place a depot to contain approximately 14 days supplies and s tores of all natures. Thirdly he considered immediate despatch of anti-gas stores and of at least one portable distilling plant for use at Hatruh to be essential.9, Air Situation.   An essential emergency precaution is to lay down supplies of petrol and bombs in western desert.     Air Officer Commanding Middle Bast requests authority to proceed at once with construction of dumps starting at Mersa Matruh. 10,       In view of deterioration in the Palestine situation with the possibility of having to reinforce that country by numbers 6 and 33 squadrons A.O.C. Middle East considers one Vincent Squadron in Iraq should now be placed at short notice to reinforce Egypt.11.       Concerning proposal to garrison searchlights and anti-aircraft guns referred to in paragraph 4 above it would be most advantageous to have oh fighter squadron sent to Egypt before outbreak of hostilities.12. A copy of this telegram has been handed to British Minister who is telegraphing his views to Foreign Office.16C3/16.

October, 1957&apos;&quot; to&quot;&quot;the&quot;&apos; inequality.personal for First Gea Lord.i*flien we conmeiiced our discussion this morning there was a general feeling that international situation might develop unfavourably in the near future and it soon became apparent that there was a considerable state of uirorewareducss in certain directions.      I therefore suggested and General Officer Commanding and Air Officer Commanding&apos;concurred that it was desirable to suggest certain immediate action as contained in my 1603 16th October.      &apos;ve are now considering interim appreciation J. ?.  233 but it was immediately apparent that it was essential to have much more detailed information than that available hero as to what fast and slow convoy transports contain.      General Officer Commanding has wired to War Office for the information which I hope will be sent immediately as otherwise our deliberations will be held upFirst Lord......nas seen my 16 03   16th October.0003/17.
*Bi?      f Copy of a telegram from air. Kelly (Alexandria)  (No. 568) dated 16th Octoper.  1957,  to the Foreign Office.Commander-in-Chief&apos;s most secret telegram to Chiefs of Staff October 16th.I very strongly support general principle underlying service recommendations, namely,that any measures contemplated for serious emergency should he anticipated as far as possible and as soon as possible.2. I consider specific proposals in Commander-in-Chief&apos;telegram should present no local political difficulty though I understand proposed anti-aircraft units and pilots for additional aircraft might increase total personnel of land and air forces respectively above treaty limits. 3. Should this be so there are two courses open (a) ifexcess is very small say nothing to Egyptians (b) if excess is important inform the Egyptian Government of measures in progress stating if circumstances require that in opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government apprehended international emergency exists. 4. From various recent conversations with Makram and Nahas1-asha I feel they are in a mood in which they are unlikely to raise objections.      If we adopt course (a) and the Egpytian Government themselves enquire what is numerical effect of reinforcements when they arrive I should admit the fact after verification but say excess was so trifling that it had not been realised,5. As regards movement of Egyptian troops to Mersa Matruhreferred to in paragraph 8 Nahas Pasha informed me at lunch to-day that head of military mission had this morning advised
the-Minister of War in the same sense.     Prime Minister said he approved hut desired opinion- of the General Officer Commanding. As regards coast defences I understand heads of services will px-opose Egyptians should he asked to take over coast defences Alexandria and iviersa Matruh and that they should be lent guns now with naval mobile base in Alexandria harbour on lines proposed in your telegram ITo. 459.6. If as I hope discretion for movement   of Britiah troops to Matruh and Suez be given the General Officer Commanding it will clearly be advisable to keep the Egyptian Government fully informed beforehand although under strict terms of treaty there is no limitation oh&quot; movement of British forces pending move to Canal Zone.
