THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1937. ,SECRET- Copy No.     4 iCP. 209 (37).CABINET.FOREIGN SECRETARIES SPEECH FOR THE ASSEMBLY OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS : GENERAL ECONOMIC SITUATION AND REPORT OF THE RAW MATERIALS COMMITTEE.Memorandum by the Secretary of. State for Foreign Affairs.I AM circulating to my colleagues, for their consideration and observations, a portion of the speech which I propose to make at the Assembly of the League of Nations, probably on the 14th or 15th September; this part deals with the general economic situation and with the Report of the Committee for the Study of the Problem of Raw Materials. It has been prepared after interdepartmental con-sultation with the Treasury, Board of Trade, Colonial Office and Dominions Office.I wish to call special attention to paragraphs 21 to 26 of the draft, which embody the proposal to withdraw preferences at present granted to imports from the United Kingdom by certain tropical African dependencies. The paragraphs have been placed in brackets, as the matter is not one which has been before the Cabinet, though it was down for the agenda on the 23rd June, nor have Ministers had an opportunity of giving their considered views.The suggestion was first made at the meeting of the Foreign Policy Com -mittee of the Cabinet of the 16th June. The tentative conclusion reached at this discussion was embodied in the following formula :-&quot; That His Majesty&apos;s Government should announce, at the first suitable opportunity, their willingness to abandon all preferences to the United Kingdom in their Tropical African Colonies, provided that other African Colonial Powers are prepared to make some appreciable contribution to the lowering of tariff barriers or preferences in colonial markets.&quot;There are various difficulties in connexion with this suggestion, which are fully set forth in a note which I attach as Annex 1 to this paper. On the other hand, the offer as defined in my speech is very carefully safeguarded. It would, if implemented, involve a very small volume of trade; and at the same time it would be an earnest of our practical desire to remove trade barriers and a definite con-tribution on our part in response to the recommendations of the Raw Materials Committee, of which we were the originators. If we do not make this offer there is very little left to show.I have also annexed to this paper some notes on various points covered in my paragraphs on the general economic situation which have been prepared in the competent Departments for the general guidance of the United&apos;Kingdom Delegation at the forthcoming Assembly of the League..     . ,...... ,..?. , . ; .; . ,A.

draft of Speech to be made by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs at the League Assembly at Geneva; Section dealing with (a) General Economic Situation; (b) United Kingdom arid United States Trade Relations; (c) Report of the Committee for the Study of the Problem of Raw Materials.THE economic history of the past year is not discouraging; and if, as is so often said, economic prosperity is the best guarantee for political peace, the past year has seen considerable progress. The disastrous fall of commodity prices which marked the onset of the crisis has been definitely reversed. Production has increased rapidly in many countries, including the United Kingdom. The members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, together with the countries whose currencies have been linked to sterling, also the United States, have been following a policy of cheap money, readjustments of exchange rates, avoidance of any deflationary tendencies^ avoidance of exchange controls and so forth. The result has been not merely to restore a very considerable degree of prosperity in the United Kingdom and the United States, but to turn conditions in the primary producing countries from one of deep depression to one of flourishing trade. A similar policy adopted much later has succeeded equally well in Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland.2. International trade has lagged behind the pace of domestic recovery; but the high hopes which we held this time last year that the Tripartite Currency Agreement would mark a fresh stage in the world&apos;s revival have not been wholly falsified. Trade barriers have not fallen in the way we have wished; but inter-national trade has increased both in quantity and in value as we learn from the admirable economic reviews published by the League; and important contribu-tions have been made to the freeing of trade, and thereby, so I firmly believe, to a more wholesome political atmosphere.3. First of all there has been the Three-Power Declaration itself, made by the United States, United Kingdom and French Governments, and supported by Belgium, Netherlands and Switzerland. This declaration not only laid down the basis for currency co-operation, but affirmed the importance which the Governments attached to the progressive relaxation of the present system of quotas and exchange controls with a view to their abolition. As a consequence of this affirmation, the Belgian Prime Minister undertook his enquiry into the possibility and practicability of progress in this direction, and instructed that distinguished economist, M. Frere, to assist him in this important and constructive task.4. A notable support to the principle of freer trade was given by the Powers signatory to the Oslo Convention in the agreement which they reached on the 28th May.  I welcome the ideals which inspired this Agreement.5. A similar ideal the ideal of peace and prosperity through economic interdependence has inspired the work of the League as shown in its excellent economic intelligence service, and, above all, in the work of its Economic and Financial Committees.6. I shall refer later to the report of the Committee for the Study of the Problem of Raw7 Materials; but here I wish to note, in passing, the report of another committee, that on nutrition. This enquiry has stimulated great interest in a most important subject, both in Geneva and in those individual countries which have already set up National Nutrition Councils. This movement for better, cheaper and more varied and abundant food should lead towards a reduction of trade barriers, and towards improved standards of living-which is the soeial synonym of what we call prosperity in the economic and peace in the political field;7. The Government of the United Kingdom believe that they have made no small contribution to the maintenance of international trade during these recent years of crisis.8. The United Kingdom import market, which is by far the largest import market in the world, has been kept open to an immense range of raw materials, food-stuffs, semi-manufactured and wholly manufactured goods. From 1933 onwards the value of our imports has steadily increased, and is still increasing.
In the first half of 1937 they had increased by about 20 per cent, over 1936, both from foreign and from Empire countries. On the assumption that in the second half of the year imports continue at the same level as in the first half, we should have total imports, valued at nearly  967 million: When compared with 1932, the year of the Ottawa Agreements and the first full year of tariff protection, this represents an increase of nearly 38 per cent, in total imports. This may be regarded, I consider, as a real contribution to the prosperity of international trade, and as convincing proof that our economic policy. is not narrow, or exclusive, or self-sufficient.-9. Throughout this period it has been the constant endeavour of the United Kingdom Government to take whatever action has been open to them to assist in the removal of barriers to international trade. In the pursuit of this policy they have, during the last four years, negotiated bilateral agreements with a large number of foreign countries. It is not I think, presumptuous to claim that these agreements have helped not a little towards the general tendency to the improve-ment in international trade which is now becoming apparent, by stimulating trade directly between the countries concerned and indirectly by the generalisation of the resulting tariff reductions under the most-favoured-nation clause.10. The second, great import market is that of the United States; and it is a fact of the greatest importance that, under the leadership of President Roosevelt and Mr. Cordell Hull, the United States Government have during these recent years adopted a vigorous and consistent policy for the reduction of trade barriers. /11. The United States have so far made trade agreements with some sixteen countries and, as in our own case, the resulting tariff reductions have with few exceptions been generalised under the most-favoured-nation clause. It has been a factor of the greatest benefit to world recovery that during these critical years United States economic policy has been inspired by broad-minded conceptions of freer trade,12. Moreover, the United States policy, like that of the United Kingdom, is not inspired merely by commercial considerations. Mr. Hull believes that the breaking-down of trade barriers is in itself a direct and material contribution to peace; and conversely, that the retention of these barriers must lead to war. I think we all agree that there is a great deal of truth in this doctrine of economic appeasement; and I am sure we all appreciate the courage and patience which Mr. Hull has shown in not only preaching but practising his doctrine. As a result the United States Government have been able to make a very valuable contribution to international commerce and to the welfare of the world, and to give us great hope for the future.13. The United Kingdom and United States import markets are, as I have said, the two great import markets of the world. Together they represented last year very nearly 30 per cent, of the world&apos;s total import trade. An agreement, on a most-favoured-nation basis, between these two countries for the reduction jof customs duties would, I consider, be one of the most effective steps which we can take not only in our own interests but in those of the whole world. Exploratory discussions are at present being conducted between the United Kingdom and United States Governments to determine whether a basis can be found for the negotiation of such an agreement; and it is to be hoped that the common desire for so practical an achievement may make it possible to find such a basis.14. I shall now pass on to another matter which is one of the most important which the present Assembly have to discuss. I refer to the Final Report and Recommendations of the Committee for the Study of the Problem of Raw Materials. This enquiry has been of particular interest to His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom, since it was they who initiated it when my predecessor made his speech here in September 1935. They believed that the subject was one which had given rise to wide misconceptions and that an impartial enquiry would be useful on this account alone. They also thought that there might be adjustments and mitigations in the preferential character Of colonial systems which could make I a. icontr distribution--even1 though not : of -a &quot;dramatic character-to the general movement for the greater freedom of trade throughout tfhe&apos; world, and ^which might also; remove&apos; the-misgivings&apos;, of some: countries ithat [15806] .yr;/:. ...; k: . B 2
their interests were being discriminated against and their industries starved of their supplies. I therefore regret that certain countries who-have complained of their disadvantages in the past were unwilling to take part in this enquiry.15. The committee&apos;s report has done admirable service in. presenting the facts and figures of the. situation in ;a manner which should remove all misconception of the essential problem from the minds of those who study it.16. It will be observed in the first instance that the problem of access to raw materials is by no means merely a colonial problem; by far the greater amount of these commodities, which are loosely described as raw materials, is hot supplied to world trade from colonies, but from countries which are wholly independent. Then it is clear that in times of peace there are very few prohibitions on the export of raw materials from any country whether colonial or metropolitan to any market where they can be sold; and such prohibitions as do exist are of no great importance. As regards restrictions of exports, the most important are those connected with international regulation schemes, of which the report gives an interesting and important analysis. On the whole, it may be said that these inter -natiohal regulation schemes have acted beneficially, to world trade by organising supplies and stabilising prices; but, at the same time, the report points out the dangers inherent in such schemes and it makes useful suggestions on the subject. The report also, discusses the question of export duties which,- where they exist, do not appear to create a serious obstacle to trade. Nor does the committee attach great importance to the rare cases of Government monopolies. It also discusses a regime of concessions in connexion with the development of natural resources. It points out the difference in this connexion in the practice of colonial and similar Powers. It accepts as inevitable that metropolitan countries must normally enjoy certain advantages in the exploitation of such resources. It suggests that the Governments concerned should consider the possibility of modifying the advantages inherent in this position in order, as far as is possible, to meet the complaints of countries which are not similarly favoured, while at the same time bearing in mind the duties which they owe to the local inhabitants.17. It is clear, however, from the report that the real difficulty which some countries have found in obtaining their requisite supplies of raw materials does not arise from any obstacle to their export, but from the difficulties experienced in finding means for paying for them where trade is hedged about and canalised by exchange restrictions and clearing systems. This brings the enquiry back to the main problem of freeing international trade, and the report suggests a re-examination of the International Convention of 1927 on the Abolition of Import and Export Restrictions and Prohibitions. It would also welcome further action, whether bilateral or multilateral, which would tend to reduce tariffs, though recognising that tariffs are now a less formidable obstacle to trade than other restrictions, and it refers especially to preferential tariffs between metropolitan countries and their colonies and dependencies.18. The United Kingdom Government will give most careful attention to this report and its recommendations. There is certain action which they have already taken, and there is certain action which they will be prepared to take, and there is certain action which they cannot take in any circumstances. The principle of Imperial Preference must be maintained, and British colonial dependencies must be assured of a preferential market in the United Kingdom ^and other parts of the Empire.. In return for this it is reasonable that those dependencies which are free to do so should grant preferential treatment to Empire goods. The effect of such preferences granted by colonial dependencies is, I think, apt to be exaggerated. Only a small amount of trade, in relation to world trade as a whole, is involved, and the preferences in the colonies are only an acknowledgment of the labour and expense devoted to their development and maintenance, and of the value of the United Kingdom market for their products. Moreover, the main object of the duties in force in British colonial dependencies is to produce revenue.19. The United Kingdom Government have deliberately refrained from pressing the preferential system beyond a&apos;certain limited point; and I wish to point out, as an example of the moderation which has been deliberately practised, that when last year we became free to introduce a preferential system in Nigeria,
, which is our largest African colonial market, we did not do so; out of regard for the general interests of world trade and in the hope that our action might not be without influence to others. &apos; .^ ;1 20; In pursuance of the idea which prompted our policy in this respect, His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared, as part of the efforts now being made to effect economic and political appeasement arid to increase international trade by the lowering of tariff barriers and other obstacles, but without prejudice to the principle of colonial preference, to announce their readiness to enter into discussions with any Powers which may approach the United Kingdom Govern-ment for an abatement of particular preferences in non-self-governing colonial territories where these can be shown to place undue restrictions on international trade. This offer must, of course, be made subject to such reservations as may be necessary to secure reciprocal advantages to colonial products and to meet the competition of excessively low-cost producers.21. [There is one special colonial area of vast extent and of considerable economic importance, where the principle of international consideration has ruled ever since it first became a problem for the Powers at the Berlin Conference of 1877. Over a large part of this vast area I am alluding to tropical Africa-a regime of non-discrimination in customs matters, commonly known as an &quot; Open Door &quot; regime, applies by virtue of the Congo Basin treaties. It applies (among territories under British control) to Uganda, Kenya, Tanganyika, Zanzibar, Nyasaland, and a small part of Northern Rhodesia. It also applies to the Belgian Congo, to Ruanda-Urundi and to parts of various other colonial territories belonging to other Powers. The Congo Basin treaties preclude any form of trade discrimination.22. The same condition applies to the territories under B mandates in this area, which include, besides those already mentioned, the Cameroons and Togoland. But there are other parts of tropical Africa to which this &quot;Open Door&quot; does not apply.   In regard to these areas I have a further offer to make.23. As part of a general movement for the reduction of trade barriers and with special regard to the recommendations of the Raw Materials Committee, His Majesty&apos;s Government would on one condition be prepared to request their non-self-governing dependencies in tropical Africa to rescind all preferences. The one condition to which I have referred is that His Majesty&apos;s Government must be satisfied that other countries are making some appreciable contribution to the removal of obstacles to international trade. The offer must be conditional upon a real and general advance towards this end.24. This offer would affect the following British colonial territories : Nigeria, an important market into which, as I have said, preferences have not as yet been introduced in anticipation of this formal offer; the Gold Coast, the Gambia and Sierra Leone; British Somaliland and Northern Rhodesia.25. This means that in future there would be no tariff discrimination throughout the whole of the vast territories in British tropical Africa. To this offer I must, however, make two reservations, apart from the condition I have already laid down. The first reservation relates to the exceptional arrangements which Northern Rhodesia has made with Southern Rhodesia and the Union of South Africa arrangements which are more in the nature of a Customs Union than of a preferential system. The second relates to the quotas on certain textiles and one or two special duties on other articles imposed in view of the competition of excessively low-cost producers.26. As I have already said, His Majesty&apos;s Government do not for one moment admit that the preferences in British tropical Africa have been a material obstacle to international trade, nor have they any intention whatsoever of departing from the principle of Imperial Preference. The preferential element in our relations with our colonies has been greatly exaggerated. For this very reason, the surrender of our preferences in tropical Africa will, I think, make only a small difference in the distribution of trade-1 want to make this point quite clear and, of course, even if preferences are abolished, duties must remain in order to produce the necessary revenue. It is rather the principle involved in my present offer which, so His Majesty&apos;s Government believe, has both value and significance.   It is an affirmation of our belief that this great
continent of Africa should not be regarded solely as a reserve for national self-sufficiency, and that preferential systems should be applied with moderation and should not lead in the direction of an economy closed to all outsiders; This policy is, I am sure, the best for the welfare of tropical Africa, for the wider interests of metropolitan countries, and for the rest of the world.].27. In so far as the preferential element in the colonial system creates difficulties for other countries in obtaining their supplies of raw materials, His majesty&apos;s government propose these, offers [this offer] for their relief.28. As regards Government monopolies, and export prohibitions, restric-tions and duties, the report clearly does not call upon the United Kingdom Government to take any action for the freeing of trade, since our trade is already free. As regards the absence pf all discrimination in the granting of concessions for development of all kinds in the British Colonial Empire, the report has drawn attention to the fact that the one exception relating to petroleum resources will cease to exist next year on conditions of reciprocity. And I would like to point to the large and valuable foreign investment in British colonial and protected areas, notably in Malaya. This in itself is an indication that our door is open.29. I am not, in fact, impressed by the complaints of those countries who say that they are shut out from supplies of raw materials by the exclusive policies of colonial Powers, though, as I have said above, His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared, as regards the British Colonial Empire, to meet such complaints where they can be justified. But I am afraid that no modification of the British or any other preferential system can provide any adequate remedy for the grievances of certain States. Countries which by maintaining exchange controls have cut themselves off from the rest of the world must find themselves at a disadvantage in obtaining imports of raw materials and other things which they require.30. For the principal difficulties of these countries arise not in connexion with the supplies of raw materials, but in connexion with the payment for them. These countries have many very great economic difficulties to face; but those difficulties have been aggravated and overloaded by other difficulties which are due, first, to their internal financial policies and, secondly, to the programmes of armament and military expansion which they have been following. This is made abundantly clear in the committee&apos;s report.31. &quot; The difficulties in procuring a number of raw materials,&quot; I am now reading from the report, &apos;&apos; have been increased by the heavy expenditure onarmaments incurred by most countries.....   If these countries employ theirreduced supplies of foreign exchange available for raw materials primarily for purposes of armaments they may well have difficulty in obtaining the raw materials required for normal purposes.&quot;32. In a speech which I made in England towards the end of last year I said that the world would act wisely were it to turn from armaments competition to economic co-operation. I said that my country was anxious to see international conditions created in which all nations could have greater opportunities economically and could hope to raise their standard of life, and that if a lasting settlement of world difficulties could be reached, including the indispensable-sable condition of an arms agreement, our help would be willingly and indeed wholeheartedly given.33. I can only repeat to this wider audience what I said to my own country-men nearly a year ago; and I wish to appeal to a still wider audience while there is still time to reflect and to choose. It is the old, old choice of &quot;life or death, blessing or cursing.34. A country hedged in by exchange restrictions and thereby prevented from purchasing freely in the world&apos;s market must inevitably be reduced to a more cramped existence than a country where all things can be freely obtained. A country which devotes an undue proportion of its national income to armaments must deprive itself and its citizens of the good things of life in order to waste its substance on the implements of death.35. Vast expenditures on armaments must involve a reduction in the standard of living of the peoples concerned, and increasing financial and economic
burdens for the. State. Still less, of course, can economic difficulties be relieved by military adventures,&apos; which must accentuate those difficulties and lead finally to. general impoverishment, if not universal ruin. If.normal economic conditions are to be restored, there must first be agreement that this should be the objective of policy. The possibilities of economic action &apos;are circumscribed by the political situation; and if military considerations are to override economic requirements no programme of economic co-operation can be brought to fruition. If, on the other hand, countries are prepared to revise their policies with a view to promoting peaceful co-operation with the rest of the world, I believe that means could be found for dealing with the technical difficulties of the economic position and for restoring a condition of prosperity in which the problems of raw materials with many of our other problems would easily find their appropriate solution.

It was subsequently suggested by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, in a memorandum circulated to some members of the Cabinet, that various points required further consideration before any action was taken.4. The suggestion was made in order to provide a possible contribution on the part of the United Kingdom Government towards (1) A general movement for the reduction of trade barriers for instance, inconnexion with M. van Zeeland&apos;s enquiry. (2) A special effort towards the opening of colonial markets on a basis ofnon-discrimination (&quot; Open Door &quot;) in order to meet a probablerecommendation to this effect in the Report of the Raw MaterialsCommittee.(3) An indication to foreign countries and especially to the United States of America that our colonial trade policy is not rigidly exclusive and that we wish to avoid injuring their commercial interests.5. All these reasons appeal strongly to the Foreign Office, who have been apprehensive lest the change over from an open to a closed colonial empire may arouse the envy and ambition of foreign Powers, and may lead to a situation where we shall have to defend our empire by force. They believe that the escape from an eventual war for colonial possessions is to be found in the growth of a conception of colonies as an international trust, existing for the benefit of the world at large. An early stage in the growth of this conception is the equality of economic opportunity in colonies. They realise the practical difficulties, and the great differences of circumstance attaching to the case of each individual colony. They accept, therefore, the distinction which this suggestion draws between the tropical African colonies and the rest of the colonial Empire; and they believe that this distinction can be explained and defended on historical and other grounds.6. The Board of Trade would give way to a consensus of opinion, but from their own point of view feel no enthusiasm for the proposal. The colonial markets represent an assured asset for United Kingdom trade at a time when markets are not easy to win.   So long as quotas against cheap imports from Japan are
retained, no great damage should result from this proposal to our export trade to tropical Africa; and, for this reason, the Board of Trade would, if necessary, accept it. But they anticipate some outcry in this country, and if the proposal had extended to other colonial markets they would have definitely opposed it; for these are too precious to lose, and. they have some misgivings lest this modification of Our preferential system prove a prelude and a precedent for further surrender! They would dislike unilateral action; and if we adopt the proposal, they would much prefer that it should be part of a general scheme for lowering trade barriers in colonies and elsewhere, since then we could point to material&quot; advantages to be gained in return for our self-sacrifice.7. The Secretary of State for the Colonies is not in favour of the proposal. He sees the advantages from the Foreign Office point of view and he agrees that in its present form the proposal is administratively feasible. On the other hand he feels that we shall be making a gesture for which we shall obtain no adequate return, that we shall be giving away a counter which might be useful in negotiations with Germany, and that we shall be taking action which will be very much criticised in this country and in the colonies (some of whom themselves benefit by the preferences in the African colonies) without a corre-sponding advantage. There is so little material substance in the proposal -the trade which may possibly, over a period of years, go to foreign countries instead of to the Empire as a result of the change is put at  f million to  1 million that it seems to him disingenuous to make it contingent upon an &quot; appreciable&quot; contribution by other countries. The Secretary of State fears lest the old cry of &quot; perfide Albion &quot; should be raised again and we should be accused of once more leading Geneva down the garden path.8. There is one further point not without its importance. At about the same time as or shortly after, the Geneva speech is made a resolution will be introduced in the Ceylon State Council for the continuance of preferences in Ceylon. The President of the Board of Trade and he both attach importance to getting this resolution through for political as well as for economic reasons, and indeed have gone so far as to offer a relaxation of the quotas (imposed over the heads of the Ceylon State Council) if the resolution is passed. It will obviously be more difficult to get it through the Council if, a day or two before, His Majesty&apos;s Government have voluntarily renounced preferences in another important part of their Colonial Empire.9. In the first place the Cabinet are asked to indicate whether or not they approve the proposal in principle.  If they do, one or two further points arise.10. The non-self-governing Dependencies in tropical Africa are taken to mean1- the following : East Africa. Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika Territory, Zanzibar, Nyasaland, Northern Rhodesia, Somaliland.West Africa. Nigeria, Gold Coast, Sierra Leone, the Gambia. [Southern Rhodesia is not included.]Of these Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika, Zanzibar, Nyasaland and a small part of Northern Rhodesia are within the area to which the Congo Basin treaties apply. These treaties already preclude any form of trade discrimination. In West Africa Nigeria was until recently, and the Gold Coast still is, subject to treaty provisions which have precluded any form of tariff discrimination, except against countries having no most-favoured-nation rights (e.g., Japan).11. The only other Powers having possessions in Tropical Africa are Belgium, France, Italy and Portugal. There is also the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan which cannot be within the British preferential system. There is no preferential system in force in the Belgian Congo. The Italian and French colonies are very much a close preserve of Italy and France, except where France is bound by Mandate or the Congo Basin Treaties; in the Portuguese colonies the regime is somewhat more liberal. If, therefore, we are going to make any action by the United Kingdom conditional upon similar action by other Powers in Tropical Africa, we are going to ask Italy and France for a sacrifice much greater than our own. Under such conditions, therefore, our offer would hardly be taken seriously; and so far as it was taken seriously it would be an embarrassment and annoyance to those two Governments. If we are to make our offer,conditionally on, some measure of reciprocity, the Secretary of State for the Colonies has suggested (a) that the other Powers with Tropical African possessions should be, [15806] &apos;&apos; c   .   ,,&quot;
invited to take equivalent action either in Africa or outside it to reduce tariff barriers; or (b) that we should be satisfied that there was a general move towards the lowering of tariff barriers, the removal of preferences in Tropical Africa being a part of our contribution to the general improvement. The Colonial Secretary expressed a decided preference for the latter alternative.12. The draft has been prepared on the assumption that this view will be accepted.13. Tariff preferences are given to most goods coming from the Empire countries, in Somaliland, Northern Rhodesia, Gambia and Sierra Leone. The total imports of these four colonies was in 1936  4-6 million, of which  2-1 million or 46 per cent, came from the United Kingdom, and  1 - 5 million or 32 per cent, from other Empire countries.^)14. In the case of Nigeria and the Gold Coast there are no tariff preferences (though there are anti-Japanese discriminatory duties on certain other items in these colonies and in the Gambia), but there are quotas extended in the case of Nigeria to cover piece-goods of cotton and artificial silk from all foreign countries and not only Japan, thus guaranteeing the Empire countries the continuance of their present trade a very large part of the whole as well as any expansion of the market. In the Gold Coast the similar textile quotas have also been extended to all foreign countries, and, for treaty reasons, to British goods also. As they have the lion&apos;s share of the market the effect is almost equally beneficial to them. The existence of these quotas on piece-goods in Nigeria and the Gold Coast is an important fact since the trade is a large one, worth in 1936 some  5f million or 30 per cent, of the total trade of the two colonies. Of this total the United Kingdom supplied  4 million or 70 per cent., and other Empire countries  0-3 or 6 per cent.15. Import trade in cotton and artificial silk piece-goods is also limited by quota in Sierra Leone and the Gambia by quotas on Japanese goods only and in British Somaliland by quotas on all foreign goods.16. The total value of the imports into British Tropical Africa in which the Empire competes on equal terms with the foreigner was in 1936  26 million, of which the United Kingdom had  11-1 million or 43 per cent., and other Empire countries over  3 million or 12 per cent. Thus, both absolutely and also relatively to the total trade of the Tropical African Dependencies ( 36^ million), the trade which enjoys tariff preferences ( 3-6 million) is small. At the outside the trade which would pass from British to foreign hands as a result of the abolition of preferences might amount to  f million, and the change would only occur gradually over a period of years; this refers, of course, to the abolition of tariff preferences.17. It must be considered whether or not our offer if made at all is to cover quota preferences, which assure to the Empire a trade of some  5 million a year. Their abandonment, in Somaliland would have no great significance; the market is a small and special one. In West Africa, however, the market is substantial and rapidly expanding, and Manchester attaches considerable importance to it. The abandonment of all quotas would at once let in a flood of Japanese textiles. Any offer, therefore, which we may make regarding quotas must contain a reservation regarding imports from low-cost producers.18. This reservation would also cover the problem of Chinese competition which has been causing some anxiety to Manchester during the last year. Japan has no most-favoured-nation rights in West Africa; and Chinese rights consist in an obligation to give any colony most-favoured-nation treatment so long as that colony gives most-favoured-nation treatment to China. We are somewhat reluctant, for political reasons, to impose quotas on Chinese goods if not on those of other foreign countries, but we realise that it might be necessary, and if the Raw Materials Committee endorse a reservation regarding imports from low-cost producers this would assist us in meeting any possible Chinese complaint.19. Subject to this reservation, the Colonial Office would willingly see the quotas disappear, for they cause a great deal of administrative difficulty in the Colonies. There would also be advantages from the Foreign Office point of view in their removal, since the quotas are undoubtedly irksome to continental countries, notably the Netherlands, Italy, German and Czechoslovakia from all* The trade of the African dependencies has increased so much recently that these and all the following figures should be increased by something like a third to show the present level of trade.
of whom representations have been received. Manchester, moreover, frequently stated before the present quotas were introduced that they feared no competitors other than China and Japan. The President of the Board of Trade, however, feels that circumstances have altered recently Italian competition, for instance, is now increasing greatly and rapidly in other markets, such as Egypt (far beyond what was experienced before &quot;Sanctions &quot;), and if unrestricted new competition would in all probability also increase in West Africa and he would greatly prefer that no commitment should be made on this point. To do so would undoubtedly intensify opposition in this country.20. The draft has therefore been prepared on the basis that the quotas will be unaffected.21. There are rather special circumstances in Northern Rhodesia to be considered. By the United Kingdom-Canada Trade Agreement Northern Rhodesia is bound to give certain preferences to Canada. It would be necessary to get Canada to absolve her from these obligations. There should, perhaps, be no special difficulty on this score. The preferences involved are not of great importance; the total imports into Northern Rhodesia of the goods covered by them were only  143,000 in 1935, of which  37,000 came from Canada. As the gesture proposed is one which on general grounds is certain to appeal to the present Canadian Government, she would probably be prepared to waive her rights to these preferences. If the proposal is approved in principle she will be approached at once on this point.22. Another difficulty is the close trade relationship between Northern Rhodesia on the one hand and Southern Rhodesia and the Union of South Africa-on the other. Northern Rhodesia has Customs agreements with both and with Southern Rhodesia she has a large measure of free trade, the tariffs of the two countries having in the past been practically identical. Recently, it is true, there has been some divergence between the two tariffs and a new arrangement for the calculation of differences of duty has been made which should be capable of extension; but there would undoubtedly be considerable administrative difficulties, and Northern Rhodesia might lose some advantages both in Southern Rhodesia and the Union, if she gave no preferences to them. For these reasons there would certainly be the strongest opposition in Northern Rhodesia to action by His Majesty&apos;s Government which precluded her from retaining her special relation-ship with her two neighbours. It would, it seems, be most desirable to enter some caveat to exempt from the action proposed any special preferences granted by Northern Rhodesia to Southern Rhodesia or the Union.23. It must, of course, be made clear that there is no question of impugning the principle of Imperial Preference so vital to other colonies like the West Indies. It must also be made clear that there is no question of the surrender of preference in this country to any tropical African dependency as the result of the removal of preferences in them. Further, the removal of preferences to the United Kingdom implies the removal of preferences to other Empire countries also. In most of the Ottawa Agreements there is a clause providing that the Dominion in question shall not be bound to grant preferences to any colonial dependency which, not being precluded by international agreement from doing so, does not grant a preference to the goods of the Dominions. Consequently it will be desirable to obtain assurances from the various Dominions concerned that they will not, as a result of His Maiesty&apos;s Governments action, withdraw pre-ferences from Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Gambia, Somaliland and Northern Rhodesia. It is not, however, regarded as essential to obtain this assurance from the Dominions (other than Canada) before any announcement is made, since beyond the announcement no immediate action to remove the preferences is contemplated.24. It is important that there shall be no permanent commitment similar to the Congo Basin Treaties which would bind our hands for all time and would so preclude dependencies from taking any discriminatory action which might later be found to be necessary in their own interests.Foreign Office, August 31, 1937.[15806]d
&apos; , annex 2.Notes for the Guidance of United Kingdom Delegates at the League of Nations Assembly : September 1937.   .........(1) M. van Zeeland&apos;s Enquiry.M. FRERE, M. van Zeeland&apos;s envoy, Has not yet completed his report; it may perhaps be ready before the Assembly or possibly M. van Zeeland may make some statement at the Assembly. (It seems that before any publicity is given to this report, M. van Zeeland may wish to discuss it with British, French and American experts with a view to drawing up a programme of possible action, but this is confidential.^ ;     ; ,Advance information as&quot; to the results of M. Frere&apos;s enquiries is not encouraging : while those responsible for the direction of economic affairs in some of the chief countries having exchange and import restrictions, including Germany and Italy, express the desire to get rid of the restrictions, it is clear that economic progress is waiting on the development of the political situation and not vice versa. In France the pressure of producing interests appears in present circumstances to have barred out any prospect of a relaxation of their extensive system of quotas. There is some evidence of a tendency in Europe to wait for the United Kingdom (and possibly the United States of America) to make a move in the economic field and/or in giving financial assistance, but it is doubtful whether either the United Kingdom or United States Governments are likely to provide economic or financial assistance to Germany or Italy or indeed whether those countries really desire i1^-until their Governments have definitely proved their &quot; will for peace.&quot; This is not the case; and this is the impasse into which M. van Zeeland&apos;s enquiry will probably lead.In the circumstances it seems undesirable for the United Kingdom representatives at the Assembly to say much about this enquiry (beyond some appreciation of. the trouble taken by M. Frere and M, van Zeeland) unless and until M. van Zeeland himself makes a pronouncement on the subject.King of the Belgians&apos; Letter.Meanwhile, the King of the Belgians, apparently On his own initiative and not on M. van Zeeland&apos;s prompting, has written to him suggesting the setting up Of an international committee of economic research. So far as economic difficulties and their remedies are concerned the facts are well known and further academic discussion is superfluous. The proposed Committee would merely provide a debating ground to which German and Italian representatives might repair more easily than to Geneva. This is no solution to the main question and would be disappointing if it were to be the sole result of M. van Zeeland&apos;s enquiry. If the proposed Committee can be connected with the existing organisations of the League and this is believed to be the King&apos;s intention-it may serve a useful purpose. However, the better plan, if it could be accomplished, would be to bring back into the League (or at any rate into the work of its technical organisations such as the Economic and Financial Committees) those important countries which are not at present participating in its work.Board of Trade, August 28, 1937.(2) Oslo Powers&apos; Convention.. . With the object of promoting the movement towards freer trade, a group of relatively low tariff countries, mostly standing in close relation with the United Kingdom market, signed this Convention at The Hague on the 28th May last. They are Belgium-Luxemburg, Netherlands (with Netherlands East Lndies), Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland. Countries in this group which have employed the quota system (Belgium, Netherlands) have undertaken to admit free of restriction a certain number of types of goods enumerated in an Annex to the Convention and also not to raise their duties on such goods; the other signatory countries have undertaken not to raise their duties nor to introduce fresh restrictions on other listed types of goods enumerated in another.Annex.   The
(3) Economic Committee&apos;s Report: International Economic Relations.This report will not be settled until a few days before the Assembly meets, but we have seen a first draft of the only part which is likely to be of general interest, viz., the section dealing with the present state of international economic relations.There are reasons to believe that in summary this section is likely to be somewhat as follows : It will be noted that the Tripartite Currency Declaration of September 1936 has so far failed to fulfil the hope that it would prove the starting point for more comprehensive action towards freeing international trade. There are two main reasons (1) that the readjustment of the French, currency has not yet produced the results expected of it, and (2) that the policy of Germany and Italy in maintaining exchange and quota controls remains essentially unchanged. True, there has been a resumption of economic activity which is gradually extending to most countries, but international trade has not fully kept pace with internal production and trade in the various countries. Quotas and exchange controls remain, owing to some extent to the drive towards self-sufficiency in certain countries. Moreover, the present resumption of activity is due in part to the rearmament in progress in many countries such expenditure is ultimately uneconomic besides aggravating the general sense of insecurity. In brief, the general&apos; situation is characterised by uneasiness and lack of equilibrium.Next the report will discuss methods by which progress could be made towards &quot;economic normalisation.&quot; Little is to be expected of purely autono-mous action by individual states and the bilateral method also has its limitations : can anything be hoped for from multilateral action? A rigid and binding multilateral agreement requiring specified steps to be taken according to a time-table to abolish exchange controls and quotas and to reduce high tariffs is unlikely to meet with wide acceptance. The report envisages a looser arrangement, e.g., a further declaration on the lines of the Tripartite. Currency Declaration which would be made by such -, countries as are willing to come into iV setting [15806] ^ d 2fixation of tariffs on the listed goods is extended automatically to all countries enjoying most-favoured-nation rights; as regards the quota benefits, these are being extended to this country (and to some other countries) by the countries concerned, i.e., Belgium and the Netherlands, in view of the favourable develop-ment of their trade with usr It is fortunate from our point of view that they did so, since otherwise some difficult questions would have arisen of our right to most-favoured-nation treatment, analogous to the difficulties encountered by the rather similar &quot; Ouchy Convention&quot; of 1932 between Belgium and the Netherlands. The method adopted in Agreements of this kind is open to serious question in that it fails to take account of existing most-favoured-nation Treaty obligations and, moreover, confronts countries that have not been parties to the negotiation of the Agreement with the dilemma either of participating in a scheme on which they have not been consulted and which may be quite unsuited to their situation, or else of seeing their goods discriminated against as compared with those of the signatories. Countries finding themselves in such a situation might well resort to retaliation, and a risk of friction and of opposed economic blocs would arise.  For these&apos;reasons we do not look with favour on the method.The objection is not wholly removed by the provision contained in the convention that other countries may come into it on terms to be agreed with the signatories, nor by the signatory countries&apos; declaration that it is their intention not to develop transactions amongst themselves to the detriment of others, but to make the new Agreement an instrument for facilitating the general expansion of trade (see Report of the Economic Committee of the League, Fourth-fifth Session, Document C.280 M.181, 1937).Further, the extent to which trade barriers are in practice reduced by the Oslo Powers&apos; Agreement appears small. Nevertheless, their object and intentions may be commended. It is, at any rate, of significance as showing the willingness of the Oslo countries to support any practical advance towards freer trade.Board of Trade, August 28, 1937.
out the principles to be followed in seeking economic equilibrium and the gradual removal of obstacles to trade. The participant governments would, it is suggested, declare their determination to do away first with industrial quotas except those guaranteeing the execution of international undertakings or justified by obvious dumping; to relax control over agricultural imports without prejudice to guarantees necessary to prevent the disorganisation of markets; to achieve greater stability in tariffs and to lower tariffs on goods not subject to quotas. They will also signify their intention to revise their clearing and payments agreements so as to give greater elasticity and assist towards the removal of exchange controls.Apparently it is contemplated that such a declaration would be followed by concurrent action in the various countries -not necessarily action concerted in detail to revise quotas, tariffs and clearing agreements. Perhaps this procedure is the least unhopeful if any large scale international action is to be attempted, but it may be seriously doubted (1) whether each country will not merely wait on the rest to take action, and (2) whether the position of Germany and Italy may not prove a stumbling-block. These two countries are not in a position at present to abolish their exchange controls and may even want to keep them as a means towards economic self-containment. In these circumstances are they (i) not to receive the benefits of any relaxation of quotas and tariffs by other countries ? That may lead to trouble and stiffen their attitude, or (ii) are they to receive the benefits from other countries without giving any quid pro quo ? It seems unlikely that a good many countries participating in the proposed concerted action would be prepared to go to this length.Thus we come back to the political difficulty of trying to dissuade Germany and Italy from going further in the direction of isolation and self-sufficiency and starting a move in the opposite direction. This is primarily a political rather thar. an economic problem.Question of His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s Attitude.There appears no reason why His Majesty&apos;s Government should oppose an experiment in concurrent action on the lines described above, assuming that the general reasonableness of our tariffs is admitted, but if it should not achieve any striking success, can we be said to have any policy which holds out hope of an improvement in international trade relations ? Such policy may be either (a) monetary and financial, and (b) economic.As regards (a) monetary and financial policy, the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations from 1931 and the United States of America from 1933 have been following a policy of cheap money, readjustments of exchange rates, avoidance of any deflationary tendencies, avoidance of exchange controls and so forth. The result has been not merely to restore a very considerable degree of prosperity in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, but to turn conditions in the primary producing countries (Australia and the Argentine, for instance) from the very depth of depression to extreme prosperity. A similar policy adopted much later has succeeded equally well in Holland, Switzerland and Belgium and it would have succeeded in France, but for artificial obstacles, forty-hour week, excessive wage increases, &amp;c), mainly of political origin.The countries, Germany, Poland, &amp;c, which prosperity has not touched are in the main exactly those countries which have gone on the opposite tack of keeping their exchanges high, keeping wages rigorously depressed, and defending their excessive exchange rates by every kind of device, such as exchange controls and quotas. Their troubles are not due to anything we have done, but to their own pig-headedness, and there is no monetary or financial change which we.are called on to make or can make to help them out. Their main hope now is that the rise in world prices generally, which we and the United States have brought about in face of the hindrances they have opposed to it, will float them gradually off the rocks.As regards (b) economic policy, His Majesty&apos;s Governments experience has led them not to hope for much from multilateral action, but they are convinced that, given favourable conditions, such as are how furnished by the rise in prices of primary products and the better equilibrium between those prices and the prices of manufactured goods, a great deal can be achieved by the method of bilateral agreements of which the benefits are generalised under the operation of the most-favoured-nation clause.
(4) League of Nations&apos; Nutrition Report.The Mixed Committee (Chairman, Lord Astor) on the Problem of Nutrition , was set up under a resolution of the Sixteenth Assembly in 1935 to study both the health and economic aspects of the nutrition problem. An interim report was presented to the Assembly of 1936; the final report has just been published. It will be presented to the Council of the League, and will become the subject of debate at the Assembly.The final report deals mainly with the economic and agricultural aspects of nutrition. It is divided into three parts. The first part consists of three short chapters, the first Introductory, the second dealing briefly with the significance of nutrition to human progress during the last century, and the third chapter is one of &quot; Summary and Conclusions.&quot; The second part consists of one chapter dealing with public health, and this is mainly a reproduction of the chapter entitled Nutrition and Public Health, from last year&apos;s interim report. The third part consists of five chapters, in which the nutrition problem, in its relationship to social, economic and agricultural questions, is discussed in great detail. The Committee anticipated that the first part would be the section of the report in which Governments, the Press and the general public would be mainly interested, and that the third part would be studied by persons specially interested in the technical aspects of economics, commercial policy, agriculture and social policy.The Committee point out that better nutrition means an increased demand for food-stuffs; and that if national agricultures are to provide sufficient quantities of, for instance, liquid milk, to enable the population to achieve an optimum standard of consumption, the result must be a marked increase in the demand for animal feeding-stuffs. This would partly be met by increased national production of cereals for animal feeding and partly by importation. It is also indicated that, as national nutrition policies develop, there will be an increased demand for the protective foods, and that so far as milk, fruit, vegetables and eggs are concerned, such products are more economically suited for production on the small-scale farms of Europe than are cereals, sugar or meat. As a result, the Committee looks forward to a gradual re-orientation of European agriculture to produce more of these protective and perishable foods and to some gradual decrease in the importance which European Governments at present attach to the production of some of the other great staples of inter-national commerce in agricultural products. The Committee points out that if this re-orientation of European agriculture is to make reasonably rapid progress, it will be necessary for Governments to give greater attention to the efficiency of agriculture. The view is expressed that the agricultural co-operative movement could play an important part in the change in the direction of greater reliance upon animal husbandry, fruit and vegetables. This, however, will require some capital expenditure on the part of peasant farmers, therefore the question of agricultural credit ought to be reconsidered in the light of the needs of nutrition policies. The Financial Committee of the League has already decided to place the question of international agricultural credit upon its agenda.It is pointed out that, so far as Eastern Europe is concerned, the present level of nutrition of the agricultural workers is frequently deplorable and that a change in the direction of mixed farming instead of reliance upon one or two cereal crops would lead to a marked improvement in the nutrition of the agriculturist himself.Attention is, drawn to the detrimental effect of extreme agrarian protection upon the standard of nutrition in certain countries and it is suggested that Governments should reconsider their agricultural tariffs, quotas and the like in the light of the nutritional needs of their own particular nations.  AlthoughMost-Favoured-Nation Policy.His Majesty&apos;s Government continue to regard the most-favoured-nation principle as. holding out the best hope of harmony and stability in international economic relations, whilst, nevertheless, being willing to consider concrete proposals for limited modifications and exceptions from the most-favoured-nation principle to meet special cases of* difficulty.Treasury and Board of Trade, September 1, 1937.
this Enquiry deals in the first instance with health and social matters, it is clear that it has economic and political implications.The aim of the enquiry is to promote improved choice and consumption of foods. This movement would lead in the direction of a reduction of trade barriers and especially of agricultural protection so that food-stuffs can be imported from the countries where they can be best and most cheaply produced. , It would enlarge the markets for the primary exports of food-producing countries; and this in turn would enable them to consume larger quantities of manufactured goods. Further, improved nutrition implies decrease of poverty and increase of education, in other words, improved standard of living, such as should be the watchword of social policy in this age of plenty in which we live.The enquiry may be criticised as academic; it has, however, been well carried through, and has found approval in a large number of countries. There is evidence of this. A majority of European countries as well as the United States and Australia have already set up National Nutrition Councils, as a result of the recommendations of the Committee. The enquiry points in a definite direction which the world must follow, unless human well-being is actually to recede, as seems to be likely in Germany and other countries where trade is least free.Then Nutrition Committee may be regarded as a first step towards encouraging Governments to take measures for improvement in standards of living.. To promote the work that has been thus begun the Assembly might decide to recommend the setting up of another body to consider what methods, national and international, should now be taken in this direction.Foreign Office, September 1, 1937.(5) United Kingdom Import Policy and Course of Import Trade.United Kingdom Imports.1.

On the assumption that in the second half of this year imports continue at the same level as in the first half, we should have for the full year 1937 total imports valued at nearly  967 million, and imports from foreign countries of over  567 million an increase over 1932 of nearly 38 per cent, in total imports and nearly 25 per cent, in foreign imports.These increases of imports may be regarded from every point of view as a real contribution to the prosperity of international trade, and as an illustration of the reasonableness , of the import policy pursued by His Majesty&apos;s Government.Board of Trade, August 31,1937.
(6) United Kingdom-United States Trade Discussions.Informal and exploratory discussions with the United States have been proceeding for nearly a year. The object of these discussions is to ascertain whether a basis exists for the negotiation of a United Kingdom-United States trade agreement.The main difficulty is the nature of the concessions the United States require from us. They have continued to insist, as a sine qua non of entering into negotiations, on important concessions on a range of agricultural products, most of which are the subject of commitments under our Trade Agreements with the Dominions and India.The United States proposals were communicated in full to the Dominion Delegations in London for the Imperial Conference and were subsequently discussed with each Dominion Delegation in turn, with the exception of the Australian Delegation, who felt unable to discuss the matter in advance of the Commonwealth General Election to be held this autumn.The results of these talks were then communicated to the Embassy at Washington as the basis for further discussions with the United States. The United States, however, have so far shown little inclination to agree to any modification in their list of &quot; essential &quot; requests and they have been adamant in their refusal to entertain any suggestion for compensating the Dominions in advance for any preferences that they might give up in the United Kingdom.In particular the United States seemed unable to appreciate the Canadian point of view and the difficulties with which the Canadian Government would be faced if they had to surrender part of the Canadian preferences in the United Kingdom without adequate compensation from some source. The special difficulty in the case of Canada is that these preferences were recently renewed in the United Kingdom-Canada Trade Agreement of the 23rd February, 1937, and that Canada alone of the Dominions already has a trade agreement with the United States.It soon became clear that little further progress was likely to be made in the endeavour to find a basis of negotiation for a United Kingdom-United States agreement unless there had first been an opportunity for an exchange of views at first hand between Canadian and United States representatives. Mr. Mackenzie King was accordingly approached on the matter. He was at first unwilling to make any move, but following on the submission to him of a written message from the Prime Minister the Canadian Government agreed to take steps to bring about a direct discussion with the United States authorities, and arrangements are now in course of settlement between the United States and Canadian Govern-ments for informal and confidential discussions between United States and Canadian officials. These discussions are unlikely to start for some weeks. The United States and Canadian Governments, while conscious of their own political difficulties, have not been so ready to appreciate the political difficulties of each other and it is to be hoped that these talks will pave the way to a closer under-standing of these difficulties.The present position of the United Kingdom-United States trade talks is thus extremely delicate, and any premature &quot; waving of caps &quot; would undoubtedly have unfortunate repercussions and would seriously prejudice the chances of finding a basis of negotiation. The United States Government and all Dominion Governments concerned are most anxious that nothing should be said in public at this stage about the course of the discussions, and it is therefore not possible to say more than that exploratory discussions are being actively pursued. In particular any public statement, except of the most guarded character, might have serious reactions in Australia on account of the pending elections.Board of Trade, September 1, 1937.
