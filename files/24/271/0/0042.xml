THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1937.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 242 (37).CABINET.RURAL HOUSING IN SCOTLAND.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland.AS my colleagues are aware, the general housing situation in Scotland is serious.2. When the Housing (Scotland) Act was before Parliament, Government supporters pointed out that it did not adequately meet the needs of rural areas. In response to this criticism the Government undertook that the whole question of rural housing would be examined by the Scottish Housing Advisory Committee. The Committee submitted their report early this year. They found that the general standard of housing in rural areas was extremely low, and they recom-mended important changes both in administration and in the law. The administrative changes recommended by the Committee have already been dealt with, and the legislative changes relating to the Housing (Rural Workers) Acts will be dealt with in a United Kingdom Bill which will be introduced later.3. Of the remaining main recommendations of the Committee requiring legislation, I should propose to accept the following : (a) In addition to the subsidies now given for slum clearance and to put an end to overcrowding, assistance should be given to County Councils to erect houses to meet the general needs of the agricultural population.(&amp;) County Councils should be empowered to give grants to owners to replace unfit tied cottages on farms occupied by agricultural workers, where it is clear that the workers must be housed on the farm. The Exchequer should meet three-quarters of the cost of the grants.(c) County Councils should be empowered to give grants to the owner occupiers or the landlords of certain classes of small agricultural holdings to enable them to replace unfit houses on the holdings. The Exchequer would meet three-quarters of the expenditure on such grants, except in the Highlands and Islands, where the Exchequer share would be seven-eighths.4. I also propose to accept certain minor recommendations of the Committee designed to improve the administration of the Housing (Scotland) Acts. These recommendations have been discussed with the Association of County Councils in Scotland, and I do not expect that they will arouse any controversy.5. The cost to the Exchequer involved by the proposed legislation depends on the extent to which County Councils are prepared to operate these proposals, and I should not propose to press County Councils to undertake programmes which would accentuate the present shortage of labour and materials. On this assumption, the annual burden on the Exchequer in the financial year 1938-39 will be negligible, and in the four succeeding financial years will rise from about  14,000 to about  70,000. If the Act were subsequently continued on the same [16016]
terms, at the expiry of the five-year period, the annual burden might eventually be increased by a sum not exceeding  50,000.6. The proposals have been discussed with the Chancellor and the Minister of Health, who have no objections to them.7. I ask for authority to prepare and submit to the Home Affairs Committee a Bill giving effect to the recommendations referred to in this memorandum.W. E. E.Scottish Office, Whitehall, October 20, 1937.
