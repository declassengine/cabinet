Copy.HOUSE OP COMMONS, PRIVATE 29 th July, 1937,Dear Ormsby Gore,We wish to submit to you the following considerations arising out pf the debate on the Government White Paper on Palestine.1.     An analysis of the debate in the House of Commons on Wednesday, 21st July, shows that the speakers, apart from yourself and Lqrd Winterton, belong to three separate categories: those who sympathised with Zionism and either opposed partition or supported the principle reluctantly, while pressing for considerable emendation in favour of the Jews:    those who were sympathetic tq the Arab cause and at the same time supported, partition;    and lastly certain Privy Councillors, all of them strong Zionists and all of them sensitive about the past.A number of Jews and non-Aryans in all parts of the House gave their views:    there is no Moslem in the House of Commons.      Further, no Arab sympathiser was called before 7.40 p.m and the Arab case went by default in the newspapers the next day, Those three who spoke supported partition and behind them were a number of other members ready and anxious, if called, to back you.2.     The part played by ox-Cabinet Ministeis seems to us misleading.     The failure of the policy for which Mr. Lloyd george and Mr. Churchill were chiefly responsible was the theme of the debate.   Had the Government asked for the vote of the House, they would have gone tp the League with the approval of an overwhelming majority.     We regret that the manoeuvres ofthese
3 othese two should have induced the Government to accept without notice an amendment to an amendment to an amendment.     We believe that this compromise will inevitably be taken, especially in Palestine, as a retreat before pressure.3.     The predominant opinion in the House went unrepresented in the debate.     A great majority of members neither pro-Jew nor pro-Arab desire to see the Palestine problem resolved with the least possible dishonour to England, and with the least possible hardship to either side.     They believe further that in order to achieve a peaceful settlement, as fair as may be, the British Government must act, especially in face of Zionist pressure, with speed and resolution.     They consider that Lord Dufferin&apos;s speech in the House of Lords well represents what ought to be the Government&apos;s attitude.4.     We regret that both sections of the Opposition should have taken a party attitude towards the Report.     But that should not deter the Government from proceeding on its course.     The White Paper^has the almost unanimous support of the press and the public.In Palestine the only alternative to their policy would be the adoption of a much more active police system and all the rigours of martial law.      Repeated outbreaks, vh ich there would be every reason to expect, would have to be met by the firm application of the death penalty, by the holding of hostages.for good behaviour, by the burning of villages and buildings from which and in which acts of violence had talc en place.     It would appear from the debate that the Opposition leaders would be willing to put into force such a policy, but we cannot believe that Parliament would endorse it without severe recriminations against the Government for not havingaccepted
5.      The disturbances of 1936 have moreover shown that the Arab Kings are becoming more and more concerned with Palestine.    whatever the disappointment about the size of the Jewish--state in Palestine might be, the Jewish people v/ill still look to England as one of the few countries where they are wholly free from persecution.    On the other hand, the friendship of the new kingdoms of the Hear East is of importance to our Empire and communications. Fortunately, we enjoy excellent relations vita the Arab Kings.    Even the Palestinian Arab still has a latent affection &quot;for the English, a fact which is borne out, for example, by the fears of many Arab leaders that some fanatic might attempt the life of the High Commissioner. If it appears that the Government1s approach to the-rob1em is conditioned &quot;by Zionist pressure, then the Arab world will regard themselves as bound by no scruple to refrain from resisting an unjust act dictated by timidity.6.      We consider that two specific opinions ought to be openly controverted by the Government sit the earliest possible moment.    The first is that British policy, ought,  in sympathy with Polish and German Jews, in their present troubles, to be more pro-Zionist.    Palestine has its ova specific problem &quot;which must be decided one way or the other on its merits and not out of consideration for Jews elsewhere.The second opinion is that the Arabs have all Arabia to go to, and we consider that the Government should make it plain that the Palestine fellaheen, in methods of cultivation, in habits of life and in systems of tenureare
5 5are related only to the Arabs in Syria? and are totally uhsulted to life in any part of the Arabian peninsula, v/e think it ought to be made quite clear that the Palestinian Fellaheen have lived on their lands for fourteen hundred years, and they, not.the Lffendi class, are the principal sufferers from Zionist penetration.7.      v/e recognise that the Jews have a documentary case of some strength.    V/e would, however, maintain that if partition is to be fought on the &quot;basis of promises given to the Jews it could equally, and we think with greater force, be opposed on the basis of promises given to the Arabs.    The letter of Sir Henry h eMail on in The Times does not, we consider in any way alter the Arab1s case.    It may be argued that the second italicised passage in the Report,  (&quot;in regard to those portions of territories therein in which Great . Britain is free to act without detriment to the interests of her ally France&quot;) might justify the contention that Palestine might be excluded from the area of the pledge.    But nothing can whittle away the significance of the fact that Sir Henry McMahon did not mention either the Jordan Valley, or the Dead Sea, or such towns as Deraa, Araam, or Salt, or any single place south of Damascus.    It was a most remarkable omission on the part of a great civil servant, who, even without the Balfour Declaration in mind, might have been aware that his words would one day come up for interpretation.Further, the Arabs have not forgotten that another portion of the MeMahon pledge was violated by the Sykes-Picot agreement, a document which caused the resignation of
of Sir Henry McMahon himself, and. which is not generally regarded, as a cred.it able incident in British diplomacy. The strong point we would emphasize is that the Arabs in Palestine, described by the balfour declaration as the non-Jewish population, relied on the McMahon pledge and definitely understood that they were to be liberated from the Turks.    Liberation could not but imply.3r tutelage leading to self-governing - institutions.   These were precisely the two blessings which General Allenby promised. Finally, the fact that under a Glass A mandate the British Government never fulfilled its obligation to grant self-governing institutions because the Arabs were in a majority, does lend the strongest support to their contention that they have not had fair treatment from England.8.     l/e would strongly rebut the contention of Mr.Morgan Jones, Mr.Amery and certain other sjpeal-ers   that the troubles in Palestine have been due to maladministration, and even if it be true, that the British administration has been at heart sympathetic with the Arabs, this argument is muddle-headed in that.it in no way affects the situation which the Government have to face toda3r.    In our view the unfortunate result of the debate was due to the excessive influence of ex-Ministers with pasts to explain..9.      we desire to comment on the two principal problems of partition, Defence and Minorities.On Defence one major point stands out.    Even as the proposed frontiers are drawn, the Jewish state has no natural line of defence.    The coastal strip south of Haifa could not be defended unless the Jews were granted the wholeof
fef the slopes right up to the top of the central plateau. Prom Meggido to Beisan the frontier affords no strategical advantage.    Between Tiberias and Huleh, the natural defences are very inadequate, and along the north, though the country is rougher, there will be a large antipathetic population within the boundaries of the Jewish state,    we believe that any search for a strategic frontier would be hopeless, and that therefore, partition should be based on the existing ethnic division.10.    In any settlement the Jewish state must have two guarantees.    As a member of the League of nations, it will have the guarantee of the Covenant, for what it is worth, but We think that a further specific guarantee should be given to both sides by Great Britain.    we can in no way accept as correct Mr.Amery&apos;s view that the permanent British enclave will be an undesirable liability.    we regard a legitimate reason to keep a land and air ba.se north of the Sues Canal (as well as a sea base of Haifa) as a safeguard of inestimable value for our Imperial communications, and for our Iraqi Allies,    we believe that the history of the last .,ar illustrates this point.    In addition, we consider that the proposed British Mandate for- the Holy Places is , on relgiious and other grounds, both necessary and desirable,    we have heard no protests &quot;whatever from Indian or other Moslems against this trusteeship-11.    The principal obstacle to the successful formation of the proposed states is the existence of the large Arab minority within the borders of the Jewish State,    We doubt the possibility of compulsory transference:    but we do not question the need and desirability of transference on a voluntary basis.
We regard it as most unfortunate that virtually the whole of the citrus and corn country should have been proposed to be given to the Jewish State.     It would be more satisfactory if, for example, the Arab lands south of Jaffa and that portion of the Jewish state south of the corridor was granted to the Arabs.     These Arab lands are held in trust for religious purposes (El Qaf) and are exchangeable but not alienable under Moslem law.     We regard it as both wrong and dangerous that the whole of the Arab territories north of the angle Acre, Nazareth, Safad, should be given to the Jewish State.       So far, no Jews whatsoever have gone into this area.     The Jews have been given the whole of the good land in Palestine, plus this purely Arab area.     This lends some justification to the Arab contention that the proposed basis of partition itself is an unfair one.     The demographic figures prove it.     Out of the present population in Palestine, more than 500,000 are living in the area of the proposed Jewish state.     180,000 are living in the British enclave.     225,000 Arabs are living in the proposed Jewish state.     Only 1,400 Jews are living in the Arab state.     While nobody wishes to perpetuate government by mathematics, we must point out that there is no element of consolation or compensation for the Arabs in seeing 100,000 jews transferred from the British enclave to the Jewish state in return for their populations to be transferred from the Jewish to the Arab state.12.     In conclusion, we would state that in resisting further pressure, the Government, and. you personally, may be assured of our support for partition, and we are convinced, of the support of the great majority of members who have hitherto not been vocal.     We believe with the Commissioners, that theonly
only chance of permanent peace in Palestine is to separate the territory of the Jew from that of the Arab.we are sYours sincerely-(Signed)D, Clifton Brown Archibald R.J.Southby. W.P.3pens.
