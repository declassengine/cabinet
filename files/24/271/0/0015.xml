[S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)8 0-HET.COPY NO.       ^4b. 215 (57).C A.B I N E T,THE STIFFENING OF BRITISH MERCHANT SHIPS TO ENABLE THEM TO TAKE DEFENSIVE ARMAMENT.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.The Admiralty have had under review the preparations necessary to enable them to put into operation with the minimum possible delay the defensive arming of merchant ships which has been approved as one of the first measures .to be taken for ensuring the maintenance of our seaborne trade in time of war.     Experience in the late war proved beyond dispute that defensive armament in merchant ships is of the utmost value against attack hy lightly armed surface vessels and submarines.      It is now considered equally important that merchant ships should have also some form of defence against aircraftoOver 3,000 guns of 4&quot; calibre or larger, and over 1,000 12 pdr. guns are already available for issue to merchant ships and supplies of ammunition are &quot;being built up. The provision of a suitable anti-aircraft weapon has also been approved-This equipment cannot be fitted in merchant ships unless and until the necessary stiffening to enable the decks to take the gun mountings has been incorporated.      Under existing Treasury authority, the provision of guns and gun
mountings is recognised as a Government responsibility, but the cost of stiffening the ships, other than those to be converted into armed merchant cruisers, has since 1919 been regarded as a voluntary liability of the shipowners.      This policy has not been effective in that, so far as is known, in only two vessels has stiffening been incorporated during the last 15 years,The Admiralty,  through the medium of the Shipping Defence Advisory Committee, have investigated the matter of liability of cost and this investigation has shown that with very few exceptions shipowners will not undertake this work at their own expense;    nor is this surprising since in the present circumstances it is very difficult for the shipping industry to bear any unproductive cost, however   small, in the construction of their vessels.      It is, therefore, considered that the cost of stiffening should be accepted as a Government liability and it is pointed out that in comparison, with the value of the guns, mountings and munitions, this represents a minute additional cost.. The average cost of stiffening a ship during construction, if incorporated in the original design, is estimated to amount to  800 only per ship.      If done after completion of the ship,  this cost would be greatly increased and may reach as much as  1,200 per ship.The p:t?eparation of ships to take a defensive armament must not be left until the outbreak of war.    The need for the maintenance of the flow of trade at such a time does not admit of wholesale delays by keeping ships in harbour while stiffening is being fitted.     Nor could the necessary facilities for the work, i.e. the labour and material he guaranteed at such a time in view of other
essential demands on the shipyards.      The reduction in the number of British merchant ships since 1914 increases the importance of avoiding unnecessary delays.It has been argued that the strengthening of ships for carrying defensive armament is comparable with preparations for passive defence in the United kingdom (e.g.  against air attack) and   that,  therefore,  any-decision as regards the Governments share of the cost-must await Government policy as regards passive defence.      The Admiralty do not feel that the comparison is a true one and consider that the stiffening of merchant ships is a measure not of passive but of active defence and,  therefore, constitutes a separate problem.      Moreover,  passive defence is related mainly to air attack from a country in fairly close proximity and is required only against a potential enemy in close proximity to this country who possesses a powerful air force.Our merchant ships, however, must be protected in all and every part of the seas to which requirements of our supplies take them and protection must,  therefore, be of universal application,  i, e,  against any enemy or enemies wherever their forces may be operating.The desirability of obtaining an early^decision on this matter is accentuated by the fact that at the present time there are 221 ships of over 500 tons gross now being built in Great Britain, many of which will he completed shortly. There are already indications of a probable decrease in the amount of new construction to be laid down in the near future owing to the recent rise in the price of raw materials. Consequently it may be a long time before there is another
occasion so favourable for the stiffening of ships under construction as at the present.The Admiralty, therefore, put forward the following proposals:(a) To undertake to meet the cost of stiffeningduring construction all suitable merchant vessels of 500 tons gross and over for one L-Ao gun and one A.A.  gun at an estimated annual -cost of  32,400.(b) To expend a further amount annually, for such period as is necessary,  in stiffening such vessels already built as may be selected for the purposeo      The annual expenditure under this head is provisionally estimated .   at  50,000,        This would enable 66 ships on an average to be stiffened annually, but the provision would be required only for a limited period.,For this comparatively small expenditure the powersof defence of our Merchant Navy in wartime will heenormously increased,  whereas if this small sum is savedlarge expenditure in other directions, namely, the accumu-lation of guns and mountings, may have been wasted.(Intd.)    D.C.Admiralty, S.V7.1.,22nd September,  1937.
