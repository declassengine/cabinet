CONFIDENTIAL. A.C.588.BOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL. STATE OF TRADE - AUGUST,  1957.Summary of reports submitted by members of the Board of Trade Advisory Council (supplemented in some cases with statistical information from other sources).OVERSEAS. TRADE.      Imports in August at  86.7 m,  were  20.6 m. more than in August,  1936.      Two-thirds of the rise was in food and raw materials.      Of the increase of  6.85 m. in manufactured goods, over  2-g- m.  related to non-ferrous metals and manufactures,  1.3 m.  to nils,  etc., nearly  1 m.  to iron and steel and  700,000 to machinery.      Exports of United Kingdom products,  42.5 m., were  7.3 m. more and re-exports,  6.7 m., were  2.3 m. more than in August, 1936.EMPLOYMENT.      The total number of unemployed persons jn the registers at 23rd August - 1*358,621 - was 20,838 less than at 26th July;    the changes in the various divisions were:-London ..... i. South Eastern South WesternMidland ......North Eastern.-1,379 Northwestern .....  * 8,442.4-2,006 Northern..........  + 5,089.-f2,706 Scotland..........  -23,50254 Wales..............  -fc .1,552.-15,698The estimated number of insured workers aged 16-64 in employment (excluding agricultural workers) was 11,562,000 -45,000 more than in July and 490,000 more than in August, 1936, Employment improved between July and August in coal mining and in iron and steel, pottery, wool textiles and jute manufacture.      Employment declined in the motor vehicle, tailoring and cotton industries and   in the distributive trades.
RAILWAY TRAFFIC.      In the four weeks ended 29th August, railway traffic receipts increased by  360,000 (2.64 per cent.) as compared with the corresponding period of 1936.     Passenger traffic receipts increased by 3.05 per centi, merchandise, minerals and livestock by 1,75 per centi and coal, coke, etc. by 2.87 per cent.BANKING.      Money was in ample supply throughoutAugust and the banks were willing buyers of bills fromthe market at The Treasury Bill rate fluctuated only between 10/3.08d. and 10/5.64d.      The note circulationreached a record level of  504 m. at the beginning ofAugust owing to holiday currency demands.     The goldmarket was very quiet;    the price fluctuated between139/3^-d. and 140/ld.      The price of silver declined from 1 &quot;320 /-^g to 19 /i6a. on the threat of sales from China but -later recovered somewhat.      The dollar remained weak at the beginning of August   but later strengthened to 4.96, The spot franc was steady between 132f and 133 but the three months forward rate fluctuated considerably between 2f and 4   /i6 francs discount.SHIPPING.    The volume of business in freight markets increased and rates again improved in several directions.     Demand for tonnage was world wide.      The Chamber of Shipping index number of freights (1913 ^ 100) was 163.20 as compared with 146.41 in July and 93.85 in August, 1936.SHIPBUILDING.     Activity was well maintained in Augustj though new orders for merchant tonnage were scarce. Warship construction provided considerable employment.COAL.      The position on the whole remained satisfactory. In the inland trade, demand for domestic coals experienced the usual summer reduction;    industrial demand continued
to expand.     Prices were hardening.    Output for the four weeks ended 7th August  (15.67 m. tons) was 608,000 tons more than in the corresponding period a year before. Exports in August amounted to 3.53 rru tons as compared with 2.75 m. tons a year before.     Most markets took more, the main increases being to Italy, Prance and the Scandinavian countries     Prospects for the immediate future are favourable and an appreciably higher world price level seems probable.IRON AND STEEL.     Markets were quieter owing to the holidays, but latterly increased activity has been apparent. Pig-iron output (712,600 tons), though less than in July, was 12$ more than a year before.     Pour more furnaces were in blast at the end of August.     Crude steel production (987,700 tons) was less than in July but 13.2% more than in August,. 1936.      The scrap position improved considerably with the arrival of satisfactory supplies from abroad.     Semis continued in strong demand and larger continental tonnages were received.      The output of finished steel, though at a record level, was readily absorbed.     Exports of iron and steel (201,400 tons) were 22.8% more than in August, 1936. Imports (particularly of pig-iron) were also greater.In Scotland steel production continued at a high level and all departments of the heavy steel trades were producing to capacity.     On the North East Coast market conditions were somewhat quieter.     Pig-iron producers were supplying enough to keep home consumers in full operation and the amounts available for export were larger.     Following the holidays, all steel works were fully occupied.     In South Wales, iron and steel production was maintained at a high level.      Tinplats business was somewhat quieter.
ENGINBBRING. There was a slight recession in activity mainly due to the holidays hut productive capacity was almost everywhere fully occupied.    Exports of machinery amounted to  3.8 m.  as compared with  3.1 m.  in August, 1936.    Imports ( 2 m.) were  700,000 more, largely hecao.se of increased imports of machine tools.MOTOR I INDUSTRY.      The number of motor vehicles newly registered in July was 37,770 - 3,411 more than a year before;    the increase in private cars was 2,965.    The production of private cars in June was 35,657 (19.0 per cent, more than a year before) and of commercial vehicles 10,319 (11.4 per cent. more).    Exports of private cars and chassis in August amounted to 6,200 and of new commercial vehicles and chassis to 1,699 - 72 per cent, and 12 per cent,  respectively more than in August, 1936.    834 complete new private cars were imported as compared with 178 a year ago.ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.    The general position remained satisfactory.    The index for heavy engineering orders (both home and export) was slightly less than for July but considerably higher than for August, 1936.      Exports of electrical apparatus and machinery ( 1.38 m. ) were 27.2$; greater than a year before.    Electricity generated was 14.8$ more.NON-FERROUS METALS. Metal markets were very firm at the beginning of August.    Consumers did not follow the advance and the outbreak of hostilities in the Far East led to speculative sellings    Prices later declined.    Home demand in general was quiet.
CHEMICALS.    Rome sales of alkalis were slightly less, and exports appreciably less,  than in July. Deliveries of chlorine products remained satisfactory. Sales of nitrogen products continued to increase compared with a year ago.    Home sales of dyestuffs were greater than in August, 1936;    exports improved.    Recent sales of fertilizers showed increases compared with a year ago;    exports for the current season have decreased slightly compared with last season, mainly owing to no sales having yet been made to China.    The benzole market was active.COTTON. Activity was seasonally slack.    New orders remained at a low level but demand improved somewhat at the end of August.    The daily yarn output index (1935 = 100) was 108 as compared with 111 in July and 101 a year before.    The spinning section operated at 83$ of capacity compared with 86% in July and 74% a year before.    In weaving and finishing production also declined.    Raw cotton prices continued to fall and yarn prices generally declined.    Yarn exports at 13.6 m.lbs. were rather more than in July and 1.9m. lbs. more than in August, 1936.   Exports of piece goods at 162 m. sq..yds. were 15 m. sq,. yds. less than in July but 3 m. sq,.yds. more than in August, 1936.    Compared with July, the chief decreases were to Australia, South Africa and Argentina;    exports to Canada, British West Africa and Cuba increased.TOOL. There was little change in general activity during August.    Raw wool prices hardened slightly. Exports of tops and yarns were less, but of tissues, greater, than a year before.    Reports indicated that there is a fair seasonal demand.
SILK AND ARTIFICIAL SILK.  Rayon. Demand fell off slightly owing to the holidays &quot;but the decline was less marked than in previous years.    Business in crepe yarns was only moderate but an improvement is anticipated.    Demand for staple fibre slackened somewhat hut less than in previous years.    The dress goods trade was quiet hut there was generally a feeling of optimism.    Exports of yarns and all-rayon fabrics showed very large increases over August, 1936, but exports of rayon mixtures declined.Silk. The seasonal slackness in the silk trade was exceptionally marked.HIDES AKD LEATHER. The general tendency of hide prices was downwards.    Conditions in the different sections of the leather industry varied, but on the whole there was a (partly seasonal) decline in business-BUILDINGr. Returns received by the Ministry of Labour from 141 Local Authorities snowed that the estimated cost of buildings for which plans were approved was  5.7 m.  - 23.7$ less than the figure for August 1936.    There were decreases of 38.3$ for factories, 29.4JS for dwelling houses and 1.1% for all other buildings and alterations to existing buildings.POTTERY.    Demand for general earthenware in July was about normal.    In chinaware home demand was flat but the increase in imports continued!    The tiles section continued very active and large extensions to factories were coming into operation;RETAIL TRADE. The money value of retail sales in July was 8.1% higher than in July, 1936.    Sales of food and perishables rose by 10.2% and of other merchandise by 6.1$.    Preliminary returns for August indicate a small increase over August, 1936,
CANADIAN TRADE. Economic  conditions improved during July and the index of physical volume of business rose further.    Compared with June, exports of copper, zinc and asbestos (after seasonal adjustment) increased; exports of nickel and planks and boards declined. Newsprint production reached a new high point.    The iron and steel industry continued active *    The seasonal decline in motor production was less than normal. Except in Saskatchewan,  prospects for farm crops were good.AUSTRALIAN TK-APh. The wool selling, season opened in Sydney on 30th August and a firm market was established.    In July 110,000 bales of wool were received into store as compared with 80,000 bales a year before, and 4,000 bales were sold or shipped compared - with 1,750 bales.    Wheat and flour shipments during December-August were equivalent to 83.1 m. bushels of wheat as compared with 76.3 m. a year before. Butter shipments from 1st July to 28th August were 3,874 tons as compared with 5,724 tons a year before. Imports of merchandise during July were valued at  11.03 m.  (Australian currency) as compared with  10.49 m.  in July,  1936.SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE. Almost every sphere of activity continued to expand during the first half of 1937.    Prospects for the rest of the year appear good but labour shortage may retard progress.Imports in June were 23.9 per cent, greater than in June-, 1936.    Exports (excluding gold) were 58.3
per cent, more, due mainly to increased exports of diamonds, maize and fruit. Gold exports were 31,7 per cent,  more and output increased appreciably.INDIAN TRADE. Imports of merchandise in August (13,29 lakhs) were 83 lakhs less than in July; total exports (15,26 lakhs) were 210 lakhs less.    In most parts of India crops were reported to he in fair to good condition.    The area under groundnuts is estimated to he grreater, and the area under sugar cane less, than last season.SOUTH AMERICA.  Competition from Germany and Italy in South America has increased   German coal exports to Argentina in the first seven months of this year (201,000 metric tons) were more than double those a year ago;    United Kingdom exports rose by 20% to 1,137,000 tons.      German exports of motor cars to Argentina exceeded United Kingdom exports last year and have further increased this year.Argentina. The Argentine Government&apos;s decision to repatriate  13 m. of gold deposited with the Bank of England testifies to the country&apos;s improved economic position.    Exports, though slowing down rapidly, were still well above last year&apos;s figure in volume and very much greater in value.    Imports in July were the highest for seven years and further expansion seems likely.Brazil. Revenue and expenditure statistics for the 1938 Buaget show a sharp increase over both 1937 and 1936,    Paper money in circulation has increased further this year.Chile. Exchange conditions were better than at any time during the present year.    Substantial amounts of frozen credits were liquidated.    Mining activity was maintained.
Paraguay. The quality of this season&apos;s cotton crop is superior to last season&apos;s, but prices have declined.Peru.  Cotton prices declined sharply.    The sugar market was quiet.    After some fluctuations the sol appreciated slightly in terms of sterling.Colombia. Gold production is steadily increasing. The foreign exchange market continued steady.Venezuela. Crude oil production for January-June, 1957, was Q% greater in volume than a year before.
