(THIS DOCUIviuWT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; b GOVERNMENT). SECRET. COIY NO.        &apos;C.F.2I;-9( 97 ) .CABINETLONDON TRAMvIC PROBLJIKS AND RliLATJEONS. WITH THE &quot;     .LONDQN&apos;ljp*^[TY &quot;COUNCIL.        &apos;MEMORANDUM BY THE : MINISTER OF: transport the major problem confronting the Ministry of transport is the Greater&apos; London Area with its accompanying traffic facilities and traffic congestion.2.      If progress is to be made with the solution of this problem, cordial co-operation between the London County Council and the Ministry of Transport is essential.      Unfortunately, relations between the two bodies have recently not been as good as they might be, and this is largely, if not wholly, due to the unfortunate dispute over Waterloo Bridge.j?.      In order that my colleagues may have all the facts before them, a brief history of that dispute is given in the Appendix to this note.      As will he seen, Parliament in June 19J)S finally agreed to the London County Council obtaining the necessary borrowing powers.      This in effect was a recognition of the fact that rightly or wrongly the old Waterloo Bridge had. been demolished and a new bridge had to be put in its place.if.      One of my first acts on taking office was to arrange a personal talk with Mr. Herbert Morrison, in order to survey the ground and to ascertain his attitude towards certain projects for the improvement of London&apos;s traffic.      I found. Mr. Morrison quite ready to meet me half-way and personally anxious to be as helpful as his other commitments would permit.     His own programme of improvements largely centres round slum clearance, housing and hospitals.5.      The schemes for London highway improvement which in my view rank first in priority are the Last-West Connection, the South Circular Road (with adequate access to a new Wandsworth Bridge) and the improvement of the northern approach to Wandsworth Bridge.      The first two, I think, are the most important as the East-West
Connection linking the Western and Eastern Avenue would do much to relieve the traffic along the Oxford Street route and mitigate congestion in the City and Inner London generally.      It would also provide a basis for a valuable and much needed improvement, in the King&apos;s Cross area.      The value of the South Circular Road, running from a new V/andsworth Bridge to Woolwich Ferry in relieving traffic south (and also to some extent, north) of the river is obvious.      These and other recommendations will appear in Sir Charles Bressey&apos;s Highway Development Survey which will be ready at the end of the year.G.     Mr. Morrison was disposed to agree that the East-&apos;?est Connection was the most urgent piece of work.      He also agreed as to the urgency of the South Circular Road and pointed out that the London County Council were already taking steps in regard to the Southern approaches to the new Wandsworth Bridge.7.     At the same ti.,e Mr. Morrison made it clear that the stumbling block in the path of whole-hearted co-operation in these and other schemes was the position as regards Waterloo Bridge.      He admitted that the Council had acted in defiance of the wishes of the Government in pulling down the old Waterloo Bridge, but he claimed that the results of the last two elections showed that the majority of Londoners desired Waterloo Bridge reconstructed on the lines the London County Council proposed.     Parliament had at last recognised that the Council must have the necessary borrowing powers for the new bridge and he urged that the Government should recognise the practical facts of the situation and not continue to withhold from London the grant towards the new bridge to which in all equity London was entitled.8.      I think there is a great deal of force in what Mr, Morrison says.      It is true that my predecessor informed
the House of Commons in 1935,  and again in 1936?  that there would he no Government grant towards Waterloo Bridge, hut I do not see- any advantage in continuing a useless vendetta.-In all matters connected with traffic problems in Greater i.-ondons nothing but good can flow from smooth relations with the London County Council and nothing but friction from .strained relations.9o    I would therefore propose to do a deal with Llr. Morrison on the following lines.      In return for an undertaking from him that he and his colleagues on the London County Council will co-operate to the full in the schemes of highway improvement for London and in particular those which are referred to in paragraph 5 of this note., viz.  the Last-West Connection and. the South Circular iioad3 I would suggest that I be authorised to offer ..;r. Morrison a 60 per cent grant towards the cost of the new Waterloo Bridge (the contract price is reported in the press to be  6709000).      This would mean a grant of something in the neighbourhood of  400s000.      I would further make it clear to him that I am not prepared to make any contribution at all towards the cost of demolishing the old bridge (which may be put at about  350 -  3009000) as this work has been carried out in defiance of the wishes of the Government.      The Government look at the matter as falling into two parts -(a) the demolition of the old bridge5  towards which no Government grant will be forthcoming for the reason indicated and (b) the building of the new bridge towards which the Government will be ready to contribute if Mr. Morrison will be generally helpful in the Governments plans for highway improvement in the Metropolis,      It will
be appreciated that the approaches to Vaterloo Bridge wall in any event rank for grant and are vital to London traffic*10o    I am hopeful that Mr. Morrison will accept this offerc      If he dcess  I think that the benefits to be secured fully justify the amount involved.11c    In considering any question relating to cross-river bridges9  the long-discussed scheme for a traffic bridge at Charing Cross naturally comes to mind and my colleagues will no doubt wish to know the present position of that scheme when considering the proposal which I am now putting forward in connection with Waterloo Bridge.      At the same time I would ask that the latter proposal be considered as an entirely separate issue and on its own merits.12.    The present position of the Charing Cross Bridge proposal is that the London Traffic Advisory Committee are considering the Joint Report of a number of Committees of the London County Council which was referred to them on 2nd June last.      This Joint Report contains certain criticisms of the Report of the Advisory Committee as to the necessity for safeguarding a route for a new bridge at Charing Cross.I have gathered that Mr. Morrison and other members of the London County Council are not in favour of a new bridge at Charing Cross,      Quite apart from the fact that the promotion of a Bills  even if the London County Council were prepared to promote one5 which is somewhat doubtful,, would give rise to much controversy^  the question arises whether the money would not be better spent on other schemes in London.So far,,  I am not convinced of the practicability of a. scheme being prepared to which objections could not be raised on some good ground or another.      There is also thehavediscussed
October Ik, -I9y.possibility that the Survey of Highway Development in Greater London, which is now being completed by Sir Charles Bressey and Is expected to be ready about the end of the year, may have an important bearing on the question.It may well be that it may prove necessary to abandon the idea of a new bridge at Charing Cross, since it has been represented to me that in the best interests of London It would be well to ascertain the effect of other measures for the Improvement of conditions in Central London which are less costly and probably more urgent than a new Charing Cress bridge.13.     When Sir Charles Bressey&apos;s Survey is available and we have the further report of the Advisory Committee, we shall be in a better position to reach some final decision about the Charing Cross Bridge.      Meanwhile it would obviously be premature to make any announcement, although I am very conscious of the desirability of doing so at the earliest possible moment.      It Is useless sterilising property development and bringing a state of nervousness into the market if there is no reasonable possibility of a bridge being erected on that line in the near future.1k.      The Waterloo Bridge proposal is, however, on an entirely different footing and I would ask for a decision now on that matter and for authority to approach the London County Council, in return for a full programme of collaboration, with an offer ef  ^00,000 or thereabouts for Waterloo Bridge.(initialled)    L.B.
A-ILILE N D I X.WATERLOO BRIDGE.tL.C.C,  decided to rebuild, rather than to underpin, tc take 6 lines of traffic.      Government decided not to intervene.Government accepted recommendation of Royal Commission on Cross River Traffic to preserve Bridge. The matter deferred pending a decision as to need for road bridge at Charing Cross.Governments offer of 75 per cent,  for bridge ati -Cnarmg Cross withdrawn.      London County Council re-affirmedneed for new Waterloo Bridge of 6 lines of traffic.Grant of 60 per cent,  offered for new 6 linebridge.House of Commons rejected proposal of London County Council to borrow money for constructing new bridge. London County Council informed that a grant could, not be made towards a scheme which House of Commons had disapproved.      The Minister suggested to London County Council that estimates for reconstruction should be obtained and offered 60 per cent.-London County Council decided to proceed with new bridge of 6 lines.-London County Council were informed that Government could not make a grant to any scheme running contrary to the expressed opinion of Parliament and that they would not be prepared to take any steps with a view to urging Parliament to alter a decision so recently arrived at.In the course of a debate on the Council&apos;s Money Bill, Cession 1933/34, on the 30th hay, 1934, the then Minister stated that if the House altered the decision to place a ban upon borrowing by the London
County Council for the purpose of a new bridge, he would regard himself as being in a position to offer a grant fromthe Road Fund,      The House of Commons instructed the Committeeto whom the Bill was referred, to amend the Bill by omittingthe provision relating to Waterloo Bridge,The Counby Council again endeavoured to obtainborrowing powers in the Session 1934/35.     Acting uponinstructions of the Cabinet yir. Ho re-Bel isha stated on the5rd June, 1935, that -&quot;whatever decision therefore the House may wish to reach on the question of the financial method of meeting the cost which has been incurred and particularly on the proposal to allow the County Council now to bo:., row, the Government have no desire to stand in the Council&apos;s way - there can no longer be any question of a grant from national funds in aid of the expenditure which the Council have decided to incur on their own motion and contrary to the wishes of Parliament&quot;.The House of Commons decided not to approve theCouncil&apos;s proposal to incur capital expenditure for thepurpose.In their iaoney Bill of the Session 1935/36,  the Council once again applied for powers to borrow for the new bridge.      During the course of the Debate on the 18th June, 1936, Mr. Hore-Belisha said:      &quot;the attitude of the Government in this matter is precisely what it &quot;was last year&quot;, and thus made it clear that whatever the decision of the House on the Bill no grant from the Road Fund would be forthcoming.The House of Commons agreed to the Council obtaining the necessary borrowing powers, and the County Council in July, 1936, renewed their application for a grant. In submitting this application they stated that they had reached the decision to construct a new bridge in view of the authoritative advice on the question of danger to river navigation and the inability of the old bridge,  even if it
yhad been widened to the limit of its capacity, to satisfy present and future traffic needs.The Council were informed that the Minister was precluded from acceding to  their request for a grant for the reason stated in the House of Commons by him when the County Council endeavoured to obtain borrowing powers in the Session 1954/35. january, 1937. Mr. more-Belisha received a deputation from theLondon County Council on the 18th January, 1937, when he promised that he would refer the Council&apos;s representations to the Government.     --Subsequently the Council were informed that the Government had no alternative but to refuse to make a grant of public money from national funds to such a purpose.
