(THIS   DOCUMENT    IS   THE   PROPERTY    Off HIS   BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S    GOVERNMENT) .SECRET.CP.  238(37) COPY NO.   A3CAB  I N E T.IRON ORE WORKINGS. Memorandum by the Minister of Health.I desire to obtain Cabinet approval to the appointment of a Committee to inquire and report on certain problems arising from the working of iron ore.My attention has^ been drawn by the Northamptonshire County Council to the particular difficulties which have arisen from the recent large scale developments in that county, and my officers have been in informal consultation with other interested Departments.     In their recently published report on their investigation into the present circumstances of the iron and steel industry the Import Duties Advisory Committee have expressed their concern at the desolation produced by the excavations round Corby, the main centre of the recent developments in the county.I have been in communication with the President of the Board of Trade and the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and we are agreed that the. problem merits investigation but that the issues likely to be raised are of such importance that the matter should be considered by the Cabinet in the first place.The main facts of the present situation are: (l) The usual method of reaching the ironstone is to remove the overburden by large mechanical grabs, if necessary, to a depth of 70 to 100 feet.   &apos; The removal of
the overburden results in the excavated area being left covered with subsoil clays piled in roughly parallel ridges 3 to 15 feet high.     This land is quite unfit for agriculture and looks very desolate.(2) The scale of operations may be judged from the fact that the area of the County is about 900 square miles and the principal ironstone field now being developed in the county consists of about 200 square miles.(3) At least 11 companies operate in the area, the largest operators being Messrs. Stewart &amp; Lloyds who have been responsible for the extensive recent developments at Corby and who control about 36,000 acres.(4) At present there are about 1,600 acres of wasteexcavated land around Corby caused by the operations of Messrs.  Stewart &amp; Lloyds, and this is being added to at therate of 200 acres per annum.     The operations of the other companies may be expected to double this amount, so thaton the present basis of procedure there will be 25 square miles of waste land round Corby at the end of the next20 years,(5) The arrangements in operation do not make any effective provision for restoration of the land.     A common feature of the arrangement is that the mining company have the option either of restoring the land or of paying the owner at the rate of  30 per acre of land handed back unrestored.     It is only possible to restore the land at this cost when the overburden is shallow, and the result is therefore that the land is in nearly all cases handed back unrestored.(6) Arrangements between landowners, and mineral workers vary according to circumstances but it is understood that the total received by the owners of the land in payment for leases, royalties and indemnity amounts to  230 -
 560 per acre plus return of the land at the end in a more or less useless condition0      The value of the land as agricultural land before being worked is understood to be from  15 to  20 per aorec      It has been estimated that the cost of restoration for agricultural purposes might be something between  240 and  320 an acre where the overburden is deepaThe present position is therefore that large areas of agricultural land are year by year being converted into waste land; with no provision for their restoration,.     The only possible use to which the land could be put in its present state appears to be afforestation,     A certain amount of afforestation has been done but it is difficult to draw any conclusions from it as the trees have almost everywhere suffered from inadequate care and attention,. The cost of complete restoration for agricultural purposes would vary according to the depth of the overburden and might often exceed the sums accruing to the landowner even where he is the owner of the mineral rights as well as the surface rights0      Wherej  as sometimes is the case,    he Is the owner of the surface rights only the cost of restoration might greatly exceed any benefit he has obtained or can in future obtain from the landaAs soon as the developments at Gorby were announced the local authorities took action to see that the growth of the district was properly planned and controlled^ but their powers, whether under planning legislation or otherwise, are quite inadequate to deal with the problems which have now arisen,.The working of the iron ore deposits is undoubtedly in the national interest but it seems to be impossible on national grounds to contemplate that this large area of land should be left permanently ruined and derelict0      It has
recently become clear that one of the reasons why the older industrialised areas are unattractive to new industries is because of the desolation of- thedr- appeals-rance.In the long run it cannot be to the national advantage to destroy agricultural land at the speed at which this is being done in Northamptonshire without doing anything to provide an alternative productive asset.     To provide such an asset would no doubt involve considerable expenditure, and the question would arise how it is equitable-able and practicable that such expenditure should be defrayed. -If any action were taken which involved the imposition of expenditure for the purpose of restoring land (whether it were imposed on landowners, on mining companies or on public bodies) the decisions arrived at on the iron ore industry would no doubt apply in different degrees to other industries elsewhere.      I appreciate that the problem is likely to raise controversial Issues of considerable importance, but I do not think that we ought on this account to stand aside and watch the creation of another desolated area.The subject is one which would require a careful investigation before any action could be t.aken0      It seems to me that it could most suitably be investigated by a Committee appointed for this purpose, a Committee of strictly limited numbers consisting of persons independent of tho particular interests concerned^      The views of interested persons could in my opinion be most suitably obtained by evidenceoAlthough the Northamptonshire area is the chief focus of interest at the moment there are similar fields in Lincolnshire, Leicestershire and Oxfordshire, and I do not suggest that the scope of the inquiry need be limited to Northamptonshire,
I suggest that the Committee might . b-e-given the following terms of reference:-&quot;To consider the problems raised by the destruction of agricultural land as a result of the excavation of iron ore in Northamptonshire and neighbouring counties and to advise what measures should he taken for the fixture utilisation of this land to the best advantage whether by restoration or otherwise and how the necessary expenditure should be met&quot;0The Treasury have been consulted and agree with the proposals now submitted.K.W.October 15th,  1957,
