THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1937.SECRET. Copy No. 4 9CP. 247 (37).CABINET.COMMITTEE ON ARABIC BROADCASTING.REPORT.AT their meeting on the 21st July, 1937 (Cabinet 31 (37), Conclusion 6 (6)), the Cabinet appointed a Committee composed as follows : The Minister of Health (in the Chair), The Lord Privy Seal,A representative (Cabinet Minister or TJnder-Secretary) of the Treasury, Foreign Office, Dominions Office, India Office, Colonial Office and the Post Office,with the following terms of reference : To enquire into the details of the proposed medium-wave station at Cyprus in order to satisfy the Cabinet that the station would prove adequate for its intended purpose from the point of view of technical efficiency and the programmes to be broadcast, and other matters related thereto, such as Departmental responsibility and local organisation.2. During the course of our enquiries two matters have come to light which have an important bearing on the problem. In the first place, it has become clear that a broadcasting service to cover the Arabic-speaking world cannot be satis-factorily achieved by medium-wave transmission alone, wherever the station is located; and, secondly, the Foreign Office have proposed that the British Broadcasting Corporation should inaugurate a news service in Spanish and Portuguese to the countries in South America.3. When the question of broadcasts in Arabic was before the Cabinet in July last, the position then was that there existed at Jerusalem a medium-wave station under the administration of the Palestine Government, which was to be used for the transmission in Arabic of news bulletins and other information prepared by the Foreign Office, and designed to counteract Italian propaganda. This procedure was started in September and is now in force. The objection to using Jerusalem as a permanent station for this purpose was that it was, and would probably remain, in mandated territory, which would impose restrictions possibly to an increasing extent on the kind of message which the Foreign Office might, from time to time, require to broadcast. It was necessary, therefore, to look for an alternative site which would be under unrestricted British control and would, at the same time, provide for clear reception by Arabic-speaking peoples on a medium-wave transmission. Transmission by short-wave seemed to be ruled out, as it was understood that the persons for whom the broadcasts were intended were, for the most part, using medium-wave sets which could not receive short-wave transmissions. This would make it unnecessary to consider the possibility of sending out Arabic broadcasts from a locality, e.g., from this country, which was not in or adjacent to the Near East, and from which, therefore, an effective service on a medium wave could not be provided. Actually, Cyprus was recommended by the Foreign Office as the place which most nearly complied with all the requirements as then conceived.[16007]     , b
4. It has now been realised that satisfactory reception from a medium-wave transmitting set of the power that could be installed in Cyprus, or that exists at present at Jerusalem, cannot be secured beyond a range of some 300 miles. It follows, therefore, that, if such a transmitter were located at Cyprus, broadcasts could not be received in Iraq, the Persian Gulf, most of Arabia&apos;, Southern Egypt and the Sudan. A similar, though slightly less extensive, area would be ruled out if the broadcasts were sent out from Jerusalem. If, therefore, the whole of the Near and Middle East is to be covered, transmission by short-wave is essential. Although the Italian propaganda is sent out in the first place from the medium-wave station at Bari, it is also sent out by a short-wave station at Rome, and it is messages from that station which are picked up in the Near and Middle East. Further enquiries, moreover, have shown that a far larger number of listeners in the Near and Middle East than had been thought possess sets able to receive on both short and iriedium wave, and that the tendency will be more and more in the direction of short-wrave reception. So far, therefore, as the potential listeners are concerned, there is no objection to the use of short-wave transmission. In consequence, it would be quite practicable to cover the Arabic-speaking zone by broadcasts on a short wave from this country, since there are no technical difficulties in the adoption of such a course.5. On the other hand, if a short-wave transmitter is erected in the Near East, it will not by itself reach all the Arabic-speaking peoples because it is a feature of such sets that messages sent out by them cannot be received within a range of a few hundred miles of the set. Accordingly, if the broadcasting station is to be set up in the Near East, either at Cyprus or at Jerusalem, both a short-wave and a medium-wave transmitter will be required to cover adequately the whole of the Arabic-speaking world.6. The alternatives, therefore, appear to lie between the erection of a short-wave and a medium-wave transmitter at Cyprus with its variant of putting the short-wave set at the existing station at Jerusalem in the first instance as a temporary measure prior to its transference to Cyprus and the emission of messages on a short wave from this country. There is a third alternative, namely, to erect a short-wave set in India. We have considered this latter possibility, but it has a number of serious objections. In the first place, on the broadcasting aspect alone, such a station would cut right across the plans of the Government of India for the development of a broadcasting service in that country, on which the staff concerned is at present fully engaged. Secondly, the Government of India is clearly reluctant to undertake the scheme even if the whole cost of the station were borne by the Home Government, and in the absence of willing co-operation it is impossible to expect that the scheme would be carried out efficiently. Thirdly, the political uncertainties of the future in India make it an undesirable place at which to establish a station to be used for propaganda, with some of which, for example, Moslems might find themselves in disagreement. Fourthly, there is reason to suppose that certain of the Arabic-speaking peoples would not appreciate at its proper value a broadcast distributed from India. They would disparage such broadcasts and discount their contents. These do not exhaust the objections the cost of the station in India, for example, would be appreciably higher than in either of the other two alternatives but they are sufficient in our opinion to rule out India as a practicable possibility for a station to be used for broadcasting in Arabic.7. As regards Cyprus, we think that a station in that small island could only be operated under conditions of great difficulty. In favour of the locality is the fact that it is undisputed British territory, although actual control by the Foreign Office would be somewhat remote and would have to be exercised indirectly through the Colonial Office and the Governor of Cyprus. Secondly, advantage could be taken of a medium-wave set at Cyprus to send out broadcasts in Greek and Turkish suitable for the Cypriots speaking those languages, which would also be received in Greece and Turkey. On the other hand, the distance of Cyprus from this country would make certain aspects of control a matter of considerable difficulty. The station is definitely intended to be used from time to time for propaganda, and an important factor in regard to such messages is not only their contents, but their method of delivery. Even though the messages were prepared and translated by the Foreign Office, and sent out in a form ready for
delivery, it would be extremely hard to ensure that they were in fact delivered through the&apos;microphone in a proper manner. Again, it is recognised that, if the Arabic-speaking peoples are expected to listen regularly to news bulletins, they must be induced to do so by the emission of an adequate supporting entertainment programme. It would be worse than useless to broadcast a programme inferior to that offered by our broadcasting rivals. The provision of such a programme at Cyprus would be a matter of great difficulty and relatively considerable expense even to a body which has long experience in the administration of a broadcasting service. The difficulty would be greatly increased for a Government Department which has no such experience.The capital outlay required would be much greater than that needed for the same purpose in Great Britain, and the annual cost of providing a first-class programme would be considerably higher than the cost of providing such a programme in this country. Indeed, it is doubtful whether the requisite standard could be attained. It would be quite impracticable to make use of the station for broadcasts in languages spoken in other parts of the world, such as Spanish and Portuguese. Sending out messages in Arabic, Greek and Turkish from a powerful station in Cyprus would be a marked breach of International Broad-casting regulations. Further, listeners would not be impressed by the claims of Cyprus to be regarded as an authoritative centre for the distribution of world news, unless the station were admitted from the outset to be what in fact it would be, namely, a propagandist centre for the British Government. Indeed, it would be impossible to obtain Parliamentary authority for the proposed Service without revealing the extent of control tb be exercised by the Home Government. The method of presenting the Parliamentary Estimate, and the allocation of Ministerial responsibility, would also give rise to serious difficulties; while it would even be for consideration whether this Government would be entitled to commit themselves to continuous expense upon so novel a Service without the authority of a specific statute.With these considerations in mind we could not recommend the construction of a station at Cyprus for broadcasting in Arabic unless it proved impossible to find any other solution.8. We now turn to the alternative of a short-wave station in this country. Our first comment is that, if this course were adopted, it is inconceivable that such a station should be controlled and operated by a Government Department direct, and that the only practicable arrangement would be for the service to be provided by the British Broadcasting Corporation. This raises at once the question of the propriety and advisability of broadcasts by the B.B.C. in a foreign language, and, if the principle of such broadcasts be accepted, whether the completely independent position of the B.B.C. is compatible with an adequate regard for the views of the Foreign Office in matters concerning such broadcasts.9. It will be convenient at this stage to refer to the proposal of the Foreign Office that news bulletins in Spanish and Portuguese should be broadcast by the B.B.C. to South America. The scheme is set out in a Foreign Office memorandum dated the 13th September, 1937 (A.B.C. (37) 4), attached as an Appendix to this Report. Attention is drawn to the increasing number and length of broadcasts to South America in Spanish and Portuguese by countries outside that Continent, designed to create in the South American public a predisposition towards the countries from which the broadcasts emanate, in the hope that the attitude of mind thus formed may secure, or later be turned to, political and commercial advantage. It is argued that Great Britain cannot allow her position in relation to the South American countries to go by default, and accordingly it is proposed that we should embark on similar and competitive action as soon as possible. It has been ascertained that 15-minute news bulletins in Spanish and Portuguese could be sent out by the B.B.C. between the fifth and sixth transmissions of the Empire Service without impairing the efficiency of that Service as at present organised, and the Foreign Office recommend that this course should be adopted, to be followed, if necessary and if suitable arrangements can be made, by a more extensive programme.10.   It is necessary to emphasise that the Foreign Office regard the Arabic broadcasts on the one hand, and the Spanish and Portuguese on the other, as on a different footing.  In the latter case they contemplate that the news items would [160071 * b 2
be collected, selected, edited and presented solely by the. B.B.C. They would not be in any way controversial and they would be unlikely to involve the B.B.C. in any difficulties, being for the most part merely translations of the news bulletins broadcast in English from the Empire Station. As regards the Arabic broadcasts, however, it is the intention of the Foreign Office that these should be of a pro-pagandist nature. They would consist, for the most part, of restrained corrective statements and of the more subtle forms of counter-propaganda, and would not contain anything blatant or offensive. At the same time the Foreign Office consider it inevitable, in view of unfriendly Italian wireless attacks, that the Arabic broadcasts might, from time to time, have a controversial aspect, and for this reason, when it was clear that short-wave transmission was necessary to reach Arabic-speaking people, and that hroadcasting from this country thus became a practical possibility, that Department was at first averse from entrusting Arabic broadcasts to the B.B.C.11. We felt that the question of broadcasts in foreign languages from this country could not be carried further without a knowledge of the views of the B.B.C., and at our meeting on the 4th October we had the advantage of the presence of Mr. Norman, Sir John Reith, Sir Noel Ashbridge (Chief Engineer) and Mr. Graves (Director of Programmes). Some of the arguments for and against broadcasts from this country in foreign languages are set out in the Foreign Office memorandum reproduced in the Appendix. They were independently endorsed by the representatives of the B.B.C. Briefly, it may be said that on the one hand is the fact that to an increasing extent listeners in many different parts of the world are receiving in their own tongues broadcasts, part of which, at best, are designed to develop an outlook, political, commercial and social, in favour of the broad-casting country and at the worst are deliberately intended to disparage the reputation-tion, actions and achievements of other countries. Much of the propaganda is doubtless so crude as to defeat its object, but by reason of constant repetition, and, so far as Great Britain is concerned, the absence of any corrective statements, it is far from certain that listeners will not retain a wrong impression. If Great Britain wishes its views and its general outlook to reach people of other countries it cannot afford to neglect a medium which is being used to so great an extent by other nations. If this medium is to be used with effect, then wireless messages must go out in languages which can be understood by listeners.On the other hand the present high reputation and prestige of wireless services from this country are universally recognised, and can be attributed in part to the fact that all such services are conducted in English. They are also due to the policy hitherto adopted in regard to British broadcasting, which, aiming at presenting the truth without distortion, differs fundamentally from that of other countries. An entry into competition with the methods of other countries of lower standing, it is argued, will only soil our hands, and transfer to us part of the discredit attaching at present to other countries. Indeed, the effect might, it is feared, be to raise the credit of the broadcasts of certain other countries which at present receive little credence. Moreover, as soon as the propagandist nature of the Arabic broadcasts is appreciated, the reputation of all British broadcasts will be damaged, and, in particular, an early suspicion, now entirely dispelled, of the Empire Broadcasting Service as a vehicle for Imperial propaganda will be revived.12. Mr. Norman told us that, although the Board had considered the question of broadcasts in a foreign language, they had not reached any definite conclusions, partly because, although they were aware from Departmental discussions that the Foreign Office was moving in the matter, they were not aware exactly what was in the Government y mind. During the discussion it became clear that amongst the Board and the senior officials of the Corporation there is some difference of opinion, but the majority, which includes the Chairman and the Director-General, are now in favour of foreign language broadcasts. There was, however, complete unanimity on the part of the B.B.C. representatives on the following five aspects of the problem : In the first place they submitted that the body to be charged with the duty of undertaking a broadcasting service in foreign languages if the policy is once decided on should be the B.B.C. No other body should, in their opinion, carry out the task in this country. Secondly, if a Foreign Service was started it must he maintained at a high standard with a strong sustaining programme.  Thirdly,
the institution of a Foreign Service must not in any way prejudice the Empire Service either in its present relatively undeveloped state or in its future expansion, which was essential. Fourthly, if the B.B.C. provided a Foreign Service they must remain as independent in respect of it as they now were in regard to the Home Service, and, fifthly, the cost of a Foreign Service could not be met out of the sum available to the B.B.C. for the provision of a Home Service. Special arrangements in regard to finance would be required.In the course of further discussion it was stated that ultimately, for an adequate Foreign Service, two additional transmitters would be required involving a capital outlay of the order of  100,000. The cost of maintenance, inclusive of engineering and programme costs, fees, salaries and copyright, would amount to about  100,000 per annum. These figures represented the ultimate outlay, and the time taken to reach them would depend on the rate at which a Foreign Service was allowed to develop. A good start could be made on a maintenance expen-diture of  25,000 in the first year and the provision of one transmitter at a cost of  50,000.13. We are fully in agreement with the view of the B.B.C. that foreign language broadcasts, if started, must be introduced without prejudice to the Empire Service. So far as the tangible effect of a Foreign Service on the Empire Service is concerned, we see no particular difficulty in ensuring that the develop-ment of the latter service proceeds at a reasonable pace (which no doubt must to some extent be dependent upon the support accorded to it by Empire listeners), and that it should remain independent of the activities of the B.B.C. in the sphere of foreign language broadcasts. As regards the intangible effects, it has been argued before us that there may be some risk that Empire listeners, hearing broadcasts in a foreign language issuing from Daventry, may suspect them to be propaganda and may form the view that propaganda was being included in the Empire Service. It was stated that, on the inception of the Empire Service, there was a suspicion that it had formed a vehicle for Imperialist propaganda, but that this had now been entirely dispelled. For this reason the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs was anxious that foreign broadcasts should be dissociated as far as possible from the Empire Service, and that the position should be carefully watched from the point of view of their effect on that Service. The Director of Programmes of the B.B.C., who was in charge of the Empire Service, was apprehensive lest the success of that Service should be damaged.On this matter we hold the view that provided the B.B.C. arrange to dissociate as far as possible a foreign Service from the Empire Service as their representatives have assured us is quite practicable within certain limits the risk of prejudice to that Service on these grounds is small. We think that Empire listeners value the Empire Service because of its reliability and impartiality which they have proved by experience, and we see no reason to suppose that they will assume the B.B.C. will depart from its established standards because it is sending out bulletins in a foreign language. Moreover, so far as broadcasting in Arabic is concerned we feel that the Home country is fully entitled, if it thinks fit, to broadcast, in a language which can be understood by listeners, to any of the people forming part of or closely associated with the Empire.14. Our view, therefore, is that doubts regarding the effect on the Empire Service should not be a bar to the institution of foreign language broadcasts and we consider that on balance the arguments for starting such broadcasts in Arabic, Spanish and Portuguese, are convincing. So far as the two latter languages are concerned, we have no hesitation in recommending that the B.B.C. should accept full responsibility. As regards the first, there remains the question whether the B.B.C. would find it consistent with its charter status of impartiality and independence to give full weight to the views of the Foreign Office in the steps necessary to counter unfriendly and biased messages that may issue from time to time from other countries.15. Before hearing the views of the representatives of the B.B.C. we had already agreed that it was essential to preserve the principle that the Corporation should remain independent of political control and should not become, even in regard to foreign language broadcasts, merely the mouthpiece of His Majesty&apos;s Government. Both the Corporation and the Government must be able to state publicly, in answer to criticisms, that the Service in foreign languages is provided a,s a normal development of the B.B.C.&apos;s Services for which the recommendation
of the Ullswater committee* had prepared the way. In discussing this question with representatives of the B.B.C., who themselves, as we have stated, unanimously supported this principle, it became clear that they recognised that foreign language broadcasts and notably those in Arabic were on a somewhat different footing to those for reception at Home and in the Empire, and that in this sphere more intimate relations with the appropriate Government Department con-cerned should and could be established without any infringement of their independent status or derogation of their reputation for impartiality and integrity. Provided that ultimate responsibility for editing news bulletins and talks and for the method adopted for their delivery over the air rested solely with the Corporation, the Chairman and Sir John Reith were both prepared to take into account the special position of the Foreign Office in relation to foreign language broadcasts. They undertook to work in close touch with them and consult them in regard to staff and all other matters affecting foreign service. In the matter of Arabic broadcasting, Sir John Reith said that &quot;the B.B.C. might have to show more elasticity and perhaps be more amenable to Foreign Office views than in the case of other languages.&quot;16. If one of the objects of foreign language broadcasts is to be achieved, we think it is important that the B.B.C. should realise that, whilst preserving their independent status, they must pay a real and not a nominal regard to the views of the Foreign Office in relation to such broadcasts. If the attitude of the Corporation as disclosed at our meeting with them is maintained, we are sure that satisfactory relations between them and the Foreign Office can be expected. We think that the position would be assured as far as is practicable by a &quot; gentleman&apos;s agreement&quot; between them which would take the form of an exchange of letters between the Director-General of the B.B.C. and the Permanent Under-Secretary of State. Provided that a suitable undertaking in this form is obtained, we recommend strongly that all broadcasting in foreign languages that may be decided upon should be carried out from this country and by the B.B.C.17. Such a course would have immense advantages over any other which we have considered. Great Britain has a prestige of its own as a centre for the emission of world news. It is the natural place from which to correct untruths sent out from Rome. Though geographically distant from centres of Arabic culture, its cosmopolitan character and its resources should make it at least as easy and no more expensive to provide a suitable entertainment programme as would be the case in Cyprus. The capital outlay would not only be smaller than in either of those places, but the plant provided for such outlay could also be used for broadcasting in other languages besides Arabic. Finally, maintenance and control are both more easily effected here than they would be in the Near East.18. As regards finance, we consider that it would be most inadvisable for the Government to make a specific payment to cover the cost of a Foreign Service. If the Corporation expect the Government to pay for such a service &quot; ad hoc,&quot; they could not resist a demand that it should be controlled by the Government. The payment would have to be voted as a special item, entirely distinct from the normal vote for broadcasting, for which the Foreign Office, not the Post Office, would be responsible to Parliament, and the Corporation could not prevent a public acknowledgment that in this respect they were simply the mouthpiece of a Government Department. Such a position would, as we have already indicated, be intolerable both for the Corporation and the Government. We think that the proper course is to regard the expenses of the new service as a part of the normal expenses of sound broadcasting, and as such covered by the existing Agreement between the Postmaster-General and the B.B.C.We understand that the B.B-C. have already made representations to the Government that their existing revenue is no more than barely adequate for the provision of sound broadcasting services, including the Empire Service, on the present scale, and that additional Exchequer assistance is required if provision is to be made for the development of a suitable Television service : and that the Treasury have recognised the reasonableness of this claim in principle. That being sp, it seems to us difficult to deny the equity of the Corporation^ claim to receive some further assistance on account of the provision, partly, at any rate, on the Governments initiative, of a Foreign languages Service. We have not attempted to check the Corporation^ estimate of expenditure, and we realise&apos;* Cmd. 5091.
that the final settlement must be a matter for negotiation between the Post Office and the Treasury on the one hand and the Corporation on the other. But we think it only right that the Cabinet, in considering this Report, should assume that the greater part, if not the whole, of the cost of the new service is likely to fall ultimately on the Exchequer, in the form of an addition to the present Grant for Broadcasting under Class IV, Vote 12, for which the Postmaster-General is responsible to Parliament.19. Whether it will be necessary to present a Supplementary Estimate for this purpose in the current year is a question which will have to be considered by the Treasury in due course : we understand that it will depend not only on the progress made by the Government Departments and the B.B.C. in preparing their plans for the inauguration of the service, but also on considerations of constitutional propriety. But in any case it will be necessary to inform Parliament of the arrangements proposed and, in doing so, suitable stress can be laid upon the intention to maintain the independence of the B.B.C.Conclusions.20.   We recommend (1) That Cyprus should not be adopted as a centre at which to erect a station for Arabic Broadcasting.(2) that the Cabinet should accept the principle of broadcast messages in foreign languages being sent out from this country.(3) that these broadcasts should be carried out by the British Broadcasting Corporation, who should in principle retain, in respect of them, the same independent position that they possess in regard to their present broadcast services, and should accept responsibility for the delivery of all matter sent out in connection with broadcasts in foreign languages.(4) that, in practice, having regard to the special position of the Foreign Office in relation to broadcasts in a foreign language addressed to listeners in other countries, the Corporation should undertake to maintain close touch with that Department in all matters affecting such broadcasts particularly those in Arabic and to do their best to meet the Departments views. This understanding should be incorporated in a &quot; gentleman&apos;s agreement,&quot; which might take the form of an exchange of letters between the Director-General of the Corporation and the Permanent Under-Secretary of the Foreign Office.(5) that the Corporation should take all possible steps to dissociate broad-casts in a foreign language from the Empire Service.(6) that a start should be made as early as possible with broadcasts from this country in Spanish and Portuguese, and, subject to the completion of arrangements for a new transmitter, in Arabic.(7) that no special payment should be made to the Corporation from the Exchequer for broadcasts in a foreign language, but that any repre-sentations for financial assistance by the Corporation should be submitted on the basis of the existing Agreement between the Postmaster-General and the B.B.C. (Cmd. 5329), and should be considered by the Treasury and the Post Office on their merits. While the final settlement should be a matter for negotiation, it must be assumed that the greater part, if not the whole, of the cost of the new service will ultimately fall on the Exchequer.(8) that detailed arrangements for the new service should be worked out with the B.B.C. by the Departments concerned, viz.: The Treasury, the Foreign Office, the Dominions Office, the India Office, the Colonial Office and the Post Office.Signed on behalf of the Committee :KINGSLEY WOOD (Chairman).2 Whitehall Gardens, S.

APPENDIX.SECRET.A.B.C. (37) i.CABINET.COMMITTEE ON ARABIC BROADCASTING.Broadcasts in Spanish and Portuguese.Memorandum by Foreign Office.SOUTH AMERICA is at present the target of broadcasts in Spanish or Portuguese or both, from Germany, Italy, Russia, Japan, France, Holland and the United States. Since the Pan-American Congress of November 1936, the American broadcasting companies, in particular, have greatly strengthened their South American services, constructing new transmitters for the purpose and reorganizing their programmes. All these broadcasts are, of course, propaganda, that is to say, they aim at creating in the South American public, who are for the most part ignorant of any language but their own, a predisposition towards, and an admiration for, the countries from which they emanate, in the hope that the attitude of mind thus formed may sooner or later be turned to political and commercial account. In addition to the usual items of entertainment, the programmes contain direct political and commercial propaganda in the form of news bulletins which in their representation of world events and of internal events in the country from which the broadcast comes are designed to give the most favourable impression of that country&apos;s policy and material progress.2. The Foreign Office have for some time been concerned at the damage which British interests in South America are bound to suffer, if Great Britain&apos;s foreign competitors for influence and trade are allowed to monopolise the air. Naturally, they have regarded the question chiefly from the political point of view, from which, as the attitude of the South American States at the time of the Abyssinian crisis clearly showed, it is serious enough to deserve attention; but no doubt from the commercial point of view the consequences of neglect may be equally dangerous. At the moment, the only British news service for the Press reaching the greater part of South America is that of the British Official Wireless. Yet even if the position in this respect were better, it would not lessen the importance of the direct, immediate and authentic presentation of news which a broadcast news bulletin affords.3. In these circumstances the Foreign Office have consulted the B.B.C. and His Majesty&apos;s Representatives in the South and Central American countries with a view to establishing whether broadcasts in Spanish and Portuguese from Daventry would be acceptable and useful in Latin America; if so, whether it would be technically possible for the B.B.C. to fit such broadcasts into their existing system of services; and finally, whether, even if it were possible to arrange such broadcasts, there might not be reasons against our entering upon the field of open propaganda.4. So far as the first and second of these questions were concerned, no insuperable objections were met. The replies from His Majesty&apos;s Representatives were almost without exception favourable to the proposed broadcasts, particularly those from His Majesty&apos;s Representatives in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru. The B.B.C., for their part, stated that technically it would be possible
for them to fit Spanish and Portuguese news bulletins, eadh of 15 minutes&apos; duration,, in between the fifth and sixth transmissions of the Empire Service without impairing the efficiency of that service as at present organized. They added, however, the reservation that the insertion of such broadcasts into the Empire programme might, in certain circumstances, cramp that programme if at any time it were desired to extend it by closing the interval between the two transmis-sions in question. Apart from this reservation, it was clear both that the proposed new broadcasts would, in principle, be welcomed in South America, and that in practice they could, within certain limits, be given at an hour suitable for reception in that region. The only practical point in doubt was whether, given the shortness of the time which the B.B.C. could spare for these broadcasts, the-news bulletins would be able to make their effect, or whether, in order to capture the attention of listeners, they would not have to be supported by some kind of entertainment programme. Against this it may be argued, first, that the mere fact that news was being given out in Spanish and Portuguese by the B.B.C. direct from London would attract a number of listeners, and would certainly attract all those who were seriously interested in international affairs and whose opinion, even if they were not many in number, we should particularly wish to influence; and secondly, that, in view of this and of the urgent need for ensuring that our views should not remain altogether unrepresented, it would be better to start a news service in the immediate future, with the intention of expanding it later,*&apos; if expansion were shown to be necessary, rather than to allow the present state of dafault to continue until the point could be discussed in the light of all the ascertainable facts. Moreover, the delay entailed would probably be even greater than that required for investigation and discussion, since the half-hour period between two transmissions represents the most that, with their existing resources, the B.B.C. can allow without cutting into the Empire Service. Unless, therefore, that Service is to be impaired, any addition to the South American programme will require a new transmitter for the emission of that programme, since all the existing transmitters at Daventry are kept fully occupied by the Empire Service. A strong case can doubtless be made out for the addition of this extra transmitter, even apart from the present issue, but, even assuming that the money for it were immediately forthcoming, its erection would take time and the satisfaction of our needs in South America would be proportionately delayed still further. The choice therefore lies between, on the one hand, the immediate introduction of a limited news service, which will, at any rate, represent some advance on our present failure to keep abreast with our rivals, and, on the other hand, an indefinite period of discussion ending either in the introduction of the same limited service or, at a still later date, in the introduction of a service comprising both news and entertainment. It is not suggested that the desirability of a fuller programme should not be examined-indeed arrangements are being made for a representative of the B.B.C., who will shortly be visiting South America, to discuss the points at issue with His Majesty&apos;s Representatives there; what is suggested, however, is that since these discussions and the subsequent introduction, if necessary, of an extended programme must take a considerable time, it would be better, in view of the urgency of the need, to carry out at once those limited measures which are known to be practicable,, without prejudice to any later expansion of them.5. All that has been said so far rests on the assumption that the increasing number and length of broadcasts to South America in Spanish and Portuguese from countries outside that continent makes it desirable for this country to embark on similar, and competitive, action, and that the only point which needs to be discussed is how this action can most effectively be taken. This assumption has, however, been questioned in certain quarters and it will be necessary, if this step is to be taken, to consider certain of its implications. So far as His Majesty&apos;s Government are concerned, the necessity of broadcasting in foreign languages has already been accepted in connexion with the proposed Arabic broadcasts to Near Eastern countries. The present proposal, however, involves two new considera-tions, namely broadcasting in foreign languages by the B.B.C. and its possible effects on the Empire Service.   On both these points His Majesty&apos;s Government* a news service of this kind could be started on avowedly experimental lines, so that it could be expanded or at worst withdrawn later. The main necessity is to make an immediate start.[16007] c
will no doubt wish to receive the views of the Corporation : the main points in doubt have, however, already emerged in the discussions which have taken place between the Corporation and the interested Government Departments, and something may be briefly said of them here.6. The proposed broadcasts in Arabic (and possibly in Greek and Turkish also) will not be connected with the B.B.C.; nevertheless, the arguments in their favour have some bearing on the present case. It has been objected that broad-casts in foreign languages automatically discredit those who employ them and that, in consequence, the only result of this new departure will be to cast doubt on the veracity of His Majesty&apos;s Government or the B.B.C., whichever is responsible for the new broadcasts. To this argument there is a negative and a positive answer. The negative answer is that, since other countries are employing this medium, our only alternatives are to compete or to be left in the shade, since experience sbows that, if we keep silence, the result is not that we are respected for our integrity and reserve, but that we are ignored in favour of those who take the trouble to express their views. The positive answer is that good news drives out bad. We must assume in the case of Spanish and Portuguese broadcasts, as we have in the case of Arabic broadcasts, that the news service which we provide will be impartial, authoritative and up to date, and that reasonable utterances of this kind will in the end be more listened to and believed than pronouncements which are obviously partial, and will be better understood than an ambiguous silence. It is of no use to argue that, because foreign propaganda will defeat its own aim by its excesses, there is no need for us to do anything. Even apart from the danger of leaving the field free to our competitors, relying only on the presumption that they will act foolishly, there is a positive need for us to state our own case, which no one is likely to do for us, even if they spoil their own. Nor is there necessarily anything degrading in using the most effective and most modern means of making ourselves understood; if the manner is restrained and the matter reliable, there is no reason why broadcasts of this kind should not provide an additional reason for respecting British methods as well as an additional channel for explaining British views.7. The other main argument against these broadcasts is that their association with the Empire Service may prejudice the reputation of the latter among Empire listeners. The British High Commissioners in the Dominions were consulted when the desirability of foreign broadcasts was first discussed -with the B.B.C., and, with the exception of the British High Commissioner in New Zealand, they expressed the view that any foreign language broadcasts should be kept apart from the Empire Service. It,has already been shown that, if a news service only is broadcast, it will go out in one of the intervals between the Empire transmissions, and that, if a more extended programme is desired, a new transmitter may be needed. The foreign service will, therefore, be dissociated from the Empire Service as much as is practically possible. It may be said that in either case Empire listeners may pick up the broadcasts and may be disquieted at the emission from Daventry of what they will regard as propaganda. On the other hand, it would be a pity if an urgent political need could not be met merely on account of an illogical prejudice of this nature. It cannot be too much to hope that Empire listeners will continue to judge the B.B.C. on the merits of the service with which Daventry supplies them and will realise that we do not cease to speak truth when we speak in any language but our own.8. Finally, the objection may be dealt with that to admit broadcasting in Spanish and Portuguese is to open the door to demands for broadcasts in innumerable other foreign languages as well. As to this, all that need be said here is, first, that, so far as the Foreign Office are concerned, no request of this kind will be put forward that has not an urgent political necessity behind it; and, secondly, that at present no further request is foreseen. It is possible that, although the British High Commissioners in the Dominions have at the moment rejected the idea of broadcasts to the Empire in languages other than English (e.g., French and Afrikaans), requests for such broadcasts may be received when once it is known that such broadcasts are taking place to foreign countries. If this occurs, then presumably such broadcasts will have to be arranged within the Empire Service; in any case, the matter will be one for settlement between the Dominions Office and the B.B.C.
Foreign Office,September 13,1937.9.   To sum up, the following questions are submitted for decision: (a) whether any objection is seen in principle to the B.B.C. broadcasting inforeign languages. [In this connexion it may be recalled that among their conclusions the TJllswater Committee included a recommendation that &apos;&apos; In the interest of British prestige and influence in world affairs .... the appropriate use of languages other than English should be encouraged.&quot;](b) whether, if there is no such objection of principle, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment will be willing, in view of the present position as regards foreign broadcasts in South America, to recommend strongly to the B.B.C. the immediate introduction of a news service in Spanish and Portuguese to be followed, if necessary and if suitable arrangements can be made, by a more extended programme.Such a recommendation would, of course, be most seriously con-sidered by the Board of Governors of the B.B.C., who would represent their views to His Majesty&apos;s Government if they saw grave objection to its execution or wished to suggest amendments to it.In conclusion, a word may be said as to the financial aspect of this question. If the B.B.C. were to institute foreign language broadcasts as a result of a recom-mendation from His Majesty&apos;s Government based largely on political grounds, they would no doubt expect the extra expense in which they would be involved to be borne from Government funds. It is, of course, difficult to give an estimate of the cost of introducing Spanish and Portuguese broadcasts until the exact limits of the scheme are known, but on the assumption that it would at first consist only of news bulletins, it may be calculated, on the basis of figures supplied by the B.B.C., that the extra staff required (announcers, typists and their holiday reliefs) would cost in the neighbourhood of  2,000 per annum. In addition to this must be reckoned such further expenses as overhead charges, salary increments, and the cost of running the transmitters at Daventry for an additional period each day. A comprehensive estimate would, therefore, work out at between  2,000 and  3,000 a year. If a more elaborate programme were needed, and especially if such a programme required a new transmitter, the cost would, of course, be very much more; but all it is desired to press for at the moment though this request is urgent is the restricted service outlined above. An additional reason for action in the immediate future is the necessity for establishing a claim to suitable wave-lengths. At present, while His Majesty&apos;s Government are restricting their action in the international field to broadcasts in English, other countries who are broad-casting in a great number of foreign languages are acquiring wave-lengths on which to do so. If this process continues, it will very soon be difficult to obtain adequate wave-lengths for ourselves. It is therefore most desirable to take an early decision on this question of principle, and certainly in time for action to be taken at the Wave-length Conference which is due to meet in Cairo next February.
