[This Document is the Property oi His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1937.Copy No...S?CABINET.Provision against Civil Emergency in India.Draft Revolutionary Movements Ordinance.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.I circulate for the information of my colleagues a Note containing a summary of the provisions of a draft Revolutionary Movements Ordinance which the Governor-General has had drawn up in consultation with Provincial Governors as a measure ready for immediate application should an emergency arise. The preparation of this Ordinance was first put in hand in the early months of this year at a time when, as the result of the refusal by Congress to accept office except on the receipt of assurances which it was constitutionally impossible to give them, the Governor-General was apprehensive that he might be faced at any moment with a grave constitutional crisis in which the authority of Government might be challenged by a widespread Congress campaign of a civil disobedience nature. The possibility of such a crisis disappeared, I am glad to say, for the time being at any rate, with the decision in July of Congress .to accept office, and up to the present time the Congress Ministries, while evincing a desire to go ahead as rapidly as possible with their own programmes, have shown a disposition to avoid the creation of deadlocks with the Governors, and are conducting themselves with a reasonable spirit of accommodation. At the same time it must not be forgotten that Congress as a whole, and the higher command of Congress iu particular, remains bitterly opposed to the Government of India Act and makes no secret of its intention to &quot; mend it or end it.&quot; There is, moreover, reason to believe that both Nehru, the Congress President, and Gandhi, who still remains the power behind the throne, regard another conflict between Congress and Government as inevitable sooner or later, and that they have acquiesced in the present policy of acceptance of office largely with a view to utilising the situation to strengthen the hold of Congress on the country generally and to perfect their organisations, so that when the time comes for a trial of strength with Government they may have the fullest possible measure of support behind them. They are, it may be mentioned, exercising a very strict control over the policy and actions of the Provincial Ministries. In a recent report on Nehru&apos;s activities it was stated that he has been preaching the need for a drastic agrarian policy and for preparation for a mass civil disobedience movement against Government, a feature of which should be a general strike accompanied by widespread agrarian disturbances.2. In these circumstances the Governor-General feels that it is essential that he and the Provincial Governors should be placed in a position to take immediate and effective action should an emergency of the kind indicated arise. The success with which the second outbreak of the civil disobedience movement was suppressed in 1932 was largely due to the fact that the Government of India had Ordinances containing the necessary emergency powers ready for immediate promulgation, and were thus able to act with speed and resolution at the very outset of the movement before it had had time to gather momentum. An examination of the powers that are now available to deal with a sudden emergency has shown that the various Provinces are unequally armed in this respect. Some Provinces have reasonably effective Acts which were placed on the Statute Book when the Ordinances of 1932 expired; other Provinces have no such legislation, and no Provinces are f ully armed with all the powers which could and should be employed to crush a really powerful attempt to overthrow the Constitution. The Governor-General, therefore, decided that it was preferable to prepare a comprehensive measure for general application rather than to attempt to fill in the gaps in existiug local legislation. As the subjects dealt with in the draft Ordinance fall wholly within the Provincial Legislative List, it will not be open to the Governor-General to issue the Ordinances under his own Ordinance-making powers, and it would be necessary for each Provincial Governor to issue the Ordinance separately for his own Province, as the secret.CP. 254 (37).
situation might demand. It would no doubt be necessary to issue the Ordinance earlier in Provinces where Congress influence is stronger than in other Provinoes, but it is improbable that it would be possible to avoid its application eventually in. ail Provinces, since Provinces which did not possess these powers would be liable to be used as a base by the organisers of the movement. It may, however, be possible for some Provinces to. dispense with certain of the provisions of the Ordinance, and in issuing the Ordinance for his own Province it will, of course, be open to any Governor, subject to the approval of the Governor-General, to make certain variations according to his own particular needs. I should perhaps add that it is not contemplated that the powers of this Ordinance shall be exercised on the advice of Ministers. The situation under contemplation is one of grave emergency in which no Legislature would be prepared to enact the necessary legislation, and in which consequently no Ministry exercising these powers could remain in office -and enjoy the confidence of a majority in the Legislature. It is probable that before issuing this Ordinance, the Governor would have found it necessary to issue a proclamation under section 93 of the Government of India Act, thereby assuming control of the administration of his Province. We may therefore be assured that, if these drastic powers ever do have to be employed, they will be used with discretion and moderation and that there is no danger of their being-misused for purposes for which they are not intended.3. Turning to the actual provisions of the Ordinance, which are of a far-reaching nature, I need add little to the summary contained in the Note. The draft incorporates all that was found useful in the Ordinances promulgated in 1932 to deal with the last Civil Disobedience Movement, and in addition adopts certain provisions from the United Kingdom Public Order Act of 1936 and the regulations made by the High Commissioner in Palestine in 1936 under Article 4 of the Palestine (Defence) Order in Council, 1931. As regards the definition in clause 2 of the Revolutionary Movements Ordinance, the basic principle has been to make provisions directed against persons acting in furtherance of any revolu-tionary movement irrespective&apos; of whether they are acting individually or as members of any organisation, or whether a particular organisation can be identified as having as its object the promotion of a particular subversive movement. It is impossible to anticipate the precise lines on which a new subversive movement may develop, and it may develop on more lines than one. In clause 2 (3), therefore, the object has been to define a &quot;revolutionary movement&quot; comprehensively in terms of the objects which its promoters may seek ultimately to achieve and of the methods they may adopt to that end. Whether an attempt to achieve certain objects is a &quot; revolutionary movement &quot; is made to depend on the methods adopted ; these methods are precisely specified and have been defined as &quot;revolutionary activities.&quot; In addition to the general definition of a &quot; revolutionary movement &quot; there is in clause 2 (3) provision for a Provincial Government to declare any movement to be a revolutionary movement. This is necessary to enable a Provincial Government to take action against persons promoting or engaging in a movement which ostensibly is not a &quot; revolutionary movement &quot; within the terms of the general definition, but which, from the information in their possession, the Provincial Government know is being promoted in furtherance of the general revolutionary programme.4. The most important powers contained in the Ordinance are the provisions for the arrest without warrant of revolutionary suspects (section 3) and for the control of their movements (section 4); the power to confiscate money (section 5) and to take possession of places used for revolutionary purposes (section 6); the far-reaching control of publications (sections 7 and 13) which extends to requiring the publication of any matter supplied by a specified authority and to the immediate suppression of any particular publication Or Press; the power to control local authorities (section 10) and educational institutions (section 11) (these two sections are new and did not appear in the 1932 Ordinances); the Control of posts and telegraphs by District Magistrates (section 26); the imposition of collective fines on. the inhabitants of turbulent areas (section 29); the power to stop boycotting (section 49) and the wearing of uniforms and emblems (section 52); and the arrangements, for setting up special Courts consisting of special Judges, special Magistrates and Summary Courts equipped with special powers of procedure in. chapter 4. Provision is made for appeals against the sentences of all three classes of special Courts.
The penalty for taking part in a revolutionary movement or for indulging in revolutionary activities is severe, extending to seven years&apos; imprisonment for the more serious kinds of revolutionary activity. The Governor-General is, however, satisfied that a maximum of seven years is necessary for the more serious offences, and has pointed out that under the Indian Penal Code certain, similar offences are punishable with transportation or ten years&apos; imprisonment.5. As I have explained above, it is to be hoped that with the acceptance of office by Congress the occasion for the use of such an Ordinance as this may never arise, hut in view of the necessity for immediate action at the outset in the event of an emergency, the Governor-General has submitted the draft Ordinance for my approval at this stage, and before giving my approval I feel that I should let my colleagues know the line of policy which is proposed. I am not asking now for formal approval for the issue of the Ordinance if the emergency should arise, but I should like to be in a position to inform the Governor-General that His Majesty&apos;s Government has approved generally the application of a measure on these lines as a matter of policy in the event of the occurrence of a widespread revolutionary movement directed against Government, on the understanding that if the occasion arises the matter will be brought before the Cabinet again before final approval is given to the issue of the Ordinance.. Z.India Office, 21st October 1937.NOTE ON THE REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENTS ORDINANCE.An Ordinance to confer Special Poivers on Government and its Officers for the purpose of preventing a grave menace to the Peace and Tranquillity of the Province.The first chapter of the Ordinance consists mainly of a definition of &quot; revolu-tionary movements &quot; and &quot; revolu tionary activities &quot; against which the Ordinance -is directed, and the relevant sections, section 2 (3) and (4), read as follows:- &quot; 2. In this Ordinance, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context, 0 0 * 0(3) &apos; Revolutionary movement&apos; means any concerted endeavour to over-throw or produce any change in the existing industrial, agrarian or economic structure, or to overthrow or produce any change in the existing form of government by the doing of or attempting to do or. the abetting of any unlawful act or any of the following acts, namely : (a) Using force or violence or threatening force or violence ;(b) Any act intended or likely to (i) seduce any member of the military, naval or air forces of the Crown or any member of a police force from his allegiance or his duty, or dissuade any person from enlisting therein, or persuade any person to resign therefrom, or to prejudice the recruiting of persons to servo therein or the training, discipline or administration thereof;(ii) bring into hatred or contempt His Majesty or the Government by law established in British India or the administration of justice in British India, or any class or section of His Majesty&apos;s subjects in British India, or excite disaffection towards His Majesty or the said Government;(iii) usurp or promote the usurpation of any power or function of Government or of the Legislature or of any local authority or of any court or of any public servant as defined in section 21 of the Indian Penal Code, or of any village officer ;(iv) promote feelings of enmity or hatred among His Majesty&apos;s. subjects;(v). encourage or incite any person or class of persons or the public generally to interfere with the administration of the law or with th&amp;: 6610 A 2
maintenance of law and order, or to commit -anyoffence, or to refuse or defer payment of any land revenue, tax, rate, cess or other due or amount payable to. Government or ,any local authority, or payable under law or custom having the force of law for any services rendered to the community or any rent of agricultural land mr anything recoverable as arrears of or along with such rent;(vi) induce a public servant or a servant of a local authority or any person employed in or in connection with an undertaking specified in the Schedule, to do any act or forbear or delay to do any act connected with the exercise of his employment or to resign his employment;(vii) dissuade any person from entering the service of the Crown or of a local authority or from accepting employment in or in connection with any undertaking specified in the Schedule ;(viii) encourage or incite a public servant or a servant of a local authority or any person employed in or in connection with an under-taking specified in the Schedule to take part in any strike or stoppage of work;(ix) encourage or incite any persons to combine in any concerted action with a view by reason of the concerted nature of the action to. exert pressure on Government or on the public or any section or member of the public or to interfere with the lawful actions of any person ;Revolutionary movement includes any movement which the Provincial Govern-ment by notification in the Official Gazette declares to be a revolutionary movement for the purposes of this Ordinance.&apos;(4) ^Revolutionary activity&apos; means the doing of or attempting to do or the abetting of any unlawful act or any act referred to in subclauses (a) and (6) of clause (3) in such circumstances as to tend directly or indirectly to further or assist a revolutionary movement.&quot;Chapter II enumerates the special powers assumed by Government. ^Sections 3 and 4 give the Provincial Government or District Magistrates power to arrest without warrant and control the movements of revolutionary suspects. The power of a District Magistrate to keep a suspect in custody is limited to one month, though the Provincial Government, may extend the time to three months, and any orders passed by a District Magistrate to control the movements of a suspect can only remain in force for three months unless the Provincial Government otherwise directs. These powers were a feature of the 1932 Ordinances and have been proved by experience to be essential. Their object is to enable District Magistrates to take rapid and extensive action to immobilise for short periods persons engaged in revolutionary activities. For longer periods the sanction of the Provincial Government is required.Section 5 gives power to prevent funds being sent from outside the Province to assist a revolutionary movement tmd to confiscate funds which are being so used ; in order to - carry these provisions into effect, the Provincial Government may authorise officers to search premises and can demand information from banks or other persons.Section 6 similarly gives power to take possession of buildings and property which are being used for revolutionary purposes.Sections 7, 8 and 9 give Government power to declare newspapers, books and other documents encouraging a revolutionary movement forfeited and to issue search warrants for them, and to detain packages containing such documents and other articles transmitted by the post. These powers are similar to those contained in the Indian Press Emergency Powers Act of 1931, but are rather wider in scope.Section 10 and the following sections contain powers which have not been used before in such Ordinances in India. Section 10 gives the Provincial Government power to control local authorities and enables it to dismiss from office and to replace any member of a local authority of which the administration is being conducted in a manner conducive to the furthering of revolutionary activity.Under section 11 the Provincial Government is empowered to close any educational institution, to remove persons from the managing bodies of such
institutions, to dismiss any teacher or expel any student, and to withhold Government grants.Section 12 enables a District Magistrate by written order to prohibit the exhibition of any film, and also any dramatic or Other performance, or to require that a specified film shall be shown as part of any given performance and he advertised as such.Under section 13 the Provincial Government may prohibit the printing of any newspaper or ptiblication or the use of any press absolutely or for a specified period; may require that any matter relating to a particular class of subjects shall be submitted for scrutiny before publication ; and may require the publication in&apos; any newspaper or periodical of matter supplied by a specified authority, with instructions as to the manner in which publication shall be made. This section is taken from the Palestine Emergency Regulations of 1936 and is designed to give Government immediate and complete control of the Press both with a view to the suppression of revolutionary propaganda and to the use of the Press for their own publicity and propaganda.The remaining poivers given by Chapter II are practically all revivals of those used in 1932. Section 14 gives power to the District Magistrate to take possession of buildings if they are required by public servants, troops or police in order to give effect to the Ordinance, and section 15 gives similar powers with regard to movable property.. Section 16 gives power to control the supply of a commodity of general use by means of compelling traders to give an account of their stocks, fixing maximum prices for commodities and expropriating supplies from traders at the fixed price. Sections 17 and 19 give the District Magistrate power to limit Or prohibit access to certain places, buildings, &amp;c.;- and to regulate traffic. Under section 18 Government may take control of certain undertakings essential to the public, including public utility organisations, and may require an employer in such an undertaking to dismiss any person suspected of revolutionary activities.Sections 20, 21 and 22 provide for control by District Magistrates over the&apos; means of transport, over the use of railways and vessels, and over the distribution and use of petrol, oil, &amp;c. Section 23 gives the District Magistrate power to impose curfew, and section 24 to prohibit drilling. Section 25 arms the District Magistrate with control over the sale, purchase or possession of arms and ammunition, Avhile section 26 enables him to assume control over posts and telegraphs, including the power to intercept any postal article, including money orders, and any telephone or wireless messages.Sections 27 to 35 give various powers to the authorities in their relation tO&apos; the general public. These are powers to employ special constables and to require the assistance of private persons for certain purposes; to impose a collective fine on the inhabitants of a turbulent area (this power appeared in the 1932 Ordinances, but has been amplified on the lines of the Palestine Regulations to provide for the imposition of a collective fine where the inhabitants Of an area are harbouring persons concerned in the commission of offences or are failing to render assistance to discover the offenders); to prohibit public meetings or processions&apos; (this is based on section 3 of the Public Order Act, 1936) ; to secure reports of public meetings ; to issue search warrants, and to search both places and&apos; persons with a view to intercepting messages ; and a general power to take Such action as may be thought necessary to enforce orders of this nature.Sections 36 to 39 provide for the setting up of tribunals of three persons to consider the claims of persons who have suffered loss through their property being commandeered in accordance with the provisions of the Ordinance and also applications for the review of orders under section 5 confiscating money or other valuables.Section 40 deals with the procedure for service of orders in Writing tinder the Ordinance. Section 41 empowers the Provincial Government to invest any Sub-Divisional Magistrate or any police officer not below the rank of Deputy Superintendent with the powers of a District Magistrate under this Chapter, while a District Magistrate may in a specified area, or for a specified emergency, delegate his powers to any officer. In both cases an exception is made of the powers under section 4 to pass orders controlling the movements of suspects.Chapter III prescribes penalties for offences Under the Ordinance. For engaging in any revolutionary activity or in furtherance of a revolutionary movement the penalty is imprisonment up to three years, or a fine, or both, and if the revolutionary activity includes violence, seducing members Of the Forces from their allegiance,
exciting disaffection towards His Majesty or the Government or usurping Govern-mental functions, or the promotion of enmity among His Majesty&apos;s subjects, the-maximum sentence of imprisonment is seven years. These penalties are more severe than those laid down for similar offences under the 1932 Ordinances, but it-may he mentioned that under the Indian Penal Code offences such as conspiracy to overawe Government by criminal force or seducing members of the Forces from their allegiance are punishable with transportation for life or with imprisonment up to 10 years and fine.For disobedience of an order under section 4 the penalty is two years, and for evasion of the provision for the taking possession of property, one year&apos;s imprison-ment. Dissemination of rumours likely to cause alarm to the public or to defame Government and its officers or to further; a revolutionary movement is punishable with one year&apos;s imprisonment and fine. The object is to penalise the publication of any statements calculated to harm and embarrass Government or its officers and no distinction is drawn between true and false rumours on the ground that as much harm can be done by true reports likely to cause public alarm or to defame Government-as by false ones. For the possession of proscribed documents or the dissemination of their contents, for boycotting of public servants and participation in a mock funeral ceremony, two methods used in the past by Congress to harass Government officers, the penalty is six months&apos; imprisonment or fine. Sections 51 and 52 are based on the Public Order Act, 1936, and penalise membership of a quasi-military organisation or displaying prohibited uniforms, flags or emblems, the penalty being six months&apos; imprisonment or fine. Section 53 is taken from the Palestine Regulations and provides a new offence, sabotage on a scheduled undertaking, the penalty for which extends to five years&apos; imprisonment. Under section 54 the punishment for abetment of an offence is the same as that for the offence itself. Section 55 gives power to direct that the fine imposed on a young person may he paid by his parent or guardian, and section 56 that the secretary or manager may be fined in the case of an offence committed by an association or corporation, unless he proves that it was done without his knowledge.Chapter IV of the Ordinance revives the Special Criminal Courts set up by the Emergency Powers Ordinance of 1932. These courts are of three classes, Special Judges, Special Magistrates and Summary Courts. Special Judges may try such offences as the Provincial Government may direct and may pass any sentence authorised by law, but an appeal lies in the case of a sentence of death, trans-portation or imprisonment for two years or more, in the same manner as an appeal against a sentence passed by a Court of Session.Special Magistrates, who must be Presidency or First Class Magistrates, may impose sentences not including sentences of death, transportation or imprisonment exceeding seven years, and an appeal lies either to the High Court (where the case is tried in a Presidency town) or to the Sessions Court. As regards Summary Courts, the Provincial Government may authorise any magistrate to exercise the powers of a Summary Court and to try such cases as are entrusted to him by the District Magistrate. Such Courts may pass any sentence which may be passed by a Magistrate of the first class. Appeals from the sentences of Summary Courts will lie either to the Special Judge of the area or to the High Court or Sessions Court.ISo Court constituted under the Ordinance may try any offence except an offence under the Ordinance, and no other Court shall have any power of interference, except as provided for in the matter of appeals. Special powers are given to the Special Courts to deal with refractory accused, e.g. hunger strikers or persistent obstructors, and to exclude the public, and there is provision for special rules of procedure for recovering fines and a special rule of evidence admitting statements recorded by a magistrate from persons who have died or disappeared or who are incapable of giving evidence, if the Court is of opinion that such death, disappearance or incapacity has been caused in the interests of the accused.Chapter V provides that certain liabilities, including taxes, rates, cess or rent may, in specified areas, be declared to be notified liabilities, and arrears of such notified liabilities may be recovered, under the orders of the Collector, as if they were land revenue.   These provisions are taken from the 1932 Ordinance.Chapter &quot;VI contains certain supplemental provisions taken from the 1932 Ordinances, and makes all offences punishable under the Ordinance cognisable and non-bailable. It further provides that a notification to that effect by Government is conclusive proof that any specified movement is a revolutionary movement, and bars the jurisdiction of all other Courts in respect of any act done under the; Oidinance. /6610Wt 8177/KDP 8   85   10.87
