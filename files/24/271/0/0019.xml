THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.SECRET. A copy NO.     J:iCP. 819(57).CABINET.INDIAN TRADE NEGOTIATIONS... Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.Negotiations between ourselves and representatives of the Government of India have heen taking place at the Board of Trade since June for the revision of the Ottawa Agreement which the Government of India had denounced on the motion of the Indian Legislative Assembly.      These negotiations have recently been resumed after a short recess and have now reached the point at which it is possible to see the sort of agreement which at present the Government of India are prepared to commend to the Indian Legislature.      It will be remembered that&quot; at Ottawa the Government of India granted preferences on trade which in 1936 was worth  13 million to the United Kingdom.It now emerges that the major Indian demand is that we should surrender preferences on trade which in 1936 was worth  10,500,000.      In addition, they demand   a guarantee of unrestricted free entry for Indian jute manufactures (as for other Indian manufactures) and certain important concessions connected with the administration of United Kingdom duties, e.g.  the withdrawal of drawback on linseed oil.      In return they would be prepared to reach an agreement with the Lancashire cotton interests giving them some unspecified concessions on the entry of cotton goods into India..To show:-how wide is the gap between what India demands and what I regard as being a reasonable bargain I may say
that the hind of agreement which I was &quot;beginning to envisage as a result of somewhat protracted negotiations was one in which we,  in return for a satisfactory settlement on cotton and rayon, and some undertaking limiting the imports of jute manufactures into this country, would give up our -Ottawa preferences on a number of comparatively small items of trade amounting to a total of about  600,000 on which the Indian Delegation refused even to consider the continuance of preference.      I should have been willing in addition to consider giving up our preferences on hardware and certain non-ferrous metals, of considerable importance to our trade, which would bring the total trade covered to  1,700,000.    My colleagues will realise that such an agreement would do nothing for the numerous United Kingdom exporters whose interests were not adequately covered by the Ottawa Agreement.and who have been looking forward to the present negotiations to effect an improvement in their position.On the one side therefore we have an agreement as envisaged by the Indian Delegation under which, in return for some further unspecified reduction in the duty on our cotton and rayon goods in India, we should give up nearly 5/6ths of the preferences we now enjoy under the Ottawa Agreement, should leave Dundee with no hope of any restriction on the entry of Indian jute manufactures into the United Kingdom and, probably, should give an undertaking still further to increase our consumption of Indian cotton.      On the other side we have the agreement which I should have been prepared, with some hesitation,  to recommend to my colleagues for acceptance, under which we should surrender about one-eighth of our preferences and should receive some satisfaction&apos; on cotton and rayon in India and some restriction on the entry of Indian jute manufactures into the United Kingdom.
The settlement of the Lancashire cotton piece goods problem in India on terms satisfactory to all parties is an object for which it would be -worth paying a considerable price even if as I fear that settlement would not in itself immediately or even ultimately promote an expansion of our cotton exports commensurate with the sacrifice demanded from the rest of our trade with India.      There is, however, a point at which the price which we are asked to pay for a settlement of the cotton problem is so far out of proportion to the economic value of the concessions granted in return that the gap between tne two sets of values cannot be bridged by the political importance attaching to a settlement of the issue.    This limit seems likely to be so greatly exceeded by the number and value of the preferences which the Government of India propose to withdraw from the list in the Ottawa Agreement, which the spokesmen of the Government of India themselves described in the debate in the Assembly as being at least.as favourable to India as to the United Kingdom that I fear I have no alternative but to inform the Indian delegate that I could not commend to the Cabinet or to Parliament a settlement of this kind.My colleagues should, however, be aware that in the last few days, immediately following upon the disclosure to us of the full extent of the Indian demands and the realisation by the Indian Delegation that we should find difficulty in meeting them, Lancashire has been made aware by the unofficial advisers to the Indian Delegation of the nature of the demands which that Delegation are putting forward.    By promising Lancashire serious consideration of their claims - though without disclosing what exact concessions they are willing to offer for a satisfactory agreement - the unofficial advisers have induced the cotton interests to bring pressure
to &quot;bear on the Board of Trade to conclude an agreement such as the Indians desire, whatever may he the price to be paid &quot;by other British industries.    If therefore we refuse to pay the price    demanded &quot;by the Indian Delegation for a concession to Lancashire, we are likely to be faced almost immediately by strong political pressure and, when our decision becomes known, by a public campaign of considerable violence.O.F.G.S.Board of Trade.25th September, 1937.
