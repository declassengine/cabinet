t(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) S E C RET.C .P.201(37)Copy No.....o. .&quot;C A B I N E T .AIR RAIDS PRECAUTIONS EXPENDITURE . Memorandum by the Home Secretary ,1. I circulate for the information of the Cabinet atranscript of the shorthand notes of a meeting which the Secretary of State for Scotland and I had with representatives of Local Authorities&apos; Associations in pursuance of Cabinet 29 (37),  Conclusion 7 .2. Since then I have been considering, in consultationwith some of my colleagues,  possible alternatives to the proposal which was put to that meeting, viz. that in addition to the commitments already undertaken by the Government,  the Government should pay 5Q% of the expenditure, both recurring and non-recurring,  on air raids precautions services, representing over the whole field an estimated contribution of 10%.3. On the basis of the provisional estimates submittedto the Defence Policy and Requirements Committee in Paper D.P.R. 181 (appended to CP * 112(37));,   this proposal involved -A. Acceptance, as a charge to the Exchequer,  of the whole of the necessary expenditure on respirators, protective clothing, bleach powder, etc.,  estimated to amount, in the aggregate,  to. not less than eight million pounds;B. Payment of Exchequer grants at the rate of 50 per cent, in aid of approved expenditure under the following main heads:-
Organising staff, (roughly estimated at  750 per annum per 100,000 population) 300,000 per annum.(2)Expenses of anti-gas training........... 450,000 per annum.(3)Fire brigades,  administrative and miscellaneous expenses. . 550,000 per annum.Total 1,300,000 per annum.(These figures would be greatly reduced after twoor threeyears) .(4)Fire Brigade training expenses.. 2,200,000(Reducible to a much smaller sum after two or threeyears) .(5)    New buildings and conversion and adaptation of existing buildings...................... 4,628,000 (capital)(6)   Equipment for fire fighting,decontamination, treatment of casualties, warning signalsand street lighting............ 5,897,000 (capital)C. Possible arrangement of exceptional terms for certain special items, e.g., fire appliances;D. Treatment of expenditure on base hospitals as a &quot;largely national obligation&quot;.4. Apart from (D), and making no allowance for exceptionalterms under (C), the financial liability of the Local Authorities would, under this proposal, have been limited to one half of(a)  1,300,000 (recurrent expenditure as at (1),   (2) and (3) above)    .    650,000(b)  2,200,000 (non-recurrent expenditure as at (4) above: not being of the nature of 5,262,500 1,100,000
The annual loan charges on the estimated capital expenditure of  5,262,500 have been assessed by the   Ministry of Health at approximately - 487,750 for the first five years: 483,300 for the second five years: and thereafter,  during the next twenty years, at amounts varying from  146,350 to  54,400.5. The annual liability falling on Local Authoritiesduring the initial period would thus have amounted in all to 650,000 (recurrent expenditure). 1,100,000 (non-recurrent expenditure:    not being of the nature of capital expenditure). 487,750 (annual loan charges).Total        2,237,750, or somewhat less than the product of a _   2d. rate.(It should be noted that any expenditure on this account borne by rates in the years 1940-41, 1945-46,  1950-51, etc., would automatically increase the annual block grant for the ensuing five years by about 22-g- per cent, of such expenditure) ,6. It seems clear that if agreement is to be reachedit will be necessary to make some new offer which, whilst not relieving the Local Authorities of the whole burden of expenditure, would be substantially more favourable to them than the offer already made, and I suggest for consideration the following three alternatives:-A. Payment of grants from the Exchequer at the rate of 75 per cent, of approved expenditure under the main headings (l) to (6)  shown above.B. Acceptance by the Central Government, as a charge to the Exchequer,  of the whole of the capital
expenditure required under headings (5) and (6) above and of so much of the expenditure of  2,200,000 under heading (4) above as represents the total cost of the equipment to &quot;be provided for auxiliary firemen (approximately  1,500,000):    subject to the Secretary of State being satisfied in each case that the Local Authority concerned is effectively carrying out the approved Scheme and, in particular, is making effective arrangements for recruitment and training; and is prepared, at its own cost, to meet all necessary administrative expenses and all necessary charges for . maintenance of buildings and equipment. C.   As in (B) above, with the exception that the Central Government would make grants from the Exchequer, not exceeding 50 per cent, in aid of the administrative expenses and maintenance charges falling on the Local Authorities .7 . The broad effect of alternative (A) would be toreduce by one half the financial liability of the Local Authorities as indicated in paragraph 5 above.8. Under alternative (B),  the liability of the LocalAuthorities would be limited (on the basis of the provisional estimates in D.P.R. 181) to the annual charge of  1,300,000 shown under headings (l),  (2) and (3) above, plus an amount of approximately  700,000 (being the difference between the sum of  2,200,000 shown under heading (4) above, and the sum of approximately  1,500,000 required for auxiliary firemen&apos;s equipment).     As stated above,  the liability qf the local authorities under these heads would be greasy reduced after two or three years .9- Under alternative (c), the liability of the local

HOME SECRETARY.      , Gentlemen,  I should like to say, first of all, how very glad I am to have the chance of meeting all your representatives from England and Wales and also our friends from Scotland.     I must apologise for having given you rather short notice,  particularly those gentlemen who have come from a distance, hut I was very anxious to have a meeting &quot;before we all separated for the Recess,  and to take our discussions as far as we can towards a settlement.     Now, another apology I would like to make is that we have not been able to meet sooner. There has been a good deal of delay since first we issued circulars about Air Raid Precautions from the Home Office, but I can assure you that that delay has really been unavoidable. I have had, at one time and another, a good deal to do with defence questions,  perhaps as much as anybody in active politics - seven years at the Air Ministry,  a year at the Admiralty, five years dealing with the Army at the India Office -and I can honestly say to you that I have never been faced with a more formidable or more complicated series of defence questions than are the questions connected with Air Raid Precautions, and the fact that it is only now that we are able to meet you is really due to the great complexity of the problem.      I expect a good many gentlemen here have studied it and they will agree with me when I say that from every point of view it is just about as difficult a defence question as has ever faced any of us;    for instance,  let me suggest to you the two questions that seem to me to be so extraordinarily difficult at the outset. First of all, against what kind of scale of attack ought we to be making any preparations?     Secondly, who should be responsible for this new defence service?
With the other defence questions we usually had some fairly definite data, but in this particular question we have got little that is of great value to us.     If you take the experience of the War, you will remember that air raids over these shores were then altogether insignificant, and that in the whole course of the War only 300 tons of bombs were dropped upon these shores.     Since then there have been tremendous developments of aviation and tremendous developments of the methods of air warfare, and if we made an arithmetical estimate based upon the War figures of the kind of attack with which we might now be confronted we should really get into astronomical figures,  so astronomical indeed that I know that there are a number of people in the country who say &quot;Here, now, is a problem so formidable, so intractable,  so inscrutable, that it is not worth doing anything to meet it at all, that whatever we do the air attack will be able to get through and the measures of defence will be ineffective&quot;.     Well, Gentlemen, I hope very much that nobody here will take that view.      I can give you my own opinion for what it is worth, and it is an opinion based not upon theory but upon a very close study of these problems over a good many years.      I do not at all take the view that defence against air attack is hopelessly ineffective.      I take the view rather that in the whole field of Defence there is always this contest going on between the attack and the defence, and that sometimes the attack gets the better of the defence and then afterwards the defence catches up upon the attack.     Now, what has been happening in the last three or four years is a great advance on the side of the defence.     The problem of the defence is now so different from what it was at the end of the War that it is not worth taking the War experience as the data upon which to base your conclusions.     Every kind of method of defence has in recent years very much improved.     The anti-aircraft gun, for instance, is something quite different from-2-
what it was at the end of the War.      The training and the handling are very different from what they were at the end of the War.      In addition to that there are many other new developments, many of them very secret, and I think you can take it from me that the defence has now made so great an advance,  that provided we have a strong enough Air Force for the main purposes of attack, and I think we are going to have an Air Force strong enough for these purposes provided we carry out the very large programme upon which we are now engaged; provided also that we develop effectively our anti-aircraft measures of various kinds; provided also we can together co-operate upon an effective scheme of Air Raid Precautions, the effect of which will he two-fold, namely,  to stop panic amongst the civil population, and,  secondly,  to keep the essential services of civilised life going,  I believe we can make this country so unattractive a target for any other country to attack,  that the other country will think a good many times before it launches an attack upon us, and it is interesting to note in this connection that in Berlin (some of my staff have just come back from a visit to Berlin, where incidentally they have been shewn in great detail the anti-air attack preparations)  the citizens of Berlin,  they tell me, are now so confident first of all about his Air Force, about his anti-aircraft organisation and,  thirdly, about his air raid precautions, that they do not believe that Berlin will ever be attacked.     Well, Gentlemen, that may be an extreme view, but it has this measure of truth behind it, that with these double preparations, both in the air and on the ground, we can,  I believe, get a security that none of us would have imagined possible say even five years ago.      I hope,  therefore,  that as a result of our discussions here none of us will go away with the view that these complicated precautions upon which we are now engaging ourselves are going to be ineffective. -
How I come to the second big issue.     Supposing we are now going to adopt a great scheme of Air Raid Precautions, should it be a local scheme, that is to say, founded upon local individual plans, financed from the rates, or should it he a national scheme,  centralised finance from the national funds of the taxes.     Now, Gentlemen, a very good argument can he made for answering the question in either way.     It can he said that Air Raid Precautions are an essential part of national defence, and that just as the State is responsible for the Navy, the Army and the Air Porce, so the State should &quot;be responsible for Air Raid Precautions.     On the other hand it can just as effectively be replied that Air Raid Precautions cover a wide field, that to a great extent is already administered &quot;by local bodies.     It can also be pointed out that there is this difference between Air Raid Precautions and Navy, Army and Air Porce defences, that in the case of Air Raid Precautions they are localised in the particular area, the State cannot transfer them from one place to another, and thirdly,  it can equally he pointed out that so far as I know in no great country where these preparations are being made is the obligation exclusively a national obligation.     I have made careful enquiries into the subject, and they all go to show that taking in particular the two most conspicuous instances, the instances of Germany and Prance, there the State is making a contribution but the localities are finding a substantial part of the expense.     But now,  Gentlemen, whichever view you take upon the broad principles of this question, I would suggest to you that the wise course for us here today is not so much to argue about principles but to analyse the kind of precautions that we have in mind, and I believe that at the end of the analysis we shall find that in actual practice it is impossible to take up either of the extreme viewB, namely, that the expenditure should be wholly national or that the expenditure should be wholly local.       Then-4-
I think it will he found, if we &quot;break up the problem into its constituent parts,  that at any rate in certain of them,  in certain of the activities covered by them,  the activities are essentially or to a great extent local;    it will be found in others of them that the main responsibilities are probably national,  and I suggest to you that to-day, as the beginning of our discussions, I might give you a broad picture shewing the kind of services that we envisage, pointing out to you what we are doing or what we suggest doing, and then asking for your views, not only upon the points I am raising this afternoon but upon what is the best procedure for carrying on our further discussions.Now, Gentlemen,  if I begin my survey with a very brief description of what we are actually doing now, what the State is actually doing,  and what in certain branches of those activities the State proposes to continue to do, I think that would be the best course, but let me begin my survey by emphasizing a point that I do not think has received the full attention which is due to it,  namely,  that you will find when we proceed further with these discussions that the main expenditure involved is capital expenditure and not maintenance expenditure.      If I gave you a rough figure I would say that upon the kind of scale we contemplate the recurrent annual expenditure over the whole country,  that is to say England, Scotland and Wales, will be something in the nature of a million a year.      I say that at the outset lest you should think that the recurrent expenditure was going into the very large figures that we have seen often connected with the question of air raid precautions generally.Now,  let me begin my survey with drawing your attention to the fact that we here, at the Home Office, have already set up a central organisation for which we are finding the whole cost, and that we are intending,  in the immediate future, greatly to strengthen this organisation and to make it
more fully capable of dealing with these many complex duties. Secondly, we are already accumulating a great stock of respirators, both for those who will be engaged on air raid precaution services and for the general population.     We have made great progress with this programme,  and I can tell you that it looks as if we shall have it completed by the end of the year, that is to say that by the end of the year we shall have in store something like thirty million respirators, and it is interesting to note in this connection that both in Germany and in France, where preparations are already being made for a stock of respirators,  the local bodies are being called upon for a certain share of the expenditure, and in some cases the private individuals are being expected to buy their respirators. Now here we are providing these thirty million respirators entirely at the national cost.Thirdly, we are accumulating,  also at the national cost,  large stocks of bleaching powder for decontamination of places and things which may be affected by gas.     The Government have undertaken the whole of the executive and financial responsibility for this, and I may say in passing, as a matter of interest,  that we are finding, as a result of research, various methods for keeping this bleaching powder in proper condition a great deal longer than we imagined possible at one time.     Next, the Government have set up,  also at its own cost, an Anti-Gas School for the training of instructors, and we are about to open another.      The contributions which local authorities make in  : respect of their officers who attend these schools is a very small proportion of their cost.     Next,  as regards hospitals,  there is the difficult question of the base hospitals - shall we want any permanent base hospitals or shall we be able to provide the accommodation with existing base hospitals,  of which there are a large number that are now empty, and be able to rely upon emergency.accommodation for the base hospitals?     Well, we have
not formed a final opinion upon the question, hut it looks to me at present as if it is very problematical that we should want new permanent accommodation of this kind for base hospitals. If we did we would acknowledge at once that as these base hospitals would provide accommodation for areas other than one particular area, patients no doubt would have to be taken,  it may be,  substantial distances to the base hospitals, the obligation for the expenditure should to a great extent be national.      The details I would prefer to be discussed not today but at one of our subsequent meetings, but here and now I say that the obligation would have,  in the case of base hospitals that have to be specially built,  to be largely national.Now, we have not reached a stage where final figures can be given, but on a rough estimate it can be said that the capital expenditure involved in the commitments that I have just described to you represents something of the order of forty per cent, of the total capital expenditure which we envisage as necessary.      In this forty per cent, figure,  let me repeat, we are shouldering the whole responsibility, we are finding the whole expenditure.There remains a field of expenditure, partly capital and partly recurring, where the apportionment of expenditure has not yet been finally settled,  falling under the following main heads:    Recurrent expenditure on staff and office accommodation for air raid precaution purposes;    secondly, expenditure on the provision of first-aid posts and depots for first aid and rescue parties and decontamination squads, and of laundries for the decontamination of clothing;    next, the provision of special equipment and stores for the various air raid precaution services;    and lastly, and very importantly, the cost of fire fighting appliances and equipment, together with the recurrent cost of maintenance and the training of auxiliary firemen.     As I said just now the heaviest item is capital expenditure.

As I said just now the heaviest item is capital expenditure.
As regards the recurring cost of staff, maintenance, etc., precise figures cannot yet be given.     We do not envisage an expenditure spread over the whole country much in excess of a million a year, and it may very well prove to be less.      Now, Gentlemen,  as regards this field of expenditure,  the Government are also prepared to accept a substantial responsibility,  that is to say the second field of expenditure with which I am dealing, but they do not think that it would be fair on the taxpayer or wise in the interests of the scheme to accept the whole of the financial burden.      There must be a number of details to be adjusted, but the broad principle which I wish to put to you today is that this expenditure, this second field of expenditure, should be equally shared bysthe Government and the local authorities.To sum up, what we propose is that over the large field which I have mentioned the Government should accept full financial responsibility,  and that the remainder should be shared.     When we come to consider this service by service,  I do not exclude the possibility that some particular..items -I mention fire brigades as an example - may present special features which call for special treatment, but this perhaps is not the occasion for attempting to apply principles in detail. In brief, however, it will be seen - and this is important -that the effect of our proposals over the whole field of expenditure is roughly that it should be divided between the Government and the local authorities in the proportion of 70 to 30.     There are, of course, many other details to be worked out, such as the machinery for the payment of the government contribution, the date from which it should operate, and so on, but I hope we may today arrive at some agreement on principle by which we can at any rate get a basis for discussion with a view to working out the administrative details by subsequent meetings.There are, I think, only two other general questions
to which I need refer at this stage.      One of these questions is concerned with the scale of expenditure on air raid precaution services for which local authorities are responsible.     Had it been possible to do so I  should have been glad to give you precise estimates of the expenditure to be incurred on each of these services, but,  in fact, .no single estimate can be attempted; the schemes must vary according to the risk.      All that can be said at the present time is that the total amount involved in the various schemes taken as a whole might be of the order of  10 million to  15 million exclusive of expenditure on services wholly chargeable to the Exchequer.      The other question is whether legislation is necessary.      I am,  of course, aware of the doubt that is felt in some quarters as to the power of local authorities to involve themselves in expenditure on air raid precautions.      It may not, however,  &quot;be necessary to discuss this point, as, apart from any doubts that, may exist, the Government is of opinion that there should be a specific statutory basis for air raid precaution expenditure , and legislation defining the powers and duties of the Central Government and of local authorities in this matter will be introduced as soon as possible.I trust that after due consideration the local authorities concerned in this matter will be willing to reach a settlement on the basis of the offer that I have made, and that, with the assurance of so large a measure of support from the Exchequer and the Government&apos;s determination to introduce legislation on the subject,  they will be prepared,  in co-operation with the Central Government,  to discharge to the utmost their responsibilities for the protection,of their citizens against the dangers which we all hope may never be encountered of attack from the air.There, Gentlemen, I have tried, in as short a space as I could,  to give you the general picture as I see it.     I shall
9 9very much welcome your comments, and when you have made them I should very much like to have your suggestions as to future prodecure.     Let me say - and this is now my last word - I am most anxious that together we should work out an effective scheme to meet a. very real and urgent danger, and that we should hold the balance fairly&apos; between the taxpayer and the ratepayer,MR. MORRISON.    Does the Secretary of State for Scotland wish to say anything before I reply?SECRETARY OP STATE FOR SCOTLAND.      No,  I have no remarks to make at this stage.MR. MORRISON;    Sir Samuel and Mr.  Elliot, first of all, on behalf of all the representatives of local authorities present, I should like to say that we are obliged to you and the Secretary of State for Scotland for receiving us and for giving us such full information this afternoon.      I will not say complete, because you yourselves would agree that there are a good many blanks about it, but nevertheless you have taken us into your confidence to a very great extent and that we appreciate.      May I say, Sir Samuel, that I think every one of us representing the local authorities of England, Wales and Scotland, would at once agree that you, as Home Secretary, and your colleague, the Secretary of State for Scotland, are charged with an invidious responsibility of a difficult and complicated nature, and that not one of us, I think, would envy either of you   -your job in this particular respect.      It is a difficult task, it is a complicated task, but nevertheless that is what Ministers are for, and they have to take the complicated tasks with the simple tasks as they oome along, but everyone of us will sympathise with you in the difficulty of the problem that faces you and the very great responsibilities -ties that  fall upon the two Ministers primarily concerned.
Secondly, I should like you to accept our assurance that none of us, whatever our private opinions may he, are actuated in this matter by any sort of political or party considerations We are here meeting the representatives of two State Departments? . we are local authorities and it is our duty that our official relationships should not be influenced by these considerations in the least, and, in fact, as you will know, some of us, perhaps myself in particular, among our own political friends had some considerable difficulties at the beginning of this business when Sir John Simon made the announcement originally in saying straightaway that it was the duty of local authorities to co-operate with the State, There were some of our friends who thought we had gone all wrong, and that we ought not to have done any such thing, but we followed what we considered to be the course of public duty, that it was the duty of local authorities to co-operate in this matter, and therefore if, as I am afraid is going to be the state of all of us, we come to a conclusion on the finance of air raid precautions which is different from yours, I hope you will accept my assurance, which is given on behalf of everybody present, on behalf of all the local authority Associations, which include people of every kind of opinion, that we do not do so from any personal or political motives,&quot; but that we are concerned with what is right in this matter of financing of air raid precautions,,Now, Sir, we have given the matter very careful consideration in anticipation of this interview this afternoon. \/e had a meeting in London some little time ago, as the result of which a joint letter from all the. local authority Associations of England and Wales and the London County Council was addressed to your predecessor, and since then our Scottish colleagues have been communicated with by you, and
they are with us in this deputation this afternoon.      They have been present at our preliminary meeting and they them-selves independently have come to the same conclusion to which we have come.     My colleagues have asked me to put before you and the Secretary of State for Scotland the unanimous opinions of the deputation which is before you this afternoon, opinions which are uttered not on their own responsibility but after very careful consideration by the Association of Municipal Corporations, the County Councils Association, the Urban and Rural District Councils Association, the Metropolitan Borough Standing Joint Committee, the London County Council, and the three important local authority Associations from Scotland who are with us this afternoon. This is the view that we take.    in our judgment Air Raid Precautions, whilst not in itself a military operation -it is a question very largely of succouring the civil popula-tion and preparing for that in view of the possibility of military attack from another country - but although it is not of itself a military operation in our view it is intimately, directly and inextricably related to the whole question of national defence.      It therefore ought to be considered as to whether it is not within the same category of financial responsibility as the organisation and direction of the Army, the Navy and the Air Forces themselves.     Air attack, if it comes, and with you we all hope it will not, it comes as a o result of international difficulties arising out of difficulties between our own Government and other Governments in the realm of foreign policy.      It is a national event that the State must tackle when the event occurs and deal with it as a national question, and we shall all, I imagine, be, in a greater or lesser degree, subject to the orders of the State. It therefore seems to us that Air Raid Precautions essentially are a national matter related to national defence, arising
/ out of considerations and events of national and internationalpolicy.      It is a field within which local authorities have no function, no power, and indeed are not competent, as local authorities, to express an opinion either on the field of foreign policy or military, naval or aerial policy itself.     Air Raid Precautions must he related to the general character of defence, the possibilities of defence, or repelling an aerial enemy, and is at all points interlocked directly --..and indirectly, and related to the question of national defence, and therefore to the function of the State.      There is, as you have told us, a good deal of disagreement as to whether we are capable of effective defence against aerial attack, or whether, as Mr. Baldwin said, the bomber will get through.      About that, Sir,  we cannot argue, we are not going to argue, we are only local authority administrators, we have no knowledge of that business, and as local authority administrators we have no officers competent to advise us.      That is the business of the State.      The whole of this business seems to us to be intimately related to the State functions, and if it were practicable for the State to discharge all the duties relating to Air Raid Precautions themselves directly, if it were administratively practicable for that to be done, everyone of us would say, although we are often trying to claim powers at the expense of the State, and to get greater powers, everyone of us, I think, would say it is proper that the State should have that responsibility and that function, and the local authorities ought not to have ambitions to discharge them.      But if, in fact, the State comes to the conclusion, and I think understandably and reasonably, that it must for certain aspects of Air Raid Precautions use the
machinery and the organisation of the local authorities,and our answer upon that point is that it is our duty, as responsible local administrators, to co-operate with theState to give them all the help and co-operation that theState may require in accordance with the knowledge of theState, which the State alone has, and for which the state must take responsibility;    we are prepared to give theState every proper form of co-operation for which theState may ask.     But whilst we are prepared to act as agents for the State, whilst we are prepared to co-operate withthe State, we cannot accept financial responsibility, wereally cannot, Sir, and it is no good my offering negotiations,because at the moment I cannot see what there is tonegotiate about unless this question of principle issettled-      It seems to us that the state, having bigresponsibilities for the Navy, Army and Air Force, havingraised very large funds, including a very big loan forthat purpose, the State really ought not to boggle -   andI am very, very serious about this - the state reallyought not to boggle at the relatively limited expenditurein relation to Air Raid Precautions, and we earnestly express the view, and I am desired and directed to intimate to you that we must retain the point of view that it is the dutyof the State to bear the whole financial responsibilityfor this;    that is to say, we will provide what isnecessary for the normal civil requirements of local government,but beyond that we must ask that the State should hear theresponsibility financially for all shnormal requirementsover the ordinary requirements of local government.
I admit, having said that - and I say it after consultation with my colleagues - that if the State pays the 100 per cento  the State must have the right of direction, it must call the tune, it must decide what is to he done, and we cannot as local authorities argue as to whether your proposals are adequate or inadequate.      That is a proper responsibility of Ministers and we would have to be content .to be in the position to act as agents of the State and not freely functioning local authorities functioning in the ordinary way.      Sir Samuel, I would like to add this.      If there is to be a State grant varying in character according to the service,  in some cases being possibly 100 per cent, and in others on the average 50 per cent, more or less according to the nature of the service, presumably, or a flat rate grant, I do suggest to you, Sir, that the operations of the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland are going to be very difficult operations.     You will come to local authorities and say that you think this and that and the other ought to be done,  this, that and the other expenditure ought to be incurred.     Local authorities will have to consider their share of1- the expenditure, they will argue and they will argue at very great length, I am afraid, as to whether that expenditure ought or ought not to be incurred, and I venture to say, Sir, from the point of view of the effective discharge of this 30b, and the delay has already been very considerable, it is profoundly important that this possibility of really material delay ought not to be contemplated by Ministers charged with this unwelcome but important duty.     Moreover, the local authorities are faced with a great deal of embarrassment.      Prices for materials, for supplies for

Looal authorities will have to consider their share of&apos;, the expenditure, they will argue and they will argue at very great length, I am afraid, as to whether that expenditure ought or ought not to be incurred, and I venture to say, Sir, from the point of view of the effective discharge of this job, and the delay has already been very considerable, it is profoundly important that this possibility of really material delay ought not to be contemplated by Ministers charged with this unwelcome but important duty.     Moreover, the looal authorities are faced with a great deal of embarrassment.      Prices for materials, for supplies for
local authorities are going up substantially.      Contractors are getting more and more stiff as to the terms upon which they will tender for local authorities.      Our financial problems are inevitably increasing now that legislation has come which has increased municipal expenditure.     May I suggest that from the point of view of the goodwill of this business - and whilst I do not wish to say a word about the particular difficulties of particular local authorities, some of them will be in greater difficulties than others in these respects - it will be a thousand pities if the issue crops up in local elections, if the issue crops up in the municipal Debating Chamber as to whether because of the expenditure which the local authority is bearing in respect of Air Raid Precautions the local authority has got to consider some sort of restriction upon its social services and expenditure in connection therewith.      Even authorities of my particular colour,  that are not always quite as &quot;axe-y&quot;  in their handling of municipal expenditure as othersf nevertheless have got to consider their total budget. We have to consider it, we all know that there is some limit - I am not quite sure where it is - beyond which the ratepayer will kick, and we are always watching for it and it may well be the case that many local authorities, might get to the point that a very important and popular piece of work might not be done, we might have to say, &quot;we are sorry that in relation to the total expenditure of the Council we cannot do it&quot;.      Then the issue comes up that that work is being stopped because Air Raid Precautions are a charge upon the local authority instead of upon the State; and, if that happens every Council will come into the whole controversial business, which many of us successfully have
been able to avoid and which I am anxious to avoid because we want to do our duty whatever views we may have about foreign policy, military policy, and so on, but as soon as that issue arises we shall be in very grave political difficulties and either we shall have to increase the rates or the expenditure on necessary social services may, have to decline, which will be an embarrassment to us.      This matter could quite well become an issue in municipal and county elections throughout the country.      Therefore, Sir Samuel, I have to inform you with every courtesy and with every respect, that I am charged by my colleagues to express, with very great firmness, at their unanimous request, that they regret very much that they cannot see their way to recommend municipalities to bear any part of this expenditure, and we hold firmly and decisively to the view that this is eminently a matter upon which the State should not consider making a grant to the local authority but should use its responsibility, and wherever it may be expedient for the State so to do, to use the local authorities for co-operation with the State, but as agents for the State, and we will do whatever is right, we will do what the State considers it our duty to do, but we definitely, firmly and decisively take the view that the responsibility for both policy and expenditure, which is so intimately related to matters of defence, is with the Government and not with local authorities.HOME SECRETARY:    Is any other gentleman going to speak,.Mr. Morrison?MRo MORRISON:    I think not, Sir.
HOME SECRETARY:    Well,  I hope very much that that is not Mr. Morrison&apos;s last word or the last word of the Conference here to-day.      There is the fact that the Government do very definitely take the view that the expenses ought to he shared to some extent.      There is also the fact that in every other country that is at all comparable to ours the expense apparently is shared,  and I should very much have hoped that we could have avoided breaking up on an issue of general principle of that kind, and we could have had at any rate some further talk.      I would have thought myself that Mr. Morrison really when he stated the case,  as he always does extremely well.......MR.  MORRISON:    It is an exceptionally good case, Sir Samuel.HOME SECRETARY:    Well,&quot; it is a good case up to a point.      It is a good case to say that the State ought to bear a very large share of the expenditure and I have already said we are ready to do that, but is there not also a case on the other side, namely that several of these services are really local authority services,  the obligation is upon the local authority with several of them.      With several of them is there not also a consideration to be kept in mind that if the State takes over these particular parts of the local services,  say, for instance^  the Fire Brigade or some part of the lighting or the cleaning   services,  I would have thought it did strike a considerable blow at the responsibilities of local authorities.MR.  MORRISON:    May I say that we are not in any way asking the Government - it would be wrong as a by-product of this discussion,   it would be quite wrong for us to ask the State to take over any of our difficulties.      We
.D iare all content,  subject to our right to get money out of the Treasury in the ordinary way, which we are not too optimistic about,  to go on in that respect with things as they are, but it is a question of asking us to take on added responsibilities in relation to an essentially national function and with great respect we cannot accept that view.      There is,  of course,  at least one service - I do not know whether there are more - where counties and county boroughs do act as the agents of the Minister, where the Minister meets the whole charge, namely the administration of Road Fund Licences.HOME SECRETARY:    I would have thought a number of these services were really extensions of existing local authorities&apos;  services.MR. MORRISON:    I accept that.HOME SECRETARY:    The Police,  Pire Brigade,  and so on, whatever the service is,  for which to some extent at any rate you were responsible in the last war.      Take v/hat happens in the case of a naval bombardment of a seaside town, there I would certainly have thought that the local authority or whatever the authority was had certain responsibilities to fulfil.MR. MORRISON:    That may be what will happen if and when war actually occurs,  I am sure that will get settled at the time, but we cannot have deputations about it, I imagine we shall be too busy looking after something else, but we are not now dealing with a situation in which war exists;    it is a question of preparation for the situation of war,  and therefore the analogy of the war,  1914 to -1918, with great respect, does not enter into it.     This is preparation for a war situation, and that Is why we hold so strongly that it is essentially a national function.
SECRETARY OP STATE FOR SCOTLAND:-  I am a little alarmed with that contention.      It does seem to me that the&apos; suggestion that&apos; the expenditure should he entirely borne by the State while no doubt very sound from the Metropolitan angle,  is not so sound for the more distant parts of the country.      I am thinking more particularly of my own district, and I look with a great deal of apprehension at the position in which the whole responsibility,  let me say,  for the fire engines, was in the hands of the Government.MR. MORRISON: My Scottish colleagues will no doubt deal better with the proposition of the Secretary of State for Scotland than I can, but in point of fact it is not suggested that the Government should take over the whole responsibility for the Pire Brigade, but that the Government should accept responsibility for the extension of the Pire Brigade for this purpose in relation to Air Raid Precautions.SECRETARY OP STATE FOR SCOTLAND:    Do we not come inevitably to your point as to how inextricably all these things are bound up,  and if all the spare equipment was entirely paid for by the Government I can well conceive a situation in which the Government ordered away all the fire engines to London,  to the intense indignation of everybody in my part of the world, but if the Government paid for the whole of the Fire engines they would undoubtedly call the tune in that respect.MR. DOLLAN: We should not send the fire engines. That is a point that does not concern you at all what we do with them at the present time.SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND:    No,   it is not exactly that.      The suggestion is that an extra amount of equipment is necessary to.deal with an extra risk.      The suggestion of the Government is that a proportion of the payment for that extra equipment should be found by the local
0 oauthority,  and therefore a certain amount of the control would pass to the local authority.      The suggestion that Mr. Morrison puts out is that no part of the cost and no part of the control of that equipment should remain with the local authorities. Now,  quite apart from the inextricable character of it, because I do not think it would be very easy to separate out that portion of the Fire Brigade which was under the Council&apos;s orders or that part of the equipment which was under the Government&apos;s orders, without greatly damaging the efficiency of the Fire Brigade,  I do see a position in which all the fire engines of Scotland were sent down to London and we in Scotland were left in the air,  and from my point of view it does seem to me a somewhat dangerous line of argument.MR.  DOLLAN:    You know our position in Scotland and we have had a consideration of the whole thing.      The Fire Brigade question does not bother us very much in relation to this cost at all.HOME SECRETARY:    Are you quite right there?MR. DOLLAN: It is all right for you to shake your head, Mr. Elliot. I am the local administrator and I know what I am talking about.SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND: &apos;&quot;I was not shaking my head at all, I was merely taking it as one of the examples of a situation that might arise.MR.  DOLLAN:    You take a large area.      What happens is that the Fire Brigade is under the local authority and itsrules are in force at the present time and in the City ofthat , butGlasgow you can take/into account in the present services,/ what we are concerned about is the additional services. Take the Medical services.      On these Medical services we mustspend  50,000, but we are prepared to put the whole organisation of the Public Health Department at your disposal, but we say that the cost of all these extra supplies must be borne by you,  and you probably know that we have gone more ahead than any other city in this kingdom, and we have done a very good work with the direct encouragement from the Home Office that you would bear the whole cost.      We have organised exhibitions and we have been told,  &quot;Don&apos;t you worry about the cost, the Government will pay the cost,&quot; and if I go back to Glasgow and tell them what Sir Samuel here has said they will say,  &quot;Let us stand still and we will not do any more&quot;.
SECRETARY OP STATE FOR SCOTLAND:    We are merely saying that we thought we must faoe the situation.    I think myself you will consider that anti-fire devices are an important part of the risk which we have to encounter.   I do not want to put it too high, but I think Mr. Morrison would agree with me, and I am looking at this merely from my own point of view as a Scottish Administrator,    If the whole responsibility and the whole control over this Is given to the Government I feel very much that the orders of the Government may take little account of what I may call the more distant parts of the country,  (and I am taking Scotland as merely an example,) and things will inevitably tend to be concentrated in the Metropolis.   We have seen it happen before.Mr. MORRISON:    This is merely a shameful attempt to set some of us against others.SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND:    You must remember the rest of us are always a little jealous of the capital.MR. MORRISON:   You would not believe how jealous I am of Scotland,SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND:    That may well be, but I think our jealousies are better founded than yours, but however that may be I only threw that out as an example.   Take it the other way round.   It may-well be that a milder Secretary of State at the Home Office than Sir Samuel might persuade the Government to send all the London fire engines to Scotland. Then I can imagine the state of the London County Council at being denuded of its engines.MR, DOLLAN:    We should not want them.    We have efficient egines.
9tCSECRETARY OP STATE FOR SCOTLAND;    They would all be efficient under these conditions, Mr. Dollan.    There are border-line cases in which the authorities have a lively desire to preserve a certain amount of control as compared with other places where they desire that the whole control should be taken over by the State,ALDERMAN RAYNES:    Mr. Chairman, you would want area officers who would operate as special organisers apart from the local authorities, under the control of the Government.    It would be different from the local authorities.   There would be special Air Raid Officers for each area, Glasgow, London, and so on, under the Government control,SECRETARY OF  STATE FOR SCOTLAND:    I do not think that has been fully worked out,HOME SECRETARY:    I have the feeling strongly in my own mind that the schemes or the administration of the schemes will be better if there is a definite interest in them ensured by a local contribution.MR. DOLLAN:    Surely, Sir Samuel, you have been working on this for a year and you know that we have so far the best organisation.    We have opened an office, we have a staff, we have trained 5,000 people, we have decontamination centres, and our chief officials have given their time, administrators have given their time, and wo have done all that on the assumption that you will pay tho cost,HOME SECRETARY s    I do not think we have ever said that,. We have always said from the beginning that the cost should be shared,MR. DOLLAN:   You led us to believe that you would pay, and you have actually asked us to prepare an estimate and we have proceeded on that assumption that you would pay the cost.    I have
no hesitation in stating that this must taring the organisation to a standstill because we have rather pressing financial problems of our own at tho present time.HOME SECRETARY: I was very much hoping that you wouldnot say that.    I was undor the impression that everybody had anyhow accepted the fact that rightly or wrongly the Government took the view that in some cases the cost should be shared.MR, DOLLAN: We have consulted the Scottish Office onthis matter and we said to them, &quot;Will you agree to the appointment of this particular officer that we want?&quot;   We said quite clearly that that was on the understanding that you would pay the cost,SECRETARY OP state?Qi1 SCOTLAND: I think that is not so.We have never accepted that position.    I think Mr. Stewart will bear that out,Mr. STEWART: We have never said that the whole cost will be borne by the Government.    The official circular made that quite clear.MR. DOLLAN:        You have always avoided it by saying you &apos;have not got the real position worked out.HOME SECRETARY: I have got the circular here and Ittalks about assistance to the local authorities,  and the whole Implication of the circular is that the cost shall be shared. This is a circular of two years ago,,MR, DOLLAN:        And I might say we have had-your officers at our committee meetings  and they have told us quite distinctly that the cost would be paid by the Government,MR, ROBERTSON: And when we had a Deputation before yourpredecessor in December last he stated that he would do his best to induce the Chancellor to foot the Bill,SECRETARY OP STATE FOR SCOTLAND: That shows that it certainly was not settled then.   Mr, Dollan is saying that It
has been settled for a long time.HOME SECRETARY:I should be very much surprised too if my predecessor said that.MR, LLOYD:I was there at the time and that is not myimpression at all.MR. MORRISON:On the argument that the Secretary ofState for Scotland has put, Sir Samuel, I am bound to say that this fear that he has got of fire engines which ought to be in Scotland being found in London or vice versa, he is really making the case for proper Government direction and planning in this business.    It would never do to let London have a voice in h.ow many aeroplanes it should have to protect it.   That is properly the decision of the State, and the State will have to decide about fire engines insofar as they are related to preparation for an emergency, and you know, Si&quot;, I cannot follow, honestly, with all the goodwill in the world, what the distinction in principle is that leads you to one conclusion about one thing and to another conclusion about another.   For example, you agree that the State is going to carry the responsibility for respirators, for bleaching powder and for general base hospitals.    Well, I cannot see the difference either In kind or character or degree between those and the other things we have been mentioning.HOME SECRETARY: Well, they are essential services, arethey not, which havas got to be highly synchronised.   With the bleaching powder, there is the question of storage, for instance,MR, DOLLAN: Well, decontamination will actually be doneby local authorities.
HOME SECRETARY: We were assuming that the decontaminationshould be shared, but the bleaching powder and the respirators have got to be kept in certain centres and they have to be of one type.    I think there are peculiar features about them, but the actual decontamination service I should have thought ought certainly to be shared in some way.    After all, It Is one of the local authorities&apos; services.MR. MORRISON:    It may be locally administered.MR. RAYNES:    But not in war time.HOME SECRETARY:    I should have said In war time too.LORD POLWARTH:    We are speaking relatively now.    I am very much afraid that any proposal coming before the County Council will be strongly opposed by sections of our members who will want to devote the money to other purposes, and there will be a great danger of gaps being left in the organisation.    In the rural parts of Scotland, for instance, they will feel they are in very great danger and if they are in the hills they will, feel they might as well stay there, and people from those parts will be very unwilling to bear part of this  expense.    We have already said we are   quite willing to give any help that we possibly can in organising a scheme, but the expense for a great part of it we think ought to be borne by the Central Government.    The Government have taken over our main trunk roads as a national thing, and surely this is every bit as much a national obligation.HOME SECRETARY: I think that Is very much what I wassaying just now, that the greater part of the scheme would be taken over.MR.  RAYNES: The great part would have to be taken over,but why not the whole?HOME SECRETARY: Because I; wish very much, and s o do theGovernment, that these sohemes should be local schemes, and that they would be administered better if there was this division of
responsibility,MR. MORRISON: They could not be local schemes, you could not permit them to be local schemes.LORD POLWARTH: It seems to me it is entirely anational obligation.HOME SECRETARY I should have thought they had got tobe local schemes, that you had got to get the big cities to put up their schemes scheme by scheme, because what may be applicable in one city may not be applicable in another city, there are differences in population and differences in the way the population is scattered and so on.MR. RAYNES: On the point of risk the Association of municipal Authorities felt that certain cities which had factories for munitions or for aircraft vrould be attacked first, and therefore they would have to spend very much larger sums and have very much more elaborate schemes for protection because they would probably be the first to be attacked in an air raid, and therefore we think that this should be a national obligation to spread the burden equally amongst every part of England, Scotland and Wales,   and that no one town or no one area should be singled out or struck off because although they are producing munitions and aircraft they ought not to be penalised by that by paying what Is in fact a large insurance premium for protection.SECRETARY OP STATE FOR SCOTLAND %   &apos;      It is a little hard on the rural counties of Scotland if the money which we Intend to give to thorn should be taken a way and the whole of the burden of protecting some important munitions centre is carried by the country as a whole, including the rural counties of Scotland. It is a little hard for the unhappy places which do not have and will not have a munitions centre to have to pay for the ones which are making the money.
MR. RAYNES: The main proceeds from taxation arise fromthose very big cities, and the rural areas, the very lowly populated areas, would really pay nothing towards protection.SECRETARY CP  STATE FOR SCOTLAND: -       I do not think they would agree to that.MR. RAYNES: There should be payment for the whole nationthrough the taxes.MR. MORRISON: If Mr. Elliot is relating air raidprecautions to munition dumps, if you can find me anything more of a national character than a munition dump I would like to be told.   That is a complete answer to our case.SECRETARY OP STATE FOR SCOTLAND: It was Alderman Rayneswho raised that argument.    I should have thought Glasgow would have required   a certain amount of defence I should not have thought Glasgow was unimportant in Scotland.MR. MORRISON: It is very important.MR. RAYNES: It Is fair to point out that the rural areasin Scotland are not likely to suffer very much any loss of life, but the big industrial centres are going to suffer heavily and in addition they are going to be asked io pay a very large part of the bill which the rural areas need not pay a penny for, and yet those rural areas are going to obtain just as much benefit as any other part of the country.HOME S ECRETARY: They would not obtain anything like thesame protection.    The country would, be graded into zones, and there would be some areas in which the schemes would be schemes involving scarcely any expenditure at all.MR. HOWELL: Well, why should they not pay their fair share through the taxes?MR. RAYNES: In the last war we paid a shilling premiumfor war risks, whether it was on the East Coast or Cornwall or wherever it was.    The risk was not nearly the same, but everybody
paid the premium.Mr. DOLLAN: Would not it be the best course now - itis not much use arguing these side points - to terminate this meeting to give the Government an opportunity of considering these points.HOME SECRETARY: I think we had better..adjourn themeeting, not only for the Government to consider these points but also that we may all consider them.    I am quite ready to adjourn it for that reason, but it ought not to be a unilateral undertaking,MR. DOLLAN: The local authorities have already made up their minds .MR. MORRISON.        I think it would be wrong to mislead you, Sir Samuel, into an idea that the local authorities can re-consider the line they have taken up.    If this had been the first time they had taken up that line, and then they had heard you, it would be perfectly proper that they should go away and re-consider the matter even if they did not alter their point of view, but we did consider It before, and our view was put before your predecessor, and the Association of Municipal Corporations had a deputation to Sir John Simon,    The joint conference we held forwarded its&apos; conclusions.    We have considered it before, and we met this afternoon prior to this meeting and considered it with very great care.   We have heard what you. have said now, and viiilst I do not want to take liberties with the minds of other people I feel practically certain that the attitude of my colleagues will not be modified, but obviously we must adjourn and although we do not take the view that our brains can never function, I think the Government must in the circumstances draw its own line,  and I cannot hold out any prospect on behalf of the deputation that the local authorities will alter thoir views.
HOME SECRETARY:    I agree to this extent,  that I think there is no useful purpose served in dealing with questions of detail at this time,  and I think the best thing is that we adjourn without prejudice on both sides.MR.  MORRISON:    Without question put.HOME SECRETARY: Without question put, but I have at the back of my mind still a hope that although I may not have put the case very well.....MR.  MORRISON:    Oh,  you put it very well,  Sir.HOME SECRETARY:    ....the representatives here will think once again about what seems to me rather a mistaken attitude that they have taken up.      Anyhow,  I can say this, I am glad we have had this meeting,  which may have cleared the air.      We have met each other and I still hope that we shall meet again,  and I still hope that we shall come to some agreement.MR.  DOLLAN:    I presume that those local authorities, such as my own, Glasgow, which have incurred a considerable amount of expenditure, will suspend their operations, because I for one am not going to recommend the local authority to go on spending/money.HOME spQP^ETARY:&apos;-: I should have thought that there again we might adjourn without prejudice and that no extreme aq^ion would be taken to prematurely*MR. DOLLAN: Well, I feel personally that we have been rather led astray,  Sir.HOME SECRETARY: You would not expect me to agree with that view.I would now suggest that so far as to-day&apos;s meeting is concerned we had better issue an agreed communique, had we not?MR,. MORRISON:    I think so,  it can be settled by our officers.
HOME SECRETARY:    With one or two of your people    &quot;d and my people.MR.  MORRISON:    Yes.      There is one other thing, whether,  as you have got a note of the proceedings, you would he disposed to let us have for our own information a copy of that note.      I do not know how you will feel about that.HOME SECRETARY:    I should think it would be a good thing.MR. LLOYD:    Bearing in mind,  of course, that it is confidential.HOME SECRETARY:    Yes.      Then apart from the communique that we shall issue, we will regard the proceedings of to-day as confidential.MR.  MORRISON:    Yes.HOME SECRETARY:    But I undertake to circulate a shorthand copy of the report of the proceedings also for the information of ourselves.MR. MORRISON:   To each of the Associations?HOME SECRETARY:    Yes, to each of the Associations, to be treated as confidential.MR.  MORRISON:    And,  finally, would you mind,  as we have to consider how we are to communicate with our own local authorities, how we are to report,  if we had a further meeting here at the rising of this conference.HOME SECRETARY:    No, you must suit your own convenience about that, Mr. Morrison.MR.  MORRISON:.  Thank you.HOME SECRETARY:   I still hope we may have another meeting and that we may find ourselves in greater agreement than we are to-day.
MR. MORRISON:    Well,  Sir,  if you ask us to come again we should not he so discourteous as to refuse, hut I do not want to mislead you into thinking that our position will alter.      Honestly,  I do not think it can.(The Proceedings terminated).
