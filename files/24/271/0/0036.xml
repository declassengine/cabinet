THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1937.SECRET. Copy No.   44CP. 236 (37).CABINET.RELATIONS WITH THE IRISH FREE STATE.Memorandum, by the. Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I CIRCULATE an account of my conversation with Mr. de Valera in London regarding the financial dispute with the Irish Free State, to which I referred in the memorandum CP. 228 (37) circulated to the Cabinet last week.M. M.October 12, 1937.In the course of my conversation with Mr. de Valera at the Grosvenor Hotel on the 4th October I told him that I had not yet had an opportunity of discussing with my colleagues the substance of our talks in Geneva. I was preparing a report for their consideration, but I had given considerable thought to the matter myself, and would like to tell him quite frankly some of my own personal views regarding the possibility of a general settlement of outstanding matters between our two Governments. I would naturally like to see agreements with the Irish Free State on the financial and trade disputes and on questions of defence. If we could get those three agreements, it would be an excellent thing for both countries. It would be good from his point of view, since it would remove a number of his difficulties, and it would be good from our point of view. I under-stood from what he had said to me that agreements on those subjects alone would not produce a feeling of whole-hearted and unqualified friendship in the Free State towards Great Britain. He had made it plain that whilst-partition lasted that sentiment could not exist. I could see no prospect of partition being even modified. Nevertheless, he had said that a settlement of these other matters would bring some improvement in feeling, and I thought it was obvious that both peoples would reap advantages.I had therefore been trying to estimate the possibilities of a general settle-ment of those questions, and had come to the conclusion that it was not completely impossible. There were two or three major difficulties. I could not say what view my colleagues and I would take when we examined the prospects closely. I was only speaking to him tentatively, and did not wish to be officially committed by anything that I said. I hoped that perhaps we might both &quot; think aloud,&quot; not speaking as President of the Irish Free State Executive Council or Secretary of State.Mr. de Valera remarked that he would very much like a talk on that basis.I said that a general settlement would be quite impossible unless he would go considerably further to meet us on the financial dispute than he had yet shown any inclination to do. If he could meet us on that, it was possible that the two Governments could find ways of reaching a settlement on the other matters. I would like to put an idea into his head regarding a financial settlement: As I understood his position, it was as follows. He said that it was out of the question for him to pay a penny of the Land Annuities monies. That meant that he proposed that we should write off some  78,000,000 which we believed were due to us.Mr. de Valera interrupted to say that  78,000,000 stated in that bald way sounded a tremendous sum of money.  But it had to be set off against the much [15969] B
larger sums which he believed would be owing by us to the Irish Free State if there was a fair consideration of the claims that they could justly put forward. For instance, in his view the Irish had been over-taxed ever since the beginning of the last century. There were many other claims which would mount up to a sum far in excess of  78,000,000.I replied that I was familiar with his case covering the whole of the last century, and that we could answer that case with innumerable arguments. If he was really going seriously to put that case forward, we should go. on arguing without stopping for a week and get nowhere in the end. I knew that he was interested in getting a practical agreement, and hoped that we could avoid putting up arguments which were bound to be rejected by the other side.He agreed.I repeated that I understood that he thought it was impossible for him to pay any of the Land Annuities. On the other hand, he had told me in Geneva that Royal Irish Constabulary pensions, local loans payments and the other items in the Financial Agreements which we had made with the Cosgrave Government were open for discussion. It was true that he had not said that he would be ready to pay these monies, but he had not dismissed the possibility of doing so.Mr. de Valera interrupted again to confirm that this was the position, but to add that he knew there were arguments on the Irish side against paying these monies. He would have to consult his advisers. It was possible that on consideration he would think that the balance of argument was in favour of the payments being made. But even if the argument went that way he thought that we should not press his Government for payment. In his view all the money which we had received during recent years on account of Land Annuities had been unjustly received, and if this sum were balanced against whatever the Irish Free State might owe us on account of those other items, we should still be in pocket.I replied that I could understand there were arguments from the Irish side why these other payments should not be made. There was an argument for any case. On our side we could produce counter-arguments. I could only say frankly that if he dismissed the possibility of making payments on account of these items, irrespective of his views about Land Annuities, then the prospect of a new financial agreement, followed by other agreements, would disappear altogether. Moreover, payments of these items alone would not be sufficient. They amounted to a fairly small fraction of the monies which in our view were due to us. I would like to complete the suggestion which I hoped that he would consider. He had introduced the possibility. of his Government spending considerable sums on an expanded defence programme; indeed, his own proposal was that all payments by the Irish Free State under the existing Financial Agreement should come to an end, and that the sole substitute for them should be this defence expenditure. But even if he were to say that he was ready to embark on this defence expenditure in addition to making payments on account of R.I.C. pensions, the local loans and the other items (excluding Land Annuities) which we had discussed, that did not seem to me to make a basis on which we could negotiate. The fact was that unless he would be willing to make some extra payment, in substitution for the Land Annuities, I did not believe agreement was possible.The idea that I would like, quite unofficially and non-committally, to put in his mind was therefore that the two Governments should negotiate a new Financial Agreement. The old Agreements would be wiped out. We would start afresh, and the make-up of the new agreement would be as follows. The Irish Free State Government should1 be relieved of Land Annuities payments, but would agree to pay the sums which they had been paying annually until he came into office on account of R.I.C. pensions, local loans and other items. In addition, they would spend considerable sums on defence, and in further addition they would agree to make a new payment perhaps on account of some old claim which we had dropped at the time of the previous Agreements, but which we would revive. Perhaps that new payment would not amount to the full value of the old Land Annuities, but it would have to be a very considerable sum. I emphasised that this was a purely personal suggestion, and said that I did not expect that he would wish to answer the suggestion that evening, but hoped that he would keep it in his mind and not reject it. If he did reject it, then we were as far away from a settlement as ever.
Mr, de Valera said that he quite understood that our conversation committed no-one; indeed he would not even make a record of it. But he was afraid I was asking too much. In any case he did not believe that Financial Agreements which resulted in one country making annual payments to another were wise agreements. They always led to trouble, as they had done in the case of pur War Debt agreements with the Allies and the United States of America. The Cosgrave Financial Agreements with us had led to similar trouble. If the Government in Dublin had to make a payment to London every year, the money had to be voted annually by the Dail. There was liable to be a debate on each occasion, producing constant friction between the two Govern-ments. That kind of situation made friendship difficult. He was anxious for real friendship and co-operation between our two countries, and because of that he was opposed to the kind of financial settlement which I had out-lined. On the other hand, he could see&apos; that we could not consent to the complete wiping out, without any substitute, of the old Financial Agreements. Therefore he had considered carefully whether there was any way in which the Irish Free State could pay some substitute which would not involve annual payments from one Government to the other. That was one reason why he arrived at his proposal that the Irish Free State should spend considerably increased amounts on defence.I answered that the expenditure on defence itself would be small.He said that he could not understand that argument at all. The expenditure would be very considerable, and a very heavy burden for a comparatively small population. It was true that if we considered only the capital expenditure involved in his defence plans the sum was small. But we must count in main-tenance costs over an indefinite number of years. Those costs would be high. For example, he would wish to increase the size of his army, and in addition would enlarge his volunteer organisation. He would probably double his expenditure on the army. He did not carry the figures in his head, but he thought that he would probably have to spend  1,000,000 a year extra on that item alone.I said that I could not understand why this extra cost of his army, or the additional expenditure which he envisaged on some other defence items, should enter into the discussions of a new financial agreement between us. There were certain defence costs which might properly come into such a discussion. For instance, to-day the United Kingdom forces were occupying some Irish ports; we were responsible for keeping the defence of those ports in a state of efficiency; the money for those things was at present paid out of our Treasury. I believed that to some extent the same applied to the coast defence of the Irish Free State. If as a part of a general settlement our occupation of the ports ceased and we were therefore relieved of that particular expenditure, and his Government undertook that expense in our place, then I could understand those costs being considered as an item in a new financial bargain between us. But we were not responsible for the Irish Free State army to-day; we were not spending any money on it. However much the Irish Free State Government might decide to spend on it, that would not relieve us of any of our present burdens. It was something altogether outside our discussion of a readjustment of the financial burdens between us. Therefore we could not throw any of those costs into the balance in his favour.He replied that he quite understood that our people would use that argument. But it was not really quite sound. If the Union had not come to an end and the Irish Free State had still therefore been a part of the United Kingdom, we should have been responsible for the defence of the whole of Ireland and should have had to spend to-day enormous sums on the defence of the ports, on air bases, the army, &amp;c. The Irish Free State was saving us the expenditure which would otherwise fall on us. Moreover, it was really a matter of the vital importance to us that this expenditure should be incurred. We could not afford to have a weak Ireland on our flank, which might be a base for an enemy attack on us. An expanded defence programme in the Irish Free State would add to our security; it was indeed an essential element in our security, and we would benefit almost as much from it as would the people of the Free State. Many people in Ireland would say that we would benefit more from it, and that an Irish defence programme would really primarily be a programme for the defence of Great Britain.   But although that sort of argument would carry great weight with[15969] b 2
many in the Free State and lead to some strong opposition to his proposals for -defence expenditure, he thought that he could raise national enthusiasm for the plan, if he could advocate it free from other difficulties.I replied that it was unfair to argue as though it were a responsibility of ours to see that the Irish Free State had increased defence forces. Usually the Irish were anxious to proclaim their national freedom and &apos;&apos; independence &apos;&apos; of us. Now suddenly they sought to avoid the responsibilities attached to their freedom. Naturally we should Avelcome any increase in their defence programme; it would certainly be of assistance to us, just as our re-armament programme must be of enormous assistance to them in increasing their security. But if they increased their defence, they would only be doing what every other state in the world was doing. The world situation was forcing practically every country to re-arm for the defence of its own people.Mr. de Valera said that their armaments in the Free State would have to he much stronger on account of their neighbourhood to us than they need be if we were not their neighbours.. They would then be a small nation whom no one would wish to attack.   &apos;I replied that they were only sharing the fate of many small nations. Belgium, Holland, Switzerland and others were all increasing their armament votes, whether they were neighbours of ours or not. As for the Free State&apos;s neighbourhood to us, they could not blame us for that. We were not responsible for putting Ireland where it was. I knew that he would not misunderstand me if I said that if we had our choice we would put it in some very different situation.He laughed and said that we would probably be able to agree about that.I said that if he really meant that he could only pay for his defence programme, and that he could not make any agreement which included also the other items which I had mentioned, then no settlement was possible. That meant that the tariff against Irish Free State imports would continue; there could be no trade agreement; a defence agreement also became impossible. The only chance of our getting all those agreements was that he should come much further to meet us on finance. I was merely stating to him quite frankly a fact which he and I had to face.He replied that in that case he was afraid no agreement was possible. He felt strongly that a financial agreement which meant that payments must continue to be made from the Irish Free State Government to the United Kingdom Govern-ment would be a great mistake, for the reasons which he had already stated. In 1920 he had already held strongly that an agreement of that nature between Ireland and Great Britain would lead to continual trouble. Nevertheless, he had realised then that if the Union was to come to an end and Ireland to become a fully self-governing nation, there would have to be some financial agreement between our two countries. At that time he had wondered whether, in order to avoid the difficulty which he had just mentioned, it would be possible to reach an agreement by which the Irish Government would become responsible for various payments owing to their own people in Ireland, such as pensions to their Ex-Servicemen, whilst we were responsible for the rest. By that means annual votes in the Dail for monies to be paid to the United Kingdom could be avoided. Another possibility which he had then considered was that of a lump sum payment. To make such a payment they would have to make a great effort in Ireland; they would have to raise a loan; but he thought the effort would be worth making. Some of his friends had criticised this plan. They said that it would be stupid to pay all at once a large capital sum to the United Kingdom, because if the payment was spread over a number of years there was always a chance that relations between the two countries would so improve that the United Kingdom would let Ireland off the later payments. But he himself had at that time been inclined to favour the idea of a lump sum payment. However, the whole situation had altered since. For many years we had received Land Annuity and other pay-ments, of which he thought at least the Land Annuity payments had been thoroughly unjustified. We had received a lot that was not owing to us. There-fore he thought the matter should be regarded as settled, if the Irish Free State undertook to tspend certain sums on defence.I repeated that if he and his colleagues were not going to move from that line of argument, then the possibility of negotiations between us would disappear. I was only stating a fact when I said that those arguments were unacceptable to
us. Nevertheless, I could appreciate the force of what he said about avoiding, if possible, an agreement which meant annual payments from the Irish Free State Government to the United Kingdom Government. Indeed, when I had first begun to think about this problem I too wondered whether the dispute might not be settled by a lump sum payment to us. But I had dismissed the idea as not fully avoiding what he wanted to avoid. The sum would have to be a very considerable one; it could only be paid out of the proceeds of a loan which the Free State Government would have to raise, and which it might not be able to raise internally. Interest payments on the loan would be a burden on the Irish Free State Exchequer for a generation or more, and very likely some of the payments would have to be made outside the Irish Free State. It had seemed to me that his Government might be as reluctant to assume that form of annual payment as they apparently were to assume the form of payments made by their predecessors.He answered that in 1920 he would have been willing for such a lump sum payment to be made. He thought that the money could probably have been raised by an internal loan, so that the interest payments would be made to his own people.I replied that this then would seem to be one method which we could still keep in mind as a possible method of settling the present dispute. I hoped that he would not dismiss it as a possibility. But I had been more struck by the other idea which he had mentioned : that the Irish Free State should assume responsibility for certain payments which the United Kingdom authorities made to people in the Irish Free State. I did not think that all these payments put together would by themselves be sufficient to enable us to reach a settlement, but they would go a long way towards that end. The Irish Free State might assume responsibility for that part of the R.I.C. pensions which was paid to people living in the Free State; I believed that would cover about half of the recipients. There were some other small payments under the existing Financial Agreements which would come into the same category. Then, in addition, the Free State Govern-ment would assume liability for the pensions which the United Kingdom Government were at present paying to Ex-Servicemen in the Free State.Mr. de Valera interrupted to say that he did not think the Free State Government could afford that. He understood that our pension payments to Ex-Servicemen in the Free State amounted to about  2,000,000 a year.I replied that the Land Annuity payments which he was withholding had amounted to more than  3,000,000 a year. It was true that the pension payments were at present  2,000,000, but, of course, this would not be a permanent payment.   The sum would gradually dwindle.He said that he thought it would be a long time before it was reduced.I answered that I could only repeat that if he would not assume responsibility for some payment in substitution for the Land Annuities, then the present dispute would continue, and the hope of better relations between our countries would be lost.He said that he presumed that in an agreement based on the principle which we were now discussing, the payments to us on account of local loans would be written off. They were payments by the Irish Free State Government to us, voted annually by the Dail, and could not by any device be treated in any other way.I replied that it seemed to me that they must be included in any settlement, and that in this and similar cases we could adopt the device which he had already mentioned. In order to avoid annual payments by his Government, we might consider the possibility of these liabilities being settled by a lump sum payment. The sum required would be comparatively small and would not be so difficult for them to raise. I thought that we might find the basis of an agreement if we adopted this combination of some liabilities being met by annual payments by the Irish Free State Government to their citizens and others being met by a lump sum payment from the Free State Government to us.Mr. de Valera said that he did not think a settlement on those lines was possible from his point of view. I was suggesting that the Free State should assume a heavy financial burden. They really could not afford to assume it. He at any rate would not be ready to make any such agreement; it might be that some other Government in the Irish Free State would.I replied that such a financial agreement would not stand by itself. It would be coupled with a trade agreement and possibly also an agreement on defence.
6Surely if a general settlement including those three agreements could be reached, people in the Free State would stand to gain a good deal: If we reached a financial agreement, then we would be ready to take off the special duties imposed on Irish Free State imports. That would mean a considerable saving to Irish producers and the prospect of increased trade. In addition, if we could reach a defence agreement, the Irish Free State Government could claim that the British occupation of their ports had come to an end. There would be substantial material and political benefits to be off-set against the liabilities assumed in the financial agreement.Mr. de Valera answered that the removal of our special duties and the negotiation of a trade agreement would certainly be very important considerations in the minds of his people. He could tell me that the tariff war had cost the Free State Government millions of pounds in addition to what it had cost Free State producers in payments of duties. The defence argument would not impress the people of the Free State so greatly. He himself would attach importance to it, and strong Nationalists in the country would also be glad if they gained control of their own ports. But this consideration would be off-set by the new responsibilities which the Free State Government would be assuming in the way of expanding the defence programme&apos;. There would be a good deal of criticism of that, and the additional expenditure that he would propose to incur would really be very heavy. If in addition he undertook to pay the large sums which I had mentioned on account of a new financial agreement, he was afraid the proposition would not be accepted.I answered that the alternative was for us to continue recouping ourselves at the rate of four or five million pounds a year from the special duties. The tariff war would continue, and I really wondered whether in that case the burden on the Free State producers and Treasury would not be heavier. Above all, relations between our two countries would enter a new phase of deterioration, whereas it seemed to me that there was now an opportunity of improving those relations.He admitted that this was true, but said that they were facing some rather difficult problems in the Free State just now which would probably necessitate increased expenditure in other directions. Their people were poor; employment and wage rates had not been good. A considerable emigration from the Free State had recommenced in the last year or two; they were losing population which they would like to keep. His Government had pursued a policy of developing secondary industries which would give better employment and wages to their people, and they had succeeded in doing a good deal. But they had come to a point where he did not think that they could economically pursue that policy any further. Indeed, they might even have to retreat from a little of the ground which &apos; they had occupied. Therefore he was perplexed to find other ways and means of improving the conditions of life of his people. He was having to contemplate increased expenditure on social services in an effort to make life more attractive for them.I replied that it seemed to me that a trade agreement with us would aid him more in this respect than anything else. It would mean that the prospects of his agriculture improved. If his agriculturists became better off, their increased purchasing power would support his other industries.He said that he was inclined to agree with this. But apart from purely &quot;economic considerations, there was also a political difficulty in his concluding the sort of financial agreement which I had suggested. In his view the existing financial agreements were quite unjust; they ought not to have been made, and the Irish people shared that view. The element of prestige was involved in their resistance against a financial agreement which would mean continued large payments by them. He quite understood that we could not agree to the complete wiping out of all payments, and for that reason he had proposed that his increased defence expenditure should become a part of a formal agreement between us. Naturally we should require assurances that the money would really be spent on the ports, the army and so on. He was not quite sure what form the assurances might take, but he would be prepared to give us assurances. Perhaps it could be by an undertaking to maintain a standing army of such and such a size, and similar undertakings with regard to other branches of defence. I had spoken about the desirability of improving relations between the two peoples. He greatly wished for that, and he thought it a great pity that in order to achieve it we were
not ready to recognise their difficulties and to abandon our claims for the other payments, i He-thought that we could afford to do so. It was a pity that we should have to haggle about finance.I replied that I was speaking in no haggling spirit. He and I had the same objective, better relations between the Irish Free State and the United Kingdom. I was concerned with finding a practical basis on which those relations could be established, and it was no use imagining that a part of that basis could be a financial agreement which people in Great Britain would not accept as just. I then asked whether he could give me some greater detail regarding his conception of a defence agreement between us. He knew the importance which we attached to an assurance about the use of the ports in time of war; I knew that he felt it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to give that assurance. Assuming for the moment that our Governments could devise a means of overcoming that difficulty, what did he mean when he spoke of co-operation in defence matters ?He answered that if we could get an agreement and the way was clear for him to proceed with a defence programme, he would ask our military experts to advise him on the items of that programme. He would rely largely on their advice, and would, as far as possible, adopt their proposals. He thought that we should work out a defence plan in common. When it came to the point of ordering materials he would want to get the same sort of equipment for his forces as we had for ours. We should have interchangeable equipment, because our forces would co-operate together. Of course, his defence forces would be very small in comparison with ours. He did not suppose that they would ever grow to a size when the Irish Free State could send an expeditionary force to fight on the Continent, but our forces would need to be ready to co-operate together in defence of our two islands.I asked him whether he would be ready, if our experts thought it a good idea, to establish a munitions factory in the Irish Free State; it would be of value to his Government and to ours in case of war.He replied that he would certainly be prepared to do this. He thought it a good idea. Some of his people&apos;would criticise it, just as they had criticised the establishment of the air base on the Shannon, saying that he was putting the Free State into subjection to Great Britain. But he would be able to carry the great majority of his people with him.I remarked that a munitions factory would also help him in the domestic problems of finding employment for his people, which he had just mentioned. It seemed to me that if we could get a general settlement of the three outstanding questions which we had been discussing, he could show that the people of Southern Ireland were going to get many advantages in return for the financial agreement about which he felt so doubtful.He replied that the Irish people would certainly get some advantages. But, generally speaking, his people, unlike himself, would not appreciate the advantages of the defence agreement. They were nervous of being dragged into some Imperialist war which we might wage in defence of some outlandish part of the Empire. They did not want to fight for India or other of our possessions far away. In the Irish Free State they really did not care about the Empire; they could not take the same pride in it which we in Great Britain did; they had not been so much concerned in the making of it, and had suffered a good deal at our Imperialist hands.I remarked that I could quite understand that many Irishmen did not feel very enthusiastic about some of our Imperial history. But the Empire had developed in recent years; in the course of its evolution its great purpose, the spreading of freedom amongst its peoples, had become more apparent. Irishmen might well feel pride in the new Empire. The relationship between our two islands should be that of the two Mother Countries of a world-wide Commonwealth of free Nations. They should be bound by the most cordial spirit of friendship and co-operation.  -He said that he fully agreed with that ideal. It was because of it that he had become an advocate of the Commonwealth connection. But the idea would take a long time to grow amongst his people. However, it would grow in time. Speaking not as President of the Irish Free State Executive Council conversing with a Secretary of State, but as one man to another, he would say that the new friendship for Great Britain amongst his people would exist in fact long before it was named and proclaimed by National leaders in Ireland. It was difficult for them to speak much about it in public; his people&apos;s memories were bitter,
and politicians who spoke too much of friendship would be suspect. But goodwill would come if we gave it a chance, though it would take fifty or a hundred years to grow to its full strength.I said that if it was going to take as long as that the sooner we started the process the better. The United Kingdom Government were not haggling for money, but were trying to establish conditions which would introduce a happier chapter in the relations of the two countries. I very much hoped that he would not close his mind to the sort of suggestions which I had been making informally to him.He answered that he would not close his mind to them, but that he could hold out &quot;very little hope&quot; that such proposals would prove acceptable. However, he hoped that we would make some proposals. He did not think that it was any good his Government, taking the initiative on the financial question, because it was clear that any proposals that they could put forward would appear so inadequate to us that they would not be a basis for discussion.I replied that I would report our conversation to my colleagues. It might be that we would decide that it was worth while making some proposals; or we might decide that the prospect was not such as to justify our making any further attempt now to settle the difficulties between us. In any case, I would communicate again with him after we had reached a decision.He said that he thought our conversations were very useful, even if they did not result in practical agreements. They showed each side that the other was animated by a real desire for friendly relations.M. M.
