fHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.)E C R E T. .P. 246(57) .COPYm.?9CABINETAMENDMENT OP NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE ACT. Memorandum by Minister of Health.1. I seek, the concurrence of my colleagues in theintroduction at the earliest possible date of a one-clause Bill to correct an unfortunate error of drafting in the National Health Insurance and Contributory Pensions Act, 1935 The provision in question was enacted as Section 10 of that Act, and on consolidation has now become Section 2(2) of the National Health Insurance Act, 1936.2. The object of this provision, which came intooperation on the 2nd August, 1935, was to exclude from insurance as an employed contributor any person who, having been the owner of a business and therefore uninsured, transfers his business to a relative on approaching pensionable age and becomes employed in the business, thus qualifying for an old age pension on a short period of insurance.3. This should have been done by adding employment ofthe kind in question to the list of excepted employments in Part II of the First Schedule to the principal Act, but in fact the 1935 Clause was so worded as to exclude persons so employed from insurance while not excluding their employment from the field of employment within the meaning of the Act. The effect is to deprive such persons of certain valuable rights which normally accrue to those who pass out of the scope of compulsory insurance.      These rights are dependent in terms of the Act, upon the cessation of employment within
the meaning of the Act, and include not only a &quot;free in-surance period&quot; of 18 to 24 months during which a person remains eligible for all health insurance benefits and widows&apos;, orphans&apos;  and Old age pensions, but more important still,  a title to maintain insurance by becoming a voluntary contributor,,40 That this is the effect of the Section was con-firmed by a decision on 20th October,  1937,  in the High Court (the Lord Chief Justice presiding)  In the case of Whyatt v.  the Minister of Health, which arose out of the rejection of a claim for an old age pension.,5o THe persons concerned were liable to compulsory insurance under the law as it stood before 2nd August, 1935, and I am satisfied that it is not possible to defend a provision which takes them out of compulsory insurance without conferring upon them the rights which accrue to employed contributors who cease to be insurably employed,, I am informed, moreover,  that my Department has already received more than 30 claims for widows&apos;  and old age pensions which must fail on the true construction of the relevant Section as now worded.,6e The Department of Health for Scotland and theTreasury concur in these proposals, and I should be glad to have authority to proceed accordingly0(initialled) k1\V0inistry of Health, 12th November, 1937*
