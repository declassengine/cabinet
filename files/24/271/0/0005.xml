[This Document is the Property oi His Britannic Majesty^ Ctoveinment,SECRET.CP. 205 (37).Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1937.Copy No.CABINET.Use of Tear Gas against unlawful Assemblies in India.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.On 14th October 1936 the Cabinet approved a proposal which had been submitted to me by the Government of India that the Punjab Government should be permitted to use tear gas against unlawful assemblies, subject to the following conditions : (a) That suitable equipment and police trained in its use are available ; and(b) That the Local Government is satisfied that the occasion and circum-stances are appropriate for the use of tear gas.The Cabinet also authorised me to permit any other Local Government, which might wish to follow the example of the Punjab, to use tear gas on the same conditions.In communicating this decision to the Government of India I informed them that in the event of tear gas being used in the Punjab in the near future under this authority, it would be the first occasion of its employment against crowds in any part of the Empire, and that for that reason I regarded it as of the greatest importance that before taking a decision to make use of it the Punjab authorities should satisfy themselves that the occasion really demanded such measures, that the use of tear gas could be fully justified on grounds of humanity, and that it stood a good chance of being used successfully. I also informed the Government of India that I should be prepared to consider the question of its use in any other Province in which conditions were appropriate. Subsequently, in pursuance of the above authority, I approved a proposal of the Government of India for the employment of the Punjab gas squad in neighbouring Provinces to which it could conveniently be sent, pending the completion of the training of local gas squads, in the event of the Provincial Government concerned considering that a suitable occasion had arisen for its employment before the use of tear gas had actually been tried out in the Punjab. I also informed the Government of India that I agreed that it was desirable to proceed with the training of gas squads in other Provinces, and that when the necessary equipment had been completed in any Province permission to use tear gas might be given under the conditions laid down for the Punjab.The Government of India delayed the communication of these decisions to Provincial Governments, pending the completion of certain technical experiments. In the meantime, Provincial Autonomy has been inaugurated, and the Government of India have reached the conclusion that there is no provision in the Act of 1935 which gives the Governor-General in Council control over the use of tear gas by the police if this were authorised by a Provincial Government, and that, accordingly, they have no power to compel Provincial Governments to observe any restrictions on its use either as a direction from myself or as a direction in exercise of the executive authority of the Central Government. I am fully satisfied and have informed the Government of India accordingly that this is the correct view of the constitutional position, although it is of course open to a Governor in any particular case to prohibit the use of tear gas in pursuance of his special responsibility for the prevention of any grave menace to the peace and tranquillity of the Province, if in his view the circumstances were such as to justify such a step.In these circumstances it has not been possible to impose on Provincial Governments the conditions on which the Cabinet approved the use of tear gas against mobs in India, in October last. The Government of India have, however, in informing Provincial Governments of the experiments which have been made in connection with the use of tear gas, intimated to them the conditions on which I had authorised the use of gas before the 1st of April, and while pointing out to them that the question whether to authorise the use of tear gas is now a matter for each Government to decide on its own responsibility, have suggested that, if any Government decides to authorise its use, these conditions will no doubt commend themselves as a proper and necessary precaution.India Office,Z.24th August 1937.6431Wt 8177/R.D.P. 8   85   8.37
