(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.)SECRET. CP.549(57) .COPY NO.CABINET. SUPERANNUATION (VARIOUS SERVICES) BILL. Memorandum &quot;by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.1. The Law Officers have advised that legislation isnecessary to permit the application to various staffs, who do not come directly under the Superannuation Acts 1834-1935 hut who under statute are pensioned on civil service terms, of Section 2 of the Superannuation Act, 1935, which enables a retiring civil servant to provide a pension (either at once or on his death) for his wife or other dependant by surrendering a part of his own pension.The reason for this opinion is that the Acts applicable to these staffs only authorise the grant of pension to the officers themselves, whereas Section 2 authorises the grant of a separate pension to the wife or dependant.The Staffs concerned and the controlling Departments are as follows:-Staff.2.3.4. 5.Administrative and clerical staff of the Metropolitan Police Office.Staff paid from the General Lighthouse Fund.Development Commission&apos;s staff.Forestry Commission&apos;s staff.(i) Electricity Commission&apos;s staff.(ii) Staff of the Crinan and Caledonian Canals.Department. Home Office.Board of Trade.Development Commission.Forestry Commission. Ministry of transport ministry of Transport.Assessor of Public Undertakings    Scottish Office. (Scotland) and his staff.
(The Greenwich Hospital employees are in the same position, hut as other points arise the Admiralty prefer to deal with the Hospital by a Bill to amend the Greenwich Hospital Acts.)2. Certain other grants v/hich are authorised by the superannuation Acts to be made to civil servants or their dependants are not authorised by the relevant Statute in the case of some of these groups of staff, while the legal position in other cases is doubtful.     These grants are:-(a) Payments to legal representatives of establishedofficers dying during service or shortly after retirement, commonly known as &quot;death gratuities&quot;.(b) Grants otherwise    than under the Workmen1 s CompensationActs to officers injured on duty or in case of fatal injury to their dependants.The Bill extends the&quot; relevant Statutes and brings them into line with the Superannuation Acts.The Departments concerned are anxious to apply the benefits in 1 and 2 to the staffs in question.3. In&apos; the case of the General Lighthouse Staffs the Board ofTrade have without statutory authority granted since 1909, when the benefit was introduced, the death gratuities authorised by the Superannuation Acts for civil servants.      They have similarly without statutory authority undertaken to grant to this staff the benefits provided by Section 2 of the Superannuation Act, 1935. The Public Accounts Committee have taken note of the position on these two points and;.in their second report for 1936 (paragraph 20) have expressed the hope that the introduction of legislation,which they were informed was contemplated, will not be unduly postponed.4. Subject to Cabinet authority, the Financial Secretary tothe Treasury will introduce a Bill for this purpose, which will confer on the Departments any powers which they at present lack to apply the complete civil service pension code to their staffs.
33*1:A Bill for this purpose v/as provisionally approved by the Home Affairs Committee last year hut its details could not he settled in time for it to he introduced last session.The Bill has now been drafted and has been approved by the Departments concerned.The authority of the Cabinet is sought for the introduction of the Bill, which should be non-controversial, as early as possible.(Intd.) J.S.Treasury Chambers, 19th October, 1937.
