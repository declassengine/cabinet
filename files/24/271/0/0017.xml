THIS DOCUMENT IS TUB PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MATESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT. SECRET.CP.  217 (57). COPY NO.CABINET.MERCHANT NAVY OFFICERS&apos;  PENSION SCHEME.Memorandum by the president of the Board of Trade.I desire authority to proceed with the preparation of a short Bill to amend Section 163 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, which in its present form is an obstacle to the introduction of the voluntary national pensions scheme for officers in the Merchant Navy recently prepared by the National Maritime Board.At present,  only a small number of Merchant Navy officers receive pensions under schemes operated by the particular Companies to which they belong.    The officers&apos; Panels of the National Maritime Board, which is fully representative of both sides of the shipping industry, have decided to institute a national pensions scheme for Merchant Navy officers so as to secure that all Masters, Deck and Engineer Officers employed on ships which engage their crews in the United Kingdom on Board of Trade Articles, whether employed in the foreign, home or coasting trades,  (about 32,000 in number) shall be entitled on retirement to a pension.The National Maritime Board wish to bring the pensions scheme into operation on the 1st January, 1938.      The scheme is to be contributory, financed by payments equal to 7i per cent of the officer&apos;s salary (half payable by the officer and half by the shipowner).      I may add that it has also been agreed that the salaries of all officers are to be increased by the amount of their pensions contributions on the date on which the scheme is brought into operation.
Officers serving in Companies which already have pension schemes will not necessarily he brought within the National Maritime Board national scheme whilst remaining in the employment of those Companies, but these private schemes are estimated to cover less than 5 per cent of the total number of officers employed in the Mercantile Marine.Both the employers1 and the officers&apos; organisations agree that,  if the national scheme is to operate satisfactorily, it is essential that all officers,  other than those covered by existing Companies&apos;  schemes,  should be included,  and they are also agreed that officers must agree on engagement to the deduction of the pensions contribution from the wages due.There is, however, a legal obstacle to this in Section 163 of the Merchant Shipping Act,  1894.    That Section provides that:    &quot;As respects wages due or accruing to a seaman or apprentice to the sea service ......... an assignment or salethereof made prior to the accruing thereof shall not hind the person making the same&quot;.    The legal authorities who have examined this Section on behalf of the industry are satisfied that an agreement on engagement to the deduction of the pensions contribution from the wages due at the end of the voyage would be an assignment of wages within the meaning of this section, and could be voided by an officer at any time.    I am advised that this view is right.The desirability of some such scheme as that which is now proposed by the National Maritime Board is clear.    It would give the officers in the Mercantile Navy a life interest in their profession, and would be a very big step forward,    in these circumstances, I think the Section of the Merchant Shipping Act above referred to should be altered so as to permit of the assignment of wages for the purpose of pensions contributions, and that every possible step should be taken to secure the necessary amendment in time to enable the national pension scheme for officers to come into operation at the beginning of next year.
The necessary amending Bill would he a one-clause Bill and should he non-controversial.    The amendment would he in general terms and would covor the assignment of wages by any officer, seaman, or apprentice, for the purpose of pension contributions,  so that no further amendment would be required if at any time a pension scheme for men in the Mercantile Marine should be contemplated.    Public opinion is likely to be. in favour of the speedy passage through parliament of the Bill, particularly when it is realised that the urgency is due to the desire of both the shipowners and the officers to bring the scheme into operation on the 1st January, 1938.I should be glad to have the authority of my colleagues for the preparation and submission to the Home Affairs Committee of a Bill embodying the proposal for legislation outlined above and for pressing on with arrangements to secure the passage of the Bill into law by the 31st December next.Board of Trade,23rd September, 1937.O.P.G.S.
