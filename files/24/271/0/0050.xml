ty t) (J(THIS    DOCUMENT    IS    THE    PROPERTY   OF HIS    BRITANNIC   MAJEST Y&apos;S    GOVERNMENT).SECRET. COPY   NO.   . .*ftf?. .CP.250(37) .CABINET.LEGISLATION ON HOUSING. Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Health.1.     Provision is made in the Housing Act, 1936, for the review by order of the Exchequer contributions payable for slum clearance and the abatement of overcrowding, which at present are only authorised for houses to be completed by 31st March, 1938.2.      I have already undertaken with the consent of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that in any review to be made I will propose that the existing rates should be payable for houses completed by 31st December, 1938,  and action will be needed to implement this promise and to provide for the future.3.     Under the existing legislation there is a substantial Exchequer contribution payable for slum clearance based on the number of persons displaced and rehoused, and a comparatively small contribution payable only in certain circumstances for the rehousing of overcrowded persons, based on the number of new houses built.4.      I am satisfied that there is no sufficient reason for maintaining this distinction between the forms of subsidy and accordingly propose that for houses completed after 31st December, 1938,  the Exchequer contributions payable for slum clearance and the abatement of overcrowding should be of equal amount and in each case the payment should be based on the number of new houses built.
9 9^5.     For this purpose it will be necessary to deal with the question by legislation as distinct from order,  and the new legislation I propose is(a) to implement the promise to continue contributions on the existing basis for houses completed between the 31st March, 1938 and the 31st December, 1938;(b) to authorise contributions on the new basis for a further period of approximately 3 years from 31st December, 1938.6.      It is proposed in the same legislation to provide for Exchequer contributions towards the general housing needs for agricultural workers,  in accordance with a recommendation made by the Central Housing Advisory Committee in a recent report which they have submitted to the Minister.It is contemplated that the Exchequer contributions for this purpose will be on the same basis and of the same amount as those to be made available for slum clearance and the abatement of overcrowding among the agricultural population7.     The&apos;details of the new proposals will require to be discussed with the Associations of Local Authorities and I propose to enter into these discussions forthwith.      It is contemplated that the figures to be fixed for the new contributions will not make any appreciable addition to that which would be involved by the continuance of the existing legislation.8.     It is estimated that the programme remaining to be carried out after 31st December, 1938, for slum, clearance and the abatement of overcrowding will be about 360,000 houses and, including provision for a continuance of special rates of contribution for flats on.expensive sites and for agricultural cottages,  the cost of completing this programme is estimated at about  2,200,000 a year for a period of 40 years.
9.     At the present rate of progress something more than half this programme would be carried out before a further review of the terms of financial assistance becomes operative.10.      The proposals have been discussed with the Treasury. 11.      It will be ne cess ary, that the legislation should be passed through all its stages before 31st March, 1938.I should be glad to have authority to prepare and submit to the Home Affairs Committee a Bill giving effect to the proposals outlined in this Memorandum.K. W.October 20th, 1937.
