IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).E C R E T. P.  235 (57).COPY NOCABINET.CALCIUM CARBIDE.Memorandum by the Minister for Co-ordination &apos; of Defence.In pursuance of the Cabinet decision of the 24th of March (Cabinet 13 (37) Conclusion 12) I appointed a Sub- ^Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence to consider and report as to the relative advantages of any schemes which may be submitted to them for the production of calcium carbide and allied products in the United Kingdom.2. The Sub-Committee consisted of Sir Ernest Harvey,late Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, as Chairman, Mr. Peter Bennett of Messrs.  Joseph Lucas &amp; Co. , Vice-chairman of the Federation of British Industries, and Mr.  T. Lodge, late member of the Commission of Government in Newfoundland, with Sir Gilbert Morgan, Director of the Chemical Research Laboratory at Teddington as Technical Assessor.3. The Sub-Committee received and considered a number of proposals and finally recommended the proposal of the British Oxygen Company.    This proposal is for the erection of two factories, one at Port Talbot in South Wales and the other at Corpach in the Highlands, this latter being the works contemplated in the Caledonian Power Bill, the rejection of which by the House on Second Reading led to the setting up of the Committee.4. Not only the British Oxygen Company, but also allproposers of schemes laid down as a condition of proceeding
that present prices of the product should he maintained at any rate during the period when the new industry is being developed.5* The Sub-Committee&apos;s Report was considered by myself,the Secretary of State for Scotland, the President of the Board of Trade and the Minister of Labour, and it was agreed that I should discuss further with the British Oxygen Company their proposal, with particular reference to two points, the claim to maintenance of prices above mentioned, and the question of some guarantee that, if the Government support the Corpach scheme in Parliament, the Company would in fact proceed with the Port Talbot scheme, which involves no legislation.6.. As the result of these discussions, the Company haveagreed again to promote the Caledonian Power Bill, subject to the support of the Government being given, to proceed immediately with the establishment of a first stage carbide unit at Port Talbot and thereafter, if required, to go forward to the Import Duties Advisory Committee with an application for protection.    On being granted the protection required, they would be in a position to go forward with the full development of their whole scheme in accordance with the country&apos;s requirements.7. The difficulty as to a tariff is that calcium carbide has free admission by virtue of the trade agreements with Norway and Sweden.    This difficulty the Company propose to meet by negotiation with the Norwegian and Swedish interests for a quota agreement over a period of years: with such an agreement, they anticipate that no difficulty would be raised about modifying the trade agreements so as to enable a duty to be imposed, if found necessary after consideration by the Import Duties Advisory Committee.
8. I have discussed these proposals with mycolleagues and we ax-e agreed in recommending them to the Cabinet, as the best method of promoting the production of calcium carbide and allied products in this country, which has been more than once stated in the House of Commons to be most important in the interests of defence.9. I should add that, in order not to lose a Sessionof parliament, the British Oxygen Company have instructed their solicitors again to lodge the provisional Order for the Caledonian power Scheme and this will be done on the 30th of November.     The report of the C.I.D. sub-Committee cannot be published, for most of the evidence was given to it on pledge of secrecy.     Some statement will have to be made on the matter, preferably before the 20th instant, or at all events at or about that date.      If, as I hope, the Cabinet approve the conclusion reached by myself and my colleagues,  I suggest that I be authorised to arrange for a question and answer as follows:-Question:    To ask the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence whether the Government have arrived at a decision on the Report of the Committee on Calcium Carbide. Answer:       Yes, Sir.      The Committee, after full consideration of a number of schemes submitted to them for the production of calcium carbide and allied products in the united Kingdom, recommended the scheme submitted to them by the British
Oxygen Company.     This scheme provides for the erection of two factories, one at Port Talhot in South Wales, the other at Corpach in the West Highlands.      I have since had further discussions with the British Oxygen company and have arrived at a basis of settlement with them which is accepted by the Government as satisfactory. As part of this settlement the Company are taking the necessary steps to reintroduce the Caledonian Water power Bill.(intld.)    T.17.H.I.Whitehall Gardens, S.V/.1. 11th November, 1937.
