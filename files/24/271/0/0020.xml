THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1937.SECRET.Copy-No.CP. 220 (37).CABINET.PROPOSALS FOR THE AMENDMENT OF THE CEYLONCONSTITUTION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I WISH to lay before my colleagues certain difficulties which have arisen in connection with the exercise by the Governor of Ceylon of the powers given to him by the Ceylon (State Council) Order in Council of 1931.2. That Order was based on the recommendations of the Special Commission presided over by the Earl of Donoughmore which reported in 1928. It established a constitution which experience has shown to require amendment in more than one direction; for the moment I confine myself to discussion of the provisions which give the Governor certain. overriding powers of control, particularly in matters relating to the public services.3. It is in relation to the public services, to the appointment, promotion and dismissal of public officers, and to the fixing of their conditions of service, that practically all the disputes between the Governor, the Ministers and the State Council have arisen.1. The essential articles of the Order in Council are quoted in the appendices to this memorandum. In brief, Article 86* vests ,the appointment, promotion and disciplinary control of public officers in the Governor, subject to the instructions of the Secretary of State. Article 87* provides that no bill or motion or proposal involving any alteration in the conditions of service of certain classes of public officers, which in the opinion of the Governor is to the prejudice of such officers, shall take effect without the ^approval of the Secretary of State; and any bill, &amp;c, the passage of which is necessary to preserve any rights which may not be varied without the approval of the Secretary of State shall be deemed to be essential to give effect to the provisions of the Order within the meaning of Article 22. t5. Article 22 empowers the Governor, when he considers that any bill or motion is &quot;of paramount importance to ,the public interest, or essential to give effect to any of the provisions of this Order,&quot; to authorise an Officer of State to propose any such bill, &amp;c, in the State Council, and to make a declaration accordingly; whereupon the bill, &amp;c, shall have effect as if it had been passed by the Council.6. The recommendation of the Special Commission was to the effect that &quot;the power to enact legislation should rest absolutely in the Governor himself and no voting on the bill should be required.&quot; The somewhat obscure provisions of Article .22 were in part adapted from the Order governing the former Legis-lative Council, and were no doubt intended to give opportunity for reasonable explanation and debate in the State Council whenever the Governor exercised his special powers.7. Taking advantage of the obscurity of the terms of Article 22, however, the State Council have, with the connivance of the Deputy Speaker, deliberately and repeatedly obstructed the legitimate exercise of the Governors powers, in the following circumstances.8. It has been held by successive Secretaries of State that the salaries of the commissioned ranks of the Ceylon Police were inadequate. Action for their increase had been deferred for some years, partly on account of the depression in* Appendix II.f Appendix1!.[15882]B
2the finances, and afterwards in the hope that the necessity for the increase would commend itself to the State Council. Finally, a resolution providing for the increase was introduced in the Council with the approval of the Board of Ministers, but was rejected by the Council. The Governor accordingly recom-mended that the vote should be carried by the use of his reserve powers; and this recommendation had my entire approval. The Governor accordingly authorised the Financial Secretary to introduce a motion in the State Council, under Article 22, providing for the payment of the increased salaries.9. A member of the Council thereupon moved that consideration of the Financial Secretary&apos;s motion should be postponed. This motion was accepted by the Deputy Speaker, and carried by the State Council; so that the further proceedings contemplated in Article 22 could not be taken.10. At a subsequent meeting of the State Council, the Financial Secretary&apos;s motion was again introduced, and the same procedure was followed by the Deputy Speaker and the State Council.11. As it was clear that it was the intention of the State Council to repeat these obstructive tactics, however often the motion of the Financial Secretary was introduced, the Governor decided, with my approval, to proceed by way of message to the Speaker, declaring the motion with regard to the salaries of Police Officers to be one of &quot;paramount importance to the public interest.&quot; This message was read by the Speaker, who announced that the motion would, under Article 22, have effect as if it had been passed by the State Council.12. Protests have already been received against this procedure, and it is clear that every effort will be made by members of the State Council to obstruct any motion introduced by an Officer of State under Article 22 of the Order in Council. In particular, the question whether any motion can properly be held to be of &apos;&apos; paramount importance &apos;&apos; is likely to be a matter of acute controversy on each occasion. Further, since, as explained above, such motions usually relate to the conditions of service of public officers, opportunity will be given on each occasion for acrimonious attacks on public officers, to the detriment of the morale of the public service.13. I regard it as impossible to allow the powers granted by the constitution to be whittled away by placing a construction on the Order which was never intended by its framers.14. The Order was issued four years before the passage of the Government of India Act. I think it probable that, if the framers of the Order had had the Act before them, they would have embodied certain of its provisions in place of those devised by the Special Commission. In particular, I think that it would have been advisable, as an alternative to Article 22, to have included a provision on the lines of section 44* of the Act, which gives the Governor-General certain definite powers of legislation. Further, since nearly all the causes of dispute between the Governor and the State Council in Ceylon have related to the public service, and since the constant attacks on the conditions of the essential services are obviously detrimental to efficiency, it would have been advisable to include in the Ceylon Order provisions on the lines of sections 244t to 247 of the Act, applicable to the Civil and Police Services and the Judiciary, the efficient maintenance of which is essential to the full exercise by the Governor of his responsibilities. Under these sections the conditions of service of officers in the essential services are under the sole authority of the Secretary of State.15. While the obstructive attitude of the State Council in the matter of the police salaries has made it necessary to consider the possibility of amending the Order in Council so as to define more clearly and to render more effective the powers of the Governor, I have also to report that insistent demands for the amendment of the Order in other directions have been pressed upon me from Ceylon, and have recently formed, for the second time, the subject of a memorandum addressed to me by the Board of Ministers.1.6. It is unnecessary at the moment to discuss these demands in detail, but they may be summarized under two heads : (1) For the relaxation or withdrawal of certain of the powers reserved to the Governor and the Secretary of State.In accord with my predecessors, I have made it clearly understood that I do not consider that the time has come to entertain proposals of this nature. On the contrary, as I have indicated above, I consider that those powers should be more clearly emphasized and defined.* Appendix III. -f- Appendix IV.
APPENDIX I.Ceylon (State Council) Order in Council, 1931.22. (1) If the Governor shall consider that it is of paramount importance to the public interest, or essential to give effect to any of the provisions of this Order, that any Bill, motion, resolution, or vote which the Council is empowered to pass, in the exercise of either its legislative or its executive functions, should have effect, then in such case, notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Order or of any Standing Orders made under this Order (a) it shall be lawful for any Officer of State, acting by the authority andunder the instructions of the Governor, to propose any such Bill, motion, resolution, or vote to the Council and the same shall have priority over all other business of the Council;(b) the Governor may declare that any such Bill, or any part of any suchBill or any such motion, resolution, or vote is of paramount importance or is essential to give effect to the provisions of this Order, and there-upon such Bill, part of a Bill, motion, resolution, or vote shall have effect as if it had been passed by the Council. Such declaration may be made by the Governor by message addressed to the Speaker or by an Officer of State, acting by the authority and on the instructions of the Governor, either before or after the votes of the members have been taken.(2) Any Bill which shall have effect, in whole or in part, by reason of a declaration made by the Governor in accordance with this Article, shall be expressed to be enacted by the Governor and, upon being signed by the Governor, shall be of the same force and effect as though it had been passed by the Council [15882] b 2(2) For certain changes in the method of election of Ministers, and in the relations between Ministers, Executive Committees, and the State Council; and in the position of the Officers of State.17. I have been impressed, as were my predecessors, by the fact that the existing arrangements do not tend to efficiency, to the selection of the best men as Ministers, or to their effective co-operation in the business of government. There are, however, difficulties in devising an alternative scheme which not only will be an improvement, but also will be accepted by all the communities in Ceylon. I have therefore intended that the position should be examined by Sir Andrew Caldecott, the new Governor, and that when he has had time to form a considered opinion he should submit recommendations for my consideration.18. In considering any such recommendations, regard will be had to the provisions which it has been thought desirable to include in the constitution for Burma.19. Meanwhile, however, both Sir Edward Stubbs and the Acting Governor regard the amendment of Article 22 of the Order in Council as a matter of urgency, in view of the evident intention of the State Council to obstruct the exercise of the Governors powers.Conclusion.20. I therefore seek the approval of my colleagues for the submission to the King in Council of an amending Order in Council bringing the Governor&apos;s powers more into line with the powers given to the Governor-General by the Government of India Act, and placing beyond doubt, on the lines of the Govern-ment of India Act, the authority of the Secretary of State over the salaries and conditions of service of the essential public services, namely, the Civil Service, the Police and the Judiciary. I would point out that such an amending Order would only make fully operative the powers which the Donoughmore Commission clearly intended the Governor to possess and would not prejudice the future amendment of those provisions of the constitution which do not affect the powers of the Governor and the Secretary of State.(Initialled) W. O. G.Colonial Office, September 22, 1937.
and had received the Governors assent and shall be subject to disallowance by His Majesty in like manner; and all the provisions of this Order which relate to Bills passed by the Council, or to the assent of the Governor to such Bills, shall apply to Bills enacted by the Governor in accordance with this Article, or to the signing of such Bills by him, as the case may require.APPENDIX II.Ceylon (State Council) Order :in Council, 1931.86.
