Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1937.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 202 (37).CABINET.ANGLO-GERMAN RELATIONS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues the annexed correspondence with His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Berlin, arising out of a remark by General Goring to Sir N. Henderson about&apos;&apos; the danger of allowing the German people to continue indefinitely to regard England as the enemy in their path.&quot;Sir N. Henderson has, on my instructions, sought to obtain from General Goring a clear definition of Germany&apos;s aims and a precise statement as to the manner in which, and the occasions on which, the action and policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government have, in the general&apos;s opinion, prevented or are preventing the German Government from obtaining their objective.The results of Sir N. Henderson&apos;s first interview with General Goring on this subject, recorded in his despatch No. 678 of the 20th July, 1937, do not furnish a clear or satisfactory answer to our enquiry, but Sir N. Henderson will pursue the question further on his return from leave in the autumn.A. E.July 30, 1937.No. 1.Sir N. Henderson to Mr. Eden.-(Received May 26.) (No. 325.   Saving.   Important.)(Telegraphic.) Berlin, May 25, 1937.1 CALLED on General Goring yesterday. He pleaded at length necessity of Anglo-German co-operation, which should in no way be exclusive of France, and he laid great stress on Herr Hitler&apos;s sincere desire for this consummation. There had, he said, never been and might never be again any German leader so set upon good relations between the two countries. He quoted Naval Agreement and renunciation of Alsace-Lorraine as proofs of his sincerity.General Goring referred to danger of allowing German people to continue indefinitely to regard England as enemy in their path. He mentioned that until now he had always refused to allow German air force to indulge in war games with England as the enemy, on the ground that he did not wish to encourage even the idea of such a possibility. He had, however, recently been unable to resist pressure brought upon him to provide against a contingency which had begun to appear to Germans as inevitable, and he had recently and reluctantly authorised this precaution..9414   [15679] b
Italian friendship was, said General Goring, not at all popular with the German people, but Germany had no alternative but to make friends where she could find them. In spite of this, there was, he asserted, still nothing binding in Germany&apos;s relations with either Italy or Japan.As regards economic questions, General Goring said that raw material problem was the crux of the whole matter, and he linked this up with revision of article 16 of the Covenant, which, I understood him to argue, deterred German merchants from investing money abroad.When I mentioned my interview with Dr. Schacht, he repeated, with some irritation, the identical words used by Baron von Neurath as reported in my telegram No. 320, Saving : &quot; The colonies were,&quot; he said, &quot; Dr. Schacht&apos;s hobby, but were not regarded by Herr Hitler or himself as of same immediate importance.&quot; Moreover, Dr..: Schacht, he added, both as president of the Reichsbank and Minister for Economics, came under his own orders as Ftihrer&apos;s representative in charge of the Four-Year Plan.(Repeated to Geneva, No. 13, Saving.)No. 2.Air. Eden to Sir N. Henderson (Berlin).(No. 687.)Sir, Foreign Office, June 4, 11)37.IN the second paragraph of your telegram No. 325, Saving, of the 25th May your Excellency reported that, in your conversation with him on the preceding day, General Goring had referred to the danger of allowing the &quot; German people to continue indefinitely to regard England as the enemy in their path.&apos;&apos;2. I feel that to let this remark pass without comment would be practic-ally to acquiesce in the view that His Majesty&apos;s Government have recently been pursuing an anti-German policy. This is not the first time that a suggestion of this sort has been put forward. It was implied by General Goring in his speech of the 29th October last in Berlin; it was suggested by him in the interview reported in Sir Eric Phipps&apos;s telegram No. 241, Saving, of the 13th April; and it appeared in Lord Lothian&apos;s account of his recent conversa-tions with the Chancellor and General Goring.3. Your conversation with General Goring appears to be a good opportunity-nity for challenging these generalised complaints against His Majesty&apos;s Government and I shall be glad if you will seek an early opportunity of telling General Goring that, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the German people are harbouring an imaginary grievance. You should then ask General Goring to explain exactly the grounds on which the German people continue to regard England as the enemy in their path and to state what actions on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government have led the German people to conceive such an erroneous and dangerous idea.4. Your Excellency will no doubt appreciate the desirability of insisting on a definite statement and of not allowing Genex*al Goring to take refuge in further vague generalities. You should, however, make it clear that you are seeking elucidation, not for the purpose of sterile recrimination, nOr in order to controvert his views by argument, but simply so that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment may be in a position to know what exactly is in General Goring&apos;s mind, to remove any genuine misunderstandings which may exist, and thereby to further the common objective of both His Majesty&apos;s Government and the German Government, which is to ameliorate the situation between Great Britain, Germany and France and to secure a closer measure of co-operation between the three Governments in the interest of European stabilisation as a whole.I am, &amp;c.ANTHONY EDEN.
No. 3.Sir N. Henderson to Mr. Eden. (Received June 10.)(No. 551.)Sir, Berlin, June 8, 1937.I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch No. 687 of the 4th instant in which you refer to the statement made to me by General Goring in the course of my interview with him on the 24th May, regarding &quot; the danger of allowing the German people to continue indefinitely to regard England as the enemy in their path.&apos;&apos;2. On the occasion of that interview I emphatically stigmatised this attitude of mind as being as fallacious as it was mischievous. But in point of fact General Goring was merely expressing an opinion which is very widely held here; so widely, indeed, that I was deeply impressed on my arrival here by the obvious and serious danger of allowing it to continue unchecked.3. It was entirely on this account that I made the speech which I did on the occasion of the German-English Society dinner on the 1st June. Most of the Nazi party leaders attended that banquet and it afforded me an opportunity of publicly refuting before a large audience this dangerous grievance.4. I have reason to believe that that speech has to some extent served its purpose in this country. Indeed, ever since my first address to Herr Hitler on the 11th May, which I composed with the same object in view, the violent press attacks on England which filled the papers during my first ten days&apos; residence in this country have calmed down on instructions from above. Nevertheless, imaginary grievance or not, the fact remains that the Germans, including the more reasonable and moderate such as Baron von Neurath (see paragraph 5 of Sir E. Phipps&apos;s telegram No. 246, Saving), and Hitler, no less than Goring, still believe that it is substantially justified; and words alone will not dispel it.5. In my conversations with leading Germans here, with Goring as with others, I have not allowed the generalised grievance to pass unchallenged. Their replies have invariably been on the lines of paragraphs 8 and 19 of my predeces-sor&apos;s despatch No. 358 of the 13th April. For the benefit of clarity I venture to quote those two paragraphs in extenso : &quot; 8. There is now a general feeling that England is deliberately reject-ing the proffered hand of German friendship and that the policy of Anglo-German understanding is breaking down. There is, it is said, no German aspiration, however legitimate, which England does not resist. Jealous of Germany&apos;s qualities, she is determined to oppose the recovery of the colonies, the acquisition of new markets, the &apos; Anschluss &apos; with Austria, and a settle-ment of the Danzig and Memel problems, not to mention expansion c to the east,&apos; where no British interest is concerned. When General Goring, in his speech at the Sportpalast on the 28th October, 1936, spoke of the foreign hand on Germany&apos;s throat, it was the English hand which he really had in mind. Three years ago it was a commonplace that war with England was unthinkable; to-day, the Nazi German is beginning to wonder whether it will not have to be faced, if Germany is to realise her destiny. General Goring implied as much at our farewell interview (my telegram No. 241, Saving, of the 13th April).&quot; 19. It is again dawning on the German consciousness that of all European countries perhaps the most inconvenient is Great Britain. The tradition of the balance of power, combined with the ruthless egotism of the English character and jealousy of German qualities, make it likely that England will not readily allow National-Socialist Germany to take the pre-dominant place in Europe which is her due. It is noted that Herr Hitler&apos;s repeatedly expressed desire for an understanding with England has been ignored; his voluntary limitation of the strength of the German navy has not produced the anticipated results. On the contrary, British policy bars the way to Germany in every direction. Germany&apos;s colonial demands are passed over; in the west the British Prime Minister declares the British frontier to be on the rhine; in the south-east the &apos; Anschluss &apos; with Austria [15679] B 2
has been consistently opposed, whilst in the east, where no British interest is involved, Great Britain declines to- give Germany a free hand or even to join the anti-Communist crusade. The same dog-in-the-manger policy is adopted in the case of Memel and Danzig. Wherever Germany attempts to recover what is hers or to extend her influence she is met with suspicion and covert or open opposition from England.&quot;6. If, therefore, I ask General Goring for concrete cases he can assuredly be counted upon to mention the Anschluss, the German colonies, Danzig, Memel, the &apos;&apos; East&apos;&apos; generally, export markets and the lack of British response to Hitler&apos;s various gestures. He will probably add to this list, already supplied by Sir E. Phipps, Spain, communism, the British press, the Sudetendeutsche, &amp;c.7. Most of these &apos;&apos; grievances &apos;&apos; were already enumerated by him at my interview with him on the 24th May, as well as at Lord Lothian&apos;s earlier in the month. He will wonder why I am asking for their repetition and he may well, moreover, conceive the hope that my call on him indicates a change of attitude in respect of them, which His Majesty&apos;s Government may be unwilling to con-template.8. I would submit, therefore, that the object which you contemplate in the last sentence of your despatch under reply would be better served if, before seeing General Goring, I could be put in a position to explain to him the standpoint of His Majesty&apos;s Government on each of the grievances which he mentioned to me before and which to all intents and purposes are those given in paragraph 6 above.9. I would add that while I have been careful to do little more than to generalise myself, my own attitude in these matters, both to General Goring and others, has hitherto been on the following lines : the grievances are imaginary; what the Germans take for obstruction is our insistence on peace and peaceful evolution; that French security is British security and vice versa and that no understanding is possible that does not include all three countries; that even if we recognise in principle Germany&apos;s colonial aspirations, nothing is more difficult than to satisfy them in practice; and that, as regards raw materials, His Majesty&apos;s Government would probably be very willing to discuss this problem with Germany if the latter desired to do so.I have, &amp;c.NEVILE HENDERSON.No. 4.Mr. Eden to Sir N. Henderson (Berlin).(No. 905.)Sir, Foreign Office, July 15, 1937.I HAVE received your Exeellency&apos;s despatch No. 551 of the 8th June, and I appreciate the reasons which have caused you to hesitate before carrying out the instructions conveyed to you in my despatch No. 687 of the 4th June, in which I desired you to seek another interview with General Goring and to invite him to explain more frankly the grounds on which the German people continue to regard England as the enemy in their path.2. I still consider it important that this attitude on the part of Germans should not be allowed to pass unchallenged; the longer they continue to nurse what I believe to be largely imaginary grievances, the deeper will their resentment become. I had intended to ventilate with Baron von Neurath the question of German grievances against this country, but as the prospect of a visit from Baron von Neurath has now receded, I am anxious that you should broach the matter with General Goring, who has himself repeated and endorsed the general accusations against the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government.3. I hope it may not be necessary to have an acrimonious discussion with the general;.I should desire a frank exchange of views, not for the sake of dialectics, but in the hope that, if these questions are ventilated in a frank and dispassionate manner, it may be possible thereby to dissipate certain misunderstandings and to
dispose the German Government to believe that, though the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government may be guided by certain principles with which the German Govern-ment are not in sympathy, it is not inspired by deliberate or unreasoning hostility to Germany.4. It is true, as you suggest in your despatch, that when you ask General Goring to support the statements he has made, he may be expected to recite a long list of subjects, among others those mentioned in paragraph 6 of your despatch, as regards which it may be commonly believed in Germany that there is a legitimate grievance against us. But a bare list of subjects would add little, if anything, to what we already know, and would merely be another way of generalising. What you should try to obtain from General Goring is : first, an exact, definition of the object of Germany&apos;s policy on each of the matters which he may mention; and secondly, a precise statement of the way in which, and of the occasions on which, in his view, the action and policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government have prevented or are preventing the German Government from attaining their objective. Unless the German Government define with clarity what they are aiming at and indicate in what manner they think His Majesty&apos;s Government are obstructing the attain-ment of their legitimate objectives, they are not entitled to make these accusations against us.5. Before, therefore, explaining the standpoint of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, as suggested in paragraph 8 of your Excellency&apos;s despatch, it is reasonable and necessary that General Goring should first elaborate his complaints with at any rate sufficient precision to enable His Majesty&apos;s Government to know with what they are charged. If, however, General Goring declined to define his grievances, then the answer which you have till now returned to this kind of generalisation and which you have set down in paragraph 9 of your despatch is clearly all that is possible and indeed desirable in the circumstances. But I hold strongly that the repetition of these generalisations is damaging to Anglo-German relations and can only lead to future misunderstandings and continued mutual resentment. It is for this reason that I desire you to renew your efforts to obtain such clarifications as will enable both Governments to appreciate the nature and extent of their differences at any rate those which are tangible and political, as distinct from those which are psychological and the result of forces beyond the control of statesmen.6. I shall be glad, therefore, if you will approach General Goring with an invitation to discuss the points on which he may think that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment offer unreasonable opposition to the realisation of legitimate German aims. Even though such a discussion may not lead to a settlement or adjustment of the matters at issue, I cannot help feeling that an exchange of views may clear the air and show in which direction a settlement might be sought.7. It would be well at an early stage in the conversation to remind General Goring that this country is still a member of the League of Nations and is pledged to fulfil the League Covenant so far as lies in its power, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government, therefore, could not contemplate with detachment any forcible disturbance in the status quo. This is not to say that His Majesty&apos;s Government are opposed to any discussion of change, for which, in point of fact, provision is also made in the Covenant. That changes, and even changes of great importance, can take place as a result of peaceful discussion has been repeatedly shown by recent experience. As evidence of this it is only necessary to quote the two Montreux conferences, the settlement of the Alexandretta question between France and Turkey, the release of Belgium from certain obligations in April, and the Anglo-German Naval Agreement itself.8. For your own guidance and for such use as you may find desirable, according to the manner in which the conversation develops, I will now furnish you with some basic arguments in respect of the various points enumerated in paragraph 6 of your despatch. I repeat that I am not seeking an acrimonious discussion with General Goring. I should be prepared to examine with interest and all possible sympathy what may be said on the German side in respect of each of these points. I am only afraid that if the case of the other side is allowed to go by default the German grievances may become magnified in German eyes and that they may fall into the error, of which they accuse us, of not taking into account the legitimate aspirations and sense of national pride of the other party.
9. As regards the &quot; Anschluss,&quot; it is evident that His Majesty&apos;s Government could not condone any change in the international status of Austria achieved by force against the will of the inhabitants. Even General Goring could hardly maintain that this is an unreasonable attitude. If he should ask what the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government would be in the event of a change of feeling in Austria, you might say that while you do not feel bound to answer such a hypothetical question, it is clear that in that event a new situation would have arisen which would affect the European equilibrium and as such would be of the utmost interest to all Governments concerned in the maintenance of European peace. Meanwhile, it does not appear that the majority of the Austrian people desire any change in the international status of Austria, but it would perhaps be unwise to stress this point, unless you are satisfied that General Goring will not contradict such a statement and try and force you into position of agreeing that a plebiscite is necessary and desirable in order to put the matter to the test.10. As regards the problem of the Sudetendeutschen minority in Czecho-slovakia, His Majesty&apos;s Government, far from standing in the way of Germany&apos;s wish to see the interests of this minority safeguarded, are, as a signatory of the Minorities Treaty and as a member of the League, anxious that any reasonable grievances of the Sudetendeutschen should be removed, in so far as this may be done by methods consistent with Czechoslovak sovereignty. They have, in fact, already used their influence in Prague to this end, and will continue to watch the situation carefully. His Majesty&apos;s Government could not, however, condone any forcible interference in the internal affairs of Czechoslovakia.11. The list, of subjects given in paragraph 6 of your despatch does not include the question of Germany&apos;s interests in the Danubian Basin as distinct from Austria and Czechoslovakia. Should General Goring mention these interests, you could enforce your point that so long as Germany&apos;s objectives are entirely undefined and Germany&apos;s grievances entirely unspecified, it. is impossible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to answer the charge of standing in Germany^ way. As I explained in my speech in the House of Commons on the 25th June, His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot, even if they would, disinterest themselves in the course of events in this part of the world, any more than they can disinterest themselves in the course of events anywhere else on the earth&apos;s surface, as con-ditions are to-day. This is bound to be the case, inasmuch as the Danubian States are League members with Great Britain, and because any mishandling of the problems of Central Europe would undoubtedly endanger the peace of Europe as a whole. For this latter reason His Majesty&apos;s Government must needs sympathise with any efforts the Danubian States may make to collaborate together for the maintenance of peace and the increase of their mutual well-being. But this does not mean in any way that His Majesty&apos;s Government wish to deny that Germany and Italy have important economic interests in Central Europe which they naturally wish to preserve and foster.12. To turn to Danzig and Memel, so far as His Majesty&apos;s Government are aware, the German Government have not hitherto put forward any concrete proposals for consideration. But in any event, any change in the existing position, if such is necessary, must in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government be a negotiated change, and His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot be said to be opposing German interests because they maintain their opposition to any alteration in the existing position by unilateral action or by forcible means. In view of the present situation at Danzig, you might add that His Majesty&apos;s Government are anxious that the Danzig question should not give rise to an international crisis, with damaging consequences to Anglo-German relations. It is important, therefore, that further developments should be by way of evolution rather than of revolution. The Danzig question arouses close interest in political circles in this country, and if there were untoward developments the effect on British opinion would be&quot; serious. There is no truth in the assertion that His Majesty&apos;s Government or the League Council are standing in the way of progress. There would be no unreasonable opposition on their part so long as the evolution proceeded on constitutional lines and in a moderate and reasonable spirit.13. When you speak of the question of the East generally, I take it that you contemplate that General Goring may argue (to quote your predecessors despatch No. 358) that &quot;in the East, where no British interest is involved, Great Britain
declines to give Germany a free hand or even to join the anti-Communist crusade.&quot; In that case I am bound to suppose that the problem of the East and the problem of communism are in German eyes one and the same. What the German Govern-ment complain of is that His Majesty&apos;s Government continue to co-operate with the Soviet Government in European affairs; whereas Germany would like to see the Soviet Government completely isolated. This, I fear, raises a fundamental issue on which His Majesty&apos;s Government have made their position quite clear and on which they cannot compromise. His Majesty&apos;s Government must take the Soviet Government as they find them in the conduct of international affairs, nor refuse co-operation, if its offer appears to be genuinely made, simply on account of divergence of political creed, and they cannot join any combination against the Soviet Government on the ground that the Soviet Government is a Communist Government and as such ought to be boycotted. I have made it abundantly plain that His Majesty&apos;s Governments policy precludes them from joining any &quot; ideo-logical bloc,&quot; but I must protest that this policy is in no way directed against German interests. Our decision not to treat communism as the common enemy has not been taken in any spirit of hostility to Germany or to nazism, nor can His Majesty&apos;s Government agree that it represents a determination on their part to obstruct the interests of Germany in the East.14. As regards the colonial question, General Goring has himself recognised that this point is not a matter of immediate importance, while in Herr Hitler&apos;s plan of March 1936 it occupied a subsidiary place, and was only to be discussed after the settlement of a number of far more urgent matters. You should avoid any reference to Dr. Schachfs conversations on this subject with French Ministers and with Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, unless General Goring mentions them. In the latter event, you might say that you understand the view of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment and of the French Government to be that the colonial question could not be considered unless and until agreement had been reached in principle on all the other elements which must go to make up a general settlement, and that Dr. Schacht was made aware of this view in Paris in May. If General Goring should ask your views about the nature of such a general settlement, you should avoid any detailed discussion and should confine yourself to suggesting that once the precise character of Germany&apos;s so-called grievances was known, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be in a better position to consider on what lines a general settlement should be based.15. If he should complain of the treatment accorded to German trade in British colonies and in territories under United Kingdom mandate, he can be assured that in every British colony Germany is permitted to trade on no less favourable terms than any other foreign country, and that in territories under United Kingdom mandate, German trade is still accorded equal treatment, although, since Germany is no longer a member of the League of Nations, she is not now entitled to claim it.16. As regards the question of export markets, I can offer no comment until I learn how General Goring may develop his complaints on this point.17. If General Goring should allege as a grievance the lack of response on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the Chancellors various offers, it would be fair to point out to him that the Anglo-German Naval Agreement affords the best possible proof of the readiness of His Majesty&apos;s Government to respond to a genuine initiative on the part of the German Government. The fact that so little progress has been made on other matters referred to by the Chancellor from time to time is not attributable to His Majesty&apos;s Government any more than to any other Government, including the German Government itself; indeed, no Govern-ment has made more strenuous efforts than His Majesty&apos;s Government to bring to fruition the various proposals made to restore the situation created by the repudiation of the Locarno Treaty in March 1936, and in particular, to make possible the negotiation of a security pact for Western Europe. I doubt whether it would be profitable to pursue this theme very far; what we want to do is less to review the past than to discover what Germany thinks ought to happen in the future.18. As to Spain and the British press, I feel sure that your Excellency will be able to meet anything that General Goring may say without further guidance from me.
19. I am content to leave it to you to choose the most suitable moment for opening your conversation with General Goring, though it would be well that it should, if possible, take place at a fairly early date. I must also leave the conduct of the conversation to your Excellency&apos;s discretion, though I hope, as I have indicated, that it may be possible to avoid a controversial form and to give it the turn, which I should like it to have, of endeavouring to remove misconceptions and of seeking to find the direction in which we might progress towards the remedy of legitimate grievances. Your object will be to convince the general, if he is at all open to reason, that His Majesty&apos;s Government have not to their knowledge adopted a policy hostile to Germany&apos;s legitimate interests; that they are only seeking to elucidate Germany&apos;s grievances in order that they may, where these are shown to exist, i try to find a remedy by friendly discussion with the German Government; and to persuade him to exercise his great influence to further the cause of Anglo-German understanding and co-operation, which he professes to have so much at heart.I am, &amp;c.ANTHONY EDEN.No. 5.Sir N. Henderson to Mr. Eden. (Received Jidy 22.)(No. 678.)Sir, Berlin, July 20, 1937.GENERAL GORING was absent in Munich when I received your despatch No. 905 of the 15th July instructing me to seek an interview with him and to invite him to explain frankly and fully his reasons for stating on a previous occasion that the German people, however reluctantly, had come to regard England as the enemy in Germany&apos;s path. I caused, however, a message to be sent to him at Munich requesting him if possible to receive me before the 21st of this month when I proposed to go to Marienbad for a cure. General Goring received me this morning at his country place about an hour and a half from Berlin.2. I began by telling the general that I wished to have a perfectly frank and friendly discussion with him and that it would simplify matters if he allowed me to read and leave with him a brief statement explaining as succinctly as possible the object of my visit. I accordingly read to him a German translation of the accompanying note, the gist of which was that I requested him to furnish me, firstly, with a definition of Germany&apos;s policy in respect of any particular points, and, secondly, with a precise enumeration as to the manner in which and the occasions on which, in his opinion, the action and policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government had prevented or was preventing the German Government from attaining their objectives. I added that there were certain . psychological differences, such as the recency of the Great War and our membership of the League of Nations which must inevitably come between us. It was not these which I particularly wished to discuss, but rather the specific tangible and political differences which had apparently led him to hold the view that it was England which was hemming Germany in and which was opposed in principle to every German aspiration, however legitimate. That was not a correct reading of the position, but correct or incorrect it could only lead to disaster. I was authorised to tell him that His Majesty&apos;s Government had never to their know-ledge adopted a policy hostile to Germany&apos;s legitimate interests. They wished on that account to know where Germany imagined that they had, and they hoped by friendly discussion to find a remedy for misunderstandings in this respect. I had not come to ask for generalisations but for facts. Incidentally I could mention to him quite a number of cases where Britain since the war had shown a considerable sense of comprehension of Germany&apos;s standpoint. In this connexion I quoted His Majesty&apos;s Governments opposition during the Versailles negotiations to the idea of a French Rhineland as well as to that of an independent Bavaria, the fairness both of the British occupation in the Ruhr and in the post-war plebiscite, as well as in reparation matters and in Britain&apos;s intervention at the time of the reoccupation of the Rhineland.
3. The conversation which followed this statement was not very enlighten-ing either as regards Germany&apos;s definite ambitions or as regards specific cases in which England had shown herself hostile to Germany&apos;s aspirations. It. was, said General Goring, difficult for any country to say openly in advance what its ultimate ambitions were. He undertook, however, to study carefully the note I left with him, and to endeavour to compile an answer in chapter and verse on the points I had raised.4. Otherwise the discussion was mostly on general lines. As I had begun with the League of Nations General Goring&apos;s first comment was also on that subject. Britain&apos;s connexion with the League blinded her to realities (Realpolitik). She was at the mercy of catchwords. Her identification with the League made her oblivious to the dangers of Germany&apos;s situation and to her real difficulty in finding outlets and food for her population, j Germany had been placed by fate in the centre of Europe; she had to be militarily strong, and now that she had abandoned all idea of expansion in the west (he would not lift a finger to get back Alsace-Lorraine, half-French as those provinces were) she had to look eastwards. The Slavs were her natural enemies and that was why Germany had adopted the attitude she had towards the war in Spain. Germany could not afford to have Bolshevists in power at that end of Europe. From Spain their influence would spread to France and Germany would find herself in the intolerable position of being surrounded by countries taking their cue from Moscow.   That, he said, was again a point England failed to understand.5. Austria was another example. If there were a plebiscite there to-morrow, 80 per cent, of the people would vote for Germany. It was not because they loved the Nazi regime but because every German, when it was a matter of Germany, voted German. It was on that point that Hitler had proved himself so right and which accounted for his overwhelming success in Germany itself even in his early beginnings. It had not been a question of Hitler but of Germany. The Austrian Government had not the courage even to permit a plebiscite because they knew that the Austrian people would not vote for them. Yet, if the German Government did persuade the Austrian Government, as they were constantly urging the latter to do, to agree to a plebiscite, the British Government would rise up and say no.6. I intervened at this stage with the observation that while I could not share his views as to the present wishes of the majority of the Austrian people, I should have thought it in any case a great mistake on the part of the German Government to precipitate. Patience was the greatest virtue of statesmen and, right or wrong as his estimate might be, it was in all circumstances impolitic to try and force the pace. It seemed to me that Germany above all other countries required peace and a long period of tranquillity. Looking at Germany&apos;s situation quite objectively I was able to appreciate certain great qualities of the Nazi regime. It had reduced unemployment from 6 million to 600,000; it had abolished class distinctions, and much of its social programme was highly progressive. Certain of its spiritual qualities, such as its teaching of the dignity of labour and the moral value of service, were also admirable. But time was required to lay solid foundations for Germany&apos;s new experiment. I could not believe that Hitler desired to risk all his work on the chance of war.7. To this Goring replied that I could set my mind at ease; there would be no more surprises for several years. At the same time, what was peaceful evolution ? There were three and a half million Germans in Czechoslovakia. Would the latter ever give them up without a struggle and Germany could not eternally listen unmoved to their complaints ? Great Britain might use her influence at Prague or in the League, but did any result ever come out of such intervention ? Nothing : it had been the same in the Rhineland where Germany had eventually to act on her own.8. His Majesty&apos;s Government, he continued, might preach peaceful evolu-tion and be opposed to possible interference; yet Germany also had the right to live and Austria and the Sudetendeutsche were not vital questions for her as they were for Germany. France might desire to oppose the development of Germany, but there was nothing in Germany&apos;s greatness which was contrary to British interests. Germany was willing to recognise British preponderance on [15679] ^ c
the sea which was vital to her. If there were a real Anglo-German under-standing, Germany would; not even. worry about colonies, even if England added to her present Empire. Hitler had clearly indicated in Mein Kampf how earnestly he desired England&apos;s friendship. He was bitterly disappointed and resentful at England&apos;s unwillingness to reciprocate. It was, Goring assured me, the bitterest experience of Hitler&apos;s life. Nor could he, Goring, understand it, German soldiers such as Field-Marshal von Blomberg, German airmen, German sailors, all told him how friendly disposed the British military forces were towards Germany. The British public, if the reports which reached him were correct, was equally so. It was only the British Government and the British politician who were so hostile. Two months ago he had himself felt that there was only one course open to Germany, namely, to make herself so overwhelmingly strong that she would be certain of victory if she had all the world against her again. Now he was prepared once again to hope in the possibility of that Anglo-German understanding which he himself, but Hitler more than anyone else, believed to be in the truest interests of both countries.9. The above report, though it has had to my regret to be compiled in haste to catch the bag to-morrow and on the eve of my own departure, represents fairly accurately the course of our conversation which was conducted throughout perfectly amicably, though with some feeling at times on General Goring&apos;s part. Most of my own remarks were on the lines indicated in your despatch under reply. As you will have seen, the discussion produced nothing very definite and precise to justify German grievances or to throw fresh light on German aims. But I did not in fact anticipate that it would, since it was obvious that the points on which I sought enlightenment were such as to require reflection before replying. It was on that account that I left the written document which I enclose and a step forward will certainly have been achieved if I get the answer thereto which General Goring led me to expect and which was the object of the note.10. I should add that the general began by making it quite clear that he was speaking personally inasmuch as all final decisions and views on policy rested with Hitler himself. Since he will certainly consult the latter as the result of my interview, the subsequent reply which I may receive should have all the greater value.I have, &amp;c.NEVILE HENDERSON.Enclosure in No. 5. Note left tvith General Goring by Sir N. Henderson.Herr Minister President, Berlin, July 19, 1937.ON the occasion of the first interview which I had the honour to have with your Excellency, you laid stress on the impression which was beginning to be felt by the German people that England was the enemy in its path. I informed His Majesty&apos;s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of your remarks to this effect. Mr. Eden had hoped to discuss this point with Baron von Neurath on the occasion of his visit to London, but, since this has had to be postponed, he has requested me to see your Excellency in the hope that a frank and dispassionate discussion will both lead to the dissipation of certain misunderstandings in this respect and will dispose the German Government to believe that, though the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government may be guided by certain principles with which the German Government are not in sympathy, it is definitely not inspired by deliberate or unreasoning hostility to Germany.With this object in view I have come to ask whether your Excellency will be so good as to furnish mex firstly, with a definition of Germany&apos;s policy in any particular matter and, secondly, with a precise statement as to the manner in which and the occasions on which, in your view, the action and policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government have prevented, or are preventing, the German Government from attaining their objective.
Your Excellency will, in fact, realise that His Majesty&apos;s Government feel entitled, to know exactly what the charges against them are. Something more is required than mere generalisations, which can only prejudice in an increasing degree Anglo-German relations and lead to still greater future misunderstandings and mutual resentment.In making this request to your Excellency I wish for my part to emphasise that His Majesty&apos;s Government have not to their knowledge adopted a policy hostile to what are, in their opinion, Germany&apos;s legitimate interests and that they are most anxious to find a remedy for our joint problems by friendly discussion with the German Government.
