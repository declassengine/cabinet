COPY No.CP. No- 221/37oCABINET.Appreciation of the Political Situation, by the Government of India, dated 23rd September, 1937.Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential appreciation of the Political Situation in India,  dated the 23rd September, 1937, issued on the authority of the Secretary of State for India.1. North-West Frontier Province.    There has been little change in the Waziristan situation.    Sniping of camps and piquets by night and of troops moving about the country by day has continued,  but there has been no serious engagement. The Faqir of Ipi has been moving from place to place in Shawal, a valley in the mountainous country west of Razmak.    In the middle of August about 4 or 5,000 tribesmen collected in Shawal in the belief that, with the assistance of the Afghan authorities,  peace was about to be negotiated on terms favourable to themselves.    A rumour was spread that the Government intended to evacuate the whole of Waziristan..    On August 16th a secret meeting was held by a few of the most important tribal leaders and a letter was despatched to the Afghan Government.    The tribesmen then dispersed on being given to understand that negotiations would be resumed in 2 or 3 weeks time.    Small parties are again beginning to collect round the Faqir in Shawal. Government&apos;s terms, which included a fine of Rs.40,000,  and 1,020 rifles, were announced to the Mahsuds in the latter half of August, and accepted. All the rifles demanded have already been surrendered.    In spite of this a&apos;religious leader,  called Mullah Sher Ali, has raised a following of 300 Mahsuds in the Upper Baddar Valley, and early in September attacked and looted some Khassadar posts on the Razmak-vfana Road.    Operations are about to be undertaken against him.    Work on the new roads in Shaktu and its vicinity is proceeding satisfactorily.    Some serious raids have taken place in the Dera Ismail Khan District,  and a number of Hindus have been kidnapped.    The Bhitannis were responsible for 2 of these raids, and a portion of their country is being bombed
(after due warning) in order to secure the return of the kidnapped Hindus.2. Congress Ministries.    The number of these hasincreased from 6 to 7 (out of&apos;11 Governor1s provinces) by the recent fall of the Ministry in the North-West Frontier Province.    The beginning of the budget session of the Legislature saw the defeat of a Ministry which had. from its inception, little security or confidence.    The new Ministry is predominantly Congress, but in a legislature made up of small and factious parties it was necessary for Congress to obtain converts and,  in effect,  the arrangement is a coalition.    This denotes a change in the policy of the Congress Central Command and there may be repercussions in other provinces where Congress at present have not an absolute majority in the Legislatures. .3. Provincial Legislatures.    In most of the provincesbudget sessions have been going on.    The budgets in Congress provinces have had to be hastily prepared as the Ministries were formed so late;    and in all the provinces they are only for the remaining half of the financial year.In Assam the non-Congress Ministry suffered a number of defeats, and the rejection of grants for the temp-temporary staff of the Criminal Investigation Department and for the staffs of Divisional Commissioners may cause embarrassment. In other provinces the Ministries have had little difficulty in carrying through their budget proposals unscathed.    Some of the budgets show deficits, in part due to the redemption of election promises to reduce Government dues.    &quot;Prohibition&quot;, as an ideal to be achieved in the near future, has been enjoined by the Congress high command, but there is a tendency
to regard it as an unfortunate expensive hobby of Mr. Gandhi.    It is likely to be seriously initiated in one province (Madras), where the experiment will begin in one district on October 1st and has behind it the enthusiasm of the Chief Minister who belongs to that district.It is too early to judge the financial policy of the newly formed ministries;    in a few months all Provincial Governments wili.be framing budgets for their first complete year, and are then likely to find the dilemma acute between financing promised reforms and satisfying a populace which has been assiduously taught that, especially in land-tax, they have been excessively burdened.    Conditions on the land are likely to be a serious embarrassment also in those Congress provinces where &quot;peasants&quot; and landless labourers are claiming full promises of relief from their conditions of tenure or employment under the land-holding classes.Provinces have floated large loans in the open market;    and the immediate over-subscription of them indicates that public confidence is not impaired.4. Congress and Central control.    At present,although there are not lacking signs that Ministries find the control of the Central Committee irksome, that control is still loyally accepted.    It undoubtedly holds in check the powerful Left-Wing Party, but the vigour of this wing, combined with the natural desire of the Ministries to wipe off the slate unpopular traces of the old regime, has produced some disquieting results.The Congress President, free of ministerial and legislative responsibility, has not ceased to
emphasise the need for local Congress organisation outside the legislatures and increased activity in the villages,  and there have been signs of attempts to set up an organisation parallel to the Government established by law which, especially in his own province (United Provinces), have genuinely embarrassed the Ministry.    Again, the cleaning of the slate as regards &quot;political&quot; prisoners and persons under detention or restriction and illegal associations has been accompanied by unedifying incidents amounting in places to demonstrations of approval,  even of persons guilty of serious violence.    Here again, however, the Ministries have generally tried to make it clear that they themselves can have no sympathy with disorder.In the industrial field there are signs - the Cawnpore situation mentioned below is the most serious -that Ministries may, before long, have to choose between grave disturbance and action not unlike what used to be condemned as repression.5. Congress and the Services.      Suspicion ofMinistries towards the services,  of which there were signs at first, has dissolved and a number of Ministers have paid notable tributes to their cordial co-operation.     The appeal for   a &quot;voluntary cut&quot; in pay - mentioned in the last appreciation - has died a natural death.      There is still talk in some provinces, translated into prospective action in the budgets, of reduction of pay (for new entrants) and of allowances such as travelling allowances, but the motive for this is economy rather than hostility to the services.The main danger to the morale and interests of the services comes from the activities of the local organisations mentioned above which, in the name of the Congress, set up bureaux where complaints against officials are received and
propagated.6. &quot;Political&quot; prisoners.    The hunger-strike inthe Andemans,  of which mention was made in the last appreciations  after lasting for over 5 weeks - and on the part ox 8 of the leaders for s fortnight longer -has been discontinued.    Mr. Gandhi timed an appeal to the prisoners for its discontinuance so opportunely that he has acquired credit for it though more properly that credit belongs in part to the firm attitude of the Central and Bengal Governments and in part to appeals from extremist &quot;comrades&quot; outside.    The Bengal Government is particularly entitled to congratulation, for in that province (from which the greet majority of the prisoners come)  a dangerously hysterical agitation developed end the ministerial stand against coercion was as courageous as it has proved successful.Two reflections mitigate satisfaction in the /termination without casualties of this hunger-strike and sympathetic strikes started in other -jails.    One is that this method of intimidation,  of which,  as a political weapon, Mr. Gandhi himself has boon a distinguished exponent, has very likely come to stay.The other is that the more determined prisoners have not abandoned their original demands, which include the release of all &quot;political&quot; prisoners end the repeal of all &quot;repressive&quot; laws,  end Mr. Gandhi has pledged himself to work for these ends. 7. labour.    Organised agitation,  exploiting what may or may not be genuine grievances, has increased in Some provinces, while at Cawnpore a serious situation has arisen.    In the last appreciation, mention
was made of a settlement effected through the intervention of the Premier of the United Provinces. The settlement was short-lived end widespread strikes have begun again, not unaccompanied by violence.    A committee, representing both employers and labour under a Congress leader as chairman, has been appointed, but it is doubtful whether, oven If a settlement is   -reached, the unions can control their members.At tho. moment the Committee&apos;s labours scorn to have failed.    The situation will prove a searching tost of the government&apos;s ability both to preserve order and to influence extremist labour agitation.    Tho theory that terrorism is dead has boon much -advertised lately, for instance, the Andamans hunger-strikers have abjured terrorism, but there is some reason to suppose that armed revolution as tho ultimate aim and a general strike as the more proximate aim in labour centres are now the objective of those forces which used to favour terrorism.8. Communal trouble.    After j:  comparativelypeaceful month it is unfortunately necessary to report a recrudescence of communal trouble.    Sporadic affrays between Hindus and MohamCdsns have occurred in Madras city and minor incidents have occurred in other provinces.    In the Punjab the situation has shown no signs of improvement and the tone of the communal press has deteriorated.The Punjab Government regard the situation with grave concern and have set up a committee to examine it. Tho Premier has issued warnings that attempts to foster communal strife will be put down with the utmost rigour .A curious agitation has lately and suddenly arisen
in the Punjab over a proposal to set up a centre! abattoir for supplying the army in India with meat. Eversr quarter from which objection could be anticipated was consulted beforehand end no opposition was expected.    But at a later stage vehement propaganda, probably started by persons financially interested, arose without warning end in view of the danger that might result from a controversy which rapidly developed on communel lines the Government of India have been forced to abandon the scheme at a cost to the tax-pryar of a sum which may amount to 50 lakhs of rupees. 9. The monsoon.    The monsoonupoia.&apos;.wh.i.ch.&apos;-cultivation iilorgely dependent has been very unevenly distributed throughout India.    Generally speaking in the --east .o.f the country there has been excessive rain and some danger of flooding.    In northern India, however, there has been drought which has caused serious anxiety. 10.       Palestine affairs.   Numerous meetings have been held end resolutions passed throughout the country condemning the recommendations of the Roycl Commission.&apos; Hindu support of the agitation is politically interested but Moslem objections to the scheme, though by no means general,  are sincere and increasing in volume. &quot;Palestine Day&quot; was celebrated in some places on a fairly large scale end in a few places extremists seized the opportunity to create disturbances. 11.       The far eastern situation.    Two battalions of Indian troops have been sent to Hong Song to protect Indian interests.    Their despatch, which has received the approval of the right wing of the Congress party, has been severely criticised by the left wing as an imperial move.
12.       Central legislature.    The central Assembly has been in session since 23rd August.    The main item of government business has been&apos; a Bill designed to regulate insurance business in Indie.,  en elaborate measure comparable in its importance to business interests with the Companies Act which was carried last year.    The Congress end quasi-Congrcss parties abstained from attendance when the Viceroy addressed both chambers on September 13th, but proceedings have been on the whole serious and restrained.Egsolutions have been carried condemning the &quot;callous attitude&quot; of the Government to the Andaman hunger-strike and demanding a reduction in, expenditure of the Central Government (particularly on the Army) in order that more money might be placed at the disposal of the Provincial Governments;    but one condemning the Government policy in the Zanzibar clove controversy was lost.    Discussion on a resolution sponsored, by the Congress Party condemning the Government of India Act and demanding the formulation of a new constitution through a &quot;constituent Assembly&quot; is proceeding:    resolutions in similar terms&apos; have, under orders from the Congress Centre, been moved end. passed in Congress Provincial Assemblies but in the Central Assembly the terms of the motion have come in for strong criticism,  particularly from Mohamedan members.
