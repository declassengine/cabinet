THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1937.SECRET. Copy -No.CP. 224 (37).CABINET.CLOSER UNION BETWEEN SOUTHERN RHODESIA, NORTHERN RHODESIA AND NYASALAND.Joint Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and the Secretary of State for the ColoniesIT will be recalled that at their meeting on the 21st July, Cabinet 31 (37) (Conclusion 7), the Cabinet again considered the question of closer union between Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, and approved the proposals contained in our Joint Memorandum CP. 187 (37), including the following documents attached thereto :-(1) The draft of a letter to the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia. (2) The Terms of Reference to the Commission (if it should be decided to appoint one), together with an explanatory statement.It was also decided that, in the event of agreement to appoint a Commission, the question of its personnel should be brought before the Cabinet.2. The text of the letter as sent to the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia is appended (Appendix I), and Mr. Huggins&apos;s letter in reply is reproduced as Appendix II.The letter to Mr. Huggins stated (1) that the view of the United Kingdom Government was that amalgamation of the territories could not be regarded as practical politics at the present time;(2) that His Majesty&apos;s Government were ready to examine the possibility of extending co-operation and association between the territories concerned;(3) that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be glad to know whether Mr. Huggins would prefer that the examination should be made in consultation between the three African Governments concerned or by a Royal Commission sent from this country.It will be seen that in his letter of the 23rd August (Appendix II)r Mr: Huggins explains that, while he would welcome the appointment of a Commission, he could not agree to the proposal that the Commission should be tied down by instructions not to report on the question of the advisability of amalgamation. Such a Commission would be a &quot; political embarrassment&apos;&apos; to his Government. He has accordingly suggested certain amendments in the draft statement and the draft Terms of Reference designed to ensure that the question of amalgamation should not be excluded. The amendments in themselves are only slight and could perhaps be accepted in any event, but it will be appreciated that the vital consideration is whether or not any Commission that may be sent out should be appointed on the basis that it is definitely barred from reporting on the question of amalgamation.[15909] b
3. In our first memorandum, circulated to the Cabinet on the 8th May last ((CP. 137 (37)), it was pointed out that, while there were reasons for adhering to the decision of 1931, there were &quot; Factors which favoured a decision to investigate some form of union or closer association. It would probably be welcomed by a considerable part of the people of Southern Rhodesia who, as has been pointed out above, are very loyal to the British connection, and will also help to avoid the further development among the settlers of Northern Rhodesia of an &apos; anti-Whitehall complex.&apos; A full investigation should, at any rate, provide material for further consideration, and the advocates of union would feel that they had been fully heard.&quot;In the course of the discussion at the Cabinet on the 26th May (C. 22 (37)), it was pointed out that if a decision should eventually be taken to encourage anything in the nature of amalgamation, it would be necessary to secure the interests of the natives for whom His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom was in the position of a trustee, and that without a guarantee on this point it would be politically impossible to secure the acceptance of the proposal by Parliament. As explained in our subsequent memorandum (CP. 187 (37)), the view we arrived at after the discussions in London with Mr. Huggins and the Governors of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland was that while it might be possible to devise means of closer co-operation between Northern and Southern Rhodesia (and also, if necessary, Nyasaland) on many matters, enquiry into this should be on the strict understanding that there could be no question of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom modifying in any way the control which they exercise over native policy and administration in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. This condition, in effect, seemed to us to rule out the possibility of amalgamation between the three Territories on any terms compatible with the present status of Southern Rhodesia (see paragraph 27 of CP. 137 (37)), and we felt that if any Commission of Enquiry were appointed, the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom on this aspect of the matter should be made clear in a statement attached to the terms of reference.4. While we still feel that it will be necessary for His Majesty&apos;s Government to retain their present responsibilities in regard to the native inhabitants of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland and their limited powers regarding native affairs in Southern Rhodesia, there are considerations in favour of acquiescence in Mr. Huggins&apos;s proposal that the terms of reference should not definitely be of such a nature as to prevent a Commission considering the question of possible eventual amalgamation, viz. :-(a) As it would appear from Mr. Huggins&apos;s letter that he could not, for political reasons, concur in the appointment of a Commission with amalgamation in terms excluded, it would appear impossible to proceed with the appointment of any Commission at all unless his wishes in this respect could be met. This movement would be unfortunate, as the appointment of a Commission seems desirable in order to prevent, at least for the time being, the continuance of political agitation on the subject in the Rhodesias. This agitation is liable to create ill-will towards the Government in Whitehall by charging it with indifference to the pleas of the Rhodesians, a charge which could no longer be sustained if a Royal Commission were to go out free to listen to the case of the advocates of amalgamation. Moreover, it will be remembered that Sir Hubert Young reported after his return to Northern Rhodesia that the possibility of amalgamation was doing more than anything else to impede the progress of Northern Rhodesia, and that he would like to make it clear that there could be no question of amalgamation for 15 or 20 years or until the native inhabitants had expressed a wish for it. More recently, in a personal letter of the 6th July to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the Governor repeated his conviction that some finality must be reached if there is to be any progress in Northern Rhodesia, and expressed the hope that, in the event of His Majesty&apos;s Government deciding that amalgamation is not to be proceeded with now, it should be made clear that this decision would stand for a really substantial period of time. Sir Hubert Young has now received a copy of Mr. Huggins&apos;s letter of the 23rd August, and has expressed his personal agreement with the view that a Royal Commission would be an embarrassment if it were not authorised to
consider amalgamation. Sir Harold Kittermaster, the Governor of Nyasaland, has been consulted in this country and sees no objection to the acceptance of Mr. Huggins&apos;s proposal.(b) The Commission would presumably take evidence not only from those advocating amalgamation, but also from parties interested&apos; in maintaining intact the present control of the United Kingdom over native affairs in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. It would also consult, at any rate informally, those responsible for the administration of the two Territories.In view of this, and of the strong feeling in the House of Commons in favour of the maintenance of our existing responsibilities, it is inconceivable that a Commission on which the three political parties are to be represented would under-estimate the importance of this aspect of the matter.(c) On the other hand, a Commission which was able to survey the whole field would probably be able to make valuable recommendations regarding closer co-operation and association in various directions between the three administra-tions. We think that Mr. Huggins is probably right in suggesting that enquiry into this by consultation between the three Governments would yield less satisfactory results than enquiry by a Royal Commission.(d) Even if Mr. Huggins could be persuaded to accept our original proposal, it would in practice not be easy to prevent bodies in the three territories submitting to the Commission proposals for forms of closer association which might in fact amount practically to amalgamation, and the Commission might consequently find some difficulty in drawing a clear line between proposals which they could and could not consider.5. In all the circumstances, we recommend that Mr. Huggins&apos;s proposal as to the amendment of the terms of reference and explanatory statement should be accepted, though we propose that Mr. Huggins should be informed, at the same time, that while we are prepared to meet his wishes in this respect in order that the Commission may be free to review the whole position, this must not be regarded as meaning that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom see any likelihood of their being able to depart, at any rate in the near future, from their view as to the necessity of maintaining their present responsibility in relation to native policy in each of the Territories concerned.If this proposal is approved we will proceed with the necessary communica-tions to the Governments of Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland1.6. As indicated in the letter to Mr. Huggins of the 28th July (Appendix I), it is proposed that the Commission might suitably consist of, say, five persons, of whom three would be Members of Parliament representative of the principal parties, and we should also propose to take preliminary steps for the preparation of a list of possible names for approval by the Cabinet (see Cabinet Conclusion 31 (37) 7 (b)).The selection of the Members of Parliament representing the two Opposition Parties would, of course, have to be made in discussion with the Party Leaders. We feel it to be of real importance to follow the policy adopted in 1931 of keeping in touch with the Leaders of the Opposition Parties on this matter. Indeed, we think it desirable that they should continue to be consulted on each successive development of this question with the object of keeping it, so far as possible, out of the sphere of party politics.W&apos;. 0.&apos; G.Downing Street, September 30, 1937.APPENDIX I.(Confidential.)Dear Mr. Huggins, Downing Street, July 28, 1937.Mr. ORMSBY GORE and I undertook, when we discussed with you in London the general question of the closer association or co-operation of the Rhodesias and Nyasaland, to consider the matter further in consultation with our colleagues, and I promised that I would then communicate with you again on your return to Southern Rhodesia.[15909] B 2
We have now consulted the Cabinet accordingly, and as I think you will have expected from our talks in London, the view of the United Kingdom Govern-ment is that amalgamation of the Territories cannot be regarded as practical politics at the present time. The Government feel that they cannot contemplate the relinquishment of their responsibilities in regard to the native inhabitants of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland in their present stage of development, and, indeed, they are confident that any such action would be quite unacceptable to Parliament. At the same time we should be very ready, subject to the above condition, to examine the possibility of extending association or co-operation between the Territories in other matters and by other means. Such an investiga-tion need not necessarily exclude the possibility of closer&apos; association in the political sphere, though it must be admitted that any form of closer political association between a self-governing Colony and Territories in regard to which the Secretary of State for the Colonies would continue to have a special responsi-bility to Parliament would appear to be very difficult, if not impossible, to devise.When we discussed the matter with you in London the suggestion was put forward that a Commission might be appointed to advise as to how far the promotion and extension of such closer association or co-operation was desirable and feasible. It may be, of course, that if actual amalgamation is excluded from the scope of such a Commission, you may feel that the question is one the further examination of which could be adequately undertaken by the three Governments in consultation. If so, we should be very ready to consider any suggestions for such examination. If, on the other hand, you consider that it would be of value for a Commission to be sent from this country to report on the matter, we should be glad to make arrangements accordingly. In that case, we feel that it would be important to explain, in a statement attached to the actual terms of reference of any such Commission, the general object and scope of its work in order that it might be clear from the outset that amalgamation of the Territories was not in contemplation. I enclose a draft showing the kind of statement and terms of reference which we think might be suitable.I should be grateful for your views on the subject as soon as you have been able to consider the matter in consultation with your colleagues. If you should feel that there would be advantage to be gained by the appointment of a Commission from this country, we should be quite prepared, in accordance with the wish you expressed in London, to let you know, before setting up the Commission, whom we had in mind as its members. Our present view is that it might suitably consist of, say, five persons, of whom three would be Members of Parliament representative of the principal parties. It wrould hardly be practicable, I imagine, for a Commission to leave until after Christmas, and it would seem desirable that, before they present a report, they should have available the reports of the Economic Commissions which are proceeding to Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, and also Lord Hailey&apos;s report on his African survey. These reports should be available, I hope, early next year.I am writing to you semi-officially in this way in order that we may have an indication of your wishes before we send any official communication. We would propose to place our views on record later in an official despatch.Mr. Ormsby Gore is sending a copy of this letter to Sir Hubert Young and Sir Harold Kittermaster for their personal information, but he does not propose to take any further action as regards Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland until we have heard from you. A copy of this letter is being sent privately to Sir Herbert Stanley also for his information. If you should think it desirable to communicate with Sir Hubert Young before replying, we should have no objection.   Sir Harold Kittermaster is still in this country.MALCOLM MacDONALD.
Prime Ministers Office,Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia, Dear Mr. MacDonald, A ugust 23, 1937.THANK you for&quot; your letter of the 28th July. I note in your letter you state : &quot; The Government feel that they cannot contemplate the relinquishment of their responsibilities in regard, to the Native inhabitants of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland in their present stage of development, and, indeed, they are confident that any such action would be quite unacceptable to Parliament. At the same time we should be very ready, subject to the above condition, to examine the possibility of extending association or co-operation between the Territories in other matters and by other means. Such an investigation need not necessarily exclude the possibility of closer association in the political sphere, though it must be admitted that any form of closer political association between a self-governing Colony and Territories in regard to which the Secretary of State for the Colonies would continue to have a special responsibility to Parliament, would appear to be very difficult, if not impossible, to devise.&quot;If this means that the Commission may not report on the advisability of amalgamation, either soon or later, and the conditions required before amalgama-tion can take place under our present constitution, the Commission would be a political embarrassment out here.I think the visit of the Commission would be a great help to all concerned, and that we are not likely to make much progress by consultation between the three Governments, although I hope our Conferences will go on as before, but they are not likely to make much progress of a material nature. We require a common postal union, a customs union, common policy in connection with defence, transport, communications, scientific and technical research, as near as possible a common Native policy, including, of course, Native education, a common economic policy, and I cannot see agreement between a self-governing State and countries governed by the Colonial Office. Dictatorships can easily make agree-ments, but it is not so easy for self-governing States, who have to consider public opinion, and that brings me to the objection to a Commission that may not report on amalgamation.We have a General Election due in about September 1939, if nothing happens to precipitate one before that. I explained to you in London that I do not know what percentage of the voters here are in favour of amalgamation, and that there would be more in favour of amalgamation with Northern Rhodesia than there would be if Nyasaland were included. There are two other groups : one favours carrying on by ourselves, and the other favours union with South Africa, and the latter groups consider any closer union with Northern Rhodesia will postpone indefinitely what they want. Most of our Unionists are in my Party. I do not think the numbers are very large, but they could rouse the Dutch vote, and I know they are considering putting up candidates at the next election. To prevent an issue that was not practical politics until the Imperial Government changed its view from interfering with other matters at the election, I have promised that the question of Amalgamation with Northern Rhodesia should be referred to a referendum before the matter was settled.If a Commission is sent out to report on closer union and amalgamation is barred from the report, I have no clean-cut issue to propose or defend at the election such as union with South Africa would be in the hands of the opposition; further, they could state that I was proposing to get Southern Rhodesia and Northern Rhodesia so involved without a referendum that union with the South would become impossible in other words that I had &quot; diddled &quot; them out of the promised referendum by establishing indissoluble ties with the North, without consulting the people.I cannot see why the Imperial Government do not wish a report from an impartial Committee on this big question; there is no necessity to accept the report if it is contrary to the policy^of the United-Kingdom; in the same way,APPENDIX II.
if they reported that the only solution was amalgamation, I could not promise to accept it without a referendum out here. My colleagues and I wish to establish a British bloc in South Central Africa, and we are prepared to try and convince the people that it is the right course; unless that is done, there is a constant risk of our premature entrance into the Union, which would be a disaster for Southern Rhodesia and for British Africa as a whole.We would like and would welcome a Commission to report on the issue, but they must not be tied down to exclude amalgamation.If your memorandum were amended to read as amended by me, and no statement made that amalgamation could not be reported on, we would welcome a report from a Commission, but if that cannot be agreed to, the Commission would be very useful, but politically impossible, and we could not agree to it.I should be very much obliged if you would show this letter to the Prime Minister, as we feel that the aim of creating a British bloc in South Central Africa may be a matter on which the Imperial Government as a whole might like to express an opinion and encourage us or otherwise.Yours sincerely,G. MARTIN HUGGINS.The Right Hon. Malcolm MacDonald, M.P.Enclosure in Appendix II.Words in brackets to be omitted. Words in italic to be inserted.It will be recalled that in 1931 His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom had under consideration the question of the relationship between Southern and Northern Rhodesia. As announced in both Houses of Parliament on the 2nd July of that year, by the Secretaries of State for Dominion Affairs and for the Colonies, the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government at that time was that for some time to come Northern Rhodesia should continue to work out its own destiny as a separate entity, observing the closest possible co-ordination with its neighbours, and especially with Southern Rhodesia.In the course of the last few months, His Majesty&apos;s Government have had the opportunity of discussing with the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia, with the Governor and two unofficial members of the Legislative Council of Northern Rhodesia, and with the Governor of Nyasaland, the position as it has developed since the announcement of 1931 was made.As the result of these discussions, His Majesty&apos;s Government have reached the conclusion that (subject to the maintenance of) with due regard to their special responsibility (as it now stands in each of the three territories concerned) for the interests of the Native inhabitants consideration should be given in detail to the possibility of the further promotion of closer co-operation or association between Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Some of the subjects which suggest themselves immediately for examination are transport and communications, scientific and technical research and services, labour, especially the inter-territorial migration of labour, trade and economic policy, judicial arrangements, defence, and, so far as international obligations affecting the territories permit, customs duties.In accordance with the wishes of the Government of Southern Rhodesia, and after consultation with the Governors of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom propose to advise His Majesty to appoint a Royal Commission to visit the territories concerned. The terms of reference of the Commission will be as follows : To enquire and report whether any, and if so what form of closer co-opera-tion or association between Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland is desirable and feasible, with due regard to the interests of the European and Native inhabitants of the Territories concerned and to (the maintenance of) the special responsibility (as it now stands in each of the three Territories) of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom for the interests of the Native inhabitants.
