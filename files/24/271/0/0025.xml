Paper No. 257-A.)(Previous reference : OLD. Minutes of the 267th Meeting, Minute 2.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Report of a Sub-Conrmittee on Compensation to Civilians for Loss of Life or Injury from Air Attack (OLD. Paper No. 257-A).THE CHAIRMAN, in welcoming Mr. Craig to the Committee, thanked him for the very full report which had been prepared by the Sub-Committee under his Chairmanship, and asked him whether there was anything which he wished to add.Mr. CRAIG replied that he had nothing to add to the Report.SIR WARREN FISHER said that he had no observations to make, and suggested that there was nothing more to be done at present beyond carrying out the recommendation of the Sub-Committee, that consideration of the administra-tion of the scheme of compensation should be entrusted to the Ministry of Pensions.Mr. HORE-BELISHA, referring to the recommendation contained in paragraph 31 of the Report &quot; that adult male persons gainfully employed, in cases of total or partial disablement, and the widows and children of persons gainfully employed, in cases of death, should be compensated in accordance with the scale of awards recommended for non-Regular privates and their widows and children in the Report of the Pensions Committee,&quot; said that the War Office would view with considerable misgiving the compensation of civilians on the same scale as combatants.SIR WARREN FISHER pointed out that the views of the Sub-Committee regarding the compensation of civilians in comparison with members of the Defence Forces were contained in paragraph 13 of the Report, where it was stated that it was clear that to grant compensation to civilians at a greater rate than that generally available to the personnel of the Defence Forces would be wrong in principle and would create difficulties for the Government. Regarding Mr. Hore-Belisha&apos;s point as to whether civilians should receive less, he felt that the answer was that the dangers to which both civilians and soldiers would be exposed in the next war were now probably the same. Paragraph 6 of the Report pointed out that civilian casualties in the first 6-8 weeks of the war might amount to 30,000 a day, of which 10,000 would be deaths and 20,000 injuries. On this estimate he doubted whether the Expeditionary Force would suffer even the same measure of casualties.Mr. HORE-BELISHA suggested that the analogy was not entirely fair. The soldier engaged to be killed, and only received compensation attributable to such engagement.    The civilian, moreover, did not suffer the same rigours off 15617-4]
2service as the soldier. He therefore suggested that the question of whether the scale of compensation for civilians should be the same as that for the non-Regular private (as recommended in the Report), or whether it should be on a lower scale, should be discussed departmentally.SIR SAMUEL HOARE felt that the scheme of compensation suggested was a national obligation and that everybody &quot;gainfully employed&quot; should be included in it. He considered that the flat rate recommended in the Report should be accepted in principle, the only outstanding question being the actual amount.THE CHAIRMAN referred to the recommendation in paragraph 26 of the Report that persons engaged as volunteers on war work should be covered by the scheme, and asked whether it was the intention that these people should be compensated on the same basis as those gainfully employed.Mr. CRAIG replied that during the last war people had, in fact, worked as volunteers in Government Departments, and on other war services, without, payment.  His Sub-Committee took the view that it was unreasonable to exclude such persons.THE CHAIRMAN said that there was a good deal which would have to be worked out regarding the definition of &apos;&apos; gainful employment&apos;&apos; : for example, was it the intention to discriminate say between someone employed in writing for a newspaper and a person writing a novel ?Mr. CRAIG suggested that the bulk of the population would be covered by those possessing Insurance Cards. Most of the remaining cases would not present trouble, but it was recognised that there would be marginal cases, and it was the intention of the Report that the Ministry of Pensions should be entrusted with the task of working this out more fully.Mr. RAMSBOTHAM said that he was in general agreement with the scheme, and felt that it could be administered as set out in the Report.Mr. HORE-BELISHA pointed out that the civil workman might have the option of having Workman&apos;s Compensation benefit, whereas such option would be denied to the soldier.LORD HALIFAX wished to know on what principle the scheme was based. Was compensation related to deserts or to need ?Mr. CRAIG replied that one reason for setting up the Sub-Committee had been the fear that the danger of air attack might cause the population in threatened areas to abandon their occupations wholesale. The economic life of the country had to be carried on, and the Sub-Committee&apos;s Report was intended to provide an inducement to stay at work.LORD SWINTON agreed, and pointed out that there was a definite distinction between the man who was told to stay in a factory or in a trench, and the man, who, for the purpose of writing a book, elected to go to a safe place and in doing so fortuitously suffered injury or death.THE CHAIRMAN pointed out that there would be a large number of people who did not possess Insurance Cards, for example, the small shopkeeper.Mr. RAMSBOTHAM did not anticipate any substantial difficulty in distinguishing those earning their livings.SIR JOHN SIMON deprecated the suggestion that any public announcement should be made. It would be a dangerous thing if it was even hinted that any sort of national compensation scheme was in mind. Apart from finance, such an announcement would involve serious political difficulties.THE CHAIRMAN pointed out, in this connection, that the absence of any Government undertaking that volunteers for Air Raid Precautionary Services would be paid compensation in respect of injury in time of war was proving a definite hindrance to their recruitment.SIR SAMUEL HOARE confirmed this view. He said that he would almost certainly be pressed on this point in his forthcoming negotiations with the Local Authorities, and he would like to be in a position to announce that such compensation would be provided for Air Raid Precautions Personnel.   In making
&quot;such an announcement, however, he did not propose that any definite amounts should be specified or that reference should be made to any national scheme of compensation.SIR JOHN SIMON said that he had no objection to an appropriate announcement being made in respect of Air Raid Precautions Personnel, but that its wording would have to be very carefully considered.Mr. HORE-BELISHA thought that the Report could be adopted in principle, subject to the reservation for departmental discussion regarding the actual rate of compensation to be made.Conclusion. The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed to make the following recommendations to the Cabinet: (i) That the Report of the Sub-Committee on Compensation to Civiliansfor Loss of Life or injury from Air Attack (OLD. Paper No. 257-A) should be endorsed by the Cabinet as a suitable machinery, on the understanding that any decision as to whether or not a scheme of compensation should be put in force at the time of any future emergency is a matter for Government decision at the time, subject to (a) the settlement between the Treasury, War Office and the Ministryof Pensions, of the question raised by the Secretary of State for War regarding the relation of the scale of compensation proposed to that which would apply to a private soldier; and(b) the more precise definition by the Ministry of Pensions of theexpression &quot; gainfully employed.&quot;(ii) That the Minister of Pensions, in consultation with the other Depart-ments concerned, should work out the necessary details in accordance with the recommendations of the Report.(iii)&apos; That the necessary notations should be made in the War Book in order to ensure that the Minister of Pensions should bring the matter before the Cabinet on the outbreak of war.(iv) That no general announcement should be made regarding any national compensation scheme, but that the Home Secretary should be empowered, in the course of his forthcoming discussions with the Local Authorities, to state that the principle of compensation to Air Raid Precautions Personnel was accepted by the Government, without specifying any particular rate, or mentioning the fact that a National Scheme of Compensation was contemplated.* * * * * *2 Whitehall Gardens, S.

Composition and Terms of Reference.THE Air Raids Precautions (Organisation) Sub-Committee at its Thirteenth. Meeting, held on the 16th February, 1931, set up a Sub-Committee with the following Composition and Terms of Reference :  , Composition.*Mr. J. H. McC. Craig, C.B., Treasury (Chairman);Mr. P. N.

The Sub-Committee was originally set up in the early part of 1931 under the Chairmanship of Mr. H. E. Fass, of the Treasury. On Mr. Fass&apos;s resignation of the Chairmanship of the Sub-Committee, his place was taken by Mr. J. H. McC. Craig, of the Treasury.2. At the meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence held on the 14th November, 1929,1 an Interim RepOrt** by the Air Raids Precautions (Organisation) Sub-Committee was considered, and the Treasury were asked to draft a scheme of compensation for civilians who might suffer loss of life or injury through air attack, on the understanding, in effect, that questions of principle were not thereby prejudiced. A scheme was accordingly prepared which was, in the first instance, considered by a small Sub-Committee under Sir Charles Hipwood, which had the following Terms of Reference: &quot;With a view to defining the scope of compensation proposed in the Treasury Scheme, to examine (a) Whether it is possible to schedule the occupations that are necessaryfor maintaining the life and activities of London; or, alternatively,(b) Whether it is possible to schedule the occupations which could safely be eliminated.&quot;* Succeeded Mr. H.

3. This Sub-Committee, after going into the questions raised by their Terms of Reference, made the following recommendations : &quot; (a) That it is not practicable to schedule the occupations which may be necessary for maintaining the life and activities of London in the exceptional circumstances of a war of the nature assumed;(&amp;) That it would be feasible to draw up, on an arbitrary basis, a list of those occupations which ought to be eliminated, but that, since the percentage of occupations which could be classified in advance with certainty as non-essential is so very small, amounting to about 2 per cent., it is not worth while or desirable to complicate the scheme by attempting to exclude them;(c) That it will be necessary to define the terms  &apos; occupation&apos;  and&apos; occupied person,&apos; &quot;but the principle of the compensation scheme should be that an occupied person who is prepared to remain at work should be eligible for compensation in the event of injury, and his or her dependants should be eligible for the appropriate pension or allowance in the event of death;(d) That it would appear essential to consider whether or not the exodusfrom London should be controlled, and also whether arrangements will not be required for controlling the prime necessities and ensuring their fair distribution to those that remain.&quot;4. Following on representations submitted to the Air Raids Precautions (Organisation) Sub-Committee* by the then Chairman of the Compensation Sub-Committee, the instructions to the latter were amplified in the following manner: &quot; (a) that the Compensation Sub-Committee should be asked to work out their scheme on the basis that compensation should be confined to persons gainfully employed in a scheduled area, and for this purpose - -   it might be assumed that it would be possible to define such persons; (&amp;) that within the limits proposed the scheme should be as economical as possible consistently with its having the moral effect desired;(c) that it was clear that people of slender means must be provided with freecompensation, but it was not clear yet whether provision should be made by the State for people having means above a certain fixed limit, and if such provision had to be made, whether it should take the form of a contributory scheme or free compensation;(d) that it was desirable that the question where the means limit, if therewas to be one, should be drawn, and the question whether a contributory scheme would be practicable should be considered;(e) that at some period subsequent to the outbreak of war, it might be evenpossible to introduce some form of registration or tallies which would provide tangible proof that any individual was definitely gainfully employed, by authority, in a scheduled area, and, therefore, eligible for compensation;(/) that it may be necessary to grant some sums in respect of persons not eligible for compensation under the scheme to pay funeral expenses, &amp;c.;(g) that, although it is intended to confine the scheduled bombardment area to London in the first instance, it may be necessary to extend it and/or add other areas as the war progresses;(h) that the attention of the Compensation Sub-Committee should be drawn to the following suggestions-thrown out during the course of the discussion: (a) The idea of granting a flat rate of compensation to all eligible individuals up to a maximum, say, of two or three pounds a week;(6) The idea of a comprehensive State assisted insurance scheme to cover the whole of the United Kingdom on the theory that it might -be possible to reduce the premiums to a reasonable figure by thus averaging the risks instead of concentrating them in the most dangerous area.&quot;* See A.R.P. (0.),-25th Minutes.
The Sub-Committee submitted an Interim Report on the 24th July, 1934, which was considered by the Air Raid Precautions (Organisation) Sub-Committee at their meeting on the 27th July, 1934* The final report which repeats and completes the recommendations in the Interim Report is now submitted.Estimated Scale of Casualties.5. The Air Ministry estimate that an enemy could drop 600 tons of bombs per day on this country during the opening weeks of hostilities. The whole, or a considerable percentage, of this daily tonnage might be directed at London in the early days of hostilities.6. From the statistics of raids on London in the last war, the Air Ministry estimate that one ton of bombs dropped in a densely populated area may be expected to result in 50 casualties, of which one-third would be deaths and two-thirds would be injuries. On this basis, there would be 30,000 casualties per day throughout the country, of which 10,000 would be deaths and 20,000 injuries.The Air Ministry desired it to be understood that these estimated figures were tentative and applied to the opening weeks of hostilities only as it was quite impossible to make any forecast of casualties after the first six to eight weeks.7. If, as is hoped, a large scale measure of evacuation should be put into force, then it is possible that the estimate of casualties might be subject to some reduction.The casualties given above are purely physical casualties, no account having been taken of disabilities or diseases, such as nervous diseases, which might be indirectly attributable to air attack. So far as the Sub-Committee can ascertain no statistics from the last war are available other than statistics of physical casualties.8. The Air Ministry estimate of casualties is based on the experience of the last war and it does not make any special allowance for the use of poison gas. When it is necessary to assume a proportion of the daily tonnage of bombs dropped to be allotted to gas, the Air Ministry consider that 25 per cent, might be regarded as a reasonable amount.It is understood, however, that the Chemical Defence Research Department take the view that if the civil population have some training in anti-gas precautions and possess respirators, the number of casualties from gas is not likely to exceed the number of casualties from high explosive bombs, but the proportion of deaths from gas would be smaller and of injuries larger than from high explosive bombs.Much, however, depends on the state of preparedness of the population. The nse of a large number of incendiary bombs might also affect the figures, since these bombs are aimed primarily at the destruction of property rather than of life.Type of Scheme.9. Three types of scheme were considered from various points of view, including ease of administration (a) A scheme of Insurance undertaken either by the State or by insurance companies acting in conjunction with the State.(b) A free scheme of compensation by the State, the benefits being related to earnings.(c) A scheme similar to (b) but with a flat rate of benefit.The third is recommended for the following reasons.:10. Insurance is impracticable for the bulk of the population. The charge for benefits on such a scale as is recommended in this Report would, even with a considerable measure of financial assistance from the Exchequer, be quite beyond the means of most of the working-class. It is probable, in any case, that even small premiums would usually have to be borne by the employer or met by increased wages, and that the charge would, in the circumstances of a war, be largely passed on to the State. In many cases, moreover, the premiums would not be paid even in threatened areas, either througli^inability or inertia, and unless* See A.R.P. (O.) 436.
the principal object of the scheme was to be defeated, benefits would have to be granted irrespective of the contributory principle. It would, in any case, be necessary to grant free compensation during an initial period, perhaps a month, to give time for the system of insurance to be brought into full operation. It is precisely during this period that the heaviest casualties are expected. The diversion of man-power to the machinery of explanation, registration and accounting is undesirable.11. The Sub-Committee consider it clear that the impossibility of assessing the risk with any precision would preclude private insurers from under-taking the business otherwise than as agents of the Government. In addition, unlike the problem before the Committee on Insurance against Aircraft and Bombardment Risks, which involves the payment of compensation in respect of damage to property, the scheme of compensation against personal injury coh-templated by the Sub-Committee, requires no expert experience which could not be provided by the then staffs of Government Departments. The employment of private insurers, therefore, appears to the Sub-Committee not only to be uneconomical, but to afford no advantages over a scheme administered by the Government. There is a possibility of irresponsible insurance companies under-taking risks which are either excluded by responsible insurers from policies issued after the outbreak of war or not normally insured against in time of peace. It is thought unlikely that action of the kind would materialise on any substantial scale in the initial stages of such a war as is contemplated in the terms of reference, while, if it did materialise later, it is thought that public opinion would support the Government in any steps they might contemplate to prevent the defrauding of the public.12. The Sub-Committee see difficulties of both principle and practice in adopting the basis followed in the scheme drafted in the Treasury of benefits varying in accordance with civilian earnings.Anomalies and possibilities of grievances can hardly be avoided in any definition of pay or earnings for the purpose of calculating compensation, and in the definition of the period over which they are to be assessed; the more so if the war is an occasion of rapid economic change.The ascertainment of individual pay or earnings may be found to be impossible through the destruction of records or death or departure of witnesses. Undesirable delays in determining compensation would certainly occur.An estimate of the cost of the scheme recommended in this Report is given in paragraph 56 and the Sub-Committee are advised that the adoption of the scheme drafted in the Treasury would be unlikely to involve any saving in cost.13. Apart from these disadvantages from the administrative point of view, any proposal to grant a reasonable fraction of civilian earnings would in many cases provide individual civilians with a higher scale of compensation than members of the Defence Forces whose earnings in civil life had been comparable, a proposal which would be regarded as obviously unfair to persons ; who had enlisted in those Forces. The Sub-Committee are accordingly clear that to grant compensation to civilians at a greater rate than that, generally available to personnel of the Defence Forces would be wrong in principle, and would create difficulties for the Government. In fact, the Sub-Committee have been given to understand that the Army Council-would view with considerable misgiving a scheme which would treat civilians not directly engaged in the prosecution of a war even in the same way as members of the fighting forces.In addition; the principle followed by the State in schemes of insurance against the misfortunes of civil life-unemployment; sickness, including permanent (disablement, and old age-is that of benefits at a fixed rate which does not vary with the previous earnings of the individual.Possibility of State Scheme of Voluntary Insurance.14. The Sub-Committee, for the reasons set out in paragraphs 10-13, are of the opinion that a free scheme of compensation is most desirable. They have carefully considered, but do not recommend, a scheme of State insurance as a
supplement to the free compensation proposed. Under such a scheme additional benefits, or benefits at higher rates, would be obtainable in return for suitable premiums by those who could afford to pay them. It is clearly impossible to calculate the requisite premium with any pretension to accuracy, but we are advised that, on the basis of the casualties mentioned in paragraph 6, if the scheme were to be self-supporting, it would be necessary to fix the requisite premium at a prohibitive level. The opportunity to obtain such further benefits could not, moreover, be confined to civilians and refused to personnel of the Defence Forces, whether privates or of higher rank. The increased benefits would thus become, in individual instances at first, supplements to the pensions appro-priate for the various ranks, and it would seem highly probable, especially if persons who had insured as civilians joined the Forces in any numbers, that their existence would endanger the maintenance of the regulated pension rates.15. The Sub-Committee do not think that the undertaking by the State of an insurance scheme (whether on the lines of the compensation scheme recommended or for the grant of lump sum benefits payable in certain contingencies) in respect of danger to life and limb can ultimately be reconciled with the provision proposed to be made for members of the Defence Forces, or that a scheme which involved heavy pecuniary sacrifices by persons living in districts exposed to very different, but unforeseeable, degrees of danger could be administered without serious friction. This would undoubtedly arise from the withholding of the additional insurance benefit in the case of casualties which had followed shortly on the lapsing of a policy, and in the case of casualties in areas not previously believed to be threatened, and in which, accordingly, the premiums appeared prohibitive in relation to the additional benefits, and it might also arise in the event of &quot; profits &quot; being made in areas believed to be threatened, but not, in fact, raided.16. The question of the practicability of a scheme of State insurance supplementary to the Compensation scheme has been considered in the Board of Trade, who find no reason to differ from the conclusion expressed in paragraphs 14 and 15 above and express the view that a scheme of State insurance is neither desirable nor practicable.Area to be Scheduled.17. The Sub-Committee were instructed to consider a scheme on the basis that compensation would be confined, at least in the first instance, to a scheduled area; but they have come to the conclusion that any such restriction would be impracticable and undesirable.18. Hostile air attacks presumably will not be confined to London or to any area which can be scheduled with precision. Although the importance of keeping London going may be paramount, it would be impossible to exclude from the scheme the inhabitants of other areas in Great Britain in which injury is sustained or serious apprehension is felt. Claims to participate in the scheme could not be resisted either on the grounds of relative immunity, or on the grounds that the place of the worker&apos;s; domicile was of minor importance in the prosecution of the war. Moreover, under any reasonably close definition of the scheduled area, numbers of border-line cases would inevitably arise, with the result that any areas initially scheduled would be subject to continual modification, adding to complication and friction without any proportionate results.19. The primary object of maintaining morale and inducing people to remain at work under difficult conditions would not be assisted by the arbitrary limitation of the area of application of a scheme, and any such limitation would at once become a subject for agitation in areas lying outside the prescribed limits.20..   In the. light of these considerations, therefore, the Sub-Committee \ believe that restriction to a scheduled area or areas is undesirable and would, in any case, only be possible for a few days--in effect, until damage occurs in districts excluded.   &quot;Whether it will be considered worth while, with a view to
lllrinVaL Zl?T mfluence on      persons normally employed in the most * dangerous area, to apply any such restrictions temporarilys a matter for consideration,   The Sub-Committee feel they can only suggest 1SUS nation being desired, that the most convenient area would nriH      t-p*e a    Metropolitan Police District, plus Romford, Watford, Slough and Dartford which must be included in view of the density of the populationschldnled wS? if concentratlon in. ^ese areas. The limits&quot; of; any area to S scheduled will, however, require review from time to time.Scope of Scheme.21. The Sub-Committee have considered whether the scheme should cover all persons gainfully occupied (other than members of the Defence Forces) or should be restricted to persons whose remuneration does not exceed a certain limit, e.g.,  250 per annum, the limit under the National Health Insurance and Unemployment Insurance Acts; or  350 per annum, the limit under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts.22. They consider that if either of these limits or any other arbitrary limit is adopted, the object of the scheme of compensation is liable to be defeated by its exclusion of a large number of workers whose services are vitally necessary, and who are, in the main, dependent on their current earnings. Acute financial hardship will follow serious disablement or death for a high proportion of this class, even in cases where the earnings are substantially above  350 per.annum. Whatever limit, low enough to be of much effect, is imposed, a sense of grievance will be created amongst the excluded by the grant of compensation to persons whose former earnings were not greatly inferior and whose subsequent position is no worse, and may in individual cases be actually better, than their own.23. Precise figures are not available, but it is thought that the number of gainfully occupied persons would only be reduced by some 5 per cent, by the exclusion of those whose earnings exceeded  350 per annum. As it is proposed that compensation should not vary with earnings, the cost of the Sub-Committee^ proposals would be reduced in approximately the same ratio. If, therefore, the maximum limit is placed at a comparatively high figure, its effect on reducing the total cost of the scheme will be small, while the marginal cases will continue to occur.24. The Sub-Committee do not, therefore, recommend the exclusion of persons whose earnings exceed a given figure, however substantial. This conclusion appears to them to agree with the conclusions reached by the Committee* on Insurance against Aircraft and Bombardment Risks in favour of a measure of compensation for destruction of property, irrespective of the total means or capital of the owner. The Sub-Committee have considered, but do not recommend, for the reasons given in paragraph 10, the charge of a premium, nominal or otherwise, to persons whose earnings exceed a particular figure.25. The Sub-Committee accordingly propose that the test of eligibility should be limited to proof that a person is either gainfully occupied or genuinely seeking employment. This will make for much greater simplicity in administra-tion, a point of considerable importance, and there should be little difficulty in the persons concerned being able to produce such proof. Persons insured under the National Health Insurance and Contributory Pensions Acts (other than voluntary contributors) and persons registered for employment at Employment Exchanges could ordinarily be taken as automatically qualified for inclusion. The onus would rest on persons not so registered or insured to prove that they were, in fact, gainfully occupied within the scheduled area or the United Kingdom as the case may be..If*a.system of national registration,for employment should be introduced as an emergency measure, this test should be substituted for that suggested and unregistered persons should be excluded from benefit.* Paragraph 33 of C.I.D. Paper No. 1052-B.
[14764]c26. The Sub-Committee consider that members of air raid precautionary services, whether or not they are regarded as gainfully employed in virtue of those services, should be considered as under the scheme, unless other arrangements are made under the terms of their engagement.The Sub-Committee also consider that persons who are engaged as volunteers and without payment for a substantial portion of their time on Government or war work must be covered by the scheme, although technically they may not be gainfully occupied.The Sub-Committee have considered whether the scheme should be limited to persons of British nationality, but they take the view, provisionally, that in so far as resident aliens, other than enemy aliens, are gainfully occupied, the presumption should be that it is in the interests of the State that, subject to such conditions as may be laid down by the administering Department, they should not be disdouraged from pursuing their occupations by exclusion from the scheme.27. The Sub-Committee suggest that, as in the case of the National Health Insurance Act, it would be desirable for the Government to take powers to exclude from the scheme particular classes of occupation or employment, for example, persons gainfully occupied only to an inconsiderable extent, persons who have abandoned their occupations, persons who have refused to obey any orders of evacuation, &amp;c. It is impracticable at the present stage to define the precise classes of persons who should properly be excluded.Persons not Gainfully Occupied.28. The Sub-Committee have further considered the view recorded in paragraph 4 (a) above, and do not recommend the inclusion in the scope of the compensation scheme of any cases, e.g., married women not gainfully occupied, other than those of certain voluntary workers (paragraph 26), in which the person disabled or killed has not been engaged in earning money, notwithstanding that such persons, or those who benefited by their services, may be put to expense.Type of Casualty.29. The Sub-Committee recommend that compensation under the scheme should be confined to physical casualties directly caused by the incidents of a raid and should not apply, for example, to sickness or aggravation of sickness attributed to nervous strain, exposure, deprivation of comforts and facilities, or disturbance of the usual routine of life.  The chief reasons are : (a) the difficulty of checking the alleged attributability to air attack of the disease or aggravation;(b) the difficulty of obtaining any sort of reasonable estimate of the actualdegree of attributability;(c) the danger of encouraging hysterical complaints by allowing compensa-tion in such cases.The restriction to physical casualties is not, however, intended to exclude cases of concussion or contusion of the brain, notwithstanding the absence of evidence of external injury.Scale of Compensation. Men.30. The Interdepartmental Committee on Dependants and Disability Pensions in a Future Great War* (hereafter referred to in this Report as the Pensions Committee) have come to the conclusion (paragraphs 280-282) that a scheme of alternative pensions to provide for cases in, which civilian earnings had been high would be inexpedient for members of the Defence Forces and their dependants. The considerations which they adduce apply equally to the awards in respect of injuries to civilians.31. The Sub-Committee recommend, on grounds of consistency, ready intelligibility to the public and ease of administration, that adult male persons gainfully occupied, in cases of total or partial disablement, and the widows and* Document A. 3341 of November 1930.
children of persons gainfully occupied, in cases of death, should be compensated in accordance with the scale of awards which is recommended for non-regular privates and their widows and children in the Report of the Pensions Committee. The basic rate for a totally disabled single man without dependants is 32s. 6d. per week and for a widow over 60 20s. per week. The principal rates are set out, together with those recommended in the following paragraphs, in the Appendix to this Report.32. Having regard to the objects of their scheme, the Sub-Committee do not consider that the analogy of members of the Defence Forces should be pressed to the extent of securing the grant of compensation to dependants other than wives and children. The Pensions Committee contemplate awards in certain restricted circumstances only to such other-dependants, viz. : a parent or parents, a grand-father, grandmother, stepfather, stepmother, grandson, granddaughter, brother, sister, half-brother, half-sister, or person in loco parentis. The claim, however, to such contingent benefit of members of the Forces who are serving under definite engagements appears to be stronger than that of gainfully employed persons generally. On the other hand, the extent of support given to such relatives, often not even in money form, by a deceased civilian up to the date of the casualty, will generally be harder to ascertain than in the case of members of the Forces.33. It was suggested by the Air Raids Precautions (Organisation) Sub-Committee (vide paragraph 4 (h)) that a flat rate of compensation might be granted up to a maximum of  2 or  3 a week. The maximum figure resulting from the above recommendations for total disablement of a married man with children is 49s. 2d. a week.Women.34. The pension for total disablement recommended by the Pensions Committee (paragraph 326) for women members of military organisations of all ranks below that of officer (with the exception of one class whose duties will include some graded as officer duties) is the same as that recommended for a non-regular private without dependants, viz., 32s. Qd. a week. Additions are proposed for a dependent husband and children (paragraph 327). These recommendations do not extend to women serving in civilian organisations (paragraph 314). Having regard to the difference which, in fact, obtains between the average earnings in civil life of the mass of men and women gainfully occupied, the Sub-Committee think that, under a system of flat-rate awards, the rate for a woman gainfully occupied should approximate to two-thirds of that for a man. Accordingly, they recommend a rate for total disablement of 22s. Qd. a week.35. The Sub-Committee have considered whether awards should be made in any circumstances to a husband in respect of a wife&apos;s death. They are informed that when the Widows&apos; Contributory Pensions Scheme was introduced, it was decided, after examination of the questions of policy and administration involved, not to extend that scheme to widowers. Similar considerations would apply to awards to widowers under the Sub-Committee&apos;s scheme and, accordingly, the Sub-Committee do not recommend that widowers should be entitled as such to compensation under the scheme.36. The Sub-Committee do not recommend that awards to a gainfully occupied woman should be increased in respect of an invalid husband, but they consider that allowances in respect of children in cases of disablement of the mother, and awards to children in respect of the death of the mother, should be made where the father is incapable of work or has died or disappeared.Where this condition is fulfilled the additions and awards should be, in the case of disablement, at the same rates as for the children of a disabled man who draws no allowance in respect of a wife and, in case of death, at the same rates as for motherless children of a man who is killed. It should, however, be pointed out that the Pensions Committee, while recommending a uniform allowance of 10s. a week for children who have lost both parents in the case of male other ranks (paragraph 94), recommend this rate for the first child only in the case of /women of other ranks, with a lower rate of 7s. Qd. for each other child. The Sub-Committee have omitted this differentiation for the sake of simplicity in dealing with civilians.
37. Having regard to the practical difficulty of defining and ascertaining previous earnings and to their recommendation, as regards honorary workers (paragraph 26), the Sub-Committee do not feel able to recommend that awards should be limited as a maximum to the earnings actually enjoyed prior to injury, but they must point out that, both in the case of men and to a larger extent in that of women, in a number of instances of part-time,or even of whole-time employment the payments recommended above may exceed the regular earnings enjoyed.J uveniles.38. The Sub-Committee recommend that juveniles gainfully occupied who are disabled before reaching the age of twenty-one should be granted less than the adult rate, but that, in view of the general practice of industry, the grant should be raised te the full rate on attaining twenty-one. The following scales are suggested:- Males. Females.s.   d. s.   d.Over 14 years and less than 17 years ...   10   0 per week      10   0 per week 17                    ,,      19         ...   15   0 13   6    ,,,,    19      ,,            ,,      21   ,,     ...   22   6       ,, 17   6    ,,,,    21 years    ...........,   32   6       ,, 22   6    ,,The recommendation in this paragraph does not extend to juveniles who are disabled before entering upon gainful Occupation.Definition of Wife and Children.39. The Sub-Committee consider that the definition of a wife and children, including unmarried wives and illegitimate children, for the purposes of com-pensation, should be that adopted by the Defence Departments at the time the scheme is put into operation, and that no compensation should normally be granted in respect of dependency arising subsequently to the injury, e.g., a wife married subsequently, children by a subsequent marriage, or children by an existing marriage born more than nine months after the date of the injury.- Conditions of Grant of Compensation.40. Awards of compensation may be either temporary and subject to variation or permanent. The amount will vary with the degree of permanent disablement assessed as for members of the Defence Forces. A lump sum award only will be made for minor disabilities. The Sub-Committee are of opinion that awards other than a lump sum should not be capable of commutation and should not be assignable.Awards to a widow in respect of her husband&apos;s death will cease on re-marriage and awards and allowances to children will normally cease at age 16.The continuance of compensation should be subject to the same general conditions as apply to the continuance of disability award or wife&apos;s pension in the case of disablement or death with the Forces.41. No person should be entitled to draw two compensation allowances under the Sub-Committee&apos;s scheme or a compensation allowance under that scheme and an allowance or pension in respect of the disablement or death of a person in the Defence Forces (or for whom provision is made under other schemes against special war risks). Thus a married woman who is gainfully occupied should be allowed to draw compensation allowance in respect of the death of a husband by whom she was supported or in respect of her own disablement but not both allowances, and allowances for children should be granted in respect of either parent, not both. The Sub-Committee understand, however, that the whole question of the relation between awards made in respect of injuries or deaths in a future war of members of the Forces and awards previously made to or in respect of the same person is under consideration. Their recommendation in this paragraph will require to be amplified in the regulations of the administering Department in the light of decision reached.In cases in which a claim to compensation lies under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts in respect of an injury or death, which gives rise also to a claim to compensation under the scheme proposed in this Report, the Sub-[14764] d
Committee recommend that the &quot;workman,&quot; or his dependants in case of death, should be allowed. to. elect whether to take compensation under the Sub-Committee&apos;^ scheme or to exercise his, or their, rights under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts. :Scheme benefit should not be paid to a person who has established a claim to workmen&apos;s compensation in respect of an injury; and where a person receives benefit under the Sub-Committee&apos;s scheme the employer should be relieved of liability to pay workmen&apos;s compensation in respect of the same injury.As the rates under the Sub-Committee&apos;s scheme are on the whole more favourable than those under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts workpeople may be expected, normally, to elect to take compensation under the scheme. It would, however, be very undesirable on general grounds to deprive them of their rights under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts, although in practice it will be found that these rights will not be exercised. Should circumstances so change that the rates of benefit suggested are less favourable than those under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts, the whole question will require further consideration.This arrangement will necessitate an amendment of the Workmen&apos;s Com-pensation Acts, and in the amending legislation some provision will be necessary to enable the Courts in dealing with a claim under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts by a dependant who is ineligible for compensation under the Sub-Committee&apos;s scheme, to take into account the benefits paid or to be paid to another dependant under the scheme.Cases in which a claim to compensation lies under the Employers&apos; Liability Act or at Common Law should be dealt with on similar lines.42. Clearly some time must elapse between the occurrence of an injury or death and the award of compensation under the proposed scheme. The Sub-Committee assume that other emergency arrangements will be made for the immediate relief of distress and they consider that, in the interests of simplicity of administration, awards under the scheme should normally be made from a current date and without retrospective effect.The Sub-Committee consider that no compensation should be paid in respect of injured persons with no admissible dependants while the former are in hospital or maintained at the public expense.In the case of persons with admissible dependants who are required after the initial period of treatment to undergo a further course of treatment as hospital in-patients in respect of recurring effects of an air raid injury and who are deemed in consequence unable to provide by their normal earnings for their own support and that of their families, the Sub-Committee recommend that an allowance be paid equivalent to compensation at the maximum rate subject to a deduction of an amount not exceeding Is. Qd. per day in respect of maintenance as proposed in paragraph 272 of the report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Dependants and Disability Pensions in a Future Great War.In the case of persons in receipt of public assistance, unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance prior to admission to such a course of treatment, the Sub-Committee recommend the payment of such an allowance within the maximum referred to as in the circumstances the Department administering the scheme deems proper.The Sub-Committee recommend that the Regulations of the administering Department should provide for deduction from the compensation otherwise payable to a disabled person during periods of absence from work attributable to the injury and prior to a stabilised award, in respect of sick pay payable under a contract of service or well-established custom.It is important, both in the interests of the claimant and of equitable administration, that where disablement ensues from an injury a claim for compensation under the scheme should be made as early as possible; and it is for consideration whether a time limit should not at some date be imposed upon claims.Payment of Funeral Expenses. &apos; 43. The Sub-Committee do not propose that grants should be made as a rule in respect of funeral expenses. They understand that it is contemplated that the responsibility for interments will, in general, be undertaken by the Local Sanitary Authorities. On this understanding, payment of funeral expenses to persons who may desire to make their own arrangements does not seem necessary.-  If,
in. any area it is found to be unnecessary for the Sanitary Authority to accept responsibility for interments, owing to the fewness of the casualties or for any other reason, the Sub-Committee suggest that the Department administering the scheme should be given discretionary powers to make grants, not exceeding  5 in each case, towards the funeral expenses.Earnings or Means continuing after Injury.44. The Sub-Committee are of opinion that the assessment of disablement should be based primarily on physical impairment and not on actual lessening of earning capacity, but that until the disability has reached a final condition regard should be paid to any increased or revived earnings as probably indicating an improvement in the condition of the disability. Once the disability has reached a final condition, they do not consider that in practice account by way of offset can be taken generally of earnings which continue or revive after the date of the disability. They have thought it impracticable, having regard to the ooject of their enquiry, to recommend in general the withholding of compensation, either in cases of disability or death, if or when, earnings, or incomes from other sources, exceed a stated rate.There are, however, important classes of cases in which income will be drawn in consequence of the same death or injury from funds which themselves throw a charge upon the State.National Health Insurance, Widows&apos;, Orphans&apos; and Old Age Contributory Pensions.45. The most important cases of which account must be taken are the benefits and pensions payable under and by virtue of the National Health Insurance Acts and the Widows&apos;, Orphans&apos; and Old Age Contributory Pensions Acts. The account to be taken of benefits under the Widows&apos;, Orphans&apos; and Old Age Pensions (Voluntary Contributors) Bill now before Parliament will require consideration when the legislation has been passed..As regards benefits payable under the National Health Insurance Acts, the arrangements made during the Great War were (a) The rates of sickness and disablement benefits payable to a person inreceipt of a pension for disablement in the highest degree were reduced by 7s. Qd. per week, the effect in the ordinary case being that the sickness benefit was reduced by one-half and that no disablement benefit was payable; the reduction ceases to operate as regards sickness benefit when the man has been in insurable employment or engaged in a regular occupation during 26 weeks and 26 weekly contributions have been paid in respect of him, and as regards disablement benefit when he has been in insurable employment or engaged in a regular occupation for 104 weeks and 104 weekly contributions have been paid.(b) The funds of &quot;Approved Societies,&quot; i.e., the organisations which areresponsible for the payment of National Health Insurance benefits, were recouped by the Exchequer for any losses arising as a result of abnormal payments of benefit to men disabled in the War whether or not they were entitled to 100 per cent, disability War pensions. Recoupment grants were made to Societies until the end of 1920, when they were discontinued because, owing to the reduction in number of invalided men in respect of whom payment of pension was being made as a result of the recovery and return to industry of a substantial proportion of them, it was found that the residual additional liabilities referred to were counterbalanced by other factors, e.g., war mortality, which had resulted in profit to Societies46. The Sub-Committee are informed that the Pensions Committee have recommended the modification of the arrangements described in paragraph 45 (a), their proposal being that: &apos;&apos; Where National Health Insurance benefit is payable to a member of the Forces in respect of a disability on account of which he is receiving disability retired pay or pension, the maximum award payable in respect of insurance benefit and retired pay or pension should not temporarily [14764] d 2
only, but as a permanent arrangement, be the sum of the retired pay or pension appropriate for total disablement and one-half of the insurance benefit; and we recommend that the adjustment should be made in the insurance benefit and that, if necessary, legislation authorising this should be undertaken.&quot;47. In the case of pensions payable under the Contributory Pensions Act the position is as follows : The original Act came into force in 1926, and under Section 24 a widow, in receipt of a Service dependants Pension (other than in respect of a son&apos;s or step-son^ service in the Great War), is disqualified from receipt of a pension under the Act except where the service pension is less than the Contributory Act pension, in which event the balance only is payable as an addition to the Service Dependant&apos;s Pension. No amendment of this Section is suggested in the report of the Pensions Committee, and presumably, therefore, it is intended that thegrinciples of Section 24 should be applied to widows becoming entitled to ervice dependants Pensions as a result of a future Great War.48. It is understood that the proposals of the Pensions Committee are still under consideration by the responsible Authorities, in particular by the Ministry of Health., In the circumstances, the Sub-Committee content themselves with the recom-mendation that whatever arrangements are made in regard to the health and pensions benefits of men who are killed or disabled while serving in the forces in a future Great War should also be made applicable to the corresponding benefits of civilians who are killed or disabled in an air raid in that War, with appropriate adjustments in the case of women.49. It is clearly impossible to state in advance what would be the net effect of War casualties in a future Great War on the finances of Approved Societies under the Health Insurance Scheme. As already indicated, their liabilities would be reduced by fatal casualties, but increased by any abnormal payments of sickness or disablement benefits which they were called upon to pay in respect of incapacity resulting from War injuries.When the financial structure of the National Health Insurance Scheme was framed the possibility of a future Great War and its effect on the Scheme could obviously not be taken into account. If, therefore, the arrangements made in respect of the health benefits of both men in the Forces and of civilians should involve a strain on the funds of Approved Societies, the question of some recoupment by the Exchequer would presumably have to be considered.Police and Firemen.50. Under the existing statutory superannuation schemes applicable to police and full-time professional firemen, when men are injured or killed on duty (the usual type of case that will arise) special pensions will become payable which are at least equivalent to the scale recommended under the Sub-Committee&apos;s scheme for ordinary civilians and their widows. There will, however, be certain cases of police and firemen, mainly of short service and hurt while not on duty, where benefits payable under existing statutory provisions will be less than the figure the Sub-Committee have recommended for a totally incapacitated civilian, and also cases where a police or fireman&apos;s widow will be entitled to less than the amount which is proposed for the widow of a civilian. , In all such cases it is recommended that the statutory benefits payable to police and firemen or their widows should be brought up to the scale laid down for ordinary civilians and their widows; the most convenient course will be for the local police and fire brigade authorities, in the few cases where the question will arise, to pay the men and widows concerned the full compensation rate recommended for ordinary civilians and their widows, and then to recover from the Exchequer the amount of the difference between what is due under the existing statutory provisions and the amount actually paid. No difficulty should arise in practice if this method is adopted, though, in those cases where gratuities are payable under the statute, the annuity values equivalent to these will require to be worked out in order that the sums payable by the Government may be calculated.
51. Subject to these arrangements the Sub-Committee recommend the exclusion of police and full-time professional firemen from the compensation scheme. Part-time firemen, whose services are met by retaining fees paid by the local authorities concerned, and volunteer firemen, will come within the compensation scheme either by virtue of their main occupation or as a result of the recommendation in paragraph 26 of this Report.Regular serving police (other than Metropolitan Police short-service constables) and police and other full-time professional firemen are excepted as such from the National Health Insurance and Contributory Pensions Schemes. Claims to benefit under these schemes might, however, arise in the case of injury through enemy action received by police and firemen with less than two years&apos; service, or by special constables. There is also a small class of men who, having acquired the qualification for voluntary insurance under the National Health Insurance and Contributory Pensions Acts by virtue of previous insurable employment, become and remain voluntary contributors and entitled to benefits under these Acts during and after retirement from service as policemen or firemen. It is recommended that police and firemen and their widows who are entitled to benefit under these Acts, in addition to their other statutory benefits, and who are injured by enemy action, should be dealt with on the lines set out in paragraph 50, all the statutory benefits being taken into account.Civil Servants.52. Should the death or disablement of a civil servant (whether established or unestablished) give rise to a valid claim under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts or under the Injury Warrant framed under the Superannuation Acts, the Sub-Committee recommend that the person concerned or his dependants should be granted either the benefits for which he is eligible under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts or the Injury Warrant, or the benefits of the scheme of compensation, whichever may be the most favourable, but not more than one.In the event of civil servants becoming eligible for injury awards under any other Acts, Warrants or Schemes, the same principle should be applied.Provided that the civil servant or his dependants receive no special award on account of his injury or death, the Sub-Committee consider that receipt of compensation under the proposed scheme should not be affected by any awards which would have been made on a retirement or death due to natural causes.Officers of Local Authorities, &amp;c.53. The Sub-Committee recommend that persons entitled to benefits from the Superannuation Funds of Local Authorities, Universities, Public Corpora-tions, &amp;c, and teachers serving in grant-aided schools should be dealt with in the same manner as civil servants; and that receipt of compensation under the proposed scheme should not be affected by the award of superannuation allowances or gratuities, except in the contingency of the award of special pensions or gratuities superior to those payable on death or disablement from natural causes.Administration of the Scheme.54. The Sub-Committee recommend that the administration of the scheme should be entrusted to the Ministry of Pensions, if still in existence, or if that Department has ceased to exist and is not recreated, to the Ministry of Health. They recommend that the preparation of the necessary enactment, regulations and forms should be undertaken by the Ministry of Pensions.Compassionate Fund.55. The Sub-Committee recognise the likelihood of cases of financial hardship which will not come within the necessarily definite limits of the scheme recommended, but which nevertheless, particularly in view of the availability of compensation for other types of cases, may appear to call for relief! It is probable that in the circumstances of a war involving air raids on this country a relief fund will be raised by public subscription, either with or without a Government contribution. The Sub-Committee consider that such a charitable fund, which can be administered more at discretion than is possible with public monies, is the best way of meeting exceptional cases amongst those which lie outside the scheme.
... Cost. ,&apos; 56. Having regard to the many uncertainties involved, no reliable estimate of the cost of the Sub-Committee&apos;s proposals is practicable. The Sub-Committee recognise, however, that some indication of the order of magnitude of the cost is required, and they accordingly set out below tentative estimates of the cost of the proposed scheme. In so doing they wish to emphasize that their estimates must be taken as giving no more than a rough indication of the probable cost in relation to a particular level of casualties.For the purpose of the estimates it has been assumed that hostilities would continue for a period of 60 days. During this period, on the basis of the scale of casualties set out in paragraphs 5 to 8, the total number of casualties might amount to 600,000 killed and 1,200,000 wounded. These figures are admittedly subject to very wide variations. Again, the distribution by sex and age of whatever number of casualties is assumed and the assessment of the related number of dependants is a matter of great difficulty. In the early stages of hostilities it might be reasonable to assume that casualties would be distributed proportionately to the normal population, or rather, perhaps, the normal popula-tion in the more densely populated areas. But within a short time the position would presumably be affected by the drafting of men into the defence forces, and the transfer of sections of the civilian population for various reasons from one area to another. Further, the distribution of casualties would doubtless be affected by the proportion of attacks which took place at night.With so many elements of uncertainty, the Sub-Committee are advised that it would be pedantic to do other than to assume that the casualties would consist of; an average section of the general population as regards age, sex, family responsibilities, &amp;c, despite the obvious objections to this course. In this view the Sub-Committee concur. Moreover, the cost of compensation will depend on the proportion of the injury casualties ranking for compensation who die, or who are permanently disabled, on the degree of disablement to which the latter are subject, and on the duration of incapacity of the temporarily disabled. For this purpose, in view of the lack of data, it has been necessary for us to assume that the experience in these respects would be similar to that of members of the army wounded in the Great War.The Sub-Committee are advised that, taking a total of 1,800,000 casualties during the period of 60 days, the estimated capital cost of the proposed scheme would amount to about  120,000,000, excluding payments made in the early days before the arrangements had become effective. The payments corresponding to this capital sum would emerge over a very long period, since they would consist to a large extent of annuities to widows, but, owing to payments in cases of temporary disablement, the heaviest cost would be in the first year, during which it is estimated that the expenditure would be about  i9,000,000. This figure relates to the first full year&apos;s cost, starting from the date when the scheme of compensation became fully operative. In the second year the cost would probably fall to about  9,000,000, and in the next few years it would dwindle by about  500,000 a year, reaching  7,500,000 in the fifth year.
Summary of ^Recommendations. 57.   The following is a summary of the Sub-Committee&apos;s main recommenda-tions with a reference to the relative paragraphs in the Report: (a) General insurance against death or disablement in air raids, is considered impracticable (10-16).(&amp;) The limitation of eligibility for compensation to persons occupied or resident in a specified area or areas is considered impracticable (17-20).(c) Compensation, not dependent on payment of premiums, should be granted from public funds in respect of such death or disablement of gainfully occupied persons, irrespective of their means (21-26).(d) Power is reserved to exclude persons gainfully occupied only to an , inconsiderable extent. (27)......... (e) Persons not gainfully occupied are.excluded (28). (/) The scale of compensation should be :- .To an adult man in respect of his total or partial disablement and to, the wife and children of a gainfully occupied person in .&apos;        ,        respect of his death, the grants recommended by the Inter-departmental Committee on Dependants&apos; and Disability Pensions in a Future Great War for a non-regular private (30-33).To an adult woman in respect of her total disablement 22s. 6d. a week, in respect of her partial disablement proportionate rates, and to her children, in certain circumstances only, the rates recommended for the children of a non-regular private (34-37).To a juvenile person gainfully occupied in respect of his or her disablement, a lower rate of grant to be raised to the adult rate on reaching 21 (38).(g) Dependants of a man, other than a wife or child, and dependants of a woman, other than a child in certain circumstances, are excluded (32 and 36).(K) A claim in respect of one casualty should exclude a claim by the same person or dependant in respect of another, also due to operations of war (41).(i) Compensation should not be granted under the scheme in addition to compensation under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts (41).(j) Payment towards funeral expenses is not recommended, except in special circumstances (43).       . ,,    .\k) The continuance of means or earnings after the casualty should not exclude payment of compensation (44).(Z) Benefits under the National Health Insurance, Widows&apos;, Orphans&apos; and Old Age Contributory Pensions Acts should be dealt with as for members of the Defence Forces (45-49).(m) Police and full-time professional firemen should be dealt with under their statutory pension schemes, with a supplementary grant from Exchequer funds in the exceptional cases where the compensation proposed by this Report would be more favourable (50-51).(n) Awards, if any, to Civil Servants under the Workmen&apos;s Compensa-tion Acts, Schemes thereunder or the Injury Warrants under the Superannuation Acts, should be alternative and not additional to compensation (52).(o) The administration of the scheme of compensation should be entrusted to the Ministry of Pensions (54).(p) An estimate of the cost is given in paragraph 56.(Signed) J.
