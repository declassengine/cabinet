(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) SECRETCP. 353(5-7)o Copy No. tl)CABINET. Cables and Wireless Limited.Memorandum &quot;by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.1.       My colleagues will remember that last year the need for internal reorganisation of this Company and for a re-adjustment of its relations with the Empire Governments was brought to a head by a widespread demand for a reduction of cable and wireless rates between the countries of the Empire.The matter was examined by the Advisory Committee of the Company, which consists of Empire Government representatives under the Chairmanship of Sir Campbell Stuart.      This Advisory Committee, after consultation with the Company, put forward certain recommendations vrtiieh subject to modest alterations were laid before the Cabinet by the present Prime Minister in his memorandum of the 29th January, CP.42(37), and received general Cabinet approval.   The proposals were thereupon communicated to the Empire Governments and I am glad to be able to report that after lengthy negotiations an appropriate settlement has been reached.Briefly, the proposals were as follows:-(1) A satisfactory reduction of rates to be negotiated.(2) The United Kingdom Government to give up the balance of the 25 year annuity of  250,000 per annum now payable by the Company to the G.P.O. for the Wireless Beam rental, the United Kingdom Government receiving in lieu 3,000,000  1 shares to be found from the existing  30 million capital of the Company.
(3)    The arrangements governing the standard revenue of the Company to he modified.(4)    The Company to be compensated by the Empire Governments concerned for the upkeep of cables not required for commercial purposes but required by those Governments to be retained for strategic reasons.(5)    The transfer to the Company of certain Anglo-Continental telegraphic services operated by the G.P.O.(6)    Powers of the Advisory Committee to be modified and the United Kingdom Government to appoint three new Government Directors to the Board of the Company.2. Naturally on the communication of such radicalrecommendations to the Empire Governments and on their further exploration by the Committee of Imperial Defence and with the Company some adjustments had to be made.On recommendation No.  (5) (Anglo-Continental Telegraphic Services) the Postmaster-General reserved his view at the Cabinet and a modified arrangement satisfactory to him is expected shortly to be reached.Recommendation No. (4) (Strategic Cables) was found to be entirely unacceptable to the Dominions and in certain respects also impracticable.     This suggestion has therefore been dropped.     The Company will r-remain under the obligation to maintain these cables as at present, on the understanding that, after 5 years, they may raise again the question of compensation, but  . without the Governments being committed in any way to grant such compensation.   . With the agreement of the Prime Minister I have consented, mainly by reason of
this liability but partly also because during the progress of the negotiations the Company have paid the Wireless Beam annuity of  250,000 for an additional year,  to accept 2,600,000 share instead of 3,000,000 as the participation of the United Kingdom Government in the capital of the Companjr.As regards recommendation No.  (6) the Empire Governments were found to desire for political reasons that the Advisory Committee should continue with, its present powers.      At the same time during the progress of the negotiations the relations of the Company under its new Chairman, Mr.  Wilshaw, with the United Kingdom Government and the Dominion Governments have immensely improved and it is no longer necessary to contemplate so wide an addition of Government nominees to the Directorate.      While some additional Government representation upon the Board is contemplated, the details have not yet been worked out. difficulty is.likely to be experienced in reaching an appropriate unders tanding.3. Except upon this last point the proposals as modified above have with the approval of the Prime Minister been communicated to the Dominion Governments whose early agreement is expected;    if it is given without delay,  I hope that it may be practicable to introduce the new schedule of reduced rates for Empire messages on the 1st January next.      The initial cost to the Company of these reductions is estimated at over  400,000 per annum, of which the lion&apos;s share will benefit the Colonies and the United Kingdom.
4,. It will be necessary shortly to lay a white Paper and to introduce the requisite legislation. While discussion may be expected it should not be   , difficult to meet.      Under the modified settlement we are relieved of the necessity to seek power to pay compensation to the Company for the maintenance of strategic cables.(Intld. )     J. S.Treasury Chambers, S. W. l, ?th October, 1937,
