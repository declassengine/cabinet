THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S GOVERNMENTPALESTINE;    THE HIGH OOM&amp;ISSIONSRSHIP. MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES.As my colleagues are aware,  the measures sanctioned by the Cabinet against the Arab Higher Committee in Palestine have been duly carried into effect.      It is, of course, much, too early to speak with any confidence as to the result, but so far as present indications show a decidedly salutary impression has been produced.      It is,, however, clearly essential, as I have informed the Acting High Commissioner,  to allow no relaxation of preventive and repressive action against terrorism and disorder until confidence in the strength and determination of the Government has been completely re-established. 2,      It will be necessary, as soon as the situation is a little clearer, to frame proposals for a constructive policy based upon (l) the Cabinet&apos;s acceptance in principle of the main recommendations of the Royal Commission and (2) the authority obtained from the Council of the League of Nations to proceed with the further investigation of the question of partition. 3.      I propose in due course .to submit considered recommendations to the Cabinet with this object. Meanwhile a personal question of great difficulty and delicacy seems to me to arise.      Is it desirable that the task of carrying through the new policy should be entrusted to the present High Commissioner, or are the circumstances such as to call for new methods and a new personality?TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.MOST SECRET.COPY NO.CP.  252(37).CABINET.
4. Sir Arthur Wauchope assumed office as HighCommissioner for Palestine in November,  1931. ,   His original appointment was for five years, but his terra of office was subsequently extended and will not come to an end,   in normal circumstances, until November 1941.-     I should remind my colleagues that he could have had the offer of the important Governorship of Malta, but he preferred to carry through his half-completed tasks in Palestine.      Sir Arthur is well known to some of my colleagues,   and I believe held in high esteem by them. His oersonal qualities and character,  as I am glad to testify, call for unqualified respect and admiration. There can be no doubt that,   in the earlier years of his High Commissionership, he was conspicously successful. His reputation as a straightforward British soldier was admirably qualified to influence the people over whom he was called upon to rule.      His tactful and conciliatory methods    coupled with a genuine kindness of heart,  and unstinting generosity,  endeared him to all the diverse elements of the country, and seemed, before the trouble came,  to have established him in an inroregnable position. His good qualities were just those which were suited to carry out the then policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government. If his term of office had ended before the disturbances of 1936 it would unquestionably have been reckoned an outstanding success.      As has so often happened in our history, an extension of his period of office has turned out unluckily for the individual concerned. 5. There is a passage in the Report of the RoyalCommission which has been widely interpreted as reflecting
upon the High Commissioner&apos;s conduct of affairs during the troubled period.      The Commissioners quote Sir Arthur Wauchope as having recorded the view (which no one will dispute) that &quot;the first of all conditions necessary for the welfare of any country is public security.&quot;     They go on to say that &quot;today it is evident that the elementary duty of providing public security has not been discharged&quot;. I should wish to say at once that this criticism,  in so far as it is to be regarded as a personal reflection upon Sir Arthur Wauchope, cannot,  in my opinion, be substantiated. The policy of &quot;extreme conciliation&quot; towards the Palestine malcontents has been severely criticised in many quarters; but whether it was right or wrong, wise or unwise,  it was at least a policy deliberately adopted by the Government at home, on a full consideration of all the circumstances. The High Commissioner did no more than carry out his instructions with complete loyalty and fidelity.      The responsibility for the policy of conciliation rested not with him, but with those under whose orders he was acting. 6. It follows that,  so far as the past is concerned,I acquit Sir Arthur Wauchope of all blame for any evil results that may have ensued from the policy of the Government.      Indeed,  I have already made this quite clear, both in the House of Commons and in my evidence before the Permanent Mandates Commission at Geneva.      But what I am now asking the Cabinet to consider is not the past, but the future.    For immendiate purposes we have to deal with the whole situation in Palestine in a spirit and by methods very different from those that have hitherto prevailed.
It is possible that from this point of view the very-qualities that contributed to the High Commissioners outstanding success in past years may militate against his future efficiency..7. I know that several members of the RoyalCommission felt serious doubts whether it was desirable in the public interest that Sir Arthur T/auchope should remain in his present post.    In at least one case the feeling went far beyond mere doubt.   Information has reached me from quarters that I cannot ignore indicating that the High Commissioner has lost the confidence of both Jews and Arabs.    I have also received representations, from sources that I cannot disregards  indicating that, for the time being at any rate9 he has forfeited the confidence of British officials in Palestineo    It is9 I need not say9 highly distasteful to me to write in these terms about so distinguished and devoted a public servant. But the times are critical and menacing.,  and I should be failing in my duty if I did not put all these considerations fully and frankly before my colleagues.8. The moment is not one for half measures.   V/ehave got to.make it clear9 both to Jews and to Arabs, and indeed in all quarters, not only that we are fully determined to repress sedition and to maintain order., but also that our very real Imperial interests in Palestine,, with all the strategic importance that arises from its geographical position., are going to be permanently safeguarded against all comers.9.        My personal conclusion is that the question of .a change
in the High Commis si onership must be taken into serious consideration.      I repeat that this implies no reflection upon Sir Arthur Wauchope&apos;s past record, which I have already defended and shall continue to defend to the best of my ability.      But changing circumstances call for new methods. I am inclined to take the view that we must have a new man, and above all a man who will start work without the handicap of a Palestinian &quot;past&quot;o10.      If a change is thought desirable by the Cabinet, I should decidedly prefer a civilian to a soldier, and, if possible, a civilian with administrative experience overseas. My preference for a civilian is prompted in part by considerations arising out of the general principles that govern Colonial administration.   It is a widely recognised practice, which I am sure none of my colleagues would wish to see modified, that the initiative in matters of policy should come not from Downing Street but from the Governor on the spot.      This implies no derogation of the powers of the Secretary of State,  it is with him that the final decision and final responsibility must always resto Nor does it mean that circumstances may never arise in which the Secretary of State may find it necessary to prescribe in general lines a policy for the guidance of the Governor in the discharge of his duties.      But in all matters of day to day administration, and in many questions of policy, the initiative must come from the Governor^    He must not regard himself merely as the instrument for carrying out the instructions of superior authorityc     I believe that this essential principle is likely to be
better implemented by a civilian than by a soldier;    and it is for this reason in the main that I favour the appointment of a civilian High Commissioner in Palestine. Ihave afurther point in this connection.      It may well be that the Civil Administration in Palestine may have to hand over full powers to the General Officer Cammanding. This Is a very much easier matter for a Civilian High Commissioner than for a soldier, especially if of military rank senior to that of the General Officer Commanding. Indeed the general relationship between the head of a Civil Administration and the Officer in command of the military forces is more likely to be satisfactory where the former is a civilian.11. The question of method is not easy.      Sir arthur wauchope is the most loyal of men, and his sense of military discipline is of the highest.      There can be no question that Sir Arthur Wauchope would be greatly surprised and deeply hurt if the Government were now to ask for his resignation.      Both publicly and privately since his appointment as High Commissioner the confidence of Government in him and his administration has been frequently expressed.      The task of conveying to him a decision, inviting him to resign would not be an agreeable one, but it would perhaps be made easier by a frank explanation of the circumstances as outlined in this memorandum, ending with an intimation that for reasons of high public policy, in no way reflecting upon Sir Arthur Wauchope personally,  the Cabinet had come to the conclusion that the best hope of inaugurating a new regime lay in the appointment of a civilian High Commissioner.      I should have
o, n n, 600wished, if it had been possible, to couple this intimation with the offer of a new appointment elsewhere, but it is difficult to see where a suitable vacancy can be found. There is none in the Colonial Empire.     An Australian Governorship had occurred to me, but I understand that there is none available.      I should welcome any suggestions from my colleagues on this point.12.       I think the Cabinet should realize that there will be public criticism whatever course we take. If Sir Arthur wauchope remains in office, we shall he accused of continuing a regime which has proved a failure. If we ask Sir Arthur Fauchope to resign, we shall be charged with throwing over an honourable public servant because a policy for which we here must accept responsibility has ended in failure.(Intd.) W.O.G.olonial Office,8th October, 1937.
