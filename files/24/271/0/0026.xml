THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTSECRET.D.P.R. 219.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements.GERMAN t ANTI-AIRCRAFT DEFENCES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE herewith a despatch from His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires at Berlin which gives a remarkable picture of the effectiveness of German anti-aircraft defences. My colleagues will, I feel sure, agree that Sir G. Ogilvie-Forbes has rendered most valuable service in setting out the impressive record of Germany&apos;s efforts to protect herself against air attack, efforts which have been so far successful that, in the words of the despatch, &quot; there can be few countries which can anticipate attacks from the air with such comparative confidence as Germany.&quot;A. E.Foreign Office, September 6, 1937.Sir G. Ogilvie-Forbes to Viscount Halifax. (Received August 27.) (No. 757.)My Lord, Berlin, August 18, 1937.I HAVE read with great interest the report compiled by Major F. L. Fraser, M.C., and Mr. H. Ryle, M.V.O., O.B.E., upon their recent visit to Berlin for the purpose of inspecting the German system of air protection. The picture which it presents of German organisation in this sphere is truly impressive, and it is plain that there can be few countries which can anticipate attack from the air with such comparative confidence as Germany.2. It is particularly to this point that I wish to draw your Lordship&apos;s attention. In measuring that parity in the air with any Power within striking-distance, which Lord Baldwin laid down as the basic principle of British air policy, the average layman is apt to be content with statistical details as regards numbers and types of aeroplanes. The air attache to this Embassy points out, however, that any calculations based on such figures must be totally misleading if applied to Germany. Air parity is not in fact to be measured in terms of aircraft, but only by a careful balance of striking poAver and defence. For this reason I entirely agree with the air attache&apos;s opinion that the state of affairs disclosed by Major Fraser&apos;s and Mr. Ryle&apos;s report is one which calls for a radical readjustment of existing theories in regard to Germany&apos;s power in the air.3. To complete the picture of German Air Defence given in the report it should be explained that Germany has based her system of protection upon three separate lines, of which actual passive precautions such as are dealt with in the report above referred to are but the third. The first line consists of fighter aircraft, whose functions and possibilities are already well known in Great Britain. The second line is the anti-aircraft artillery. The duty of this arm is to destroy the invader if the fighters fail. Group Captain Don informs me that Germany is immeasurably superior to her neighbours in this respect. There 9465   [15819]   [15929]
are over thirty regiments of regular anti-aircraft troops who do a minimum of two years&apos; continuous service, while the local defence of factories and other vital areas by reservist territorial formations is rapidly being organised. German officers claim that under ideal conditions 18 per cent, of hits can be achieved upon targets at a high altitude of the average battery. That this claim is not an idle one nearly all reports upon the German batteries now serving in Spain go to prove. Indeed, the German anti-aircraft artillery on General Franco&apos;s side is everywhere credited in local talk with being deadly efficient. As such it may be taken for granted that the danger to attacking formations from this cause will be very great indeed.4. The third line of defence is that described in Major Fraser&apos;s and Mr. Ryle&apos;s report. Its efficiency, both as regards the &quot;blacking out&quot; of towns, the placing of the population under bomb and gasproof protection, and the organisation of repair and relief services is beyond the slightest question. Moreover, its importance in preventing or minimising the disorganisation and panic which an air raid might normally be expected to cause, by means of the stranglehold upon civilian discipline which its huge organisation gives it, can scarcely be over-estimated. I reproduce below the comparative table illustrating the state of passive air defence in Germany and Great Britain attached to Major Fraser&apos;s report.   Its figures are eloquent.Heading.Air force (a).A. ArtilleryAir ProtectionAir Protection LeagueExtent of propagandaGermany.

Every    large   building    or group of small houses has its own trained and equipped emergency fire squad5. I have mentioned above the three lines of German defence, and I think it important to emphasise here that, widely different though their functions are, all three are under the direct control of the Air Ministry. In my opinion and in that of Group Captain Don, this fact has played a vital part in securing the efficiency of the whole organisation.6. There are, however, other features of the German scheme which must be appreciated : (a) In this totalitarian State, discipline is automatic whether amongindividuals or organisations. (&amp;) Similarly, the necessary legislation has, of course, been promulgated andthe voluntary side of the system is only preserved sufficiently to givethe added impetus of keenness to the members of the Air ProtectionLeague.(c) No expense has been spared by the State, though local authorities havealso subscribed.(d) Propaganda has been applied on a scale which it is impossible to under-stand outside this country.(e) Men over military age and women have been largely enlisted in the AirProtection League, which has been in being for several years and now has over 12 million members. Indeed time is an essential element in air defence, and one of the lessons to be learnt from Germany is that, even under this regime, efficient organisation requires several years of large-scale preparation.7. To return to my first thesis, it will, I am sure, be appreciated that, faced by this formidable mechanism of defence, any forces which Great Britain might be obliged to despatch against this country would produce a far less staggering-impact than might at one time have been hoped. Not only (this, but the curve of their decline in offensive power as the defence took its inevitable toll would be a rapidly progressive one. On the other hand, taking Major Fraser&apos;s Report as a basis, it is reasonable to suppose that the German squadrons, even if they were no more than equal in speed and in striking power to our own at the outset, would achieve far more dangerous results and would continue to do so for an indefinitely longer period. Such a state of affairs is one which is grievous to contemplate, but which appears nearly inevitable unless full account be speedily taken of the enormous advantage which Germany possesses in her protective organisation.I have, &amp;c.GEORGE OGILVIE-FORBES.Refuges to be selected.None yet existing.All householders are advised to provide a gas protected room.All purely voluntary.Plans being prepared.
