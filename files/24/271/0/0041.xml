secret .P. 241(37)cabinet copy HoCRE.IIIIAL LAW AltD PROCEDURE (SCOTLAND) AlZEITOiEIlTBILL.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland.1.I desire authority to prepare and submit to the Committee of HomeAffairs a Bill making certain amendments in the Criminal law in Scotland, -whichexperience has suggested to be desirable.I propose in the first place that Courts in Scotland should beauthorised to order the payment of fines by instalments and that consideration shouldbe given to the application to Scotland of certain other provisions of the Honey Paymentssuccessfully in England and I am satisfied that the time has come to extend the system to Scotland.     The application of other provisions of the Act of 1935 is subject to adjustment with representatives of local authorities who will have to ibe consulted,-I do not anticipate that the proposals will be controversial but if any of them raise points of substance I shall call the attention of the Home Affairs Committee to them specially in circulating the draft Bill.3. I have also had under consideration, in consultation with the lord advocate, the question of legislation to meet a number of miscellaneous difficulties which have arisen in the administration of the criminal law. The main points which require to be dealt with are as follows:-(l)     In a recent case in the High Court of Justiciary it was held that the supplying of drugs, etc, to a woman in the belief that she is pregnant and with intent to procure abortion, and instigating her to use than, is not a crime according to the 5-8-w of Scotland.     It is proposed to make it an offence, as it already is in England.(2)     Under Section 37 of the Road Traffic Act, 1934-, it is already competent to include in the indictment for certain offences other offences under the Act which &apos;ould otherwise have to be tried summarily.     It is proposed to make it possible, under similar conditions, to include in the indictment offences under Regulations made under fee Act.-(Justices Procedure) Act, 1935.he payment of fines by Instalments has operated
(-3)     In Summary criminal proceedings, where the accused person, does not appearthe &quot;pleading diet&quot; (i.e. the preliminary hearing),, the practice which has to he isqpted/to get a warrant for apprehensions Yfliile the attendance of the accused is ually arranged for without enforcing the Warrant, it would be desirable, in cases ere the accused resides at a distance from the Court,to allow him to intimatethe prosecutor in writing, or by the appearance of a Solicitor at the &quot;pleading et&quot;, that he pleads not guilty.     Statutory authority for this is necessary.(4)     In a recent case in the High Court of Justiciary it was held that, where statute requires or authorises a sentence of penal servitude, the High Court alone s jurisdiction to try the case even though the offence warrants only a sentence of iaprisonment.     In cases where the circumstances are such that a sentence of srisonment is obviously adequate, it may be desirable that proceedings should be &apos;cen in the Sheriff Court, and it is proposed to make this possible.     Prior to e decision referred to, such cases were in fact frequently taken in the Sheriff urt.     That Court will not, of course, be. empowered to award penal servitude.(5)     Section 42(2)(a) of the Criminal Justice Administration Act, 1914, requiresourt to allow time for payment of a fine, unless, inter alia, the accused has noed abode within its jurisdiction.     It is proposed to repeal this limitation.the accused has a fixed abode, it should not matter whether it is within orhout the jurisdiction of the Court.W.E.E.tish Office, Yftiitehall, S-W.1.15th October, 1937.
