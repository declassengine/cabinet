THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1937.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 284 (37).CABINET.SPAIN.I CIRCULATE herewith to my colleagues the text of the joint Anglo-French note of the 2nd October proposing tripartite conversations to consider the withdrawal of foreign volunteers from Spain, as well as the text of the Italian reply thereto of the 9th October.A. E.Foreign Office, October 11, 1937.   -Joint Anglo-French Note of October 2, 1937.THE Governments of France and the United Kingdom have noted with pleasure that as a result of the conversations which have taken place in Paris between their naval experts and those of the Italian Government it is now possible to contemplate the modification, of the arrangement signed at Nyon on the 14th September in such a manner as to secure the participation of Italy in the measures agreed upon for rendering the arrangement effective. Favourable conditions are thus created to enable the three Governments to examine in a spirit of perfect frankness the situation arising from the prolongation of the Spanish conflict.The two Governments have, moreover, noted with satisfaction the assurances given by his Excellency Count.Ciano to the British Charge d&apos;Affaires in Rome that there was no present intention of permitting the despatch of further volunteers to Spain. They have also taken note of the declaration made to M. Delbos by the Italian delegate at Geneva that Italy had no intention of making the smallest change in the territorial status of Spain; that she had no designs upon the Balearic Islands and that the integrity of the continental and insular territory of Spain would be strictly respected. For their part the two Govern-ments willingly renew the same,assurances to the Italian Government. They further desire to declare that, in accordance with what is the very essence of the non-intervention agreements, they consider themselves bound to respect the political independance of Spain.The Governments of France and the United Kingdom earnestly desire that the civil strife in Spain shall cease to be a cause of international unrest and suspicion and that in that part of Europe conditions shall develop which shall permit of progress being made elsewhere towards general appeasement. But they are convinced that no considerable improvement in the situation is possible until further measures have been carried out to make the policy of non-intervention effective by the withdrawal of the non-Spanish nationals who are now taking part in the struggle. So long as large numbers of foreigners continue to assist both sides,, the risk of grave international disturbances will be present and will inevitably tend to increase until at least a substantial number are withdrawn.9513   [15961]
The London; Committee has, of course, been, already apprised of this programme, but,the difficulties it has come up against have practically paralysed its action, and it appears that a previous agreement between the three Powers is necessary to overcome these obstacles. The view of the two Governments is that the elaboration of:-such.an agreement should form one of the essential elements Of the frank and cordial conversations to which they invite the Italian Government. Moreover, greatly as the French; and United; Kingdom Governments desire to maintain the obligations which they have undertaken resulting from the inter-national agreements respecting the supply,of arms and men to Spain, they cannot conceal from themselves the difficulty of preserving these conditions unless some such steps are taken to make the policy of non-intervention really effective.With this end in view, the.French and United Kingdom Governments have the honour to invite the Italian Government to join with them in conversations with the object, if possible, of reaching an agreement on measures to carry this policy into effect. In their view, such an agreement would not only make an important contribution to the improvement of the political situation, but once such a withdrawal has been effected the question of the recognition on certain conditions, of belligerent rights to the two parties should be capable of solution. It is the earnest desire of the two Governments that these conversations, to which they attach the utmost importance, should be held at the earliest possible moment..... n.: Reply of the Italian Government of October 9, 1937.THE Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs have the honour to refer to the communication of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Embassy dated the 2nd instant.The Fascist Government willingly take note of the assurances furnished by the British Government regarding the political independence of Spain. For themselves they do not need to recall the assurances furnished on repeated occasions, in the most solemn fashion, regarding the political independence and consequently the territorial integrity of Spain, its mainland, its islands and its colonies.The Fascist Government fully share the hope expressed by the British Government that the internal struggles of Spain may cease to be a cause of suspicion and friction between the other nations and that the situation may evolve in such a manner that in other fields also progress may be realised towards a general detente. They are ready with every possible goodwill to examine, as they have always done in the past, all means which may be thought suitable to render effective the policy of non-intervention.Among the elements constituting this policy the British Government lay particular emphasis upon the question of the volunteers and their withdrawalNevertheless, in order to indicate clearly the individual political positions and the responsibilities deriving from them, and not for any untimely emphasis of polemic, it is opportune to recall how it was actually Italy, together with Germany, who was the first to draw attention to the question of volunteers, and to insist that their despatch should be forbidden, and subsequently that provisions should be taken for their withdrawal. The Italian Government claim for themselves and for the German Government the merit of the initiative directed towards the consideration of this question as one of the indispensable elements of any policy of non-intervention. In so far as they themselves are concerned, they recall the explicit declaration made to the French Ambassador by the Italian Foreign Minister so long ago as August 1936, to the declarations obtained in the note verbale of the 7th January last addressed to the Embassies of Great Britain and France, to that of the 25th January last addressed only to the Embassy of Great Britain, and finally to the repeated declaration made by the Italian repre-sentative on the Committee of Non-intervention in London on the occasion of the last discussion of this question.The Fascist Government have the honour to confirm that, so far as concerns the whole question of non-intervention, in its various aspects and elements, they maintain the same order of ideas as that which emerges from all the above-mentioned declarations.
In their communication of the 2nd instant, the British Government suggest that conversations should be initiated between the three Governments of France, England and Italy for the purpose of reaching, if possible, agreement on measures designed to ensure the application of the policy of non-intervention.&apos; &apos;     !The British Government suggest such a procedure with the intention of obviating the difficulties which have&apos; occurred at the London Committee.    : &apos; &apos;The Fascist Government appreciate in all its value1 the British suggestion, &apos; but doubt whether the difficulties in question can be overcome by way of ingenuities or device of procedure and, above all, by that proposed. They draw the attention of the British Government to the fact that the matter under discussion does not regard some States alone; but, on the contrary, directly interests other States besides France, Great Britain and Italy. Further, the fact should not be overlooked that, without the adherence of Burgos and Valencia, any decision on the question would fail to lead to practical results. All the more so when one remembers the attitude of the representative of Valencia, who, by his specious pretext, excluded in his speech in Geneva any possibility of the evacuation of the volunteers enrolled in the armed forces of his Government. The proposed discussion, in the absence of the other States, would lack the elements indispensable for reaching an agreement. It is the conviction of the Fascist Government that the adoption of procedures even if only preliminary-outside the London Committee and its organs would in the present situation result not only in not diminishing, but in increasing, the possibility of misunderstandings and complications and in retarding, instead of hastening, the attainment of the general agreement, an agreement which the Fascist Government regard as supremely necessary.The Fascist Government are therefore of the opinion that the question of non-intervention should continue to be dealt with at the London Committee.The Fascist Government have finally the honour to state that they will not participate in conversations, meetings or conferences to which the German Government have not been formally invited and in which they do not participate.
