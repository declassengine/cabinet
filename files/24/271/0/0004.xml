(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 a GOVERNMENT).COPY No.SECRET.CP.  No.   20U/37.CABINET india appreciation of the Political Situation, &quot;by. the Government of India,  dated 19th August, 1937.Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential appreciation of the political situation in India,  dated the 19th August, 1937,  issued on the authority of the Secretary of State for India.North West Frontier.      There have &quot;been no large scale operations in Waziristan during the past month.    A number of irreconcilahles   have, however, been giving trouble by sniping and attacks on piquets and it has not been possible to make any substantial reduction in the number of troops employed.    The most serious incident which took place during the month was an attack on a camp-piquet at Asman Manza on July 13th, when a party of the enemy estimated at 30 strong threw two bombs into the piquet and killed or wounded 16 out of a garrison of 17 and subsequently looted the piquet.2.    The Faqir of Ipi has remained during the greater part of the month in caves in an inaccessible part of the country close to the Mahsud Bhitannis border.    He has received many visitors and has been supplied with cash and grain from the Bannu District and elsewhere.    His lair was bombed for a few days at the beginning of this month and on or about August 5th he moved to Mandech,  a village west of Razmak where the well-known pro-Afghan tribal leader Musa Khan resides.    He has been joined there by other hostile leaders and it is believed that Musa Khan,  at the instance of the Afghan Government, may be endeavouring to induce them to make peace.    The Afghan Government are -interested in the matter as the Waziristan disturbances have had repercussions in their territory and they are now facing fairly serious trouble with some of the Sulaiman Khel Ghilzais in Katawaz.The situation in the Bhitannis country is not altogether satisfactory and gangs are still reported to be
seeking for opportunities for mischief in settled districts. On the night of the lst/2nd August, pai Khel,  a village in the Tank sub-division, was raided by a small gang and one Hindu vroman was captured and one Hindu wounded.    The exact identity of the gang is not known but the kidnapped woman is reported to be with the Bhitannis.    Work on the new roads in the Shaktu area is progressing and is being carried out partly by tribal labour.    The terms -to be announced to the tribes concerned in the disturbances are still under consideration;  it is hoped that it will be possible to &apos;announce them shortly.3.    Congress ministries.      In pursuance of the decision of the &quot;Working Committee of the All-India Congress Committee, Congress ministries have been formed in 6 of the Provinces in which the Congress parts?- has a majority in the legislature and meetings of the legislatures have been held for the transaction of formal business.The budgets for next year are now due for consideration and the ministries are facing the problem familiar in democracies of carrying out their election promises.    The most pressing difficulty is finance.    The promised reforms in education and other matters will mean greatly increased expenditure while the introduction of prohibition (now to be attempted in parts of some Provinces and announced as the aim-to be achieved in all Provinces within 3 years) and the remission of land tax (which in most of the Provinces was part of the election programme) will mean a serious fall in revenue.k-    One expedient that has been put forward to bridge the gap is a reduction in the salaries of public servants. For the present this is spoken of as an appeal for a voluntary sacrifice of pay but intimations have not been lacking in some
3.Provinces of compulsion as a possible resort if the response to the appeal is not adequate.    This proposal is based on the view that the existing scales of pay of Government servants are excessive,  at any rate for Indians serving in their own country: against this has to be set -the danger to the integrity,  confidence and efficiency of the Services that would result from mulcting officers already in employment.The ministers themselves,  in accordance with the Congress principle often affirmed,  that Rs.  500 a month is as much as any servant of the public should receive, have fixed this sum (which is very much less than the amount hitherto drawn by official and non-official members of Provincial Governments) as their own remuneration -with,  however,  additional allowances for house rent and motor cars.5.    In some Provinces where tenancy conditions have promoted controversy and discontent,  the Congress ministries have to redeem promises of indulgences to tenants which are proving difficult and liable to alienate powerful interests.6.    The final decision to allow acceptance of office was only taken on express condition of centralised control by the Working Committee.    Provincial Premiers have recently met the Central Working Committee at Wardha to discuss the co-ordination of policy.    The decisions are not yet fully known but inter-provincial collaboration has been prescribed for conditions,  e.g.  in irrigation and agricultural questions, affecting more provinces than one.Meanwhile the President (Mr. Jawaharlal  Nehru) publicly insists on observance of the pledges - somewhat difficult to reconcile with constructive administration -
that all Congress men shall work for the defeat of the Constitution,  in particular to prevent Federation; and for its replacement by a Constitution framed by a constituent assembly.7.    &quot;Political&quot; prisoners.    The release of so-called political prisoners has always been a prominent item in the Congress Party programme.    The new Congress iiinistries have generally withdrawn prosecutions for sedition and have released persons convicted of sedition.    They have also withdrawn the ban imposed on certain Associations and have ordered the refund of security taken from certain individuals and newspapers.    The main point of the controversy,  however, concerns the prisoners convicted or detained for acts of violence or conspiracy to commit acts of violence. Congress Ministries have shown a commendable disposition to examine each case on its merits and not to order an indiscriminate jail delivery; but the vast majority of these prisoners belong to Bengal where the non-Congress Government, while pledged to the gradual release of persons under detention,   is alive to its responsibilities for the maintenance of law and order and the dangers of premature release.A number of terrorist convicts, mostly from Bengal,  are confined at Port Blair in the Andaman Islands: and the great majority of these have been on hunger strike since 20th July to enforce their demands,  primarily, for repatriation,  secondly,  for release of all &quot;political&quot; prisoners,  repeal of all &quot;repressive&quot; legislation,  and similar catchwords.of extremism.      Sympathetic hunger strikes have started in some jails on the mainland.      The Andaman settlement is condemned as a &quot;Devil1s Island&quot; - a strangely inapposite term since (apart from terrorist
5.prisoners, less than 300,  confined in jail there) the settlement consists of over 5,000 convicts,  who have gone there at their own desire and serve their sentences under conditions which have most of the.elements of freedom: the terrorist prisoners are men convicted of murder (or attempt or conspiracy to murder) or of gang robbery or of illegal possession of firearms or explosives,  the common feature being the intent to overthrow the Government by violence.8.      The Governor-General and Mr.  Gandhi.      On his return from a tour.to Assam,  the Governor-General granted an interview to Mr.  Gandhi at Delhi.    This meeting caused great satisfaction throughout India.9.    Moslems and Congress.      The drive to draw the Moslem communities into the Congress fold continues but without noticeable success and in some Provinces great difficulty has been experienced in securing suitable Moslems for inclusion in Congress Cabinets.    The lure of office has, however,  induced certain Moslems to leave the Moslem League and to join Congress,  though their failure to resign and seek re-election on the Congress ticket has caused adverse comment.      The Moslem League candidate defeated the Congress candidate in the by-election of which mention was made in the last appreciation.- 10.    Labour.    A serious strike took place in the textile mills in Cawnpore during the month.      A settlement reached through intervention of the Congress Premier of the United provinces was repudiated by the workers; the moderate elements then lost control and communists engineered a general strike involving i+0, 000 workers.    Sporadic incidents of violence occurred &quot;but the Premier again
intervened and the strike is now over.II. Communal relations.    There was no serious communal trouble during the month,  though tension is apparent in the Punjab,  3ihar and North West Frontier Provinces and in Kashmir.12.    The Palestine report.    The report has been widely criticised in the press.    Moslem opinion has almost universally disapproved the recommendations of the commission and numerous meetings have been held and resolutions passed in condemnation.    Protest,  however,  is still unorganised and has perhaps lost some of its incentive for the time through the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government in suspending a positive decision.13.    Miscellaneous.    A disastrous railway accident&apos; occurred at Bihta in Bihar on July 17th.    An express train was derailed and over a 100 persons lost their lives.    An investigation is proceeding.III. General.    The past month has seen the transfer of power in 6 Provinces to a party which for many years has vigorously opposed established Government.    Difficulties in adjustment were inevitable and these.difficulties are proving more formidable in some of these Provinces than in others.    In the 5 non-Congress Provinces also conditions vary.    But in both categories there are examples which warrant optimism.
