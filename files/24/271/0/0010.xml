THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. September 1937.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 210 (37).CABINET.THE PRESENT PHASE IN ANGLO-ITALIAN RELATIONS, AND THE QUESTION OF THE FINAL RECOGNITION OF ITALIAN SOVEREIGNTY IN ABYSSINIA.. Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.Introduction: Historical.IT had been hoped that the joint declaration signed by the United Kingdom and Italy on the 2nd January last would have ushered in a new and better phase in Anglo-Italian relations. This hope has not been fulfilled. An atmosphere of suspicion and misunderstanding between Italy and the United Kingdom has unfortunately persisted.The continuance of this mutual suspicion led me to circulate, on the 15th June, to the Committee of Imperial Defence a memorandum entitled &quot; Probability of War with Italy,&quot; in which I put forward considerations to show that the formula on which we had been basing our defence preparations in regard to Italy, viz., that &quot; Italy cannot be counted on as a reliable friend, but in present circumstances need not be regarded as a probable enemy,&quot; no longer held good. On the 5th July, the Committee of Imperial Defence decided to recommend to the Cabinet that the formula should read &quot; that Italy cannot be considered as a reliable friend and must be omitted from the decision of the Cabinet on the 15th November, 1933, which says &apos; no expenditure should for the present be incurred on measures of defence required to provide exclusively against attack by the United States, France or Italy.&apos; &quot; This formula was approved by the Cabinet itself on the 14tih July.For some time past the Chiefs of Staff had been preoccupied with the importance, from the military point of view, of the restoration of our former friendly relations with Italy. In July 1936 they reported, for example, as follows : &quot; From the strategical point of view, the first desideratum is a secure Mediterranean. This involves, as a primary consideration, the restoration of our former friendly relations with Italy.&quot; As recently as the 12th August they stated in a report: &quot; Asa general proposition, anything which can be done at the present time to improve Anglo-Italian relations would be of the greatest advantage from the military point of view.&quot; In the Review of Imperial Defence which they prepared in February 1937 for use at the Imperial Conference, they again stated &quot;better relations with Italy should be our constant aim,&quot; and, later on in the same Review, &quot; our communications through the Mediterranean can only be made really secure either by maintaining friendship with Italy or by establishing ourselves in such military strength m the Mediterranean as would permanently deter Italy from embarking on war against us.&quot;It will thus be seen that in the view of the Chiefs of Staff an early restoration of friendly relations between the two countries is of great importance.At the same time reports from many sources that Italy was apprehensive that this country harboured feelings of&quot; revenge towards her led me to make a 9461   [15803] b
2speech in the House of Commons on the 19th July, in the course of which I stated that, while His Majesty&apos;s Government were determined to defend their own interests, they had no intention of challenging those of others. That was why His Majesty&apos;s Government had concluded the declaration of January last. They stood by that agreement, and there was room in the Mediterranean for all. HLe 0 added that this country had no intention &quot; of pursuing towards any other country a policy either of aggression or of revenge .... the word &apos; vendetta&apos; has no English equivalent.&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government wished to live in peace and friendship with their neighbours in the Mediterranean.On the 21st July I had a conversation with the Italian Ambassador, in which the latter said that the speech I had made in the House of Commons on the 19th July had had an excellent press in Italy. The situation seemed to be so much easier that he hoped the moment had come to communicate a message to the Prime Minister which Signor Mussolini had authorised him some time ago to make use of at his discretion. He then told me what Signor Mussolini had said. The Duce had emphasised his desire for permanent friendship with Great Britain. He regarded the agreement of the 2nd January as the frame, but the picture had yet to be filled in. He hoped that this would be done by further understandings defining closer relations between the two countries. Signor Mussolini had instructed him to repeat what had already been said many times, namely, that the Italian Government had no political ambitions whatever in Spain, still less, of course, any territorial ambitions. On the other hand, the Italian Government believed in General Franco, and desired his victory in order that Spain might be saved from the Bolshevik menace. He ended by saying that Signor Mussolini was at all times ready to discuss any proposals to further the interests of the two countries.The following day, the 22nd July, Count Grandi went to see the Secretary of State for War. He brought a message from Signor Mussolini, in his capacity as Minister of War, the gist of which was that Italy and His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment should agree to disclose to each other the nature of their defences in the Mediterranean area, the implication being that confidential relations should be established between the General Staffs. If such an agreement could be made, Count Grandi said, Italy would feel that she had a line of escape from &quot; the Germanic menace &apos;&apos; and a relationship of the character suggested would, from a military point of view, make for a re-establishment of the Stresa front. Count Grandi recalled the Protocol of the Triple Alliance, under which Italy was relieved of the necessity of entering a war against His majesty&apos;s Government. The above proposals, Count Grandi added, were put forward as a result of personal correspondence with Signor Mussolini, although there seems some reason to suppose that Count Grandi himself may be responsible for the actual form of the proposals. Meanwhile, the suggestion for an exchange of military information has been examined by the Chiefs of Staff, who are ready to entertain it within certain limits.  (Eeport of Chiefs of Staff C.I.D. Paper No. 1347-B.)On the 27th July Count Grandi delivered Signor Mussolini&apos;s message to the Prime Minister. As a result of that interview, the Prime Minister wrote a letter to Signor Mussolini, in which he welcomed the message sent him and assured him that His Majesty&apos;s Government were actuated only by the most friendly feelings towards Italy and would be.&quot; ready at any time to enter upon conversa-tions with a view to clarifying the whole situation and removing all causes of suspicion or misunderstanding.&quot; Signor Mussolini replied to this letter on the 31st July stating that he was glad to agree with the suggestion that &quot;conversations be entered upon in the course of which would have to be examined, in a spirit of sincere collaboration, those questions which still await a solution, in order to ensure the understanding we desire to re-establish between our two countries.&quot;When delivering, on the 27th July to the Prime Minister, Signor Mussolini&apos;s message and again on the 2nd August, when delivering to Mr. Chamberlain Signor Mussolini&apos;s reply to his letter, Count Grandi stressed the immense importance Signor Mussolini attached to the de jure recognition of Italy&apos;s position in Abyssinia. On the first of these occasions the Prime Minister replied that de jure recognition would give rise to very strong hostile criticism in this country. Such action could only be justified if His Majesty&apos;s Government could describe it as part of a great scheme of reconciliation which should remove suspicions and anxieties and lead to a restoration of confidence.    For this purpose, the
Prime Minister went on, a great deal more would be required than de jure recognition; His Majesty&apos;s Government would want to know why the Italian Government were sending an army corps to Libya and why the Italian press and wireless continued to abuse the United Kingdom. On the second occasion Count Grandi called the Prime Minister&apos;s attention to a press extract which stated that unless the Abyssinians were to send a delegation to Geneva or unless there was a special request to discuss the subject by one of the Governments at Geneva, there was no reason why it should be raised. The Ambassador stated that if the matter was not raised in September and the way thus free for Governments ultimately to recognise the Italian conquest de jure, &apos;&apos; he was afraid nothing further could be done for another year. On his side, Count Ciano informed His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Rome on the 3rd August that &quot; of course, the foundation for conversations would be and was the de jure recognition of Italy&apos;s sovereignty in Abyssinia.&quot;General Considerations.The importance which Signor Mussolini attaches to a formal recognition of his conquest has been confirmed from many different sources in the last few months. He has, for instance, consistently refused to allow the representatives of foreign countries to present letters of credence which do not include the words &quot; Emperor of Abyssinia &quot; after the words &quot; King of Italy,&quot; with the result that no less than seven countries are at present represented by Charge d&apos;Affaires in Rome. It may be argued that the value he attaches to such formal recognition is a disproportionate one, but it is known that he is particularly anxious to avoid a repetition of the Manchukuo precedent (see below), under which recognition has been indefinitely withheld, and that he regards formal recognition as of import-ance in connexion with the final pacification of his newly acquired East African territory. It may be interpolated here that, in the view of the War Office, the whole of Abyssinia is now in the effective occupation of the Italians, and that, failing external circumstances, their hold in that country is unlikely to be seriously threatened.It should perhaps be mentioned here that His Majesty&apos;s Government granted de facto recognition as long ago as last January when they withdrew their Legation from Addis Ababa and instituted a Consulate-General in its place. It should also be remembered that five countries, namely, Austria, Hungary, Germany, Switzerland and San Marino have already accorded full de jure recognition and that the following countries have taken action which might be regarded as according such recognition by implication: Chile, the Argentine, the Holy See, Yugoslavia, Albania, Guatemala and possibly Poland.The position may now be summarised as follows : The objective of His Majesty&apos;s Government is, as always, the general appeasement of the European situation, the chief disturbing factors in which are the two dictatorship countries Germany and Italy. Hitherto all attempts to get to closer quarters with Germany have failed and for the moment nothing more can be done in that quarter. In the case of Italy, however, my speech quoted above opened the way, and the correspondence between the Prime Minister and Signor Mussolini which followed it created momentarily at least an atmosphere favourable to further conversations. EAren, however, if formal recognition of the position of Italy in Abyssinia were contemplated, there would be no question of condoning acts of violence and bad faith by which Italy entered upon her conquest. But it would in any event be unnecessary to excuse these acts or to retract any resolutions already come to by the League. Indeed, it would be desirable, whenever the League was prepared to recognise the fact that Abyssinia had ceased to be an independent State, that the League should explicitly declare that no retraction from its previous attitude was implied. The important point in the view of the Italian Government is that the League should clear the way for the formal recognition of the facts by individual States if they so desire.It is recognised that any idea of according formal recognition of Italy&apos;s conquest of Abyssinia will be bitterly opposed both by the official Opposition and by many devoted adherents of the League in this country.It is therefore of the first importance that, if the course of recognising that Abyssinia has ceased to exist as an independent State is pursued, it should bef   [15803] b 2
properly presented, namely, as a contribution to the general pacification of Europe and not, as no doubt some critics will try to present it, as a nefarious bargain by which Italy gains our assent to her wrong-doing in return for material advantages to ourselves. Some advantages we shall gain no doubt, but the most important of them are not confined to the United Kingdom, but apply equally to all countries interested in the peace of Europe.The position, however, has undoubtedly been complicated in recent weeks by the activities of Italian submarines in the Mediterranean and by the intense irritation created by Signor Mussolini&apos;s message to General Franco on the fall of Santander. The records of my conversations with the French Charge d&apos;Affaires on the 30th August, the 2nd and 3rd September have been circulated. They show that we can count on little help from the French Government unless in the interval Italy herself makes-a contribution to peace by abandoning her piratical acts in the Mediterranean.Much, therefore, will depend upon the meeting of the Mediterranean Powers summoned for the 10th September at Geneva. We have insisted that Italy should herself be invited to this meeting, and we are in process of working out concrete proposals which, if they are accepted, should enable us to deal with the present situation. We have done our best to ensure that these proposals are such as Italy can reasonably accept, and would, in fact, give her a dignified means of retreat from her previous policy. If Italy is prepared to make the moderate contribu-tions which will be asked from her, and if, as a consequence, there is an improvement in the Mediterranean situation, the problem of Abyssinia&apos;s representation at Geneva, though still difficult, would assume much less formidable proportions. For instance, it may be taken for granted that if France saw a real chance of Mediterranean appeasement, she would be quite willing to make a contribution in the shape of recognising what are the facts of the Abyssinian situation. The attitude of the other Mediterranean Powers is likely to be similar. If, on the other hand, Italy refuses co-operation and rejects the proposals for meeting the submarine menace, then I fear that unless anything unforeseen happens there must inevitably be increased resentment at such an attitude. In such an atmosphere a proposal which, though it might in effect do no more than give an expression to the realities of the situation, would be interpreted as being friendly to Italy, would meet,with very strong opposition. In consequence, I would only suggest to my colleagues that the United Kingdom Delegation at Geneva shall be given a certain latitude in the situation; the objectives for which we would work would be to bring a successful issue to the conference of the Mediterranean Powers, to endeavour to make of such an issue the occasion for a real detente between Italy and France if this can be secured, when the co-operation of France and other Powers in finally resolving the Abyssinian problem should be forthcoming, and, together, we should be able to take a further step towards the final liquidation of the Abyssinian deadlock.I attach as annexes notes regarding the procedure at the meeting of the Assembly and the objectives of the Anglo-Italian conversations.A. E.September 2, 1937.
ANNEX I.Procedure at Meeting of Assembly of the League of Nations.The present Attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government.On the 28th July the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was asked in the House of Commons whether an assurance could be given that it was still the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to refuse recognition of the annexation of Abyssinia by Italy, or of the assumption by the King of Italy of the title of Emperor of Abyssinia. The Secretary of State replied that it was not possible for him to make a pronouncement on an issue which had not been raised and which if it were raised would be a matter to be considered by the League as a whole. Pressed for an assurance that there would be no initiative on the part of the Government to alter that policy until the House of Commons had had an opportunity of discussing it, the Secretary of State repeated that this was a matter for collective decision. It may be recalled that Mr. Baldwin said in the House of Commons on the 23rd June, 1936, in reply to a question whether His Majesty&apos;s Government intended to condone Italy&apos;s action: &apos; The answer to that is &apos; No&apos;; and in so far as it deserves recognition, I would emphasise that His Majesty&apos;s Government have no intention at the forthcoming meeting [i.e., July 1936] of the League to propose or assent to the recognition of Italy&apos;s annexation of Abyssinia.&quot;The Course of A ction at Geneva.There are two cases to consider: (a) If an Abyssinian Delegation presents credentials, the question will automatically be raised. In this event His Majesty&apos;s Government should press for the constitution of a strong Credentials Committee on which they and other leading Members of the League should be represented.(b) If an Abyssinian Delegation is absent, some special action will benecessary. It will be preferable in^that case to raise the question by a collective initiative in which His Majesty&apos;s Government would participate.Possible Difficulties at Geneva.(a) While a number of States are believed to favour an early settlement of the question of the position of Abyssinia, other States, e.g., Russia and Mexico, would be likely to make difficulties about de jure recognition, and the New Zealand Government have already informed His Majesty&apos;s Government that they would be definitely opposed to it.(b) Some small countries may be unwilling to agree to a decision that Abyssinia is no longer a Member of the League, in view of the possible bearing of such a decision on future disputes in which they personally might be involved.(c) In the course of the Sino-Japanese dispute the Assembly adopted, on the 11th March, 1932, a resolution in general terms declaring &quot; that it is incumbent on Members of the League of Nations not to recognise any situation, treaty or agreement which may be brought about by means contrary to the Covenant of the League of Nations.&quot; By this resolution the League adopted the doctrine of non-recognition which had been propounded by Mr. Stimson, the United States Secretary of State. At the same period the members of a Committee of the Council which had been appointed to follow the Sino-Japanese dispute made an appeal to the Chinese and Japanese Governments, in which they stated &quot; that no infringement of the territorial integrity and no changes in the political independence of any Member of the League brought about in disregard of Article 10 of the Covenant ought to be recognised as valid and effectual by the Members of the League of Nations.&quot; On the 16th December, 1936, the Secretary of State informed the House of Commons, in reply to a question, that His Majesty&apos;s Government adhered to the principle enunciated in this appeal, which was made in connexion with the particular case of the Sino-Japanese dispute, but in its application to any case His Majesty&apos;s Government must be entitled to take account of the facts of the situation and of the necessity, where the protection of
British interests was involved, of dealing with the actual authorities on the spot. Any such action on their part did not imply approval of the methods by which the situation was brought about. It is no doubt possible to adopt the same attitude in regard to the resolution of the Assembly, but it is not certain that other Members of the League, particularly certain South American countries, would be prepared to take the view that this resolution applied only to the particular case of Manchukuo. No resolution regarding non-recognition has been adopted by the League in the case of the: Italo-Abyssinian dispute, but, in its resolution of the 4th July, 1936, the Assembly declared that it remained firmly attached to the principles of the Covenant, which are also expressed in other diplomatic instruments such as the Declaration of the American States, dated the 3rd August, 1932, excluding the settlement of territorial questions by force. It may be contended that, while the hands of League Members are not tied in regard to the question of recognition in the present case as they were in the case of the Sino-Japanese dispute, any decision taken by the Assembly may not be without eventual influence on the question of Manchukuo. Recent developments in the Far East, which indicate the possibility that a situation similar to that in Manchukuo may be produced in the Northern provinces of China, naturally increase the significance of this point, but a distinction can, in fact, be drawn between the cases of Manchukuo and Abyssinia. Manchukuo was not in form conquered, but detached from China, and its recognition would imply not the recognition of Japanese sovereignty over it, but of the sham sovereignty of a puppet State. Further, China still exists and asserts her claim to sovereignty over Manchukuo, and may hope one day to re-establish her rights. In Abyssinia there has been a conquest, and there is no question of a recovery of Abyssinian authority or of rival claims.ANNEX II.Objectives of Anglo-Italian Conversations.So far as the Italians are concerned, our indications are that they expect us to supply the agenda for these conversations, although the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs is reported to have stated that he expected the conversations to cover Arabia, Red Sea and Indian Ocean affairs, and that as regards the Mediterranean, the January declaration covered the ground.On our side the main object of the conversations should be to ensure a general improvement in the relations between the two Governments, and in particular the cessation of tension in the Mediterranean area. In particular, His Majesty&apos;s Government would desire to obtain from the Italian Government a re-affirmation of their pledges, already given, regarding the maintenance of the status quo in Spanish territories, an assurance that all Italian volunteers will be withdrawn from Spain simultaneously with the withdrawal of volunteers on the Government side, and meanwhile to secure the evacuation of all Italians from the Balearic Islands. Secondly, to obtain an assurance that the Libyan garrison shall not exceed the 1934, i.e., normal, strength.We should expect the conversations to fall into two parts, the first dealing with Mediterranean and Near Eastern questions and the guarantees with regard to Abyssinia which the Italians might be disposed to give in return for de jure recognition; and the second dealing with matters connected with Abyssinian frontiers and British rights and interests in that country. As regards the former category, the subjects to be discussed should be, in addition to Spain and the Libyan garrison already mentioned : (a) The exchange of military information *;(b) The Bari broadcasts and anti-British propaganda generally in the press and elsewhere; &apos;* The Chiefs of Staffs have already expressed preliminary views on this point (see their report of the 12th August, C.I.D. Paper No. 1347-B), but if it is decided to proceed with this proposal it will be necessary to consult them further regarding their desiderata for these conversations, bearing in mind the possibility that the Italians might, in reply to any request on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government, put forward a reciprocal demand and thus possibly raise the issue of an arms limitation agreement.
(c) Italian activities in the Near East, with particular reference to the yemen and the Red Sea area;(d) The possibility of obtaining some assurances from the Italian Govern-ment that there should be no derogation from approved methods of colonial administration in Abyssinia, on the lines of the communica-tion of the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs to the League on the 27th June, 1936.The Abyssinian questions consist of the negotiation and conclusion of various agreements regarding the frontiers between Abyssinia on the one hand and Kenya, the Sudan and British Somaliland on the other, and in regard to Lake Tsana and British rights and interests in Abyssinia generally. These agreements will naturally take some time to negotiate, and Sir E. Drummond would require expert assistance during the negotiations.It should, however, be repeated that these detailed points relating to the Anglo-Italian Conversations are dependent on some prior action by the League which may tend to facilitate the granting, by His Majesty&apos;s Government and other Governments, of de jure recognition of the annexation of Abyssinia. This, in turn, is dependent on the atmosphere at Geneva, which must be governed by the events which may occur in the world in the fortnight which still separates us from the meeting of the Assembly. The events of the last four weeks are not encouraging. Signor Mussolini&apos;s telegram to General Franco on the occasion of the fall of Santander has undoubtedly embittered the situation. So has the action of Italian submarines against foreign merchantmen in the Mediterranean. The latter, at any rate, is to be raised at the Spanish request before the Council of the League, which meets on the days preceding the meeting of the Assembly. Things may be said there which may greatly exacerbate the position and destroy any possibility of recognition. The immediate future has never been more fluid and incalculable. It may, in the course of the next few days, become either better or worse. It is therefore impossible to say definitely what action it may be practicable to take at Geneva. While, therefore, recognising the desirability of settling this question of recognition at the present Assembly, if possible, I ask my colleagues for authority to use discretion in deciding what action at the Assembly is feasible and the manner in which such action should be initiated and carried out.
