THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1937.SECRET. Copy No.    ^2CP. 2m (37).CABINET.SPAIN.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues an appreciation of the situation in Spain written by Mr. G. H. Thompson, First Secretary at His Majesty&apos;s Embassy, first at Valencia and more recently at Hendaye, which I am sure they will be interested to read.:&apos;   / V .    / &apos; V 1    .     --.   A. E.Foreign Office, October 14, 1937.To return to the United Kingdom after some eight months or more spent in close contact with different phases of the Spanish war, first in Valencia and more recently in Hendaye, is to run the gamut of a great variety of emotions. Apart from the feeling of relief at escaping for a brief space from a madhouse into a sane world, one&apos;s chief sensation is one of amazement that notwithstanding all the resources open to them, small attempt is made by the leading organs of the press to educate public opinion on the threat to Great Britain and British interests, and indeed to all that for which we have struggled for generations, which it seems to me is daily growing out of the tragic events in the Peninsula.2. Before attempting to illustrate what I mean by the last statement I must record that as a servant of the Crown it has been my aim since I first landed in Spain at the end of January to view matters as objectively as possible. After a few weeks in Valencia my chief sentiment, was one of infinite sympathy for the well-nigh incredible sufferings of the people coupled with a horror of extremist brutality. When I first went to Valencia there were still &quot; private &quot; police and &quot;private&quot; prisons (our Spanish butler spent a fortnight in one of the latter) and rare was the night that passed without shots. Sometimes the remains of the previous night&apos;s &quot; bum ping-off &quot; party would still be lying in the dust by the river during one&apos;s morning stroll. In the middle of the night there would occasionally be, as the result of a wrong number, a mysterious telephone call: &quot; Open the doors! &quot; and in one&apos;s mind&apos;s eye would appear the not unfamiliar spectacle of five or six men slinking along the darkened streets to some unhappy doorway. During the late spring and early summer the position improved as the Government formed of men of very Left-Wing liberal tendencies, but neither assassins nor extremists fought the Anarchists and shot them down in hundreds, chiefly in Barcelona. Recently, Valencia&apos;s deteriorating fortunes and the increasing miseries of the population have led to a revival of repression and a renewal of the offensive against the so-called &quot;Fifth Column &quot; of supposed Nationalist sympathisers in Government territory, and the ever-present abuse of the anonymous denunciation has again come into its own.3.   After my transfer to Hendaye in June, my first short trips into Nationalist territory revealed, superficially, a very different state of affairs.  Here was plenty of food and here were many comforts : public services functioning 9529   [15982]
normally, no shortage of petrol, smartly-uniformed, and well-gowned society sipping its&apos;.cocktails in cafes and being waited upon by obsequious waiters; bull-fights, the Guardia Civil, daily (and, judging from the onlookers&apos;, faces, boring) religious processions and, in short, virtually all the concomitants of Spanish life, plus the presence of Italian and German officers and soldiery, But it did not take me many visits, nor the perusal of many reports,, nor many, conversations with foreigners who were out of Spain for a week or so of respite to find that there was another side to the picture -the spy,, the agent provocateur, the secret police, the denunciation as a suspected &quot; Red &quot; (and how easy it is to qualify as the latter!), the crowded prisons, the court-martial, the firing-party. Politically, just as the Valencia authorities have ceaselessly to struggle against the Anarchists, so has Franco to combat the &quot; Falange Espafiola,&quot; the Spanish Fascist organisation whose membership corresponds in type and class to that of the Federacion Anarquista on the other side. These men, the &quot; moppers-up &quot; of captured towns, so far tolerate Franco as a general, but declare he is not their ideal as the head of the State. There has already been street brawling with the Falange in Salamanca and elsewhere. If Franco wins he will have to shoot hundreds of them, just as Valencia have already liquidated large numbers of Anarchists.4. Except for more outward order, more colour and more ease (for some) in Nationalist Spain, there is little basic difference in the atmosphere there and in Government territory. There is the same repression, the same terror, the same (if slightly more legal) executions. But there is less tolerance, if such a thing be possible, than on the Valencia side, and what is even more disagreeable, a great absorption of Italian Fascist ideas and methods. Thus, none will interfere with you in Valencia if you do not salute with clenched fist when the band plays the &quot; Internationale,&quot; but Heaven help you if you fail, foreigner or no, to give the Fascist salute when the Colours come by in Franco Spain.5. Difficult though it be to predict what may happen in so divided a country as Spain, it is at least apparent that once the present war is over only a strong and merciless dictatorship will be able to govern. If Valencia should, by some miracle, gain the victory, this dictatorship must certainly, for some time at least, be Communist, because to-day the commands of the fighting forces are held by Communists under Russian leadership and inspiration. If, on the other hand, Franco wins, the difficulties with which he will certainly be confronted, coupled with the lack of driving force in the Spanish character, are likely to compel him to fall back upon foreign assistance in his attempts to maintain internal order. There are at present some 80,000 Italian troops, comprising two, or possibly three, regular divisions, with their artillery and ancillary services, in Spain. This figure does not include the Italian establishment at Majorca, or the Italian air forces operating from that base, and also, to a minor extent, on other fronts. As regards Germans, I should put the figure in Spain at from 8,000 to 10,000 men. In England we are too prone to comfort ourselves with the notion that these Germans (most people believe the numbers to be far less) are mere &quot; technicians.&quot; Technicians they certainly are the Nationalist air forces that smashed the iron ring of defences round Bilbao were almost entirely made up of German machines piloted by Germans. The final attack was launched by eighty of these bombers in the air at one time, and they created havoc. The German aviation groups have continued to play a leading part in the present Asturian campaign, both in bombing attacks on cities and in co-operation with ground troops. The anti-aircraft defences of Salamanca and Burgos are in the hands of very efficient German gunners. Germany is also represented by engineers, who repair bridges, operate the telegraph system and telephones, and mark out the highways. And, virtually, each time I drive past the docks at Pasajes, near San Sebastian, I see German merchant ships unloading war supplies. That the existence of the German air forces in Northern Spain is a source of anxiety to France is shown by the gradual establishment of anti-aircraft&apos; batteries along the Pyrenees frontier; there is one at the foot of the Embassy drive, on the cliff half-way between Hendaye and Saint-Jean-de-Luz.6. Since my return to England it has frequently been put to me that it would be contrary to Spanish character and sentiment to permit any foreign troops to remain in the country after the end of the war.   Similarly,. it has been
emphasised to me that no Spaniard would ever tolerate any cessions of territory to a foreign Power. While admittedly - &quot;all - Spaniards are in their hearts xenophobe, such generalisations seem to me very far from reality. Apart&apos; from the reason already given in paragraph 5 of this memorandum for the maintenance of a foreign garrison in the event Of a Franco victory, the Italian officers and officials-^the latter in the Propaganda Bureau and other offices-in Salamanca and Burgos and elsewhere in Nationalist territory, declare openly that they- -and Italy-are fighting not for Spain, but for themselves and for a new era. Democracies, they say, are everywhere decadent and at the root of all evil. The bitterness and hatred expressed against England, the conviction that this country is headed for disaster at their hands, are astonishing, but are not to be ignored. To the observer, Spain is but another Italian step in the direction of giving effect to the mare nostrum policy which began two years ago with the attack on Abyssinia. If this be so, and if we take it that the Spanish question is one of politico-strategic expansion by Italy, it will not be easy for Spain to show her friends the door. In such circumstances, negotiations about the withdrawal of &quot; volunteers &quot; are unlikely to succeed. In the first place, Italy (and Germany) cannot afford to let Franco lose. In the second place, Italy must get results if she is to prove to Germany the value and importance of her friendship. As the campaign is already behind schedule, greater efforts may be anticipated on Italy&apos;s part to achieve results, and Mussolini will not be deterred by the Non-Interven-tion Committee, the threatened opening of the French frontier (which in practice would mean little, since there has been- heavy traffic for months) or appeals to co-operate in restoring the Anglo-Italian friendship of yesterday. He is in my view pursuing a carefully planned objective, which, while he might hot be able to achieve it alone, he feels lies well within his powers with German, and possibly Japanese, help. An unpleasant feature of the present, situation is that the persistence with which Rome seeks her objectives, and the diplomatic success which she obtains, are calculated to impress not only the Mediterranean countries, but also Germany.7. Franco is between the devil and the deep sea; he certainly has nothing to gain from trouble with Great Britain, but he cannot both rid himself of his friends and win the war. For the assistance he has received he will, this at least is my personal view, have to pay a price not in the form of territory, but more probably in the shape of alliances covering military leases of ports as naval or air bases, the said ports to be fortified by the leasing Power, and, of course, economic concessions on a wide scale. The alliance solution, which would also presumably embrace Portugal, would eliminate any question of Spanish pride being ruffled by the cession of territory.G. H.
