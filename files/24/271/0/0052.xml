(THIS DOCUMBNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVEPIM3SNT). SECRET. CABINET. COPY NO.C.Po252 (57)o ELBCTRICITY DISTRIBUTION;Memorandum, &quot;by, the Minister of Transportr Intro ductlon:.;1.     The Cabinet discussed, on the fifth February, 1957, (Cabinet 9 (57))j the Second Report of the Cabinet Committee on Electricity Distribution (CoP.62f (57)) and authorised the Minister of Transport(a) to announce that His Majesty&apos;s Government had decided,  inprinciple, to accept the recommendations of the McGowan Committee subject to certain modifications, and to make those recommendations the basis of legislation:;(b) meanwhile, to discuss the legislative pro-posals with representative bodies interested in the matter;    and(c) to prepare a Bill for use in consultation with the partiesinterested, but not for present publication. 2.     An announcement of policy was accordingly made in the House of Commons on the 3rd March, 1937, in ^e following terms, which were agreed by the Lord Privy Seal, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland:-Sir Murdoch Macdonald asked the Minister of Transport whether he is in a position to announce the Governments decision upon the report of the Committee on Electricity Distribution?Mr. Hore-Belisha.,      Yes, Sir.      His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided to adopt in principle, subject to certain modifications in detail, the recommendations of the McGowan Committee for a reorganisation of electricity supply.     As the Prime Minister has already stated, it will not be possible to add to the programme of the present Session a Bill dealing with this matter, but His Majesty&apos;s Government intend at an early date to communicate to the associations of the principal interests affected an outline^of their legislative proposals, and we shall be prepared to discuss with the associations any points which they desire to raise.      The major modifications in the recommendations of the Committee are that the schemes for the consolidation of the separate undertakings will be prepared by the Electricity Commissioners, not by temporary district commissioners appointed for the purpose;    and that in every case, irrespective of the size of the undertakings concerned, schemes made by the Commissioners and not agreed by the undertakers will become operative only when confirmed by the Minister of Transport and approved by Parliament.
3c    An Outline of Proposals^  summarising the principal heads of a Bill., was circulated confidentially on the 5th of April to representative organisations of the Electricity Supply Industry,, local authorities;,, trade and agriculture,, and a copy is appended to this memorandum,,      The Organisations were invited to submit representations in writings  and deputations from a number of the more important of them have been received either by myself or by the Electricity Commissioners,,      I have also discussed the scheme with a representative gathering of the Trade and Industry. Committee of the House of Commons,,Reception of Outline of Proposals. 4,    I ought first to say that the reception of the Outline of Proposals was prejudiced by the circumstances of its issue.      It was the intention that the document should be dealt with confidentially by responsible organisations.      Some of these associations,, however, possess Councils consisting of numerous members, and some of them found it necessary to consult their constituent bodies3  with the result that the proposals were in fact widely known in a variety of quarters and to the Press,, although they were not available to Members&quot; of the House of Commons.      They could accordingly no longer be kept confidential, and had to be published by H.M. Stationery Office.      In the outcome5 this has perhaps be^n an advantage, but in the interval, misconceptions arose.Variations in Outline of Proposals from McGowan Report. 5.-    Criticism fastened in particular upon certain departures from the recommendations of the McGowan Committee and it may assist my colleagues if I draw attention to the principal variations;-(i)    The McGowan&apos;Committee suggested no specific grouping of undertakings; but left this to be worked out by specially appointed and paid District Commissioners,; whose schemes were, in turn to be subject to the review of the Electricity C ommi s s i oner s.
MSThe Cabinet Committee came to the conclusion, in which I fully concur that the appointment of separate District Commissioners would load to great expense and delay,  and that the schemes should be framed in the first instance by the Electricity Commissioners themselves,.      The Outline of Proposals,  therefore, proceeded upon this basis, and also included in an Appendix a tentative grouping of undertakings into districts and groups.      It was made clear that both the districts and the groups were merely provisional,  and would he subject to such adjustment as might be found necessary after a detailed investigation.(ii) About two-thirds of the Supply Undertakings are owned by municipal authorities, whether measured in number,  in capital or units sold.      There will,  of course, he no question of transferring the undertakings of the larger cities to companies, but it is inherent in the McGowan recommendations, and indeed in any sound scheme of reorganisation, that the smaller municipal undertakings should in general lose their identity by being-grouped with other local authorities or with companies.      The latter alternative is likely particularly to affect many of the small and isolated municipal undertakings in company areas. With a view ,to defining more closely the limits of this process, the Outline proposed,  in paragraph 10, that, where practicable without detriment to the efficiency of the scheme, preference should be given in the case of local authority undertakings to transfer to other local or public authorities and that if, in any district or area, the undertakings representing the majority or units sold so desired, the Electricity Commissioners might prepare a scheme for the establishment of a new Distribution Authority,  in which both the municipal and the company undertakings would be merged.      Stress was also laid,  in  -paragraph 7 of the Outline, upon the possibility of forming
Joint Boards where two or more neighbouring local authorities express a desire for that procedure, for which there are several precedents.( iii)    The recommendation   of the McGowan Committee that undertakings with an output of less than 10 million units should have no rights of appeal beyond the Electricity Commissioners was not adopted by the Cabinet, and the announcement of this decision gave satisfaction. (iv)    The McGowan Committee recommended that the Electricity Commissioners should be given power to approve the terms, but not the form,  of the new issue of capital by Companies.      The Outline proposed to require approval of form as well as terms.Attitude.of representative Associations to the McGowan Report.6.      Apart, however, from particular criticism of departures from the McGowan Report, there has been considerable criticism of the scope of the reorganisation proposed and the general lines on which it is to proceed.      In their second report (C.P.64(37))  the Cabinet Committee on Electricity Distribution dealt with the case for reorganisation of the distribution of electricity,   the opposition which might be anticipated and the probable reception of a Bill based on the McGowan proposals.      I feel that,  in the light of the representations which I have received in writing and by deputation, I should give a further appreciation of the position as I now see it.7.      The McGowan Committee stated (paragraphs 84 and 85 of their Report-)  that there can be &quot;no question that an improvement in the present organisation can and must be effected&apos;-,.......  In practicallyevery case the Associations and witnesses who have appeared before us have stated that the present organisation is unsatisfactory and calls for improvement.1&quot;     The Committee also recorded their view (paragraph 471(v)) that &quot;any attempt to carry through a scheme of reorganisation on a voluntary basis is bound to fail and legislation
must confer definite and adequate compulsory powers&apos;.      The Cabinet Committee accepted the general conclusions of the McGowan Committee and&apos; shared their view that the existing ^chaotic&quot; situation results in hardship and inconvenience to consumers and is prejudicial to the cheap and abundant supply of electricity.      They thought that public opinion would mainly judge the proposals by whatever prospects they held out of electricity supply being made available throughout the Country;,  including the rural areas,  at reasonable, more uniform., ands where possible? reduced prices.8,    The Companies&apos;reception of the McGowan report was generally favourable and  as I have indicated;, many criticisms of the Outline of Proposals, from this side of the Indus try, fasten upon alleged departures from that Report,      The Companies are unlikely therefore to dispute the need for some scheme of reorganisation and by the amendments which I propose later and by other adjustments which can be made in the course of settling the Bill, it should be possible to go a long way towards meeting thoir objections.      But they will naturally contest some mf the points which arise upon compensation, and will seek to weaken the control over prices and the issue of capital and the power to require development which the McGowan Committee and the Cabinet Committee regarded as a&apos; necessary accompaniment of the enhancement of their monopolistic pasition. Up^n such points there is room for compromise without saerifice of the principles cf the Reports   and the representative Associations have shown willingness to discuss matters of detail in a reasonable spirit.9,    The opposition ef the smaller Municipal authorities to the principle of the Report itself has proved even stronger than was -anticipated by the Cabinet Committee.      Agitation within the ranks of the Incorporated Municipal Electrical Association (fostered by certain influences outside) left that body in an embarrassing position when they met me in deputation,, since it was obvious that the views expressed on behalf of the small undertakings were not
shared hy much of the best expert opinion within the Association&apos;s own ranks,,      The fact remains that all the municipal organisations have declared themselves strongly in favour of the principle of maintaining and increasing public ownership in electricity.      In a memorandum recently received from the Incorporated Municipal Electrical Association it is stated that &quot;there is a very substantial weight of opinion with the Assoeiation which holds that reorganisation in some form is highly desirable but the bases of reorganisation as outlined by the White Paper have been very strongly criticised.&quot;10.    A conflict thus exists between company and local authority views.      The Company Associations contend that the Outline of Proposals is biased against private enterprise, and even seeks to provide for extension of municipal control. Local authority associations,,  on the other hand,  object to the acquisition in any circumstances of local authority undertakings by companies.      This process, they say,  is contrary to the principle of electricity legislation ever since 1882 which has favoured public ownership,  immediate or eventual.      They therefore argue that reorganisation,  in so far as it is unavoidable, should place Electricity Supply in-public hands and that this should be an early objective of public policy.-,      Here a political issue is raised in that the Labour Opposition has already declared itself in favour cf transferring all generating and distributing undertakings to a National Corporation with Regional Boards subject to a National Board.      It was this solution that the McGowan Committee considered and rejected as being revolutionarj&apos;-rather than evolutionary.
lie    Much of the Company Associations&apos;  contention arises,  I believe, from a wrong emphasis placed upon isolated passages in the Outline and the assumptions as to the way&apos;in which the provisional grouping of undertakings,  shown in Appendix &quot;A&quot; of that document would he likely to work out in practice.      So far as the power companies are concerned,  the majority of them, at any rate, will in themselves serve as the nucleus of groups under Basis &quot;A&quot; and the proposed limitation of their tenure,  at present perpetual, will he compensated by the extinction meanwhile of the rights of purchase which many local authorities could exercise (and in many cases at an early date;  piece-meal over parts of their distribution undertakings.       Many of the companies, other than power companies,  will also form a   nucleus of new groups and enjoy similar benefits of consolidated tenure, whereas they are now exposed,   in various degrees,  to disintegration.With regard to the local authority associations, the proposal whereby the consolidated company undertakings,  including those which now have a perpetual tenure, will become purchaseable in not more    than   50 years by a public    authority, should lessen the force of their objection. Manyof the larger local authority undertakings   will remain unaffected in respect of ownership,  or even have added
to their areas of supply some of their smaller neighbours - in some cases companies,,      Formation *?f Joint Boards will also no doubt in many cases he found to be justified,  and thus preserve public ownership over a considerable fi^ld in which it now exists,12,    It is important to bear in mind that under my proposals no individual authority will lose its identity except after a careful review of all the circumstances,,      The argument in favour of the small undertakings  that size is in itself no criterion of efficiency and that many small undertakings are in themselves well managed and have low charges:/  is therefore not excluded.      But the Bill will lay down wider tests of efficiency than this,  and it is inevitable - that any proposals for substantially reducing the number of existing undertakings should meet with opposition,  since most individual undertakings dislike the loss of their own identity, but while the larger undertaking is not necessarily more efficient,  it alone can offer thQ advantages of diversity of load, adequate financial resources, highly qualified personnel,  improved technical layout and possibilities of economy   in   capital expenditure.15.    Another point of principle tak*n by the Local Authority Associations  is that the purchase price for local authority undertakings should be computed on the sane basis as that for companies.      They have urged that as the ratepayers have risked a loss in establishing their undertaking, and have an express,  though strictly limited,  power of applying surpluses to the relief of rates, some allowance for goodwill should he made.      This contention was carefully considered and rejected by the IlcGowan Committee. Though many authorities carried sums to the relief of rates,  the policy of many others has been to reduce charges or improve facilities rather than to create surpluses.     Moreover,  a not unusual basis for the transfer of a local authority undertaking by agreement has been the payment of outstanding debt,  sometimes together with some consideration for past deficiencies met from
ftci.&apos; tl fir.rates.      The Committee recommended what in most cases will he a more generous basis;;    namelys  that the purchase price should cover the properly ascertained value of the physical assets;  less depreciation which will be calculated on a scale mere favourable to the local authorities than that allowed in connection with the loan sanctions upon which their existing sinking funds have been based. In view of the difference between the manner in which the two types of undertaking raise capital and are operateds  the local authorities&apos; representatives will find, it difficult to show any practicable means of giving effect to their claim for identical treatment3  and3 with certain concessions which can legitimately be made and to which I refer laters  it wills  I thinks be possible to show- that the terms offered to them are in themselves adequate and fair.14.    The Company Associations have objectedy  in particulars  to the proposed control of the for as  as distinct from the termss  of capital issues.      I have informed then that I do not propose to interfere with the structure of the existing capitals but9  in respect of new issues9 the opportunity of reforming abuses which are known to exist should be taken.      Cases have occurred in which shares have been issued when capital could have been more advantageously raised from the point *f view of the consumer by the exercise of borrowing powers.There is nothing inequitable in statutory control of companies to whom a local monopoly is given.      The gas industry is a clear precedent for this.      I have no doubt that this view will be supported by many members of both Houses5 who are of opinion that electricity is no longer a luxury but a major necessity.15.    The Company Associations have criticised strongly the details of the proposed sliding scale (Appendix &quot;C&quot; to the Outline) and I have asked the Electricity   Commissioners to discuss this further with them.      Existing scales have not proved to be effective safeguards to consumers.
Views of Consumers&apos; Associations.15c    The interests of the consumers will attract attention in the House of Commons where there is much dissatisfaction with the rate of development in many areas,  and with the level of charges and confusion of tariffSo      The proposals of the Outline were warmly welcomed by agricultural interests in so far as they were directed to securing greater efficiency and economy and the concentration of powers of supply in fewer hands,  and resolutions to this effect have been received from the Central Land Owners&apos; Association,  the national Farmers&apos;  Union and the Rational Farmers&apos; Union of Scotland.,      On the other hand, both the Federation of British Industries and the Urban District Councils&apos; Association are concerned lest the provision of cheap supplies to rural areas should be secured at the expense of urban consumers.      It would, of courses be a mistake to encourage the idea that an immediate reduction of price throughout the Country can be secured,  since the process of reorganisation must he gradual and it will often be mipre important to  secure a balanced development of service rather than some alteration in the level of charges.      There is, however,  room for substantial improvement in this respect and in securing greater uniformity of tariffs and greater technical standardisation, the absence of which often inflicts hardship on consumers.     &quot;Moreover the Bill will provide that prices in the area of an acquired undertaking shall not be increased except with the approval of the Electricity Commissioners - and this will he given only in very special circumstances.Representations of Staff Associations.17.    The necessary provisions for granting appropriate compensation to employees whose status or employment is affected by the proposed reorganisation will be included in the Bill.
**&apos; K JProposed Amendmentso^Ojxtllne of Proposals.18,    Following upon the representations which I have received as indicated in the preceding paragraphs there are certain amendments which I suggest might be made in the legislative proposals contained in the Outline     These are designed to maintain as fair a balance as possible between the conflicting interests and should go some way towards meeting opposition.19.    In the first place., I do not propose to schedule to the Bill either districts or groups.     The issue of the Appendix to the Outline has served its purpose in leading the undertakings themselves in many instances to consider and to discuss with one another the form which grouping should eventually take, but it would be, from many points of view, undesirable to attempt in the Bill to indicate in advance the grouping which can only be properly settled after a detailed investigation.20.    I propose further to make it clear that, before any scheme is made, the Electricity undertakings concerned, and also the local authorities in the area, should have a right to be heard.21*   Next, I would ask the Cabinet to agree to substitute some form of procedure by Provisional Order for that by Special Order proposed in the Outline.      It will be remembered that the Cabinet Committee (see minutes of the 4th Meeting, E.D*36) preferred procedure by Special Order mainly on the ground that it would reduce the expenditure of Parliamentary time in dealing with individual schemes, but the Committee recognised that the question might have to be considered in the event of serious opposition developing.     The important point of difference is that under Provisional Order procedure the undertakings concerned would have an automatic right to be heard by Counsel before a Committee of each House, whereas, under present Special Order procedure, no such right exists. The Government might defeat a resolution to refer an Order to a Select Committee for examination.
InThe proposal to adopt Special Order procedure has evoked the most violent opposition from all interests concerned,  and some important representatives have said that a concession on this point would do more than anything else to remove opposition to the scheme.I have been convinced by the arguments    put before me that it will be impossible to retain the provision that schemes should be confirmed merely by Special Order procedure,  and I suggest that it will be expedient to recognise this now.      (indeed, if my colleagues approve this change, which I regard as inevitable, I should like to announce it before the introduction of the Bill,  since to do so will probably materially assist negotiation on other points.)     At the same time, I propose to discuss with the proper authorities whether any steps could be taken to reduce the amount of time involved in Provisional Order procedure,  and to avoid the intermediate stage of Inquiry by a Minister after the settlement of the scheme by the Electricity Commissioners.      The scheme would then be formulated by the Commissioners,  after a public hearing of interested parties, and, as settled by them, presented to Parliament and referred automatically to a Select Committee, or possibly a Joint Committee of both houses.      The same Committee might deal with a series of Orders presented in any one Session.By substituting Provisional for Special Order procedure, T think we shall also dispose of the main objection to the making of schemes being entrusted to the Electricity Commissioners directly and not after some preliminary investigation by ad hoc District Commissioners.      In discussion, representatives of the Electricity Industry have admitted the many difficulties inherent in the alternative proposal, and I think that, with the safeguard of a final and effective appeal to Parliament, they will be satisfied on this point.22.      I come now to a more difficult question, namely, how far we should seek to insert directions in the Bill indicating the circumstances in which preference should be given to the
reorganisation of municipal undertakings round a municipal nucleus. It seems to me that, where this can he done without detriment to efficiency and without involving the continued isolation of rural areas,  it is entirely reasonable that adjacent local authorities should he permitted and encouraged to combine with one another into Joint Boards,  and I do not therefore recommend any weakening of Basis &quot;C&quot; in paragraph 7 of the outline.     At the same time, I think that local authorities which wish to combine on this basis should be prepared to do so on the general basis of being reimbursed their liabilities in respect of their outstanding debt. This principle may require some adjustment to meet special cases, but,  subject to further examination,  I would propose to include it in the Bill.23.    On the other hand, none of the representative Associations appear to favour the creation of new Distribution Authorities under Basis &quot;B&quot; in paragraph 7 of the Outline, and the Company interests in particular take exception to the proposal contained in paragraph 10(i)  enabling Undertakers,  representing the majority of the units sold in any district or scheme area,  to make representations in favour of this alternative, provided they are prepared to transfer their own undertakings, to the new authrrity.      There may well be circumstances in which the establishment of a Distribution Authority will offer the best and perhaps,  as the iucGowan Committee recognised,  the only practicable solution, but I would propose to give it less emphasis and to make it clear that it should only be adopted in exceptional circumstances.      I would also drop the proposed direction contained in paragraph 10 (i) which has been construed as enabling the undertakings selling the majority of units represented in any area to demand the establishment af a Dis-cribution authority.
ok1?24o    As regards terms of ti^ansferj  it may be necessary to draw attention to certain points when the draft of the Bill is submittedj but meanwhile I do not propose any alterations in principle apart from the following exceptions.fhe Outline proposes in Appendix Bs Part III;that the purchase money received by a local authorityfor the sale of its undertaking (which will be based upon the capital value of its assets less depreciation without allowance for goodwill) together with retained investments and cash balances should be applied first in discharge of outstanding loans and other liabilitieSj next in reimbursement of any net amount contributed from local rates since 1926,  and as regards any balance then remaining,for the benefit of electricity consumers or for further electrical development in the area of the transferred undertaking.fhe Associations of local authorities have most strongly contended that their disposal of any such balance of money should be left to their own discretions  subject only to the approval of the Minister of Health.      If this be conceded,, it will no doubt mean that in most cases the balances;   which will have been accumulated in the past out of the charges made to consumers of electricity and in certain cases may be substantial, will be devoted to the reduction of rates.;  the repayment of general capital expenditure or some other local purpose.I do not think we can refuse some latitude and I propose that local authorities should be permitted to apply such balances to the benefit of electricity consumers and to electrical development or to such other purposes as the Minister of Health may approve.
I seek authority to make this concession and to use it in negotiation in such manner as may seem most appropriate.In itself this concession does not meet the contention, referred to in paragraph 13 of this memorandum,  that the purchase price for local authority undertakings should he computed on the same basis as that for companies and that some allowance for goodwill should be made.      I am not yet in a position to say how strongly this contention will be pressed or what would be the best way in which it could be met.      If, after further negotiation,  it should appear advisable to do so, I should like to have authority to make such further concesnion as I consider necessary and appropriate.25.      Strong exception has been taken to the proposal of the McGowan Committee that the Electricity Commissioners should have power to require electricity supply undertakings to offer apparatus on hire-purchase. I agree that a compulsory power of this kind is open to objection, and I propose to omit it.CONCLUSIONS26.      This amendments set out in the preceding paragraphs 19 to 25,  especially the postponing of - grouping and the acceptance of the view that there should be an effective appeal to Parliament itself before any controversial scheme is enforced upon any authorised undertaking,  should do much to meet reasonable opinion in the industry of electricity supply itself. I do.not think, however, that even with these amendments,  the Bill will go through without considerable opposition from the organised undertakings.      This is indeed inevitable, seeing that the Bill will provide for a comprehensive review of the industry, resulting in the merging or grouping of a considerable number of the smaller undertakings with the consequent
disturbance to vested interests in all parts of the country,  and more stringent control of the reorganised industry.      Opposition will come from both sides - advocates of non-interference with the companies and the advocates of municipal control.      It will thus to some extent cancel out and we can appeal in the interests of consumers to opinion which is not committed to any class of electricity undertaking.It must, however, be recognised that the opposition of the smaller municipal bodies is likely to be strongly pressed during the progress of the Bill, with the fall support of the Labour opposition.      Nor will it be possible to modify the scheme so as to guarantee that the undertakings of municipal bodies are in no circumstances to be merged with a company undertaking under a company form of management and ownership. The best answers to the criticisms on this score will be that each case will be most carefully reviewed after full opportunity has been given for the hearing of objections, first by the Electricity Commissioners and then by Parliament itself,  that the scheme of reorganisation is a balanced one which will bring the existing company undertakers under that effective control in the interests of consumers in the matter of prices and development which is admittedly now lacking,  that it safeguards the possibility of eventual public ownership,  and provides for the extinction of the existing perpetual tenures of the Power Companies.It is ereatljr to the interests of   the Industry itself that the present state of uncertainty as to its future organisation should be removed at the earliest possible date,  in order that there may be no check to development at a rate commensurate with the needs of the public.
I therefore recommend that a Bill to deal with the reorganisation of the distribution of electricity supply should he promised in the King&apos;s Speech,  and that I may he authorised to incorporate in the 3ill9 which is in process of being drafted, the amendments which I have suggested in paragraphs 19 to 25 above,  viz;-(a) Omission of districts and groupings from the Bill(para,19)0(b) Right of hearing to be given not only to electricity undertakings concerned, but also to local authorities in the area before any scheme is made (para.20).(c) Substitution of Special Order procedure by some formof Provisional Order procedure (para.21).(d) Encouragement of local authorities to combine intoJoint Boards in suitable areas where this can be done without prejudice to the efficiency of a scheme (para.22).(e) Distribution Boards to be established only in exceptional circumstances;, and proposal in paragraph 10(1)  of the Outline of Proposals to he dropped (para.23).(f) Balance of money in the hands of vendor localauthorities to be applied to the benefit of electricity consumers and to electricity development or to such other purposes as the Minister of Health may approve.(g) Omission of proposal that Electricity commisioners should have power to require electricity supply undertakings to offer apparatus on hire-purchase (para.25).L.B. 22.10.37.

Outline of proposals as circulated to representative Associations, who have been informed that the Minister will consider representations on the main features of the proposals made to him by 30 June, 1937.The outline is confined to the main features of the scheme and will require amplification for the purposes of a Bill. The proposals are also open to such modifications in detail as may seem necessary or advisable, after the views and suggestions of the various Associations have been considered. It will be seen that, in regard to the terms of compensation (Appendix B) and otherwise, the outline of proposals is based generally on the recommendations of the Committee (whose report was published in June, 1936), although those recommendations have been modified in some respects, of which the most important are those specifically mentioned in the Minister&apos;s statement.In Appendix C will be found the basis of a Sliding Scale suggested by the Electricity Commissioners.
ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTIONOutline of the main provisions proposed for securing the reorganis-ation of distribution on the general lines recommended in the Report of the Committee on Electricity Distribution.The following outline of the proposals which it is the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to embody in a Bill for presentation in Parliament is circulated at this stage in order that it may serve as a basis for discussion with representative bodies.Distribution Districts1. The Distribution Districts which appear to be suitable for the consolidation of the undertakings situated therein into a group or groups for improving the organisation of supply will be scheduled to the Bill.The Distribution Districts at present suggested by the Electricity Com-missioners on the information before them are set out in column 2 of Appendix &quot;A&quot; to this Memorandum. Power will be reserved to the Electricity Commissioners to make adjustments of these districts after a detailed investigation and consideration of any representations made to them.2. Provision will also be made whereby the various electricity districts provisionally or finally determined under the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1919, for the purposes of that Act will be superseded as and when the new Schemes come into operation.Preparation of Schemes3. The Electricity Commissioners will be charged with the duty of reviewing all the undertakings in each Distribution District and of preparing a Scheme or Schemes, after consultation with the undertakers concerned, for the consolidation of the undertakings therein into a group or groups. To meet the case of established undertakings which it may be found desirable to leave undisturbed, there will be power to the Commissioners to make a single undertaking the subject of a Scheme.Note. This procedure involves some departure from the recommendations of the Committee on Electricity Distribution, who proposed the appointment of temporary District Commissioners for the preparation of Schemes. It appears to His Majesty&apos;s Government that such temporary appointments would not result in a saving of time as the findings of the District Commissioners would in each case have to be reviewed by the Electricity Commissioners ; and that having regard to the modified proposals (to which reference is made in paragraph 14) as regards the confirmation of Schemes, it would be a simpler and more expeditious procedure for the preparation of the Schemes to be undertaken by the Electricity Commissioners.4. Provisional groupings of undertakings in the suggested Distribution Districts are set out in the last column of Appendix &quot;A&quot; to this Memorandum as a basis for consideration. These groupings would be subject to such adjustment as may be found necessary after a detailed examination of the individual undertakings concerned, after ascertaining the probable trend of electrical development in each District and after due consideration of any representations which may be put forward.
5. The undertakings indicated by a group number without any further sub-division are those which, by reason of their location or other circumstances, such as the desirability of combining urban and rural areas, might, prima facie, be consolidated to form a convenient administrative unit. In the groups which are sub-divided, as indicated by a letter, into individual undertakings or sub-groups, the individual undertakings or sub-groups might each form a convenient adminis-trative unit, but the detailed examination of the whole of the undertakings under the same group number might show the desirability of a different sub-division or re-grouping.6. The groupings shown are provisional suggestions of the Electricity Com-missioners pending their more detailed examination of the position. They are included in the present outline of proposals in order to furnish some indication of the possible scope of reorganisation, and also in order to assist the formulation of proposals for agreed amalgamations which could be incorporated in Schemes. At the Ministers request, the Electricity Commissioners will be prepared to discuss with the undertakers concerned any proposals of this kind which they may wish to put forward in advance of the introduction of a Bill.Basis of Schemes7. The Electricity Commissioners will be empowered to prepare Schemes for the compulsory amalgamation of undertakings by acquisition or transfer on one of the following bases : (i) Basis AThe acquisition (on terms to be set out in the Bill and referred to in paragraphs 15 and 16 of this Memorandum) by one undertaker of the other existing undertakings and parts of undertakings in the area covered by a Scheme.(ii) Basis BThe transfer of all existing undertakings and parts of undertakings in the area covered by a Scheme to a newly constituted Distribution Authority.The Committee recognised that cases might arise where a satisfactory scheme of amalgamation on Basis A would not be possible, and suggested that the undertakings should then be otherwise merged or transferred to some form of Public Authority.To meet such cases it is proposed that a Scheme may include provision for the setting up of a Distribution Authority to take a transfer of all the undertakings in the area of the Scheme. It is proposed that each such Distribution Authority shall consist of not less than seven nor more than twelve members appointed by the Minister of Transport after consultation with the local authorities (including the County Councils) and organisations representative of industry and agriculture in the area ; and that the Minister of Transport should fix the terms of office and the remuneration of the Chairman and the members of the Authority. Provision will also be made for the Authority to be a body corporate, with power to borrow money and issue stock, etc., and to be the undertakers for the Scheme area with power to supply electricity therein for all purposes ; and for all the undertakings in the Scheme area to vest in the Authority as from an appointed day to be specified in the Scheme and on the terms of purchase set out in the Bill.(iii) Basis CThe transfer of the undertakings of two or more local authorities to a newly constituted Joint Board.Consolidation on this basis will meet the case where local authorities express a desire to be formed into a Joint Board and the Electricity Commissioners are satisfied that an adequate improvement can be effected in that manner. The Joint Board would be established by means of a Special Order under Section 8 of the Electric Lighting Act, 1909, and provision will be made whereby small areas intervening between or adjoining those of the local authority undertakings concerned may be brought within the scope of a Scheme on this basis.
8. Consequential provisions will be included in the Bill to provide that the consolidated undertaking for the area of a Scheme shall be operated as one under-taking, but for the time being under the then-existing powers relating to the various undertakings which have been consolidated, subject, however, to any amendment of such powers effected by general provisions in the Bill; and, so far as may be necessary, for the supersession of any District Authority, Board or Committee set up under the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1919, or for the adjustment or amendment of its constitution or powers, and for the winding-up of any Company whose under-taking may have been acquired.9. The acquiring undertaker for the area of each Scheme will be required to apply where necessary within a specified period to the Electricity Commissioners for a Special Order to consolidate the supply powers in the area of the Scheme and to revoke all duplicate and redundant powers in the area. In the absence of the submission of a Draft Order within the specified period, the Electricity Commissioners will be empowered themselves to make an Order.Note. This method of dealing with the complicated position concerning supply powers will simplify and expedite the preparation of the Schemes themselves and will obviate the delay which would necessarily occur if detailed consideration had to be given at that stage to all the local Acts and Orders of the undertakings concerned and the various protective and other provisions contained therein.Principles to be observed in preparation of Schemes10. The Electricity Commissioners will be directed to have regard, among other relevant considerations, to the following general principles in the preparation of the Schemes : (a) The primary considerations to be taken into account are that a substantial reduction in the present number of undertakings (with the complete elimination of all duplicate powers) is to be effected by the substitution where appropriate of larger and more economic units ; that the area of ^supply of each such unit should be sufficiently large to embrace a reasonable diversity of demand and to ensure that future technical develop-ment can proceed on comprehensive and economic lines, and should where possible include an appropriate grouping of rural and urban areas; and that the unit should have adequate financial resources for such development.(b) The Schemes are to be based so far as possible on the retention of the larger and more efficient of the existing undertakings, i.e., in accordance with Basis A set out in paragraph 7.Where satisfactory reorganisation on such principles is not found practicable on the lines of Basis A, the Electricity Commissioners will be empowered to prepare Schemes for a Distribution Authority on the lines of Basis B, or for a Joint Board in appropriate cases on the lines of Basis C.(c) Where the undertaker to whom other undertakings are to be transferred by a Scheme objects to take such transfer, the Electricity Commissioners will be empowered to prepare a substituted Scheme for the setting up of a Distribution Authority covering all the undertakings in the Scheme area.In order to facilitate the formulation of voluntary or agreed schemes, it is further proposed to include directions to the Electricity Commissioners that (i) If in any Distribution District or Scheme area the undertakers representing the majority of the units sold (other than sales in bulk to authorised undertakers) in the District or area in the last completed year preceding the enactment of the legislation or the publication of the Scheme, as the case may be, make representations that a Distribution Authority should be set up and that they are prepared to transfer their undertakings to such an Authority, the Commissioners may prepare a Scheme or substituted Scheme for the District or area on that basis covering all the undertakings in the District or area;  and(ii) Where the undertakings in any Scheme area include local authority undertakings and the Scheme provides for consolidation by their acquisition, upon Basis A, they shall give preference, where practicable without prejudice to the efficiency of the Scheme, to the transfer of such local authority undertakings to other neighbouring local or public authority undertakings.
Requirements to be satisfied in respect of Schemes11. The Electricity Commissioners will be required to satisfy themselves in respect of each Scheme (i) that it will result in more efficient technical operation, or in economies as regards capital expenditure on future developments, or convenience of administration in the consolidated areas, and that the resulting economies will be passed on to consumers in the form of reduced prices ;(ii) that the&apos; amalgamations involved are likely, according to the best information available to the Electricity Commissioners, to lead to lower charges to consumers as the schemes achieve their full results; and(iii) that consumers will not be prejudicially affected as regards regularity and efficiency of supply.12. It is also proposed to provide that the average prices charged to consumers of particular classes in the area of any acquired undertaking shall not be increased except with the approval of the Electricity Commissioners, who shall take into account any special circumstances beyond the control of the consolidated under-taking for the Scheme area which would have affected the original undertakings had there been no Scheme.Publication and making of Schemes13. Provision will be made for the publication of the Scheme or Schemes prepared by the Electricity Commissioners for each District as the result of their review of all the undertakings and after consultation with the undertakers ; and for undertakers and local authorities (including County Councils) and other bodies which appear to the Commissioners to be interested in a Scheme to be afforded an opportunity of making representations with regard to that Scheme. The Electricity Commissioners will be empowered to afford hearings to such parties as they think fit, and to make the Scheme or Schemes with such alterations as are required or may appear to them desirable. ,Confirmation of Schemes14. Schemes which are agreed by the undertakers concerned will become operative and have full effect when made by the Electricity Commissioners ; but in all other cases the Schemes made by the Commissioners will become operative only when confirmed with or without modification by the Minister of Transport after consideration of any representations made to him and after such inquiry, if any, as he may think fit, and when subsequently approved by each House of Parliament.Note.-The Committee recommended that, in addition to agreed Schemes, Schemes involving the compulsory transfer of undertakings with an output not exceeding 10 million units in 1935-36 should also become operative forthwith after being made by the Electricity Commissioners. It is proposed by His Majesty&apos;s Government that all Schemes (other than those agreed by the undertakers concerned) shall be subject to confirmation by the Minister of Transport and approval by Parliament.Terms of Purchase15. With regard to the terms upon which existing undertaldngs should be acquired or transferred, it will be provided that unless the purchase price is agreed between the Purchaser and Vendor and approved as hereinafter mentioned, the price to be paid shall be ascertained in accordance with the provisions of the Act. The terms of purchase proposed to be included in the Bill are set out in Appendix &quot; B &quot; to this Memorandum. ;16. The Bill will provide for the setting up of an Arbitration Tribunal by the Lord Chancellor to determine the purchase price where not otherwise agreed ; and the Tribunal will be charged with the duty of settling such matters as are specifically referred to them by the Bill and any other question which may arise between the parties as to the amount and form of the purchase consideration. It will also fall to the Tribunal to approve of the purchase price in cases where the price has been agreed between the Purchaser and Vendor.
Tenure of Retained Companies : Existing Purchase Rights17. It is proposed that in respect of all company undertakings retained under a Scheme, the Company&apos;s tenure of the consolidated undertaking shall be such period not exceeding 50 years as may be prescribed by the Scheme ; that in deter-mining the period regard shall be had by the Electricity Commissioners to the dates when any of the existing distribution undertakings owned by the Company would have become purchaseable by the local authorities ; and that the consolidated undertaking under the Scheme shall be purchaseable as a whole at the end of the prescribed tenure, or at any interval of 10 years thereafter, by an existing or new public body to be duly authorised or constituted for the purpose, on the basis of capital properly expended less depreciation on a scale to be prescribed.18. With a view to the simplification of the position with regard to purchase rights, it is proposed that in respect of the consolidated area of any retained under-taking, whether of a Company or a Public Authority, under a Scheme made by the Electricity Commissioners, all existing rights of purchase whether arising under the General Acts or under local or special Acts or Orders, Deeds of Transfer or any other instruments, shall be rescinded.Control over Capital Issues, Charges and Extension of Facilities19. It is proposed that Power Companies and Distribution Companies retained under area Schemes shall be subject during their consolidated tenure to control in the form of a sliding scale relating prices to profits ; and in respect of the issue of new capital.20. The sliding scale will provide for a standard rate of dividend on Ordinary Share Capital and prescribe the basis on which any surplus profits are to be allocated as between consumers and ordinary shareholders. The proposed form of sliding scale is set out in Appendix &quot; C &quot; to this Memorandum.21. The approval of the Electricity Commissioners will be required to the terms and form of any issue of new capital and also to the terms of any temporary borrowing between Companies.22. For the better control of methods of charge and the extension of facilities to consumers, provision will be made whereby as from the date on which the Act comes into force authorised undertakers in general (whether affected by Schemes or not) can be required (i) to offer approved two-part or other appropriate tariffs for domestic and other supplies ; this power to be coupled with a further power whereby on any revision of authorised . maximum prices, separate maxima may be fixed, or separate methods of charge imposed, in respect of different classes of supply;(ii) to provide distribution mains of- adequate capacity within a prescribed period in uncabled streets in built-up areas ;(iii) to submit and carry out approved schemes of extensions for ; undeveloped areas ;(iv) to offer facilities for assisted wiring and for the hire or hire-purchase of electrical apparatus ; this power to be coupled with a further power to approve or fix from time to time the rates or terms offered by the undertakers; and(v) to modify, after consideration among other relevant circumstances of the probable growth of demand in the locality, the right of undertakers to require a guaranteed gross revenue of 20 per cent, in relation to capital expenditure before giving new supplies.23. Provision will also be made whereby adjoining undertakers will be enabled or can be required by the Electricity Commissioners to enter into arrangements for mutual assistance for the various purposes indicated in Section 19 of the Electricity. (Supply) Act, 1919, so as to make the Section a permanent provision instead of a transitory one as at present. In addition, powers will be proposed whereby the undertakers in Distribution Districts can be required to put forward for approval Schemes for bringing about uniformity in the conditions of supply in their areas.
Holding Companies24. With regard to the relationship between Holding Companies and Subsidiary Companies, in so far as these are authorised undertakers, such consolidation as is desirable and practicable will be effected by means of the Schemes already mentioned.25. Further provision will be proposed whereby no arrangements between an authorised undertaker and a Holding Company or Associated Contracting Company for the execution of works, the provision of material or the rendering of services shall continue in force after the date of a scheme or may be entered into after that date unless they are approved by the Electricity Commissioners.26. The Bill will also provide that the accounts of a Holding Company which controls subsidiary Companies owning or operating authorised electricity under-takings and any associated contracting or management Companies shall, so far as they are concerned with transactions between the said Companies, be open to inspection by Auditors appointed by the Electricity Commissioners.Compensation  or Officers and Servants27. It is proposed to provide for the transfer to the acquiring undertakings of existing staff solely or mainly occupied in the acquired undertakings; and while His Majesty&apos;s Government anticipate that the effect of the Schemes will be to stimulate consumption and thereby improve prospects and employment in the Supply Industry, provision will be made for the payment of compensation by the acquiring undertakers to any officers or servants so transferred who may be dis-placed or whose position may be worsened as a consequence of the Scheme and who make a claim within five years of their transfer. It is also proposed to make provision whereby the superannuation rights of transferred officers and servants will be preserved and whereby authorised undertakers in general will be empowered to establish Superannuation Schemes.Protection for Central Electricity Board28. The Committee pointed out that care would have to be exercised when approving Schemes for the improvement of distribution to ensure that the revenues of the Central Electricity Board during their existing budgetary periods would not be adversely affected.By the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1926, the Central Board were required to fix their Grid Tariffs so as to secure that over an approved period of years the receipts of the Board on income account should be sufficient to cover their expenditure on income account, including interest and sinking fund charges, with an appropriate margin allowed by the Electricity Commissioners. The Grid Tariffs were prepared on the basis of the continued development of existing unamalgamated undertakings and made due allowance for the estimated revenue from the various supplies given by the Central Board, such as supplies at Grid Tariff and supplies to the owners of selected stations on the terms provided for in the Act.By reason of the enlargement and consolidation of undertakings under the new Schemes, and of the consequent amalgamation of loads, the relation between the above-mentioned classes of supply will be disturbed, and the finances of the Central Board therefore stand to be adversely affected. With a view to safe-guarding the position of the Central Board for such period as may be necessary, provision will be made to ensure that the revenue to be received, by the Board from the amalgamated undertakings shall be substantially the same as that which the Board would have received had the undertakings remained unamalgamated.Greater London29. As proposed by the Committee, the basis on which schemes of reorganisation are to be prepared will apply to Greater London as well as to the remainder of the country. The settlement effected by the London Electricity (No. 1 and No. 2) Acts, 1925, will remain in operation, subject only to such variations as may be necessary to accord with any scheme for the amalgamation or consolidation of the undertakings of the London Companies.
5th April, 1937.Other Legislative Provisions30. It is proposed to include in the Bill provision in respect of the following matters : (i) All undertakers to be required to publish the actual scale of fixed charges under their two-part tariffs.(ii) Supply Authorities to be empowered subject to the consent of the owners (and in the case of buildings, the occupiers) to attach their cables to buildings and bridges, with suitable provision for appeal if such consent is unreasonably withheld.(iii) Section 23 of the Electric Lighting Act, 1909, (prohibiting un-authorised undertakers from competing with statutory undertakers) to be amended to provide that an unauthorised undertaker shall not be allowed to supply electricity to new consumers within the area of an authorised undertaker without the consent of such undertaker, subject to a right of appeal to the Electricity Commissioners.(iv) Authorised undertakers to be entitled, with the consent of the Electricity Commissioners, to acquire compulsorily the mains and other apparatus used by unauthorised undertakers for supplying consumers, on the basis of capital expenditure less depreciation ; consent only to be given where the Electricity Commissioners are satisfied that no undue hardship would fall on the consumer.(v) Local Authorities not to be entitled to restrict the right of any owner or occupier of premises to take a supply of electricity.(vi) Amendment of the Schedule to the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1919, so as to make the holding of an Inquiry by the Minister of Transport in connection with the confirmation of Special Orders permissive instead of mandatory.
APPENDIX &quot;A&quot;Distribution Districts and possible Groupings of Undertakings therein suggested as a basis forconsideration1. The Distribution Districts at present suggested by the Electricity Commissioners on the information before them, and provisional groupings of undertakings in the suggested Districts, are set out in the following pages as a basis for consideration.2. Both the suggested Districts and the provisional groupings would be subject to such adjustment as may be found necessary after a detailed investigation and consideration of any representations made.3. The undertakings indicated by a group number without any further sub-division are those which by reason of their location or other circumstances, such as the desirability of combining urban and rural areas, might, prima facie, be consolidated to form a convenient administrative unit. In the groups which are sub-divided as indicated by a letter into individual undertakings or sub-groups, the individual undertakings or sub-groups might each form a convenient administrative unit, but the detailed examination of the whole of the undertakings under the same group number might show the desirability of a different sub-division or re-grouping.Description of District.Group No.Undertakings in Group.The County of Cumberland.The County of Westmorland.The parts of the County of Lancaster included in the Undertakings of Barrow-in-Furness Corpn., Ulverston U.D.C., Grange U.D.C., Cark Co. and West-morland Co.The part of the County of Yorkshire included in the Undertaking of the Sedbergh Co.Carlisle Corpn.

APPENDIX &quot; B &quot;Terms of Purchase of Undertakings transferred or acquired compulsorily under SchemesPART I Purchase PriceThe purchase price to be the sum of the following items: (i) The amount properly expended by the Vendor for capital purposes (whether defrayed out of capital or revenue) and attributable to the physical assets suitable to and used for the purposes of the undertaking at the date of transfer, together with any duly authorised capital-isation of interest, less depreciation in accordance with a scale to be scheduled to the Bill (see Part IV of this Appendix), and together with hire purchase balances due from consumers.(ii) Valuation of stocks and stores taken over other than physical assets included in item (i) above. -(iii) Where the Vendor is a local authority (including a Joint Electricity Authority or a Joint Board) the outstanding liability (if any) in respect of expenses properly being liquidated over a period of years other than expenses included in item (i) above.(iv) Where the Vendor is a Company, compensation for loss of future profits during the unexpired period of the franchise of the Vendor Company. By &quot; unexpired period &quot; is meant the period up to the next date on which the undertaking becomes subject to a right of purchase on terms specified in or corresponding to those of Section 2 of the Electric Lighting Act, 1888, or Section 39 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1926.The Purchaser to take over consumers deposits and any investments and cash balances of any Superannuation and other Staff Funds relating to employees transferred with the undertaking. The Vendor to be entitled to retain all other investments and cash balances ; to have the right to collect all debts and accounts due to the undertaking up to the date of transfer; and to be responsible for liquidating all debts and liabilities attaching to the undertaking at that date.There may be certain cases where the purchase price for Local Authorities&apos; undertakings on the foregoing basis may be less favourable than the sum necessary to discharge outstanding loans and other debts and liabilities in respect of the Undertaking. In these cases the terms of acquisition will provide the necessary sum to cover these items.If the terms in any Act or Order on which the undertaking of a Vendor Company may be purchased at the next occurring purchase date provide expressly or in effect for some allowance for goodwill, the Purchaser to have the option of purchasing on those terms, with compensation for loss of future profits during the period up to that purchase date.Where the Vendor is a Company, the following supplementary provisions to apply :  Amount properly expendedIn determining the amount properly expended under item (i), the Arbitration Tribunal to make an appropriate deduction where it is shown that the cost of works contains an unreasonable allowance for services rendered by Holding Companies or their subsidiaries.Future ProfitsWith regard to item (iv), the compensation for loss of future profits during the unexpired period of the franchise of the Vendor Company to be determined by the Arbitration Tribunal on the basis of the excess of the estimated net maintainable income during the said period over the income which would be derived from the investment of the amount paid by the Purchaser under items (i) and (ii) above in stocks or shares of a similar kind to those of the Vendor Company.Net Maintainable IncomeThe net maintainable income to be the annual profits estimated to be earned by the physical assets taken over, based upon the profits earned by such assets prior to the date of purchase, less depreciation in accordance with a scale to be scheduled to the Bill (see Part IV of. this Appendix), the Arbitration Tribunal to be directed when assessing the estimated net maintainable income: (a) To exclude net income from assets not taken over (e.g., rents of surplus properties) and interest on the investments of depreciation, renewal, reserve and other surplus revenue funds.(b) To have regard to the suitability of the amount of the charges for maintenance in relation to the physical condition of the assets.(c) To have regard to the circumstances that if the acquired undertaking had remained in existence it would have been subject to existing statutory provisions relating to the revision of maximum prices and the imposition and revision of sliding scales of prices and dividends and to such further control as may be imposed by Parliament in the Bill; and that such control would be exercised so as to prevent the undertaking from paying more than a reasonable return on the capital properly expended.(d) To make an appropriate allowance in any case where the present level of return on capital is less than a reasonable one and where in the circumstances of the undertaking a future higher level of return might reasonably (subject to the. provisions of paragraph (c) above) be anticipated, as for instance in the case of new undertakings.
.  PART IIPayment of purchase price(i) Where the Vendor is a Local Authority (including a Joint Electricity Authority or a Joint Board) the Vendor shall have the option : (a) of receiving the purchase consideration in cash ; or(b) of requiring the Purchaser to pay to the Vendor from time to time sums equivalent to the interest and sinking fund charges on the loans outstanding in respect of the acquired undertaking, the Vendor to receive any balance of the consideration in cash.(ii) Where the Vendor is a Company, the Vendor to have the option of receiving the purchase - consideration either (a) in cash ; or(b) in stocks or shares of the Purchaser at a price to be determined by the Arbitration Tribunal.PART IIIApplication by Local Authority Vendors oi the purchase money and retained balances, etc.The purchase money received by the Local Authority together with retained investments and cash balances to be applied as follows : (a) In discharge of outstanding loans and other net debts and liabilities in respect of the undertaking,(b) In reimbursement of any net amount contributed to the electricity undertaking from the local rates in respect of revenue deficiencies since the passing of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1926,(c) Any balance remaining after application as at [a) and (b) to be used for the benefit of electricity consumers or for further electrical development in the area of the transferred undertaking.PART IV Scale of DepreciationIt would appear to be appropriate to schedule, for the purposes of the Bill as defined in this outline, whatever scale of depreciation is adopted for the purposes of Section 39 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1926. The Scale of Depreciation (Purchase of Electricity Undertakings) Special Order, 1937, was made by the Electricity Commissioners in March, 1937, and is now awaiting confirmation and approval.Supplementary provision may be required as regards the application of the scale in cases such as those involving assets which were second-hand when brought into use and those where the life of an asset may have been impaired by inadequate maintenance or other causes.
APPENDIX &apos;* C &quot; Proposed Sliding ScaleWith regard to Companies which are retained under area Schemes, the legislation will provide that as from an appointed day fixed by a Scheme the Company shall be subject to a sliding scale relating prices to profits.   The main outlines of the proposed sliding scale are as follows : (a) If in any year of account the total revenue of the Company from all sources exceeds the sum of the following costs and charges, namely : (1) Working and establishment expenses and expenditure on the maintenance of the undertaking properly chargeable to revenue.(2) Depreciation not exceeding a Scale to be scheduled to the Bill (see Part IV of Appendix &quot; B &quot;).(3) Contribution to Contingency or Special Purposes Fund not exceeding one quarter of one per cent, on capital expenditure attributable to the undertaking. (4) Interest on Consumers&apos; Deposits. (5) Interest on Debentures and Loans. (6) Dividend on Preference Shares.(7) Dividend at the standard rate on the Ordinary Capital, the surplus to be allocated as regards five-sixths to an Income Suspense Account, and as regards one-sixth to a Dividend Suspense Account.(b) The Income Suspense Account to be applied by the Company in reduction of charges and tariffs and/or rebate to consumers, in such manner as may be approved by the Electricity Commissioners.(c) The Dividend Suspense Account to be available for additional dividend to Ordinary Shareholders.(d) The standard rate of dividend (referred to in paragraph (a) hereof) to be determined by the Electricity Commissioners after consideration, inter alia, of the undermentioned circumstances: il) The capital structure of the company undertakings included in the Scheme and the average level of profits earned by such undertakings during the 3 years prior to the appointed day.(2) The changes in capital due to acquisitions under the Bill. (3) The existence of free reserves.(4) The operation of existing powers and the additional powers imposed by Parliament in the Bill for the control of retained Companies in respect of issue of capital and revision of maximum prices.(e) The standard rate of dividend determined in manner aforesaid to be specified in the Scheme (or in a Special Order).(/) The provisions of the sliding scale relating to the proportion of any surplus to be allocated to consumers and ordinary shareholders respectively, and to the amount which may be contributed to Contingency or Special Purposes Fund, will be subject to review and revision if necessary at triennial intervals and at other times if a change in circumstances has occurred. The control of maximum prices (see paragraph 22) will be so exercised in relation to the sliding scale as to enable the dividend on Ordinary capital to be brought back, so far as practicable, to the standard rate, after each triennial period, with a qualification that any alteration in prices for that purpose must be such as will, so far as can be estimated, enable the Company to continue to earn the standard rate of dividend.S.O.
