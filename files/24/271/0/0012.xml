this document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;s government-Uiili &apos;;&apos;;5iuiu;;i.    Printed: for the. Cabinet. :September 1937.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 212 (37).CABINET.SITUATION IN THE FAR EAST.british Shipping in the Far East. Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE Japanese have stated informally that the &quot;blockade&quot; announced on the 25th August applied only to Chinese shipping, and not to vessels of third Powers, even carrying arms and ammunition, but that they must inspect ships suspected of being really Chinese. Two or three British ships have been stopped for verification of their status and allowed to proceed.It was decided at the meeting of Ministers on the 2nd September that British shipping should be advised to comply with a demand from a Japanese warship to stop in order that the British status of the vessel concerned might be verified. The formula agreed upon was : &quot; We should advise our shipping in the Far East That if a vessel flying the British flag which is suspected of being an impostor is requested to stop by a Japanese warship (a) If a British warship is present she has instructions on request to verify the right of the ship to fly the British flag;(b) If no British warship is present we shall not stand on our rights(if there is genuine reason to suspect that the vessel is an impostor) if they board the ship and examine the certificate of registry, provided that an immediate report is simultaneously made to the British Naval authorities;and that there should be added to this formula a provision to the effect that we reserved the right to claim compensation for damage sustained by the owners of British ships delayed or stopped under this procedure.&quot;It was decided not to make any notification to the Japanese, and the advice has not yet been issued to the British Shipping Companies, pending concurrence of the Dominion Governments, who are being consulted. (New Zealand has already concurred.) The French and United States Governments have been informed of the above decision.In the meanwhile, the Commander-in-Chief had already informed British shipping firms in the Far East that, pending consideration of the whole question of the position of British shipping, their ships should obey all orders received from Japanese warships and report on the circumstances afterwards.In making the statement mentioned in paragraph 1, the Japanese Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs said that, although the Japanese Government did not contemplate for the present taking action to prevent importation of arms and ammunition into China by third parties, &quot; future developments may compel the Japanese Government to devise more effective and suitable measures to stop all importation of arms and ammunition into China.&quot;9467   [15827]
2It might be questioned whether it:were better&quot;to irifbrmHhe Japanese that ;we will tolerate verification of British registry, but cannot admit any further interference, or simply to acquiesce tacitly in verification. In the former alternative, we might say that, as we have not been made aware that a state of war exists, we cannot admit any interference with British shipping, but that,.in the peculiar circumstances, we will admit the Japanese right to verify British registry, but that we can acquiesce in no further interference. It might be that a warning of the kind would deter the Japanese from proceeding to further measures, whereas, if they found that we tacitly acquiesced in verification, they might be encouraged to go further.On the other hand, if we made the notification to the Japanese, we should be explicitly granting them a right which they cannot properly claim. Now the immediate difficulty that is to be apprehended is that the Japanese may stop (for verification) a ship flying the British flag, owned by British subjects of Chinese race having dual nationality (of whom there are many such in Malaya and Hong Kong). Such persons are claimed as Chinese nationals by the Government of China. The Japanese might claim that the owners were Chinese and that the vessel had no real right to fly the British flag, and that, consequently, they could do what they liked with her. We should have a case that is not very easy to argue, and we should be on stronger ground if we were able to claim that we had never admitted the Japanese right to stop the vessel at all, even for purposes of verification only. :It has to be decided what action should be taken if the Japanese take further steps against British shipping than mere verification of their right to fly the British flag. The position can be regularised by declaring that in our view a state of war exists, even though neither the Japanese nor the Chinese admit that there is one; this would debar us from objecting to the full exercise of belligerent rights by the Japanese against British shipping and impose upon us the ordinary duties of neutrality, except (in the event of Article 17 of the Covenant being invoked) in so far as the observance of them would be contrary to the specific terms of Article 16 of the Covenant and to the sanctions which might be agreed upon in the given case. The application of the rules of neutrality would entail troublesome consequences and seriously interfere with British shipping in the Par East, and the Commander-in-Chief has pointed out that the present nebulous state of affairs is to our advantage as giving us free access to the coast of China and to British nationals.If we do not assert that in our view there is a state of war, the question arises of what we are to do if the Japanese do more than verify the status of British ships. Are we to submit or to protest, even though not intending to make our protest effective by resorting to measures of force if necessary ? There must be a point at which we should be obliged to take forcible action, but what it is has not been determined.A. E.Foreign Office, September 7, 1937.
