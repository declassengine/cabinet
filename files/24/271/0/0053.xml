C A B I N E T . Copy No. . .S E C R E.T. CP.  253  (37) EIRE BRIGADES BILL.Joint Memorandum &quot;by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland.1. We desire to have the assent of the Cabinet to ourproceeding,  as early as possible, with legislation to give effect to the main recommendations of the Riverdale Committee on the reorganisation of the Eire Brigade Services.      The terms of reference of the Committee did not extend beyond England and Wales, but their recommendations are broadly applicable to Scotland also and it is desirable that they should be given effect to in that country.     This legislation is not, primarily, emergency legislation, but has a bearing on the emergency measures, because these necessarily depend to a considerable extent for their effectiveness upon the soundness of the administrative machinery.2. It has been recognised for a long time that a- comprehensive Eire Brigade measure is overdue and the Riverdale Committee conducted a thorough investigation of the problem; their recommendations,  so far as regards measures of reorganisation, have met with general assent on the part of the local authorities in England and Wales, and there is no reason to Buppose that Scottish local authorities take a different view.     Various representations have been received urging early- legislation,  and the question will probably be raised when we meet the representatives of the local authorities on the 26th instant to discuss the arrangements for the grant of Exchequer assistanoe towards the oost of air raid precautions.3. There^is, however,  one point on which it will not be&apos;possible to follow the Riverdale Committee&apos;s recommendations,(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) .
namely,  that of finanoe.     The Committee recommended an Exchequer grant in aid of peace time as well as emergency expenditure:    hut the assistance now to he granted under the latter head is on so much greater a scale and so much more far reaching than was contemplated in the Committee&apos;s recommendations,  that their scheme of financial assistance has in any case gone by the board, and we think the local authorities may accept the view that the Exchequer will be bearing its full share of the fire brigade expenditure as a whole, without any special grant towards the peace time expenditure.     The strongest case for any exception is, we think,  in respect of the cost of administration of the co-operative measures for fire brigade co-operation over extended areas, which forms a part of the Riverdale Committee&apos;s scheme,  but this is a relatively minor detail which can be left to be dealt with in the course of the pending negotiations on the Exchequer assistance generally.4. The main heads of the Bill, which we suggest shouldbe introduced as early as possible in the House of Lords,  after consultation with representatives of the local authorities on administrative details, would be as follows:-(a) Eire Brigade Authorities to be in London, the County Council; elsewhere in England and Wales the Councils of County Boroughs, Boroughs and Urban Districts,as at present, but Rural District Councils to be Eire Brigade Authorities to the exclusion of the Parish Authorities; and in Scotland, County and Town Councils.(b) Eire Brigade Authorities to be under obligation (they are not at present except in London, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen) to provide effective fire brigade protection for their districts either on their own account, or jointly with another authority
-3-^7^or authorities,   or to arrange for it to he provided by another authority, this effective protection to cover what may be regarded as ordinary fires.(c) For the purpose of co-operation on a wider basis and for mutual support for dealing with exceptional fires, fire brigade districts and authorities to be grouped by areas,  delimited by a Statutory Commission for England and Wales, and by a similar Commission for Scotland.(d) A Scheme for the development of the Eire Brigade Services in each area, and for mutual support between the authorities,  to be prepared by a Board of local authorities&apos;  representatives for each area, with suitable technical assistance, the schemes to be subject to the approval of the Secretary of State: the Boards to be also responsible for supervising the operation of the area schemes.(e) The cost of services rendered on a co-operative basis,  i.e.,  outside the individual authorities&apos;  own districts, to be met from a joint Area Expenses Eund, raised by precept on the individual authorities.(f) The Secretary of State to have general supervisory-powers as respects the Service as a whole, and possibly limited default powers, e.g.,  as to the preparation of an Area Scheme;    with power also to appoint Inspectors, to call for reports and returns,  etc., and to make Regulations dealing with the government,  equipment and training of Eire Brigades,  etc.5. We shall be glad to have authority to prepare and submit to the Home Affairs Committee a Bill on these lines.22nd October, 1937.S.H. W .E .E .
