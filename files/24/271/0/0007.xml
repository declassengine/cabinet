THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   August 1937.SECRET. Copy No.    4 3CP. 207 (37).CABINET.RELATIONS WITH THE SALAMANCA GOVERNMENT.. Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues herewith a memorandum regarding our relations with the Salamanca Government. I have discussed,. with the Prime Minister, the general lines of the proposal made therein for an exchange of agents, and he is in agreement. I am anxious to take this step as soon as possible, and should be grateful if my colleagues would let me have any observations they wish to make by Wednesday evening next, the 1st September. If no observations are offered I propose to,proceed as suggested on Thursday, the 2nd September.A. E.August 26, 1937.Memorandum.I AM becoming seriously concerned at the unsatisfactory state of our relations with the Salamanca Government, and of the serious prejudice to British financial and commercial interests which is resulting from our inability to establish proper contacts with that Government.Apart from British interests in the Canary Islands and in Spanish Morocco, both of which are under control of General Franco, there are approximately  20 million sterling of British capital invested in Spanish mainland territory occupied by him. The greater part of this is in respect of iron ore, copper and lead mines, and the sherry industry. These interests are at present suffering very severely from the attitude of the Salamanca authorities towards His Majesty&apos;s Government. By the requisition of minerals for export, interference in the running of mines, forced levies, refusal to allow the return of British subjects to Bilbao to protect British interests there, lack of sterling allocation to the sherry industry, the application of the financial agreement in regard to the disposal of sterling, and by commercial difficulties of every sort, these British interests have been brought to a very critical situation, demanding expert and frequent negotiation with the Salamanca authorities.There is, however, at present no machinery for such negotiation. During the last eight months the commercial secretary at Hendaye has made four or five visits to Salamanca and Burgos to discuss matters of commercial interest. It was only as a result of this occasional personal contact that any progress or settlement could be reached. Recently, as a result of strained relations between General Franco and His Majesty&apos;s Government, even this contact has been very occasional and fortuitous. It has therefore become impossible to give any satisfaction to the constant enquiries and complaints of British firms concerned, and it has become necessary almost to admit openly that a complete deadlock has been reached in all these matters owing to lack of contact with Salamanca. 9450   [15779]
Similar difficulties are being experienced in regard to maritime matters and the naval policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government. The Salamanca Government have at present in their possession four British ships which were seized in territorial waters when attempting to enter Santander, and whose detention is contrary to principles which we recognise. Owing to their unwillingness to afford His Majesty&apos;s Embassy at Hendaye the courtesies which would normally be enjoyed by a diplomatic mission, we are unable to obtain any satisfaction through that channel in regard to these ships, and are now faced with the alternatives of using, or threatening to use, a considerable degree of force to obtain the release of the ships, after having refrained from using the much lesser force which would originally have been necessary to prevent their capture in territorial waters, or on the other hand, of tacitly permitting the exercise by the insurgents of what is in fact one of the principal rights of belligerency, namely, the condemnation of neutral ships for breach of blockade. These cases concern not only British shipowners, but also insurance underwriters and those interested in the evacuation of refugees. In addition, the Salamanca authorities have for several months been in possession of two valuable cargoes of iron ore, and all the efforts of Sir Henry Chilton to obtain their release have been unavailing.The principal ground for this obstructive and unsatisfactory attitude of the Salamanca Government is that they resent being treated as if they did not exist, and are endeavouring to force us to recognise them by refusing to allow us the advantages of diplomatic representation in their territory unless we give them similar advantages. No doubt, also, they are endeavouring to use this situation in order to force us into recognising their belligerent status, but a large part of the difficulty is one of contact and mutual understanding. The Embassy at Hendaye has been used by us almost exclusively as a channel for protests, demands and claims in regard to incidents at sea, and this has contributed to the present habit of the Salamanca Government not to reply to the Embassy&apos;s communications except occasionally in an offhand manner which gives no satisfaction.The Salamanca Government feel strongly that, so long as they themselves enjoy none of the advantages of diplomatic or consular representation in the United Kingdom, it is unreasonable that we should enjoy these privileges in their territory. For the same reason, although they have not been officially approached in the matter, they have indicated they would be unwilling to allow us to appoint consuls to replace Mr. Stevenson at Bilbao or Mr. Oxley at Vigo, and our consul at Seville is now the only British career consul in insurgent-territory. The inconvenience of this state of affairs to us cannot be exaggerated, but it has to be recognised that General Franco&apos;s Government suffer similar disability in the United Kingdom. Spaniards with known pro-Franco sympathies have no one in the United Kingdom to protect their interests. Crews and masters of Franco ships calling at our ports are without the assistance of consuls, while the activities of the officially recognised Spanish consuls are often detrimental to their interests, and, what is more, the Salamanca Government have no means of explaining their policy to His Majesty&apos;s Government. In matters affecting general British policy, and in particular the policy of the Non-intervention Committee, they are compelled to rely on the Italians and Germans for their views, and their attitude bears the stamp of that school. Being without any of the facilities enjoyed by the Spanish Government for presenting its case and defending its interests in this country, they feel justified in refusing to treat our diplomatic and consular officers in their territory as if they were the representa-tives of a Government in friendly relations with them.For this reason I have come to the conclusion that it is essential, in view of the heavy British interests involved and the important issues at stake between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Salamanca Government, that new contacts should be devised. I therefore propose that we should inform General Franco that we are prepared to accept an agent of his in London in exchange for the establishment of a British agent at Salamanca. In making this communication, I would propose to explain that such an arrangement would not, in our eyes, constitute formal recognition of General Franco&apos;s Government, and that we should not therefore grant, or expect to receive, full diplomatic status for the agents. They would, however, of course, have the right of confidential communication, and General Franco&apos;s agent in London would have free access to the Foreign Office. The proposal would also include an exchange of consular; agents in ports and other towns where necessary.
The following seem to me to be the advantages of making this proposal at the present time:  * &apos;;(1) The principal objective of General Franco is no doubt to obtain recog-nition of his belligerent status. At the present time, however, we are able to argue that this question, being still under international discussion in the Non-intervention Committee as part of a larger proposal, is not one which we can consider independently.(2) Sir Henry Chilton has emphasised that the Salamanca authorities appear now to be in a favourable mood for receiving a limited proposal of this sort, which does not grant them either of the objects which they mainly desire, namely, belligerency and full recognition. But he feels that if they have further military successes, they may become less willing to accept a half-measure of this kind.I feel that this proposal could be defended in the House of Commons and publicly on the grounds that the establishment of such machinery is essential for the protection of British interests and for maintaining contact with, and getting satisfaction from, General Franco&apos;s Government in the important issues, such as the protection of shipping, which are at stake. , I would propose to state, in making this communication to General Franco, that one of the results which we should expect to follow from the exchange of agents would be a general under-standing in regard to shipping matters and, in particular, the release of the four British ships which are at present under detention.A.
