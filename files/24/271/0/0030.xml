(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)5 secret. Copy No.&apos;./.....&quot; CABINET. -CP.  230 (37)PROHIBITION OF POLITICAL PROCESSIONS IN LONDON.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.1. My colleagues will wish to read the attachedminute that the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police has sent me in connection with the Fascist demonstration on Sunday last,  October 3rd,  and the counter-move of the Communists that it provoked.2. Whilst there was general approval at the action that was taken in not extending the existing, ban so as to stop the procession, it seems to me desirable to reconsider the present position in the light of last Sunday&apos;s events. 3. I am certain to be pressed with Questions on thesubject when the House reassembles, and I shall be glad to know how the minds of my colleagues are moving before I have to deal with them.4. I am advised that to extend the prohibition overthe whole Metropolitan area would be to stretch unduly the provisions of the Act, and that if such an extension were desired, amending legislation would almost certainly be necessary.      I should be averse from introducing legislation of this kind if I were not satisfied that the Party Leaders and the House of Commons generally approved of it.      If, however, there was a general feeling that peaceful citizens should be spared the trouble and turmoil of the Bermondsey demonstration,  I should welcome it.      I suggest that the first step is to sound the Party Leaders as to their attitude towards extension of the Act.S.H.7th October, 1937.
259NEW SCOTLAND YARD,  S .W . 1.Secretary of State.1.      In view of the disorders which occurred in Bermondsey on October 3rd the question arises as to whether any further restrictive action.on processions is (a) necessary and (b) desirable.I can see no reason to expect that the Fascists will not organise further marhhes.      They have nothing to lose by doing so.      Police protection must be given or they would be over-whelmed by numbers with many casualties and almost certainly some fatalities.      Their orderly behaviour and obedience to police directions enable them to claim,  anyhow with apparent justification, that it is their opponents who create all the trouble, and to pose as a party of law and order in contrast with one of hooligan violence.Equally, I see no reason to think that opposition to Fascist marches will not continue.     The official Labour Party and the Borough authorities lent no support to active opposition on October 3rd and restrained their own followers with considerable success.     But the Communist Party,  the Trades Councils and the Independent Labour Party went as far as they were advised they could, without being successfully prosecuted, in organising ostensibly passive resistance, which inevitably developed, and always will develop, into active resistance leading to disorder.2. If therefore the position is allowed to remain as at present we must, I am convinced, expect further disorders. While I anticipate that we shall, for a time at all events, be able to prevent serious rioting of a widespread character, the task is likely to become more difficult on each subsequent occasion. We have already tried forbidding the procession at the last moment, October 4th 1936 - banning processions in a
Sispecial area - escorting the procession along its published route to Trafalgar Square, where the necessity for previous permission to hold a meeting justified us in keeping an area clear,  July 4th 1937 - and a last minute diversion of the procession to an alternative meeting place near that intended, October 3rd 1937.      It will not be possible to employ a fresh technique on every occasion and disorders will inevitably tend to become more serious.3.    I would therefore urge a reconsideration of the whole question of processions in the public streets, and of whether there is any substantial support for them.      Processions may have been a necessary method of allowing the citizens to make their views known when the vote was very restricted, but with adult suffrage this is clearly no longer necessary.      And they are of course far more inconvenient nowadays than even 40 or 50 years ago, owing to the enormously increased population and traffic congestion in the streets.      The processional habit is almost entirely confined to the more extreme political elements, whose numbers are comparatively infinitesimal.     The Communist Party of Great Britain numbers well under 15,000 and the British Union of Fascists under 5,000.     And between them they organise almost all the processions that take place and all those which cause disorder.     Moreover,  except in the predominantly Jewish district of the East End, those who collect on the route of the procession with a view to active intervention, as apart from sightseeing, are not residents but are either keen supporters from other districts or hooligans from anywhere.      Of the 113 individual arrested on October 3rd, only 38 came from Bermondsey and adjacent Boroughs south of the Thames.      The remaining 69 came from no less than 14 of the remaining 19 Metropolitan Police Divisions, 1 from the City of London and 5 from places as far apart as Bucks, Kent,  Sussex and Lancashire.The same applies to the Fascists.      The supporters of both
factions are in effect very much like a stage army collecting wherever trouble is likely and giving a grossly exaggerated idea of their total numbers.The position is really Gilbertian.      On October 3rd,  2500 Police had to be employed to enable the Fascists, numbering   some 3,000,  to march through an area where they were not wanted to a meeting place where,  in order to protect them from violence, their meeting had to be segregated to such an extent that hardly a single individual, except those who marched with Oswald Mosley, can have heard one word he said.     For any possible effect his speech had on those outside his movement,  it might just as well have been delivered at the rallying point of the procession in Millbank.4.    I have carefully considered my powers to impose conditions on a procession under Section 3(l) of the Public Order Act 1936, but without stretching them far beyond their intended application I cannot see any way of making them effective. Prescribing a route, prohibiting banners, making conditions as to time and so on, will obviously not prevent disorder in the face of determined opposition.      If one stretched the power to prohibit the procession from entering any specified public place to cover all the streets leading away from the rallying point, this would effectively stop its movement.      But it would in effect be merely banning the procession by a roundabout method, and hence very open to criticism and would throw on the authorities the invidious duty of deciding as between one procession and another.I have also considered the possibility of informing Sir Oswald Mosley when next he announces his intention of holding a march that no additional police will be employed on the route. I think this would call his bluff in all probability as he might hestitate to expose his followers to the violence of their far
more numerous opponents.     But if he retaliated by calling our bluff and adhering to his arrangements we should &quot;be awkwardly placed.5.   As between the Fascists and their opponents there is nothing to choose.      The Fascists deliberately provoke opposition by choosing meeting places and routes to them which will obviously incite their opponents to interference.      (I have inside evidence that this is their avowed intention).     Broadly speaking, during the march they are entirely lawabiding and use no violence either against their opponents or the Police.The Communists accept the Pascist challenge and oppose them with violence, which must and does lead to clashes with the PoliceApart from the disturbance to the peace of London,  and its 8 million inhabitants, and to the very real inconvenience caused to traffic of all descriptions by the silly vagaries of a tiny minority, their processions result in the withdrawal of very large numbers of Police on each occasion from other localities whose citizens are paying for local Police protection.      There has been a marked rise in housebreaking,  shopbreaking and larceny during the last 12 months and while it is difficult to assign causes,  there can be little doubt that the withdrawal of Police in connexion with processions has contributed.6.    Marches and processions by bodies other than the Communist Party and the Fascists are comparatively very few in number and though what opposition there was to a ban on all marches would be very vocal,  I doubt if it would get much support from any large numbers of people if the case for a ban was fully and carefully presented and given adequate publicity.      There have been a good many indications that official Labour would support the policy and the very large public which has no strong party views would almost certainly do so.
5th October, 1937.Section 3(3)  of the Public Order Act gives power to ban all processions or any class of processions in the whole of the Metropolitan Police Area and though its use to that extent was deprecated in debate, the present state of public feeling on the matter indicates,  I think,  that it would be accepted as a wise precaution.I feel therefore that a general ban should be imposed under the Act on all political processions for three months, and that this should be done as soon as possible while the events of October 3rd are still fresh in the public mind.     And further, that during the currency of the ban,  the advisability of legislation making processions of all kinds in the streets illegal once and for all should be carefully considered.      State ceremonials and the like would of course not be affected.(Signed)    PHILIP GAME. .Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis.
