On the recommendation of a Sub-Committee appointed to consider     43 various proposals for improving the conditions of service of the soldier, the Vocational Cabinet decided* early this year that the existing provision for vocational    1452 training for men leaving the Colours should be expanded, that such expansion should be carried out by the Ministry of Labour as an extension of their existing training scheme, and that training should take place immediately after, instead of before, the termination of the men&apos;s Colour service.   It was hoped that in this way it would be possible to ensure that all men at present eligible would be given an opportunity. of vocational training in a suitable trade immediately after discharge from the Army, subject to the capacity of industry to absorb them.2. Prominence was given to this change in the Secretary of State&apos;s speech in introducing Army Estimates, 1937, and in the Press, and, though there was some criticism in the House at the time of Estimates of the transfer of the work to the Ministry of Labour, it was hoped that this promise of vocational training for a much larger proportion of the Army would prove a valuable aid to recruit-ing.3. As a temporary arrangement it was agreed with the Ministry of Labour that the War Office should continue to administer the existing 3 Army centres. Men at these centres have continued to be trained as soldiers prior to discharge, their service, if necessary, being extended for the purpose, and have received the normal military rates of pay and allowances. It was the intention to transfer the centres at Hounslow and Chisledon to the Ministry of Labour with effect from 1st April, 1938. Fees were abolished at Army centres with effect from 1st April, 1937-4. The Ministry of Labour proposed to allot to the training of men on leaving the Colours two centres, Southampton immediately and Leeds when ready  probably before the end of this year and in addition a number of vacancies at centres at which civilians were being trained: the whole amounting in the aggregate to some 5,000 vacancies in the year ending 31st March, 1938.    The ,ex-soldiers at the Ministry of Labour centres were to be treated&quot; just as any other civilian trainees and were to receive normal Unemployment Benefit plus training allowance and dependants&apos; allowance, totalling 19s. a week for a single man living at home or 22s. a week if away from home, or for a married man 28s. and 43s. respectively, with the addition of 3s. a week for each child. Financially, except in a minority of cases, these terms are less favourable than the military emoluments drawn at Army Vocational Training Centres. Moreover, the time spent at the Ministry of Labour centres would count against the period for which a man would be eligible to draw unemployment benefit.* Cabinet 2 (37): Conclusion 4.
5. Unfortunately the scheme has failed. Despite every effort by the Army authorities to popularize the scheme the soldier has shown himself unwilling to accept training at the Ministry of Labour centres. Out of a total of about 5,000 vacancies available, only 672 acceptances have been notified, and some of these are at present doubtful. This is believed to be due partly to psycho-logical reasons, the soldier disliking the idea of being &quot; on the dole &quot;, and partly to the fact that the majority of soldiers are financially better off under the Army scheme where they receive military pay and allowances, than under the Ministry of Labour scheme where they receive allowances as above. But whatever may be the reason the fact remains that the men will not at present go to Ministry of Labour centres, though there is little doubt that had the arrangements under which vocational training was offered been acceptable to the men there would have been a ready response to the offer.6. The trooping season has now opened, and some 11,000 soldiers will be arriving home to take their discharge by 31st March, of whom perhaps 7-8,000 will be eligible for vocational training. Only a limited number (say, 1,000-1,500) can be accommodated at the Army centres, and of the rest only 646 (included in the figure of 672 above) have applied to take a vocational training course at a Ministry of Labour centre.7. The failure of the scheme (though that scheme has been widely adver-&apos; used) will not only adversely affect recruiting but will undoubtedly give rise to considerable political and public criticism. It is, therefore, urgently neces-sary to devise some means by which the men now returning from abroad may be encouraged to take advantage of the facilities offered. As a result of inter-departmental discussion between the Treasury, the Ministry of Labour and the War Office, it is proposed as a temporary expedient that these men should attend the Ministry of Labour centres not as civilians but as soldiers in receipt of their ordinary military emoluments, their service being extended where necessary for this purpose. The period of training will not count against the period for which the men will subsequently be eligible for Unemployment Benefit. The centres will continue to be under the Ministry of Labour control, though arrangements will be made as may be necessary by the War Office for the administrative work of pay, allowances, discharges, etc. It is hoped that this concession will dispose of the financial difficulty, which has prevented a large number of men from accepting a course of vocational training at a Ministry of Labour centre. It is true that a minority of cases (broadly speaking the married man under 26 years of age) will lose by the change, but as they will be drawing the same emoluments as they would be if at an Army centre their grievance is not a substantial one and the change will be of real general advantage.8. Whether a psychological difficulty, due to the fact that the men though not &quot; on the dole &quot; will be trained under a scheme associated in their minds with the unemployed, will continue to militate against the success of the scheme is uncertain. It is therefore suggested that the proposal should be regarded and described as an experiment, the results of which can be judged in six months&apos; time. If it is successful it can be continued: if unfortunately it proves a failure, the matter can be further considered.9. The legislative powers of the Ministry of Labour are restricted to training unemployed persons, but in the Treasury view the powers of the War Office to give industrial training to serving soldiers may be exercised by the Ministry of Labour acting, as agents of the War Office. It is important that steps should be taken at once to give effect to the proposed scheme in order that the soldiers arriving home from abroad within the next few weeks may be dealt with under it, and the Cabinefs authority for this is requested. In order that Parliament may be fully informed of the arrangement, it will be necessary for the Ministry of Labour to submit to Parliament a Supplementary Estimate for provision of the necessary money with Appropriations-in-Aid from Army Funds. Any payment to the Ministry of Labour by the War Office for the cost of training would not increase the Exchequer charge. Pending the approval of such an Estimate, the Treasury have agreed to make the required funds available from the Civil Contingencies Fund.
(B37/8)   70   10/37   w.o.p.   1256io. Exclusive of the cost to the Ministry of Labour (which cost is provided for in the 1937 Estimates on the basis of training the men as civilians), the cost to Army Funds in respect of extensions of service, pay and allowances, etc., is estimated to be  250,000, while there will ultimately be a countervailing saving on payments made to the Unemployment Fund from Army Votes of  90,000, and a consequential saving of  45,000 on account of the Exchequer contribution to the Fund. There will also be a saving estimated at  100,000 in respect of training allowances which would have been paid by the Ministry of Labour.11. I would ask for immediate authority to proceed on the lines proposed.L. H.-B.The War Office, 18th October, 1937.
