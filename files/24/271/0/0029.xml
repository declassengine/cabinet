(THIS    DOCUMENT    IS    THE    PROPERTY   OF HIS    BRITANNIC   MAJEST YfS    GOVERNMENT).SECRET. COPY   NO.   . ff.l . . .CP.229(57) .CABINET.FERTILITY STATISTICS .Memorandum by the Minister of Health and the Secretary ofState for Scotland.1.     In view of the importance of the population problem, and the urgent need for additional &quot;fertility&quot; statistics, we seek the concurrence of our colleagues in the introduction of legislation (on the lines of the Census Act, 1920) providing for Orders in Council which may prescribe particulars, to be obtained confidentially for statistical purposes only, on the occasion of registration of births, deaths, stillbirths and marriages.     The scope of such particulars would be specified in a Schedule to the Act, which would cover fertility statistics and other matters which might prove necessary to throw light on the birth-.rate problem.2.      Special attention has, for some time been given (by the Registrars-General and by various voluntary organisations)  to the statistical aspects of the matter)  and to the development of a further body of statistical evidence as a basis for the proper consideration of this problem and the formulation of Government policy.     Furthermore,  in the debate in the House of Commons on Mr. Cartland&apos;s motion on 10th February and on other occasions Parliament has shown a lively interest, and has made clear a general desire for investigation of the factors causing a decline in the birth-rate.      Accordingly mention was made during the debates on the Ministry of Health estimates on 8th and 18th June of the possibility of securing the necessary additional information by way of confidential particulars supplied to
registrars for which legislation would be necessary;    and Mr. Greenwood and other Members of Parliament expressed their agreement with this course.3.     The principal need is for statistics demonstrating, so far as possible, the conditions encouraging or discouraging the production of the larger families.      There are no current fertility statistics for this country, and no material exists from which they,could he compiled.     Birth rate statistics have, hitherto, had to rely wholly upon the information contained in the birth register, which does not include in England any of the needed &quot;fertility&quot; material, viz., the ages of the parents,  the date or duration of the marriage, and the numbers and particulars of previous issue of the marriage. The date of marriage already appears in the Scottish Birth Register, but not the ages of parents, or numbers etc. of previous children.     Stillbirths are not registered in Scotland.4.      The alternative to obtaining information by the registration method is the Census.      There will be no Census before 1941;    and the results of a Census fertility enquiry cannot be available for some 6 or 7 years.      The decennial interval is too long to meet the requirements of public interest in this subject;    and from technical statistical aspects also the registration treatment of the subject, building up annually a continuous body of statistics,  is much to be preferred.      The Census is, moreover,  already very heavily loaded.5.      The additional work involved in the use of the registration procedure would proportionately increase the time needed for it from local registrars;    this would involve an increase in the registration expenses of County and County Borough Councils to which the Block Grant under the Local Government Act, 1929, is nominally applicable.     But as under Section 135 of that Act and Section 78 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act, 1929, increased Exchequer assistance is
contemplated only in the event of &quot;material additional expenditure being imposed  ..4 by reason of the institution of a new ... service&quot; it is not considered that an addition to the Block Grant would be necessary.     Some further financial provision would be necessary in the Tote for the General Register Office for the contemplated work on fertility statistics not exceeding about  6,000 annually,  and a corresponding sum not exceeding about  1,000 annually in the Vote for the Registrar-General1s Office  (Scotland).6.     The Treasury have been consulted and agree with the proposals now submitted.K.W. W.E.October 7th, 1937.
