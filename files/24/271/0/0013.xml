CABINEToSituation;,.;.., in m^the   Mediterranean.) - mgj!^jgs^...liy. Seerstary of State for Foreign Affairs.It is possible that as a result of the recent Soviet Note addressed to Italy, the Italian Government will refuse to attend the proposed Mediterranean Conference.      This will entail the refusal of Germany, and probably also the modification of the type of proposals to which the Conference,  thus restricted, could be expected to agree.      It is necessary, therefore,  to contemplate the circumstance of a smaller conference which Italy and Germany would not attend and to examine the measures which His Majesty&apos;s Government could then take in conjunction with any other Powers who were willing to co-operate in putting an end to the sinking of merchant shipssProposals had been worked out by the Admiralty and the Foreign Office under which the two parties in Spain should be informed that their submarines must in future be confined to port, and that failure to carry out this measure would render them liable to be sunko      As a logical consequence of this restriction upon the movements of Spanish submarines, and in view of the possibility of non-Spanish submarines being sunk in error, it was further proposed that the whole of the Mediterranean should be closed to all submarines, with the exception of certain limited areas deemed necessary for exercises off the naval ports of the Powers concerned.In view of the probable refusal of the Italian Government to attend the proposed Conference, it may no longer be possible to proceed with the above proposalr which involves the co-operation of all the Mediterranean Powers,,
Further consideration has heen given by the Foreign Office and the Admiralty as to what measures it is possible for this country to takey  in conjunction with other Powers who may be disposed to acto      Such measures must clearly depend upon the naval forces available as to which the First Sea Lord has submitted the following views:-&quot;The First Sea Lord is of opinion that it is important to impress on the French privately that the British Naval peace strength in Destroyers available for operating in the Mediterranean is strictly limited. If operations are to be carried out over a period of several month so      Assuming that all the Destroyers in the Mediterranean and Home Fleets are devoted to the task of keeping down submarine piracy in the Mediterranean some thirty destroyers on the average will be available?      Operating in two reliefs this would limit the number of Destroyers actually employed at any one time to fifteen.The First Sea Lord feels strongly that If the British Navy is asked to do any task of this public nature it should be able to do it efficiently,      At present our Destroyers are acting singly so as to be spread over as large an area as possible.,      A single Destroyer cannot deal effectively with a Submarine.      He therefore proposes to divide the fifteen Destroyers available at any one time into five or six groups. It is obvious that these five or six groups could only cover a limited area, whereas we nave to consider the whole of the French frontier, the Malta Channel, the coast of Greece and the Aegean.      Re therefore wishes it to be clearly understood that no scheme can be fully effective.
It is also important that the French Navy shall play an active and not inconsiderable part,      The Russian Navy might at the same time he asked if they were prepared to watch any area in the Aegean,      Although it would he most undesirable to allocate publicly any particular area to any one country, it would be necessary, to avoid incidents, that the staffs of the countries concerned should have some mutual understanding in the matter.      The French Navy might be asked; for instance,  to operate generally in the Western Basin north of the 40th parallel,  the British Navy south of that parallel, and the Russian, Greek or Turkish Navies     the Aegean,      Failing the Russian, Greek or Turkish Navies being willing to do this, British forces would have to be sent to the Aegean as necessary.The First Sea Lord was also concerned with the question of bases for British Destroyers.      At present they are using Spanish ports? both Insurgent and Government, which greatly reduces the strain on personnel and increases the time which they can be available at sea.      It is strongly desirable from the British Fleet&apos;s point of view to avoid any action which would cause the two Spanish belligerents to deny the use of their ports to our forces,,      If Spanish ports ceased to be available, it would be important that the French should give us the use of Algiers.A further point is that a time limit should be placed in the first instance on the period of the operation.    This can always be extended if necessary but if no time limit is laid down we are committed indefinitely and,  in the quite probable event of submarine operations ceasing, our vessels might be employed for months on fruitless patrol duties.11
In view of the considerations outlined above it would appear desirable for His Majesty&apos;s Government to endeavour to secure agreement at the conference on the following general proposals:(i)    That in view of the piratical acts carried out bysubmarines in the Mediterranean against the shipping of various countries, the Powers concerned shall give instructions to their naval forces to take the action indicated in (ii) and (iii) below with a view to the protection of all shipping.(ii)    That any submarine attacking a merchant ship in a manner contrary to the rules as to the action of sub-marines with regard to merchant ships contained in the Proces-Verbal signed in London on the 6th November 1936, is to be counter-attacked and, if possible,  destroyed.(iii)    This instruction extends to any submarine in thevicinity of a position in which a merchant ship has recently been attacked or sunk.(iv)    The above instruction shall remain in force until changed but would be reviewed monthly.It is clearly desirable that at some stage, the earlier the better. Germany and Italy should be asked to co-operate, in the event of their not attending the Conference.7th September, 1957.-iv-
