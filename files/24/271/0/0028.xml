Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1937.SECRET. Copy No. 43CP. 228 (37).CABINET.RELATIONS WITH THE IRISH FREE STATE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I CIRCULATE an account of two conversations which I had with Mr. de Valera in Geneva. I apologise for the great length of the paper, but I think that a shorter summary would be insufficient to convey his state of mind regarding the various questions involved. Reading through this account again now I think that, although it reproduces accurately the substance of Mr. de Valera&apos;s arguments, it does not succeed in reproducing the friendly spirit in which these firm arguments were stated. I am convinced that he is really genuine in desiring whole-hearted friendship and co-operation between the Irish Free State and Great Britain, but would rather like to get that friendship on his own terms.I have since had a further conversation with him in London, which was slightly less discouraging regarding the financial dispute. I will circulate an account of this talk in the course of the next two or three days.I propose to prepare a paper on the whole situation for consideration, in the first place, by the Irish Situation Committee.M. M.October 6, 1937.I had two long informal conversations regarding the disputes between the Irish Free State and this country with Mr. de Valera whilst we were both in Geneva.  The following is a summary of the talks : Irish Free State Constitutional Legislation.I reminded him that on the last occasion when we met we had a long talk about the legislation which he had passed through the Dail at the time of King Edward&apos;s abdication, and his plans regarding his proposed new Constitution for the Irish Free State. That talk had been very useful in so far as it enabled me to understand more clearly what he had in mind and the significance which he attached to his legislation, and to pass this information on to .my colleagues. The legislation had not been satisfactory from our point of view, but at least the talk had enabled us to understand better the situation. Since then he had introduced his new Constitution; it had passed through the Dail, but had not yet come into operation. I supposed that it would do so automatically, as provided for in the Act, at the end of six months, as it would now seem unlikely that the Dail would pass a special Resolution bringing it into effect before that date.Mr. de Valera replied that the position would probably be so. Whether the Constitution was to be brought into operation by a Dail Resolution before the six months was up would depend on the attitude which the Dail adopted towards certain further legislation which would have to be passed before the Constitution came into effect. There were a Bill making provision for the election of the President, a Bill regarding the Second Chamber, and other Bills still to be put [15940] this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
on the Statute Book. He himself anticipated that the six-months period would elapse, which meant that the new Constitution would come into effect at the very end of the present year.I said that I did not propose in these present talks to make general or detailed comments on the Constitution. The Cabinet had not yet had an opportunity of considering its provisions, and therefore I could not say what our attitude would be. I would like, if he agreed, to discuss with him in these conver-sations the other outstanding questions between our two countries. But with regard to the Constitution, there were one or two questions which I would like to ask him, and then there was one observation on certain Articles in the Constitution which I must make.In the first place, he would remember telling me in our earlier talks that when the new Constitution had been passed, the External Relations Act confirming the King&apos;s functions in the external affairs of the Irish Free State would remain on the Statute Book as a sort of partner to the Constitution Act. Could we assume that this plan held good ? Mr. de Valera replied in the affirmative. I then said that he would remember telling me that he had it in mind to give the External Relations Act a status somewhat similar to that enjoyed by the Constitution Act, so that it would be as difficult to alter the former Act as to alter the latter; he had contemplated that the same machinery of referendum, &amp;c, would be required in cither case. I had understood him on that occasion to say that the same would apply to a number of Acts which had a special relation to the Constitution, a group of legislation which he had described as &quot; organic Acts.&quot; Was it still his intention to group the External Relations Act with these others and to give them all that privileged status ?Mr. de Valera replied that he had changed his mind. On looking into the matter carefully he had found it hard to select which Acts should enjoy this special status and which should not; it was difficult to draw the line between one piece of legislation and another. Moreover, if he were to make such a proposal regarding the External Relations Act, there would be a debate in the Dail which might re-open the whole question of the provisions of that Act. As I knew, the confirmation of the King&apos;s functions in external affairs had aroused a great deal of criticism amongst his own supporters. He was reluctant to reopen the question, and therefore had decided to leave the Act on the Statute Book just as it was. He added that he did not think this would make any difference to its permanence. There would be no alteration in the provisions of the External Relations Act. He thought that those provisions would stand for as long a time as he could foresee in the future. Indeed, he regarded the Constitutional question as settled. There was only one matter which troubled him a bit, and which he might approach me about later on : that was the form in which Irish Free State passports were made out at the present time. There was a mention of the King in the formal request at the beginning of the passports. People in the Free State were always urging him to alter this; the matter was constantly being raised by people who required passports; and the matter might become a real nuisance. He had not had time to look into the point carefully, and therefore he was not raising it formally with me now. He might not need to raise it at all, but he would like me to keep the matter at the back of my mind, lest he did at some time in the future. Otherwise, he could see no Constitutional point with regard to which he would want to suggest any further alteration, and the King would continue to exercise all the functions regarding external affairs which he did at present.I replied that I would make a mental note of the passport point, which I understood that he was not now actually raising. But I should like to say two things on the matter which he could also keep at the back of his mind if he were giving the matter further consideration. First, I hoped that he would not raise the question at all, and that the passports could be kept as they were at present. There was, of course, a mention of the King in them, just as there was in the case of passports in all the Dominions. Passports were concerned with external affairs, and Mr. de Valera&apos;s recent legislation had confirmed the King&apos;s functions regarding those affairs. It was therefore in accordance with the spirit of his own legislation that the King should be specifically mentioned in this case. There would be very strong criticism in the United Kingdom of any alteration. Secondly, if he did want to make any alteration in the passports, I hoped that he would discuss the matter with us first.   It would be most unfortunate if he made
a change without warning and consultation with us. I did not anticipate that we could consent to any change, but, in any case, it would be far better if we could try to settle the matter, one way or the other, by agreement.Mr. de Valera replied that he was not sure what his rights were in this matter. It might be that the Irish Free State Government had the right to alter the form of passports without consulting us. But even if that was the position, he would much rather make the change after consultation and, if possible, in agreement with us. He would bear in mind what I had said, and repeated that he had not made up his mind one way or the other.I repeated that I had no general observations to make at present regarding the new Constitution. The matter had still to be considered by the Cabinet. But there was one comment which I would wish to make at once. I wondered what Articles 2 and 3* of the Constitution were intended to convey. It seemed to me that they suggested that the Irish Free State Government and Parliament had some right to make laws for the Six Counties. If that was the idea, I must say that we in the United Kingdom could not admit any such right. The Six Counties were in no sense a part of the Irish Free State; they were a part of the United Kingdom; they were within the province of other legislatures, not within the province of the Dail; we could no more admit that the Irish Free State had rights of the nature suggested in that or any part of the United Kingdom than that foreign countries had similar rights in any part of the United Kingdom.Mr. de Valera answered that the Articles stated what were facts. The national territory of the Irish people was the whole island of Ireland with its territorial waters and isles. No one would deny that. The statements in those Articles placed on record his people&apos;s ultimate objective of uniting the territory of the Irish people. The Irish people had a right to government over the whole of their territory. He felt it necessary to make that statement on behalf of the Irish people in the Constitution Act; indeed, if he had not made it, he would not have got the Constitution through the Dail. It was true that the Dail to-day exercised powers over a more limited area. He thought the distinction was made quite clearly in the Articles to which I referred. I would notice that the first few Articles of the Constitution were printed under the general heading of &quot; The Nation/5 and the rest under the general heading of &quot; The State.&quot; &quot; The Nation &quot; included the whole area of Ireland, but &quot; The State &quot; was confined for the present to the Twenty-Six Counties.I said that we in the United Kingdom could not prevent him or the Dail from stating their own view of what their rights were. But where any such declaration conflicted with what we held to be our rights, we would make our position clear. The fact was that the Irish Free State authorities had no rights of legislation whatever over any part of Northern Ireland. No court of law in the world, at any rate outside the Irish Free State, would entertain such a notion. Northern Ireland was a part of another State.The Financial Dispute.I said that there were certain questions which I wished to ask him in order to get at his mind on the details of the financial dispute. I reminded him that he had said publicly on various occasions that his Government would never pay a penny of the Land Annuities. We in the United Kingdom could not accept that position; in our view those payments were properly owing to us.Mr. de Valera interrupted to ask whether I had ever gone carefully into the history of this matter. He himself had examined it thoroughly, and indeed his principal adviser on it had been an eminent Unionist lawyer, no political friend of his own. He had not made any public statement regarding the Land Annuities until his examination of the question had been completed and he had satisfied himself that there was no justification whatever for the payments being made to the United Kingdom Government. He thought that if I went into the matter conscientiously I would agree.* Article 2.-The national territory consists of the whole island of Ireland, its islands, and the territorial seas.   .   &apos;Article 3. Pending the re-integration of the national territory, and without prejudice to the right of the Parliament and Government established by this Constitution to exercise jurisdiction over the whole of that territory, the laws enacted by that Parliament shall have the like area and extent of application as the laws of Saorst&amp;t Eireann and the like extra-territorial effect.[15940] b 2
I replied that discussion of that aspect at this moment would be fruitless. Even if there was something to be said for his point of view, which I did not admit, that was beside the point. Throughout the present dispute we had based our right to the money on the Agreements which we had signed with the Irish Free State Government. When Mr. de Valera came into office we would have been ready to listen to the argument which he had just made, if he had wished to make it. In the course of discussion it was even possible that he would have persuaded us that there was some justification in his contention, and in that case we would no doubt have been ready to modify the Financial Agreements. What had been wrong was his unilateral repudiation of the Agreements. It was surely indisputable that an Agreement between two Governments remained in force and could not properly be altered unless the two Governments mutually agreed on the alteration.   The proper procedure would have been discussion and negotiation.Mr. de Valera replied that he.could not agree that the Agreements between the two Governments were properly concluded. The Irish Free State was a democratic State; in such a country an Agreement to be effective must have the assent of the proper representative institution; the Agreements ought to have been brought before the Dail.I answered that the method of giving proper authority to the Agreements in the Irish Free State was nothing to do with us. We had signed the Agreements with the fully accredited representatives of the Irish Free State Government. Whether they were to present the Agreements to their Parliament, or in what form they were to get authority from their Parliament for the payment of the monies concerned, was entirely their business, not ours. I understood that in fact the monies involved had been voted by the Dail year by year for many years.Mr. de Valera said that the item had been hidden in the Estimates. We in the United Kingdom had more experience of democratic Government, and knew more about proper democratic procedure, than any other people. We ought to have realised at the time that the proper method was not being followed in the Irish Free State, and taken steps to see that the Financial Agreements were given proper authority by the Dail.I answered that if the monies appeared in the Estimates at all, presumably any Member of the Dail could have asked questions about them, and could have challenged the votes. But I did not propose to enter into argument on that. It surely would have been quite improper for United Kingdom Ministers to take the line which Mr. de Valera had just suggested. The Irish Free State was a Dominion; its Government was the Government of a.sovereign nation; it was free to order its own Parliamentary affairs in its own way. Any interference by the United Kingdom Government in the domestic affairs of a Dominion Government and Parliament would be quite improper. It was open for Mr. de Valera to say that Mr. Cosgrave should have sought the approval of the Dail in some other way; that was a matter between him and Mr. Cosgrave; it was nothing to do with us. What the present Irish Free State Government was doing, in fact, was to punish us for a fault which they alleged to have been committed by the Irish Free State Government which preceded them. So far as we were concerned, we had been entitled to assume that when we concluded Agreements with the accredited representatives of a sovereign country, those Agreements held and would be honourably carried out unless and until they were revised as a result of negotiation.Mr. de Valera admitted that he saw the force of that argument. But he repeated that he was convinced that the payments of Land Annuities by the Irish Free State Government to the United Kingdom Government were wrong. Mr. Cosgrave ought never to have concluded such Agreements. He himself could not consent to pay any of those monies. He had not committed himself to any public statement on the point until he was fully satisfied that this attitude was right. Now he had made those public statements; his policy was settled and fixed, and there could be no modification of it. If we wanted payments on account of Land Annuities, then there was no chance of agreement with him and his Government.  We would have to wait for another Government in Dublin.I said that if that was his attitude, we, on our side, might well decide that it was useless to try to reach agreement with him. We would then continue to get the money by levying tariffs on Irish Free State imports. But so that I might fully understand his point of view, I should like to ask him some questions regarding other financial items.    His Government were withholding other
payments besides Land Annuity payments which were due to us under the Financial Agreements. There were sums on account of Royal Irish. Constabulary pensions, there were certain other pension payments due, and there were payments on account of Local Loans. In addition, I thought there were one or two other smaller items. He had never said anything in public about these. What was his attitude regarding them ?He answered that he had not gone into these items with the same care as he had devoted to the question of the Land Annuities. He would have to do so. It might well be that he would feel there was greater justification, for these payments being made, or at any rate for some of them. He could not answer the question definitely now.   Certainly, the question regarding them was open.I asked whether I could therefore feel fully assured that his statements regarding paying no penny of the Land Annuities applied only to the Land Annuities item, and that he had never in any way intended that those statements should cover other payments which he had been withholding. Fie said that that was so. He had never intended that his unequivocal statements should cover other items, regarding which he had not fully informed himself. Of course, it might be that when he had made those speeches regarding the Land Annuities the people of the Irish Free State had understood his remarks to apply to all payments under the Financial Agreements, and that if he now proceeded to make some payments, they would charge him with breach of faith. It might be politically difficult for him to make any payments at all under the Financial Agreements. Moreover, since he was convinced that the Land Annuities payments ought never to have been made, we ought, in his view, to pay back whal had already been handed to us on that account during past years. If what we owed to the Irish Free State on that account were balanced against what the Irish Free State might owe us on account of other items, it would be found that the credit balance was on the side of the Free State.I thought it expedient not to pursue this dangerous line of thought, lest Mr. de Valera committed himself irrevocably to the idea expressed in it. I repeated that, as I understood it, the question of payments on account of the Royal Irish Constabulary Pensions, Local Loans, and some other items was completely open; it was possible that his Government would be prepared to resume payments on those accounts.He agreed that that was the position at present; he would look further into the question of these other items.I said that as I understood his position he would not recognise as valid the Financial Agreements which we had made with Mr. Cosgrave. But he would be prepared to start with a clean slate and to make a new Financial Agreement with us. It was possible that as part of that Agreement he would be ready to make payment of R.I.C. pensions, Local Loans, &amp;c, but it was impossible for him to agree to make payments on account of Land Annuities. I observed that an Agreement so composed would mean that we gave up by far the greater part of the monies to which we were entitled. I did not see how we could seriously contemplate that. In our view such an arrangement would be unjust and impossible on the merits of the case. But apart from that, we had political difficulties just as he himself had. Our public opinion would never consent to such a one-sided arrangement. He often spoke of his political difficulties; I hoped that, as a realist, he would recognise ours. I could well understand that as a result of the public statements which he had made, it would be extremely difficult for him to make any payments on account of Land Annuities. Yet I wondered whether in certain circumstances he could not agree to make at least some Land Annuities payments. For instance, some of the holders of Land Stock were citizens of the Irish Free State. Would he be willing to make at least the pay-ments which were required in order that citizens in his own country might receive their due ?He replied emphatically that any payments on account of Land Annuities were out of the question.I answered that if we were to get anything like a balanced financial agree-ment, we must see then whether there were other items which could be brought into it as substitutes for Land Annuities. A new financial agreement might be drawn up in which we agreed to waive our right to Irish Free State payments on Land Annuities, but in which the Irish Free State Government, for its part, -agreed to make certain other payments, in addition to payments on account of
R.I.C. pensions, Local Loans, and other items in the existing agreements. For example, we were paying war pensions to ex-soldiers who were citizens of the Irish Free State. If the possibility of the Irish Free State Government taking-over responsibility for some such additional payments as that were not excluded, we might begin to find a basis on which negotiations could be started.Mr. de Valera said that in his view the practical way out of the difficulty was to substitute increased defence expenditure by the Irish Free State Govern-ment for the payments which had been made under the old Financial Agreements. At present we were in occupation of the Treaty Ports in the Irish Free State; we were involved in certain expenditure necessary to equip them and the Southern Irish coast generally with appropriate defence. He would like an agreement by which the Irish Free State Government took over responsibility for that expenditure. He was perfectly ready to spend whatever might be necessary, within the limits of what the Irish Free State could afford, to bring the Ports and the whole coast of the Irish Free State into an efficient state of defence. That expenditure would be considerable. It would be severely criticised by many in the Irish Free State. Some of his fellow-countrymen argued that the Irish Free State by itself required little defence; that if it were an island in the middle of some distant ocean, no-one would have designs against it, and that it was only because Ireland was so close a neighbour of Great Britain that it was liable to attack by an enemy of Britain who wished to secure a convenient base of attack on Britain. Therefore, those people would say, Great Britain ought to find what-ever money was necessary to defend the coast of Ireland. He (Mr. de Valera) did not agree with that argument. The Irish Free State must be responsible and pay for her own defence. The Irish Free State was a free country and he was determined to defend that freedom. Ireland&apos;s freedom was bound up with the freedom of Great Britain; if the latter were threatened the former was also threatened and no responsible person in the Irish Free State could escape that fact. It was in the interests of the Irish Free State herself that Great Britain should be as secure as possible from attack by any enemy, and especially from attack by an enemy using the Irish Free State as a, base. He himself had given public assurances that he would never allow the Irish Free State to be so used. He wanted to implement those assurances by putting his country&apos;s defences into an efficient state. He was ready to relieve Great Britain of that responsibility and that expenditure. He would so equip his country that Great Britain, would be completely secure on that flank. His own view was, therefore, that the best settlement of the financial dispute was that we should accept the position that the Free State Government could make none of the payments included in the existing Financial Agreements, and that instead she should spend large sums on her (and incidentally our) defence.I said that there were certain other aspects of the defence question which I should like to refer to later, but as regards the financial aspect, the difficulty of his proposal was that the expenditure which he would incur on defence was a very small amount in comparison with what he should pay us under the Financial Agreements. The capital value of the latter payments was in the region of  100,000,000. The capital value of the Land Annuity payments alone had been computed at something like  78,000,000. I had not gone carefully into the expenditure which would be necessary to bring the ports and coasts of the Irish Free State into a state of efficiency, but I understood that the capital cost would not amount to more than a few  100,000&apos;s. It was true that the maintenance cost should also be considered, but the whole expenditure, capital plus maintenance, was a tiny fraction of the sums which were due to us under the Agreements which we had reached with the late Irish Free State Government. Therefore, unless various other items could be added, I did not see that any basis for negotiation existed.Mr. de Valera replied that he, too, had not gone in the matter of the possible defence expenditure in detail. It might be that I had stated correctly the sort of sum which would be required by way of capital expenditure. His desire would be to do everything possible to make and keep the Irish Free State defences completely up-to-date. There would have to be considerable new equipment in the ports; he thought that in addition he would probably have to buy some small ships; he would wish to acquire also a number of aeroplanes; and he would like to increase considerably the size of the Irish Free State army. All this expansion would mean a great increase in the cost of maintenance of, the defence forces of
the Irish Free State; the increase should be of great value to Great Britain from the point of view of her security, and a certain amount of it would be an actual saving of expenditure to the United Kingdom Treasury. In working out his plans he would wish to maintain close contact with us. He would like the advice of our experts in deciding on his defence programme. Co-operation was essential. For instance, if he were to order military aeroplanes, he would wish to order types like our own, and the same applied to war material generally. The plans should be worked out so that the Irish Free State and the United Kingdom forces could co-operate. Of course, if the United Kingdom became involved in war there would be those in Ireland who would say &quot; Britain&apos;s difficulty is Ireland&apos;s opportunity.&quot; But he did not hold that view at all; he would guarantee that in any case the Irish Free State would not be used to embarrass us in war. The wish of his country-men in any war would be to remain neutral, and this would be the case even if the United Kingdom were involved in war. But he thought it very likely that the Irish Free State would be drawn in on our side. It was difficult to foresee the circumstances in which we might be involved in war. But if there were an act of aggression against Great Britain, the Irish Free State would be in with us. Or if there were a war under the Covenant of the League of Nations such as there might have been over Abyssinia the Irish Free State would be in with us. There was no question of the Irish Free State having to use her military forces except in co-operation with ours. The only limit to the expenditure which he would be willing to incur on bringing his forces into a state of adequate efficiency was the limit of what his country could afford.Mr. de Valera never directly answered my question whether there was a possibility of his Government agreeing to- make some new payment (such as a payment on account of Irish Free State ex-servicemen&apos;s pensions) in addition to R.I.C. pension payments, &amp;c, in substitution for the Land Annuities, and I did not press him. I thought it discreet for the time being simply to leave the idea in his mind.The Treaty Ports.I said that the question of defence raised other matters. I wondered whether in any case agreement between us on general defence questions was possible. At present United Kingdom forces were in occupation of the three Treaty Ports. As he knew, we had made an offer regarding this situation which we would be willing to implement as a part of a general settlement of outstanding questions with the Irish Free State. Speaking in general terms, we were ready to cease our occupation of the ports, and to enter into an arrangement by which there was complete co-operation between the two Governments on all defence matters, on condition that we received an assurance that the ports would be available for our use in time of war.He replied that he could give us no such assurance. It was politically impossible for him to do so. He repeated that there were those in Ireland who argued that Ireland required no defence equipment for her own sake, but only to secure her against one of Great Britain&apos;s enemies who attempted to attack Great Britain through Ireland. Therefore, these critics said, the defence require-ments of Ireland were really requirements for the defence of Britain. He himself did not agree with that line of argument, but it would be levelled against the increased expenditure which he wished to provide for defence, and would become extremely dangerous if he appeared to provide evidence of its truth by giving an assurance now that in any war in which we were involved in future, whatever the circumstances, we would have the use of Irish Free State ports for our military purposes, He would, in fact, be defeated; his defence programme would be overthrown, and a party opposed altogether to the connection with Great Britain would come into power in the Irish Free State, with the result that the position of the United Kingdom in case of war would be much less secure. He therefore hoped greatly that we would be ready to give up our occupation of the ports without the assurance we had asked for. He was afraid there was a serious danger of war; he had made practically no provision for the Irish Free State defending herself or playing any military part in the war; he was anxious to do that, but while we were in the ports it was practically impossible for him to do so because of the damaging arguments which his critics could level against him.
He would ask us to consider carefully two important factors. First, our own actual military security. If we stayed in the ports, our occupation of them would remain a point of serious friction between the people of the Irish Free State and the people of Britain. The Irish regarded our occupation as an infringement of their national sovereignty. If in those circumstances we were to&apos; become engaged in war, he was afraid that feeling in Ireland would be so strong that there would be land attacks on the ports by irresponsible but considerable Irish forces. We would, of course, have to defend them against those attacks. Military action between our forces and Irish forces on Irish soil would arouse further the hostility of the Irish people. Any possibility of their coming into the war on our side would be at least gravely prejudiced. We might find that we were involved in the reconquesft of Ireland. On the other hand, if we did not remain in the ports, that extremely unpleasant possibility would not arise. A sore point with the Irish would have been removed. The result would be a tendency to much better feeling on the part of the Irish towards Britain. There was much more likelihood then that if war came the Irish would come in on our side, and much more likelihood of our being invited to use the ports in the common defence of our two countries.Secondly, he said, there was the question of relations between Britain and the United States of America. Looking at the general world situation, he thought that friendship between Great Britain and the United States became steadily more and more important to Great Britain herself and to the world generally. One of the main causes of a certain distrust of us which was still felt in the United States was the presence there of an immense Irish population who were hostile to Great Britain. If we could settle the points in dispute between the Irish Free State and Great Britain, it would make an immense difference to feeling in America, which would be much, more friendly. Real, unqualified friendship with the United States would be vastly more valuable to us than the satisfaction of a claim for a sum of money, or than our occupation of three Irish ports against the will of almost the whole Southern Irish population. Fie often tried to put himself in our shoes, to try to understand our feelings regarding this dispute between our countries, and he sometimes wondered whether we were seeing things in their proper perspective even from our own point of view, and whether we were not attaching far too little importance to the larger considerations.I replied that we certainly did not fail to take those considerations into account. We recognised their great importance. But the problem was not quite so simple as he had made out. He had spoken of the value to Great Britain of good relations with the United States of America. The maintenance of such relations was one of the guiding principles of our foreign policy, and we would gladly do anything that we reasonably could to that end. But there were some prices that we could not pay even to secure American friendship. We could not surrender for it our island security. He was mistaken if he supposed that we wanted to use the Irish Free State ports to attack anyone. We wanted them purely for defence purposes. Nor was it only the defence of the shores of the Irish Free State that we were concerned about; it was also the defence of something more vital to us than that, our food supplies coming across the Atlantic. In the last war the use of these ports had been a matter of life and death to us. The Navy had operated from them to protect our merchant ships on the Atlantic.Mr. de Valera wondered whether, if that was our sole purpose, we could not use Irish Free State ports in any case, without any prior assurance from him.. Even supposing that the Irish Free State were neutral in a war, was there not some international understanding by which ships of belligerents could use neutral ports for that kind of work ?I answered that I was not an expert on these matters, but that I thought he-was wrong. Convoy work involved large numbers of Naval vessels; it was an. important activity in modern warfare; it even lay at the heart of the struggle. I did not think that a neutral country could allow a belligerent to use its ports for a purpose so important in the general campaign. There certainly were circum-stances in which the warships of a belligerent could put into a neutral port, but I thought it was only if the ships were in some kind of distress and on condition that they only stayed for a limited time.
Mr. de Valera asked why we. wanted the ports for convoy work. Could not our ships assemble in extra-territorial waters off the Irish coast \I replied that the ships would require convenient bases to operate from, they wanted ports for fuelling, for small repairs, and also as a centre from which the whole business of convoy could be Organised. No doubt registration and other similar records had to be kept.Mr. de Valera asked whether all these activities could not be carried on equally well from our own ports, such as Plymouth. I repeated that I was not an expert in the matter, but that it seemed to me as a layman that Plymouth was not nearly so conveniently situated for the protection of merchant ships crossing the Atlantic. It was a few hours&apos; steaming further away, and these few hours might make all the difference. In this matter we were not dealing with one of the minor activities in a war in which we were engaged; it was a major activity. The enemy would try to starve out our island; we should require all available resources and facilities to defend ourselves against the enemy&apos;s supreme effort. If the United Kingdom were starved out, then we lost the war and our freedom would go. He himself had said that if-we lost our freedom, the Irish Free State would be the next to lose theirs. So they were involved. It was a matter of vital importance to them as well as to us that our population should be secure in the matter of food supplies. The fact was that our two islands were thrown together; their respective securities were bound up together.  Why not face the fact ?Mr. de Valera replied that in the Irish Free State they would no doubt have to consider those points if a war actually came, but that for the reasons which he had already given it was really politically impossible for him to make an agreement containing the assurance that we had asked for. He repeated that he could assure us that his country would not be used as a base of attack on us, and added that if the Irish Free State forces seemed inadequate to secure this, they would without hesitation invite our assistance. If the Free State were engaged in a war in which we were also engaged, there would, of course, be no difficulty about our getting the use of the ports when the time arrived.  But he could give no prior assurance.I said that we could not admit that one member of the Commonwealth had a right to remain neutral if the others were at war. But apart from that considera-tion, from the practical point of view, if he was really adamant that he could not give us the assurance we required, then we might well decide that we could not negotiate any new defence agreement with him. We might have to decide that we would remain in occupation of the ports; we had a right to do so under the Treaty and we should simply maintain our right under the Treaty.He observed that there were a good many of our so-called rights that he challenged. Talking to most people he would speak a great deal about that, but he did not think it necessary to keep on referring to his attitude on these matters when speaking to me. He thought I understood that background to our discussions, and he was anxious to consider the details of what might be a practical agreement between us.1 assured him that we all understood his general position, and that we too were anxious for practical agreements. But if we could not get a new practical agreement which secured sufficiently our vital interests, then we would have ho alternative but to maintain the present practical agreement by which we found ourselves in the position of occupying Irish Free State ports. If our military advisers said that the use of these ports in war was essential to our existence, we could take no risks. It would be criminal for a Government to surrender a point which was of the greatest possible importance to its people.He said that he wondered whether the use of these ports1 was really vital to us. Military advisers were notoriously conservative and limited in outlook. Even if it were true that the use of the ports had been vital in the last war, that was no criterion. The next war would be totally different. Military advisers were always thinking in terms of the last war.I answered that the military advisers would, of course, not settle the point. The Cabinet would have to decide; it would be a political decision. But Ministers would naturally first seek the advice of their military and naval experts on the military and naval aspects of the matter. I did hot recognise our military advisers from his description; we had complete faith in these advisers, otherwise they would not be our advisers. We Ministers could not pretend that we knew so much about the special military and strategic aspects of the question as they did, and on these aspects their opinion must naturally carry very great weight.[15940] c
If other considerations entered in, that was another matter.   In any case, the decision was one that would be made by the Cabinet.He said that he was really apprehensive as to the position. There might be a war and in that case our occupation of the ports would be a very awkward factor for the Government of the Irish Free State and for the Government of the United Kingdom. He hoped that we would attach due weight to what was the real issue. We had to choose between, on the one hand, continuing our occupation of the ports, incurring the further ill-will of the Irish, risking an Irish rebellion against our occupation if we became engaged in war, and so prejudicing the whole chance of the Irish nation coming in on our side; and on the other hand, abandoning the occupation of the ports, gaining the greater goodwill of the Irish, ushering in a period of co-operation in matters of defence, and securing at least the benevolent neutrality of the Irish and perhaps their positive military assistance in case of war. He really did want co-operation with us. For example, he would require a lot of war materials. They could not produce those things themselves and must order them elsewhere. Rather than get them from some foreign power, he would like to get them all from us.Trade.I said that any wider trade agreement than the pact which existed between, us to-day must depend on a settlement of the financial dispute. Our special tariffs against Irish Free State imports were only imposed so that we could recoup ourselves for the monies due to us under the Financial Agreements which were being withheld by his Government. If we could not get a satisfactory settlement of the dispute, then we would have to continue the tariffs. But if we could get a settlement we would be ready at once to negotiate a trade agreement with the Irish Free State on the lines of our Ottawa Agreements with the other Dominions.Mr. de Valera said that his Government were pursuing a policy of developing secondary industries in the Irish Free State. They could not negotiate any agreement with us which interfered with that policy. Ireland had been too exclusively agricultural in the past. They were now deliberately making her production more balanced, so that the country would be more self-supporting in manufactured goods.I replied that in our Ottawa Agreements with the other Dominions we had agreed in principle to the development of secondary industries in those Dominions when there was a reasonable prospect of the industries becoming economic. We would of course agree to the same principle in the case of the Irish Free State. Even so, there ought to be plenty of room for additional imports from the United Kingdom.He said that he agreed that that was so. But he did not want to put all his eggs into one basket. He would like to do some trade with other manufac-turing countries as well as with us.I answered that we could not object to that in principle. But, in practice, the less he took from us, the less we would be able to take from him. If on account of his desire to trade with other manufacturing countries he could make only a few concessions to us, then we would not be able to make to him the con-cessions which we might otherwise make. We must have an agreement between the two countries in which the advantages were mutual and balanced.He said that he really agreed with this. Whilst he would like to distribute his trade over a number of countries, he would really wish in practice to give us the lion&apos;s share of imports into Southern Ireland. He thought that in return they could do a great deal for us. We had spoken of the possibilities of war, and of the importance of food supplies to the United Kingdom in such an emergency. He had always sympathised with our efforts to develop our own agriculture so that we became less dependent on imports of food-stuffs from overseas. But there was a limit to our own production of food, and beyond that we would always be vitally dependent on supplies from overseas. In the Irish Free State they could develop a very valuable source of supply to us.I answered that we had valuable sources of supply in the other Dominions also; and that if those other Dominions gave us preferences which the Irish Free State withheld from us or only gave us in part, then we would have to continue giving more consideration to those other friends than we did to the Irish Free State.
Partition.Mr. de Valera said that he attached great importance to the ending of partition between Southern and Northern Ireland. By that he did not mean that Northern Ireland should lose its own Parliament; he envisaged a scheme in which it would continue to look after its own affairs. But partition had done a great deal of wrong to Ireland; the Irish people, who should have been one nation, were divided. It was the wrong of partition that had brought him into public life. During recent years he had seen some of his political aims realised, but his chief objective was to help to bring about a united Ireland. He would like to see that done in his lifetime. Quite apart from his sentiment in favour of a united Irish nation, he thought that the present situation was dangerous from the point of view both of the Irish Free State and the United Kingdom. Just as one of his chief fears about our occupation of the ports was that if we were involved in war there would be an Irish attack on the ports and there would be hostility instead of friendship between our two peoples, so also if partition were still in being when the next war came he was afraid that it would be a powerful element influencing people in Southern Ireland to oppose us. He feared that there would be serious trouble on the border, which would be extremely embarrassing to him and an additional centre of trouble for us.I replied that the continuance or ending of partition was a matter for the people of Northern and Southern Ireland. If the people of Northern Ireland wished to maintain their position as a part of the United Kingdom, we should, of course, support them in that. But if the people of Northern Ireland of their own volition desired to join in any way with the Irish Free State, we would raise no objection.   In that case we would not raise a finger to preserve partition.Mr. de Valera asked what I meant by &quot; not raising a finger to preserve partition.&quot; Supposing there was an attack by people irresponsible people, perhaps from the South on the North, would we raise a finger then?I replied that we certainly would. Any attack by force on the North, from whatever quarter it came whether responsible or irresponsible would be resisted by force. We should send whatever military forces were required to defend Northern Ireland. The Six Counties were a part of the United Kingdom, and we would no more allow Irish Free State forces to attack that piece of the United Kingdom than we would allow any foreign forces to launch an attack on Kent or Sussex. When I spoke of not raising a finger to preserve partition, I referred to circumstances in which the people of the North had changed their present mind and themselves positively wished partition to come to an end.Mr. de Valera said that, of course, there was no intention to attack the North. Some people in the Irish Free State urged that partition should be ended by force. But he always publicly denounced these people and repudiated their policy. However, there could be no complete friendship in the Irish Free State towards Britain so long as partition lasted.I replied that I had discussed the question of the financial dispute and other matters with him because I had hoped it might be possible to find some basis of agreement on those questions. But regarding partition I must say that I thought there was no possibility whatever of any step being taken in the direction he desired. This was a matter primarily for the people of Southern Ireland and Northern Ireland. Nothing could be done against the wishes of the people of the North; there could be no. question of our even trying to persuade them, if they did not want to be persuaded. In any case, I thought that Mr. de Valera had an exaggerated idea of our influence over the people of Northern Ireland on this question. In my contacts with him and others from the Irish Free State I had&apos; found that Southern Irishmen were extremely uncompromising and obstinate in maintaining their views. The people of Northern Ireland shared those qualities in equal degree. I occasionally had contacts with people, official and unofficial, from Northern Ireland, and my impression was that none of them was prepared to entertain for one moment any suggestion of union with the South. If anyone could change that opinion in the course of time, it was not we in the United Kingdom but they in the Irish Free State. If they had shown a willing-ness to respect the things which the people of Northern Ireland care about deeply, there might possibly have been some chance of a gradual change, of opinion in the North. But in Southern Ireland they had been doing the very opposite. His recent Constitutional legislation had been calculated to make even stiffer, if that were possible, Northern hostility against union with the South. [15940] D
Mr. de Valera replied that his information did not support my last eon-tention. He thought that his Constitution had helped. The Constitution had been framed largely with a view to enabling the North to come into a union one day. Many of his own followers had strongly criticised the provisions for the Irish Free State&apos;s association with the Commonwealth and the acceptance of The King, but these had been concessions to Northern opinion. They would be retained; he did not anticipate any further alterations in the Constitution; he hoped, therefore, that the North would be disposed to come in. Already there were large areas in the North where the people were anxious for union; not the whole of the Six Counties wished to remain separated from the Southland it was particularly wrong that those parts should be kept from joining the South. But it was a great wrong that any piece of Ireland should be partitioned off from the rest. Certainly there were many in the North who were strongly opposed to union with the Irish Free State. But --these always had been and were a tiny minority of the population of Ireland. If a minority in any country which dis-iiked the central government were to be allowed to set up an independent government of their own the. situation in Europe and elsewhere would speedily become intolerable. Why had a minority in Ireland got a right which was not recognised anywhere else?I remarked that the. people of the North had not set up a new state of their own. They were a part of the United Kingdom and had been a part of it for many generations.Mr. de Valera replied that they were Irishmen; no nation had more definitely set and easily definable boundaries than the nation inhabiting the small island of Ireland. He asked whether the Government of the United Kingdom were in favour of the principle of a united Ireland ?I replied that it depended on the views of the people of Northern Ireland. If they joined with the people of the South in wishing it, we would not stand in their way. We would then be friendly to the idea of a united Ireland. But if they were opposed to it, we would support them in remaining a part of the United Kingdom. They were a part of us, they were closely united to us, they wished to remain so.   We would not let down our own people.Mr. de Valera asked whether partition was a deliberate part of the policy of the United Kingdom Government.I replied that partition as such was hot. If the people of the North wished to end partition, we would not exert our influence to maintain it. But I must repeat that the facts of the situation convinced me that there was no possibility whatever of any alteration in the present situation in the near or even the more distant future.He asked whether we would make a public statement to the effect that parti-tion as such was not a part of our deliberate policy. I replied that I could not possibly answer that question without adequate time to consider it, and without consulting the Prime Minister and my colleagues. But I was opposed to public statements which might only lead to misunderstanding, or to people jumping to conclusions which were not justified. Any statement of the kind would have to be coupled with all the qualifications which I had expressed in this confidential talk with him. I doubted whether such a statement would add anything to what was already public knowledge.  Mr. de Valera agreed that it would not be much use.He said that he was very sorry if nothing could be done regarding partition for some time, but he must accept the fact. They in the Irish Free State would continue to protest publicly against partition, and would carry on their pro-paganda for bringing it to an end. He hoped that we could make some progress in the other matters which we had just been discussing.I replied that I would report our conversation to my colleagues. We in London might decide that in view of what he had said on those other matters it was no good trying to make&apos; progress even on them. On the other hand, we might reach the conclusion that we should make some proposals to him in another effort to settle one or two of the questions outstanding between us. But in view of one thing which he had just said, I wondered whether there would be any advantage in attempting to settle those other matters. He had said that there would be no complete friendship between the Irish Free State and Great Britain so long as partition lasted. There was, in fact, no prospect of partition coming to an end. Then would there be any improvement in the sentiment of the Southern Irish towards Great Britain, even if we could settle any or all of the other matters ?
He replied that undoubtedly there would be a feeling of greater friendship than existed to-day, if those other disputes could be settled. He very much hoped that we could make progress with them. He was particularly apprehensive at the situation which might arise if our occupation of the ports continued indefinitely; indeed, this was really an urgent matter, because he would like to get ahead with a considerable expansion of his defence programme, and our occupation of the ports was an obstacle to this. But he had never tried to hide from me, and would not hide from me now, that although Irish goodwill towards Great Britain would be increased by the settlement of these other points of dispute, it would not be whole-hearted until partition came to an end. He himself wanted Irish friendship towards Great Britain to be whole-hearted. There was no doubt that our two peoples ought to be friends; we had been thrown together geographically, and we had many traditions, interests and beliefs in common.I said that I could understand why Irishmen who kept considering the past felt some enmity towards Britain, but that I really wondered what substantial reason there was for that enmity to-day. The Irish Free State was a free country; there was no interference in its affairs by Britain. Moreover, not only were many of the material interests of our two countries common; there was another element in our relationship Avhich ought positively to bind us together in a cordial friendship. Our two countries were members of a Commonwealth of free nations. In every corner of the Commonwealth freedom flourished; its members collectively were the most powerful champions of the idea of freedom in a world where freedom had many enemies; these free nations were conducting an important experiment in peaceful &apos;&apos; international&apos;&apos; co-operation. The Dominions and Great Britain were demonstrating that it was possible for sovereign peoples, by mutual respect, consideration and co-operation to live together in peace. The Irish had played a great part in creating this Commonwealth which was of such value in the world. Our two islands, such close neighbours to each other, were the Mother Countries which had peopled the Commonwealth. Throughout the overseas Dominions Irishmen lived side by side with Englishmen, Welshmen and Scotsmen. The Governments of our two countries had good reason to forget old differences, and to co-operate in a most friendly and hearty spirit in making this great experiment a success.Mr. de Valera replied that he liked this conception. He was strongly in favour of Ireland continuing its association with Britain and the Commonwealth, partly because Irishmen lived in every part of the Commonwealth. There was a time when he was in favour of Ireland breaking her connection with the Empire. But that time had gone by. Later, he had been in favour of the Irish declaring a republic, and so breaking with the Empire, but afterwards coming back into association with it. He had thought that process necessary in order to establish Ireiand&apos;s independence. But subsequently certain things had happened. The Declaration of the Imperial Conference of 1926 and the Statute of Westminster had brought changes into the situation. He no longer thought it necessary for Ireland to break away from the Commonwealth in order to establish her freedom. Her freedom was already established. Therefore, it was not necessary to go through the particular process which he had previously envisaged. He was content with his Constitutional Acts, which maintained without a break the Irish Free State&apos;s association with the Commonwealth. The Irish Free State being free, the only question was what use they should make of their freedom. There were those in Ireland who thought that they should use it to set up a republic and be completely independent of the Commonwealth. He did not agree with them. He was content to stay in the Commonwealth on the present terms. He did not anticipate that there would be any further Constitutional changes in Southern Ireland. Of course, a new situation might arise which made some change inevitable. Perhaps if partition continued indefinitely, and there seemed no prospects of a united Ireland being achieved under the present Constitutional arrangement, people might say that there was no further point in remaining associated with the Commonwealth, and then they might declare a republic. He did hope that we would be able to settle the outstanding points between our two countries, so that the way might be cleared for the real friendship which he and I desired.M. M.
