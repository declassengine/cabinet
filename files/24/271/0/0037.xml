THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1937. SECRET. Copy No.CP. 237 (37).CABINET.Mr. de VALERA AND PALESTINE.Note by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.IN the course of my talk with Mr. de Valera at the Grosvenor Hotel on the 4th October, he remarked that some interesting matters had come up for discussion at Geneva after my departure. For instance, there had been the Palestine question and the question of the Far East. With regard to Palestine, he had been surprised when Mr. Elliot in the Sixth Committee had stated very definitely that the United Kingdom Government accepted partition as the solution of the problem and sought the authority of the Committee to proceed with that solution. He (Mr. de Valera) had not understood that we were so definitely committed; he thought that we were leaving the door open for other possible solutions. If Mr. Elliot had merely sought authority to consider the relative merits of various solutions, including partition; he would not have spoken in the Committee or opposed that line of procedure: But he found that the Committee was being asked to commit themselves definitely to partition, and therefore he had felt it necessary to speak against the proposal! He felt sure that partition would prove to be no solution, but would create new troubles for us.I said that we in London had-been extremely sorry to read his speech. In the first place I would say, if I might, that I disagreed with some of the things which he said in it. For example, he had said something to the effect that the represents tives of the Arabs, the Jews and the Christian communities were all opposed to partition. I did not think that was a true statement of the situation.Mr. de Valera replied that he had not seen any public statements to the contrary by representatives of any of these parties. All the evidence which had come to him bore out the truth of his contention.I answered that it was of course impossible at the moment for any leading Jews or Arabs to make a public declaration in favour of partition. But many of the Jewish leaders, including Dr. Weizmann himself and the leaders of the powerful Jewish Labour Party in Palestine, were, in favour of the principle of partition. They wanted alterations in the details of the proposal which had been suggested by the Royal Commission, but they were inclined to be strongly in favour of partition as the solution. They had not felt it expedient to go so far as saying this in speeches at their Congress, but they had succeeded in carrying a resolution giving their Executive Committee power to negotiate, and it was in fact their intention to negotiate on the basis of partition. In addition, I thought that many of the leading representatives of the Christian communities would welcome the proposal that the Mandatory Power should continue to control the areas in which were the Holy Places.Mr. de Valera said that this was all news to him. Naturally he did not know the private views of the Jewish leaders. He could only judge by their public statements, and he had interpreted the proceedings of the Zionist Congress as meaning that the great majority of those there were opposed to partition. In any. case, he felt that partition was a mistake, and that it would fail. [15980]
I replied that we could understand that point of view and recognised his sincerity in holding it; but we were surprised that he should launch a strong attack in public on our policy in Palestine without having given us some prior indication that he was going to do so. We had regretted it all the more seeing that three or four days before he spoke on the Committee he had had two long talks with me and one long talk with Mr. Eden and Lord Cranborne as well as myselfi when we were discussing all sorts of matters of common interest. I thought that he should have let us know his views and given us an opportunity of discussing the whole matter with him, without prejudice to his right to say whatever he wished to say in Committee afterwards.He replied that he would always wish to follow that procedure when he felt compelled to criticise our policy. He would wish to work in consultation with us; he had kept in touch with our delegation at Geneva on the Far Eastern situation. But the proposal about Palestine had taken him by complete surprise in the Committee. He knew the item was on the Agenda, but had not intended to make any speech. He had anticipated that Mr. Elliot would ask for general authority to seek a satisfactory solution, and had not expected that he would ask the Committee to commit themselves to partition. When he heard that, he felt bound at once to express his dissent. If he had remained silent he would have been partly responsible for a policy with which he profoundly disagreed.I said that I did not think that Mr. Elliofs speech should have taken him by surprise. It was not the first occasion on which a spokesman of the United Kingdom Government had made a declaration in favour of partition in Palestine. As soon as the Royal Commission^ Report had been published in July we had also published a White Paper in which we accepted partition as the solution. Afterwards Mr. Ormsby Gore had repeated in a speech in the House of Commons that this was our policy, and Parliament had authorised him to tell the Permanent Mandates Commission that this was the policy which we favoured, whilst not completely closing the door to further solutions if there was any other on which all the parties, including the Jews and the Arabs, could agree. Subsequently the1 Permanent Mandates Commission had made a report to the League Council generally favouring partition, and at the Council Mr. Eden had made a further public statement on behalf of the Government indicating that we would go ahead with the policy of partition. So Mr. Elliofs statement was in substance a repetition of all these earlier pronouncements.Mr. de Valera answered that he must say frankly that he had somehow missed these earlier statements. He knew that the Royal Commission had reported in favour of partition, but had been under the impression that we had not committed ourselves definitely to it. He thought that the way was still open for other solutions, and would have been content to accept that position.I said that we were not irrevocably bound in all circumstances to partition. If the Jews and the Arabs agreed together on some other solution, we would, of course, consider that. But, in practice, the chance of such an agreement was non-existent, so, in effect, partition was the onry possible policy. No doubt it could be criticised, but what was the alternative ? It was the only policy which held out any hope of,an improvement of the situation in Palestine. His speech opposing it had caused a great deal of ill-feeling in the United Kingdom. People had at once said that he was pursuing the policy of &apos;&apos; England&apos;s difficulty is Ireland&apos;s opportunity.&quot; I could appreciate that he felt strongly opposed to partition, but I thought that his speech, coming at a moment when we were making a real effort to see whether we could settle some of the disputes between our two countries, had been extremely unfortunate.He replied that he did not act at all in the spirit of England&apos;s difficulty is Ireland&apos;s opportunity.&quot; He was opposed to that policy. If he had known that the Palestine question was coming Up in the way that it did, he would certainly have let us know first that he intended to oppose partition, and would gladly have had a talk with us.   He would always try to work with us in that spirit.I said that I was glad to have that assurance, which I would pass on to my colleagues. I felt sure that they would appreciate the circumstances in which he had made his speech in the Committee. If he held strong views about our policy in Palestine or on any other matter which might be of common concern between us, we should always be glad to. hear those views and to discuss them with him. We should like to maintain friendly consultation and co-operation with him in international affairs.
He replied that he was anxious for that also. In his own mind he divided international questions into those which were the concern of the United Kingdom alone, and those which were of concern also to the other members of our Common-wealth of Nations. Normally, he would not wish to express any views on the first group of subjects, but he would like to keep in touch with us about the second group. He had regarded Palestine as falling within the first group, except when it came to the point of the League of Nations having to give authority for some change of policy. .   vM.
