THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1937.SECRET.Copy No.   5J.CP. 251 (37).CABINET.COMMITTEE ON TRADE AND AGRICULTURE.Report on the Discussions with the United States for a trade agreement.WE attach, as an Annex to this Report, a Memorandum circulated recently to us by the President of the Board of Trade on the present position of the discussions at Washington for a Trade Agreement between the United Kingdom and the United States of America.2. A deadlock appears imminent and time is short if the opportunity for negotiations is not to pass. The difficulty has arisen from the insistence of the United States that before formal negotiations are opened they should receive assurances that any trade agreement which may be concluded shall provide for the reduction of certain United Kingdom duties. Most of the duties in question are guaranteed under the Ottawa Agreements. A list of them is given in Appendix B to the Annex. The Empire Governments concerned were informed at the time of the Imperial Conference of these &quot; essential &quot; requirements. Their attitude in regard to the loss of their advantages in the United Kingdom market which acceptance of the United States &apos;&apos; essential&apos;&apos; requirements would involve, is summarised in Appendix A to the Annex.3. As will be seen from the concluding paragraphs of his Memorandum, the President of the Board of Trade is convinced that, in the absence of unexpected developments in the near future, further progress in the negotiations with the United States will be impossible unless we are prepared to make a more specific and more substantial offer in regard to the American &apos;&apos; essential&apos;&apos; items than we have hitherto made. Details of what we have already offered will be found in Column 4 of Appendix B to the annexed Memorandum, and the Presidents pro-posals for an improved offer are set out in Column 5 of that Appendix. This improved offer, which would be contingent on the subsequent concurrence of the Empire Governments concerned, would, in any case, only cover a part of what the United States regard as essential, and it is by no means certain that the United States will regard this new offer as an adequate basis for formal negotiations. In the view of the President of the Board of Trade by making it we should have given proof of our determination to make every possible effort on our part to meet the United States, and, if the United States agreed that the offer provided a basis for negotiations, we should then be able to inform the Dominions that we had reached provisional agreement as to a basis of negotiation, and that the with-. holding of their assent would make further progress impossible.4. Since the Memorandum in question was circulated to us the position has to some extent changed. For example, the difficulties in the way of discussions between Canada and the United States have been overcome, and representatives of the two countries are now conferring at Washington. It seems, however, most improbable that any solution of the difficulties will emerge from these U.S.A.-Canada discussions, and we agree with the President of the Board of Trade that our future policy should now be settled on this assumption, and that if the present.deadlock is to be removed some positive step by the United Kingdom Government will be required.  We do not, however, recommend that an improved[16045]b
offer should be made to the United States until after the present discussions between the Representatives of Canada and the United States at Washington have terminated. The making of such an offer while the discussions were still in progress might lay us open to a charge of breach of faith by Canada.5. Paragraph 8 of the. annexed Memorandum contains a quotation from a telegram from our High Commissioner in Ottawa to the effect that Mr. Mackenzie King is not enthusiastic about close relations between the United Kingdom and the United States, particularly if they would involve him in political difficulties. In a later telegram, dated the 15th October, however, Sir Francis Floud intimates that &quot; Mr. Mackenzie King now appears to have a greater recognition of the importance of assisting an agreement between the United Kingdom and the United States as a contribution to world peace, and will emphasise this when he meets Hull here.&quot; -;6. We wish to stress the urgency of finding some solution of the impasse. For the reasons given in paragraph 9 of the annexed Memorandum, the,time factor is of great importance, and if the opportunity of a Trade Agreement with the United States is not to be missed, the opening of formal negotiations with the United States should not be postponed beyond next month. Whatever may be the outcome of the present U.S.A.-Canadian discussions at Washington, it is in any case necessary that we should make up our minds how far we are prepared to go in meeting those of the United States &quot; essential &quot; requirements which affect the home producer.7. It should be noted that the Dominions are concerned in most of the items mentioned in Appendix B to the Annex. We agree with the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs that an improved offer should not be made to the United States without the Empire Governments concerned being informed of its terms.8. In addition to the &quot; essential &quot; items in Appendix B of the Annex, the United States have formulated a list of commodities in the industrial sphere in respect of which they will seek to obtain tariff concessions. While the United States have not insisted on prior agreement being reached in regard to any one of these industrial items before the opening of formal negotiations, we understand from the President of the Board of Trade that it will be impossible to make a comprehensive Trade Agreement with the United States on the basis only of our improved offer on the items in Appendix B of the Annex, and that if such an agreement is to be secured, it will be necessary, in addition, for us to make concessions on commodities in the industrial sphere.9. Subject as mentioned below, we recommend the Cabinet to approve the concessions mentioned in Column 5 of Appendix B to the Annex, on the under-standing that, if and when an offer embodying them is made to the United States, the following conditions shall be attached to it: (a) that adequate concessions are made by the United States; (&amp;) that the Agreement is in other respects satis-f satisfactory; and (c) that, where necessary, the Empire Governments concerned concur in the proposals. We recommend, however, that in order to avoid any possibility of offending the Australian Government, the passage in Column 5 in the case of items 4, 5 and 7 should be modified so as to substitute in each case for the last sentence of the passage a suggestion that the possibilities should be further explored of an arrangement for some limitation of the area under cultivation on lines acceptable to the Australian Government, and that in Item 15 the figure 3s. should be altered to 3s. 6d.10. Our recommendation in the preceding paragraph is subject to the following reservation by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries. In the Ministers view, the maximum concession on Items 1 and 15 should be as follows : Item 1. Apples, fresh or raw, 3s. Qd. per cwt.Item 15. Apples, tinned or bottled, preserved without sugar, 4s. 6*2. per&apos; cwt.As regards Item 17 Hog Products the Ministers view is that duty-free entry for hams should not be offered until the Cabinet have reached a decision on the question of a levy subsidy for bacon.
11. We also recommend the use as a bargaining counter in the negotiations with the United States of an offer on our part to remove the duty on wheat. The President.of the Board of Trade pointed out to us that the removal of the duty on wheat would be unlikely to satisfy the requirements of the United States unless it were accompanied by a reduction in the duty on flour. The latter question is accordingly being further discussed between the Departments concerned.12.   Our conclusions and recommendations may be summarised as follows : -(1) It is desirable that we should be ready to make a more specific and more substantial offer to the United States. No such offer should, however,, be made pending the conclusion of the present Canadian-US.A. discussions at Washington, and without the Empire Governments-concerned being informed of its terms.(2) If we make such an offer, and if the United States agree that it provides a basis for negotiations, we shall be in a position to point out to the Empire Governments concerned that the withholding of their assent will make further progress impossible.(3) As a basis for the offer referred to at (1) we are prepared to contemplate going as far as the concessions suggested in Column 5 of Appendix B to the Annex hereto, on the understanding that if and when an offer embodying them is made to the United States the following conditions shall be attached to it: (a) that adequate concessions are made by. the United States,(&amp;) that the agreement is in other respects satisfactory, and(c) that, where necessary, the Empire Governments concerned agree.On items 4, 5 and 7 we agree that the wording in Column 5 should be modified on the lines indicated in paragraph 9.On item 15 (apples, tinned or bottled, preserved without sugar) the figure recommended by the Committee is 3s. Qd. per cwt., not 3s., as proposed in Appendix B to the Annex hereto.(4) The recommendation at (3) is subject to a reservation by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, who is unable to accept the view of the majority of the Committee as regards three items in Appendix B. The Minister&apos;s view is that the maximum concession on items 1 and 15 should be as follows : Item   1. Apples, fresh or raw, 3s. Qd. per cwt. Item 15. Apples, tinned or bottled, preserved without sugarr 4s. 6d. per cwt.As regards item 17 Hog Products the Ministers view is that duty-free entry for hams should not be offered until the Cabinet have taken a decision on the question of a levy subsidy for bacon. (5) In addition, we recommend the use as a bargaining counter in the United States negotiations of an offer on our part to remove the duty on wheat. The question of reducing the duty on flour is being further discussed between the Departments concerned.Signed on behalf of the Committee :JOHN SIMON, Chairman.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, October 22, 1937.[16045]
SECRET.ANNEX. &apos;.[T.A.C. (36) 49.]CABINET.Committee on Trade and Agriculture.THE USA. NEGOTIATIONS.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.The position at the close of the Imperial Conference.1. The Committee will remember (T.A.C. (36) 47) that the attitude of Dominion Ministers attending the Imperial Conference towards the United States minimum requirements (which is summarised in Appendix A) was such that it was impossible for the United Kingdom Government to state precisely to what extent those requirements could be met except in one or two cases. On many of the items on the list it appeared that the Dominions would be prepared to agree to at least a part of what the United States were demanding, provided that compensation was forthcoming either from the United States or from the United Kingdom.The United Kingdom Offer to the United States.2. In these circumstances, the Committee agreed that our Embassy at Washington should be instructed (a) to explain the position fully and frankly to the United States authorities; (b) to suggest that it afforded a basis for further discussion, if not for actual negotiations; and (c) to try to induce the United States to compensate the Dominions which for one reason or another found the United Kingdom&apos;s offer of compensation inadequate. This offer had been to consider sympathetically any requests which the Dominions might make for the abatement of preferences enjoyed by United Kingdom goods in their markets where such preferences stood in the way of negotiations between the Dominions and foreign countries. The case of Canada presented special difficulty, and it was suggested that this might best be overcome by simultaneous negotiations between Canada and the United States.The attitude of the United States.3. A comparison between what the United States were asking and what our Embassy was able to offer will be found in columns (3) and (4) of Appendix B. The United States were not prepared to enter into formal negotiations on this basis. They explained, as they had done before, that the requirements which they had put forward as &apos;&apos; essential &apos;&apos; represented the minimum which would enable them to justify the extensive concessions offered to us and the minimum with which they could hope to win the support of the primary producers. As regards compensating the Dominions, they declared that, unless and until they were able to point to the advantages secured in an agreement with the United Kingdom for primary products, it was impossible for them to enter into negotiations with the Dominions, since such negotiations would necessarily involve them in concessions on agricultural commodities.&quot; Compensation &quot; for the Dominions.4. Neither Mr.- Casey nor Mr. Nash, who visited Washington in July, demurred when the United States authorities explained to them that the initiation of negotiations with Australia and New Zealand respectively would have to await the conclusion of an agreement with the United Kingdom. The United States authorities, on their side, realised that the Australian Government could not be expected to commit themselves to any specific concessions until after the general election in Australia had taken place.
The Canadian Position.5. The result of our efforts to obtain compensation for Canada, upon which the United States requirements bear most heavily, was then explained to Mr. Mackenzie King. It was felt that only by direct discussion would the United States and Canadian Governments come to appreciate each other&apos;s difficulties. These difficulties are far more political than economic and arise from the fact that two of the most important items on the United States essential list are lumber and apples, and from the fact that one member of the Canadian Cabinet represents British Columbia and another Nova Scotia. It was accordingly suggested that Mr. Mackenzie King should arrange for a representative of the Canadian Government to discuss the problem with the United States authorities. To this suggestion Mr. Mackenzie King reacted violently. He denied knowledge of the United Kingdom Governments offer, referred to in paragraph 2 above, and protested that he had never received an answer to a letter which he had written in London setting out the Canadian Governments position and asking certain questions, doubtless forgetting that he had himself been present at the meeting with me when this offer was made and the questions were answered. He said that he had already made it clear to the United States Minister at Ottawa that his Government would not survive an hour if they surrendered their apple and lumber preference without adequate compensation, and that in the circumstances he could not justify sending a representative to Washington.The Prime Ministers message to Mr. Mackenzie King.6. Mr. Mackenzie King was mollified by a message from the Prime Minister reviewing the course which the discussions between the United Kingdom and the United States Governments had taken since the end of the Imperial Conference and pointing out that these discussions had reached a crucial phase, at which further progress might prove impossible in the absence of direct contact between the representatives of Canada and the United States at Washington.Contact between Canadian and, United States Governments.7. Considerable difficulty arose in finding a formula for the proposed meeting which would reconcile Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;s desire for immediate compensation with the unwillingness of the United States authorities to commit themselves to negotiations with Canada until an agreement with the United Kingdom had been concluded. However, on the 14th August Mr. Mackenzie King finally accepted an invitation &quot; to arrange for informal and confidential dis-cussions without prior commitment on the part of either country.&quot; No arrange-ments were made for these informal conversations until, at the urgent request of Mr. Cordell Hull, Dr. Skelton, the Head of the Canadian Department of External Affairs, proceeded to Washington on the 27th August. His talks with Mr. Hull and with the officials of the State Department did not go beyond generalities, but they appear to have resulted in a clearer appreciation by each side of the other&apos;s difficulties. It was agreed that there was scope for a useful further trade agree-ment between Canada and. the United States to supplement that which came into force on the 1st January, 1936, and that such a supplementary agreement offered the best means of affording Canada compensation for the advantages which she was being asked to surrender in the United Kingdom market. The meeting made it clear that the main difficulty was one of timing the concessions which both Canada and the United States would have to make. The United States repeated their contention that for political reasons they could not enter into any further negotiations involving concessions on agricultural products until they were actually able to announce the concessions obtained as the result of negotiations with the United Kingdom. A further complication arises from the fact that they appear to be pledged to negotiate with Argentina and Uruguay as soon as such an such an agreement has been concluded. Dr. Skelton urged the impossibility of concessions on apples and lumber unless the Canadian Government, in announcing them, should be able to announce simultaneously advantages which would compensate the apple-growing and lumber-producing districts in Canada.The Present Position.8. Subsequent developments are obscure, but it seems to have been agreed when Dr. Skelton left Washington that the next move towards the resumption
of these informal conversations lay with the State Department. The State Department appear to have been unable to put forward any positive suggestion, but say that they have made it clear to the Canadian Government, through their Minister at Ottawa, that they were prepared to receive a Canadian official or officials for the purpose of further conversations. The Canadian Government, on the other hand, have hitherto made no move and appear to be unable, or perhaps unwilling, to go very far. Indeed, one of the latest telegrams from our High Commissioner at Ottawa (No. 266 of the 5th October) suggests that &apos;&apos; while Mr. Mackenzie King attaches importance to close relations between Canada and the United States, he is not so enthusiastic about similar relations between the United Kingdom and the United States, particularly if they would involve him in political difficulties.&apos;&apos;However, according to a later telegram from Ottawa (No. 275 of the 12th October), it seems likely that Canadian officials will be sent to continue the conversations.Urgency of removing present deadlock.9. Although there is now a good chance that the conversations will be renewed, it seems unlikely that a solution of the impasse can be found, unless some positive step is taken by the United Kingdom Government. Some solution is urgently required, if the opportunity of a trade agreement with the United States is not to be missed. The United States authorities have urged the necessity for the conclusion of an agreement as early as possible next year, i.e., well before the congressional elections in November. Their machinery for the conduct of formal negotiations makes it necessary to allow at least four months from the announce-ment of formal negotiations, and a longer period for their conclusion may well prove to be necessary. &apos;United States requirements affecting the United Kingdom producer.10. It ia improbable that any further appeal to the United States on the present basis would be effective. It is doubtful whether any further appeal to Mr. Mackenzie King would be any more effective unless fresh arguments could be adduced. I suggest, therefore, that unless there are unforeseen developments immediately, we should make a more positive offer than that which we have hitherto put to the United States, but that we should make it contingent on the subsequent concurrence of the Dominions. In order to impress upon both the United States and the Dominions the readiness of the United Kingdom to make sacrifices affecting the home producer, it seems important that in any such offer we should go as far as we possibly can.11. Hitherto we have not, except in regard to a few items on the American essential list, said more than that we should be prepared to offer &quot; some reduction &quot; of the existing duty. We have not even indicated how far the United Kingdom Government would themselves be prepared to go on those items on the list which affect home as well as Dominion interests. Where we have specified or hinted at a figure it falls far short of the American demand. Moreover, there are a number of purely Dominion items on which no concession is possible. Thus, the United States at present see no definite prospect of securing even a substantial part of the minimum which they still regard as essential for political justification of an agreement.Proposed duty reductions.12. The items on the essential list which affect the United Kingdom producer are apples and pears, canned berries, Douglas fir doors and hog products. The existing duty on apples and pears (which is guaranteed under the Ottawa Agree-ments) is 4s. Qd. per cwt. The United States are asking that it should be reduced in the case of apples to 2s. 3d. per cwt. and in the case of pears to 2s. Qd. per cwt. from August to January inclusive, i.e., during the off-season for South African, Australian and New Zealand pears. Hitherto, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries have provisionally agreed that we might offer a reduction of Is. per cwt., but this offer has never been conveyed to the United States as it was not possible to secure the assent of Canada, which is the Dominion mainly concerned, to any specific reduction.
13. I am convinced that we have arrived at the stage when further progress in the negotiations with the United States is impossible unless we make a more specific and a more substantial offer. I therefore ask my colleagues to agree to offer a reduction of Is. 6d. per cwt. on apples and pears and corresponding figures for the other items as set out in Appendix B. Apples are an item to which the United States attach special importance. Moreover, the decision taken in regard to them affects a number of other times, since (a) the offer to be made on pears and canned apples must be related to that on raw apples, (b) we can scarcely ask the Dominions to agree to greater concessions than those which we are ourselves prepared to make. Thus on grapefruit, which is mainly a South African interest and on which the Union Government are prepared at a price to agree to whatever we may think necessary, we could scarcely propose a proportionately greater reduction of duty than that which we ourselves are prepared to offer on apples. I also propose that we should improve our offer to the United States on hog products by agreeing, so far as hams are concerned, to their request for the conventionalisa-tion of entry free of duty. I feel sure that the United States authorities would regard this as a most important concession.The existing duty on doors (20 per cent, ad valorem or 2s. Qd. per door, which-ever is the greater) is not guaranteed by any Ottawa agreement. It was imposed to protect a new British industry against the competition of cheap doors from the U.S.A., but it has also led to the replacement of the U.S.A. by Canada as the principal overseas source of supply. Although a reduction of the duty might cause hardship to the United Kingdom industry, I consider that we should be justified in offering a reduction of the alternative specific duty to Is. Qd. per door.14. As regards the rest of their demands we are unable to offer the United States anything on tobacco beyond conventionalisation of the existing margin of preference. On dried fruits, it is unlikely, owing to political considerations in Australia, that we shall be able to meet them even half-way. On canned fruits we could, for the same reason, offer concessions only on berries, grape-fruit and fruit salad, representing about one-quarter of the total trade on which they are seeking concessions. On timber it seems unlikely that the Canadian Government would agree at the most to more than a small part of the United States demands and further there is the treaty difficulty as to the treatment of competing timber from the Scandinavian and Baltic countries.15. Thus, the very best offer that we could make to the United States would cover only a part of what they regard as essential. On the other hand, however, we have asked them whether they would be prepared to accept the removal of the duty on wheat in substitution for a range of their &quot;essentials.&quot; To this-enquiry we have not yet received a considered reply. Indications are that if our offer on wheat included also a concession on flour, its value would, from their point of view, be greatly enhanced. Should these indications be confirmed I should propose to offer to reduce the duty on flour, from 10 per cent, to 5 per cent. In view of the fact that the U.S.A. are relatively small suppliers of flour I should propose to use this reduction as well as wheat, as a bargaining counter to obtain certain reductions of US. duties for the benefit of the United Kingdom or the Dominions in cases where they are not the principal suppliers.16. If such a composite offer were put forward, we should have given proof of our determination to leave undone nothing which is not absolutely ruled out by our existing commitments. Moreover, if the United States agreed that the offer provided a basis of negotiation, we should then be able to go to the Dominions and say that we had reached provisional agreement as to a basis of negotiation, and that the withholding of their assent would make further progress impossible.O. F. G. S.Board of Trade, October 14, 1937.
APPENDIX A.Position at the end of the Imperial Conference.THE attitude of the Ministers of the various Dominions towards the minimum requirements of the United States, consisting mainly of requests for the abatement of preferences guaranteed under the Ottawa Agreements, was (briefly) as follows :-South Africa was ready, at a price, to agree to whatever reductions in her preferences in the United Kingdom might be necessary to make an agreement with the U.SA. possible. The price ;which the Union Government has since suggested (in the form of modifications of the United Kingdom&apos;s preferences in South Africa) is stiff, but no serious difficulty in reaching agreement is anticipated.Canada could not justify the impairment of advantages obtained under the recent Anglo-Canadian Agreement unless the Government could point to satis-factory compensating advantages. It was thought that the most hopeful means of obtaining such advantages might be simultaneous negotiations between Canada and the USA. or linked Anglo-Canadian-American discussions. The Canadian Government were particularly anxious to know what contribution the United Kingdom would make in the shape of concessions at the expense of the home producer as distinct from the Dominion producer. We had not then received more than the vaguest indication of what the US. would expect.New Zealand, though not greatly affected by the U.S. requirements, also asked for compensation, but was ready to make concessions if it could be shown that a U.K.-U.S.A. agreement would benefit both the United Kingdom and New Zealand.Southern Rhodesia found it impossible for political reasons to agree to any modification of the existing preference on tobacco.India and Burma. In view of the impossibility of offering the U.S. any concession on tobacco, rice was the only commodity on the U.S. list which con-cerned these two countries. It was decided that no definite offer in regard to rice could be made in advance of the arrival of the delegations which were then on their way to negotiate the revision of the U.K.-India Agreement.A australia. In view of the pending general election Commonwealth Ministers felt unable to discuss the matter at all, but the High Commissioner in London gave it as his personal view that in due course Australia might agree to certain concessions, subject to his obtaining compensation. On other requirements put forward by the USA., particularly certain dried and canned fruits, he could hold out little hope.n
