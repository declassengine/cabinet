(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT) SECRET. Copy No,CABINETCP.  216(37)AIR RAID PRECAUTIONS.Allocation of cost &quot;between Exchequer-and Local Authorities.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.1. The importance of dealing px*omptly with the questionof the finance of air raid precautions is so great that I feel it necessary to bring the question again before the Cabinet.2. When the Secretary of State for Scotland and I net the  representatives of the Associations of Local Authorities on the 19th July they refused to discuss the proposal of a 50 per cent, grant and said that the whole cost should be borne by the Exchequer. &apos;3. The proceedings of this confex-ence were considered bythe Cabinet on the 29th July and it was then agreed to postpone a decision on the question of principle until further soundings had been taken as to the attitude of the Local Authorities.4. I have done what I can to ascertain opinions on thisquestion and my conclusions are as followsThex*e are many people who realise that the demand for 100 pei&apos; cent, is untenable,. but these people share the wide-spx*ead view that the financial burden involved by the need of National Defence ought to be box*ne centrally rather than locally and consider, therefore, that the Government grant should cover a vex*y high proportion of the cost.       Unless and until the GoveiTiment announces tei&apos;ms which seem reasonable to these more
2omoderate people they will continue in alliance with the extremists who are demanding 100 per cento     Any attempt at further negotiations is likely to make the position wox*se. So long as there is thought to he a chance of getting improved terms from the Government the moderates and the extremists will stand together and call in unison for 100 per cento      The longer this alliance continues the stronger it is likely to become.       Every week&apos;s delay strengthens this united front.5o In my view the Government ought to make as quickly as possible an announcement which will separate the moderates from the extremists. To secure this object three points are important.(1)    The Government&apos;s decision should be deffinite and final on points of principle,,(2)    The tex-ms of the financial arrangements should be as simple as possible and should not give openings for questions and suspicions as to their consequences and implications,(3)    The terms should be so genei*ous as to make itclear that the Government have realised the strength of the feeling on this subject and have gone as far as is reasonably practicable to meet the view that the burden should fall on the Exchequer rather than the rates,,6. Thex*e have been interdepartmental discussions, as theresult of which it has been suggested that the best plan would be -(a) for the Government to provide and supply fire appliances, so far as they are in excess of peace-time needs, and other equipment for decontamination and rescue pax-ties, first-aid parties, stretchers and blankets:(b) fox* the Government to pay towards the cost of all the othex1 services, a flat grant of so much per cent, no distinction being made between capital and maintenance expenditure or between the vax*ious items of expenditure0
70 So far?    as can be judged from present estimates itappears that the chax*ge on the Exchequer will bo approximately the same whether the Government pays 75 per cent, of all the expenditure, including the expenditure on fire appliances and other equipment, or pays the whole cost of fire appliances and other equipment and 60 per cent, of the rest.      It is no doubt arguable that the Government ought not to be expected to pay more than 75 per cent,, of the overall expenditure and that, therefore, if the Exchequer pays the whole cost of the fire appliances and other equipment a 60 per cent,  grant towards the remaining expenditure is sufficient,,80 If it were not for the special circumstances with whichwe are faced, I should agree that a good case could be made for such a scheme, but I am convinced that an offer of 60 per cent, will not achieve our object.      It will be of no use to ax-gue that the scheme is equivalent to a 75 per cento overall contribution. The general opinion will be that in paying the full cost of fire appliances and other equipment, none of which can be said to have a peace-time value, the Government are doing no more than they ought, and that in paying 60 per cent, of the remaining expenditure they are doing less than they ought.      All the information I have been able to obtain as to opinion amongst Members of Parliament and members of Local Authox-ities shows that nothing less than 75 per cent, will gain suppox*t.90 If 75 pei&apos; cent,  is accepted as the basis of theGovernment grant, the question arises whether the Government should not pay 75 per cent, of all the expenditure, including expenditure on fire appliances and other equipment,      I have considered this altexmative but I feel that such a scheme would seriously weaken the Govex-nment&apos; s answer to the 100 per cent, claim.
The strongest answer to that claim is to point out that the Government are only asking Local Authorities to accept financial responsibility in respect of matters for which they will have substantial administrative responsibility and are relieving them of all charges for material and equipment which can be supplied centrally.10o I therefore urge that the Cabinet should decide both to pay the whole cost of the fire appliances and other equipment and to provide 75 per cent, of the remaining expenditure.      The difference in cost to the Exchequer between a grant of 60 per cent, and 75 per cent,  for the remaining expenditure will be, so far as can be judged from present estimates, approximately a million, of which  600,000 will be capital expenditure and the remainder revenue expenditure over the next two or three years0 By this increase in our financial liability we shall, I believe, decrease enormously the danger of prolonged and widespread opposition.llo I believe that if such a decision were taken and astatement issued on the lines of the draft attached (see Appendix I), we should secure so large a measure of support that we should have little difficulty in meeting such opposition as as may remain and in bringing into operation an enabling Act without compulsory provisions.12o I have not overlooked the consideration that a 75 per cent,grant leaves no margin for additional assistance to the necessitous areas, but this is a minor difficulty compared to the major difficulty with which we shall be confronted if our financial
(24th September, 1937.scheme fails to get the support of that large body of moderate and reasonable opinion which is prepared to recognise that some financial burden must be placed on the rates, provided that burden is reduced to as small a proportion as is consistent with the delegation to the Local Authorities of administrative responsibilitieS 9 He.
APPENDIX draft OF A PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTHis Majesty&apos;s Government have had under consideration the representations made at the conference with the Associations of Local Authorities on the 19th July last about the allocation of the cost of air raid precaution services.At that conference the view was expressed on behalf of the Associations that air raid precautions, while not themselves of a military nature, were intimately and directly related to the whole question of national defence, and it was stated that, while Local Authorities were prepared to co-operate with the Government a agents, they considered that the whole of the cost should he borne by the GovernmentoThe Government appreciates the difficulty felt by Local Authorities in assuming additional financial burdens, hut the steps necessary for taking precautions in the various localities against air raids are of such a character that the placing on Local Authorities of administrative responsibilities is inevitable. Many of the services required are closely interlocked with existing local government services and can only be effectively carried out by means of extensions and developments of existing local machinery. For instance, the repairing of streets damaged by air raids, the control of lights, decontamination work, fire fighting work, etc., are functions clearly appropriate to the Authorities who have ordinary peace time functions connected with street lighting, street repair, the safety of buildings, the organisation of fire brigades, etc.
In the preparation and administration of a programme of air raid precautions throughout the country the relation of the Central Government and the Local Authorities cannot he so simple as that of principal and agentsQ       It must in the nature of things he a partnership in which a due measure of responsibility is taken by the L0cal Authorities for the administration of the local services.While it is the part of the Government to formulate a national policy and to give guidance as to the nature of the precautions required, it is the part of the Local Authorities to prepare and carry out local schemes for giving effect to that policy      In the.- shaping and execution of these local schemes there is a wide field where methods and cost will depend on the initiative, judgment,    care and discretion of those who know the local circumstances and control the local administration.     In the administration of the local air raid services the.Local Authorities will be in the position of responsible administrators whose decisions affect in numerous ways both efficiency and economy.Expenditure on air raid precautions depends both on national policy and local administration..     As already indicated war time requirements and the consequent expenditure may be closely intermingled with peace time requirements, for which it is already the duty of the Local Authorities to make provision.. To place on the Central Government responsibility for the control of the whole of the expenditure, not only so far as such expenditure is dependent on national policy, but also so far as it is dependent on local schemes and local methods of administration, would be open to grave ohjection0     Such a course would mean
depriving the L0eal Authorities of any effective responsibility for the efficiency and economy of their local services, and would involve intervention by the Central Government in the sphere of local government to an extent which would impair the proper independence of Local Authorities in the management of local affairs.      Such a course would be detrimental to efficiency and would, it is believed, be found unacceptable by the Local Authorities themselves.In the view of the Government the administrative powers and responsibilities which must be exercised by the Local Authorities are of so important a character and are liable to affect expenditure to so considerable an extent as necessarily to entail the placing on the Local Authorities of a measure of financial responsibility0Within the limits fixed by this consideration the Government are anxious to do all that is possible to lighten the financial burden to be borne by the Local Authorities.     With this object they have considered how far the cost of certain services could be reduced to the Local Authorities by arranging for materials and equipment to be provided centrally.One of the most burdensome of these services financially is the fire fighting service.      The Government have decided in principle, and subject to the determination of detailed arrangements, to ask Parliament to make the necessary provision to enable the Government to supply to the Local Authorities the whole of the emergency fire fighting appliances and their equipment in so far as they are in excess of requirements for effective protection in peace time.
They will also ask Parliament to make the necessary provision to enable the Government to provide in the same way (a) the equiment needed for decontamination and rescue parties and the equipment and stores for first-aid posts and parties and casualty clearing hospitals in so far as they are not required or normally available for peace time purposes and are not already in the possession of the Local Authorities,  (b) stretchers and blankets, and (c) approved fittings for the obscuration of street lighting.There remain the services for which provision cannot be made centrally and must be made by the Local Authorities on the spot.     Among these are the protection of public buildings, the provision of public refuges and the organisation of local services for decontamination, emergency fire fighting, rescue and repair work and the provision of first aid.     The organisation and administration of these services call for the exercise of initiative and judgment by those who have an intimate knowledge of local circumstances and will be responsible for the local arrangements.For all approved expenditure incurred by Local Authorities -as from 1st January 1937 - for the purpose of air raid precautions the Government have decided to ask Parliament to provide grants which will reimburse the Local Authorities to the extent of per cent, subject to such conditions as maybe necessary to ensure that proper arrangements are being made by them to carry out effectively approved schemes.It may well be that in some cases, e.g. the training of auxiliary firemen, it would be preferable to assess the grant on a capitation basis approximating to per cent, of theestimated average cost, and this question is being further examined.
The effect of these financial proposals is that, over and above the very substantial liability which the Government have already assumed in the setting up of a central organisation, the supply of respirators for the whole of the civil population, the establishment and maintenance of anti-gas training schools, the supply of bleaching powder for decontamination purposes, the provision of respirators and protective clothing for air raid precaution services and the accumulation of reserves of sandbags, the Government are now prepared to pay the &quot;whole cost of the greater part of the material and equipment required for local air raid precaution services;    and that the Local Authorities are being asked to assume a share of the financial responsibility (limited to per cent.) only in those matters where it isnecessary to place on them the administrative responsibility and to rely on their assistance and judgment    to secure economy and efficiency.The Government have decided to introduce legislation at an early date to give effect to these proposals and generally to empower Local Authorities to undertake air raid precaution services.The Secretary of State would be glad to confer with representatives of Associations of Local Authorities as to the heads of the legislation that will be required,  and he would be prepared to discuss with them details of the financial arrangements as set out above.
