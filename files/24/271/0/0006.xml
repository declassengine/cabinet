CONFIDENTIAL. A.C.  386.BOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL.STATE OF TRADE - JULY,  1937,Summary of reports submitted by members of the Board of Trade Advisory Council (supplemented in some cases with statistical information from other sources).OVERSEAS TRADE.Imports in July at  85.5 m. were 16.8 m. more than in July, 1936.      Over 60 per cent of the rise was in food and raw materials;.      Of the increase of  6.4 m. in manufactured goods,  2=8 m. related to non-ferrous metals and manufactures,  822,000 to machinery and over  -g- m. each to oils, fats and resins and iron and steel manufactures.      Exports of United Kingdom products,  47.6 m. were  7.5 m. more and re-exports,  6,8 m. were  1.8 m. more than in July, 1936*EMPLOYMENT.      The total number of unemployed persons on the registers   at 26th July - 1,379,459 - was 22,861 more than at 21st June;    the changes in the various divisions were:-London ..... c. South Eastern, South &quot;\7esternMidlands .....North Eastern.. +1,882 .. -    115.o - 438 4-9,995 -9,682North Western ....... .4-4,909Northern.............-8,099Scotland ............4-30,333Wales............... -5, 924The increase in Scotland was largely due to holiday stoppages *The estimated number of insured persons aged 16-64 in employment (excluding agricultural workers) was 11,517,000 - the same as in June but 511,000 more than in July, 1936.
Employment improved between June and July in coal-mining (following the increase due to temporary causes in the numbers unemployed in June), the distributive trades and the hotel and boarding house, road transport and shipping services.     Employment declined in building and public works contracting,  in the potterygeneral engineering, motor vehicle,    wool textile, clothing, and boot and shoe industries, in textile bleaching, dyeing, finishing, etc., ,and in agriculture.      Owing to local holidays the numbers temporarily stopped in the jute industry increased appreciably.RAILWAY TRAFFIC.      In the five weeks ended 1st August, railway traffic receipts increased by  808,000 (4.59$) as compared with the corresponding period of 1936. Passenger traffic increased by 5.35%, merchandise, minerals and livestock by 3.42^ and &quot;coal,  coke and patent fuel by 4.15%.BANKING.    Although monetary conditions changed very little during July,  there was the slight set-back in discount rates which usually occurs following the hardening of rates at the end of the half-year.      The Treasury Bill rate fluctuated between 11/0.45d.  and 10/0.99d.      The Exchange Equalisation Fund was increased by a further  200 m. Offerings of gold were small and the price declined steadily with the dollar,  falling below 140/-d. for the first time since September, 1936.      Silver business was restricted and price movements unimportant.The dollar fell steadily from 4.94 to 4.98^ - due,possibly, to sales of dollars on Japanese account.      The franc1.fluctuated widely,  falling from 128 16   early in July to 135-g on the 22nd July,  the highest point since November, 1926., The discount on the three months forward rate ranged between 3f - 7 francs.
/ JLSHIPPING.        There was some decline in the volume of chartering on Argentine grain account (not unusual at the time of year) hut freight rates in the South American trade were well maintained.      Time charter rates rose appreciably.    There were indications of a widespread firmness in voyage rates.      The Chamber of Shipping index number of freights (1913 s 100) was 146.41 as compared with 145,09 in June and 88.42 in July,  1936.SHIPBUILDING.    Activity was fairly well maintained and a few good orders were booked.      On the Clyde all sections of the shipbuilding and marine engineering industries were well employed but comparatively few contracts were placed.      On the Tyne orders for new ships were disappointing but further contracts    are expected before the end of the y^ar.      Ship repairers were steadily employed.      At Belfast enquiries fell off somewhat but repairing continued brisk.COAL.    There was a seasonal contraction in inland demand and a lull in export demand.     Production fell to its lowest average level this year.      Output for the four weeks ended 17th July (IS.26 m.  tons) was. however, 1,8 m.  tons more than in the corresponding period a year before.      The improvement in employment was maintained.      Exports in July amounted to 4.13 in.  tons as compared with 3.36 m.  tons a year before.      Most markets took more,  the main increases being to Italy and Prance. An improvement is expected with the revival of the seasonal trade in the autumn.IRON AND STEEL,      Pig iron output (729,300 tons) was 9.6 per cent, more than in July, 1936, and the highest recorded since September, 1920.      Crude steel production (1,059,200 tons despite a substantial decline in Scottish output due to holiday stoppages) was 8.7 per cent. more.     Home demand for
steel was maintained and producers continued to limit forward commitments. Overseas demand remained active and the recent increased level of exports was maintained.The raw material position, improved.      Scrap imports in July amounted to 168,000 tons,  compared with a monthly average of 55,000 tons during January-June.      Pig-iron imports showed a substantial increase over July, 1936, while iron ore imports have advanced appreciably this year.      The average values of scrap,  iron ore and pig-iron imports show large increases compared with a year ago.In Scotland blast furnaces continued operations during the holidays and the suspension of work at steel-works was reduced to a minimum.      On the Horth East Coast output of semi-finished and finished steel reached record proportions and more plant is to be brought into operation.      Spanish ore imports ceased but satisfactory supplies arrived from other sources.      Export demand was active.      In Sheffield steel makers, after a short interval for plant repairs, resumed operating to capacity.      In South Vfeiles demand for heavy finished steel continued strong..      The tinplate industry maintained a high rate of activity.ENGINEERING.      Steady progress was made and the volume of orders in hand and on the books in many cases exceeded available capacity.      New business continued satisfactory. The steel supply position was easier.      Exports of machinery amounted to  4,4. -nr., as compared with  3*9. m,  in July 1936. Imports ( 2.4. m.) were  822,000 more, mainly because of increased imports of machine tools..MOTOR INDUSTRY.      The number of motor vehicles newly registered in June was 40,354 - 6,993 more than a year before; the increase in private cars was 5,756.      The production of private cars in May was 33,093 (8.7% less than a year before)
and of commercial vehicles 10,057 (2.4:% more).      Exports of new private cars and chassis in July amounted to 7,092 and of new commercial vehicles and chassis to 1,878 - 19.8$ and 30.3$ respectively more than in July,  1936,    1,542 complete new private cars were imported as compared with 457 a year ago.ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.      In most classes of installation material and light apparatus, production showed a considerable increase compared with a year ago.      The index for heavy engineering orders for July decreased slightly compared with June but was appreciably higher than in July, 1936.      Exports of electrical apparatus and machinery ( 1*52 me) were 15,3$ greater than a year before.      Electricity generated was 13c2$ more.NON-FERROUS METALS.      Metal markets were quieter and somewhat irregular.      Copper,  tin and spelter prices were higher on balance but lead prices were lower.      Trade buying in this country was partly checked owing to holidays but there were indications of an improvementsCHEMICALS,      Home sales of alkalis were less than in June; exports were at about the same level.     Deliveries of chlorine products showed increases over June and over July, 1936c Sales of nitrogen products continued to increase compared with a year agoc     Home sales of dyestuffs this year are well ahead of sales in 1936;    the recovery in exports continued,     Home sales of sulphate of ammonia for the season 1936-1937 were slightly less than last season;    exports were considerably higher.,     Demand for pharmaceutical chemicals, though rather limited, was steady.WOOL.     General activiti&apos; (which was affected by the annual holidays) declined, particularly in the worsted section.     Raw wool prices hardened slightly.     Exports of tissues and yarns were greater, but of tops loss, than in June;    exports of each group wore less than a year before.      Reports indicated that the general outlook was fair, the position in worsted manufacturior being the least encouraging.
i &apos;1SILK AND ARTIFICIAL SILK.     Rayon.     Apart from a slight slackening due to the holidays, activity in tho weaving trade continued satisfactory.      Crepe yarn prices were reduced in order to meet Continental competition;    the market was slightly unsettled, hut an improvement in demand is anticipated.&quot;     The quieter tendency in the staple fibre trade continued hut business showed a considerable increase over July, 1936. Exports of yarns and all-rayon fabrics showed very large increases over July, 1936, but exports of rayon mixtures declined.Silk.     As usual at this time of year business on the whole was poor.     Raw silk prices tended to weaken.HIDES AND LEATHER.      Hide markets advanced steadily in all parts of tho world and prices rose considerably.      In the leather trade business was rather varied, some sections experiencing an active demand while others were very quiet.BUILDING.      Returns received by the Ministry of Labour from 139 local authorities showed that the estimated cost of buildings for which plans were approved was  9.5 m. - 9;5 per cent, less than the figure for july 1936.      There wore decreases of 7,7 per cent, for dwelling houses and 43.5 per cent, for factories but an increase of 1.4 per cent, for all other buildings and alterations to existing buildings.POTTERY.     The general level of employment in June was substantially higher than a year before.     Demand for general earthenware was not unsatisfactory and for china about normal. Activity in the tiles section continued satisfactory.     Home sales of sanitary earthenware for the first half of 1937 were much less than a year before but export sales increased considerably.RETAIL TRADE.        The money value of average daily retail sales in June was 4.8 per cent, higher than in Juno, 1936 (this compared with an increase of 9.2 por cent,  for February - May,
but June is always a slack month).     Sales of food and perishables rose by 4.5 per cent, and of other merchandise by 5 per cent.     Preliminary returns for July indicate a moderate increase over July, 1936.CANADIAN TRA.DE.     The index of physical volume of business rose further during June.     Total exports increased appreciably and were greater than in any June since 1929.     Compared with May, gold shipments and exports of copper, nickel, zinc, wood-uulp. and planks and boards increased (after seasonal adjustment);    silver shipments and asbestos exports declined. Newsprint production reached a new high point.     The output of iron and steel and motor cars increased.AUSTRALIAN TRADE.      2.9 m. bales of v/ool were sold during the season ended 30th June as compared with 2.79 m. a year before;    the amount realised was  11.08rn. more and the highest since the record return for 1927/28.     Wheat and flour shipments from 1st December, 1936, to 28th July were equivalent to 77 m. bushels of wheat as compared with 71.7 m. a year before.     Butter shipments during July were 2,081 t ons q.s compared with 2,845 tons a year before.      Imports of merchandise during June amounted to  10.51 m.  (Australian currency) as compared with  8.3 m. in June, 1936.SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE.      Stock exchange values remained depressed during June but markets tended to be steadier at the lower levels.     Available statistics gave no indication of any recession in trade.Imports in May were 31.6 per cent, greater than in May, 1936.     Exports (excluding gold) were 39.2 per cent, more, due mainly to greatly increased wool shipments.     Gold exports were 28 per cent, less, but the daily average tonnage of ore crushed was the highest yet recorded.      The maize market remained quiet but active conditions were expected to develop during July.
SOUTH AI.GRICAH TRADE.    Argentina.     Though the rate of export slowed down further during June, total exports for the first half of 1937 were 8&apos;6-9&apos;/0 in volume greater than a year before and the highest yet recorded;    in value they were exceeded only in 1920.      Total imports increased in value by 24//o.-     The favourable balance of trade for January - June, 1937, exceeded all previous figures for complete years, excepting 1919.      Exports to the United Kingdom during January - June were 4Cyo in value greater than a year before, mainly owing to increased wheat shipments.      United States trade with Argentina has expanded appreciably this year.     The United Kingdom share of total imports has declined.Brazil.      Wo satisfactory plan has yet been evolved for the surplus coffee problem and the unsettled state of the Brazilian coffee market is reflected in dull world markets.Chile.      The expansion in exports, particularly copper, continued.     Exports to the United Kingdom during January -June, 1937, were 84;o greater in value than a year before.Uruguay.      The farming industry is enjoying increased prosperity.Peru.      Imports for January - April, 1937, were slightly less than a year before;    exports increased substantially. The export surplus is more than double.that of last year.Colombia.      Imports of cotton piece goods and woollen and worsted yarns.and manufactures from the United Kingdom during the first half of 1937 were together nearly 40;0 greater in value than a year before.
