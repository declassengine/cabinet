THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1937.SECRET Copy No.CP. 218 (37).CABINET.ANGLO-GERMAN RELATIONS.Memorandum, by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a despatch from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Berlin describing his impressions of the National Socialist Party Rally recently held at Nuremberg and recording conversations he had on that occasion with Herr Hitler, General Goring, Dr. Goebbels and Baron von Neurath.At his interview with General Goring, Sir N. Henderson carried a stage further his exploration of the aims of German policy which he has undertaken on my instructions. Previous papers on this subject have already been circulated to my colleagues in CP. 202 (37) of the 30th July, 1937. It will be observed that Sir N. Henderson is to have, a further meeting with General Goring in East Prussia at the beginning of October, when he hopes to receive from the general an authoritative statement which has Herr Hitler&apos;s approval.As regards the Nuremberg Rally itself, Sir N. Henderson records his impressions, first, that the greater calm and sedateness of the 1937 meeting is due to confidence in German strength, to the realisation of achievement, and to optimism and faith in the future; and, secondly, that there is an increasing adulation of Herr Hitler himself, amounting almost to idolisatiomI have, however, noted that the reports of others who have been able from personal experience to compare this year&apos;s rally with those of preceding years do not fully confirm these impressions. On the one hand, it has been said that the key-note of the recent Nuremberg meeting was grimness rather than gaiety, attributable to anxieties about the internal situation, and that there was an air of strain about the leaders who were present; and, on the other hand, it has frequently been observed that criticism of the regime has, in recent months, become more widespread and more open in Germany than in the past. In any event, I should doubt whether the charged atmosphere of Nuremberg is the best in which to obtain a true picture of Germany as a whole, with her weaknesses and -discontents as well as her strength and enthusiasm.

EC 6494/4222/18]ANNEX.Sir N. Henderson to Mr. Eden.-(Received September 16.) (No. 831.   Most Confidential.)Sir, . Berlin, September 12, 1937.I HAVE the honour to furnish you herewith with the following report on my visit to Nuremberg on the 10th and 11th instant to attend the National Socialist party day. &apos; &apos;2. I left Berlin on the evening of the 9th September by the special train which had been reserved for those members of the Diplomatic Corps who had not gone to Nuremberg for the beginning of the meeting. Among these were the Chinese Ambassador, the Belgian, Dutch, Danish and Egyptian Ministers and the United States Charge d&apos;Affaires, &amp;c. We were accompanied by a inember of the Protocol and everything from beginning to end, tickets, food, motor cars, news-papers at Nuremberg, &amp;c, was provided free of charge.3. We arrived early in the morning of the 10th at Nuremberg, where our party was joined by the French Ambassador, who had come direct there from Paris. To each foreign representative was attached an adjutant supplied by volunteers from the S.S.; in my own case a lieutenant from that corps, by pro-fession a lawyer in Berlin who had been born near Bradford and had served throughout the war as an artillery officer. He spoke English perfectly, had studied Karl Marx and proved a most agreeable guide and companion. Similarly to Mr. Gilbert, the United States Charge dAffaires, was attached an S.S. nOn-oommissioned officer who, judging by his accent and behaviour, could never have been mistaken for anything else but a 100 per cent. American from New York; though, in point of fact, he had learnt his language entirely in Ireland during the construction of the Shannon works, where he was employed as an engineer. Another instance of the attention given to every detail was the care with which, though we drove to the various functions in pairs, it was provided that, since His Majesty&apos;s Government do not recognise Franco, I should never find myself in the same motor as the Nationalist Spanish Ambassador, who happens to rank next to me in the hierarchy of the Diplomatic Corps.4. I spent the morning of the 10 th driving round the highly decorated and fascinating mediaeval town with its ancient and formerly impregnable ram-parts, and getting some impression of the crowd. The predominant note was, of course, S.A. brownshirts or S.S. black uniforms, but one was struck by the number of women in Bavarian national costume, the wearing of which is much encouraged by Hitler. All the troops and the various formations live outside the town in tents or temporary wooden accommodation, and the number who get Nuremberg leave is strictly limited to the street capacity, at any given time of the city.5. At 1 - 30 a lunch was given to the foreign representatives by Herr Hess in the old Burg on the top of the hill with its magnificent view over the town and the surrounding country. I was fortunate to find myself at lunch between the two men whom, on admittedly slight personal acquaintance but in accordance with the consensus of opinion, I distrust most in Germany Dr. Goebbels and Herr Himmler, the leader of the S.S. and of all the police, secret and otherwise, in the country. After a somewhat sticky beginning with Goebbels, both made them-selves extremely agreeable, and a memorandum of my conversation with the Minister for Propaganda is attached to this report.6. After lunch we retired in a body to our diplomatic special trains, which were drawn up in a siding at the North Station. Each representative was allotted a double sleeping compartment and there were two general dining-cars. During the brief interval between lunch and tea with the Chancellor, I had talks with Peuter&apos;s representative and Mr. Ward Price of the Daily Mail. I also saw the Times correspondent later.
7. At 4-30 we left again for the &quot; Deutscher Hof,&quot; the residence of the. Chancellor during his stay in Nuremberg. Drawn up in line in the big drawing.-, room there, Hitler shook hands with each of us and we were then asked to sit ddwn at small tables for.tea. . Most of the Ambassadors, headed by M. Francpis-Poncet,&apos; the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps, hurriedly made a semi-circle in front, of Hitler, who was seated on. a large sofa. The Chinaman, the Nationalist Spaniard and myself, being the junior Ambassadors present, were not included in this circle. After some twenty minutes, however, the head of the Protocol, approached me where I was sitting with Baron von Neurath and the Chinesei Ambassador and asked whether I would not join the circle. As there was no room except on the sofa where Hitler himself was sitting, I replied that I thought, it better not, unless the Chancellor himself expressed the wish.. Herr von Billow Schwante, however, insisted, so I followed him across the room and was rewarded, by being invited to share the sofa. As the other Ambassadors then promptly, rose and left in a body, I had a few minutes alone with Hitler and was able to, give the message which you,.Sir, had instructed me to communicate to him. A report on our conversation is attached hereto.8.   The reception was thereafter concluded by a speech of welcome by the. Chancellor, in which Hitler expressed the hope that more suitable accommodation, would be found for his guests in the future, when things would be better; arranged.  The French Ambassador, as dean, replied on behalf of the diplomats.. His allusion to a statement made by Goebbels in a speech on the day before about &apos;&apos; the liberal calves &apos;&apos; of more democratic countries was regarded as Gallic wit, and he ended with the graceful remark that, as the Party Day of 1937 was called the Meeting of Labour, the diplomatic train should be described this year as that of goodwill.9. I also met at this party Herr von Ribbentrop and the new German Ambassador to Salamanca, Dr. von Stohrer, with whom I was previously acquainted when he was German Minister at Cairo. Possibly quite erroneously, Herr von Ribbentrop gave me the impression of being unfriendly. He has no justification for such an attitude, since, though I hear from others many things which are disobliging towards him, I have always been careful to refrain from any criticism of him, however just I may feel it to be. The only conclusion I can draw is that his reception by Hitler has not been on this occasion as favourable as usual. If so, he would have reason for gloom, as, from all I hear, it may be. said without exaggeration that Hitler is his only friend in this country.10. From the Deutscher Hof we returned to the special train for an hour or so before proceeding to the stadium (Zeppelinfeld) for the gathering of the political leaders of the Nazi party, i:e., the heads of the party organisation in the towns and villages throughout the country. This began at about 8 p.m. One hundred and forty thousand of these leaders in brown shirts were drawn up, partly in six huge columns in the stadium itself and partly in the surrounding tiers, the big new northern block facing the stadium being reserved for the Chancellor, his special guards, bands, visitors and spectators, &amp;c. To get to his platform, Hitler, with some hundred of his followers, marched on foot from the southern end of the stadium amidst great applause up the broad middle lane, some 300-400 yards long, to the central block. On his arrival at the far end and as he entered the stadium the 300 huge searchlights surrounding it were turned up into the air, each throwing a broad blue beam some 20,000 feet or more into the sky, where the lights converged to make a square roof which a chance cloud made even more realistic. The effect, both solemn and beautiful, was something like being inside a cathedral of ice. At the word of command 32,000 standard-bearers then advanced from out of sight at the southern end up the main lane and over the furthest tiers and down the four side lanes. The standards were illuminated by lights on the shafts of a certain proportion of them, and the &apos; spectacle of these five rivers of red and gold, one broad and four smaller, rippling slowly forward under the dome of blue lights through the massed formations of brown shirts, and absolutely silently, till, about a hundred yards from where we were sitting, suddenly the tramp of feet was heard, was indescribably beautiful. I have never seen a ballet to touch it. Speeches were then made, adulatory by the spokesman of the political leaders on the one hand, confident and under the-emotion of great achievement by Hitler on the other. Nor should criticism be carping. The visible result of Hitlerism was only too obvious. As he himself said in his speech, these party leaders, 140,000 strong, represented 2 million men [15877] B 2
of whom only 3 per cent., and that, he added, still too much, were paid for their services. Ninety-seven per cent, were entirely voluntary, and they certainly represented force as well as creating a scene of beauty.11. The whole ceremony lasted little over an hour, after which we retired to our special train to supper and to bed.12. In the night it started to pour with rain and it was still raining hard when we set out again before 9 a.m. to attend the rally of the Hitler youth. The rain occasioned for the diplomats the only hitch in arrangements which were otherwise unexceptionable. Owing to the weather and in order to save the youth from standing out too long in the downpour, the hour of the meeting was unexpectedly advanced and the diplomats thus arrived simultaneously with Hitler a contretemps which involved a hundred yards&apos; walk in the mud for the diplomats, and some fluster. The rally of the youth was held in a smaller stadium with a grass lawn. Here were gathered 48,000 boys and 5,000 girls, mostly in the surrounding tiers of seats, but with some 11,000 of the senior youths between 17 and 18 years old drawn up in column in the middle. These latter were they who were being allowed by selection to join the party this year and were to swear the oath of fidelity to Adolf Hitler and duty to the party for the honour and greatness of Germany. Standards, music and singing again played the big part, the standard-bearers advancing from opposite sides and interweaving in front of the Puhrer. Three speeches were made: by Baldur von Schirach, the leader of the Hitler Youth, by Hitler himself and by Herr Hess, who administered the oath, which was sworn with great fervour by the 11,000 odd boys in the middle. I was struck by von Schirach&apos;s address which was delivered in a pleasant voice, was brief and very much to the point. However adulatory to Hitler, I could well imagine youth being stirred by it. After referring to the two innovations of this year, the Adolf Hitler schools (a form of secondary schools destined particularly to educate up leaders for the nation) and certain new sporting competitions, he said, incidentally, speaking to the boys : &quot; When I look at you, my comrades, I do not know whether your fathers are rich or poor. But I do know that it is you who are the youth of national-socialism. I do not know if you are Protestants or Catholics : but that you believe in God, that I do know.&quot; Hitler himself began by making a point out of the bad weather : Germany, he said, had suffered from such weather conditions for fifteen years, and the struggle had been long and hard in order that the sun should rise again over Germany. &quot; And,&quot; he added, with that new note of confidence which so impressed me everywhere at Nuremburg, &quot; it has risen.&quot;13. General Blomberg was present at this meeting, but I did not manage to get an opportunity to speak to him as I should have liked to do. In the course of the morning, however, I called on Baron von Neuratih who has very inadequate temporary offices for his Ministry at the Grand Hotel. A record of this conversation is also attached hereto.14. Lunch was taken on the special train. Owing to the weather the afternoon show consisting of semi-military sports was cancelled so far as concerned the diplomats, who were invited instead to a war cinema performance. I had, however, arranged to see General Goring that afternoon in the little shooting lodge which he occupied for the.Nuremburg meeting, some forty minutes&apos; drive outside the town. Thither I proceeded about 4 p.m. and the report of my conversation with him is contained in the fourth annex to this report.15. The final act of these busy thirty-six hours consisted in a supper party given by the S.S. Leader Herr Himmler, in his camp of 25,000 S.S. men under tents on the outskirts of the town. A further 25,000 S.S. are on duty during the meeting as guards, traffic managers and police in Nuremberg itself. In the camp, which is a self-contained unit, all are voluntary visitors to Nuremberg from every part of the country, and a tougher set of guys I have rarely seen. But discipline is strict in this elite of the German para-military formations, numbering well over 200,000 altogether. Everyone has to be back in camp, unless specially authorised, by 6 p.m. and lights out by 9-30. Supper, consisting of the famous Nuremberg sausages with cabbage and potato salad, cheese and Bavarian beer, was held in a large tent holding some 300 person. Himmler made a brief speech of welcome to his guests and the Polish Ambassador replied on behalf of the latter. Each of the guests received a bowl of S.S. china filled with sweets, the china being made in a special S.S. pottery run, so I understand, on voluntary lines.   At the supper I found myself sitting between Frau von
Ribbentrop and Herr Bohle, the leader of the organisation of Germans abroad. Opposite me was the German Ambassador at Rome, Herr von Hassell, who as Minister at Belgrade was a good friend of mine. Among the guests of honour were the two Mitford girls whom, as vamps of Hitler, I would have been glad to meet, but I failed to make their acquaintance. A number of Italian officers, the advance party of the Mussolini visit, were much in evidence. Herr Bohle told me that he was proceeding to London in the first days of October to lecture in some hall on the Nazi organisations abroad and mentioned that the Evening Standard had arranged a &quot;man-to-man talk&quot; between him and Mr. Winston Churchill. I was astonished to hear from Herr Bohle that the total number of members of the Nazi party in London was only 280 or at most 300. He has recently divested himself of his British nationality. His younger sister, who is married to an American from Philadelphia, living in Berlin, has, however, so he told me, remained a British subject.16. During supper a number of songs were sung by a detachment of S.S. troopers, and after supper there was a tattoo for the lowering of the swastika camp flag. The music, as well as the bearing and drill of the special detachment, was exceptionally good. But the camp in the darkness, though partly lit up by electric light and flares, with the black uniforms in the silent background, and the skull and crossbones on the drums and trumpets, lent to the scene a somewhat sinister and menacing impression. Under that temporary impression I left, together with the United States Charge&quot; d&apos;Affaires, the Egyptian and one or two other Ministers, direct to catch the train about 11-30 p.m. for Berlin, whither I returned at 7-75 a.m. this morning.17. I have already described, in my telegram No. 218, the chief impressions created on me by this visit and by the proceedings so far of the 1937 Nuremberg Party Day. I would repeat that, in the first place, so far as it was possible in the cramped quarters of a train (three nights and two days altogether was my personal experience) everything was done to make our accommodation as comfortable as possible. Telephones were provided in each compartment, the food and drink was excellent, a motor ;car always at one&apos;s disposal, one&apos;s adjutant always at hand and the officials of the protocol unremittingly attentive. Throughout my stay I neither saw nor heard anything to which as His Majesty&apos;s representative I could properly have taken exception. Had I studied every speech made by excitable leaders on occasions at which I was not present, I might well have found food for criticism. But that, I submit, is hardly the point. In general and up to date, the party meeting of 1937 has, in fact, been conducted on much more sedate and quieter lines than hitherto. This I attribute in part to the presence in Nuremberg for the first time of the whole Diplomatic Body with the exception of the Papal Nuncio and the Soviet representative. But to a greater extent this improvement is due to the growing confidence of Hitler, and of every German, in the strength of Germany and the success of the Nazi experiment.18. There is, indeed, no doubt whatsoever that we are here witnessing in Germany the rebirth, the reorganisation and the unification of the German nation. One may criticise and disapprove, one may thoroughly dislike the threatened consummation and be apprehensive of its potentialities. But let us make no mistake. A machine is being built up in Germany, which in the course of this generation, if it proceeds unchecked, as there is no reason to believe that it will not, will be extraordinarily formidable. The system was started less than five years ago, but the amazing energy and thoroughness with which it has been enforced in those few years has already made it redoubtable enough. To-day Germany, as was reported in my despatch No. 793 of the 1st September, can no longer be attacked with impunity, not even by a combination of forces. After a few more years aggressive action will be well within its scope. It is to confidence in this German strength, the realisation of achievement, optimism and faith in the future that I mainly attribute the greater calm and sedateness of the 1937 meeting. The need for ballyhoo propaganda and startling effect, for furious declamation and frenzied incentive is diminishing. Germany to-day feels that she can not only afford to wait, but by waiting will be yet stronger and more.sure of her goal. And the big goal is German unity. Of that let there be no mistake either; and, if we intend definitely to oppose it, we should lose no time in asking ourselves the first and capital question &quot; How ? &quot;... .[15877] b 3
19. Be that as it may, as I reported in my despatch above quoted, and as General Goring admitted to me yesterday, the one and only fly in the German ointment is economics.. The system is beginning to show concrete results and the general outcome is to-day an exceedingly, and to-morrow an abnormally, powerful and dangerous nation, confident in its own strength. Hitler himself alluded to this in his opening proclamation when he said that the Versailles Treaty was dead, Germany was free and her safety guaranteed by her own force. That statement, together with his insistence on the actual achievements and the ideology of his regime, I regard as the keynote of the meeting of 1937. In the background stand the unity of the German peoples and the reminder that Germany means to persist in her demand for colonies.20. Nevertheless, the watchword for the moment is, I am convinced, to go slow because it will pay for Germany to go slow. Germany does not want adventure, lest adventure risk the success of the young organisation which is beginning to show such Avonderful results. General Goring asked me yesterday whom I regarded as the greatest winners of the world war. I replied : &quot; The Slav nations.&quot; &quot;No,&quot; said Goring, &quot;Germany&quot;; for without its disasters Germany could never have achieved that unity and regeneration which she was now in course of accomplishing. There are signs, also, that Hitler himself is beginning to feel himself hampered by the excessiye zeal of some of his deputies. Baron von Neurath told me that the Chancellor had recently asked him where a good man could be found to explain to the foreign world the true aims and constitution of nazism. According to von Neurath, this enquiry had struck him as a criticism of Goebbels&apos;s capacity for antagonising foreign public opinion. Herr Bohle&apos;s forthcoming visit to London gave me similarly the impression of being undertaken at Hitler&apos;s orders, and Bohle&apos;s language to me was of the most moderate and reasonable nature. All this leads me to believe that we are perhaps entering upon a quieter phase of nazism, of which the first indication has been the greater tranquillity of the 1937 meeting. The excesses of subordinates cannot be checked in a moment&apos;s time; they will continue, nor will any definite aim be abandoned, with Austria as the first objective. I would interpolate in this connexion that, in my opinion, the crux of the forthcoming Mussolini visit will not be the Berlin-Rome axis against the world, but rather the future of Austria. Nevertheless, Hitler himself contemplates, I believe, setting his course on lines of greater, always from the German point of view, let it be said, reasonableness.21. This leads me to a second definite impression, which I did not mention in my above-quoted telegram, namely, a renewal of hope in the achievement of good relations with Great Britain. Evidence of this is given in the accompanying memoranda, but I would state here that Hitler&apos;s desire for greater reasonableness is, I believe, a part of this renewed belief in the possibility of an Anglo-German understanding. By what he regards as reasonableness, he hopes to conciliate the good opinion of England.22. My third definite impression is the increasing adulation, amounting almost to idolisation, of Hitler himself. He must indeed have a strong head if he is to continue to keep his balance in the floods of incense with which he is surrounded. I must admit that, so far, I see no very visible sign of this worship going to his head. But he will have to be superhuman to resist it. I sometimes wonder whether nazism would best be served by his continuing to lead and direct it, or by his disappearance. In the latter event, especially if it be martyrdom, the Hitler tradition might well prove a religion which would be in the end even more formidable than the man himself, who, being fallible, must ultimately make mistakes which so far, it must be recognised, he has succeeded in avoiding. As a national force nazism is infinitely more to be feared than fascism, owing to the different characteristics of the two peoples. From the point of view of organisa-tion, discipline and malleableness, the Italian cannot be compared to the German race. Germany is admittedly subject to great ups and downs, but for this generation, which is what chiefly matters to us, Germany is being drilled to think and, if necessary, to act as one man wishes her to do.I have, &amp;c.NEVILE HENDERSON.
Enclosure 1.Memorandum of Conversation with Dr. Goebbels.I SAT next to Dr. Goebbels at Herr Hess&apos;s luncheon to the Diplomatic Body at the Nuremberg Citadel on the 10th September.As I had heard that he had made some unnecessarily offensive remarks about liberal countries on the preceding day, I told him that I thought it was a pity not to try and create a better press atmosphere in our two countries instead of exacerbating it by disagreeable language. I told him that, to my intense surprise, I had learnt that morning that his press bureau had expressed dissatisfaction with the attitude of the British press towards the Nuremberg celebrations. I had myself read the Daily Telegraph, the Evening Standard and even (in spite of Ebbutt) the Times, and had been very pleasantly impressed by the friendliness of their language. Of course, there were thorns in every rose; that was inevitable, and the Germans could not expect us to fall flat in admiration. But the general sense and tone was the main point, and I hoped that he would instruct his subordinates to judge by the main lines, and not by the minor criticisms. A better understanding, which I personally earnestly desired, between our two countries must in the first place rest on a better mutual comprehension, which could only be achieved through the press. Could I, I asked him, count on his co-operation ?Dr. Goebbels began by referring to the von Langen-Ebbutt incident. He denied that von Langen had been asked to leave Italy and complained that he had been unfairly treated in England. He had barely arrived there and had given no actual cause for his expulsion. I told Goebbels that the action&apos; taken against von Langen had been a purely Home Office affair. It had nothing to do with the Foreign Office, and I personally was not even aware of the exact grounds which had led to his expulsion. Expulsions in England were never undertaken without full consideration and very good reason. Though I might be sorry for von Langen and regretted that it had not been possible to publish the exact motives for his expulsion, nothing, and least of all Germany&apos;s interests, could justify the reprisals taken against Ebbutt. Only the latter had profited; he had long wanted to leave Berlin and he had been enabled to depart as a martyr with an advertise-ment worth several thousand pounds to him. On the other hand, the Times, which before was not at all unfriendly, had been indisposed. . .Goebbels admitted that the result had been unsatisfactory from Germany&apos;s point of view. He expressed, however, the hope that in future, if His Majesty&apos;s Government wished to get rid of any German press correspondent, he could be informed beforehand. He would, in that case, at once remove the offender with-out making any fuss whatsoever. I had only to mention the matter and action would be taken. I undertook to convey this request to the Foreign Office. I would mention here that Herr Bohle, the next day, expressed an identical request to me as regards any member of the Nazi party in London. Both requests seem to me reasonable and, if undesirable incidents are to be avoided, I would beg that they be taken into consideration.Speaking generally, Dr. Goebbels professed, as he has done before, keen anxiety to co-operate with me in any way that might be possible. I could only refer to the inherent difference between the completely independent British and the completely Government-controlled German presses. But so far as I could lelp to make nazism better understood in England, I undertook to do so.As regards the general situation, Dr. Goebbels spoke very pacifistically. Germany wished for no adventures. Nazism was advancing by great strides, but it had got to learn to run of its own momentum and nothing must be done to risk the fulfilment of its development. Germany wanted peace above all else. In the -course of time many thorny questions would settle themselves and in the meantime mazism must continue to be built up in quiet and tranquillity.N. H.September 12, 1937.
Enclosure 2.Memorandum of a Conversation with Herr Hitler on September 10.I TOLD the Chancellor that I had recently been to London and had the opportunity to speak with the Secretary of State. Mr. Eden had asked me to tell his Excellency that, as the Prime Minister had stated in the House of Commons, the invitation to Baron von Neurath to visit London remained open. Mr. Eden felt, however, that it was next time for the Chancellor himself to suggest a suitable moment for a visit to take place. The best course would, I said, be for Hitler himself to give me a hint that he considered it desirable for his Minister to establish contact with His Majesty&apos;s Government. If and when he gave me such a hint, I would be glad to convey it confidentially to the Secretary of State.Hitler, in thanking me for this communication, observed that the trouble on the previous occasion had been that the English press, though extremely favour-able, had given the impression that great and immediate results might be expected from Neurath&apos;&apos;s visit. A disappointment in this respect would have produced an entirely contrary result to that desired. The danger was of raising excesssive hopes.I admitted this. Except for the colonial question, an exceedingly compli-cated one which, in my opinion, could never be settled without careful preparation and the prior creation of a very different atmosphere to that which existed at present, there were no outstanding questions between our two countries, such as existed between ourselves and France in 1904. To this Hitler replied that the first problem to be solved was that of the press and in particular the British attitude towards Nazism. In this connexion, I mentioned to his Excellency the substance of my conversation earlier in the day on this point with Dr. Goebbels.In general Hitler seemed to me more friendly, calmer and more reasonable than on the two previous occasions on which I have met him. He made some amiable reference to my presence in Nuremberg for the Party Day. The whole conversation lasted less than ten minutes, and I myself put an end to it by getting up from the sofa, where we were sitting under the eyes of some thirty or more of my diplomatic colleagues.N. H.September 12, 1937.Enclosure 3.Memorandum of a Conversation with Baron von Neurath at Nuremberg.I CALLED on the Reichsminister in the morning of the 11th September at the Grand Hotel. I began by asking if the Chancellor had mentioned what I had. said to the latter at the reception on the preceding day. Baron von Neurath said that he had, but gave me no indication as to when a German contact in London, might seem to him desirable. Nor did I consider it expedient in any way to press-the matter. As soon as the Italian visit is over Baron von Neurath told me that he proposed to retire once more to a country house he possesses in the Vorarlberg-mountains. He mentioned as regards MussolinFs visit that it would be a purely Italo-German affair, to which not even the friends of the Berlin-Rome axis would) be invited.His Excellency told me that, not having seen Hitler before Nuremberg for some time, he had been agreeably surprised to find him once again less resentful against and thoroughly anxious for a better understanding with Great Britain. I repeated to His Excellency what I had said to Hitler about the difficulty of coming to anything more than a general understanding when there were no-tangible points, except the colonial question, outstanding between us. In this connexion I told Baron von Neurath of my conversation with General Goring before leaving for Marienbad (Baron von Neurath had already left Berlin before that date and I had not seen him since). As His Excellency seemed to know something but little about that conversation, I explained its origins and mentioned!
Enclosure 4.Memorandum of a Conversation with General Goring at Nuremberg onSeptember 11, 1937.AFTER some talk about the forthcoming Hunting Exhibition in Berlin next November and British participation thereat, I asked General Goring whether he could now give me, as he had promised to do, the written reply (see my despatch No. 678 of the 20th July last) to my request for information as to (a) Germany&apos;s concrete grievances against Great Britain in the matter of &quot; hemming her in,&quot; and (b) Germany&apos;s ultimate aims.General Goring replied that the latter was impossible without Herr Hitler&apos;s consent and that, though he could do the former on his own initiative, he had not done so. I told the general that I hoped in that case he would consult the Chancellor and let me have replies to both questions. After Nuremberg I was going on leave in Austria and Yugoslavia, but I would be back at Berlin for a day Or so at the beginning of October before proceeding to London. Would he let me have the answers by the 2nd October ? The general replied that, after the manoeuvres and Mussolini&apos;s visit, he himself was going to Romintin in East Prussia to shoot stags. He would be there alone between the 2nd and 6th October. If I would join him there, I could have both the answers and a stag. I replied that if that was a definite invitation, I would not hesitate to accept it. The general said that it was and undertook to send full instructions to the Embassy during my absence as to the journey. I could leave Berlin on the evening of the 2nd October and be at Romintin the following morning.He then proceeded to give me, subject to what Hitler might say, his personal ideas as to what Germany&apos;s aims were, or should be, adding that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be astonished at German moderation. The &quot; Anschluss &quot; was a matter of course and inevitable. Herr Schmidt, the Austrian Minister for Foreign Affairs, had visited him a few days before. The general had told him brutally that the sooner the Austrian Government accepted the inevitable without creating bad blood, the better it would be for all concerned. I asked the general what Herr Schmidt had replied to that &quot; That Schuschnigg would never be strong enough to put the matter through,&quot; the general replied.the memorandum I had left, behind. I told the Minister that I was going to see the general later, and though, especially since the latter had not consulted him; I did not anticipate that I would get that afternoon a written reply to the two points raised therein, namely, the causes of Germany&apos;s grievances against Great Britain and Germany&apos;s future aims, I intended to press for one. I should be in London again in the middle of September; you were interested and had reminded me by telegraph two days before that General Goring had promised such a reply, and, indeed, it might possibly serve as the first stepping stone to a renewal of contact. Could he tell me what were Germany&apos;s ultimate aims? &quot;Austria,&quot; replied Herr von Neurath, &quot; that is the first and last of our aims.&quot; The Sudetendeutschen were a matter for compromise, and could be amicably settled if Czechoslovakia left the Russian orbit and gave true equality to her German subjects. I have never known Baron von Neurath so definite before, and the note of confidence with which he spoke was remarkable. He had obviously been seeing a good deal of the Chancellor during the festival and seemed happy about it.I mentioned the Nyon Conference to him. He appeared to be glad to be out of it, and added that the German Government, if asked to do so, hoped to be able to co-operate in any measures which might be decided upon. In any case there were, he said, no German U-boats in the Mediterranean, and the further he could keep all German warships from those waters the better pleased he would be. He complained that he could not definitely discover how many submarines General Franco possessed. According to his reports their numbers were quoted sometimes as low as three, sometimes as high as six. I asked if there were not any German sailors with Franco&apos;s navy, and he told me that so far as he knew there were none at all.N. H.September 12, 1937.
The Sudetendeutschen were a more complicated problem, but once Austria entered the German Reich, the Czechs would be obliged to do something for their German subjects or lose them. Poland was an easier matter, the Corridor could. be solved without difficulty, as could Silesia. I asked him about the Germans in the Tyrol south of the Brenner, mentioning that a German had recently told me that they also were a German aim. To this General Goring replied that it could have been no one in authority, for Italian Tyrolese were certainly not a German aspiration. Germany meant to be moderate and not incur the enmity of the whole-world; she had learnt her lesson. The stronger Germany became, the more restraint she would show. Even if he was not allowed to. put down in writing Germany&apos;s aims, lest if one were omitted England should rise up and say &quot; No &quot; again, he would at least be ready to state-what were not her aims. She could definitely say that she desired nothing in the West, nor in the South, nor in the. North. Nor did she want any single thing which Great Britain possessed. She wanted to be friends with the British Empire : she was prepared to fight herself for the maintenance of that Empire, and would, if need be, lend half her army for that purpose. In return, all she asked was for Great Britain to guard Germany&apos;s rear and for the British navy to keep Germany&apos;s communications open if she was attacked in the East. It was the ideal alliance, the British navy and Ge7&apos;many&apos;s armies. He wished for it with his whole heart, and so did Hitler. An understanding with England could be made in two articles : (1) Germany recognised British interests overseas and the maintenance of her Empire, and (2) Great Britain recognised Germany&apos;s preponderating influence in Central Europe. A rider might be added as to British willingness to discuss the colonial question, though it was not any of the British colonies which Germany wanted.. She wanted nothing from Great Britain.On the other hand, if Great Britain refused all collaboration, Germany would have nothing for it but to prepare for that contingency, and to devote herself to the destruction of the British Empire instead of its maintenance. When I observed that its destruction might not prove so easy as all that, the general went off into a panegyric of Germany&apos;s strength. And, he added, if England was unwilling to help Germany to protect her communications by sea, there would be no alternative but for her to revise the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and to* protect herself on sea by her own resources.All this sounds very bellicose, but, in point of fact, the conversation was conducted on friendly lines. The general was crude and haig, but, I think, quite sincere in his desire for good relations with England. He kept insisting on Germany&apos;s moderation, her wish, in her own interests, to avoid adventure, and her intention as she grew stronger to settle down. I made no comments on his description of Germany&apos;s aims, because I wished him to show his full hand in1 this respect. But we wrangled amicably about the upshot of a future war and the comparative military strengths of Germany and the British Empire. He confessed that Germany&apos;s one difficulty was economics, but with him, as with the others whom I met at Nuremberg, the note of confidence in Germany&apos;s growing -might was very apparent.The trouble is that no German honestly can understand why England should wish to prevent Germans from being included in Germany. They comprehend that it is France&apos;s traditional policy to oppose Germany unity, but they do not see why England should be so interested. Crude though he may be, General Goring, as an ex-combatant and aviator, is friendly-disposed both to England and France. He is extremely intelligent, astute as well as very ambitious, but at the-same time he is the frankest and most sincere of these Nazi leaders, with the exception of Hitler. I had, to tell the truth, little hope that I should get answers to my questions out of him at the first attempt. I nope that now, with Baron von Neurath&apos;s co-operation, I shall succeed in doing so at Romintin, and that I shall there be furnished with something authoritative which has Hitler&apos;s-approval.N.
