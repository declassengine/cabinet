afffijffiMENT OF IRISH-AMERICAN DELEGATES.I1^   tt^lM*S2at. -4Dublin Castle,14$ June, 1919.The allegations set forth in the statement of the Irish-American delegates are concisely and specifically dealt with in the appended memorandum. By way of preface to the latter I desire to reproduce an extract from a speech delivered by the late Mr. John Redmond, M.P., at an Australian Banquet in 1915 which supplies an illuminating commentary on the alleged ill-treatment of Ireland by the British Government, together with an extract from the Report made to His Majesty the King by the Right Hon. Mr. Justice Dodd, the Special Commissioner appointed by Act of Parliament to investigate charges preferred in connection with the treatment of Sinn Fein prisoners in Belfast Prison in June, 1918.IAN  MACPHERSON,Chief Secretary for Ireland.EXTRACT FROM A SPEECHDELIVERED BYMr. JOHN REDMOND, M.P., at an Australian Banquet in 1915.Referring to the condition of Ireland about 80 years previously, when he first visited Australia, Mr. Redmond&apos; stated : &quot;I went to&apos; Australia to make an appeal on behalf of an enslaved, famine-hunted, despair-ing people, a people in the throes of a semi-revolution, bereft of all political liberties and engaged in a life and death struggle with the system of a most brutal and drastic coercion. Only thirty-three or thirty-four years have passed since then, but what a revolution has occurred in the interval. To-day the people, broadly speaking, own the soil; to-day the labourers live in decent habitations; to-day there is absolute freedom in the local govern-ment and the local taxation of the country; to-day we have the widest Parliament in the muni-eipal franchise; to-day we know that the evicted tenants, who are the wounded soldiers of the land war, have been restored to their horned or to other homes as good as those from which they had been originally driven. We know that the congested districts, the scene of some of the most awful horrors of the old famine days, have been transformed, that the farms have been enlarged, decent dwellings have been provided, and a new spirit of hope and independence is to-day amongst the people. We know that the towns legislation has been passed facilitating thehousing of the working classes. So far as the town tenants are concerned, we have this con-solation, that we have passed for Ireland an Act whereby they are protected against arbitrary eviction, and are given compensation not only for disturbance from their homes, but for the goodwill of the business they had created a piece of legislation far in advance of anything. obtained for the town tenants of England. I may add, far in advance of any legislation ob-tained for the town tenants of any other country. We know that we have at last won educational freedom in university education for most of the youth of Ireland, and we know, that in primary and standard education the thirty-four years that have passed have witnessed an enormous ad-vance in efficiency and in the means provided for bringing efficiency about. &apos; To-day we have a - system of old age pensions in Ireland whereby every old man and woman over seventy is saved from the workhouse, free to spend their last days in comparative comfort. We have a system of national industrial insurance which provides for the health of the people and makes it impossible for the poor hard-working man and woman, when sickness comes to the door, to be carried away to the workhouse hospital, and makes it certain that they will receive decent Christian treatment during their illness.&quot;
438EXTRACT FROM REPORTBY THERight Honourable Mr. Justice DODD of the Proceedings at the Inquiry directed by the special commission (Belfast Prison) Act, 1918.To sum up the findings I have already given, I am satisfied that I had the full facts before me, It is quite clear there was no foundation for any complaint as to food against the Gov-erhor. The food was under the control of the Pood Controller. It is equally clear that the accusation as to ventilation is without any foun-dation. The cells, in fact, are uniform. The door opens into the cell, and the window is opposite the door. AY hat the prisoners were deprived of was the liberty theretofore accorded to them of placing the window level with the sill, a liberty which they abused by creating tumult in their cells and on the roadway. They were removed from that wing, with all possible consideration and humanity. The accusations of harsh treatment are completely disproved. The charges as to foul cells or foul clothes were also disproved. The evidence was conclusive. The Charges against the Governor and Warder and Doctor in this respect were peculiarly cruel. The hose was directed to dislodge two prisoners who had barricaded themselves in their cells, and who succumbed to the attack by water after having successfully resisted direct attacks upon the door. The manacling of the hands of three prisoners behind their backs, who had previously smashed their handcuffs in front, gave me some concern; but, as I have indicated, I find the treatment, though severe, was salutary, and did not heed to be repeated. And finally, I am satisfied that the continuing the prisoners in restraint at Mass and at Communion was ren-dered necessary by the acts of the prisonersthemselves, and was done solely for the preser-vation of the peace. I cannot resist the body of testimony upon this head.The Head Warder, himself a Catholic, the members of the General Prisons&apos; Board, the Solicitor-General for Ireland, all concur in saying that the Governor could not within his duty have removed the restraint. Inside that duty he did all that could be reasonably done. He sought and did not get an undertaking. The Chaplain made no objection, and for the continuing of the restraint the prisoners themselves were respon-sible. The Governor was largely justified by success. At noon on that day the undertakings were given and the restraint removed.I desire in a very special way to humbly request of your Gracious Majesty some recogni-tion of the faithful and loyal work of Head Warder Bowe and the Warders acting under him. He discharged his humble duty faithfully and well   an earnest-minded man, a truthful witness,&quot; an efficient officer. He gave his evidence in sorrow, not in anger. It is upon such as he in the prisons, and in the police force, that the stress and strain fall in disturbances such as this.The Governor discharged a difficult and delicate duty with skill, - consider ateness, and success. I recommend that he be indemnified against all costs.The accusations against the Doctor are peculi-arly wanton and cruel.
STATEMENT OF IRISH-AMERICAN DELEGATES.ALLEGATIONS.(1) Hundreds ol men and women were con-fined under circumstances of the most si locking nature in the jails, particularly those in the larger cities.(2) Crossing the Irish Sea from Holyhead to Dunleary, we came upon the first evidence of the military occupation of Ireland. The vessels and wharves swarmed with soldiers, fully equipped for the field, going to and corning from Dublin.(3) When we arrived in Ireland we found soldiers everywhere. A careful investigation, made on the day before we left Ireland, showed that the Army of Occupation numbers consider-ably 100,000 men, to which accessions are being made daily. The troops are equipped with lorries, armoured cars, tanks, machine guns, bombing planes, light &apos;and heavy artillery; and in fact all of the engines of war lately employed against the Central Powers.(4) There are approximately 15,000 members of the Royal Irish Constabulary. The Con-stabulary is a branch of the Military Forces. They are armed with rifles, as well as small side-arms, engage in regular drill and field man-oeuvres. They are never residents of the dis-tricts which they occupy, and have quarters in regular Government Barracks.(5) Mountjoy Prison contained a large num-ber of political prisoners, many of them men of the highest character and standing.(6) The Governor of Mountjoy refused the delegates admission to visit the prison when made through the Municipal Authorities of the City of Dublin, but Sir John Irwin, Chairman of the Visiting Justices, who is in supreme authority of the jail, over-ruled the decision of the Governor and admitted the delegates.(7) The political prisoners were confined for the most part in groups, the majority of them being locked up in steel cages, built in the yards of the prison entirely outside of the buildings proper. These cages are exact duplicates of those used for wild animals in the larger Zoological Gardens, such as Lincoln Park and the Brenz in the United States.FACTS.(1) This allegation is absolutely without foun-dation.(2) On this date 176 men were demobilised and left Ireland. 65 men (loyal Irishmen) for demobilisation arrived in Ireland on the same day. No soldiers arrived at Kingstown as rein-forcements on that date.(3) The figures are grossly exaggerated. The equipment mentioned is normal in these days. As regards equipment, the troops in England are similarly equipped, as are also the troops of our Allies, including our American Allies.(4) The strength of the Royal Irish Constabu-lary is 9,682 men. It is not a branch of the Military Forces of the Crown, though armed with rifles and side-arms; it practices drill, but not field manoeuvres. The men are not natives of the district in which they serve; the unmar-ried members live in small police barracks, and the married men sometimes in private houses.(5) At the date of the visit of the delegates to Mountjoy Prison the total number of so:called &quot;political prisoners&quot; was 28 persons, consisting of one biscuit-maker, one candle-maker, one carpenter, one carter, one coachbuilder, one 1 cycle and motor dealer, one engine driver, one factory hand, four farmers, two fitters, two labourers, one mason, two journalists, one mes-senger, one newsvendor, one plater Js helper, one shop assistant, one storekeeper, one tailor, two University students, and one of no occupation.(6) The Chief Secretary had previously given orders, when the question was first put to him, that the delegates should not be admitted to Mountjoy Prison. But through &apos;a miscarriage of the order subsequently on the telephone a misunderstanding arose, and they were admitted. The Governor of the prison had no power to admit the delegates without the authority of the General Prisons Board. The Chairman of the Visiting Committee for the time being (who is not the supreme authority, as stated) happened to be present on the occasion of the visit of the delegates and accompanied the visitors, being under the impression that permission had been granted.(7) There is no foundation for this allegation. Each prisoner has a properly-equipped cell in the prison block, heated with hot-water pipes, lighted, and supplied with books. The prisoners take exercise in portions of the prison grounds, which are enclosed with iron railings instead of the customary high walls, but these enclosures in no way resemble cages in Zoological Gardens.B
449(8) Statements had been made that un-speakable outrages were being - committed against the persons of. these men and the most barbarous cruelties inflicted upon them. That they had been starved, beaten, confined in dark and noisome underground cells, otherwise mal-treated, and kept for days with their hands handcuffed behind their backs.(9) The delegates attempted to secure state-nients from the officers either confirming or denying the charges, but they were not permit-ted to talk to anyone inside the prison except the Governor. He stated that no such barbarities had been committed since he had taken charge of the Prison a week or two before. He refused to speak for any time prior to that. He at first denied that there were underground cells in the prison, but upon the delegates insisting, they were allowed entrance. They found a great number of cells underground, too narrow for human occupation, without beds or coverings for the prisoners, no ventilation, pitch dark and extremely cold, although the weather at the time was not severe. The delegates were in-formed that these cells were at times occupied by prisoners.The delegates had authentic information that a large number of political prisoners were taken out of the underground cells after they had de-manded admission on the previous night.(10) They found one of the political prisoners still in solitary confinement; he presented a pitiable spectacle. The miserable cell was cold and badly, ventilated. He was in an unkempt condition, highly nervous, palpably under-nourished, and had a wild glare in his eyes in-dicating an extremely dangerous mental state. He tried to speak to the delegates, but was quickly silenced by the warder.(11) The political prisoners in this jail, with-out exception, are men of the highest standing.Many of them, confined for months, have not been informed of the charge against them- All of them are denied the right of trial by jury. When charges are made often of the most trivial character bail is denied. They were all emaciated and appeared to be suffering from mal-nutrition.(8) Such statements are absolutely devoid of foundation. They are similar to the statements which were recklessly made in connection with the treatment of Sinn Fein prisoners in Belfast prison, where the Government appointed a Judicial Commission to investigate the charges thoroughly. The Judge found&apos;there was not a word of truth in these statements (see Preface).(9) There is no truth in the allegation that the delegates, during their visit to Mountjoy Prison, atempted to secure statements from officers. ,The cells referred to are the reception cells used for committals pending medical inspection, which are designedly isolated from the rest of the prison to avoid the risk of infection. They are not underground cells. These cells are of the ordinary description, have each a capacity of 828  cubic feet, fully equipped with beds, bedding, furniture, and utensils, and lighted with the usual-size windows.There were no political prisoners located in these cells on the night referred to; in fact, there were no prisoners of this class committed on the preceding day at all.(10) The prisoner referred to is William Sears, who is undergoing a sentence of close confine-ment imposed on him by the Visiting Justices appointed by the Dublin Corporation and other local bodies and not by the Irish Government. He was confined in a large, airy cell, 1,228 cubic feet capacity. The temperature of the cell was 55F. The window of the cell was 3ft. Bin., facing south-east. This prisoner has been re-eeiving special attention and diet. There was nothing whatever abnormal in his general con-dition. As to the statement that he was in an unkempt condition, he was enjoying the privi-lege of wearing his own clothes and the use of his own toilet requisites.(11) As regards the standing of these political prisoners, reference is requested to reply at No. 5.There is no truth in this statement. There is no prisoner sentenced in Ireland to-day without knowing the charge against him.All prisoners are received under warrant. In civil cases the warrant embodies the.charge. Trial by Jury takes place in the case of ordinary indictable offences. Bail is allowed in such cases either on application to the committing Justice, who is bound to grant bail in a very large number of cases, and has discretion in others, or on application to the Kings Bench Division; but these prisoners refused to enter into bail, and in many cases refused to recognise the authority of the Court before which they were brought. In cases of offences against the De-fence of the Bealm Regulations, trial is either by court martial or by-Magistrates in Courts of Summary Jurisdiction, as in the case of the rest of the United Kingdom under the Regulations. Bail can. be granted, and is usually offered.The prisoners were in a satisfactory state of health; there were no signs of mal-nutrition or emaciation. These prisoners have been on special and supplemented diet.
(12) As the delegates were leaving the prison they observed Pierce Beasley, one of the political prisoners, being hustled through the back door-way by a burly prison guard. . Beasley cried out  &quot; I want to call your attention to the fact that this brute who has me in charge is about to punish me for saying &apos; Long live the Republic&apos; &quot;The delegates immediately protested against the assault on Mr. Beasley, and the Governor, after a hurried whispered conversation with the guard, assured them that no punishment would be inflicted upon Beasley.(13) Upon the delegates return from the prison they were furnished with detailed statements of others who had been confined in the prison, ex-uosing the vilest attrocities committed against such prisoners.(12) This is a gross misrepresentation. Pierce Beasley, the prisoner referred to, was awaiting trial, charged with various offences under the De-fence of the Realm Regulations. He was cliurged, inter alia, with having in his possession, so that he might use it and the instructions there-in contained a document instructing persons in the method of doing injury to railways, telegraph wires and railway engines; instructions for the unlawful training of men in the use of rifles; and with having in. a speech applauded the conduct of certain desperadoes who forced their way into His Majesty &apos;s Prison at Cork, seriously assaulting and over-powering the Prison warders, and rescued from the prison a man named McNealis who was awaiting trial on a charge of having at-tempted to murder a Head Constable of Police in the city of Cork by deliberately firing at him with a revolver.The prisoner Beasley was not hustled by a burly or any other prison guard. As a matter of fact he was not being brought in to be awarded any punishment whatever but to he informed as to the date of his trial by Court Martial.The statement that the delegates protested against an assault on Pierce Beasley is untrue, and no assault whatever was committed on him.When the Chairman enquired as to whether Beasley would be punished for making a remark the Governor of the prison informed him that he would not, and that it was not for the purpose of being punished that he was being brought in.(13) The Irish Government have no knowledge of such statements and copies of them have not been furnished to the Government, but if any such statements were in fact furnished to the delegates they are utterly untrue. (See the Judge&apos;s Report in the Preface).(14) The delegates upon being informed that there was a large number of prisoners confined in a smaller prison in the town of Westport and that cruelties and barbarities were being practised upon them, endeavoured to visit Westport, but were prevented by the Military Authorities from entering.Many of the persons the delegates met in the vicinity corroborated the stories of brutal treat-ment to which prisoners in Westport Gaol were being subjected, the details being horrible beyond belief.(14) If any such information were given to the delegates it was pure invention. There is, in fact, no prison at Westport.(15) We announced our intention of visiting Westport. Shortly before the departure of our -train upon the following evening two policemen appeared at our apartments and handed us an unsigned typewritten letter notifying us that we would not be permitted to enter&apos;the town of Westport, the only reason given being that it &quot;was within a military area.&quot; We proceeded, nevertheless, to Westport.As we approach the town a company of soldiers met us about three miles out, ,and the ^Lieu-tenant announced in a surly tone that under no circumstances would we be permitted to enter. We demanded to see the Colonel, to whom we showed our passports, repeated the message of Mr. Lloyd George delivered through Sir William Wiseman, to the effect that he wanted us to visit all of Ireland, explained that we were con-ducting an investigation under the authority of the Prime Minister. We advised him that we understood that revolting conditions existed in Westport.   The Colonel, however, declared that(15) The Irish Government did not interfere with their arranged programme. The visit of the delegates to Westport did not form part of their original programme, and on their return to Dublin, when they decided, for provocative re&apos;asons, as they admit, to proceed to Westport, they were notified by the Chief Secretary that they would not be allowed to enter that district, which had been declared a Special Military Area following the brutal political murder of the local Resident Magistrate. Notwithstanding the noti-iication given to them, and in defiance of the Irish Government, the delegates attempted to enter the area, but were courteously informed by Colonel Owens, the Military Commandant, that he could not allow them to enter.There is no truth in the allegation that the Lieutenant, who first spoke Fo the delegates, addressed them in a surly tone ; they were treated with the greatest courtesy, but were informed that no person, not even a Minister of the Crown, was entitled to enter a Military Area without a Special
he would take the full responsibility of not complying Math the request of even so high a personage as the Prime Minister of England, though he stated that he was acting on orders from the Government officials in Dublin.(16) During our visits to Ireland we witnessed numerous assaults in public streets and high-ways with bayonets and clubbed rifles upon men and women known to be Republicans, or sus-pected of being in favour of a Republican form of government. Many of the outraged persons were men and women of exemplary character&apos; and occupying high positions in the business and professional life of the country.(17) Within the past few months at least ten citizens have been killed by soldiers and con-stables under circumstances which in a majority of the cases Coroners&apos; Juries found to be wilful murder under the laws of England; the last man having been murdered in this way less than one month ago.In all these cases the perpetrators of the crimes have gone unpunished.(18) Hundreds of men and women have been confined for months in the vilest prisons without any charges being preferred against them,(19) At least 5 have died at the result of atroci-ties perpetrated upon them while in prison, the post mortem examination in some of the cases dis-closing marks of violence upon the bodies of the victims.(20) Prisoners are confined in narrow cells with hands handcuffed behind them day and night. In this condition they are fed by jail attendants. They are permitted no opportunity of answering calls of nature, and are compelled ,to lie in their clothing befouled by human excrement for days at a time.(21) Persons are confined in cells which are not large enough for one man. They are not pro-vided with beds or bunks of any kind but are com-pelled to sleep upon the bare floors.   There arePermit. The Passports which the delegates had did not entitle them to enter.Owing to the conduct of the delegates in other parts of Ireland, and to the condition of the Westport Area, the Irish Government was un-able to undertake the responsibility for the con-sequences which would certainly have followed.(10) This is utterly untrue. The Military or Police never use their rifles or bayonets except in defence of their barracks or in necessary self-defence, or when it is absolutely necessary to do* so to quell a serious disturbance of the peace.(17) This &quot;is not true. In April last there were-two cases; in one case armed Sinn Peiners at-tacked and fired on a police guard in charge of a Sinn Fein prisoner in Limerick Union Hospital; they murdered one policeman and seriously wounded another. The Sinn Fein prisoner was rescued from the guard but was subsequently found dead as a result of a bullet wound. The&apos; local Coroner&apos;s Jury found that he died as the result of a shot fired wilfully by one or other of two policemen; but the verdict was manifestly an unjust one, and no blame whatever could at-tach to the police in the circumstances.In the second case at Ring, county Waterfordr where they had to defend themselves in a hostile-crowd, a man kicked violently at the Police Bar-racks at night. The constable on guard the only occupant of the barracks at the time believ-ing that this was a prelude to an attack on the barracks, fired through the barrack door hitting the man who was kicking at the door and who subsequently died.The Attorney-General for Ireland, having fully considered the case, advised that it was not one in which there should be a prosecution.Beyond these cases there is no foundation for the allegation. The Military Authorities report that, within the past twelve months, there has been no case in which a Coroner&apos;s Jury brought&apos; in a verdict of manslaughter against a soldier for killing a civilian, and the police authorities report to the same effect as regards their Force.(18) The term &apos;&apos; vilest &quot; is, of course, wholly un-warrantable. For the general answer see 32. Meantime it is well to point out that the prisons referred to are part of the general prison system of the country and that the prisoners referred to, unlike ordinary prisoners, received special ameliorative treatment.(19) There is no truth in this allegation; no death resulted in any such circumstances.(20 &amp; 21) There is absolutely no foundation for these allegations. They are a repetition of the charges already investigated and reported upon by the Right Hon. Mr. Justice Dodd sitting as a Special Commissioner appointed under the autho-rity of a special Act of Parliament. (See Pre-face).
no toilet facilities or receptacle to contain the human offal which necessarily accumulates upon the floors where men are compelled to sleep in the filth night after night.(22). The food is insufficient and unwhole-some. Prisoners men and women are co;m-pelled to live for days upon water and poorly-baked, sour and stale bread.(28) Hundreds of men and women have been discharged from jail with impaired constitutions, and are in many cases incurable invalids as a result of their treatment.(24) During the past winter and spring streams of ice-cold water were poured upon men confined in jail, and they were compelled to lie all night on cold floors in unheated cells in their wet clothing. Many of them -were afterwards re-moved to outside hospitals suffering from pneu-monia.(25) Police and soldiers are habitually per-mitted to enter the cells where political prisoners are confined and to beat them with their clubs.(22) This is wholly untrue. The scale diet in force in Irish prisons for men and women is generous, varied and nutritious, and is changed or added to by the medical officer for medical reasons. As has been stated, they receive ameliorative treatment unless they misbehave.(23) Tliis is a gross exaggeration, The health of prisoners is closely watched by the medical officers of prisons. No such case as is alleged is known. Prisoners have frequently been re-leased on medical grounds.(24) These statements are untrue. The fol-lowing constitutes the only pretext for making such a charge:On one occasion, in February last, four prison-ers in Mountjoy Prison, after exercise, instead of returning to their cells, climbed up to a ledge upon the roof of one of the wings of the prison. They could not be reached or induced to come down, and after being repeatedly cautioned that if they did not come down the hose would be used; it became necessary to get them down to use it. They did come down. The incident occurred in the presence of Visiting Justices.Changes of clothing were at once provided for these prisoners. Two of them availed of the change of clothing. The Medical Officer took charge of the other two, and had one removed to hospital and the other to bed. No illness resulted to any of the prisoners. (See also Preface).(25) These statements are untrue.(26) Solitary confinement in most horrible form is generally practised. Numbers of prisoners have been taken directly from the jails to insane asylums, rendered maniacs by their treatment.(27) Large bodies of political prisoners, in cer-tain jails, have been kept without any food what-ever for days at a time.(28) The right of privacy no longer exists in Ire-land. The homes of the people are constantly being invaded by armed men, and the occupants, including delicate women and young children cruellv beaten and otherwise maltreated.(29) The children of suspected Republicans, many of tender years, are kidnapped, and their parents kept in ignorance of their whereabouts for weeks.(26) This statement is absolutely untrue.(27) This statement is absolutely untrue.(28) The privacy of homes is never invaded in the manner stated, but private homes have often to be searched in pursuit of persons evading arrest on charges of murder and other serious crimes, for explosives, for concealed arms, and other contraventions of the Defence of the Realm Regulations. The charge of maltreatment of delicate women and children is now made, for the first time, and is, of course, unfounded.(29) The only foundation for this allegation is that in the present year it was found necessary, for the safety of three young boys and one young man, to put them temporarily under the care of the Police for their own protection. Their parents were not in ignorance of their where-abouts.&apos; That there was ground for this action is evidenced by the fact that in the districts from which, they came threats were made in proclarna-tions of the Sinn Feiners that anybody who was likely to give information about their outrages would be murdered.(30) Women and children of refinement and (30) This allegation, which was made against respectability are arrested without warrant, and   England as well as Ireland, is quite untrue. The
444in company of rough and brutal soldiers, trans-ported to distant parts of Ireland and England, where they are confined in jail with the lowest prostitutes, some of whom are suffering from vile disease, and are compelled to use the same toilet facilities, and thus expose themselves to the danger of infection.(31) The right of private property no longer exists in Ireland. Places of business of Republicans are invaded by soldiers and constables, fixtures destroyed and property confiscated Avithout com-pensation. In many cases the owners of such business and property are utterly impoverished.system of classification in prisons and the care and attention of the Medical Officers and Ma-trons preclude such happenings as are alleged.(32) Heads of hundreds of families have been jailed or deported, leaving dependent women and children without means of subsistence and rendered objects of public charity.(31) Articles kept or used for seditious purposes are, Avhere necessary, seized and confiscated. They are generally of little intrinsic value. Printing plants used for seditious and pro-German purposes have been removed. In most cases the proprietors have received frequent warnings before such removals, and it has only been where they persist in their misconduct that this course has been resorted to. In many cases even after removal where the proprietors have given undertakings that they would not in future use their printing plants for seditious and pro-German purposes, the plant has been restored.(32) After the rebellion of Easter, 1916, a large number of persons who had taken part in the rebellion and surrendered to the Military, as well as a large number of persons throughout the country who were believed to have been in com-plicity with the rebels, were arrested and deported to England. Many of these persons were soon after discharged by the Military Authorities, but about 700 men were detained in England in an Internment Camp under the authority of the Defence of the Realm Eegulations. Some of these men were, from time to time, discharged on entering into an undertaking to be of good behaviour, and all the remaining internees were released from confinement shortly before Christinas 1916.In February, 1917, a small number of persons Avas deported to England owing to their seditious and pro-German activities, but these persons Avere not interned in England; they Avere merely required to live in specified localities, and the Irish Government bore the cost of their main-tenance.In May, 1918, it also became necessary to arrest and intern in England, for the same reasons, a considerable number of persons, many of Avhom had been convicted of participation in the rebellion of 1916, and sentenced to terms of penal servitude, from Avhich they were released by an amnesty granted by the King in June, 19.17.It is absolutely untrue to say that the women and children dependent upon these persons were left without means of sustenance, inasmuch as GoA^ernment provided an allowance in any case in which it Avas found to be necessary.(33) Men and Avomen,&apos; on mere suspicion of (33) This is a pure fabrication, having Republican sympathies, are being taken from their homes and arrested upon the streets and highways of Ireland, deported to England, or confined in jails in remote places, Avhile their distracted families are kept, sometimes for- many months, in ignorance of their whereabouts.Many prominent leaders upon Avhom these atrocities have been practised are laAvyers, among them being John Hanrahan, Edmund Duggan and George Nicolls.(34) We Avitnessed&apos; Avhile in Ireland a brutal (34) This allegation refers to the occasion on and unprovoked assault by an English Colonel which the delegates were courteously informed and a croAvd of soldiers on the person of Professor by Colonel Owens, the Military Commandant at John McNeill. Westport, that he could not permit them to enterv the Westport Military Area.  No assault whatever was committed on the person of Professor John
McNeill. The latter tried to force his way past the military guard, but of course was not allowed to do so. No violence was offered to him, and the statement of the delegates that they witnessed a brutal and unprovoked assault can only be described as a deliberate and wicked falsehood.(35) If England ever had an educational system in Ireland it has completely broken clown. The Irish People are taxed more for the support of the Police and Constabulary although the country is practically crimeless in the ordinary sense-than they are for the maintenance of the whole educational system of Ireland, including the up-keep of the National University and Trinity College, as well as all the primary and other schools in the land.School Teachers in the Primary Schools are paid as low as four dollars per week.(36) No system of hygiene or sanitation has been installed.&apos; (35) The Irish system of Primary Education is wholly Irish so much so that there is no Educa-tion rate in Ireland (except for Technical Edu-cation, with a maximum of 2d. in the  ) and the whole cost of Irish Primary Education falls on Votes of Parliament i.e. the United Kingdom Taxpayer. In Engfemd and Scotland some 50 per cent, of the cost of education falls on the local ratepayers : the Irish ratepayer pays nothing. Though, the cost of the system falls wholly on the United Kingdom taxpayer the State is not able to appoint a single teacher (except in the Model Schools) ;. the appointment of teachers rests solely with the local manager i.e., with individual Irishmen.The cost of Irish Education to the United Kingdom taxpayer, as shown by the Votes of Parliament, is for 1919-20  3,389,234. The Votes for Irish Police, 1919-20, amount to  2,388,267.As regards the salaries of School Teachers a man, on becoming a National School Teacher re-corves  78 per annum plus war bonus of  60 per annum  138 per annum or 53s. per week. A woman&apos;s initial salary is  64 per annum plus war bonus  50 per annum  134 per annum, or 44s. per week. These are the lowest initial salaries of the recognised National Teachers (some 13,000 in number). They advance, of course, to much higher salaries, and most of them receive capi-tation payments and fees of various kinds, in addition. Junior Assistant Mistresses (a class of unqualified teachers employed in schools which do not warrant the employment of certificated teachers) receive  40 (rising to  52) plus war bonus  44 per annum, or an initial pay of  84 per annum (32s. per week). There is an obsolescent-lescent class called Workmistresses who still do part-time work in some few schools. These get about  13 per annum phis war bonus of  19 per annum or over 12s. per week. They are only some 50 in number, whereas the certificated Teachers and Junior Assistant Mistresses are about 16,000. It is misleading, therefore, to say that &quot; School Teachers in the Primary Schools &quot; are paid as low as four dollars a week.(36) This is quite untrue. The system of hygiene and sanitation vests in the elected repre-sentatives of the people all necessary powers to remedy any defects in Public Health. Under the provisions of the Public Health Acts Loans are made by the State for all works of improve-ment which the Local Authorities deem to be necessary for the preservation of health within their districts.(37) The teeth of practically all the children are in decay, and respiration and throat troubles exist to an alarming degree.(37) The Irish children suffer less from defective teeth than the children in most other parts of the United Kingdom. In the agricultural dis-tricts the children are notorious for their good teeth. The Government grant is available to cover half the cost of the dental treatment of school children.(38) Lack of decent clothing and under-nourish-ment is keeping thousands of children out of school.(38) This statement is quite untrue. Ireland is an agricultural country and the people have profited by the War. There have been practi-cally no food restrictions, and for these reasons it is believed that the children have been better fed than those in other parts of Europe.  The
statement that thousands have been kept from school for want of nourishment is,a fabrication. As a matter of fact Local Authorities have power to feed school children from the Rates, if they think it necessary to do so, and when it is done the Government pay half the cost. In the larger towns, the Urban Authorities avail them-selves of this Act.(39) In the City of Dublin alone there are 20,000 families on an average of 5 to each family living in one room tenements. Infant mortality is appalling.    Destitution and hunger is rife.Municipal bodies and private persons are attempting to extend relief, but all such activities must have the sanction of the English Govern-ment, which is difficult if not impossible to obtain.(39) In Dublin the Corporation have done all in their power to meet the Housing difficulty. The Corporation have already built 2,000 new houses and they have in hand schemes for an additional number. Every assistance and en-encouragement has been given to them by the Local Government Board to extend their operation. Infant mortality in Dublin has undoubtedly been high, but the mortality in some of the manu-facturing cities in England has been equally high. Government Funds have been available for Maternity Benefit and Child Welfare, and the Corporation ,are taking a most active interest in the matter, and have received half the outlay on their schemes from Government Funds. The statement that hunger is rife is not based on facts. The relief of the poor is the one particular matter upon which the Local Authorities have full power to act without the Local Government Board&apos;s sanction, as the Board are expressly prohibited by Statute from interfering with regard to relief. Outside the Statutory relief, there are various agencies, public and private, many of . them subsidised from Government Funds. Separation allowances to dependents of soldiers and Old Age Pensions have led to the circulation of many millions sterling among the poor. Many vague general charges of indifference and neglect have, it is true, been preferred from time to time against Irish Local Authorities constituted under the Local Government Act, but the Local Government Board have always held and still hold, that in regard to the ad-ministration of the matters referred to in the statement of the American Delegates the Local Authorities have not failed to fulfil their responsibilities.(40) The much vaunted Land Laws have not appreciably aided in decreasing poverty in the agricultural districts.Leaving out of the question the manifold defects and hardships in the operations of the law, all the farmer should gain by the ownership of his land is taken away from him by unjust taxation.When the first Land Law Act was passed the direct per capita tax in Ireland was about six dollars per head. At the present time the direct taxation, imposed by British Law, amounts annually to the enormous sum of 45 dollars. The indirect taxation of the people cannot be accurately estimated, but is higher proportionately than in any other country in the world.(40) The condition of the agricultural districts in Ireland has improved very considerably since the introduction of the Land Law Acts which gave the tenant security of tenure in his holding, and enabled him to have a fair-rent fixed, and the Land Pur-chase Acts which have enabled him to purchase his holding from his landlord on easy terms by purchase money advanced by the State repayable by a terminable annuity containing interest and principal, the annuities showing a considerable reduction on the former rental generally averaging from 27 per cent, to 30 per cent. Over 400,000 tenants have purchased their holdings or signed purchase agreements to do so, representing advances of over  122,000,000, of which over  100,000,000 have been already paid. These figures include purchase and resale of estates by the Congested Districts Board through the Land and Estates Commissioners. In the proceedings for sale under the Land Purchase Acts since 1903 the Estates Commissioners have already acquired over 325,000 acres of untenanted land which has been utilized in the enlargement of existing holdings or in the creation of new holdings, and considerable improvements have been effected on farm buildings,, roads, and drainage. In addition there has been much improvement in the country through the operation of the Labourers Acts under which many thousands of cottages with plots attached are
(41) The old age curse of absentee landlordism still cuts deeply into the uneconomic heart of Ireland. Hundreds of thousands of its more fertile acres are owned by foreigners. As quickly as the rich crops are garnered they are taken out of the country.England has absolutely cut off Ireland from the outside commerce of the world ; allows no ships to come trans-Atlantic to her ports, and thus controls the prices of the necessaries of life.provided for rural labourers. Since 1906 the operations of these Acts have been considerably extended. MSince 1881 the improvement of thb peasantry both as regards manner of living, dress, and housing accommodation has been most remarkable. This general improvement is also evidenced by the following statistics : Post  Office   Savings ) Bank Irish Deposits, J1881. 1,645,0001914.  &apos;13,303,000 decreased to 11,264,000 on31 Dec, 1917Irish Banks Deposits  28,289,000    61,955,000 and Private Balances. increased to91,361,000 on31 Dec, 1917.

Value ....  72,270,656    87,142,485(41) Over two-thirds of the country has come under the operation of the Land Purchase Acts, the larger Landlords, among whom were the absentees, having already sold their estates to their Tenants, and a large proportion of the Stock issued for the purpose is held in Ireland, and the interest thereon comes back to this country.As to rich crops being taken out of the c ountry, if they are so taken it is on sale by the farmers who have raised them at direct profit to themselves.Irish Ports are free to all the ships of the world and there is no restriction whatever with regard to trans-Atlantic traffic.(42) Ireland has the best organized and most coherent labour movement in the world. It is being thwarted and suppressed by the Army and Constabularv.(42) It is untrue to allege that the Labour movement in Ireland is being thwarted or suppressed or at all interfered with by the Army and Constabularv.(43) Wages of unskilled workers are below a line which means to them hunger, cold, and privation. The wages of skilled labour is far below the minimum for decent existence.(44) In many of the larger cities and towns the Trade Unions have a hundred per cent, organization.We met and intervieAved all of the National Leaders of Labour. The Heads of the National Irish Labour Party, which is in control of the situation, are, without exception, ardent republic-cans, fully alive to their rights and demanding self-determination for Ireland. They have all been the innocent victims of atrocities against their own persons, such as are enumerated herein, in the jails of Ireland and England.(45) They are attempting to work along traditional Trade Union lines, but if relief is not extended to Ireland, and quickly, many of them declare that in sheer defence of their own lives they must set up local Soviet Governments and refuse longer to produce wealth for their oppressors.(43) This is untrue. The wages of skilled labour compare favourably with those obtaining in com-parable districts of Great Britain. The wages of unskilled workers, particularly of agricultural labourers, have been more than doubled since the war. A body composed of representative Irishmen selected to represent the different interests affected fixes the wages.(44) Some of the Leaders of Labour in Ireland appear to be in sympathy with the Sinn Fein Party, but it is untrue to suggest that all the Trades Union Leaders are. A large number of them, on the contrary, carry on their Trades Union activities successfully on the traditional Trades Union lines.Neither the Heads of the Labour movements nor any other persons have been victims of atrocities as is alleged.(45) There appears to be a section which approves the idea of Soviet Government, but this is a movement which is not common to Ireland.d
(46) There is a military organization of approxi-mately 200,000 men of fighting age, poorly equipped as to arms and without artillery. They appear to be well officered, and seemingly main-tain a perfect organization, engaging in daily drills and frequent manoeuvres. Upon all sides may be heard declarations that they are ready to fight and die for the right of self-determination no matter how great the odds against them may be.Guerilla warfare of the character which usually precedes major conflicts is now going on in Ireland. Almost every day there are fights between small detachments of the Army of Occupation and groups of Republican Volunteers. One day the British soldiers prevail, with the result that citizens are killed. On another day, perhaps, the Republican Volunteers are successful with the result that soldiers are killed. Frequently the British soldiery wound and capture the Volun-teers, a.nd in turn the Volunteers kill or wound the soldiers and re-take the prisoners.(47) With a ferocity unparalleled even in the history of modern warfare, within the past few days men and women have been shot down in the streets of Dublin.(46) This statement, inspired by the leaders of Sinn Fein, merely emphasises the necessity for continued vigilance on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government. There is, it is true, a quasi-military organization which calls itself the Irish Republican Army, and it is known that this organization secretly plots murders and outrages against persons and property in many parts of Ireland.There&apos; is no such thing as guerilla warfare in Ireland. But if the Delegates mean that mem-bers of the so-called Irish Republican Army in a cowardly and dastardly manner assassinate un-suspecting policemen or other loyal persons it is only too certain that &quot; guerilla warfare &quot; in this sense exists. There have been instances in which members of the so-called Irish republic-can Army have lost their lives in consequence of the explosion of the substances which they had stored for blowing up police barracks and other buildings. The suggestion that there is daily &quot; warfare &quot; between His Majesty&apos;s troops and the Volunteers of the so-called Irish Republic is grotesque.(47) Unfortunately four policemen and a girl have been so shot in the streets of Dublin within the past few days by a number of Sinn Feiners who rescued a Sinn Fein prisoner from the Police. The police fired no shots.Chief Secretary s Office, Dublin Castle,Uth June, 1919.12987. (73). 3. 200. 6. 1919. A.T. &amp; Co., Ltd.
