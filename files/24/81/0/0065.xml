From Viceroy, 11th June 1919.(Received 12th, .11 a.m.)859 3. Clear the line. Secret. Following from Roos-Keppel, dated 10th June : &quot; (R.) lleilly wires from OhitralBrigadier Asmar lias written to me friendly-letter stating he has ordered his troops to cease hostilities in compliance with Amanullah&apos;s orders. To-day&apos;s report states that Afghan regulars withdrew towards Asmar, leaving only 60 ac Birshallat and 40 at Nari to watch and [corrupt group] tribesmen are dispersing to their homes.&apos;&quot; Second. (? Political Assistant), Malakand, telegraphs 1.0th instant, 10 hours :  1 Sandakai xMullah was reported yesterday to have returned to Upper Swat from Kana. To-day, definite information lie has raised a following among Aziz Khel and Shami-zais, and is starting (? down with) some standards. I believe this is due to the fresh, letter from Haji Turangzai threatening to ex-communicate him unless he raises actual trouble. Mian (? emissary) say(s) that he will do his best to stop Mullah, but [corrupt group] support.&apos;&quot;Following from Baluchistan, dated 10th June: &apos; Letters from Jacobs up to 7th June have got through. Gist is that immediate neighbourhood of Fort Sandeman is quiet. Kepip post not fallen, but being invested by about 200 Sherannis. Whole militia except about 400 have deserted. No further mention of Sulaimen Khel Lashkar, but Jacobs frars Wazirs may use deserted post of Mir Ali Khel as advanced supply depot for future attacks on Fort Sandeman. Fiimis telegraphs from Kila Saifulla that tribes round Mina Bazar have risen. I have sent him to [place name corrupt] to verify. (? Strong force of) deserters from Dhansar passed through outskirts of Musa Khel into their own hills, and [corrupt group] surrender of jointed field guns and rifles to local authorities. Musa Khel [corrupt group] quiet in spite of incitement from Sherannis and Chandhris with reinforcements arriving there to-day. Most serious feature of situation is dispersal of some 1,200 deserters from Zhob Militia [corrupt group] country, some actively opposed to us and some merely spreading alarming reports.&quot; &apos; Advance of [corrupt name] and to-day&apos;s visit of BrunskiJl to Fort Sandeman should steady whole countryside.&apos; &quot;
