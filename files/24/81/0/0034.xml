This Document is the Property of His Britannic &apos;Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.  June 1919.confidential.EXTRADITION AND FUGITIVE OFFENDERS.^ I CIRCULATE to the War Cabinet copies of a Draft Bill to amend the Law relating to Extradition and Fugitive Offenders which it is desired to introduce in Parliament during the present Session. The objects of -the Bill are indicated in the accompanying Memorandum. This is a matter which has been under consideration for a considerable time, and it is thought desirable that legislation should not be further delayed. I trust, therefore, that sanction will be given for the Bill to be introduced this Session.MILNER.Downing Street, June 4, 1919.[2046]
Extradition and Fugitive OffendersBill.MEMORANDUM.The main object of this Bill is to amend the Extradition law in its application to the self-governing dominions and other British Possessions. Incidentally it effects a few amendments of the law relating to extradition and fugitive offenders which, experience of the working of the Acts has suggested.Clause 1.The object of this clause is to enable offences which have local importance to be made extraditable as respects the dominion or colony where they are of importance.Clause 2.Section 18 of the Extradition Act, 1870, enacts that where legislation has been passed by a British Possession for the surrender of fugitive criminals in the possession, the Order in Council applying the Extradition Act in the case of any foreign state may provide one or two alternatives: (1) It may suspend the operation of the Extradition Act within the possession so far as it relates to the foreign state in question and so long as the local law remains in force:(2) It may direct that the local law. shall have effect in the possession with or without modification as if it were part of the Extradition Act.The first alternative has never been acted on in the case of colonies not possessing responsible government, and it is not proposed to depart from this policy. - As regards self-governing dominions it has at present been acted on only in &quot;the case of Canada.It is proposed by this clause to confine the first alternative to the self-governing dominions; and where this alternative is adopted in the case of a self-governing dominion, further to provide not only that the Imperial Act shall be suspended but also that the local Act shall have extra-territorial validity and20-1
be recognised and given effect to throughout His Majesty&apos;s dominions and on the high seas.As respects colonies not possessing responsible government the second alternative will become the sole method of procedure.Clause 3.(1) Warrants are sometimes issued to ensure the arrest of an accused immediately on his arrival in this country.(3) Evidence on oath is frequently taken in the absence of an accused for the purpose of supporting an application for his extradition.The legality of these practices is open to doubt and the object of this clause is to remove the doubt.It is to be noticed that the Eugitive Offenders Act, 1881, expressly provides by section 29 that a magistrate may take depositions for the purpose of that Act in the absence of the accused, and by section 4 of that Act a warrant may be issued for the arrest of a fugitive who is in or on his way to the part of His Majesty&apos;s dominions in which the warrant is to he issued.Clause 4By section 11 of the Extradition Act, the accused cannot be surrendered before the expiration of fifteen days from his committal for surrender. If the accused does not wish to be detained in this country for the whole of the fifteen days and has no intention of applying for a writ of habeas corpus, there seems no reason why he should necessarily be kept for fifteen days. This clause, therefore, authorises his surrender before the expiration of the fifteen days if he gives his consent.Clause 5.The forms prescribed by the Act of 1870, are not very convenient. The form of surrender warrant in particular is not applicable to the case of officers sent by a foreign govern-ment to take an accused into custody while he is still within British jurisdiction. There should also he a form of order prescribed in the case of a police magistrate proceeding in the case of a fugitive arrested before the formal application for his surrender has been made.
By this clause it is therefore proposed to enable forms to he prescribed either in substitution for or in addition to the existing forms.Clause 6.This clause makes provision with respect to the date of the surrender of fugitives arrested under the Fugitive Offenders Act, similar to that made by clause 4, with respect to those arrested under the Extradition Acts.
