document IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJKSTYIS GOvTOmJt.)S C R E T.T, 7441138WAR CA3IKET.OONTIFCJANCIS OF MRGEHCY LEGISLATION.Copy^ of; a letter......frpm^the.....First.......Lord.........of.......the.....AdmiraltyYtfTiie&quot;President &quot;of the Board of Education.The Admiralty, .Whitehall, S.W.I. 4th June, 1919.My \dear Fisher,I .have just been rending a report of the meeting of your Committee on Home Affairs, of Friday, the 23rd &quot;May, (H.A.C.29. Minute 1.).I see that the Committee decided, in paragraph 3, that special legislation should be applied to Ireland in connection with the Defence of the Realm Regulations.   I am only troubling you with this note to ask whether you have fully considered the effect of legislating separately for Ireland as compared with the rest of the United Kingdom.   My experience of Irish--Government, extending .as it does for some 30 years, has impressed me with&apos;the undesirability of legislating separately -ately for Ireland in a punitive form,&apos;  It gives the opponents -  of law and order a very effective, cry, and&apos; is, I think certain to raise fierce and difficult opposition in Parliament;   and personally I should have been glad if it&apos; were possible to make proposals which-would apply to the whole of the United Kingdom if the law is,just, and if it is&apos; properly administered, no 3 a:-;?-- abiding citizen has. any reason to fear it.   The much abused..Crimea Act is to be&quot;found, as regards some of its most severe- provisions, in tho&apos; ordinary law of Scotland - and- yet the fact that; it is passed specially for Ireland gives a&apos; force to the opposition.which I do not think it would&quot;otherwise possess.. Please do not trouble to answer this;   I only ask for your consideration of my views.Yours very sincerely,The Right Son, &quot;(Signed)   WALT75R II. l01tg.H.A,L.li her, M.P.,*      Board of Education, Whitehall,
