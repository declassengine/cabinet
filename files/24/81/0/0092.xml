Secret;   Following is translation &quot;&apos;of letterfi&apos;om Annulla to Viceroy,&apos; No. 6; dated 1 lth Jane,&quot;received yesterday in Peshawar * &quot; May it he&apos; known to&apos; his illustriotrS&apos; Excellency my friend the Governor-Genernl of India, of the great Goyern-ment of Great Britain.   1. have&apos; received &apos;ttie friendly lettet: of my gracious, and kind friend dated -1th iiamzan 1.337 tlijra,&apos;corresponding, io 3rd Tune 1911), regarding discussion of peace, and containing lenient terms of cessation of hostilities, desiring, to avoid further useless bloodshed, and him who reposes.in the tomb of martyrdom, His7 Majesty Siraj-uI-Millat-wad-din, my illustrious father, whom&apos; God has taken into His mercy.and who was in friendly alliance with the British Government for many years.&apos;&apos; We are impressed with natural peace-loving inclinations of Great British nation whose high functionaries have honourably made this the principle of their diplomacy in&apos; other places of the world.   And we are grateful for expressioil of sincere friendly&apos; regard and esteem towards sublime /Afghan Government.Ton have, by alluding to events mentioned &quot;in previous&apos; letters, pointed out our misunderstanding of,the temper and power of &quot;the exalted British Government&apos;.&apos; My kind friend I consider a repetition of matters previously discussed is only to&apos; prolong uselessly a subject which is far from object in vievv. I refer to your expressions of. certainty and to passionate eulogy of unlimited resources of British Government, and to hint at the internal power of the sublime Government of Afghanistan, which,&apos; notwithstanding its defects of organisation, has repeatedly been a cause&apos;of desthtc-tion and ruin of Foreign Powers on its. sacred soil, and to qur alluding to the fact that firstly the Islamite Afghan nation really look upon fight with non-Muslim nation&apos; as a cause of revival&apos;of. its existence and as a means of its awakening notwithstanding&apos; its terrible damages and, the probability of numerous losses and/injuries; secondly, that it is in the Muslim nature of Afghans to prefer visible death, to subordination to&apos; a Foreign Power and to consider it&apos; perpetual life, and thirdly that the&apos;spirit.of&quot; freedom and of natural individuality and national liberty, with, its wonderful &quot;arid&apos; surprising&quot; world-wide electric&apos; and magnetic power inspiring peace&apos;; has caused the withered heart of the depressed classes of humanity to expand and blossom In every part of the world, and has by an extraordinary force brought into being conferences loving peace and equality, and has nearly brought&apos; to. its death-agony oppression and domination among different nations.We shall, therefore, leave these matters and turn to real object, in view which is conclusion of peace and cessation of hostilities between exalted Government of Afghanistan and Great Britain, Regarding this you have made certain impossible demands such as removal of the Afghan troops to a distance of 20 miles from British troops and. the free movements in the air of British aeroplanes over Afghan territory without any hindrance by the people, as well as an undertaking by the Afghan Government for the protection of aeroplanes in their country. Your overlooking of points so manifest and apparent is a matter for surprise for the only definition of military forces of sublime Afghan Government is that the military and civil forces of Afghanistan are identical. Plow then is it possible to move thousands and thousands of individuals and tribal people from their villages and winter-camping grounds in places opposite British lines ? I overlook ,those matters also which are impossible to accomplish and devote attention to possible and correct forms of armistice worthy of dignity of honoured and exalted governments. The essential object of the armistice is the suspension of hostilities by both sides for the discussion and settlement of peace. Nothing more than, cessation of hostilities and peace (? with its) inevitable results are required. That, has already taken place as communicated in my letter dated 27th Shaban 1.337 Hijra, corresponding to 28th May 1919, to my honourable friend. The best way to secure a discussion of peace with due consideration to honour of both parties is that troops of both Governments should remain in their present positions and enjoy mutual respect, until settlement of terms of peace. With regard to aeroplanes it is evident that their movements in the air in our exalted dominions is an illegal violation and interference, for the feelings of our nation who do not have aeroplanes are bitterly excited by seeing your aeroplanes. In every house and with every man are arms, rifles and ammunition, and it is impossible to restrain people even if we wish.   Moreover, it is possible owing to a change in the attitude of
friendship between two Governments an ignorant mischievous or designing person may tiro at them, thus leading to a rupture in the friendship and the postponement of peace between two Governments, the consequences of which will, not be advantageous but injurious to the two Governments. In my previous, Despatch I mentioned Landi Kotal or Peshawar as the meeting place of officers. of two Governments appointed for the conclusion of peace. Now yon, have..:in your letter, for certain reasons, perhaps, fixed on Hawal Pindi. as. a. suitable place of meeting. We also in order to secure your pleasure and to safeguard dignity and honour of illustrious British&apos; Government agree - with it. We have selected and appointed following officers for the discussion and arguiiiei.it of the terms of peace and the establishment of friendship between two Governments. They will, please God, be ready to start for Rawal Pindi on 27th June. I do licit, hesitate to mention here that we must not fail to keep in view the advantage of friendship and avoidance of hostilities between two Governments, particularly at a time .\vljen.such critical circumstances have arisen in Asia and Europe for our old friend the British Government. Your Excellency will see signal proof of my good intentions in my (? receiving) your terms of armistice in a reasonable manner. If Your Excellency will overlook past you will see a (V.suitable) future for both parties in the establish-ment of friendly relations between two Governments, Its advantageous results might then be mentioned by our selected representatives in course of discussion and coui-munication: (1) Our exalted and honoured brother, Ali Ahmad Khan, Commissary fpr Home Affairs, President of Peace Delegates. (2) Civil. General Sardar Muhammad us Khan,   (o) Ghulam Muhammad Khan, Commissary forCommerce,    (4) Civil.    Colonel Abdu;  Aziz. Khan, former envoy of; Afghan Government at the Court of the Government of India,   (5) Muhammad Raiiq Khan IJlmiqubilah, Superintendent of Correspondence, - (6) Doctor Abdul Ghaui , sidar Narwallafin, Chief of -Departments; - (;7) Civil.Colonel Nira Das, Sarda-aftar-i-wajuhat, head of Tax Department, (8) Abdul IIadi Khan, Chief Clerk. (0) Civil. Colonel Mirza Ghulam Muhammad Khan, Mir Munshi, Foreign Department. I hope Your Excellency will appoint representatives of your Government for management and settlement of the question by the time of arrival of said officers at Rawalpindi.&apos; For the rest, may the days of your honour and prosperity eudure for ever. Dated 11th June. Signed, Amir Ainanulla. Comments follow. - ...
