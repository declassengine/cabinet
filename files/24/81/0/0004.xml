SCeS.J    For the information of Members of the Board. 11^mm^^moikno^ of matters of naval merest.    nq*24.^ -FoV the week ended 51st May 19.19.BALTIC.S.N.O., Baltic, reported on 31st May that a Bolshevik battle-ehip and four small .craft had come to the edge of the minefield and had engaged the British force, and that an aeroplane had dropped bombs.     The fire is said to have been accurate and disciplined, and it is thought that the Germans are assisting. The engagement lasted 40 minutc3 and H.M.S. &quot;Walker&quot; was hit, but thore was no important material damage and no casualties.     One Bolshevik ship was damaged.The Bolsheviks have laid a short line of mines from position 2-J- miles 3200 from Dolgoi Nos in direction 330o.A sixth submarine has left for the Baltic to join the others at Reval.On 24th May the Oiler &quot;War Expert&quot; was, mined in Lat. 58^ 28&apos;N. Long, 21023&apos; E., while on passage from Libau to Reval, but reached Reval in safety.     &apos;J!he position is three miles off the track given on the charts.      The throe Paddle Mine Sweepers are being employed in searching the route.The following policy in regard to the Baltic States has now been sanctioned(a) Germans to remain in Latvia.and Lithuania, pending order from Allies, but to be replaced by local forces as soon asf*      possible..;(b) Allied Military Mission under British General (Sir Hubert Gough) to be organised with Headquarters at Libau and to advise Governments of Esthonia, Latvia, and Lithuania on organisation, equipment, and training of local and volunteer forces,, and generally an best means of defence against Bolsheviks and exclusion of Germans.(g)   Volunteer forces to be raised in Scandinavia and Finland.(d) Food supplies, clothing, arms, and munitions, etc. to be supplied by Allies.(e) Political and economic missions to see what collateral securities can &quot;be obtained locally to cover credit.     ,Esthonia.Arrangements have been made for the jevictualling of Petrograd should the present advance of the, Esthonians and Russians lead to the capture of that town.Latvia.        ...The situation has shown no improvement, in fact has become considerably worse.     The influence or the Germans is growingstronger and in the opinion of S.N.O., they do not intend to evacuate the Province.    Large numbers of their troops (8,000 todate) have enliBted in Baltic formations, and Civil War orBolshevism are inevitable, as the Letts will never be reconciled toliving under Bait or German rule.The Naval Harbour at Libau is/ being put in a state of defence,by the Germans, and guns have been mounted which are a directmenace to our ships, and under these circumstances, unless decisivesteps are immediately taken, it may become necessary for our shipsm to leave Libau which is the chief port for the blockade control of9 the Baltic. ;It is reported that on May 24th at Libau two German soldiers arrested a British midshipman in uniform, the grounds alleged being that he threatened German soldiers with his gun^ and
carried no pass signed by the Admiral,     On the same day five other Q British Kaval Officers were arrested by the Germans on the grounds that they had unlawfully taken away fuzes, cartridges, etc. from a German Munitions Depository, and that they had endeavoured to bribe the German. Sentry.The British offioers who were very rudely treated state that the sentry gave them permission to pick up a few cartridges, etc., which were lying on the ground, and which they took as souvenirs, and that.they gave the sentry a small tip which he accepted.     In&apos; both cases the officers were released after a few hours&apos; detention, &quot;but stn.- explanation   and apology has been demanded and in the mean-time German ships are forbidden to enter or leave the harbour of Libau.     Commodore Duff is to enquire into the matter immediately on his arrivals      The S.NV0. is of the opinion that these incidents will recur owing to the fact that the Allies have taken no steps to insist on their orders being carried out with regard to the removal of Von der Goltz and the re-instatement of the Lettish Government and army.ffinland. ; ,General GoughtsMission in H.M.S; &quot;Galatea&quot; arrived at. Helsingfors on May 26th and the General had an interview with the Regent and the &quot;Prime minister-o     The tfinns have proposed conditions upon which they would be willing to assist in operations against . potrograd which include the neutralisation of the Baltic being limited to the Russian fleet and the demolition of Kronstadt and corresponding Finnish fortresses/ and the cession of Pechenga and a narrow strip connecting that port w:i-in&apos;- Finnish territory.-NORTHERN RUSSIA.Archangel.General Grogan with the first  Elief force arrived on May ,  26th and was received by the Governor General and the General   .

White Sea considers that owing to low- water in the 11, ;Dwina an$ monitors which have not already left England should not now be sent out and that all work should be concentrated on small draught gunboats and transport craft.Aeroplane reconnaissance on May 25th located 17 enemy river craft at Troitsa and 33 at Pechuga.     The enemy attacked KleshoVo and Kerneshka on the Onega river but Were repulsed.   They also dropped bombs on our positions on the railway front;. Gaptain Altham in &quot;Borodinow has proceeded up river to take over the command of the British river forces, i &quot;Murmansk.Floods have washed away the. railway between Kola and Polozero and some days must elapse before traffic can be resumed. Owing tpy our rapid advance, Medvyeja Gora was very little damaged and it will make an excellent base for future operations - 8 miles to the South we are in touch with enemy outposts.   Troops from Poventtz across the lake have landed 26 miles S.S. of Medvyeja Gora and 300 rifles have been sent to arm local peasants, who are strongly anti-Bolshevik.     The destruction of bridges is unfortunately hindering the transport of a motor flotilla to Lake Onega.MEDITERRANEAN.The question of terminating the post of Allied C. in 0.   in the Mediterranean is now a subject of discussion between Admiral Hope and
trie French Minister of Marine. )        The trouble, in, the &quot;Europa&quot; i3 happily ended and H.M.

Mariupol was recaptured from the Bolsheviks on May 24th and the Volunteer Army-is advancing westwards.     It is proposed to hand over 6 - 6&quot; guns from H.M.S. &quot;Grafton&quot; to the Volunteer Army provided C-in-C. Mediterranean agrees.Admiral Troubridge is Acting President of the Temporary Inter-Allied Commission having jurisdiction over the whole of the Danube which has been appointed by the Sup seme Economic Council, and he has been nominated as the British xepresentative on the Permanent Danube Commission which will have jurisdiction over the Lower River.CASPIANAiroraft reconnaissance on May 18th at Port Alexandrovsk reported that the Bolshevik flotilla of 2 depot ships. 8 torpedo boats, 2 gunboats, 14 minelayers and 5 armed merchantmen were lying in the bay.On May 20th Bolshevik forces wore engaged and it is reported that 1 armed merchantman and 1 t.b. were sunk, 1 large barge with 2 - 6&quot; guns damaged and beached and probably another barge blown up as a large explosion was observed.     Our casualties Were slight, 2 killed, 3 died of wounds, 3 Russians killed and 2 wounded.     Owing to this engagement the Bolsheviks appear to have temporarily abandoned Aloxandrovsk.     It is reported that the Bolshevik artillery greatly outranged the British.    Further information is awaited.On May 23rd, Denikin commenced an advance on Astrakhan, with three columns?-one concentrated in the Kisliar - Chornoe Rinok area will advance along the coast road, ... another concentrated in Yusmul Krestia will advance via Sangir Knud-Dausna and the third will concentrate, near Briahski and on June 5th will endeavour to land on the S.B. coast of Astrakhan when Volunteer Army forces are expected to be besieging Astrakhan from the V/est.General Milne had proposed the immediate evacuation of Krasnovodsk and petrovsk b,ut as a result of an Admiralty protest it ia understood that, it is now intended to reinforce Irasnovodsk.It is understood from Paris that the Italians will after all relieve us in the Caspian and Caucasus. This will be a far more satisfactory solution than if the fleet were handed over to Denikdn.
