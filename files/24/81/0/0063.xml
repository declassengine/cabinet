If a statement oould be made^ that prices would be oontrollod, it would go a long way to meet disoontent, s the margin between privation and sufficiency i3 a very narrow one for the lower paid workers.   Tho increase in leisure is being exploited by propagandists, who are using the fine weather for a summer campaignsSUMMARYMOMMMMM 0 CO&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;*The/
HI   2  *The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; is doing mlsohief in the British Army of Oooupation and on the Lines of Communication,The King&apos;s Visit to Leicester was an unqualified suooess.Tho agitation among the workers for eooaping Inoome Tax is growing, ** A: .\ ,j. &apos;-v.     w&apos; ,&apos;The Hebrew community have been profoundly movSd by the reports of pogroms in Poland.The Polios agitation is simmering down and the extremists are discredited.The problem of obtaining employment for demobilised, offloors is;acute, and the unemployment among demobilised soldiers is still a serious matter,The Soviet system is openly advocated in Woolwioh,The Conference of the Transport Workers1 Federation h olearsd the air, The leaders are unlikely to pledge their followers to politioal action lightly in the near future.
THE ROYAL VISIT TO IfllQEaTBR. *The Royal Visit was an unqualified suooesB, and I hear on all sides that the King&apos;s speeoh made &apos;a great impression.   The address of the Town Clerk was almost inaudible, whereas His Majesty&apos;s voioe was distinctly heard by every person in the audience.   There were many approving oomments upon this oontrast,POLldH UlfRBSTThe Police situation is such brighter.   The Commissioner addressed a large number of the men in the Queen1s Hall on June 10th and was received more than cordially.   \$y Yorkshire correspondent informs me that, exoept in Sheffield, the policy of the Police Union is almost universally discredited and that the men appear to be leaving the Union.   At a demonstration in Glasgow on the 3th, whioh was addressed by John Maclean and George fibury and others, Bbury said that the Glasgow Police were &quot;a lot of ignorant hogs who wanted to form a Union and join the Labour Party, but he for one would &quot;. strongly oppose it, as there was no difference between a union and a non-union baton.&quot;The loyal men of the Metropolitan Polioe wfco joined the Union for a quiet life, appear to be much relieved by the discomfiture of the extremists.On June 6th, 9C0 colliers belonging to the Welsh : Navigation Steam Coal Company struok because two colliers at Pontypridd had been arrested for non-payment of inocme Tax.   The men were released, and: work was resumed in the afternoon.  The movement is championed by the revolutional element; in Lancashire It has the unanimous support of the workers sinoe their own pookets are oonoerned.   No direct action is, however, likely at the moment,/ INTERNATIONAL ONAL/
&amp;  **(EJngliah)INTKKNATIONAL PROTEST AGAINST IN^RVBHyiON IN&apos; russia the Italian Sooialist Lazzari has stated that Jeefl Longuet and Ramsay Maodonald have agreed to a twenty-four hours general strike in Franoe, Italy and England as a mark of sympathy with the Soviet form of Governing The Italian Socialists have already succeeded in preventing an Italian ship from being used for the transport of munitions to Russia,In an interview with the &quot;Herald&quot; on the 10th Junl Ramsay Maodonald took the view that if the Communist Governments of Russia and Hungary are overthrown, the working classes will have lost evil ohanoes of benefiting from the war.   He also regarded a RevolutioJ in Italy as puobablo.   Ho has. been severely handled by &quot;The Times&quot;, an$iis rather.ingenuous protest whioh appeared to-day will not improve h,is position.   A report, just received-, states that his mission entirelj failed in Switzerland, where he was ooldly received. In Italy he was more successful, and the party is rath flattered at having attracted attention in Sngland.  T( visit has- certainly strengthened the Left Wing of the party.&quot; &quot;&apos;UNRB3T IK SOUTH WALESMeetings are being held in Cardiff to protest against conscription, the Inoome Tax and intervention in Bussia.   The Unofficial Reform Committee is tauntifl the Exeoutive of the Triple Alllanoe with the futility of the Alliarioe.   A pamphlet, &quot;Control of the Mines by the Miners %- compiled by extremists in the Rhondda Valley, is shortly to be issuedr. gjsinn mm in WAigsIrishmen in South Wales have formed a &quot;Self-determination/
determination League&quot; with branches at Newport, Bargoed. and Cardiff.   A Sinn Fein Club, affiliated to Dublin, has been opened in Merthyr., My correspondent reports that Bolsheviks and Sinn Feiners were behind the Newport colour riots.A seditious leaflet, &quot;To the Irish in England&quot;, by de Valera, was consigned in bulk to a man in South Shields. The printer and consignor will be dealt with if their identity can be ascertained,WOOLWICHThere has been much socialist aotlvity in Woolwich. .  Meetings are held almost daily during the dinner hour, at which the heed of linking up all labour organisations for direot action is advocated.COVENTRYThe air has been noticeably dearer during the last week,   A meeting of the Workers&apos; Committee, where the usual violent speeches were made, was poorly attended, and the audience was apathetlo.THE &quot;expansion SCOUTS&quot;At a Socialist meeting held at Thornton Heath on the 1st June, addressed by Robert Smillie and Guy Aldred, the chairman announced the formation of the &quot;Red Scouts of the Labour Party&quot; for boys at Thornton Heath,THE INDEPENDENT LABOUR PARTYThe summer campaign of the Independent Labour Party is not fulfilling the anticipations of its promoters. At Manchester, the party is charged with paying too muoh attention to foreign affairs.   On the other hand, the demonstration at Glasgow to demand withdrawal fromintervention/
(English)^intervention and the release of the Clyde prisoners, held on the 1st June, was better attended than during the previous weeks. ;,The Party is in touch with the Indian representativej who have recently arrived in this country; at least one, branch meeting has passed a Resolution condemning the Rowlatt Act.THE BRITISH SOCIALIST PARTYThis Party appears from its balanos sheet to be in very low water.   The &quot;Call&quot; appears to be run at a loss, the deficit for the year being  162.Albert Inkpln is making progress in organising the Party on a revolutionary basis, but 11, Alexander, the Treasurer, and E, 0. Fairchild have resigned from the Executive Committee because it is beooming too revolution Alexander has been suoceasful in raising money for the Pa and his loss will undoubtedly affect it financially; he now talks of going to France.During a raid on the 2nd June, at the premises of J. T. Lyne, a manuscript of Lonin&apos;s book, which had been entrusted to Lyne for translation, was seized.   It was to be distributed by tho British Socialist Party.&apos;:  THE LONDON WORKERS&apos; COMMITTEEThi3 Committee is very active.   It has issued 7,000 invitations for its Conference on the. 14th Juno, and Bomfi fifty applications from branohes of the National Union of .  Railwaymen and others have beon reoeived; other Trade Union branches have promised financial assistance.   The Conference will be held in Kings Weigh House.   Fortnightl- *&apos;.meetings are to.be held at the Communist Club, but the Committee believes the pamphlet system to be the mosteffeotive/
effeotive form of propaganda, and has reoently issued a *        oiroular advocating class war.There appears to be some.friction between the Labour Party and this Committee.THE COMMUNIST LEAGUE        -The rooms at Heddon Street have been given up, and the League will in future meet at the Communist Club.   The members appear principally to be anarchists from the British Sooialist Party.and the Herald League.SAILORS1 . SOLDIERS&apos; AND AI3MBN&apos;S union on June 2nd there was a meeting at Chandos Hall between tho representatives of this Union and the National Union of Ex-Service Men.   If the amalgamation takes plaoe it will be under the title of &quot;Service and Ex-Service Men&apos;s ; * Labour Party&quot;, and will be a Sooialist organisation for &quot;linking up all service and ex-servioe men into the ranks of Labour to bring about a Revolution.&quot;   The Chairman, D. carmichael of the London Trades Council - who was concerned in the Police Strike - laid great stress on the need for unions amongst serving soldiers, and urged that discharged men must combine to prevent their serving brothers from being victimised by the authorities.NATIONAL FEDERATION OF DISCHARGED Ai,D DEMOBILISED SAILORS AND SOLDIERS. _-j.At the Annual Conference of the Federation on june 8th, a rule was made allowing officers who had not served in the ranks to join the Federation, and a Resolutionrefusing alliance with any democratic politioal body wascarried by a large majority.   On the other hand, somebranohes show an increase in revolutionary sentiments,and/
(English)

and the Executive Council has forbidden ex-service men to "blackleg" the Police.

My Glasgow correspondent reports that discharged soldiers are holding meetings, at which very revolutionary speeches are being made. The International Union of Ex-Service Men- a Glasgow concern - is so extreme in its   views that it is likely to defeat its own ends.

THE NATIONAL UNION OF RAILWAYMEN.

There appears to be a steady growth in what is known as the Vigilant Committee movement, and it is hoped to ? a National Vigilance Committee.  At one of the meetings, Comrade Turner stated that members were invited to join the "Intelligence Branch" for service in the workshops.

NO-CONSCRIPTION FELLOWSHIP AND FELLOWSHIP OF RECONCILIATION.

These two societies, which are closely connected, have fallen upon evil days. The former will call a Convention in October to consider whether it shall continue to exist and the latter is appealing urgently for funds.

THE JEWISH LABOUR PARTY

A Conference was held at the Old King&apos;s Hall on June 6th to protest against the pogroms in Poland; Judaism, from the Chief Rabbi&apos;s Court to the anarohists, was well represented. The Jewish community has been profoundly ?  by the pogroms, and it was decided that on a date to be fixed this month there should be a general strike of every Jewish worker in shops, kinemas and theatres and that bla? flags and badges should be displayed. A permanent ? has been elected to make the arrangements.

JOHN MCLEAN

John McLean addressed a meeting at Holmfirth, Yorkshire on
on May 31st.   Ho is described as raving like a madman add shouting, &quot;Seize the land; down with the capitalists; unite for Revolution; seise the workshops from, the robbers; on with the Revolution 1&quot;    About 400 men and boys were present.W. P. WATSONThis man is now attempting to; do what he oalls &quot;sabotage the Police&quot;* that is to say, he is going to write anonymous letters aoousing one Police officer to another in order to promote disruption and suspicion.   He is very much averso to serving his sentence,MISS SYLVIA PAMKfflJRSr.Ivfir. Joseph&apos;King,&apos; ex-M.P,, has sent  25 to Miss SylviaPankhurst to pay for paper; the gift was not acknowledgedin the &quot;Workersr&apos; Dreadnought&quot;,   It is said that this paper - is selling well in South Wales and in ports of Ireland, andthat the leaflet :fThe Peoples Russian Information BureauBulletin&quot; is widely read.   On the other hand, the printer,Francis, has given Miss Pankhurst notice that he cannotprint the &quot;Dreadnought&quot; after next month.MR. CHARLES TRBVBLYAN.,,In the &quot;Dually Herald&quot; of the 3rd June, to. Trovslyan urged that Labour should abstain from the Peace celebrations and that Labour Leaders should issue a declaration to the effect that their first offioial act would be to denounoe the peaoe Treaty as void&apos;,MR. PHILIPS PRICE,It is reported that the &quot;Command in Cologne has evidenoo that Phillips Price has been engaged with an American journalist named Minor - now under arrest - ininoiting/
mi   3 &apos; w.(Inciting Allied soldiers to revolt.   Minor -was arrested the French and handed over to the&apos; ianerioans, and if thai evidence against Price is sufficient he too will be arrested if he ventures into the oooupied territory.The Editor of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; has sent him 4,0C: marks, through a Dr. Van Blankenstoyn.THE &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot;There is undoubted evidence that the &quot;Daily Herald doing mischief to the morale of the troops serving in Franoe, not only on the Lines of Communication but in t! Army of Occupation. If possible, the export of this paj should be prevented. It is also, of oourse, doing a oo; amount of harm in this oountry, though there is a tend now that the effect of the seoret oircular is we&amp;ring. to find its politioal bias a little wearying. The worM man buys his paper for news not views.The Editor has been trying to get a personal mossaj from Lenin, through a contributor to the &quot;Folltets Dagbl Politiken&quot;, an extremist Swedish organ. He is also in touch with Philips Prios in Germany.IRELAND.. Tho week ending 31st May was comparatively unovent: without any new development of Sinn Fein activity.
