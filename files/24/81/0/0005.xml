coal mines&quot; (control) bill.Dote by the President of the Board of Trade,I circulate a Draft Bill which has been prepared with a view to carrying out the recommendations of the First Beport of&amp;the Sankey Commission.     Though legislation on the lines of this Bill will certainly be required. I d*o not recommend that the Bill should be introduced into parliament until the Second Elport dealing with the question of nationalisation is reoeived from the Sankey Commission.    My object in circulating^ the Bill at this stage is to show the complexity of the legislation which will be necessary to carry out the recommendations of the First Beport   and to obtain an immediate decision oaa one point.    This point, relates to new capital expendi-ture.    It is particularly urgent that approval or otherwise should be given forthwith to the provisions contained in Clause 15 of this Bill, as it is highly desirable in order to get develop^sments restarted that the owners should be at once informed that the Government undertake to include thaee provisions in the Bill. 1 propose, therefore, with the consent of my Colleague^,to authorise such eomirninication to. the owners, and to furnish, them with a copy of the provisions of Clause 15.A.C CFDDES, 3.6,19.
