rThis Document Is the Property of(   A (*. His Britannio tylaj&amp;sty&apos;s government!FUTURE OP THE SUGAR COMMISSION.I,^Hp^,   /V    MEMORANDUM BY THE POOD CONTROLLER.\ . \.   /S  \\ArPr,--------^c$sfrequested by the War Cabinet in their Minute No. 569-&quot;Indecision (e), I have had under further consideration the questionof the future of the Royal Commission on the Sugar Supplies, and Icirculate herewith,, for the information of the War Cabinet, aMemorandum prepared by Sir Henry Primrose.On the whole I am of opinion, in view of the great uncertainty as to future world supplies and prices, that it will be desirableto continue the work of the Commission to a later date than thatpreviously contemplated (which was the end of the present year).I recommend, accordingly, that the Commission should be authorisedand instructed to oontinue in business and to make purchases on thebasis of having three months supply of sugar in stock at the end ofthe financial year, March 31, 1920.   I recommend, further, that theposition should be reconsidered in the beginning of next Decemberwitih a view to deciding whether still further purchases should be made by the Commission.In making this recommendation I desire to point out that havingregard to present and prospective prices, it is exceedingly unlikelythat after the end of the present year or at any rate after Marchh*xt it will be possible either for the Sugar Commission or forsugarprivate traders to plaoe/upon the market at prices allowing the present retail price to be retained.   It will be necessary either to raise the retail price to the public or for the Treasury to incur a financial loss either ,by reducing the present sugar duty or by assenting to the Sugar Commission winding up its business with a substantial deficiency.GEO. H. ROBERTS *Ministry of Pood, June 6th 1919.
DE-CONTROL OF THE SUGAR SUPPLY.1 111 &quot;&apos; .......... ,iiiiinii,(xfi *a iiTom. im mi   mi.....n.....ni.i-iHM.iiimm(1)   Looked at purely from the point of view of the Sugar Commission, the question of dissolving the Commission presents no&apos; great difficulty. Our position is this, We have purchased enough sugar to maintain supply up to the end of this year; and although we are selling sugar at less than it is now costing us, wo could continue to do so until our supplies, actual and prospective, were exhausted, and yet remain with a substantial balance in hand. As at present estimated, that balance would be about  4,500:^000. If American exchange should Ml heavily, or if control of shipping came to an end, and we had to pay for freight at the current market rates, that figure would be appreciably reduced.. But a sufficient balance would probably remain.(2)   Thus at any moment we might announce (1) what our stocks, actual and prospective are; (2) that we should do nothing to add to them, (3) that they would suffice to meet consumption at its current rate up to such and such a date; and (4) that after that date the maintenance of the sugar supply would be left to the ordinary agencies and channels of trade,(3)   But for reasons to be explained, it is not possible to deal with this matter by reference solely to the position and interests of the Sugar Commission. If the ordinary agencies of trade are to be responsible for maintaining the Sugar Supply after the Commission goes out of action,&apos; those agencies, which have been for nearly five years In a condition of suspended animation, must have got themselves into working order again before the Commission comes to an end.   Otherwise there would be a famine period in sugar, after our supplies were exhausted.(4)   Not/ for the agencies to get themselves into working order two things are necessary.(a) a sufficiency of shipping, with a fairly well established level for rates of freight; and(b) opportunity to the Trade for some months before the Commission disappears of doing business in sugar.So far as can be foreseen, unless new international complications arise,, the first of those conditions seems likely to be fulfilled well before the end of this year. The second presents greater difficulty.(5)   The opportunities for doing business must be such as will allow of the revestablishment of what is known as &quot;a terminal market&quot; for sugar; that is to say, a market in which forward contracts can be done and undone as circumstances require. With sugar at its present worlWs price and with the uncertainties surrounding trade in the future, very few traders oou2d venture to run the risk of commitments on a large scale, unless there were a free and active market In which they could buy or sell with certainjby But commitments on a large scale are a necessity, if an adequate and regular sugar supply is to be assured,(6) Now a difficulty in the way Of opening to traders a field for doing business arises out of the fact that the Commission is selling sugar, and tan continue for some time to sell sugar at some  10, to  12, per ton (equal in retail prices to Id, to ljd per lb) below the price at which a private importer can import,- If freights fell, this difference would be correspondingly reduced; but the reductions is not likely to be more than  3. or  4, per ton, so that a substantial difference must continue,(7)   But so long as there is a difference which enables the Commission to undersell the private trader, the private trader cannot do business on any large scale. To enable him to do this it would indeed be desirable that the difference should be theother way - so as to counteract the eftect of the overhanging of the market by the large stocks held by the Commission,(8) There is no escape from the conclusion that, before a return to incontrolled trade can take place, the Commission^ prices must be brought Lnto conformity with the natural or v/orld^s prices0
H,W,P,(9)   But this means an increase in the retail price of the commodity l,ld. or even ljd. per lb.   Sooner or later such a rise is probably inevit-lile*   Once the Commission^ stocks and surplus have been exhausted, yioes must go to their natural level; and the best expert opinion is to effect that for 1920 at any rate the natural price will-not be muchIfat all, below that now prevailing,   in any case it is likely to be above Je Commission1s present artificial price for some considerable time, (10)   Whether the rise in price takes place now, or later, it will be isented by the consumer; and to avoid   this it has been suggested that pos-tbly the Chancellor of the Exchequer might be willing to balance the rise j a corresponding reduction in the Dutya   On the Commission^ stocks this jjuld make no difference to the Exchequer receipts, as they would be in-ceased by our increased receipts on sales by exactly the same  amount as he Customs would lose on the Duty,(11)   In discussing this suggestion the Chancellor of the Exchequer sked whether if we planned to buy.enough sugar to maintain the supply up to pril 1920, we could procure the sugar, and if so, whether we could do so ithout exhausting our reserve.   On the whole we think the sugar could 6 procured, at a price, . But whether we could procure it without exhaust-ng our surplus is so extremely doubtful, depending as it does on so many nknown factors, that we cannot venture to make a confident prediction. If wnpelled to express an opinion now, we should be disposed to say that the peratlon could not be carried out without leaving ias with a debit balance,(12) To sum up the bearing of all this on the question of the date atftich the Sugar Commission might, or should, go out of action- (we shallf course need some months to wind up our affairs, after our doors are losed to the public)   - the alternatives are   as follows(1)   If we were to put up our prices to the natural price of the day at once , (either with or without a corresponding reduction in the duty), and were to give due notice to the Trade, we could close our public life perhaps by 30th September, and certainly by the end of the year.i2)   If we deferred the raising of prices for (say) three months we could still make our exit by 31st december,(3)   If we enter into contracts for an additional 600,000 tons of sugar, it would ensure supplies up to about   the end of April, 1920, and leave a working stock of about a month5s supply.   But as already stated, this might result in leaving us at the end with a debit balance.   This look3 as though it would tide matters over until the date of next yearfs budget;, but it is doubtful if it would really do so, because, so long as we continue to sell at an artificially low pries, we make impossible the resumption of activity by the ordinary agencies of trade, and   therefore   those agencies would not be ready,in April to take up responsibility for maintaining the future supply.   Thus unless meanwhile there was a heavy fall in the world!s prices, (of which there is no reasonable prospeot), we should be no better off in April than we are now, towards cessation of Government control of the Sugar Supply*(13)   There isafurther point that must not be overlooked.   The majority 1 our staff are men drawn from Mincing Lane, and when Mincing Lane itumes activity they will be anxious to return to their employment there, -oause they may  not be able to&apos; afford to remain in the service of the Emission at the risk of losing permanent employment. The longer the unmission continues, the more difficult will it be for it to keep its &apos;esent staff together.(14)   In this note the question of Decontrol has been treated almost iOMy from the point of view of date. Questions as regards the exact ocedure to be followed in effecting the transition from control to ee trading are lively to avLse; but these can be considered later.
