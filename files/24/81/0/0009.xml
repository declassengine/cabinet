This Document is the Property ofSEGBESLHis Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.ffj..-,&quot;.i-PROPOSED R^lISSIOH OP BTOGST DUTI3S.BR.&quot;&quot;^^T^Swe carefully read the Minutes of the Cabinet Meeting of (Thursday, May 29th, and I earnestly hope that the v;Jar Cabinet will receive the report from the Pood Controller on the enquiries which he is charged to undertake before finally talcing any decision with regard to the suggested remission of Budget Duties, which would mean a surrender of revenue of thirteen millions.The difficulties of the Treasury in raising money for services which the Government is pledged to undertake, are enormous, and I cannot but think that before making so immense a sacrifice of revenue there should be some secure and adequate compensating advantage than the scheme appears to provide.The proposals in question, it seems to me:- (l) would not lead to the provision of an additional quantity of Beer, (2) would not lead to any diminution in price, (SJ do not give any security whatever that we should in fact get the increased gravity of 30, which it is sought to obtain, and consequently no surety of obtaining any increase of quality beyond what it is hoped to obtain by raising the gravity to 10400.If we are to sacrifice thirteen millions of revenue, the least that we oould look for in return would be the promotion of an increased measure of satisfaction among those who consume beer. This does not seem to be secured, and in the absence of it, I am quite unable to gather from the discussion, what benefit is secured, unless it be a diminution in anticipated opposition in Parliament.I have, of coursej no means of measuring what that opposition may amount to, but in view of the great additional profits which the Trade has made during the War, as is well known, I think it may well be that the dropping of so huge a mass of revenue might provoke as much opposition both in Parliament and outside as its imposition, in pursuance of a clearly understood policy would arouse.I can understand opposition in respect of &quot;washy beer&quot; or &quot;high price of beer&quot;, but I do not think that a very good Parliamentary case could be made for refraining from making the suggested inroads into the profits of the Trade, which are well known to have been very generous of late.0. aPDISOfl.May 50th 1919.
