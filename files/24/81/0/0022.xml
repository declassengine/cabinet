ISSUE OF OFFICIAL COMMUNICATIONS TO THE PRESS.(Circulated by the Home Secretary).On the 1st May the War Cabinet discussed the question of establishing a oehtral agency for the issue of official communications by Government Departments (War Cabinet 561 * Minute l), and decided that:-(a) It should be left to each Department to make its own arrangements for sending its communications to the Press.(b) The Home Secretary should consider whether it was necessary to enquire further into the position of the Provincial press in this matter, and, if he thought it desirable, should oonsider whether any further steps could be taken to meet their wishes.I have made enquiry as regards (b) and have ascertained that so far as short statements are concerned the Provincial press experience no difficulties as the Press Association and other agencies telegraph these in full to the Provincial newspapers.    In oases however when the communication is too long to telegraph in full the Provincial Press only reoeive a summary from the Press agenoies whereas the London newspapers often receive from the Departments a copy of the dooument in full.I understand that the Press Association have now arranged to send copies of communications whioh are too long to telegraph in full to the London offices of the Provincial newspapers and for this purpose the Press Association requires 40 copies of such communications.    If Government Departments therefore will arrange to send 4C oopies to the Press Association, the wishes of the Provincial Press will be met.    The press Association also undertakes to ciroulate communications to the London newspapers in the same way, but in that oase an extra 20 oopies are required, making 60 copies in all.I am informed that the system of delayed publication has proved a great convenience to the Press and often has the advantage of securing greater publicity. Under this system a dooument can be sent to the Press marked for publication two days later.    If this is sent to the Press Association in the afternoon it will be posted to all the Provincial newspapers the same day. and will be received by them next day, and all newspapers, London and Provincial will then be in a position to publish it simultaneously on the day following.    Newspapers can then arrange to give greater space to the communication if they oonsider it of sufficient public importance.    Where immediate publication is not required the system of delayed publication can be adopted with advantage. . S s5th June, 1919.
