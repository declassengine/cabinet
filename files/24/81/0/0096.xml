THIi DO0UUSI1T IS Tig PROPERTY Off HIS i^IMIUO MAJE^TS CK)VERflMEMT) .Memo rand-um by tho Pre si do nt of tho Board, of Education.Tho Minister of Food and I rnot the representatives of the Brewers Society on Thursday, June 12th, and put before, them the proposals of tho Cabinet,, i^o. that the average gravity should remain at 1040, that tho increase of three degrees should be given in boor below 7d* and that beer under 1020 should not bo sold for more than 2d*Tho brewers replied that they would have no difficulty in complying with the last recommendation, but that thoy could not guarantee three degrees on industrial beer unless they wero permitted to raise tho sovenpenny and eightpenny boor by a like amounto      If the average gravity were raiBed to 1043 they oould meet tho Government, but not if it remained at 10408     They urged that it would be impossiblo to guarantee that the consumer would got the benefit of the thirteen millions unless this were done.    a brewer   alroady brewing round and about 1040 could not givo away three degrees on 4d. beor without loworing the gravity of his heavy beer. If he were told that he must raise the gravity of his fourpenny beer, he would say &quot;No, it will pay mo better not to brew it at all, and there would be less fourpenny beer on the market&quot;. Consequently if the brewers who were brewing on the upper limit now were to oontributo to tho improvement of industrial beer, they must be given an extra three degroos to do it with.In other words the brewers say &quot;If you wish to make certain that your thirteen millions is going to the improvement of industrial beer, you must give us three degrees all along the scale.      If you do that we will personally guarantee that we will improve the quality of our own industrial beer, and will see that the Brewers Society uses its influence to the same end.     We do not of courso give an absolute guarantee that tho advantage to the consumer will be exactly thirteen millions. We cannot do that.   That rrther is tho business of the Food Controller;   but wo want to seo the quality of beer improved, and if we are given an average of 1043, wo can see to it that a very great part of the thirteen millions is spent upon its improvement.&quot;My view is that if the&apos;Cabinot is desirous of spending thirteen millions in improving the quality of industrial beer it would be wiso to accept the brewers1 proposal and raise the average gravity to 1043*   Then at least the Government would, have the brewers behind them,,   They would be accepting tho brewers&apos; own proposals and could count upon as larga a measure of support as tho Brewers Society is able to give.   Much as I should regret any departure from the 1040 limit at present, I doubt whether it would wise to abandon thirteen millionsG,T.7496oW A cabinet,THE GRAVITY OF BEER.
45tjf revenue in order to obtain a definite result, the amelioration of industrial boor, while at the same time you continue to ^vobo a condition, which the brewers tell you is incompatible with the ; attainment of your end and the observance,..of which will, at any rate, render them unwilling to co-operate.We arc led therefore to an election of one of two ;alternative policies, either to throw away thirteen millions of revenue and to raise the gravity to 1043, or to levy thirteen millions of revenue and to keep the gravity at 1040.Let ua consider the arguments in support of these two alternative courses.   The announcement that the Government is taking steps to improve the quality of industrial beer will un-doubtedly be popular.   Even if the brewer benefits from the transaction more than the consumer, the consumer will imagine^ that bar beer which he is consuming is better than it really is, since he has been told that the Government has raised the gravity. Moreover the increase of three degrees is not largo enough to affect to any appreciable degree the sobriety of the country. It is even arguable that it will make in favour of temperance rather than against it by discouraging the resort to spirits as an alternative to weak and unpalatable beer. There is another consideration in favour of this couruts to which a certain weight should be attached.   The Trade is a very powerful organisation capable of creating and sustaining a vigorous agitation in the country in favour of any course in which it conceives that its interests are enlisted.   Give the Trade this concession and it will be quieted.   Refuse it this concession and you will inevit-ably have its influence thrown against you.   Even if we cannot secure that the whole thirteen.millions flows down the throats of the working class, we can at least by this surrender of revenue compose some actual discontent and avert the chance of greater troubles to come.There are, however, very powerful arguments for the alternative course.   Thirteen millions a year is a grand revenue for a Chancellor of the Exchequer, which, if spent on the rc-duction of redundant houses, would enable him to put the Trade once and for all on a wholesome footing.   In any case uses can-be found for the&apos; money more valuable, from a permanent point of view, than its employment upon the improvement of beer.   Indeed, it would be difficult to justify the surrender of so large a revenue unless the Government were convinced either that a, great body of legitimate discontent would be removed by the concession, or that it was necessary in order to arrest a growing resort to spirits.   It must be remembered that the Government has not shown itself indifferent to the question of quality and that the average gravity has alreagy in the coarse of the last few months been raised eight degrees.   To the critic who censures the Government for doing nothing to improve the quality of beer the reply is firstly, that the gravity has been raised from 1032 to 1040; secondly that most brewers have not yet reached their permitted &apos; maximum;   and thirdly that .as a matter of fact there has been-a considerable improvement in the quality of much of the light beer which has been put on the market.   As to the discontent, its chief cause is admittedly shortage of supply.   The shortage, however   -s now in course of being remedied., and it remains to be seennow muchL   I?!?6? will SLllTive v;hon  the BUP^y of be6r Is &quot;brought level with the demand and the full effect of the recent   corses-sion in gravity has made itself felt.   It is also premature to conclude that a further advance in gravity is essential as a saiegusrcL against the resort to spirits.
So far we have been dealing with a wholly abnormal situation. There has been a marked shortage of alcoholic liquor of all kinds. All liquids have been drunk, and though there is some evidence of spirits beirr; preferred to washy beer or mixed with it, there is much evidence of spirits being drunk because no other liquid is obtainablef     The important point to notice is that everything has been drunk.    There has been no difficulty in selling the   k washy beer,     Consequently while it is necessary to watch with care the influence of the lighter beer on the consumption of spirits, it will be easier to test the capacity of light beer to resist the competition of spirits a few months hence, when the problem is no longer complicated by the inadequacy  of supply,Meanwhile there are strong grounds of policy for adhering for the present to the 1040 limit,   The policy of the Government should be to encourage the brewing of good light beers and to establish a taste for good light beers in the industrial population.    There are signs that these desirable results have been promoted by the policy of restriction, and there is every reason to fear that they would be jeopardised by the abandonment of restriction,    It is true that an advance of three degrees is in itself no great matter, but the concession coming so closely in the train of previous concessions would encourage the brewers to press for further relaxations and would create the impression that the Government could be driven from point to point if only adequate pressure were a.plied.    There would therefore be a diminished inducement to the brewers to compete with one enother in the production of palatable light beers.    Hay, indeed, should they put themselves to this trouble if there were good reason to hope that the restrictions upon gravity would be progressively and swiftly relaxed?For these reasons I am in favour of adhering to the 1040 limit at ;resent. Later on we shall be able more clearly to see whether and to what extent it may be expedient to raise it.H.A.L. Fisher.Board of Education, Whitehall S.W.1,15th June 1919.
