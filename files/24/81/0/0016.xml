From Viceroy, Foreign Department, Uh June 1019. * (Received 11 a.m.).Clear the line.801 S. Your telegram of 30th May. Afghanistan. When trouble began 1 sent personal letter to all Ruling Princes and Chiefs explaining situation. In their replies all important Rulers have offered their resources to Government, expressing detestation of Amir&apos;s action and their unswerving loyalty to the throne. Nizam of Hyderabad, Begum of Bhophal, and other rulers have taken necessary measures to ensure that their Muslim subjects shall be fully enlightened as to real circumstances of Afghan attack, and shall realise that no religious question is involved. Nizam in placing his Imperial Service Troops and resources at disposal of Government of India has specially asked me to convey his respectful and humble oiler to His Majesty. From among offers of personal service the rulers of Patiala, Dholpur, Katlani, Bana, and the two sons of the Nawab of Loharu, including heir apparent have been appointed to staff in field. Sir Partap was eager to go, but I discouraged him on grounds of importance of his duties as Regent of Joclhpur. Other offers under consideration. All ruling Princes and Chiefs who - maintain Imperial Service Troops have offered their units which in some cases have only just returned from the front. Contingents of cavalry, infantry, artillery, sappers and (? transport from) Faridkot, Gwalior, Indore, Jaipur, Kashmir, Khairpur, Maler Kotla, Patiala, Rampur, Sirmur and Tehri have been selected for active service or garrison duty in India and employment of Imperial Service Troops of Bikaner, Kapurthala and Nabha is under consideration. Offer of camels (? motor cars) and of money for provision of comforts for troops engaged in campaign are being received and accepted. Nepakse Government offered assistance last Feb-ruary on army death. When hostilities began I asked Prime Minister for Nepal contingent and he promptly agreed to send it in spite of great difficulties of moving troops through Terai in hot weather. Arrangements are being made for reception of troops in India. They will be accompanied by two Generals of the Nepalese Army. Loyal messages and offers of assistance have also been received from Chiefs and Governors of Gilgit Agency, from the Khan of Kalat and tribes in Baluchistan. The Mehtar of Chitral has actively assisted in repelling invading parties and the Nawab of Dir has offered services of his son and has expelled all Afghan agents who were in his country. Sardar Muhammed Yokub Khan, ex-Amir of Afghanistan, has offered services of himself and his sons. You &quot;may think it worth while to include this information among papers proposed to be presented to Parliament.
