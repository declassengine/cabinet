"All quiet Kurram, Thal and Kohat, and lashkar dispersing. Kurram reports Nadir Khan is still at Matun with (1) Babrak Jadran, (2) Hazrat Sahib. (3) Lalapur. He expects reinforcements and hopes to (? renew) attack before Id. Enemy beginning to withdraw from Peiwar Kotal to (corrupt group) above Kharlachi, possibly expecting attack. Gathering at Chinarak was more jirga than lashkar and has broken up, only about 200 remaining. Wattizai Zaimukts are trying to get rid of them. Mulla Mahmud Akhunzada has left for his home in Mamuzai country. Kohat Pass Afridis behaving well; they have brought in two rifles taken to Pass by deserters of 2/26th Punjabis, and three rifles have been brought in from Kohat Pass by men of Tochi Militia. Donald has cancelled his invitation to Orakzai jirga to come to Hanga on account of cholera. He reports Mullah Mahmud&apos;s departure has relieved Orakzai situation and tribesmen are glad of any excuse to go home. Some raiding in (? Kohat District). All quiet in Tirah proper, also among Mohmands and kindred tribes. Nawab of Dir writes that he has "imposed fine of 500 upon any one of his people who mentions word Jehad. Swat, Buner, Black Mountain quiet; Hazara normal. Individuals and small bands of Mujahidin are leaving Samasta for Chamarkand disgusted with fanaticism of Amir&apos;s policy. Latter seems to be keeping his word and controlling his colony to the best of his ability. Representatives of jirga asked to be allowed to see Political Agent, Kurram, on 8th June and said they would consent to any penalty. Donald has had satisfactory interview with Kohat Pass Afridis. Orakzai are discussing sending in jirga. Reports from various sources (? show that) Afghan officials and General are still issuing ammunition to tribesmen on large scale, also that Mullahs and Afghan agents are trying bard to prevent dispersal of lashkar but without much success. They are saying Afghans will again attack on or before Id. Khyber reports all quiet Tirah (corrupt group) raiding parties on Peshawar border."

Following from Chief Political Officer, Waziristan, dated 9th June:-

"There are persistent rumours at Khirgi that an Afghan regular force has occupied Wana. According to information received from several sources and Tochi, General Shahwali has advanced to Inzar Kach across the Durand line (corrupt group) distributing ammunition to the Madda Khel. Agents of Qazi Shah Buzurg are attempting to prevent Wazir lashkar from dispersing and they have succeeded in detaining Saidgi and Bermal Waziris. Most of Mahsuds have gone back and Wano Agents of Waziri wish to follow their example. If feasible General Officer Commmanding proposes to send an aeroplane to Wano to ascertain if it is held by Afghans or not."
