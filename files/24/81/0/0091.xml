151WAR CABINETSecret,SHORTAGE OF BESR AJJD SPIRITS.G.T.7491.June 12th 1919.Respected SirFor some time there has &quot;been letters passing betweenthe Shop Stewards of the Midlands and the Uorth.     The rank and file are sick and tired of the Government pro-uses tomodify liquor control v/ith the idea of taking it off altogether at an early date.   At Easter 2 men were chosen to start from Sutton and walk to Aston a distance of 5 - 6 miles, they started at 6.30 and not a spot of Beer or whisky could they obtain, some houses being closed altogether.   The day the King came to Bir-mingham two mere of our men tried with the same result.   There wore meetings among the men and talks of a strike but wiser councils prevailed as at that period a further output of Beer and spirits were promised so that it was left for the matter to be decidedlater on and the matter was put off till this Whitsuntide with the following result, two men called at twenty licensee houses asking tor a bottle of whisky in every case they were refused.Two men walked from Aston to Sutton without obtaining a glass of Alcoholic refreshment,   They found &quot;the Stores&quot; a Beerhouse in Boldmere Road and a full licensed house called the &quot;Gate&quot;entirely closed,  (they are both clo&apos;se to Sutton Park entrance) the &quot;.&apos;ylde Green Hotel also was entirely closed.   The men are sick and tired of unfulfilled promises and are un^er the impression that their leaders are being bribed by the Government.    The pro-posals for a strike are for the Restoration of rights as before the war and they are adding really as an afterthought the raising of Income tax exemption to  250.0.0,      There is a very bitter feeling among the men and unless something is done at once there will certainly be trouble the men being dissatisfied at both the
452 ilquality and quantity of both Beer and whisky particularly. It vill have a most disastrous offoot on tho new loan many of tho man&apos;?lodging themselves net to invest a penny in it until their right. - are restored.   I :m a shop steward in one of the largest Dnginoering norfcs in the Midlands so obviously I cannot sign my nemo, but I can assure von the /natter is very grave, and a&apos;strike oneo started vill extend vith feroat rapidity. This is the reason I heve taken the liberty of addressing you.(Signed)   Shop Steward.
