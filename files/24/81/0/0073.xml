ftAdmiralty Memorandum for the War Cabinet*It will be remembered that the Committee presided over &quot;by Admiral Sir Martyn Jerrain was strongly in favour of extending the improved rates of Naval Pension to all Pensioners on the rolls.    The Committee pointed out that there was evidence to show that Pensioners who had formerly &quot;been comparatively well-off are now in very reduced circumstances, and enclosed a petition on the subject signed &quot;by over 10,000 Naval Pensioners,The Board of Admiralty, while agreeing with the,, opinion of the Committee and recommending that the case of these men in view of their past services&quot;should receive the most favourable consideration of which the circumstances admit, recognised that the question of applying the improved scales to Pensioners other than theso who&apos; have served &quot; during the war and future Pensioners raised issues which &apos; could&quot;not be confined to the Navy alone.The War Cabinet felt unable to approve of the application of the new scales to existing Pensioners- other than those who have served during the wafcIt is a matter of common knowledge that there is a strong feeling in favour of this decision being reconsidered, and at a meeting of representatives of the Lower&quot;Deck in London on the  ftth May a resolution was passed urging that the Government should meet their request, .While tho Board of Admiralty do not consider that it can be contended that the Old Naval Pensioners have the same claims as men at present serving or who have served during the war and realised that Old Naval pensioners cannot be given preferential treatment over retired Naval and Military &quot;Officers. Army Pensioners and Pensioners of all other Government Departments, they are strongly of the opinion that something should be done to ameliorate tho conditions under which such pensioners in maiiy cases have to live, owing to the decreased purchasing power of money.The Admiralty therefore urge that the War. Cabinet should consider the question of increasing the pensions of all Government pensioners &quot;by a percentage rate to be fixed by the Government after full&quot; consideration of the circumstances.(Sdc) JLH.
