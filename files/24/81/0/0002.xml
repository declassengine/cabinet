H&apos;3 3ri&apos;::w)n\.......: L,, jbLnX.&quot; 0 P 6 Pt.y OT        /fveri&apos;3 menViceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 3rd June 1.9] 9. (Received .1. pan.) Clear line.Secret. Afghanistan. We are transmitting the following letter to Amamilla with all possible despatch.   It should leave our lines to-morrow :-,&quot; 1 have received your letter dated 28th May and learn with pleasure that you are now sincerely anxious for a cessation of hostilities and the renewal of the friend-ship between our Governments. For as your envoy was told, nothing could be more entirely opposed to traditional policy and sentiment of the Government of India than war with Afghanistan.&quot; I cannot, however, pass by in silence your allegation that what has happened is due to an unfortunate misunderstanding. There has been no misunderstanding on my part. If there has been any misunderstanding on yours it was a misunder-stancling of the political-situation in India of which you were completely misinformed and a misunderstanding of the temper and power of the British Government. Let me state the facts clearly in order that there may be no doubt as to the responsibility for this war.&quot; On 3rd May, Zar Shah, a notorious frontier marauder, brought a tribal gathering to the frontier near Landi Kotal and killed five coolies on our waterworks. 1 He gave out openly that your Sipah Salar had sent him ahead to commence hostilities and produced a firman under your seal in support of his assertion. On the 4tli May a party of 100 Afghan regulars, 200 Kharsadars and some Shinwari tribesmen occupied Bagh. and Kafir Kot and cut off one of the water supplies of our frontier post at Landi Kotal. On 5th May two guns and three regiments arrived at Bagh and 300 to 400 regulars occupied Tor Sappar and Spina-Suka. By 8th May about 4,000 men and 8 guns were holding positions stretching from Tor Sappar to Bagh, further invading unquestionable British territory, while large reinforcements were held in readiness at Dakka. On 1.1th May my troops ejected your army by force of arms from British territory.&quot;The causes of the war are revealed in your own admissions. You admit in your present letter that you sent troops to the frontiers. You admit in your letter of 10th May that you roused the Afghan tribes. In the same letter you admit the authenticity of the inflammatory firman circulated by your commandant among the tribes to the effect that the loyalty of our Indian subjects had been rewarded by cruelty and injustice in connection with religion, honour and modesty ; and winding up with an incitement to the Jehad. And finally in your present letter you admit that a proclamation of the Jehad was actually on the eve of publication. ;&quot; Even at the eleventh hour, after British territory had been wantonly and deliberately violated, I sought, as the friend of your late lamented father, to furnish his son who, had only just come to the throne, with an honourable retreat from the inevitable consequences of these foolish actions. I invited you to arrest Zar Shah, who in violated British territory had announced that your Sipah Salar had sent him ahead to British territory to commence hostilities. And I invited you to repudiate as a forgery the inflammatory firman which had been distributed broadcast along our common frontier.&quot; To my sorrow you refused the hand of forgiveness and friendship thus extended to you. In your letter of 10th May you said that Zar ShahAs arrest would be inadvisable ; and so far from, repudiating the firman you affirmed its authenticity and even sought to justify it.&quot;The fact is that clays before first shot was fired plans were laid in Kabul for a deliberate attack upon the British Government. Of the many proofs in my hands I will refer you to one document only-letter dated 27th Rajab 1337 (corresponding to 29th April 1919) from your Commissary for. Foreign Affairs to your Envoy, Simla, ordering him to obtain deeds of allegiance from the Hiudus and Muhammadans of India, to put excitement into the Indian newspapers because a good opportunity was drawing near, and to keep in touch with the Commander-in-Chief and the War Minister and Sardar Muhammad Nadir Khan.&quot;In spite, however, of ample justification for carrying this war to its logical conclusion, I am anxious to meet your overtures in a friendly spirit. In this 1 am actuated partly by a knowledge of your youth and inexperience, partly by a knowledge that you have been misinformed and led astray, and because I share your desire to
avoid further useless bloodshed. Moreover, I am not unmindful of our obligations to your father, the Siraj Ul Millat Wa Udin (on whom be peace), who was not only a . faithful friend and ally to the British but also a great patriot. Intense love of his country, coupled with wise statesmanship, led him, in the face of much opposition, to restrain his country from plunging into great war-to her certain ruin. Respect for his memory prompts me to deal as leniently as possible with the country and the people he so loved.&quot; To this end my Government are prepared at once to agree to an armistice on the following terms  &quot; 1. That you should at once withdraw all your troops from the frontier. No Afghan troops are to be located within 20 miles of the nearest British force.&quot; 2. That the British troops should remain where they now are in Afghan territory with freedom to continue such military preparations and precautions as may be deemed necessary. The troops will, however, take no offensive action whatever so long as the terms of this armistice are observed by your side. , &apos;-. .&quot; 3. British aircraft will not bomb or machine-gun Afghan localities or forces so long as the armistice is observed, but they will have freedom of movement in the air to reconnoitre and;observe positions of Afghan forces in order to ensure against any concentration or collection of Afghan troops in, or tribesmen in, contravention of the armistice, further, that you undertake that your people will not fire upon or molest British aircraft and will return without/delay unhurt British aircraft and airmen who may havebeen forced to land in Afghan limits, and to use your utmost endeavour to ensure.  .     safety of any British airmenwho may be forced to land in tribal territory.&quot; 4. That you should at once send urgent messages to the tribes both on your own side and on our side of Durand frontier into whose limits your troops have advanced, or who have been excited by your agents, and please send, immediately stating that, you have asked Government of India for a cessation of hostilities, and that you will not countenance further aggressive action on their part against the British Government; if they take such action it will be at their own risk, and they will receive no support from you, and find no asylum in Afghanistan from which they will be ejected if they come.&quot;Now, my friend, I would ask you to consider these terms carefully, and you will realise how very lenient they are. I ask for no surrender of guns or forts. I avoid all humiliating conditions. If you are wise, you will, accept them in friendly spirit in which they are offered. If you do not accept them the consequences must rest with you. And in all friendliness, let me point out to you that, with the unlimited resources of the British Empire, which has just issued triumphantly from a struggle with the greatest military power the world has ever seen, those consequences can only mean one thing.&quot;If you accept terms offered, orders will at once be issued accordingly to the British General Officers Commanding operations, Avho will be authorised to arrange meetings with Officers Commanding- your troops and to sign armistice agreements to the above effect, awaiting further developments thereafter. I shall gladly appoint selected officers to meet officers selected by you to discuss and arrange final terms of peace and once more to establish and strengthen friendly relations between the [corrupt group] two Governments. As regards a place of meeting, I do not consider either Landi Kotal or Peshawar are suitable places for negotiations of this kind. I have fixed upon Rawal Pincli though not on the (? word omitted) is sufficiently near to be convenient. In the meantime I should be glad, to know the names and designations of the delegates whom you propose to send and the earliest date on which they can reach the frontier. I agree with you that the earlier action is taken in this matter, the better it will be for both parties.&quot; You may rely on there being no delay on my side. -&quot; I earnestly hope that I shall very shortly receive such a reply from you as will pave the way to a renewal of old friendship between our Governments.&quot;&quot;(Signed)     Chelmsford.&quot;
