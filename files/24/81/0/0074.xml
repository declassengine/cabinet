in about a fortnight and the remainder in a further fortnight; and (b) that a scheme on similar lines should be arranged between the two Departments in regard to all surplus stores outside the United Kingdom, Including those situated in the various theatres of war...1 have not been able to- agree to these proposals. In the first place, I cannot accept the view that the arrangement referred to under (1) above was merely a transitional measure.     If this had been tho intention, this ought to have been made perfectly clear at the time, In ox*der that the Ministry might have taken steps to organise machinery and personnel to replace those provided by the War Office.    So far from any such intention having been indicated, the ;,rmy. Council Instruction 304 of 1913 (copy enclosed) which,, as Mr. Churchill states, embodied the arrangement in question,   and which was only issued as recently as the 8th of last month, contains no hint that the directions which It promulgates on the subject are of a temporary or provisional nature,Nor can I agree that the storage,, handling,, and conservation pending disposal,, of property which has been &quot;purchased and imported into the theatres of war for military purposes can be regarded as a purely civilian dut? or one for which the War Office can properly repiidlate responsibility,-On&apos; the other hand,, I fully appreciate the reluctance of the War, Off ice. to &apos;dolay indefinitely the process of demo bill-sation for the. purpose of carrying out these duties, and I should be ready to admit that when the arrangement&apos; was made soon after the Armisticethe immense difficulties of the problem were not fully realised,,nor was it foreseen that Progress in. disposing of the stores in Prance would be so seriously decayed by the attitude of the French Government. J also concur, with Mr., Churchill as to th-s advantages from a(2)
41financial point of view, wore suoh a course practicable, of the authority which is responsible for deciding between the policy of rapid sale and that of retention in order to secure a higher pricej being also responsible for defraying the expenditure incurred through such retention; though I think these advantages would be outweighed by the extravagance and administrative inconvenience of setting up side by side in each theatre of war two virtually duplicate organisations, one responsible for handling, guarding and moving stores up to the time at which they were declared surplus, and the other for carrying out the same finctions after that time.The question arises mainly in regard to the surplus stores in France and .3clguum and the other theatreo of war; for as regards stocks in Parks and Collecting Stations at home the Ministry is quite ready, as was stated in the letter to the War Office of the 22nd ultimo, to confer with the !7ar Office with a view to the early reduction of the military personnel employedoAs regards the theatres of war, it is, I think, obvious that it would under present circumstances be quite impossible for the Ministry to improvise as short notiee the necessary machinery and personnel for carrying out the executive and administrative duties connected with the handling, sorting, inventorying, storing, and guarding of the vast and widely-distributed quantities of stores involved, and it is very doubtful in any case whether this work could bo effectively dealt with, in countries like France and jBelgium, by civilian personnel, Possibly the difficulty of the War Office regarding delay in demobilisation might be  /partly met by offering special inducement to men who would otherwise be.demobilised to volunteer to extend their service for this special employment, and also by securing as large a body of local labour as possible for the same purpose. In addition, the War Office would no doubt have to retain oompul-compulsorily (if necessary, with some compensation in the form of(3)
additional pay), a certain number of specially-qualified officers (and &quot;possibly also of lower ranks) who are already dealing with tHe work and who could not readily be replaced.    The expense of&apos; any special measures of this kind might I think reasonably fall upon the Ministry of Munitions.Any such measures, however, would be merely palliative, . and it is not likely that they would enable the &quot;existing military personnel (other than those induced to volunteer as suggested above) to be entirely relieved of the duties they at present perform in connection vdth surplus stores.     3ut were the War Cabinet to sanction Mr.   &quot;Churchill !s proposal.for the complete withdrawal of that personnel at short notice before satisfactory arrangements could be made for their replacement, a condition of administrative chaos would result which would lead to the virtual abandonment of immense quantities of public stores, and to public criticism of the&apos; severest kind which It would be impossible to meetaI am   of course fully alive to the importance of expediting by every possible means the work of disposal in Prance and the other theatres of war, and I have made proposals to the Treasury and the Foreign Office for an arrange::..mt on a wholesale scale with the French Govt- which if it can be satisfactorily carried through will I hope considerably simplify the problem so far as that country is concerned,14,6,19. lilVERFCRTH.
