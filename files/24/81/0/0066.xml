OjMKgNITROGEN PRODUCTS COMMITTEE.04The following memorandum summarizes the principal matters dealt with in the attached Report of the fitrogen Products Committee of the Munitions Inventions ^Department,APPOINTMENT AND TERMS OF REFERENCE.The Committee was appointed in June 1916 &quot;by Mr. Lloyd George, then Minister of Munitions, to consider the question of establishing in this country and in other . parts of the Empire seme of the newer processes for fixing atmospheric nitrogen, in order to provide supplies of the nitrogen compounds essential for munitions and agriculture. The Committee was also required to carry out experimental in-vestigations of suoh processes as appeared to be of utility. The Committee was composed of Members nominated by Government Departments and by the principal Scientific Societies and of other leading scientific and industrial specialists.The constitution of the Committee and the full terms of reference are given on pp. 1 and 2 of the Report.INTERIM REPORT.In Feb. 1917 the Committee submitted an Interim Report containing proposals for increasing the home production of nitrogen compounds for military and agricultural purposes. Among other matters, the Committee recommended :(a)(b)The establishment on a large scale of one of the well-known nitrogen fixation processes, namely, the calcium cyanamide process.The establishment on a substantial scale of the ammonia oxidation process for obtaining nitric acid the
practicability of which had been demonstrated by rese&amp;roh work,(c) The erection of a full size trial unit for testing the synthetic ammonia (Haber) process which had been shown by the research work -co hold out very great&apos;promise.An abstract of the Interim Report and the Minister1s decisions thereon, and of the subsequent action is given in Append ix I pp. 140-148.For various reasons it was not considered possible to proceed with the erection cf a factory for the calcium oyansmlde process as recommended*    On the other hand, the engineers of the Explosives Department considered that the stage reached in the research work on the synthetic ammonia process warranted the erection of a factory for the manufacture of synthetio ammonia and ammonium nitrate.As the outcome of an alternative proposal put forward by that Department in October 1917, a commencement was made with the Factory at Billingham for the fixation of nitrogen by the Haber process.The Final Report is divided into a number of sections In which the various aspects of the nitrogen problem are reviewed in detail.Section 13 (pp,, 120-133) contains a summary of the Committeers conclusions and also general observations upon the matters dealt with in the preceding sections e Review of pre -war po si tion.In a preliminary statement, the Committee emphasises the fundamental importance of nitrogenous fertilisers and the essential need of various nitrogen pro&amp;u3fcs for the manifao truro of munitions and for important industries,        A general indication is given of the relation between the older and
newer methods or processes for obtalDir^&quot;nitrogercprod]iici^With regard to the nitrogen industries before the Wr^ it is shown that the demand doubled 3u the ten years 1903-191&amp; (p.19).   Practically the Yfaole of the world*s demand was met by the Chile nitrate and by-products ammonia industries.   &apos; The output of synthetic nitrogen products was relatively insigni-fleant in spite of the notable developments of nitrogen fixation during the pre-war period (p.19).The Heport then deals with the pre-war position of the United Ziag&amp;om, which was a very large producer of by-product ammonia but a relatively small consumer of all forms of combined nitrogen.   The bulk of the home production of by-product ammonia was exported in the form of ammonium sulphate, but the country was entirely dependent upon imports for the nitrates required in agriculture and essential industries, such as the explosives industry.Power production for nitregen fixation. After indicating the power requirements of the various nitrogen fixation processes, and pointing out the importance of the cost of power as a factor in some of the processes, the Committee malce a detailed investigation of the question of obtaining large supplies of cheap power for nitrogen fixation in the United Kingdom.The production of power from coal is first dealt with, and an estimate is given of the cost of its generation in bulk by modern steam turbo-electric plant.Consideration is then given to the important question whether it is possible to cheapen the cost of electric power by submitting the coal to distillation and gasification pro-cesses, such as low temperature carbonisation., as a pre 11m-kinary to power production, in order to conserve ammonia and other by-products.   This aspect of power production is dealt with exhaustively in Appendix IV,p.159-217.    A, review is
also given of the Committee1 s enquiry into the prospects of obtaining cheap water power in the. United Kingdom, ana of utilising peat for power production with ammonia recovery.The Committees conclusions (p,43-45) point to water-power development as the cheapest source of power on a sufficiently large scale.   It is also shown that in the present state of knowledge, the application of carbonisation and other processes to power production in bulk offers no immediate prospect of reducing the cost of electrical energy from coal below the figures attainable by direct coal firing.   High prices of coal and high rates of wages are a handicap to all by-product power schemes (p.lE8) and the Reports clearly indicates,limiting prices of coal beyond which recovery schemes are unable to compete financially with direct firing.Costs of established processes.The Committee has critically examinee! the costs of the established synthetic and non-synthetic processes and has prepared a reasoned estimate of the capital expenditure and working costs involved in operating them in the United Kingdom.     The costs are summarised in Tables 35 and 36 (pp.55 and 56).The Committees conclusions under this head )p.59) indicate that synthetic fertilisers such as ammonium sulphate and cyanmide, and also synthetic nitric acid can be produced at a cost, at the factory, which shows to very substantial advantage as compared with the pre-war market price of Chile nitrate and by-product ammonium sulphate,Rosearnhes raidertateen.A summary is given (p.64-70) of the research work carried out under the direction of the Committee.     Important results have been achieved in connection with the synthesis of ammonia, the manufacture and purification of hydrogen, the oxidation of ammonia to nitric acid, and the production of synthetic nitrates. The result of the experimental and. trial work formed the basis
znof the scheme-prepared by- the:3spXoalTies-&apos;I)eparfcat^f or the national nitrate factory at Eillingham.Eff ect^cf the twar onjaLty-ogeri. industries and;.,oja Jfatur e^ policy,On account of the war demand, the bulk cf the world1 s supplies of nitrogen products have been diverted from agriculture, to the. manufacture if explosives *    Statistics are given showing the expansion during the last ;four years of the Chile nitrate, by-product ammonia, and nitrogen fixation industries, and a review of the war position in Germany and in the United Kingdom follows.5n Germany, which was the world1 s largest eons-miner of Chile nitrate before the war, the blockade and the enormous war demands have resulted not only in a large expansion of her by-product ammonia industry bub in a very remarkable development of nitrogen fixation.     The estimated output of nitrogen products in .1917 was about three times her production in 1913... In. -the United Kingdom, on the contrary, the home production of by-product ammonia remained practically stationary, and the country has depended entirely upon imports of Chile nitrate for the mamufactore of munitions (pp. 77-8).The Committee eortrats   the position of a country relying upon imported nitrates with that of one depending upon fixation processes principally as regards costs and shipping requirements (p.78-80)0   It concludes that considerations of national safety, of finance, and. cf utility would alike force a country to resort in futrre to the policy of &amp;oopting synthetic methods as en insurance against emergencies instead of placing reliance upon the importation of Chile nitrate.
Post-war aepccrta of the nitrogen problem.Consideration is given to the economic conditions confronting the world1 s nitrogen industries and to Inter-national competition.The Committee concludes that in spite of the great expansion of the nitrogen fixation   in&amp;industry during the war, over production is hardly likely to constitute a serious factor in.the post war situation (p*l 0)o      Moreover, the demand for nitrogenous fertilisers is already considerably in excess 01 the pre-war consumption, antt there will probably be ample scope in the post-war markets for both synthetic and non-synthetic products,,      The Synthetic processes are also likely to super-sede Chile nitrate as the scarce of Citric acid, but their position as regards the manufactore of artificial nitrates at a competitive price is more doubtful.Requirements and Resourees jof^fee United Kingdom.The Committee in a reasoned estimate shows that the present demands for nitrogen products for agriculture and industry in the United Kingdom are already more than double the,pre-war demand and that the needs in the near future will be s till greateraThe Committee considers that the maintenance of a large export trade in nitrogenous fertilisers should be an essential feature of postwar policy, since only in this manner could an economic use be found during peace time for an adequate reserve of plant for a futare war emergency..With regard&apos;to the possibility of r endering the United Kingdom self-supporting in nitrogen products, the Committee reviews the prospects^of the coal distillation industries, of low temperature carbonization, and of the recovery of ammonia
from shale, psat and sewage, (p.96-106 and Appendix III. p,149-166),It is concluded, howevsr, that while much could bo done Ay the. extension and development of ammonia wcovery processes, a policy directed towards ultimate independence of imported nitrogen products would essentially involve the establishment in this country of nitrogen filiation on a large scale (p.105).&quot;Even if complete independence in peace time is not attempted, the Committee is emphatically of the opinion that in the light )f the lessons learned during the war tlae national interests demand ;he establishment forthwith of nitrogen fixation and allied processes rpon a considerable manufacturing scaleeNitrogen fixation in the British Empire...The Committee deals with the nitrogen problem in Australia, Canada, gypt, India, New Zealand, and South Africa, and comes to the conclusion Hat it would be practicable to make the British Bap ire during war and eaoe independent of external supplies of nitrogen produci-s.The Committee emphasises the fundamental ehaage in the Llitary situation that has been brought about by the commercial(velopment of. nitrogen fixation processes, and points out that this country cannot afford tho risk of dependence upon Chile in the iture.     It is urged that Imperial preparedness for defence is one of the tal problems to be faced, and should not be made subservient to immercial or demesne requirements.       The Committee advocates thatImperial Authority shoiufc make a careful&apos; study of the defensive require-bts of the Empire so as to decide which locations are most suitable t the establishment of the installation required to provide 3 necessary supplies (p0L19).
SUMEfiSY OF CONCLUSIONS.The principal conclusions arrived at by the Committee are summarised on p* 120*133,f     roximrMTioNs,The Committees recommendations are given on p. 133-137 and are stmimarise^. below:-f^^   Provision for national safety.The following measures are recommenced as a minimum provision for safeguarding the future and for meeting a portion of the growing home demand for various nitrogen products: -The establishment without delay of the calcium cyanamide process on a scale sufficient to give an output of about 60,000 tons of cyanamide per aontaa;     This should be drne either by private enterprise (sitpporte^ if necessary by the Government) or as a public work, and the necessary electrical energ-y should be obtained either from water power in Scotland of from one of the proposed large steam power stations.She establishment fortieth of the synthetic ammonia process on a commieial uait scale and its expansion aa rapidly as&apos; possible to a minimum manufacturing scale of 10.,000 tons of ammonia per annum,     Tho CommiVsee recommends that the Billinghom factory should bo utilised for the purpose is such a course is practicable.The establishment cf the ammonia oxidation process cn a scale sufficient to produce shout 10,000 tons of stiour rii tic acid per annum or its equivalent in nitrates*By-product ammonia industries *-Various proposals are made for conserving and increasing the output of by-product ammonia from gas-works, coke ovens, etc., for securing the better utilisation-tion of the national resources in coal, and for reducing the consumption of raw coal as fuel.      It is recommended(a)(b)(o)(2)
inthat the Local Government Board be given wider powers in this connection,(iii) Tria^p^eratipns and re*gearch*Tho trial on a works scale of vs-serious promising processes for the fixation or recovery of nitrogen is advocated,, and the Committee also recommends that the researches on the nitrogen problem initiated during the war should be continued after under the auspices of the Government for the general benefit of the country*   Further, that the results of the researches carried out up to the present date should be edited and published at the earliest possible moment.(iv) imperial suppliesaThe Committee recommend that a co-ordinated policy should be framed for safeguarding the future nitrogen requirements of the F/empire, and suggest that Advisory Bodies should be 3et up in the various parts of the Empire to furnish the Imperial Authority with the requisite data0(v) 0bher ^recommendations *Among additional recommendations, the Committee advocates the official collection and publication of comprehensive statistics for the nitrogen industries of the United Kingdom,, and for the home consumption of coal by various classes of users and industriesa The Committee suggests that the question of statistics is also worthy of the attention of the Overseas Governments *
Nitrogen fixation will.constitute a new &quot;Key&quot; industry, and the Ccimittee is of the opinion that its initation and development will require the active support of the Government*11/6/19.I.

FINAL REPORT OF THE NITROGEN PRODUCTSCOMMITTEE.To theRight Honourable Lord Inverfortii, Minister of Munitions of War.My Lord,We, the Nitrogen Products Committee of the Munitions Inventions Department, have the honour to report as follows :-1. The Nitrogen Products Committee was appointed in June 1916, with the sanction of the Right Hon. D. Lloyd George, M.P., then Minister of Munitions, as a Committee of the Advisory Panel of the Munitions Inventions Department to deal with the matters comprised in the following terms of reference : To consider the relative advantages for this country and for the Empire of the various methods for the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen, from the point of view both of warand peace purposes; to ascertain their relative costs, and to advise on proposalsrelevant thereto which may he submitted to the Department. To examine into the supply of the raw materials required, e.g., pure nitrogen andhydrogen, and into the utilisation of the by-products obtained. Since some of the processes employed depend for their success on the provision oflarge supplies of cheap power, to ascertain where and how this can best be obtained. To consider what steps can with advantage be taken to conserve and increase the national resources in nitrogen-bearing compounds and to limit their wastage. To carry out the experimental work necessary to arrive at definite conclusions as tothe practicability and efficiency of such processes as may appear to the Committee tobe of value.As a result of the foregoing steps, to advise as to starting operations on an industrial scale.2. For reasons which are mentioned later, the Committee found it necessary to interpret the terms of reference in a liberal manner. The enquiry has in consequence been of very wide scope, embracing practically a detailed examination of the nitrogen problem in its relation to the military, agricultural and industrial requirements of the United Kingdom and other parts of the British Empire. The official representation of the Government Departments directly concerned with these questions has materially aided the work of the Committee.3.. As the subject admitted of sub-division into a number of broad fields of investigation, the Committee, in order to utilise the special qualifications and experience of its members to the best advantage, appointed the following Sub-Committees with powers to recommend the co-option of additional members : (a) The Processes Sub-Committee, to report upon methods and processes for the production of synthetic and non-synthetic nitrogen compounds and upon the approximate costs of manufacture ;(b) The Power and Gas-firing Sub-Covimittees, to report upon the prospects of obtaining electrical energy at a sufficiently low cost for the operation of nitrogen fixation processes under British conditions, and upon the collateral problems of conserving and increasing the national resources in nitrogen products derivable from* fuel used for poAver production or other purposes ; .(c) The Economics Sub-Committee, to report upon the economic aspects of the nitrogen problem;(d) The Experiments Sub-Committee, to supervise the practical investigations demanded by some of the newer processes for obtaining nitrogen compounds ; and(e) The General Purposes Sub-Committee, to co-ordinate the work of the other Sub-Committees, to advise on policy, and to draft the Final Report.A research section was at once organised by the Munitions Inventions Department, and steps were taken to secure laboratory accommodation of the ample character needed for the conduct of the research programme in; contemplation. Through the cordial attitude of the Provost and professorial staff of University College, London, the Department was fortunate in obtaining the use of part of the new Ramsay Laboratory.
FINAL HE PORT.34. At a meeting of the Committee held on October 10th, 1916, the members were -addressed by the Eight Hon. E. S. Montagu, M.P., then Minister of Munitions, who referred to the importance of the questions under investigation, and assured the Committee of his intention, whether still in the Government or not, to give his support to the recommendations that were ultimately made.5. It was realised from the outset that there were two distinct aspects to the enquiry : the war demand for nitrogen products for munitions, and the potential needs of agriculture and industry in the immediate future. The general trend of the preliminary investigations pointed to the conclusion that definite steps, could at once be recommended for augmenting the production of nitrogen compounds in the United Kingdom in the event of the war demand for munitions requiring this to be done.6. In December 1916, the Right Hon. Christopher Addison, M.D., M.P., then Minister of Munitions, requested the Committee to submit practical proposals at an early date, pointing out that while every advantage should be taken of temporary expedients, efforts should be made to promote processes which were likely to be of permanent value to the country.7. The Committee accordingly submitted to the Minister on February 22nd, 1917, an Interim Report, the conclusions and recommendations set out therein being unanimously endorsed by the members. These recommendations and the action subsequently taken upon them have so close a connection with the final conclusions and recommendations of the Committee that it has been considered necessary to incorporate with the present Report a summary of the Interim Report and an account of the action taken upon it.   (See Appendix I.)8. The subsequent investigations required to complete the enquiry were necessarily of a protracted character, involving the collection of the most recent and authoritative data . available in each branch of the subject, and the critical examination of all the evidence in the light of published figures and of the practical experience of members of the Committee. The problem was complicated by the fact that nitrogen fixation processes had not been carried out - on a commercial scale in this country, that information concerning the financial aspects and esssential commercial details of some of them had been jealously guarded, and that such economic information as might prove to be obtainable would require to be interpreted in the light of British conditions. Many essential technical details, however, have been revealed by the research work carried out under the direction of the Committee, and it may he noted at this stage that the results of the work have been at the disposal of the Explosives Department and utilised for war purposes.9. Whenever possible, the Committee has obtained information direct from trade associations, from manufacturers, firms, and undertakings engaged in different branches of the nitrogen industry or associated industries, from chemists and engineers who have had actual works&apos; experience of the various synthetic and non-synthetic processes, and from consultants and private individuals with special knowledge of particular branches of the subject. Information, both written and verbal, has been obtained from a very large number, of sources, in many cases on condition that the name of the authority should be withheld from publication. In these circumstances, the publication of a partial list of authorities would be invidious, but the Committee desires to take this opportunity of expressing its appreciation of the valuable assistance afforded by all those who have so willingly placed authoritative information at its disposal.10. The Committee has also been in direct liaison with official delegates of the Governments of France, Italy, Russia, and the United States, and has received much valuable information concerning the general position and recent developments of nitrogen fixation in those countries. Considerable assistance has also been rendered by the Liaison Officer of the Munitions Inventions Department with the corresponding Department of the French War Ministry. Reciprocally, the results of the enquiry and of the research work undertaken by the Committee have been placed freely at the disposal of the Allied Governments. This matter is again referred to in the section of the Report devoted to the question of research.11. With regard to the possibilities of nitrogen fixation in other parts of the British Empire, it was realised that much information concerning local requirements and resources would have to be obtained to permit of a general survey of the question even in the broadest outline. As the result of representations made through the Ministry to the Dominion Governments, and through the assistance of the Colonial Office and India Office, official representatives were nominated by the Governments of the Dominions and of a number of the Crown Colonies and Dependencies to confer directly with the Committee. An abstract of the evidence given by these official representatives and the Committee&apos;s conclusions on this aspect of the nitrogen problem are set out later in the Report.12. In due course reports were submitted by the several Sub-Committees embodying the results of their investigations of the different branches of the problem. Certain other aspects, however, still remained to be explored, and in the course of the further enquiries thus necessitated, information continued to cgme to hand on matters dealt with in the sectional reports.   After a full review of the position&apos;, the Committee came to the conclusion that the
circumstances demanded a Final. Report drawn up on lines somewhat different from those contemplated at an earlier stage. In compiling this Report, which is essentially based upon the, sectional reports, the Committee has endeavoured to present a connected view of the nitrogen problem by utilising the whole of the information that has become available during the enquiry. Adjustments have also been made in some of the figures taken from the sectional, reports where this course has been demanded in the light of more recent data.13. The Committee is required by the terms of reference &quot;to advise as to starting operations upon an industrial scale,&quot; and certain measures which were clearly shown by the early stages of the investigation to be of practical utility for augmenting the home production of munitions were recommended in the Interim Report. Since these recommen-dations were made, the exigencies of the.war situation have been responsible for a fundamental alteration in the status of agriculture in the United Kingdom. The present policy of food production has already had the effect of increasing the home demand for nitrogenous fertilisers to an extent far exceeding the pre-war consumption, and the maintenance of this policy after the war or its further development, as has been advocated in a report recently issued by the Agricultural Policy Sub-Committee of the Reconstruction Committee, is vitally interconnected with the future of the nitrogen industry. It has therefore been necessary to reconsider the adequacy or otherwise of the interim recommendations in the light of the potential needs of the United. Kingdom after the war.14. In order to arrive at the final conclusions and recommendations set out in detail at the end of this Report, the Committee, as previously mentioned, found it necessary to interpret the terms of reference in.a wide sense, seeing that the questions to be decided involved a consideration not, only of the established, and partly-developed nitrogen fixation processes from the point of view of cost and of applicability to British conditions, but also of other factors having an essential bearing upon the issue, such as: methods of obtaining or recovering nitrogen products from natural sources; the relative merits of synthetic and n,on-synthetic products from the standpoints of cost and utility ; the rate of increase in the world&apos;s production of and demand for combined nitrogen before the war; the war develop-ments in the nitrogen industry; and the prospects under post-war conditions. These factors had also to be specially considered in relation to the circumstances of the United Kingdom.15. The Committee has found it most convenient to set out its Report under the following-headings : I, Preliminary Statement.II. The Pre-War Position of the World&apos;s Nitrogen Industries. III.-The Pre-War Position of the United Kingdom. IV. Power Production for Nitrogen Fixation. V. The Economics, of the Established Processes. VI.  Partly-developed Processes and.

The sections dealing with the war and post-war aspects of the nitrogen problem should therefore be read in the light of the fact that the war was still in progress when they were drafted,16, A complete summary of the more essential evidence and information collected and compiled by the Committee and its Sub-Committees is given in the form of Appendices to this Report.   The Appendices, inclusive of that previously referred to, are as follows :  Appendix I. Abstract of the Interim Report: The Action taken.Appendix II.

FINAL REPORT.5I. -PRELIMINARY STATEMENT.18. The fundamental importance of combined nitrogen in agriculture has long been recognised, and the war has served to emphasise its vital bearing in relation to munitions.19. Nitrogen is an essential constituent of all vegetation, and the workVs production of food depends in a large measure upon its application to the soil in the form of nitrogenous manures or fertilisers capable of assimilation by plants and suitable for varying kinds of soil and climate. The natural formation of nitrogenous fertilisers occurs to a small extent owing to the absorption by the soil of the oxides of nitrogen produced by electrical discharges in the atmosphere. The main source of combined nitrogen in nature appears to be the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen direct through the, aid of bacteria either acting alone or in symbiosis with leguminous plants. The amount of combined nitrogen thus rendered available is far from adequate for meeting the food requirements of the world, and as the nitrogen does riot accumulate to any extent in the soil, the question of the world&apos;s supplies of nitrogenous fertilisers is seen to be of the first importance.20. Nitrogen is also an essential constituent of nearly all high explosives and propellants, and of many products which play an important part in industry under normal conditions. Before the war the industrial demand for combined nitrogen was quite small in comparison with the agricultural demand. Under war conditions, however, a very large proportion of the world&apos;s supplies of combined nitrogen has been diverted from agriculture to the pro-d notion of munitions, thus affording a significant lesson as to the extent to which the security of a nation may depend upon its ability to procure or produce an adequate supply of essential nitrogen products.21. Until recent times the principal nitrogenous products or materials available for meeting the world&apos;s demand for fertilisers were nitrate of soda, vast natural deposits of which occur in Chile; ammonium sulphate, obtained as a by-product in the destructive distillation of coal and shale ; farmyard manure, guano, shoddy, and other waste materials of organic origin. The main products used for industrial purposes were Chile nitrate (for the manu-facture of nitric acid), ammonia and ammonium salts, Cyanides (in the gold-mining industry), and potassium nitrate. The continuous increase in the world&apos;s demand and the constant upward trend of the price of combined nitrogen have led to the invention and development of processes for fixing atmospheric nitrogen, thus opening up a practically unlimited source of supply.22. Nitrogen gas constitutes about 75 per cent, by weight of the atmosphere, and it is calculated that the air over a single square mile of land contains about 20 million tons, equivalent to about 30 times the quantity of combined nitrogen contained in the world&apos;s pro-duction of Chile nitrate and ammonium sulphate in the year 1913. Nitrogen in the gaseous or uncombined form is one of the most inert of the elements, and may be said to have no commercial value. The position, however, is very different when nitrogen is suitably fixed or combined with other elements, and thus rendered available for agriculture and industry.23. The history of nitrogen fixation dates back to the early years of the nineteenth century, when numerous attempts were made, both in this country and elsewhere, to manu-faclure cyanides and ferro-cyanides by fixing atmospheric nitrogen with the aid of mixtures of carbon and alkalies or alkaline earths heated to an elevated temperature (Appendix V., Section X.). Although such cyanide processes have hitherto failed lo attain to commercial success, important results have accrued from the researches undertaken in connection Avith them, the study of the behaviour of metallic carbides towards nitrogen gas being directly responsible for the technical development of the calcium cyanamide process (Appendix V., Sections V. and X.). In the meanwhile, the work of Sir William Crookes and Lord Rayleigh in this country some twenty years ago had first directed attention to the possibility of utilising the electric arc for effecting the direct oxidation of atmospheric nitrogen on a technical scale for the production of nitric acid (Appendix V., Section III.). As the result of the progress made in this field of investigation, the arc process was the first of the modern nitrogen fixation processes to be established on a commercial basis, being followed a few years later by the calcium cyanamide process referred to above. The third of the established fixation processes resulted from the researches of Haber and others upon the synthesis of ammonia from hydrogen and nitrogen at elevated pressures and temperatures by the action of catalysts, and was brought into commercial operation in Gennany in the year prior to the war (Appendix V., Section IV.). In addition to the three established, processes just mentioned, many other methods of fixing atmospheric nitrogen have been tried and the more important of these are dealt with on page 60 of the Report. ^24. It does not appear that any new methods of fixing atmospheric nitrogen have been discovered during the past five or six years, but important technical advances leading to economy in manufacture have been made in some of the established processes, and as a direct outcome of the enormous Avar demand for fixed nitrogen, developments on a very extensive scale have occurred since the outbreak of Avar.
25. The principal processes^ in operation or proposed for the manufacture of the more-important nitrogen products admit of a simple classification as follows :-By-product Ammonia Processes.-The combined nitrogen contained in coal, shale, peat, sewage and other matters of organic origin can be recovered in part in the &quot;form of ammonia or ammonium sulphate in processes such as those involving the carbonisation of coal, the distillation of shale, the complete gasification of coal or peat with the aid of steam, or the distillation of concentrated sewage (Appendices III. and TV. and Appendix V., Sections II., XIII, and XIV.).The Retort Process. Before the development of the processes mentioned below for obtaining nitric acid from atmospheric nitrogen or from ammonia, the standard method of manufacturing this product was by the treatment of Chile nitrate with strong sulphuric acid by the well-known retort process (Appendix V., Section I). The process, which is still largely used, is a simple one enabling strong nitric acid to be directly produced, but a proportion of the acid radical of the sulphuric acid employed goes to waste in the acid sodium sulphate or nitre cake constituting the by-product of the process. It may be noted that the nitric acid obtained by this method or by any of those referred to below can be utilised for the manufacture of nitrates, such as ammonium or calcium nitrate, by neutralising the acid with an appropriate base.Nitrogen Fixation Processes. By these processes, atmospheric nitrogen is caused to enter into direct combination with other elements or compounds, such as atmospheric oxygen, metals, metallic carbides or other metallic compounds, and hydrogen.(a) The direct union of atmospheric nitrogen and oxygen can be effected by means of the electric arc (Arc process, Appendix V., Section III.), the silent electric discharge,, and by the combustion of fuel products at high temperatures (Hausser and Bender Processes, Appendix V., Sections IX. and XII.). The primary products in all these cases consist of oxides of nitrogen, which are usually recovered as dilute nitric acid by absorption in water, the acid being subsequently concentrated if required in that form.(b) Other nitrogen compounds are obtained by the action of atmospheric nitrogen at an elevated temperature upon a metallic carbide, such as calcium carbide (Calcium cyanamide process, Appendix V., Section V.), upon a metal or a metallic oxide mixed with carbon, such as aluminium oxide (Serpek process, Appendix V., Section XI), or upon an alkali or alkaline earth mixed with carbon (Cyanide processes, Appendix V., Section X.). The primary products in all these cases are solids, namely, calcium cyanamide, a valuable fertiliser, pure or crude metallic nitrides, and crude cyanides respectively. Upon treatment with steam or dilute alkali under proper conditions, the combined nitrogen in all these products is liberated in the form of gaseous ammonia, which can be recovered as pure ammonia liquor or as ammonium sulphate. Alternatively, the crude cyanide products can be worked up for the manufacture of finished cyanides.(c) The direct combination of atmospheric nitrogen and hydrogen is effected by passing a suitably proportioned mixture of the pure gases under high pressure over a catalyst maintained at an elevated temperature (Haber process, Appendix V., Section IV.).. The primary product is ammonia, which can be recovered in the form of pure ammonia liquor or ammonium sulphate.The Ammonia Oxidation Process. -This process provides a method of obtaining nitric acid by the use of ammonia as a raw material, the latter being oxidised in the presence of a catalyst or otherwise by means of air or oxygen gas (Appendix V, Section VII.). The primary product of the processes at present in operation consists of oxides of nitrogen, which are usually recovered in the form of dilute nitric acid by absorption in water, as in the case of the arc process, the acid being concentrated further if desired in that form. If the oxides are absorbed in solutions of alkalies or alkaline earths, the primary products consist of nitrates.26. A general idea of the relationship of the non-synthetic and synthetic processes from the point of view of the manufacture of particular nitrogen products is afforded by Table 1, which summarises the primary and secondary products obtainable by the various methods of recovering or fixing nitrogen.27. Although every one of the above processes is capable of yielding a solid nitrogenous fertiliser, such as ammonium sulphate, calcium cyanamide, or a nitrate, either as a primary or as a secondary product, it is important to note that, of the nitrogen fixation processes, only one,, namely, the calcium cyanamide process, yields a fertiliser directly as a primary product. Further reference is made to this feature of the process on page 48 of the Report.28. Throughout this Report all quantities and costs of nitrogen products are expressed primarily in terms of metric tons of combined nitrogen. [Conversion factors: 1 metric ton (1,000 kg.) = 0&apos;984 long ton of 2,240 lb.; 1 long ton ^ 1*016 metric ton.] This unit is-almost invariably adopted in Continental countries, and enables the costs of various nitrogen compounds to he expressed in terms of a common denominator, thus facilitating direct comparison.   For example:

Nitric Acid or alternatively as Metallic Nitrates.	Concentrated (93-96 per cent.) Nitric Acid or Nitrates such as Am-ammonium or Calcium Nitrate.29. Nitrogenous compounds are usually sold upon the market at so much per unit (ie., 1/100 of a ton) of combined nitrogen, the metric unit being equivalent to 10 kg. or 22 lb., and the British unit to 22&apos;4 lb. of combined nitrogen. The price of a &quot;unit&quot; of nitrogen is therefore the one-hundredth part of the price per ton of combined nitrogen, so that if the selling price of Chile nitrate is equivalent to  67&apos; 2 per metric ton of combined nitrogen, the price of the corresponding &quot;unit&quot; of nitrogen would be  0&apos;672 or 13s. 5d.30. The percentage of combined nitrogen contained in a number of the more important compounds or commercial products, and the corresponding tonnage of compound or product equivalent to one ton of combined nitrogen, are indicated in Table 2.31. The Committee has deliberately adopted pre-war conditions as the only satisfactory basis for dealing with the questions of costs and prices, since it is obvious that the constant fluctuations in the rates of wages and in the prices of materials during the war period render it impossible to arrive at a true comparison of estimates based upon war conditions. This has led to some difficulty in the case of a process like the ammonia oxidation process, which owes its extensive commercial adoption entirely to the war demand for nitric acid, but guidance has been afforded in such a case by manufacturing experience with processes of an analogous character.32. It is specially to be noted tha,t the figures for costs given in the Report (and in Appendix V.) represent the pre-war production costs at the factory, and do not include any allowance for interest on the capital cost of the chemical installations, for the cost of marketing, or for profit, although the cost of electrical energy in all cases is taken as inclusive of capital charges upon the power installation. In order to cover the items just specified, an addition of perhaps 20 or 25 per cent, would have to be made to the factory costs, and this point must be kept in view when contrasting production costs with tlie market prices of products such as(a) If one ton of calcium cyanamide (20 per cent. N.) costs  6, the cost of a ton of combined nitrogen in the form of cyanamide Avould he  30 (i.e., 6 -r 0&apos;20);(b) If one ton of Chile nitrate (15&apos; 65 per cent. N.) costs  10, the cost of a ton of combined nitrogen in the form of Chile nitrate would be  63&apos; 9 ;(c) If one ton of pure ammonia (82 &quot;35 per cent. N.) in the form of ammonia spirit costs  50, the cost of a ton of combined nitrogen in the same form would be  60&apos; 7 ;and so on for other products.Table 1.-NITROGEN&quot; RECOVERY AND FIXATION PROCESSES

The figures are also exclusive of allowances for royalties, licences, or like payments in respect of patent or other rights, although charges of this character would be incurred in connection with the establishment of some of the processes.Table 2.-NITROGEN CONTENT OF THE MORE IMPORTANT PRODUCTS.Compound or Commercial Product.

It has been found convenient, in referring to various nitrogen products from the-point of view of combined nitrogen, to make use of expressions such as &quot; nitrate nitrogen,&quot; &quot; nitric nitrogen,&quot; &quot; ammonia nitrogen,&quot; and so on. This terminology is not strictly accurate-from a scientific standpoint, but serves to avoid the employment of lengthy expressions such as &quot;combined nitrogen in the.form of nitrates,&quot; &quot;combined nitrogen in the form of nitric acid,&quot; and &quot; combined nitrogen in the form of ammonia.&quot;34. There is a great disparity in the demand for different nitrogen products, some products having a much wider utility than others. It will therefore be recognised that the form in which nitrogen is combined is a primary consideration when contrasting the merits-of the various nitrogen recovery and fixation processes from the point of view of the products obtainable thereby. The forms of combined nitrogen dealt with in this Report include those of fundamental importance in connection with agriculture and munitions and others of special, utility in many essential industries.   They may be classified as follows: - (a) Nitrate nitrogen, in the form of Chile nitrate, potassium nitrate, ammonium-nitrate, and calcium nitrate (the so-called nitrate of lime).(b) Ammonia nitrogen, in the form of ammonia, ammonium sulphate, ammoniumt nitrate, and other ammonium salts.(e) Nitric nitrogen, in the form of dilute and concentrated nitric acid.(d) Cyanamide nitrogen, in the form of calcium cyanamide or nitrolim.(e) Cyanide nitrogen, in the form of barium and sodium cyanide.
35. Of the above, ammonia nitrogen and, to a much smaller extent, cyanide nitrogen are the only forms hitherto produced from home resources in the United Kingdom, the whole of ,the requirements in respect of nitrate, nitric and cyanamide nitrogen having been met by the ^importation of nitrogen products.II-THE PRE-WAR POSITION OF THE WORLD&apos;S NITROGEN INDUSTRIES.36. By far the most important sources of the world&apos;s supplies of marketable nitrogen products used in agriculture and industry before the war were the vast natural deposits of -nitrate of soda found in Chile and the ammoniacal by-products obtained in the carbonisation -or destructive distillation of coal and other materials of organic origin. Other naturally occurring nitrogen products, such as potassium nitrate and guano, found applications in industry and agriculture, but the world&apos;s output of these and in fact of all other marketable forms of combined nitrogen was small in comparison with that of Chile nitrate and by-product ammonia.37. The continuous increase in the world&apos;s demand for nitrogenous fertilisers and the general rise in the price of combined nitrogen were responsible for the establishment in many countries of processes for the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen a notable landmark in the development of electro-chemical industries. Notwithstanding the striking position attained by the fixation industry before the outbreak of war, its contribution towards the world&apos;s - supplies of marketable nitrogen products only represented a small fraction of the total.38. The outstanding factors in the nitrogen situation before the war were the Chile nitrate and.the by-product ammonia industries. The success attending nitrogen fixation processes, however, clearly foreshadowed a future modification in the nitrogen situation, as is shown by the general review of these industries given below.THE CHILE NITRATE INDUSTRY.39. Before the war, practically the whole of the world&apos;s requirements in respect of nitrate and nitric nitrogen were met by the exportation of nitrate of soda from Chile, and the price of this product has hitherto governed the market price of combined nitrogen.40. The Chilean nitrate industry is one of long standing and has been characterised by a steady rate of expansion. By the middle of the nineteenth century the exports had attained a figure of about 100,000 tons per annum, whereas the shipments from Chile in the year prior to the war (1913) amounted to over 2,400.000 tons.Output and Market Prices.41. The scale of production during the years 1903-1913 and the corresponding average annual market prices of nitrate in the United Kingdom are set out in the following table, and are also illustrated graphically in an Appendix (Appendix V., Charts C and E): Table 3.-PRE-WAR OUTPUT AND MARKET PRICES OP CHILE NITRATE.Ykak.

10 nitrogen products committee: final report.Cost of Production.! 42. According to authoritative data supplied to the Committee, the pre-war cost of production at a medium-sized modern nitrate factory, including all factory expenses in Chile  such, as labour, fuel, repairs, bagging, freight to a port, shipping charges, and commission  amortisation of the cost of the nitrate grounds and plant, interest on capital at the rate of 5 per cent., and Chilean export duty at 2s. 4dper Spanish quintal (101&apos;8 lb.), amounted to Is. 4o\ per quintal of nitrate f.o.b. in Chile, or  8 Is. 4d. ( 8&apos;07) per long ton of nitrate (95 per cent, purity). The expenses incurred in marketing the product in Europe, including sea freight at 25s. per ton, loss in weight during the voyage, landing charges and port dues, increased the cost to about  10 * 2 per long ton free on shore in England.43. In evidence given before the Committee, it was pointed out that there were considerable variations in the production costs at different nitrate factories, and that the average cost for the whole industry under pre-war conditions, inclusive of all expenses and export duty, might be taken at about 6s. Qd. per quintal f.o.b. in Chile. Upon this basis, the total cost on shore in England would thus have been about  9&apos; 27 per long ton.44. As shown in Table 3, the pre-war selling price of Chile nitrate (95 per cent, purity) in the United Kingdom (average 1911-13) amounted to  10 13s. 9a1. ( 10&apos;69) per long ton, equivalent to&apos; 67&apos; 2 per metric ton of nitrate nitrogen.Pre-War Consumption.45. The following figures have been given for the total consumption of Chile nitrate in different countries during 1911, 1912, and 1913.Table 4.-WpRLD&apos;S PRE-WAR CONSUMPTION OF CHILE NITRATE	Quantities in Metric Tons.

Year V., No. 9, September, 1914.			From 70 to SO per cent, of the total consumption of Chile nitrate was therefore accounted for by the requirements of Germany, the United States, France, and Belgium alone.Uses of Chile Nitrate.46. Although statistics are, not available as to the precise relation between the agricultural and industrial demand for Chile nitrate, there is no doubt that the major portion of the annual consumption was utilised for fertilising purposes. It has been stated that the Chilean Nitrate Committee estimate that two-thirds of the annual consumption are used in agriculture, find that in the opinion of the delegates engaged in nitrate propaganda, the world&apos;s consumption for agriculture amounts to 75 per cent, of the total.47. It will be seen from Table 4 that the bulk of the nitrate was used in Europe and the United States. The consumption in all other countries, including tropical and sub-tropical countries, was small owing to the fact that the conditions of climate and soil in such countries are, broadly speaking, unfavourable to the use of nitrate as a fertiliser. Nitrate is easily washed out of the soil by heavy rainfall, and in swampy soils under anterobic conditions is reduced by soil bacteria to nitrite, which is toxic to plants, and even to gaseous nitrogen.
48, The requirements for industrial purposes were mainly in connection with the mann-facture of nitric acid by the retort process, of sulphuric acid by the chamber process, and of potassium nitrate by the conversion process.Nitric Acid Manufacture.49. The most important industrial use of Chile nitrate was in the manufacture of nitric acid. The pre-war cost of making concentrated (90 per cent.) nitric acid in this country by the retort process, with Chile nitrate at  10&apos;5 per long ton and rectified sulphuric acid at  3 per long ton, including fuel, labour, repairs, general expenses, amortisation and interest on. capital, amounted to  22&apos;7 per long ton of HNO3 (calculated as 100 per cent.) in the form of 90 per cent, nitric acid. This figure is equivalent to  22&apos;3 per metric ton, or  100*5 per metric ton of combined nitrogen in the form of concentrated (90 per cent.) nitric acid (Appendix V., Section I.).50. The average pre-war selling prices of 65 per cent, acid and 94 percent, acid amounted respectively to about  21&apos;5 and  24&apos;5 per long ton of HN()3 (calculated as 100 percent.), equivalent to about  95&apos; 4 and  108&apos; 3 per metric ton of combined nitrogen in the corresponding forms (Appendix V., Section I.).THE BY-PRODUCT AMMONIA INDUSTRY.51. The by-product ammonia industry ranked almost equal in importance with the Chilean nitrate industry. Although the world&apos;s production of ammonia nitrogen just before the war was less than the output of nitrate nitrogen, the rate of growth of the by-product industry was even greater than that of the Chilean industry.52. The by-product industry may be regarded broadly as an outcome of the development of the illuminating gas and coke-oven industries, and its rapid expansion is indicated by the fact that the world&apos;s production of ammonia nitrogen (expressed in terms of ammonium sulphate) increased from about 540,000 tons in 1903 to.about 1,390,000 tons in 1913.Output and Market Prices.53. The scale of the world&apos;s production during the years 1903-1913 and the corresponding average annual market prices in the United Kingdom are set out in the following table, and are also illustrated graphically in an Appendix (Appendix V., Charts C and E). The figures for production represent approximate values only.Table 5.-WOR&apos;LD&apos;S PRE-WAR PRODUCTION OP AMMONIUM SULPHATE.Market Prices in the United Kingdom.

About 70 per cent, of the total output of ammonia nitrogen was therefore produced by Gevmany and the United Kingdom alone.56. The detailed statistics. for the principal producing countries (International Crop Report and Agricultural Statistics, International Institute of Agriculture, Rome, Vol. 7, No. 9, Sept. 1916; also Alkali Inspectors Report for 1913) reveal the interesting fact that the coke-oven industry, in the years 1911 and 1913 respectively, was responsible for no less tlian 84 and 86 per cent, of the total production in Germany, and in 1913 for 78 per cent, of the total production in the United States. In the case of the United Kingdom, the output from the coke-oven industry accounted for 27 and 30 per cent, of the totals in the two years mentioned. It may also be noted that there was an annual production of 12,000 metric tons of ammonium sulphate from sewage in France in the years 1911-1913.Cost of Production.57. The fact that ammonia constitutes a by-product in industries having as their main objective the manufacture of other products such as illuminating gas and metallurgical coke renders it difficult to determine the actual cost of production of by-prqpluct ammonia.58. In the case of the gas industry, the removal of ammonia and other products from illuminating gas is compulsory in this country, and up to the point of running the crude ammonia liquor into wells it may be taken that the only cost incurred is that required to maintain the purity of the gas as demanded by statute, this cost being debited to the gas. Nevertheless, the necessity for removing the ammonia involves a definite capital outlay and definite working expenses, although the latter only represent a small fraction of the total operating charges at a large gasworks. In the case of other industries, such as the coke-oven and producer-gas industries, in which the recovery of ammonia is not compulsory, the capital and operating costs incurred in the installation and use of recovery plant must be debited to the by-product, so that these industries stand on a somewhat different footing as regards the production cost of by-product ammonia.59. It is important to note that the economic positions of the industries mentioned are dependent to a considerable extent upon the revenue obtained from the sale of the by-product, which has tended to assume the position of a principal product. In the event of a heavy fall in the market price of ammonium sulphate there would be little or no stimulus for the use of recovery plant in industries in which the removal of the by-product is not compulsory.60. The pre-war cost in this country of working up crude gas liquor for the manufacture of ammonium sulphate on a substantial scale, at a factory making the necessary sulphuric acid, amounted to about  3 per long ton of sulphate (25 per cent. NH3), or  14&quot;76 per metric ton of combined nitrogen in the form of sulphate. This figure is inclusive of the cost of sulphuric (chamber) acid at, l per long ton, of fuel at 7s. 6d. per ton, of lime at 10s. per cubic yard, of labour, repairs, and general charges, and of interest on capital at the rate of 5 per cent. It is exclusive, however, of the cost of crude gas liquor, the market price of which is itself based upon that of ammonium sulphate, and also of any allowance forJosses of ammonia during the process (Appendix V., Section II).output was actually in the form of ammonia liquor which was used in the manufacture of ammonium salts and for other purposes,55. The following figures have been given for the production of ammonium sulphate in the different countries during 1911, 1912 and 1013 :-
61. In the case of direct recovery as at coke-ovens and gas producers, the manufacturing costs are somewhat lower, the average pre-war cost at a large-scale plant at which ammonia was recovered in the form of weak sulphate liquor amounting to about  2&apos;25 per long ton of sulphate, exclusive of capital charges. The sulphuric acid in this instance was purchased at an average price of about  1 &apos;5 per long ton.62. The market price of ammonium sulphate has hitherto been based upon a quality termed &quot;grey,&quot; containing 24 per cent, of ammonia, but the custom of the trade is to supply a product containing 24&apos; 5 per cent., while a standard of 25 per cent, appears to be coming into vogue. The average (1Q11-13) pre-war selling price in this country amounted to  13 16s. Sd. ( 13&apos;83) per long ton, calculated upon a content of 25 per cent, of ammonia (nominally 24 per cent.), equivalent to  -66&quot; 1 per metric ton of combined nitrogen.63. With regard to the pre-war cost of obtaining a pure concentrated ammonia liquor (20-25 per cent. NH3) from by-product ammonia, the evidence examined by the Committee indicates that the operating costs of a large-scale plant would be of the order of  4 per metric ton of actual NH3 when starting with concentrated gas liquor (14-16 per cent. NH3), and of the order of  7 per metric ton of actual NH3 when starting with crude gas liquor (I&apos; 7 to 2&apos; 1 per cent. NH3). These figures are equivalent to  4 &quot;85 and  8&apos;5 per metric ton of combined nitrogen, and are exclusive of the cost of the impure liquor and of any allowance for losses during the process. The losses may attain serious proportions in the case of plants of small or moderate capacity, but should not exceed 5 per cent, with the best modern plant and efficient management (Appendix V., Section II.).Pre-War Consumption.64. The following figures have been given for the world&apos;s consumption of ammonium sulphate during the two years prior to the war : Table 7.-WORLD&apos;S PRE-WAR CONSUMPTION OF AMMONIUM SULPHATE.

As in the case of Chile nitrate, statistics are not available as to the precise relation between the agricultural and industrial demand for ammonia nitrogen. There is no doubt, however, that the major portion of the output of the by-product ammonia industry was utilised in the form of ammonium sulphate as a fertiliser. Owing to the fact that the sulphate is readily absorbed by jthe soil and is not easily washed out even by tropical rainfall, and also that, unlike Chile nitrate, it does not give rise to toxic products or suffer loss under anaerobic conditions, it is largely used in preference to the latter fertiliser in tropical and sub-tropical countries such as Java and Japan. As is shown in the above table, ammonium sulphate was also extensively used for agriculture in Europe and the United States.66. The requirements for industrial purposes were mainly in connection with ths manufacture of ammonium salts, such as the carbonate and chloride, of cyanides by pro-cesses involving the use of alkali metals or salts, of sodium carbonate by the ammonia-sodaB 2

The commercial manufacture of synthetic nitrogen products from atmospheric nitrogen dates from the beginning of the present century with the establishment of the arc process in No way and afterwards in Austria and Italy. In 1906 the calcium cyanamide process was also successfully established in Italy, and in the subsequent years preceding the war was installed in Germany, Norway, France, Switzerland, America, Austria, Japan, and Sweden The third of the established methods of fixing nitrogen, the Haber process for the synthesis of ammonia, was brought to a successful commercial stage in Germany in 1913. The advances made with nitrogen fixation processes during the 10 years before the war are reviewed below.Pre-War Production of Synthetic Nitrogen Products.68. The statistics relating to the pre-war output of the nitrogen fixation industry are less reliable than those available for the Chile nitrate and by-product ammonia industries, and for two reasons. In the first place, the rapid installation of new factories renders it difficult to determine the extent to which actual production kept pace with the productive capacity of the plants ; in the second place, it is known that a proportion of the output in different countries was consumed locally.: The Norwegian Industry.69. Dealing first with, the Norwegian industry, the following figures have been quoted for the total annual production and home consumption of nitrate of lime in the years 1907 toTable 8.-NORWEGIAN PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION OF NITRATE OF LIME.YjSAR.

Synthetic Ammonia.73. With regard to the Haber or synthetic ammonia process, it is reported that the production of the German factory in 1913 amounted to from 30,000 to 35,000 metric tons of ammonium sulphate. There is no doubt as to the commercial success of the process, for steps were being taken before the war to develop it further on a considerable scale. The Committee has been informed on good authority that contracts were being made with other countries in the early part of 1914 for the forward selling of large quantities of synthetic ammonium sulphate.Pre-War Production Costs and Market Prices.74. The Committee has .devoted considerable attention to the question of the probable order of the costs involved in operating the synthetic processes in the United Kingdom on the basis of pre-war conditions, and the conclusions arrived at are discussed in detail in Section V. of this Report. It may be noted here, however, that the development of nitrogen fixation processes during the pre-war period was mainly confined to countries where cheap water power is available,6619 B 3

The average pre-war market prices of the principal synthetic products in this country during the period 1911-13 were as follows (Appendix II. and Appendix V., Sections III. and V.) :-(a) Nitrate of Lime (13 per cent. N):- 9&apos; 75 per long ton, equivalent to  73&apos; 8 per metric ton of combined nitrogen.(b) Caleium Cyanamide (18 per cent. N):- 10162 per long ton, equivalent to  58&apos; 1 per metric ton of combined nitrogen.Uses of Synthetic Nitrogen Products.76. As in the case of Chile nitrate and ammonium sulphate, the principal synthetic products, calcium nitrate (the so-called &quot; nitrate of lime &quot;) and calcium cyanamide, found their main application in agriculture.Nitrate of Lime.77. The forms of calcium nitrate originally manufactured were hygroscopic, and therefore less convenient to handle and put on the land than Chile nitrate. Apart from this drawback, which had been almost entirely overcome prior to the war, the material is an excellent fertiliser, its lime content being a valuable asset in soils deficient in this constituent. Moreover, it * appears to be free from the disadvantage which Chile nitrate possesses of causing the denocculation of clay and thereby rendering heavy soils sticky.Calcium Cyanamide.78. The dusty character of calcium cyanamide as first introduced constituted a drawback to its use, but this objection appears to have been overcome by recent improvements in the after-treatment of the raw manufactured product. A new objection was thereby introduced, however, in that a certain amount of dicyandiamide was formed which is toxic to plants. The decomposition of calcium cyanamide in the soil results in the formation of ammonia, so that the fertiliser can be substituted for, and employed like ammonium sulphate under conditions that are unfavourable to the use of nitrate. The free and combined lime in calcium cyanamide is also an asset of some value in certain soils, such as those deficient in lime. In addition to its utility in agriculture, calcium cyanamide constitutes a raw material for the manufacture of ammonia and crude cyanides, and also of valuable organic compounds such as dicyandiamide, guanidine, and urea and its derivatives.Sodium Nitrite and Ammonium Nitrate.79. Of the remaining synthetic nitrogen products previously referred to, sodium nitrite was employed in the manufacture of artificial dyes, and ammonium nitrate for the production of safety explosives, of laughing gas for anaesthetic purposes, and probably, to a limited extent, as a fertiliser. The high nitrogen content (35 per cent.) of ammonium nitrate, and the consequent economy in packages and freight, render the employment of the product as a fertiliser an attractive proposition, but the deliquescent character of the material as at first prepared militated against its general adoption. This drawback had not been overcome prior to the war, but further reference is made to the question in the section of the Report dealing with the post-war aspects of the nitrogen problem (see page 85).RELATIVE POSITIONS OF THE NITROGEN INDUSTRIES.80. The following tables indicate the relative positions of the Chile nitrate, by-product ammonia and nitrogen fixation industries as regards the scale of production and consumption during the three years 1910 to 1912 : -Table 12.-WORLD&apos;S PRE-WAR PRODUCTION OF NITROGENOUS FERTILISERS.
As far as actual tonnage is concerned, the synthetic industries only accDunted for about 1*5 per cent., 27 per cent., and 4&apos;1 per cent, respectively of the worhfs production of artificial nitrogenous fertilisers during the years 1910-12.Table 13.-WORLD&apos;S PRE-WAR CONSUMPTION OF NITROGENOUS FERTILISERS.PilODUCT.

Upon the basis of actual tonnage, the synthetic industries only accounted for about I per cent., 2 per cent., and 4 per cent, respectively, of the world&apos;s consumption of artificial nitrogenous fertilisers during the three years in question.COMPARATIVE VALUES OF NITROGENOUS FERTILISERS.81. The question of the comparative values of the nitrogenous fertilisers is one of considerable importance as a factor in the competition between synthetic and non-synthetic products and in determining their relative prices per unit of nitrogen.82. Unfortunately, the question can only be answered with accuracy in specific cases, owing to the varying effect of the same fertiliser upon different crops and to the further variations caused by differences in the nature of soils and climate. Moreover, the synthetic fertilisers have not been used so long nor to anything like the same extent as Chile nitrate and ammonium sulphate, and in consequence their secondary effects upon the soil are not so well established. In these circumstances it is not surprising that the comparative values determined in different countries and in different parts of the same country exhibit . considerable divergence. The Committee desires to emphasise, the fact that the various statements given below must be regarded as indicative ordy, and that even the most recent data upon the question cannot be considered as final.Values under German and Austrian Conditions.83. The following table, which is based upon the results of a number of independent investigations carried out in Germany and Austria prior to and during 1914, gives a general indication of the comparative values of the principal nitrogenous fertilisers under the conditions prevailing in those countries.Table 14.

84. A further indication of the views held in Germany upon the comparative values of different forms of combined nitrogen for fertilising purposes is afforded by the proposed &quot; monopoly &quot; law of 1915, which, however, was rejected. According to this law the following prices for nitrogenous products were to have been fixed in Germany for a period of five years after the war.Table 15.-COMPARATIVE VALUES OF NITROGENOUS FERTILISERS UNDER GERMANCONDITIONS,Form op Combined Nitrogen.

A large number of trials with the different nitrogenous fertilisers have been carried out at agricultural colleges and experimental stations in the United Kingdom, and summaries of the results obtained have been published (See Journal of the Society of . Chemical Industry, Vol. 36, No. 5, 1917, p. 258.; and Vol. 37, No. 8, 1918, p. 146). It is difficult in most cases to express the results in the form of a comparative table of the kind given above owing to the number of different factors involved. The following table, however, which is based upon the results obtained at Rothamsted Experimental Station during the period 1909-1914, gives an indication of the relative values of the nitrogenous fertilisers under the particular conditions prevailing at that station.Table 16.-COMPARATIVE YIELDS WITH NITROGENOUS FERTILISERS AT ROTHAMSTED1909-1914.Chile Nitrate ss 100.Chop.

It has been said on good authority that for the conditions prevailing in the United Kingdom, the all-round fertilising value of ammonium sulphate may bo placed at from 90 to 95 as compared with a value of 100 in the case of Chile nitrate.87. With regard to the all-round fertilising value of calcium cyanamide under British conditions, the Committee has been supplied with a summary of experimental results Table 17) based upon the use of equal amounts of nitrogen in the form of cyanamide and ammonium sulphate.88. It will be seen that in. some cases calcium cyanamide has proved relatively ineffective while in others its comparative value has been very high. These divergent results are probably due in part to the method of use, to the character of the soil aiid season, and possibly to the presence in the cyanamide of undetected impurities which may occur to a varying extent. In the light of the experience hitherto gained with cyanamide under British conditions, the general average of the figures in Table 17, namely, about 94, as compared with a value of 100 for ammonia nitrogen, is perhaps as near an all-round value as can. be given.89. Taking the all-round fertilising value of Chile nitrate at 100 and that of ammonium sulphate at from 90 to 95, the value of calcium cyanamide may therefore be placed, tentatively, at from 84 to 89. In view of previous comments, however, the Committee again desires to draw attention to the fact that the comparative values realised in different parts of the country and under, different conditions may show marked divergences from these figures.

The information, and statistics given above in connection with the pre-war position of the nitrogen industries reveal a number of striking features, and. the salient ones are summarised below (a) The world&apos;s demand for combined nitrogen in 1913 was practically doable the demand in 1903, about 4,000,000 metric tons of artificial nitrogenous fertilisers being consumed in 1913.(b) Practically the whole of the world&apos;s demand was met by the Chile nitrate and by-product ammonia industries, the output of the synthetic industry being relatively insignificant in spite of its notable development during the years 1903 to 1913.(c) The relation between the output of ammonia nitrogen and of nitrate nitrogen was undergoing modification on account of the rapid growth of the by-product industry, which expanded by more than 150 per cent, during the period 1903-1913 as compared with an expansion of over 70 per cent, in the case of the Chile nitrate industry.(d) The Chile nitrate industry provided about two-thirds of the world&apos;s supplies of combined nitrogen in 1903, and about three-fifths in 1913, the market price of the nitrate governing that of combined nitrogen.(e) The market price of combined nitrogen during the years 1903-1913, although showing considerable fluctuations, was characterised by a general upward- tendency.(/) The synthetic industry, although in its infancy, was in a position to place nitrogenous fertilisers upon the market at a price comparing not unfavourably with the .  current market prices of nitrate and ammonia nitrogen.III.-THE PRE-WAR POSITION OP THE UNITED KINGDOM.91. The whole of the combined nitrogen produced from native resources in the United Kingdom in the pre-war period consisted of the ammoniacal and other nitrogenous compounds obtained in the by-product ammonia industry. For many years the United Kingdom was the wqrld&apos;s largest producer of by-product ammonia, but in 1910-11 the lead was taken by Germany as the result of the extensive development of the recovery coke-oven industry in that country.92. The home consumption of ammonia nitrogen was relatively small, and the largest part of the output was exported in the form of ammonium sulphate, so that the-United Kingdom occupied a strong position in the fertiliser markets abroad.Table 17.-COMPARATIVE VALUE OF CALCIUM CTANAM1DE UNDER BRITISHCONDITIONS.

93. With regard to other forms of combined nitrogen consumed in the country, the principal demand was for nitrate nitrogen for use in agriculture and in such essential industries as the manufacture of nitric acid, sulphuric acid, and explosives. For all these requirements, the United Kingdom was entirely dependent upon imported nitrates.THE BY-PRODUCT AMMONIA INDUSTRY.94. The growth of the by-product ammonia industry in the United Kingdom during the years 1903 to 1913, the extent to which the output of the industry was exported, and the estimated home consumption of ammonia nitrogen for all purposes including manure manu-facture, are shown in Table 18 which is based upon the statistics given in the Annual Reports of the Chief Inspector of Alkali Works. The home production is also illustrated graphically in an Appendix (Appendix V., Chart D). It should be noted that the figures are inclusive of all forms of ammoniacal compounds, such as ammonia liquor and ammonium salts, expressed in terms of ammonium sulphate.95. The table opposite reveals a number of striking facts which may be summarised as follows :  (a) The total British production of ammonia nitrogen in 1913 was practically double the production in 1903.(6) Of the producing industries, the recovery coke-oven industry showed a remarkable expansion, the output of b,y-product ammonia from this source in 1913 being nearly eight times the output in 1903, and amounting to over 30 per cent, of the total production.(c) The gasworks industry, which occupied an outstanding position in 1903* and accounted for nearly 65 per cent, of the total output of ammonia nitrogen in that year, exhibited a steady expansion with an increased output of 20 per cent, in 1913. In consequence of the development of the other by-product industries, this output represented about 40 per cent, of the total in 1913.(d) In the case of the smaller by-product industries, the output from producer-gas and carbonising works had trebled by 1913, while that from shale works had nearly doubled. The output from ironworks during the period 1903-1913 remained stationary.(e) The British exports of ammonium sulphate in 1913 were double those in 1903, accounting for over 75 per cent, of the total production as compared with nearly 70 per cent, in 1903.(/) The estimated home consumption for all purposes, although showing a steady expansion, was only 35 per cent, greater in 1913 than in 1903,representing about 22 per cent, of the total production in 1913.IMPORTS OF CHILE NITRATE.   -96. Although appreciable quantities of potassium nitrate and Peruvian guano were utilised in the United Kingdom, the most essential of all the imported nitrogenous products was Chile nitrate. The table given below for the annual importation of Chile nitrate durinp; the years 1903 to 1913 has been compiled from the statistics given in the Board of Trade Returns.   The figures are also illustrated graphically in an Appendix (Appendix V., Chart D.).Table 19. BRITISH PRE-WAR IMPORTATION OF CHILE NITRATE.Year,	Chile Nitrate. Long Tons.

The imports of Chile nitrate showed considerable fluctuations during the period 1903-1913, but there was a general increase in the importation during the latter four years. The amount of combined nitrogen imported in the form of Chile nitrate in 1903 was approxi-mately 40 per cent, of the home production of ammonia nitrogen, and in 1913 about 25 per cent, of the home production.NITROGEN BALANCE SHEET FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM.97. Although the statistics set out above, afford a broad idea of the pre-war position in the United Kingdom, the Committee considered it essential to investigate the position in much greater detail. In order to obtain representative figures, a period of three years, namely, 1911-1913, was selected for examination. With the assistance afforded by other Government Departments and by importers, producers, and users of nitrogen products, the Committee has been able to prepare an average annual balance sheet of the nitrogen industry of the United Kingdom.98. The complete statistics upon which the balance sheet is based are set out in an Appendix, together with detailed notes indicating their sources [Appendix II.). The balance sheet itself is given below (Table 20), and indicates the average annual production, importa-tion, consumption, and exportation of combined nitrogen for the period 1911-1913. The average yearly amounts of combined nitrogen of all forms, exclusive of that contained in guano, farmyard manure, shoddy, bones, sewage, and the like, produced in or imported into this country, and the manner in which it was disposed of, are indicated in Table 21, which summarises the detailed figures given in the balance sheet. It is believed to be the first time that statements of this character have been prepared.Table 20.-NTTROGEN BALANCE SHEET.Annual Average for Pre-War Period 1911-13.	Quantities in.

The average annual output of ammonia nitrogen for the period 1911-13 amounted to 82,404 metric tons, equivalent to 393,927 long tons of ammonium sulphate (25 per cent. NH3), and it has been found possible to account for the ultimate disposal of practically the whole of this. The quantity unaccounted for amounts to 1,303 metric tons of ammonia nitrogen equivalent to 6,189 long tons of ammonium sulphate (25 per cent. NH3), or only 1&apos;6 per cent, of the total. With regard to this quantity, it is to be observed that ammonia is used in chemical industries for which no statistics have been available, and that the unavoidable loss by volatilisation during the transport of ammonia liquors must be considerable.100. The most interesting fact revealed by the statistics is that prior to the war the United Kingdom, after all home demands for ammonia nitrogen had been met, exported 67,664 metric tons of nitrogen per annum (average 1911-13) in the form of ammonia, ammonium salts or products made therefrom. This was equivalent to 323,473 long tons of ammonium sulphate (25 per cent. NH3), or over 82 per cent, of the total home production of ammonia nitrogen.101. This amount was far in excess of what would have been required to provide by oxidation all the nitrate and nitric nitrogen used in the country for agricultural, industrial, and military purposes before the outbreak of war. In other words, the ammonia produced in the country was sufficient not only to meet the home demand for ammonia nitrogen, but also to have supplied in an emergency, had the means of conversion been available, the nitrate and nitric nitrogen required for all purposes, and still to have left a large margin of ammonium sulphate for exportation. But, as a matter of fact, we neither possessed the plant nor the experience necessary for the conversion of ammonia into nitric nitrogen, and the country was absolutely dependent upon imported nitrates not only for one of its most valuable fertilisers, but also for the means of manufacturing nitric acid, sulphuric acid, explosives and numerous other products involving the employment of nitrate and nitric nitrogen. The combined nitrogen consumed in these manufacturing operations only amounted to about 8,200 metric tons, as compared with 11,926 metric tons of nitrate nitrogen (as Chile nitrate) used in agri-culture, but it was of vital importance to the country since, unlike the nitrates employed in agriculture, it could not be replaced by any other form of fixed nitrogen.Importation of Combined Nitrogen.102. The average annual importation of combined nitrogen in the period 1911-1913 amounted to 23,979 metric tons, of which 20,829 metric tons, or 86&apos;8 per cent., were in the form of Chile nitrate, representing 130,997 long tons of Chile nitrate (95 per cent, purity). The other principal imports were potassium, calcium, and ammonium nitrate and calcium cyanamide, and accounted respectively for 1,592, 475, 381, and 570 metric tons of combined nitrogen. It has been found possible to account for the disposal of the whole of the Chile nitrate with the exception of about 1&apos; 9 per cent103. In addition to the imports of potassium nitrate, a quantity (4,819 long tons), equivalent to 678 metric tons of combined nitrogen, was ascertained to have been prepared in this country from Chile nitrate and potassium chloride by the conversion process. A balance of 2,474 long tons of potassium nitrate or 350 metric tons of combined nitrogen remains unaccounted for, but it is known that considerable quantities, for which no statistics were obtainable, were employed in the meat-curing and glass-making industries, and in the manufacture of exported rockets and flares.Table 21.-SUMMARY OF NITROGEN BALANCE SHEET.
Combined Nitrogen used in Sulphuric and Nitric Acid Industries.104. The numerous industrial purposes for which combined nitrogen was employed and the corresponding average annual consumption are indicated in fairly comprehensive detail in an Appendix (Appendix II.), but special reference must be made to the sulphuric acid and nitric acid industries.&quot; The sulphuric acid industry has long been the &quot; key &quot; industry of the chemical trade in the United Kingdom, and the average annual consumption of nitrate nitrogen in the period 1911-1913 for providing the oxides of nitrogen needed in the leaden chamber process of making sulphuric acid amounted to 2,885 metric tons, equivalent to 18,144 long tons of Chile nitrate. With regard to the nitric acid industry and the manufacture of explosives and munitions, the average annual consumption of nitric nitrogen&apos;amounted, as far as can be ascertained, to 3,196 metric tons, equivalent to about 14,150 long tons HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.).Nitrogen Products Consumed in Agriculture.105. The average annual consumption of nitrogen products in agriculture amounted to 25,015 metric tons of combined nitrogen, and of this quantity ammonium sulphate accounted for 12,044 metric tons and Chile nitrate for 11,920 metric tons, the remaining 1,045 metric tons being in the form of calcium cyanamide and calcium nitrate. The actual average consumption of ammonium sulphate (25 per cent. NH3) was 57,600 long tons and of Chile nitrate 75,000 tons.106. It should be noted that other nitrogenous fertilisers, such as farmyard manure, guano, shoddy and sewage, were also utilised in the United Kingdom. It is estimated that the annual production of farmyard manure amounts to approximately 37 million tons with a nitrogen content of some 0&apos;6 per cent., thus representing about 220,000 tons of combined nitrogen. Although considerable losses of nitrogen undoubtedly occur in consequence of defective methods of heaping and storage, it is apparent that farmyard manure constitutes by far the most important source of combined nitrogen for agriculture in the United Kingdom. It is also estimated that products such as guano, fish and meat meal, bones, wool and other wastes used in agriculture represented the equivalent of a further 3,000 or 4,000 tons of combined nitrogen.MARKET PRICES.107. The average pre-war market prices of the principal nitrogen products in this country during the period 1911-13 are summarised below.

IV.-POWER PRODUCTION FOR NITROGEN FIXATION.108. Of the three well-established methods of fixing atmospheric nitrogen, two, the direct arc process and the indirect cyanamide process, involve the use of power on a large scale. In view of the importance of the cost of power as a factor in the general economy of some of the fixation processes, it is necessary at this stage to anticipate the conclusions set out in detail in later sections of this Report and to summarise the figures for the power requirements of the established processes and the more important of the partly-developed processes in order to provide a basis for an examination of the power problem. The figures are set out in the following table: Table 23.-POWER REQUIREMENTS OP NITROGEN FIXATION PROCESSES.Fixation Processes.	Per Kg. of Nitrogen Fixed. Kw.-b.ours.

I When using stationary explosion bombs with mechanically-operated valve gear.   Allowance has been made for thesteam-raiding value of the exhaust gases from the bombs.The above figures make clear the reason why the developments of the arc and calciu mcyanamide processes have hitherto been confined to countries where cheap water power is available.109. In order to enable a comparison to be made of the relative merits of the principal fixation processes from the standpoint of British conditions and of foreign competition, the first question to be determined is : What is the most economical method of generating electrical energy on a large scale in this country and the probable minimum cost?POWER FROM COAL: GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.110. At the present time, the water power developed in the United Kingdom is an insig-significant fraction of the power obtained by the use of coal, and it has usually been assumed that electrical energy generated from coal is altogether too costly to permit of the economical operation of nitrogen fixation processes. This view, however, must be modified to some extent on account of the improvements and developments that have been made during the past few years in large steam turbo-electric generator units. The experience gained both in this country and abroad has definitely established the reliability of units of 10,&apos;)00 to 20,000 kw. capacity and more, and has provided adequate data concerning the substantial economies effected in the consumption of steam (and hence of coal), in the costs of labour and repairs, and in the capital, outlay, consequent upon the employment of such units. It cannot be too strongly emphasised that the only possible chance of obtaining electrical energy from coal at a cost comparable with that of water power is by operating upon a very large scale.Coal Consumption.111. The outstanding item in the cost of generation is the cost of coal, and the effect of the employment of large steam turbo-electric units upon the coal consumption per kw.-year is shown in Table 24. The figures given in the second column repiesent the overall thermal requirements of the power station per kw.-hour available at the switchboard for external use.Table 24.-COAL CONSUMPTION OF STEAM TURBO-ELECTRIC POWER PLANT,Sizes of Steam Turbo-Electric Units.

Even the figure of 20,000 B.Th.U. per unit output is held by some authorities to be too high, and the Committee has been reliably informed that there are power plants in this country operating at the present time at 18,000 to 19,000 B.TI1.U. per unit output, Similar figures have been published recently in regard to the power station at Connors Creek in the United States.Load Factor.112. In the case of an electric power station of sufficient size to ensure the optimum economy in working, the important consideration in determining the cost per kw.-year is the load factor at which the station operates. Although more coal is consumed as the load factor is increased, it is more effectively used owing to the diminution in stand-by losses; moreover, the fixed charges are distributed over a larger output, so that the cost per unit generated decreases. This is clearly indicated in the detailed estimate of the cost of generation at a large-scale station given on page 28. A high annual load factor of, say, 90 per cent, or more is, in fact, essential for the mo&amp;t economical generation of power from coal, and in ihis connection it is important to note that the two established nitrogen fixation processes involving the largest power requirements, namely, the direct arc process, and the indirect cyanamide process, must also be operated at a high annual load factor to ensure the maximum economy.Summary of Fundamental Factors.113. In the production of power for nitrogen fixation processes it is therefore fundamentally necessary that (a) large units of power plant should be employed so as to minimise the capital cost per kw. installed, the coal consumption and the running costs of the power station; (6) ,the power plant should be operated at a high annual load factor still further to diminish the running costs per unit output; and (e) the design of the units of power plant should be such that the utmost reliability of supply is ensured.Premisses of the Problem.114. From the power point of view, the Committee has been faced with the problem of the possibility of providing power stations for nitrogen fixation wdiich will not only operate economically for military requirements, but which will be able to operate with commercial success after the war.  The Committee has had to bear in mind the following premisses: (a) That water power is available in Norway at costs ranging from  1&quot;2 per kw.-year at exceptionally favourable sites to  2 per kw.-year at &quot; average &quot; sites, the latter figure being the more probable price which will have to be paid in the case of future developments of water power in that country.(6) That special power stations erected in this country for nitrogen fixation may very well form nuclei for future larger stations for general industrial supply purposes.(c) That an abundant natural supply of condensing water is an essential for the economical operation of large steam-driven power stations.(d) That, with the primary object of obtaining fixed nitrogen, the generation of power from coal by methods involving the total loss of the combined nitrogen in the coal itself is irrational.(e) That with a view to utilising the national resources in fuel to the maximum advantage, the generation of power from coal should be effected by methods, if com-mercially feasible, whereby the nitrogenous and other by-products are recovered, and noi wasted, as hitherto, in the process of combustion.Condensing Water in relation to Site of Power Station.115. It has often been advocated that large power stations should be situated at the collieries or even at the pit&apos;s mouth in order that the cost of coal delivered into the bunkers may be reduced to the lowest possible point. This course would be perfectly sound provided the other principal requirement of a cheaply operated power station could be obtained at the same site, namely, an abundant natural supply of circulating water for condensing purposes, capable of being utilised without undue cost for pumping.116. Modern steam turbines are the most economical users of steam in existence when worked at a high vacuum, and a high vacuum can only be obtained with a very large supply of cold water, amounting to as much as 70 times the weight of steam condensed. In the case, for example, of a station loaded to 100,000 kw., at least 6,000,000 gallons of condensing water would be required per hour, or at a load factor, of 95*per cent., some 136,000,000 gallons per day. The only alternative to_a large_ natural supply of circulating water is to use cooling towers, with a consequent large permanent loss of wafer by evaporation, and a considerable increase in the temperature of the condensing water, leading to a serious addition to the coal consumption of the power station. The constant loss by evaporation into the atmosphere amounts in practice to about 2 per cent, of the total, and as this is irrecoverable it has to be constantly made up from an outside source.   In the case cited above of a 100,000 kw. station
operating at a load factor of 95 per cent., the employment of cooling towers would necessitate a daily supply of 2,720,000 gallons of make-up water to replace losses. With a gooil modern condenser, a vacuum of 29 inches (with the barometer at 30 inches) can be obtained by using condensing water equivalent to 70 times the weight of steam condensed, and at a temperature of 550 f., which may be taken as the average temperature of any large river or arm of the sea. If cooling towers were used, the average temperature of the condensing water with the very high load factor of the power station would be not less than 750 f. At this temperature and using the same quantity of water, the vacuum would only be 28&apos; 2 inches, a diminution of 0&apos;8 inch, representing an increase of about 6 per cent, in the consumption of steam and of coal. This would mean an additional 35,600 tons of coal per annum for a power station of 100,000 kw. capacity operating at a load factor of 95 per cent., while the cost of the cooling towers themselves with accessories would amount to about  100,000.117. To sum up, a large power station at a colliery site having to rely upon cooling towers for condensing purposes involves an increased capital expenditure, an increased consumption of coal, a large initial supply of water for the towers and a large- daily supply for make-up purposes. As an off-set against these factors must be put the extra cost of delivering the coal to a waterside station where an abundant natural supply of condensing water could be obtained at a low cost for pumping.118. The Committee is not aware of any localities in Great Britain where natural supplies of condensing water of the magnitude &quot;indicated above can be obtained at the pit&apos;s mouth, or in. proximity to collieries, and it is impracticable to transmit so large an amount of water over any considerable length of pipe or culvert. There are, however, several districts where a waterside station could be built at no great distance from a coalfield, and the only practical compromise is to locate the power station by the waterside and to carry the coal from the pit to the station. Such sites would afford facilities for the delivery of coal and for the transport of raw and finished materials both by rail and by water.DIRECT COAL-FIRED STATIONS.119. Before considering the economies that might be effected by the use cf by-product recovery schemes for power production, it is essential in the first place to examine the possibilities of direct coal-firing in the light of modern practice with large units of steam turbo-electric power plant. A detailed estimate, based upon the latest pre-war figures, has therefore been carefully prepared by the Committee, setting out the capital and operating costs of a coal-fired steam turbo-electric power station having an installed capacity of 125,000 kw. and a maximum load of 100,000 kw. This capacity has been chosen as repre-senting a reasonable size of station for the production of power at the least possible cost for nitrogen fixation or other purposes.Capital Cost.120.

The costs per kw.-year, with coal at 5s., 7s. 6d., and 10s. per ton, and at load factors of 95 per cerit., 97&apos; 5 per cent., and 100 per cent, would then be,as follows : 121. It is interesting to contrast the above figure with the capital costs involved in the development of water powers&apos;in different countries, although it must be noted that the latter are governed by topographical features and vary within wide limits. Owing to the great height of the falls in Norway, often, accompanied by easy storage, the cost of development at most favourable sites in that country has run as low as  0 to  7 per-kw. developed, but. a moderate cost would be from  14 to  15 per kw. A standard cost in the United States would be about  26 per kw., the cost at Niagara having varied from  23 to  30 per kw. The Kinlochleven scheme in Scotland cost about  31 per kw. developed, and there are many places in the British Empire where water power can be developed for  10 to  15 per kilowatt.122. It will be seen that the capital cost of modern large-scale steam turbo-electric power plant is as low as, or lower than, the cost of development of hydro-electric installations except at the most favourable water-power sites. Moreover, while improvements in design and construction may be expected to diminish the capital cost of steam power plant, the cost of harnessing water powers may be expected to increase as the most favourable sites become developed. ,Cost of Generation.123. Having regard to the economical use of steam by modern steam turbines, an important factor in determining the Coal consumption and hence the working costs of a large station is the thermal efficiency of the boilers. Notwithstanding the claims that have been made for thermal efficiences as high as 85 per cent, for coal-fired water-tube boilers with superheaters and economisers, the Committee, in the light of the wide experience of some of its members, is of the opinion that the best average working efficiency of such a combination will not exceed 80 per cent., and this figure has been adopted.124. The annual working expenses, under pre-war conditions, of a coal-fired power station of 100,000 kw. maximum demand operating at load factors of 95, 97*5 and 100 per cent, respectively, are estimated from known facts on the bases of: Maximum load     ----- 100,000 kw.Calorific value of coal as fired      -.       -        - 12,500 B.Th.U. per lb.

It lias been emphasised that it is only possible to obtain electrical energy from coal at a cost comparable with that of water power by resorting to steam-power plant of large size. The smaller the size of the power station and of the steam turbo-electric units, the greater is the cost of generation, principally on account of the higher coal consumption and the higher wages per unit output. The question as to the minimum scale upon which it would be economical to generate power for nitrogen fixation in the United Kingdom is therefore one of considerable importance.127. In the case of the arc process, the cost of electrical energy is the vital factor owing to the large consumption per unit of nitrogen fixed, and every additional  1 per kw.-year in the cost represents an increase in the manufacturing expenses of about  8&apos;-4 per metric ton of fixed nitrogen. From the point of view of foreign competition, an arc process installation even at a steam-power station of 100,000 kw. capacity is handicapped as compared with an installation utilising &quot; cheap &quot; or &quot; average &quot; water power. The minimum scale of steam-power station for operating the arc process to the best advantage under British conditions is thus determined by the minimum cost of generating electrical energy from coal. From the point of view of the home nitric acid industry, however, it&apos; is worthy of note that the arc process, if operated on a scale of from 15,000 to 20,000 kw. could produce concentrated (93 to 96 per cent.) nitric acid at a lower cost than the standard retort process using Chile nitrate as long as the cost of electrical energy did not exceed  9 per kw.-year.128. In the case of the cyanamide process, there are two factors to be considered : the cost of electrical energy, and the comparative positions of the United Kingdom and other countries in respect of the availability and &quot;cost of the necessary raw materials, high grade anthracite and limestone. With regard to the first, every additional  1 per kw.-year in the cost of energy represents an increase in the manufacturing expenses of the order of  2 per metric ton of fixed nitrogen or about 8s. per metric ton of raw cyanamide. The most economical steam turbo-electric practice would thus be handicapped to the extent of about  3&apos; 5 per ton of nitrogen fixed as compared with the case of &quot; average &quot; Norwegian water power. This disadvantage of about 14s. per ton of cyanamide would, however, be offset to some extent by the second factor mentioned above and by the sea freight involved in marketing the foreign product in this country. The Committee has come to the conclusion that an ad Hoc steam power station of at least 30,000 kw. capacity is the minimum size that could be recommended for the manufacture of calcium cyanamide in the United Kingdom. Such a station would ensure a reasonable economy in the cost of generation, and further economies would be effected if the station were designed as the nucleus of a large station for general power supply because steam turbo-electric units of a size larger than would ordinarily be used in. a station of 30,000 kw. capacity could then be installed. A development of this character would be advantageous not only to the nitrogen factory but also to the power station which would be ensured of a large constant load at a high annual load factor.Losses of By-product Nitrogen in Direct Coal-firing.129. Although the percentage of nitrogen contained in coal is small, the annual loss in the operation of a direct coal-fired power station of 100,000 kw. capacity is very considerable, and an indication will now be given of the quantity that might be recovered as ammonia or ammonium sulphate if the coal were utilised in other ways. ^130. It is well established that by completely gasifying coal in recovery producers, at least 70 per cent, of its nitrogen content can be recovered in the form of ammonium sulphate. Upon the basis of this figure and assuming that the coal used for direct firing contained an average of 1&apos; 2 per cent, of nitrogen, each ton (1,016 kg.) consumed represents the loss or possible recovery of 8 &quot;53 kg. of by-product nitrogen or approximately 41&apos;5 kg. of ammonium sulphate (25 per cent. NH3).c 2

It is important at this stage to note that other valuable by-products obtainable from coal in addition to nitrogen are also lost in the process of combustion.Productive Capacity of Power Station.132. The amount of atmospheric nitrogen capable of being fixed per annum by a continuous power supply of 100,000 kw. is as follows: By the-(a) Arc process: 11,890 metric tons, in the form of 53,500 metric tons of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.);(b) Cyanamide process : 50,760 metric tons, in the form of over 260,000 tons of raw cyanamide (19&apos; 5 per cent. N).The by-product nitrogen lost by the combustion of the coal is therefore equivalent to from 10 to 40 per cent, of the capacity of the power plant for fixing atmospheric nitrogen.Observation.133. There is no question that the direct use of coal under boilers in conjunction with steam turbo-electric units of large size necessitates the smallest capital outlay and the smallest consumption of coal for a given output of power in kw.-years. With such a plant, however, nitrogenous and other by-products from the coal are entirely lost, and when the potential value of these by-products is taken into account, it does not necessarily follow that direct coal-firing is the cheapest method of obtaining power from coal.POWER PRODUCTION WITH BY-PRODUCT RECOVERY.134. It has often been claimed that substantial economies can be effected in the cost of generating power from coal by submitting the fuel to a preliminary treatment in order to recover by-products, the revenue from the sale of the latter being credited to the working costs of the complete power installation. In view of the vital importance of cheap electrical power not merely for nitrogen fixation but also for the whole industrial future of this country, and of the necessity for utilising the national fuel resources to the utmost advantage, the Committee has devoted very considerable time to the examination of the problem of power production with by-product recovery.135. The question at issue is a complex one owing to the number of possible methods of treating fuel as a preliminary to power production, such as by carbonisation at a high or a low temperature, by complete gasification in recovery producers, or by combination schemes involving carbonisation followed by the gasification of the resulting coke. In considering such methods from the standpoint of power, account has to be taken of numerous factors of which the following may be specially mentioned : (a) The effect upon the fuel consumption at the power station of using boilers fired with coke or gas in place of coal.(6) The comparative advantages and disadvantages attaching to the various methods of treating fuel, particularly as regards capital and operating costs, thermal efficiency and the yield and value of the by-products.(c) The financial results that might be expected in applying by-product schemes &apos; - -&apos; to the large-scale production of power, with particular reference to tire effect of variations131. The magnitude of the annual loss of ammonia nitrogen at a large power station is shown in the following table: .
in tike price of coal, in the market price of the by-products, in the nitrogen content of the coal, and so on.(d) The availablity of coal that might be suitable for carbonisation or gasification although unsuitable for direct use under boilers.136. The Committee has received much valuable evidence concerning the various aspects of the problem from experts of recognised authority, and the information relating to high temperature carbonisation, to the gasification of coal and coke in recovery producers, and to the firing of boilers with gas or coke is based upon first-hand practical experience. With the object of obtaining similar information upon low temperature carbonisation, tests were carried out by the Munitions Inventions Department under the direction of the Committee at an experimental plant of moderate scale in London. These tests, however, were not as satisfactory as had been anticipated, and cannot be said to have added to the information already at the disposal of the Committee. Arrangements have also been in progress for some time past for carrying out, under the direction of the Committee, an organised trial under commercial con-ditions of an installation now in partial operation in Yorkshire. It was hoped that the practical data furnished, by such a trial would have enabled conclusions to be formed as to the possibilities of that particular low temperature process. Under the present difficult conditions, however, it has not hitherto been possible to bring the plant into full-scale commercial operation and the trial still remains to be carried out.137. Low temperature carbonisation has been the subject of much experimental work, some on a large scale, and the result of this work has been to indicate, within limits, the order of the yield of by-products and their general character. It must be noted, however, that there is no established commercial practice in this country extending over an adequate period, as in the case of the metallurgical coke and illuminating gas industries, upon which definite and reliable data as to costs and average yields can be based. Having regard to the different conditions under which the process can be carried out and to the influence of the carbonising temperature, the duration of the operation, and the character of the coal upon the. yield and quality of the resulting by-products, gas, and coke, it is clear that considerable caution is necessary in attempting to draw definite conclusions pending the substantiation of existing data by commercial operations. In view, however, of the claims that have been made on behalf of low temperature carbonisation, its possibilities have been examined in detail in the light of the data furnished to the Committee for the processes operated at the two plants referred to above (hereafter termed System A and System B in Tables 29-34, and in Appendix IV.).138. The information collated by the Committee upon the subject of power production with by-product recovery is given in some detail in an Appendix (Appendix IV.) together with a set of thermal and financial balance sheets, the latter being in the form of graphs. It is believed that the summary there presented is more comprehensive in character than any single statement hitherto published. The basic data adopted in comparing the different schemes, the general trend of the evidence, and the conclusions of the Committee are dealt with below.Thermal Efficiency of Boilers.139. The application of by-product recovery schemes to power production on a large scale involves the utilisation of gas and coke for steam-raising purposes instead of coal. The general economy of such schemes is thus affected by the comparative thermal efficiencies of boilers fired with the fuels in question and working under average conditions in a station operating at a high-load factor.] 40. In the case of direct coal-firing, a thermal efficiency of 80 per cent, for a boiler with superheater and economiser has been adopted, as previously mentioned, and the conclusions of the Committee as regards boilers fired with coke and gas are indicated below....  -.       -   (Coke-fired Boilers.141. Boilers fired with broken gas-coke and coke breeze are now becoming more numerous, and with properly arranged furnaces and forced draught are giving good results. From data supplied by users and by boiler-makers it appears that thermal efficiencies of about 70 per cent, for a boiler alone can be obtained, and the Committee is of the opinion that with the addition of superheaters and economisers the average working efficiency should rise to about 75 per cent. The results, however, will be largely dependent upon the amount of moisture in the coke, and upon the draught available. Test figures as high as 85 per cent, have been put forward, but the Committee does not consider that such a high efficiency could be maintained in ordinary everyday practice. v142. The Committee has not been able to obtain from actual users any reliable figures for the thermal efficiency of boilers when fired with coke obtained by low temperature carbonisation -tion. In this case the amount of volatile matter left in the coke, its moisture content, and the draught available will each have an important bearing upon the results obtainable. From the information at its disposal, the Committee considers that the thermal efficiency under good working conditions would probably be between 70 and 75 per cent, for a boiler alone without economisers and superheaters, and between 75 and 80 per cent, with them.   It has been6619 OS
assumed for the purposes of the comparative figures given later, that a boiler fired with low temperature coke would be as efficient thermally as a coal-fired boiler.143. It is probable that higher efficiencies with coke-firing in general would be obtained by the use of boilers of the flue type rather than of the water-tube type, as the heat generated by coke is given off chiefly as radiant heat and there is little or no flame. In practice, however, the disadvantages of boilers of the flue type would prevent their adoption for large power stations. It is of course understood that in order to obtain the full rated evaporative output from a boiler fired with coke or coke breeze instead of coal, it is necessary to increase the grate area from 20 to 25 per cent, according to the design&apos; of the boiler.Gas-fir eel Boilers.144. Boilers, both of the Lancashire and water-tube types, fired with producer gas, coke-oven gas, and other gases have been in use for a number of years at collieries, ironworks, etc., and have given good results. The makers of the latter type of boiler do not claim an efficiency higher than about 70 per cent, when using gas, such as coke-oven gas; having a high; calorific value (500 to 550 B.Th.U. per cu. ft.). The Committee is of the opinion that with the addition of an economiser, the average working efficiency should rise to about 75 per cent., and this figure has been adopted. With producer gas or any gas having a calorific value below the range given above, the thermal efficiency decreases, and the heating surface of the boiler must be increased to obtain the same evaporation.145. Test efficiencies of over 90 per cent, have been obtained with gas-fired boilers of the Surface combustion type, and it is claimed that a working efficiency of 90 per cent, can be Secured when burning coke-oven gas and of 88 per cent, when burning producer gas. These figures relate to boilers without superheaters, as, so far, a satisfactory type of superheater for these boilers has not been produced. In the present design of boiler, no independent feed-water heater or economiser is used, as all the effective heat is taken out of the gases within the tubes. By far the greater part of the evaporation takes place at the front end of the boiler and the back end becomes, in effect, the feed-water heater.146. In view of the evident thermal advantages possessed by a gas-fired boiler of the surface combustion type, and of the extent to which gas-firing enters into various by-product power production schemes, the Committee has given very careful consideration to the matter. A special memorandum on the subject was prepared by a member of the Committee and is given in an Appendix (Appendix IV., p. 215). It suggests the general lines upon which a high-efficiency gas-fired boiler with superheater and feed water heater should be designed, and the Committee considers that a boiler of the kind indicated is well worth a trial upon a commercial scale.Standards of Comparison Adopted.147. The quality and character of the coal employed are important factors in all by-product recovery schemes, and it is only possible to make a fair comparison of them by adopting an arbitrary standard which can be applied consistently in all cases.148. It has been assumed, therefore, that the coal employed is of the requisite character containing not more than 8 per cent, of moisture, not more than 10 per cent.&apos;of ash, and not,less than 30 per cent, of volatile, the ash and volatile being reckoned on. the dry coal. More-over, the nitrogen content has been taken at 1&apos;3 per cent, and the calorific value of the coal as fired at 12,000 B.Th.U. per lb., corresponding to a caiorimetric value of, say, 13,500 B.Tli.TJ. per Hl oh the dry sample. This difference in calorific values is due in part to the presence of moisture in the coal as fired and in part to the presence of hydrogen which ultimately appears as steam. This steam cannot be condensed until it has left the boilers with the other flue gases, and its heat is not utilised in steam-raising although it appears in the caiorimetric measurement   The same effect gives rise to the difference between the gross and nett calorific! values in the case of gas for gas-firing.&quot;&apos; &quot; &quot;149. In dealing with, the application of by-product recovery schemes to power production &apos; on a scale of 100,000 kw. maximum demand, the quantities and costs involved in carbonisation and gasification processes have been expressed in terms of the kilowatt or kilowatt-year, thus enabling the figures to be directly applied to those previously given for a coal-fired station. &apos;&quot;.,&quot;. 150. It is important to note that the Committee, in combining the figures, has made no attempt to introduce all the adjustments that would be occasioned by the partial of total substitution of gas-firing for coal-firing in the power station. The principal items thus con-cerned are the capital outlay for plant for conveying coal and ash, for mechanical stokers and the like, and labour charges. The adjustments would vary somewhat according to the particular by-product recovery process adopted, but would not lead to any substantial modification in the figures -given later, which indicate the approximate results that might be anticipated in applying by-product recovery to power production on the scale specified.151. Supposing that the same quality of coal is suitable either for direct firing or for by-product recovery, the problem of power production with by-product recovery may in its simplest form be stated thus: Is&apos; the value of the by-products greater than, equal to; or less
than the necessarily increased cost of handling and treating the coal, together with the cost of the increased consumption of coal due to the thermal losses in the by-product recovery processes? , ,. . i:     I152. The salient figures resulting from a detailed investigation of the various methods of treating coal (Appendix IV.), together with the relevant figures for direct coal-firings are presented in a comparative manner in the tables given below. Attention is particularly directed to the fact that all figures for capital costs and working expenses are based upon pre-war conditions.Table 29.-THERMAL COMPARISON OP DIRECT FIRING AND BY-PRODUCT RECOVERYPOWER SCHEMES.Scale of complete Steam Turbo-Electric Installation in each, case taken at 100,000, kw.

Quality and Availability of Coal.153. It must be again emphasised that the general results to be expected by the application of by-product recovery to power production are primarily dependent upon the quality and price of the coal available. The figures given throughout this section of the Report are based upon the assumed employment of coal of a specified quality, and an indication is given in an Appendix (Appendix IV.) of the effect of variations in the amount of volatile, nitrogen, and ash contained in the coal.154. It has often been said that large quantities of good small coal suitable for by-product recovery schemes are left underground, and the Committee therefore approached the Coal Conservation Committee of the Ministry of Reconstruction with a view to obtaining the most recent data upon this question. The information furnished by the latter Committee has already been published (Final Report of the Coal Conservation Committee, Cd. 9084,1918), and indicates that the amount of small coal now left underground is far less than formerly. A considerable amount of inferior coal is cast back in certain coalfields, but the evidence available indicates that its content of ash is high, ranging from about 30 per cent, upwards, and it would be necessary to resort to washing before such coal could be satisfactorily utilised for by-product power schemes, thus adding to the costs involved. In evidence given before the Committee, it was stated on good authority that, in the case of fine coal containing about 20 per cent, of ash, it was difficult, even with the best coal-washing plant, to reduce the ash content to less than 6 or 8 per cent. Moreover, the results of an extensive series of coal-washing and grading trials, details of which were supplied to the Committee, show that the smaller grades are inferior to the larger coal from which they come, the ash being higher and the volatile lower. In the opinion of the Committee, the position appears to be that the coal cast back would, as a general rule, be equally suitable for use in other directions, and that no special claim can be made on behalf of by-product recovery schemes in this connection.Thermal Comparison of Power Schemes.155. It will be seen from Table 29 that the thermal efficiencies of carbonisation processes are substantially higher than those of processes involving the complete gasification of coal in one or two stages. In the latter, the large quantity of steam required in the producer blast for effecting the maximum recovery of ammonia, is an important factor in reducing the thermal economy of gasification, as indicated in detail in an Appendix (Appendix IV., Section III.). The cumulative effect of the thermal losses in the various stages of a complete power scheme utilising by-product recovery processes is such that&apos; the total con-sumption of coal becomes from 32 to 150 per cent, in excess of that required for direct coal-firing.Table 30.-YIELDS OF BY-PRODUCTS.

Conservation of By-products.* 150. From the point of view of the conservation of fixed nitrogen, the application to power production of the complete gasification of coal in one or two stages shows to out-standing advantage (see Table 30). This is due to the large yield of ammonia per ton of coal utilised, and to the low thermal efficiency of the processes and the consequent large consumption of coal per kw.-year. The maximum yield of all by-products is foreshadowed j by the two-stage process, but it has still to be substantiated by full-scale commercial operations that yields such as 2&apos;25 gallons of light spirit or 4&apos;5 gallons of benzol per ton Of coal can be realised in average practice by the carbonisation of coal at a low temperature, and that 65 per cent, or more of the nitrogen content of the low temperature coke can be consistently recovered as ammonia by gasification in recovery producers.Table 31.-NETT REVENUE FROM SALE OF BY-PRODUCTS ON BASIS OF DEFINITEVALUES.Scale of Installation and other Conditions as specified in Table 29.Items.

In dealing with the monetary value of the various by-products after making allowance for the costs of recovery and working-up, the nett revenues specified in Table 31 have been adopted in order to provide a basis for examining the financial aspects of the different power schemes. Having regard to the increasing demand for oil fuels and tar products, it is reasonable to assume that their market prices would fluctuate to a less extent than, that of ammonium sulphate which is faced with the competition of other nitrogenous fertilisers. The effect of variations in the market price of sulphate, and hence in the nett revenue obtainable from its sale, is dealt with in detail in an Appendix both in the text and upon the various charts that are given (Appendix IV). As will be apparent from foregoing remarks and-from Table 31, the market price Of sulphate is an important &quot;factor in power schemes involving the complete gasification of coal in one or two stages.

The additional capital expenditure incurred in applying by-product recovery processes at a large power station is very substantial, representing an increase of from 60 to 100 per cent, in the case of single-stage processes such as carbonisation or the gasification of coal in recovery producers (see Table 32). From the evidence available, it appears that the increased cost in the case of the two-stage process consisting of low temperature carbonisation followed by the gasification of the coke would be of the order of 200 per cent.Gross and Nett Cost of Coal.159. It is considered by some authorities that the class of coal suitable for by-product recovery processes will be purchasable after the war for 7s. bd, per ton in the neighbourhood of the pit. Having regard, however, to the fact that all by-product - power schemes are iaffected to a greater extent than direct firing by fluctuations in the price of coal and show to ;better advantage with coal at a low price, the Committee, in order not to&apos; over-estimate the possibilities of such schemes, has advisedly adopted the higher figure of 10s. per ton as the post-war price of suitable coal as it is certain that the increased cost of labour, taxation, and other items will require an increased charge to be made.160. The . opinion has been expressed on more than one occasion that in applying by-product recovery processes .to power production, the difference between the value of the by-products and the costs incurred in obtaining them would equate out the cost of the coal employed, the surplus fuel products such as coke or gas thus being without cost to the power plant. Upon the basis of the revenues and costs given in the above tables, the credit towards the cost of the coal (Table 33) in no case equates out the latter, although&apos;a substantial reduction of from 44 to 81 per cent, is indicated in the case of three different power schemes. It must be noted, however, that in tvvo cases the figures are based only upon the claims made for a low temperature carbonisation process that,has. still to be brought to a successful com-mercial stage. In order that the surplus fuel products might be without cost ,to the power plant, the cost of coal would have to range from 4 &quot;4s. to 8s. per ton delivered in the cases under review.

The costs of carbonisation or gasification are an important factor in all by-product power schemes. When taken in conjunction with the cost of the necessary coal, the total working expenses per kw.-year, including capital charges, become materially greater than those of a direct-fired station. It will be seen from Table 34 that with coal at 10s. per ton, the expenses are from 62 to 88 per cent, greater in the case of simple carbonisation processes, and about 123 per cent, greater for a single-stage gasification process. According to the evidence available, the total expenses of the two-stage gasification process previously mentioned would he about 200 to 240 per cent, greater than those for &quot;direct firing. It isdeaf that a really simple method of treating coal for by-product recovery, involving low costs for labour and repairs and low capital charges, must be devised if it is to be successful in reducing the cost of power. The Committee understands, that this aspect of the problem is being investigated by the Fuel Research Board of the Department of Scientific, and Industrial Research.      .. . ,! .       -: - , - Cost of Electrical Energy.  ; -162. From the, point of view of cheap electrical energy, it is apparent from Tables 33 and 34 and from the further details given in an Appendix (Appendix IV.) that with coal, at 10s. per ton and by-products at the nett values indicated, the three established methods of treating coal for by-product recovery stand at a disadvantage as compared with direct coal-firing.

The position is not altogether so unfavourable in the case of the complete gasification of coal in recovery producers, but it is clear that cheap coal, of the order of 7s. 6ci per ton, would be essential to enable the process to compete on a commercial basis with direct firing. In regard to the use of low temperature carbonisation, either alone or followed by the gasification of the resulting coke, the position is somewhat remarkable. Upon the basis of the unproved claims made for the two distinct methods of operation under review, the application,of one process to power production foreshadows a small financial gain or loss as compared with the cost of generation by direct firing, whereas a substantial gain of from 2&apos;J to 40 per cent, is foreshadowed in the
case of the second process according to the character of the complete power scheme. As previously remarked, the precise conditions of operation in regard to the temperature and duration of the carbonisation and also the character of the coal employed, have an important influence upon the yield and quality of the various fuel products and by-products. It is obvious, therefore, that very exact data are essential before the prospects of any by-product recovery process can be estimated with sufficient precision to permit of the recommendation of a particular scheme. Pending the results of full-scale commercial practice extending over an adequate period, it is only possible to state that the low temperature process for which the highest claims have been made may represent a potential method of effecting economies in the cost of generating electrical energy.Efficiency of Gas-firing.163. The figures given in the above tables are based upon an assumed thermal efficiency of 75 per cent, for gas-fired boilers. Gas-firing plays a relatively small part in some of the by-product power schemes (Table 29) and the position of these schemes would not be , materially improved by an increase in the efficiency of gas-firing. On the other hand, systems involving the complete gasification of coal in one or two stages, and therefore the use of gaseous fuel alone in the power station, would benefit considerably by the eventual development of high-pressure gas-fired boilers suitable for use in large power stations and having a thermal efficiency of, say, 90 per cent. The employment of such boilers would lead to a marked saving in capital expenditure, in operating costs, and in the consumption of coal. On account, however, of the consequent reduction in the yield of by-products, the higher efficiency would not necessarily result in a lower nett cost per kw.-year when the price of coal was low, but it would always lead to a lower nett cost when the price of coal was high. The power schemes would thus become less sensitive to variations in the price of coal with by-products at a definite value, and vice versa. These important facts are clearly shown by an examination of the charts given in an Appendix (Appendix IV.).Financial Limitations.164. Of the factors determining the cost of generation at a large coal-fired power station, the principal variable is the price of coal, which is almost certain to increase in the future as it has done over a period of years in the immediate past. In the case of all by-product power schemes, the future market prices of the by-products constitute further important variables Since a given variation in the price of coal has a greater effect upon such schemes than upon direct firing, it follows that whatever may be the value of the by-products recovered per ton of coal used, there is a limiting price of coal for each scheme beyond which direct firing is the cheaper for the production of power. The greater the value of the by-products, however, the higher is the limiting price of coal for a given scheme. These characteristics are indicated in Table 33, and on the charts given in an Appendix (Appendix IV.) It is specially to be noted that the schemes which give the highest yield of by-products also involve the largest consumption of coal, so that their financial stability over a period of years would be open to much greater uncertainty than that of direct coal-firing. From the financial point of view alone, the position would be more favourable for a scheme which yielded a smaller return of by-products from a lesser quantity of coal per kw.-year and was at the same time characterised by a reasonably high limiting price of coal. This combination of features is foreshadowed by the application to power production of a particular low temperature carbonisation process (System B.) without subsequent gasification of the coke, but the claims made for the process still remain to be substantiated in commercial working.Practical Considerations.165. It is essential to generate electricity in bulk and at a high annual load factor in order to secure the maximum economy. At the present time, the only industrial loads requiring a large supply of power at an annual load factor approximating to 100 per cent., are electro-chemical processes, such as the arc and calcium cyanamide processes. The figures previously given for direct coal-firing and for by-product power schemes would apply to cases of this kind only, and not to stations supplying ordinary industrial consumers at an annual load factor of, say, 50, or perhaps 60 per cent. With load factors of this order, or even less, the costs per unit output, or per full kw.-year, become larger, and the question of the applicability of by-product recovery processes becomes much more complicated, especially when large fluctuations in load have to be considered.166. These aspects of poAver production are dealt with on broad lines in an Appendix (Appendix IV.), and it is pointed out that for load factors substantially lower than 100 per cent, and of a variable character, the conditions are somewhat unfavourable for by-product schemes on account of the characteristics of the processes themselves, and of the large capital outlay involved. In the case, however, of a process which foreshadowed a distinct saving in the cost of generation at full load, it might be advantageous to instal sufficient carbonisation or gasification plant to. deal with the steady portion of the load of a large power station, such
plant being operated at its maximum capacity in order to ensure the most economical use of capital. The variable portion of the load would then have to be met by firing the remaining power plant with coal, coke, or even with gas from stand-by or overloaded producers. The precise combination of expedients offering the best financial advantage would have to be determined separately in each individual case from a knowledge of the average load and of the general shape of the load curve.167. It is important that attention should also be drawn to the enormous scale of the constructional work involved in adapting by-product recovery schemes to power production at large central supply stations. A, table is given in. an Appendix (Appendix IV., p. 201) indicating the quantities of coal and of secondary fuel products, such as coke and gas, that would have to be handled and otherwise disposed of per day and per annum at a station having a maximum demand of 100,000 kw. and an annual load factor of 100 per cent. The figures for coal are upon a&apos;parity with the requirements of the two largest individual gasworks in the world, while in the case of some of the by-product power schemes, the daily production of gas t would amount to from 400 to 500 million cubic feet, or from five to six times the maximum daily output of the largest individual gasworks in the world. In the light of figures of this character, it is evident that novel problems in design and control will have to be solved in applying by-product recovery processes at central supply stations. Although of necessity there will be an element of experiment in the first large scheme, its operation might be expected to provide the experience required for subsequent developments.National Aspects.168. From the national, as distinguished from the financial point of view, the two. principal considerations in connection with power schemes of the kind under review are (a) the yield of by-products, and (b) the extent to which coal must be used to secure these by-products as compared with the corresponding amount of coal required in direct firing.169. In the case of a power station of 100,000 kw. maximum demand operating at a load factor of 100 per cent., the annual consumption&apos;of coal by direct firing would be 650,000 tons. If by-product recovery processes were adopted, the quantity of coal required would vary from about 860,000 to 1,620,000 tons per annum according to the scheme selected. This coal would produce from 33,000 to 133,000 tons of tar which might be expected to yield from 9,500 to 38,500 tons of fuel oil, creosote, etc. The most- valuable by-product, however, is ammonium sulphate, and the annual production from a coal containing 1&quot; 3 per cent, of nitrogen would range Jrom 5,600 to 60,000 tons (Table 30), or from 1,150. to 12,300 metric tons of fixed nitrogen. As previously indicated, a power station loaded to 100,000 kw. and used for nitrogen fixation purposes could produce 11,890 metric tons of combined nitrogen as nitric acid if the arc process were employed, or 50,760 metric tons of combined nitrogen as calcium cyanamide if the cyanamide process were employed. In other words, the amount of nitrogen, recoverable from the coal may range from approximately 10 to 100 per cent, of that capable of being fixed by the arc process, and from approximately 2 to 24 per cent, of that capable of being fixed by the cyanamide process. Thus, the quantity of combined nitrogen recoverable from the coal is by no means negligible in any fixation or other electro-chemical process in which power is a serious factor in the cost of production.170.: With regard to the second point for consideration, the question arises whether it would be justifiable to use from 32 up to 150 per cent, more coal than that needed by direct firing for the purpose of obtaining the by-products. In this connection it must be remembered that the amount of coal at present used for power purposes under conditions which might permit of the application of. by-product recovery processes forms a comparatively small proportion of the country&apos;s output, namely, about 7*25 million tons in 1917-18 (for electricity supply, tramways, and electric railways) out of a total of about&apos;248 million tons. The per-centage increases referred to above would therefore have little effect upon reserves. The proportion of coal used for electrical power purposes will, however, become greater as time goes on.171. It is estimated that about 80 million tons of coal are consumed annually in the United Kingdom for the production of motive power alone, and that an annual saving of 55 million tons could be effected if power supply were dealt with on comprehensive lines and advantage taken of the most modern engineering developments (Interim Report on Electric Power Bupphj in Great Britain by the Coal Conservation 8ub-Committee of the Reconstruction Committee, Cd. 8880,1917). If it were ultimately found to be practicable to adapt by- product recovery processes to power production on the largest scale, the economies in coal consumption consequent upon the centralisation of power supply would more than counterbalance the percentage increases previously referred to.OFF-PEAK POWER FOR NITROGEN FIXATION.172. In the early stages of its enquiry, the Committee devoted very considerable attention to the possibility of utilising the off-peak power at the large existing electric supply stations in the United Kingdom for the operation of nitrogen fixation processes for war purposes.
As the result of an inquiry, it was found that the amount of olf-peak and continuous power available at any one place was small when considered in terms of combined nitrogen, and that the price of the electrical energy was on the high side for the purpose in view. Nevertheless, the Committee took steps to obtain an estimate of the cost of a unit lay-out arc furnace installation suitable for the largest blocks of power available, having in mind the fact that . the arc process is better adapted for intermittent working than any other of the established fixation processes. The estimate showed that the capital cost would have been heavy in proportion to that of an installation of the minimum economic size of 15,000 to 20,000 kw. capacity. -173. Even when allowance was made for the handicaps imposed by the price of the electrical energy and by the enhanced Capital charges and working expenses incurred through, intermittent working, it still appeared that the cost of the concentrated nitric acid obtained by the use of the oil-peak power would have shown a substantial reduction on the existing cost of manufacture by the retort process. As a war. emergency method of obtaining fixed nitrogen, the utilisation of off-peak power for the arc process therefore appeared to have some attractions, especially as the only capital expenditure involved would have been that for the chemical sections of the plant. Against these attractions, however, there had to be set considerations such as the difficulty of obtaining the necessary plant from overseas, the time and labour required for the construction and erection of the extensive chemical installations under war conditions, and the relatively insignificant, output of nitric acid to be obtained from the power then available.174. After carefully weighing the advantages and disadvantages indicated above, and taking into consideration the probability that the amount of off-peak power to be disposed of was soon likely to be required in other munition industries-as proved to be the case the Committee was unable to recommend the adoption of this particular expedient for obtaining combined nitrogen for war purposes. The possibility of utilising off-peak power for the commercial operation of the arc process in this country after the war is dealt with in the next section of the Report.GAS-ENGINES FOR LARGE AND SMALL POWER STATIONS.175. The largest gas-engine electric units hitherto installed commercially in this country have a capacity of under 4,000 kw., and consist in effect of two engines each having a capacity of less than 2,000 kw. The speed of large gas-engines is necessarily low, and on account of the size and weight of such engines, the space occupied by them is very consider-ahie and substantial foundations are required. In consequence, the capital cost of a large-scale gas-engine electric station would be very high; moreover, in the running of the plant, the multiplication of units would render the costs for labour and repairs excessive as compared with the corresponding costs for modern large steam-turbo units.176. In the opinion of the Committee, it would at the present time be entirely impracticable and uneconomical to employ gas-engines for power stations of the size necessary for the competi-tive operation of nitrogen fixation processes under British conditions. There is no immediate indication of such a revolution in the design of gas-engines as to lead to the hope of their employment in capital power stations.177. For small blocks of power, the position is much more favourable both as regards capital cost and operating costs, the latter being as low as or even lower than the corresponding costs for steam-engine plant.178. These considerations have an important bearing upon one aspect of the nitrogen problem to which the Committee has devoted much attention, namely, the possibility of utilising peat as a source of power and fixed nitrogen by gasifying the material under ammonia recovery conditions, and using the surplus gas as fuel for a gas-engine electric station. The various aspects of this problem are discussed in Appendices (Appendix IV., Section VII., and Appendix V., Section XIII.) and it is shown that some measure of success has already been obtained in other Countries where the conditions are favourable. A small gas-engine installation in Ireland, where the cost of coal is relatively high, has also been operated successfully by the use of peat fuel and gas producers without by-product recovery, but no really serious attempt on a scale comparable with that of the installations abroad, has yet been made in the United. Kingdom to generate power from peat and at the same time to recover by-products. . *179. The crux of the problem resides in the possibility of excavating and drying raw peat in large quantities throughout the year under varying climatic conditions and at a cost which will permit of the economic use of the resulting low grade peat fuel. Even when raw peat exceptionally low in moisture has been available and conditions have favoured open-air drying, difficulties have.been experienced in- producing sufficient quantities of peat fuel to maintain a power installation of moderate size in full operation. In the opinion of the Committee, there is little or no prospect under the climatic conditions prevailing in the United Kingdom of the successful use of natural air-drying alone as a method of meeting the fuel requirements of a by-product power installation of any magnitude. In spite of numerous attempts to devise an economical method of drying raw peat by artificial means, a solution of the problem still remains to be devised.  It is shown in an Appendix (Appendix IV.) that the prospects of
generating electrical energy on a moderate scale and at a reasonable cost by the gasification of peat under ammonia recovery conditions would be distinctly promising if an economical drying process were invented. With peat having a calorilic value of 8,500 B.Th.U. per lb. and a nitrogen content of 1&apos; 5 per cent, both reckoned on the dry material, and with a reasonable market price for the by-products, it might be possible for a peat installation to compete on a parity with other power stations of corresponding size. In the case of Ireland, where the cost of coal is relatively high, the position would probably be more favourable and there is no question that large possibilities are dependent upon the eventual success or otherwise of the efforts that will continue to be made to solve the problem of drying peat at a reasonable, cost.WATER POWER IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.180. During the course of the Committee&apos;s inquiry, an examination has been made of a num-ber of proposals submitted to the Munitions Inventions Department lor utilising water power in different parts of the United Kingdom for nitrogen fixation purposes. Although some of the proposals had promising features, only one of the schemes submitted could be said to present prima facie attractions for nitrogen fixation. This scheme was investigated in close detail and the locality was inspected by members of the Committee who were favourably impressed with the general outlines of the proposed water-power development. It was felt that the scheme represented a potential national asset of considerable value, irrespective of the purpose for which the power - might ultimately be used, and that its development would provide useful employment during the period of demobilisation.181. A memorandum embodying the conclusions of the Power Sub-Committee was there-fore submitted by the Chairman in July, l917, to the Right Hon. Winston S. Churchill, M.P., then Minister of Munitions. The memorandum recommended that a full survey of the drainage area in question should be made and a detailed estimate of the cost of development prepared. It was further recommended that in the event of the original estimates submitted to the Committee being confirmed, plans should be prepared in readiness for carrying out the development as a national asset immediately upon cessation of the war. The Minister of Munitions informed the Committee of his intention of placing the matter in the hands of the Minister of Reconstruction as the proposals were wholly of post-war significance. A request was subsequently received from the Minister of Reconstruction for more detailed information upon the proposed scheme in order that he might be in a position to arrive at a decision in the matter. A complete survey was therefore made and the estimate of cost pre-pared. The figures thus arrived at served to confirm the data originally submitted to the Committee.182. The following particulars afford an idea of the size and cost of the scheme. In the first place, continuous power of over 28,000 kw. is estimated to be available, and this could be further increased by bringing in adjoining watersheds. In the next place, the estimated cost of development upon the basis of an increase of 50 per cent, on actual pre-war contract prices, an increase that may reasonably be expected to represent post-war costs, amounts to  61 per effective kw., inclusive of hydraulic works, water rights, land, power station, electrical equip-ment and spare plant. Lastly, the estimated working costs, inclusive of repairs, maintenance and depreciation of the power-house plant and other works at 7&apos; 5 per cent, per annum, amor-tisation and occasional repairs u f hydraulic works at 1 per cent., and interest on capital at the rate of 4&apos;5 per cent, per annum, amount to  3&apos;93 per kw.-year of 8,760 hours. This figure may be compared with the estimated pre-war cost of  3&apos; 8 per kw. year of 8,760 hours by direct coal-firing with coal at 7s. tid. per ton (Table 27, p. 29). Under present conditions in regard to labour and the cost of materials, including coal, the figure for steam power will of course be much less favourable.18.3. It was recognised that the capital cost of the scheme as compared with that of many other water-powers, was on the high side. Nevertheless, its development, although involving a large investment upon permanent structures, would provide power at a rate as cheap as, or even cheaper than, the probable best steam practice. After full consideration of these points and of other factors such as the permanent value to the nation of developed water powers, the probable future cost of coal and labour, and the favourable situation of the proposed power house on the seaboard and in proximity to a railway, the Sub-Committee more particularly concerned with the investigation of this matter unanimously recommended the development of this water power after the war. This recommendation was transmitted by the Minister of Munitions to the Minister of Reconstruction in November, 1917.&apos;184. In consequence of the favourable outcome of the above investigation, passing consideration was given to the possible existence of other large undeveloped water-powers in the United Kingdom that might be well adapted for nitrogen fixation or other electro-chemical industries. It was realised that the field of enquiry was a large one and required the undivided attention of a specially-constituted organisation. No attempt was therefore made to carry the matter further, but the Power Sub-Committe recommended that: A thorough, investigation of these sources of power should be made at once. The necessary surveys would entail expenditure of money, but this would be worth while, and the results would be of great service to the Ministry of Reconstruction.
This recommendation was also brought to the notice of the Minister of Reconstruction, and the Committee is gratified to learn that as a result of subsequent negotiations, a Committee appointed by the President of the Board of Trade with -the concurrence of the Minister of Reconstruction, is now actively engaged upon an examination into the water-power resources of the United Kingdom, and has issued an Interim Report (Cmd. 79, 1919).OBSERVATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS.185. As a result of an enquiry into the question as to where and how large supplies of cheap power for nitrogen fixation purposes can. best be obtained in the United Kingdom, and also into the problem of conserving and increasing the national resources in nitrogenous and other by-products derivable from fuel used for power production, the Committee has arrived at the following conclusions : (a) The cheapest supply of power on a scale sufficient for the economical operation of the arc or calcium cyanamide processes is that foreshadowed by the water-power development previously referred to. The estimated cost under post-war conditions amounts to  3&apos; 93 per full kw.-year, and it is improbable that this low figure will be obtainable even by the best coal-fired power station practice when regard is had to the future cost of coal.The Committee only dealt with the question of water power to the extent of giving consideration to definite proposals submitted to the Munitions Inventions Department. The possible existence in the United Kingdom of other large powers capable of furnishing electrical energy at a cost as low as, or even lower than, that indicated above must therefore be recognised.(b) With regard to the production of power from coal, the only proved method of obtaining supplies of cheap power in bulk is by the use of direct coal-firing in conjunc-tion with modern large-sized steam turbo-electric generator units. For a power station having a maximum load of 100,000 kw. and an annual load factor of 100 per cent., the estimated cost upon a pre-war basis, with coal at 7s. 6d. per ton, amounts to  3 &quot;8 per per full kw.-year. For an annual load factor of 97&apos; 5 per cent., the corresponding estimate amounts to  3&apos;75 per kw.-year of 8,540 hours. If under post-war conditions coal were only obtainable for 10s. per ton, the figures would become  4&apos;58 and  4&apos;51 respectively. These take no account of possible increases in labour charges and in capital cost, but the effect of any given percentage increase can be readily deduced^    from the itemised statements in Tables 25 and 26.(c) In the present state of knowledge, the application of by-product recovery processes to power production upon a large, scale offers no immediate prospect of reducing the cost of electrical energy from coal below the figures attainable by direct coal-firing and the use of large steam turbo-electric units.(d) The employment of high temperature carbonisation as a stage in the produc-tion of power would be handicapped by capital ,and operating costs, and offers no prospect of competing upon a commercial basis with direct coal-firing. The process also compares unfavourably with other by-product recovery processes from the stand-point of the potential yield of nitrogenous and other by-products.(t?) The complete gasification of coal in a single stage in existing types of recovery producers if applied to power production on a large scale would offer little prospect of competing financially with direct coal-firing, because it is unlikely that coal would be obtainable at a sufficiently low price. Moreover, such a process would not permit of the recovery of oil and tar products to a satisfactory extent, although it would give a high yield of ammonia.(/) The maximum conservation of by-products is foreshadowed by a combination process involving the carbonisation of coal at a low temperature as a first stage and the complete gasification of the resulting coke under ammonia recovery conditions as a second stage. This holds good on the basis either of the lowest or of the highest yields claimed to be obtainable in the low temperature stage but not yet substantiated in commercial working.(g) According to the evidence available, the application to power production on a large scale of the combination process just referred to is likely to be handicapped by thermal inefficiency, by heavy capital expenditure, and by the sensitiveness of the power scheme to fluctuations in the price of coal and in the market prices of the by-products, particularly ammonium sulphate. Nevertheless, a substantial, reduction in the cost of electrical energy is foreshadowed, provided that the full-scale commercial operation of low temperature carbonisation over an adequate period establishes the validity of the estimated cost of operation and of yields approximating to the highest that are claimed to be obtainable. In this event, the application of low temperature carbonisation -tion alone to power production Avould also show financial economies as compared with direct coal-firing, although the total output of by-products would be much smaller per ton of coal utilised on account of the omission of the gasification stage. On the other hand, if the yields ultimately established do not exceed the lowest that areU  6619 D
claimed to be obtainable, the low temperature process, either alone or followed by the gasification of the resulting coke, would appear to offer little prospects of competing financially with direct firing for the production of power on a large scale.(h) Notwithstanding the divergent character of the results claimed to be obtainable by the carbonisation of coal at a low temperature, it is in this process that the main hope of obtaining cheaper power from coal appears to reside, apart, of course, from further economies in the cost of generation that might result from improvements in the thermal efficiency of steam power plant. Although many attempts have been made by private syndicates and others to devise a suitable plant for low temperature carbonisation, more particularly for the manufacture of a smokelees fuel for domestic and other purposes, a successful commercial type of plant has not yet been in operation. It cannot be said that the circumstances attending some of the efforts have been conducive to success, because the technical side of the problem appears to have been subordinated to other considerations.(i) In view of the national importance of developing cheap supplies of power for general industrial purposes, and having regard to the large amount of experimental work already carried out upon low temperature carbonisation, the Committee is strongly of the opinion that its feasibility and promise should be put to the test without delay by a thorough trial of any commercial plant that is installed in this country, and that such a trial should be organised and carried out with the national interests alone in view.(j) In the present state of the art, the employment of gas-engines for the production of power upon a scale sufficient for the economical operation of nitrogen fixation processes under British conditions cannot be regarded as practicable. For moderate blocks of power, however, the gas-engine stands to considerable advantage and can easily compete Avith. steam turbo-plant of corresponding size if supplied with gaseous fuel at a low price.(fe) There is no immediate prospect of utilising the extensive deposits of peat in&quot; the United Kingdom for the production of power with by-product recovery because success in this direction is essentially dependent upon the devising of a method of continuously obtaining and drying raw peat in quantity throughout the year at a cost which will permit of thedeliA^ery of the peat fuel&apos;to the power plant at a price of only a few shillings per ton. The continued upward trend in the price of coal and other fuel products will, however, have the effect of raising the economic limit for the cost of excavating and drying peat and of stimulating further attempts to solve the difficulty that has hitherto prevented any effective use being made of a large potential reserve of power and of combined nitrogen. Even if the problem should be solved, it is clear that operations upon a scale sufficient to meet the requirements of a large power station would be impracticable on account of the enormous quantities of peat fuel needed and the consequent serious annual drain upon even the most extensive of peat bogs. For power production upon a moderate scale by means of gas-engine plant, the prospect would be distinctly favourable, especially in the case of Ireland where the price of coal is relatively high and the loc*al output small.186. A brief reference must be made to certain considerations which have an important bearing upon the national and economic aspects of power production with by-product recovery. In the first place, there is no question that the continued prosperity of the United Kingdom is vitally dependent upon the utilisation of our coal resources to the maximum advantage, especially for the production of abundant supplies of cheap power for general industrial purposes. In the next place, the war has served to emphasize the fact that an abundant and cheap supply of nitrogenous fertilisers will be a fundamental requirement if the production of food both in this country and in others is to be rapidly increased to meet the world&apos;s urgent demand.187. From the figures previously given, it is apparent that the extensive application of by-product recovery processes to power production would result in a large percentage increase in the consumption of. coal per unit output of power as compared with the requirements of equivalent coal-fired power stations, and also in a very substantial addition to the home production of ammonium sulphate as well as of other by-products. It has been pointed out, however, that the economies consequent upon the centralisation of electric power generation, a course which has already been advocated as an immediate national necessity (Report on Electric Power Supply, Cd. 9062, 1918), would be so great that the application of by-product recovery processes under such circumstances would not increase the consumption of coal beyond the present figures.188. A large addition to the home output of ammonium sulphate, coupled with the increasing competition of synthetic nitrogen products, would undoubtedly cause a reduction in its market price, and this would be of advantage to agriculture and to the export trade. On the other hand, a sustained market price for by-products, such as ammonium sulphate, would constitute an essential factor in any margin in the cost of generation as between by-product power stations and coal-fired stations.   It is clear, therefore, that the financial
stability of by-product power schemes confronted with fluctuations both in the cost of coal and also in the market price of ammonium sulphate, and perhaps of other by-products, would be much less certain over a period of years than that of direct coal-firing. In these circum-stances, and having regard to the large capital commitment, it is open to question whether the inducements would be sufficiently strong to ensure the inauguration of large by-product , power schemes by private enterprise..189. It appears probable that undertakings of this character would have to receive the support of the Government or be carried out entirely as national projects. On account of the value of the by-products to the country, this course would be justifiable as long as the conditions permitted of the operation of the by-product power schemes at no substantial disadvantage as compared with direct coal-firing. It must be recognised, however, that a time might come when the price of coal and further developments in the manufacture of various chemical products by synthetic methods would render it altogether uneconomical to apply by-product recovery processes to the production of power. In this event it would clearly be unjustifiable, even as a national measure, to sacrifice the advantages of direct coal-firing for the purpose of conserving products that could be obtained more economically by other methods.V. THE ECONOMICS OF THE ESTABLISHED PROCESSES.190. As the result of a critical analysis of a large amount of evidence, much of which is of unquestionable authority, upon the important question of costs, the Committee has been able to prepare reasoned estimates of the capital expenditure and working costs that would probably be involved in operating the established processes to an adequate extent in the United Kingdom upon the basis of pre-war manufacturing conditions. It must be emphasised that the costs at the -factory which are given in this section of the Report do not include any allowance for interest on the capital cost of the chemical installations, for the cost of marketing, for profit, or for royalties or like payments (see par. 32).COST OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY.191. The cost of electrical energy is the vital factor in the arc process and an important consideration in the case of the cyanamide process. In order, therefore, to secure the maximum economy in the operation of these processes under British conditions with steam-generated power, the chemical factories would have to be associated either with ad hoc power stations of large size, or with central supply stations generating electricity in bulk for general industrial purposes. It has already been shown that in the present state of our knowledge there is no immediate prospect of obtaining electrical energy from coal in this country at a lower cost than that capable of being realised by direct firing and the employment of the most modern large-scale steam turbo-electric units. According to the considered estimate of the Committee, the pre-war cost of generation at a direct coal-fired station having a maximum load of 100,000 kw. and operating at a load factor of 97&apos;5 per cent. (8,540 hours per annum), would, with coal at 7s. 63. per ton, amount to  3&apos;75 per kw.-year at the switch-board, inclusive of depreciation and of interest on capital. This figure has consequently been adopted as a basic one for the &quot; possible &quot; cost of electrical energy for operating nitrogen fixation processes on a substantial scale in the United Kingdom -and under the conditions prevailing in the pre-war period.192. The influence of more costly electrical energy is indicated in dealing with the different processes, and for purposes of comparison the basic figure for British conditions has been contrasted with a figure of  1&quot; 2 per kw.-year for exceptionally favourable water powers in Norway, and with a figure of  2 per kw.-year for the average price at which energy is purchasable at the more recently developed hydro-electric installations in that country.193. The estimated pre-war capital cost of a steam-power station of the size specified above, namely  10&apos;26 per kw. of maximum load, has also been adopted in dealing with the total capital outlay required for the installation of nitrogen fixation plants in this country.194. The conclusions of the Committee concerning the salient features of the established processes, such as their power requirements, the quantities and costs of the necessary raw materials, and the capital outlay and manufacturing costs, are summarised below, and a separate subsection is devoted to the by-products obtainable. The technical details of the processes are only referred to in cases where they have an important bearing upon the question of costs, and are dealt with more fully in an Appendix (Appendix V.). After a brief considera-tion of each process, the figures for capital expenditure and manufacturing costs are presented in a comparative manner in Tables 35 and 36 which embody corresponding data for the standard non-synthetic processes and constitute an essential feature of this Report.D
THE ARC PROCESS.195. This synthetic process (Appendix V., Section HI.) involves the direct combination of atmospheric nitrogen and oxygen by the heat of the electric arc and the absorption of the resulting oxides of nitrogen in water and subsequently in alkali. The primary product of absorption is dilute nitric acid of 30 to 40 per cent, strength, but about 15 per cent, of the total nitrogen fixed is absorbed in the alkali towers and can be recovered as sodium nitrate. The dilute acid can be concentrated further if desired, or neutralised with an appropriate base for the production of solid nitrate salts, such as nitrate of lime or ammonium nitrate. The process is simple and continuous in operation, air and water being the principal raw materials.196. The most striking characteristics of the process as hitherto developed in countries where cheap water-power is available are: (a) The large power requirements per unit of nitrogen fixed ;(6) The low electro-chemical efficiency; and(c) The extensive and costly character of the absorption plant.Power Requirements and Output of Product.197. After a careful examination of the evidence ascjto power requirements, the Committee has come to the conclusion that when full allowance is made for losses during the absorption and concentration stages, the final output of marketable products expressed as the equivalent of 100 per cent, nitric acid will amount to a minimum of 535 kg. HN03 per kw.-year of 8,760 hours measured at the station switchboard, or 61 gm. of HN03 per kw.-hour. The consumption of energy thus amounts to 1&apos; 87 kw.-years per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per&apos; cent.), or to 8&apos;41 kw.-years per metric ton of fixed nitrogen recovered. There are reasonable grounds for believing that with modern large-scale electric furnaces the yield might be about 10 to 15 per cent, higher and the power requirements thus correspondingly smaller, but the Committee has advisedly adopted a conservative figure that can be safely realised in ordinary working practice.s   Low Efficiency of the Arc Process.198. The inefficiency of the process from the electro-chemical standpoint is apparent when it is stated that only 3 or 4 per cent, of the electrical energy supplied is ultimately used in the actual union of nitrogen and oxygen. About 90 per cent, of the energy is represented by the sensible heat of the furnace gases, and in the case of large modern furnaces of 3,000 to 4,000 kw. capacity, the steam-raising value of the gases is considerable. In practice, the steam raised is at least sufficient to meet all the requirements of the auxiliary plant of the arc furnace installation as well as of all the evaporating and concentrating apparatus; alter-natively, about 13 per cent, of the applied energy can be regenerated if the whole of the steam is utilised in steam turbo-electric plant.Absorption Plant.199. Extremely large volumes of gases containing a very small percentage of oxides of nitrogen have to be dealt with in the absorption plant, and the time required for the various chemical reactions leading to the formation of nitric acid is the fundamental factor in determining the cubical capacity of the plant (Appendix V., Section III.). Until the present system of water absorption is superseded by some other method of recovering the fixed nitrogen in the gases, extensive and therefore costly absorption plant is essential.Capital Cost.200. The total capital outlay for a large-scale-factory for the production of concentrated (93 to 96 per cent.) nitric acid would amount to  178 per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum, or nearly twice the pre-war market value of the annual production. Of this sum, the arc furnace, absorption and concentrating plant would account for about  92, and the steam-power section for about  86. The cost of the chemical sections of the factory is based upon Norwegian practice and is possibly on the high side for a plant erected under British conditions; the Committee therefore considers that it can be taken as a safe maximum value. In the case of an installation for manufacturing solid nitrate of lime instead of concentrated acid, the total capital outlay would be approximately the same as above.Production vCost of Nitric Acid.201. Notwithstanding the handicaps indicated above, the arc process, with electrical energy at  3*75 per kw.-year, could produce concentrated (93 to 96 per cent.) nitric acid at a cost, at the factory, of  11&apos;5 per metric ton of HN03 (calculated at 100 per cent.) or about half the cost by the Chile nitrate retort process, namely,  22 &quot;3 per metric ton of HN03. For every additional  1 per kw.-year in the cost of electrical energy, the production costs by the
arc process would be increased by  1 * 87 per metric ton of HN03 (Appendix V., Section III., and Chart A). As long as the cost of energy is below ; 9 per kw.-year, the process even when allowance is made for interest at the rate of 5 per cent, upon the heavy capital cost of the arc furnace installation would stand to advantage as compared with the retort process. The production cost of concentrated acid at a very favourable water-power site would be about  6 &quot;7 per metric ton of HNQ3) or 40 per cent, less than at a large factory operating with eteam-generated power in this country.Possibilities of the Process.202. The arc process is the most direct of all the synthetic methods of manufacturing nitric acid, and any substantial improvement upon its present low degree of efficiency would have a marked effect upon the capital and production costs. The incentive to improvement has not hitherto been pressing, as the process has only been installed where cheap hydro-electric energy is available. If, however, the process were domiciled in this country, it is almost certain that the stimulus of relatively costly electrical energy would lead to definite &apos; advances in methods of working, and thus to increases in the output for the energy consumed. The process is better adapted for intermittent working than any other established synthetic process, and successful use has been made of off-peak power at arc-furnace installations in Italy. If the recommendations put forward in the Report of a Committee appointed - by the Board of Trade to consider the question of electric power supply in the United Kingdom [Cd. 9062, 1918J, lead to the establishment after the war of large central supply stations for general distribution purposes, the arc process might provide a useful outlet for a substantial block of off-peak&apos; power, and be well worthy of consideration as a commercial proposition for the manufacture of nitric acid.Production Costs of Synthetic Nitrates.203. With regard to the manufacture of synthetic nitrates on a large scale by means of the arc process, the expenses incurred in converting the dilute acid into a solid salt packed for the market entail a substantial addition to the cost of the originalhitrie nitrogen, notwith-standing the fact that waste heat is available for evaporating purposes. The additional cost per metric ton of combined nitrogen obtained amounts to about  16 in the case of nitrate of lime and to about  17 in the case of sodium nitrate (with soda ash at  3 per metric ton). In the case of ammonium nitrate, the conversion cost, exclusive of that of the ammonia itself and of losses in the process, amounts to about  4&apos;3 per metric ton of combined nitrogen in the form of unpacked product. Under British conditions with electrical energy at  3&apos;75 per k.w.-year, the total cost at the factory of manufacturing nitrate of lime and sodium nitrate would amount to  58&apos; 8 and  60&quot; 3 respectively per metric ton. of fixed nitrogen, packed for the market. If soda ash were obtainable for  1&apos;5 instead of  3 per metric ton, the figure for sodium nitrate would be reduced to  54&apos; 5. When an allowance is made for interest upon the capital cost of the chemical plant, for the cost of marketing, and for profit, these figures show little or no margin as compared with the pre-war market price of combined nitrogen in the form of Chile nitrate, namely,  67 per metric ton. On the other hand, it appears that nitrate of lime can be manufactured under conditions where cheap water power is available, as in Norway, at a cost, at the factory, of from  37 to  44 per metric ton of fixed nitrogen packed for the market.&apos;Dry Absorption Process.204. Prior to the war, efforts were being made to avoid *the intermediate production of dilute nitric acid, and to obtain a solid nitrate of lime direct by the passage of the arc furnace gases through specially prepared quicklime. According to the evidence available to the Committee, the trials carried out upon this process were considered to have given such satisfactory results, that plans were being prepared for testing it on a much larger scale.. Nitrate of lime has a high value as a fertiliser, but its extended use has hitherto been hampered by the hygroscopic character of the product. If this drawback can be overcome, there would appear to be a strong inducement to develop the dry absorption process, which is stated to yield a product containing from 14 to 14&apos;5 per cent, of fixed nitrogen, as compared with about 13 per cent, in the case of nitrate of lime manufactured by the neutralisation process (Appendix V., Section III.).THE CALCIUM CYANAMIDE PROCESS.205. Calcium cyanamide (Appendix 7.,fSectibn V.) is obtained by the treatment of finely ground calcium carbide with nitrogen gas at an elevated temperature. The complete process is a somewhat elaborate one involving, as a first stage, the manufacture of calcium carbide by heating a mixture of anthracite, or coke and lime in an electric furnace, and the subsequent conversion of the product into calcium cyanamide in a separate furnace. The nitrogen gas is usually separated from the atmosphere by one or other of the air liquefaction processes.U  6619 D 3
206. The main characteristics of the cyanamide process are : (a) The relatively small power requirements per unit of &quot;nitrogen fixed as contrasted with those of the arc process.(b) The direct production of a solid nitrogenous fertiliser, thus avoiding the costs incurred in all the other established synthetic processes for converting liquid products into a solid marketable form.(c) The production of a cheaper marketable form of combined nitrogen than is obtainable by any other established fixation process.(d) Its great adaptability as regards the products obtainable.Power Requirements.207. The power requirements of the cyanamide process in its latest development amount to about 16&apos;5 kw.-hours per kg. of nitrogen fixed, or about 2 kw.-years (of 8,400-8,500 hours) per metric ton of combined nitrogen.   This figure is inclusive of the requirements of the . carbide stage, of the nitrogen plant, of the cyanamide furnaces, and of the necessary crushing and grinding plant.Raw Materials.208. Abundant supplies of limestone and anthracite of the quality necessary for the manufacture of carbide and cyanamide are available in the United Kingdom. It is important to note, however, that evidence available to the Committee indicates that the quality of the raw materials required for the manufacture of carbide for conversion into calcium cyanamide, as contrasted with that of carbide for lighting and welding purposes, is probably not so high as has hitherto been considered necessary. Upon the basis of pre-war conditions, the cost of the materials delivered at a favourably situated factory should not exceed 16s. per metric ton for anthracite and 15s. per metric ton for lime. The quantities required for the production of a metric ton of cyanamide amount to from 450 to 500 kg. of anthracite and from 700 to 750 kg. of lime, according to the manufacturing practice adopted.209. The cost of separating nitrogen from the air by means of liquefaction plants is well established on account of the extensive use already made of such plants. The Committee considers that 6d. per 1,000 cubic feet of nitrogen is a safe maximum value for the working costs of a large-scale plant, inclusive of power requirements and of depreciation. Allowing for a loss of 25 to 30 per cent, of unabsorbed nitrogen in the cyanamide stage, the working costs of the nitrogen plant amount to less than 4s. per metric ton of cyanamide obtained, and are therefore a relatively unimportant, item in the total cost of manufacture.210. The possibilities attaching to the recovery and utilisation of oxygen and other by-products in the operation of the nitrogen plant are dealt with under a later subheading. It must be pointed out at this stage that the figures given below are exclusive of any credit for the value of the by-products.Capital Cost.211. The total capital outlay for a large-scale cyanamide factory under British conditions would amount to about  45 per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum,.or less than the pre-war market value of the annual production. Of this sum, the complete carbide and cyanamide installation would account for about  25, and the steam power section for about  20.Production Cost.212. The estimated production cost, at the factory, with electrical energy at  3&apos; 75 per kw.-year, would amount to about  24 per metric ton of fixed nitrogen in the form of raw cyanamide. For every additional  1 per kw.-year in the cost of electrical energy, the produc-tion cost would be increased by about  2 per metric ton of fixed nitrogen ; for example, with energy at  6 per kw.-year, the factory cost would become  28&apos;4 (Appendix V., Section V, and Chart B). The after-treatment of the raw product with oil and water for converting it into a form (nitrolim) suitable for manurial purposes is an inexpensive operation costing about  1 per metric ton of fixed nitrogen, and the cost of packing is of the order of  2 per metric ton of nitrogen. Even when further allowances are made for interest on the capital cost of the chemical plant, for marketing, and for profit, there is still a very substantial margin as compared with the pre-war market price of fixed nitrogen in the forms of Chile nitrate and ammonium sulphate, namely,  67 and  66 respectively per metric ton.Adaptability of the Process.:&apos; 213: The adaptability of the calcium, cyanamide process is evidenced by the fact that the product constitutes a raw material for the manufacture of crude cyanides and of valuable organic compounds such as dicyandiamide, guanidine, urea and nitrate of urea the latter
being a product of growing importance. Further, the process not only involves the manufac-ture of an intermediate product calcium carbide-the demand for which is steadily increasing ,on account of the wider uses found for it, but also provides a ready, although indirect, method of obtaining ammonia by the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen on account of the facility with which cyanamide can be decomposed to yield its combined nitrogen in the form of ammonia.Ammonia from Oyanamide. 1-214. During the war period cyanamide has been mainly utilised as a method of obtaining ammonia for munitions, and the process has been developed on a large scale in several countries for this particular purpose. The combined nitrogen of cyanamide is readily obtained in the form of ammonia by treating the product in an autoclave with steam under pressure, the reaction being facilitated by the addition of small quantities of caustic lime and soda ash. The conversion process is a comparatively simple operation, but large quantities of waste lime sludge are obtained and have to be disposed of (Appendix V., Section VI.)..Capital Cost. The total capital cost under British conditions of a complete carbide, cyanamide, and ammonia factory of a large size would amount to about  54 per metric ton of ammonia nitrogen per annum, the steam-power section accounting for about  21 of this sum. The additional outlay for sulphuric acid, and sulphate plant for fixing the ammonia would bring the total capital cost to about  68 per metric; ton of fixed nitrogen per annum. In each case the expenditure is on a parity with the pre-war market value of the annual production.Production Cost. Upon the basis of electrical energy at  3&apos; 75 per kw.-year, the estimated production costs, at the factory, of pure ammonia liquor and of ammonium sulphate packed for the market would amount to about  29 and  38 respectively per metric ton of combined nitrogen in the forms of the products named, and each additional  1 per kw.-year in the cost of energy would increase the production costs by about  2 per metric ton of fixed nitrogen (Appendix V., Section VI, and Chart B.). When allowance is made for further charges for interest, marketing, and profit, the figures still show a considerable margin over the pre-war market prices of the corresponding forms of combined nitrogen, namely,  61&apos;6 (as pure ammonia spirit) and  66 (as ammonium sulphate) per metric ton. They also reveal the fact that the extra capital and worldug expenses incurred in fixing a pure strong ammonia on a large scale, and in obtaining a solid product packed for the market, are by no means inconsiderable.Calcium Carbide.215. Calcium carbide, the intermediate product in the manufacture of cyariamide, is of considerable commercial importance. The demand for this product in connection with rexyacetylene welding and metal-cutting and for lighting purposes is rapidly increasing, and there. have been.important recent developments in its utilisation as a raw material for the . manufacture of synthetic aldehyde, acetic acid, and acetone, which are essential for munitions, ,and are largely used in various industries. These considerations emphasise the attractiveness of combining the manufacture of carbide for sale with that of cyanamide, and operations of this character have already been practised abroad. There are also advantages and economies to be gained by such a procedure. For example, in the manufacture of high-grade carbide for lighting and welding purposes, the saleable output is reduced by some 4 or 5 per cent, owing to the formation of dust during the crushing of the raw fused carbide; this dust, however, would be utilised in the cyanamide furnaces if the latter product Avere made at the same factory.Power Requirements. According to the best modern practice in carbide making, the poAver requirements per metric ton are somewhat less than O&apos;0 kw.-year of 8,400-8,500 hours.Capital and Production Costs&apos;. Under British conditions, Avith electrical energy at  3&apos; 75 per kw.-year, the Committee estimates that the production cost of unpacked carbide at a large-scale Avell-arranged factory equipped with modern labour-saving appliances, would amount to about  5 per metric ton. An increase of  1 per lav.-year in the cost of energy would add about 10s. to the production costs. The cost of packing the product in drums would amount to about  1*5 per metric ton. The capital outlay for a large-scale carbide factory Avith a steam turbo-electric power section Avould be of the order of  8 to  9 per metric ton of carbide per annum (Appendix V., Section V.).216. It may be noted that the annual importation of carbide into the United Kingdom amounts to about 26,000 tons.Observations.   1217. To sum up, the higher cost of electrical energy under British conditions, although an important factor from the point of vieAV of foreign competition, is to a large extent off-set by other favourable factors, such as cheap and abundant raw materials and the elimination of sea freights. There seems no reason why the manufacture both of carbide and also of calcium cyanamide, if laid out on a large scale, should not be successful in this country. There are blocks of - undeveloped water power in Scotland of sufficient size for the operation of a large factory.*  d i
THE HABER PROCESS.218. According to this process (Appendix V., Section IV.), the synthesis of ammonia is effected continuously by passing a suitably proportioned mixture of hydrogen and nitrogen at a pressure of from 100 to 200 atmospheres over a catalyst heated to about 55Q0 C. The ammonia as it is formed is removed by refrigeration or by absorption in water, and the unconverted gases are returned to the plant for further treatment. In respect of the conjoint use of a very high pressure and an elevated temperature, the process differs fundamentally from any manufacturing operation hitherto carried out on a large scale; in other respects it is mainly a question of the production, compression, and circulation of very large quantities of gases, about 77,000 cubic feet of hydrogen and 26,000 cubic feet of nitrogen being required for the production of a metric ton of ammonia, allowing for losses during the synthesis.219. The commercial development of the Haber process has been entirely confined to Germany, and considerable secrecy has been observed as to its details. The Committee has experienced difficulty in estimating the degree of reliability to be accorded to the evidence oil costs that has been obtained, but the results gained from the research work carried out under the direction of the Committee have provided assistance in the formation of tentative conclusions.220. The economics of the process are principally governed by (a) The cost of the gases, particularly that of hydrogen of the requisite degree of purity.(b) The capital cost of the catalyst or high-pressure section of the plant and the cost of its maintenance.Nitrogen.221. The cost of separating nitrogen from the air has been indicated in connection with the calcium cyanamide process. At Qd. per 1,000 cubic feet, the nitrogen used in the synthesis of a metric ton of ammonia would cost about 13s. and represents a small item only in the total production costs.Hydrogen.222. The cost of the hydrogen, on the other hand, is the vital factor, and every increase or reduction of 6ci per 1,000 cubic feet in. the cost of this gas affects the cost of the synthetic ammonia to the extent of over  1&apos;9 per metric ton. The Committee has investigated in considerable detail the possibilities of the various processes adapted for the manufacture of pure hydrogen on a large scale, such as the electrolytic, steam-iron, and water-gas catalytic processes, and is of the opinion that the latter is the most promising of existing methods for obtaining a cheap and pure hydrogen. The Committee has also come to the conclusion that it should be possible to manufacture hydrogen of the necessary purity on a large scale by means of this process at a cost of 2s. 6d. per 1,000 cubic feet delivered under compression to the catalyst section of the ammonia plant. The hydrogen used in the synthesis of a metric ton of ammonia would thus represent a charge of about  9&apos; 6, by far the largest item in the total production costs quoted below. The question of utilising the by-product hydrogen obtained in the manufacture of electrolytic alkali and in other industries was considered, but the quantities available were found to be not very large when measured in terms of ammonia. It may be noted that considerable quantities of carbon dioxide are obtained as a by-product in the operation of the water-gas catalytic hydrogen process, and this point is referred to on page 59.Power Requirements.223. The power requirements of the process are smaller than those of any other established method of fixing nitrogen. Assuming the whole of the requirements to be met electrically, which is not essential, the Committee estimates from the data available that the manufacture, compression, and circulation of the gases and the heating of the catalyst would entail the consumption of approximately 3,000 kw.-hours per metric ton of ammonia produced per hour, or, say, 0&apos;42 kw.-year of 8,500 hours per metric ton of combined nitrogen. This figure has been adopted in dealing with the question of costs, but is put forward by the Committee with reserve.Capital Cost.224. The capital cost of the catalyst section of the plant depends to an important extent upon the space-time-yield of commercially practicable high-pressure units., i.e., upon the output per unit of time per unit of catalyst space, since this factor governs the number of units required for a given production. With a space-time-yield of the order definitely shown by the research work to be attainable, the total capital outlay for a synthetic ammonia factory, inclusive of hydrogen and nitrogen sections, would probably be of the order of  48 per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum, or less than the pre-war market, value of the annual production. It is estimated that the hydrogen section with compressors and buildings would account for nearly one half of the outlay.   The addition of sulphuric acid and sulphate
sections for fixing the ammonia would increase the capital cost to  63 per metric ton of fixed nitrogen per annum.Production Costs.225. Given a method of manufacturing pure hydrogen at a cost not exceeding 2s. Qd. oer 1,000 cubic feet a figure which the Committee considers will ultimately be realised tkure seems no doubt that the Haber process is capable of producing pure ammonia at a cost, at the factory, of about  17 or less per metric ton, equivalent to about  20 per metric ton of, fixed nitrogen, which is below that of any existing ammonia process. The cost of maintenance of the catalyst section is an uncertain item in the above figure, since it can only be accurately ascertained as the result of several years&apos; working. Having regard to the special character of the high-pressure plant, an allowance of 10 per cent, upon its capital cost has been included for repairs, and the Committee considers that this should be a reasonably safe maximum. The conversion of the ammonia into sulphate, including packing, increases the total factory cost to about  29 per metric ton of fixed nitrogen, equivalent to about  6 per metric ton of ammonium sulphate, which shows a very substantial margin as compared with the pre-war market price of the product, namely,  13&apos;6 per metric ton.Observations.226. The Haber process can thus produce a marketable form of combined nitrogen at a cost upon a parity with that of the calcium cyanamide process utilising energy at  3&apos; 75 per kw.-year, although the latter process shows an advantage when cheap water-power is available.227. On account of the purity of synthetic ammonia, the Haber process is specially suitable for use in conjunction with the ammonia oxidation process for the manufacture of nitric acid and ammonium nitrate.THE AMMONIA OXIDATION PROCESS.228. Gaseous ammonia in the presence of air and a suitable catalyst undergoes oxidation with the formation of oxides of nitrogen and moisture (Appendix V., Section VII.). The oxides can be recovered by water absorption, as in the case of the arc process, yielding a dilute nitric acid of 50 to 53 per cent, strength, or by absorption in a solution of alkali, yielding a nitrate. The dilute acid can be concentrated further if desired or neutralised for the production of nitrates.229. Prior to the war, the retort (Chile nitrate) process and the arc process were the only fully-established methods of producing nitric acid. The ammonia oxidation process thus opens up a further source of supply, although, from the commercial point of view, the process is still in its infancy, its large-scale development having been a direct outcome of the war demand for nitric nitrogen. In Germany the process, has attained a position of vital im-portance and has constituted practically the only method of obtaining nitric acid for military requirements since the cessation of imports of Chile nitrate and the exhaustion of her home stocks of that product. The experience gained with modern types of ammonia oxidation con-verters using platinum gauze as a catalyst is of too recent a date to have enabled questions such as the best and most economical types of plant and methods of working to be definitely settled. In face of pressing military demands, economy in construction and operation has been subordinated to expediency, and it is therefore difficult to assess, from a pre-war stand-point, the value of evidence based upon the operation of plants erected during the war period. The process, however, presents some analogies with the arc process, and these, together with the results obtained from the research work carried out under the direction of the Committee, have afforded assistance in basing conclusions on the somewhat uncertain figures available on the question of costs. It is reported that a new process involving the oxidation of ammonia in solution has been worked out in Sweden. . The Committee took steps to obtain particulars of this process, but no technical details have become available.230. The principal characteristics of the ammonia oxidation process are : (a) The small power requirements even when electrically heated platinum gauze is employed as the catalyst.(b) The necessity, if a high overall efficiency is to be secured, for a comparatively large recovery plant when water absorption is employed.(c) The moderate capital and working&apos;costs of the latest types of plants.&apos;  (d) The adaptability of the process for manufacturing nitrates, such as ammonium nitrate.Power Requirements.231. Power is mainly required for the fans, blowers, and pumps used for circulating the gases and the solutions in the absorption towers, and an allowance of 150 kw.-hours per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) in the form of dilute acid is probably an ample
maximum for a large-scale plant. The equivalent figure per metric ton of combined nitrogen recovered as dilute acid is 0&apos;08 kw.-year of 8,500 hours..    . Absorption Plant.232. As in the case of the arc process, the time required for the chemical reactions leading to the formation of nitric acid governs the cubical capacity of the absorption plant. Owing, however, to the fact that the gases from the converters contain about 10 per cent, by volume of oxides of nitrogen, as compared with about 1 &apos;25 per cent, in arc furnace gases, it is possible to use smaller towers than would be necessary for an arc furnace plant of equivalent output, and at the same time to recover a somewhat stronger acid, namely, of 50 to 53 per cent, strength, as against an acid of 30 to 40 per cent, by the arc process; On the other hand, there is no body of waste heat available for evaporating and concentrating purposes, and fuel has therefore to be used for these operations. With modern types of converters and a well-designed absorption plant, the Committee considers that an overall nitrogen efficiency of 90 per cent, (reckoned on the input of ammonia gas and the output of dilute nitric acid) should be obtained, corresponding to the production of a metric ton of 1TN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) in the form of dilute acid from 0&apos;3 metric ton of ammonia (calculated as 100 per cent.).Nitric Acid.233. As compared, with the types of converter originally employed, the recent develop-nients in platinum gauze converters are characterised by a marked simplification in construction, a reduction in the quantity of platinum required, and a large increase in the output per unit of plant, namely, from about 30 to as much as 300 metric tons of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) per annum. These factors influence the capital cost, which could be further reduced under British conditions by the employment of stoneware absorption towers instead of costly granite towers of the type used at arc furnace installations in Norway.Capital Cost-After a careful examination of the evidence, the Committee considers that the capital outlay for a large-scale plant, exclusive of the ammonia-producing section, for manufacturing concentrated (93 to 96.per cent.) nitric acid will amount toabout  8 per metric ton of IiN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) per annum The addition of plant for producing the necessary purified ammonia from concentrated gas liquor would bring the cost of the complete factory to  10&apos;6 per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) per annum. If the ammonia oxidation process were used as an adjunct to the Haber or cyanamide processes for the conversion of the ammonia into concentrated nitric acid, the overall capital expenditure in the two cases would be about  20 and  22 respectively per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) per annum. 1Production Cost. The actual working costs of the process, apart from the cost of the ammonia and losses in conversion, are probably as low as, or even lower than, those of the arc process. The Committee is of the opinion that for a large-scale plant they should not exceed  2 and  4&apos;5 per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as. 100 per cent.) for dilute and concentrated acid respectively. With the cheapest synthetic ammonia, the process is capable of yielding concentrated nitric acid at an estimated cost, at the factory, of  9&apos; 4 to  9&apos; 8 per metric ton of IiN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.). Even with by-product ammonia charged at its full pre-war market price and with full allowances for the costs and losses involved in its concentration and purification, the process still appears capable of yielding concentrated nitric acid for about  20 per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.), as compared with a cost of  22&apos;3 by the Chile nitrate retort process. It is important to note that the cost of converting, a pure strong ammonia into concentrated nitric acid, for which the peace-time demand is relatively small, is substantially higher than the cost of converting it into ammonium sulphate, for which there is a very large market, the respective&apos; figures being about  20 and  8&apos; 6 per metric ton of combined nitrogen.Ammonium Nitrate.234. The process is well adapted for the manufacture of ammonium nitrate, and an extension of the markets for this product, coupled with cheap sources of ammonia, would be favourable to its commercial development after the war.;,, Capital Cost.-The capital outlay for a factory is largely influenced by the character of the ammonia-producing section. If plant for utilising concentrated by-product ammonia were employed, the total capital cost would amount to about  28&apos; 5 per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum; with sections for producing the ammonia by the Haber or cyanamide processes, the corresponding figures would be about  69 and  75.Production Cost. When synthetic ammonia is used, the estimated production cost, at the factory, varies from about  11 per metric ton of ammonium nitrate in the case of the Haber process to about  14/5 in the case of the cyanamide process.with electrical energy at  3&apos; 75 per kw.-year. With by-product ammonia at its full pre-war market price and allow-ances as stated above, the estimated production cost would amount to  26 per metric ton, as contrasted with a pre-war market price of about  35.
Sodium Nitrate and Nitrate of Lime.    ^235. Tho manufacture of sodium nitrate and nitrate of lime by the ammonia oxidation process shows to less advantage, the capital outlay for a lime nitrate factory being substantially higher than that for an ammonium nitrate factory. Moreover, the estimated production costs, at tlie factory, provide little margin as compared with the pre-war market price of Chile nitrate, as is indicated in the tables of costs given later (Tables 35 and 36). If supplied with the cheapest synthetic ammonia, however, there is the possibility that the process could produce synthetic sodium nitrate at a cost capable of competing with that of Chile nitrate on a pre-war basis.Application in Sulphuric Acid Manufacture.236. Reference must be made to the utility of comparatively simple and inexpensive ammonia oxidation apparatus for supplying the oxides of nitrogen required in the manufac-ture of sulphuric acid by the leaden chamber process in substitution for the nitre pots hitherto employed. The research work carried out under the direction of the Committee has led to the designing of simple unit lay-outs of different capacities, and these have already been installed and utilised with good results by some of the leading sulphuric acid makers in this country.COMPARATIVE COSTS BY ESTABLISHED PROCESSES.237. The financial aspects of, the established processes, both synthetic and non-synthetic, from the point of view of the manufacture of definite products are summarised in Tables 35 and 36, which enable a direct comparison to be made between the by-product ammonia, the Chile nitrate, and the nitrogen fixation industries. The relative positions of the processes as regards the principal nitrogen compounds are briefly indicated in the paragraphs below, and will be readily understood after reference to the tables of costs which also include figures for the pre-war market prices of Chile nitrate, by-product ammonia, and ammonium sulphate.Concentrated (90 to 96 per cent.) Nitric Acid.238. The synthetic processes, namely, the arc process and the oxidation of synthetic ammonia, yield a very much cheaper product than the standard retort process, and a heavy fall in the price of Chile nitrate would still leave the former processes at an advantage. The product obtained by the oxidation of by-product ammonia shows less margin, and a reduction in the price of the by-product to the lowest figure hitherto recorded would fail to place it on a parity with the cheapest synthetic ammonia for the production of concentrated nitric acid. On the other hand, the capital outlay for an ammonia oxidation factory comprising plant for concentrating and purifying by-product ammonia is substantially lower than that required for any synthetic nitric acid process.239. With cheap power, the arc process can easily compete with any of the others, but is handicapped by the heavy capital outlay required. A moderate improvement in the yield for the energy consumed, coupled with a reduction in the present cost of generating electricity in coal-fired stations, would place the process in a strong position even for a country like Great Britain.Ammonia and Ammonium Sulphate. .240. The Haber process is the most promising of the synthetic methods of manufacturing ammonia and ammonium sulphate and is likely to have a great future. Further experience will, doubless lead to the overcoming of certain difficulties attending its operation, and also to the production of pure hydrogen at a lower cost than hitherto, thus improving the economy of the process. With the cheapest electrical energy, however, the cyanamide process in its latest development appears to be a close competitor of the Haber process, and the two synthetic methods have the advantage of yielding directly a strong and pure ammonia that is well suited for oxidation to nitric acid or for other purposes. On the other hand, the preparation of a pure ammonia gas from crude gas liquor for oxidation into nitric acid entails a cost of about  7 per metric ton of NH3 (reckoned as 100 per cent.) apart from losses during the operation, thus adding substantially to the cost of nitric acid manufactured from the by-product.241. It should be noted that the cost of fixing synthetic ammonia on a large scale with cheap sulphuric acid represents a substantial addition to the original cost of the ammonia nitrogen, namely, about  8&apos;6 per metric ton of combined nitrogen or about  1&apos;75 per metric ton of ammonium sulphate produced. In the case of by-product ammonia the cost is greater, amounting under the most favourable conditions to from  2&quot; 5 to  3 per metric ton of sulphate, according to the system of recovery adopted,       j242. The by-product ammonia industries are in a position to face the competition of synthetic ammonium sulphate by raising the price of products such as coal gas, coke, benzol and tar, to compensate for a fall in that of sulphate, but it is clear that the price of by-product sulphate might have to be reduced to the lowest figure hitherto recorded if the industries were faced with the marketing of the synthetic product on a large scale. . .  *
243. Various methods have been proposed for reducing the cost of fixing ammonia, and a summary of the more important is given in a later section of the Report (page 124).Ammonium Nitrate.244. In the manufacture of ammonium nitrate, processes involving the use of cheap ammonia and of cheap nitric acid made therefrom by the ammonia oxidation process show to a marked advantage as compared with methods depending upon the employment of Chile nitrate or by-product ammonia charged at their pre-war market prices. On the other hand, the capital outlay in the case of the purely synthetic processes is substantially higher than that incurred when non-synthetic raw materials alone are utilised.Nitrate of Lime and Sodium Nitrate.245. The cost of converting dilute nitric acid into a solid nitrate salt packed for the market represents a substantial addition to the cost of the original nitric nitrogen, amounting, according to the process involved, to as much as  16 to  18 per metric ton of fixed nitrogen in the case of nitrate of lime, and to  17 to  20 in the case of sodium nitrate (Avith soda ash at  3 per metric ton).246. The arc process with cheap water power shows to the best advantage, but the other . methods of manufacture leave little margin between the factory costs of the products and the pre-war market price of Chile nitrate. There might, however, be a possibility of competition between the synthetic and the natural nitrate in the case of a combination of the Haber and ammonia oxidation processes, and the position would be-more favourable if soda ash were obtainable at, say, half the price taken above.FUEL REQUIREMENTS OF NITROGEN FIXATION PROCESSES.247. From the point of view of British conditions, it is of some importance to consider the approximate quantities of fuel required for the fixation of a metric ton of combined nitrogen by the arc, Haber, and cyanamide processes. The consumption of fuel may be conveniently allocated under two headings, namely, for power&quot; requirements and for &quot; process &quot; operations.248. On account of the wide variation in the power requirements of the three processes, it is necessary, in order to enable a fair comparison to be made, to assume that each is operated upon a sufficient scale to ensure reasonable economy. An annual output of from 12,000 to 15,000 metric tons of fixed nitrogen has been taken as a reasonable scale of operation, necessitating power stations of about 100,000 kw., 30,000 kw., and 5,000 to 6,000 kw. maximum demand respectively, for the arc, calcium cyanamide, and Haber processes. For such stations it has been assumed that steam turbo-electric generator units of 25,000 kw., 7,500 kw., and 1,000 to 1,250 kw. capacity respectively, would be employed. The coal requirements for power production are derived from the figures given on page 25 of this Report and in Appendices (Appendix IV., Section IV., and Appendix V., Sections III., IV., V. and XV.).249. With regard to process requirements, the waste heat from arc furnace gases is more than sufficient for all the chemical operations, such as evaporating and concentrating. In the case of the calcium cyanamide process, anthracite and coal for burning limestone are needed as raw materials for the carbide stage, but no account has been taken of the small consumption of electrodes in the carbide and calcium cyanamide furnaces respectively. The principal item to be considered in the case of the Haber process is the quantity of coke required for the manufacture of hydrogen by a water-gas process, and the figures given later apply to the water-gas catalytic process. The data for process requirements are derived from the figures given in an Appendix (Appendix V., Sections III., IV., V. and XV.).250. Table 37 (p. 57) shows the total fuel requirements of the- three processes per metric ton of nitrogen fixed when the power is obtained by means of coal-fired steam turbo-electric plant. The effect upon the fuel consumption when the coal is first treated for by-product recovery and the resulting power gas utilised in gas-fired steam turbo-electric stations or in gas-engine electric stations is indicated in detail in an Appendix (Appendix V., - Section XV.).251. The most interesting points revealed by Table 37 are as follows : (a) The relative order of the three processes from the point of view of poAver requirements alone, remains unaltered even Avhen account is taken of the fuel require-ments for &quot;process&quot; operations, although the ratios are substantially smaller in the latter case.(b) The quantities of combined nitrogen obtained by the Haber, calcium cyanamide and arc processes are in the approximate ratios of 7 : 3 : 1 per unit weight of total fuel consumed.(c) An increase or diminution in the price of fuel to the extent of Is. per ton affects the production costs per metric ton of combined nitrogen by as much as  2&apos; 63 in the case of the arc process, by  0&apos;84 in the case of the calcium cyanamide process,, r      and by  0&apos; 36 in the case of the Haber process.

From the point of view of fuel consumption it is evident that the Haber process is the most economical,BY-PRODUCTS FROM NITROGEN FIXATION PROCESSES.252. In the operation of liquid air nitrogen plants to provide the large quantities of nitrogen gas needed for the manufacture of calcium cyanamide or synthetic ammonia, oxygen and the rare gases present in the atmosphere are or can be obtained as by-products. More-over, the manufacture of hydrogen for the Haber process by means of the water-gas catalytic method is accompanied by the formation and separation of considerable quantities of carbon dioxide as a waste product. The extent of the industrial demand for these gaseous products and the present position as regards supplies are considered below.Oxygen.253. According to the standard practice in the liquid air industry, the separation of pure oxygen and of pure nitrogen respectively is effected by plants of different design. The Committee has been informed on good authority that in the case of the standard plants it has not yet been found possible to produce both gases in a state of purity from the same apparatus ; in order to obtain one gas pure, the quality of the other has to he sacrificed. A plant designed for producing nitrogen of 99 to 99 &quot;5 per cent, purity is stated to yield residual oxygen of 55 to 60 per cent, purity only, and in order to raise the whole of this residual oxygen to a state of commercial purity it is necessary to supplement the nitrogen plant with considerable additional power and means of further rectification. It is also stated that it has not hitherto been found worth, while in practice to collect the residual oxygen from nitrogen plants, as it costs very little more to abstract a corresponding amount of oxygen from the atmosphere with an entirely separate apparatus. In this connection, however, it appears from information at the disposal of the Committee that the recovery and utilisation of by-product oxygen from nitrogen plants has been checked by restrictive clauses in trade agreements.254. Recent developments point to the fact that by adopting a modified system of working and a longer rectifying column than is normally employed, it is commercially practicable to separate pure nitrogen and &quot; technically pure &quot; oxygen of about 98&apos; 5 per cent, qualityTabus 37.-FUEL REQUIREMENTS OF SYNTHETIC PROCESSES,
simultaneously by-means of a single liquid air plant, and with less power than is required for a standard oxygen plant of equal capacity.255, Considerable quantities of oxygen could be obtained in the large-scale operation of the Haber and calcium cyanamide processes, and the simultaneous separation of the gases would result in the production of approximately 200 cubic metres (7,000 cubic feet) of technically pure oxygen for every metric ton of nitrogen obtained from the plant.250. Oxygen commanded a high price and a ready market prior to the war,.being used in large quantities for oxy-acetylene welding and metal-cutting and other important purposes. As far as can be ascertained, the consumption in this country in 1911 appears to have amounted to about 3,000,000 cubic metres (106,000,000 cubic feet). There has been an enormous increase in the demand during the war period both in the engineering industry and also for medical and other purposes, and the requirements have exceeded the capacity of the existing producing and bottling plants. As many of the war developments undoubtedly represent permanent extensions of the industries in this country, a market for a large, additional output of oxygen at a reasonable price would appear to be assured.   .257. The oxygen and liquid air industries in this country &quot;cannot be said to have enjoyed a free and unrestricted development on a competitive basis, and the prices hitherto prevailing for the compressed and liquid products have not been conducive to their employment to the fullest extent in the important directions mentioned, and have served to debar their use in other industries in which cheap and perhaps low-grade oxygen might have been utilised with advantage.258. Prior to the war, the selling price of oxygen to fairly large users, inclusive of the cost of compression into cylinders, of the hire of the latter and of freight, was of the order of Id. per cubic foot, or, say,  4 per 1,000 cubic feet. The Committee is not in possession of full data as to the costs involved in the industry, but it must be noted that the actual separation of oxygen from the atmosphere by modern liquefaction plant is not a costly process. The figures available indicate that the running costs of a plant yielding about 24,000 cubic feet of oxygen (of 98 per cent, purity j per hour are of the order of 10c?. to Is. per 1,000 cubic feet, according to the price of electrical energy.259. A reduction in the price of oxygen due to the marketing of the large supplies that could&apos;be obtained as a by-product at a nitrogen fixation installation would undoubtedly be to the advantage of many industries in this country. Even when allowance is made for a reduced price and for the costs incurred in bottling and marketing the by-product, the revenue from its sale would constitute a useful asset towards the operating expenses of the nitrogen fixation factory. The Committee has made no allowance for the potential value of the oxygen in arriving at the estimated costs of operating the Haber and cyanamide processes under British conditions.Argon.260. The modern improvements in the efficiency and life of &quot;gas-filled&quot; incandescent electric lamps have been rendered possible by the employment of inert gases in the biilbs. Although nitrogen is largely used, it is not entirely satisfactory, and the superiority of argon for the purpose has resulted in the creation of a large demand for this gas.261. Argon is present in the atmosphere to the extent of about 0&apos;9 per cent, by volume, and its separation from a large excess of nitrogen and oxygen by chemical methods alone is a difficult and costly operation. In the fractionation of liquid air for the separation of nitrogen, nearly all the argon remains in the liquid oxygen fraction, which may contain from -95 to 98 per cent, of oxygen, from .1&apos;5 to 2 per cent, of argon, and a small percentage of nitrogen, according to the method of fractionation adopted. The separation of the argon from the excess of oxygen and a small amount of nitrogen is a chemical operation of a simpler character than that referred to above, and provides a comparatively cheap method of manufacture.i262. Attempts, have been made by lampmakers in this country to induce the liquid air industry to take up the commercial manufacture of argon, but so far without success. At least one firm of lampmakers has endeavoured to separate argon from the atmosphere on a small scale, but hitherto reliance has been placed upon supplies obtained from abroad. It may also be noted that there is a large importation of argon-filled lamps. Having regard to the present scale of the lamp industry, and to the fact that a large works may require several hundred litres of argon per week, it will be seen that an important industrial demand might be met and satisfied in the working of a fixation plant involving the separation of atmospheric nitrogen.Neon and Helium.263. Neon finds an application as a filling for electric lamp tubes of the luminous glow type, and for tubes used as detectors In wireless telegraphy. The demand for these purposes, however, is quite small.264. Neon and helium are present in the atmosphere to the extent of 0&apos;002 per cent, and 0&apos;00I per cent, by volume respectively, but remain uncondensed during the liquefaction of
air, escaping from the plant in admixture with large quantities of nitrogen and some oxygen. If these gases are passed through a second liquefier, nitrogen and oxygen are condensed, and the gases from this plant may contain as much as 40 to 50 per cent, of neon and helium, the remaining portion consisting of nitrogen.265. In the event of an adequate demand arising, the separation of these gases could thus be made a subsidiary feature of a nitrogen fixation process.Carbon Dioxide.266. The water-gas catalytic process for the manufacture of hydrogen depends upon the fact that carbon monoxide in the presence of steam and a suitable catalyst is converted into carbon dioxide with the liberation of an equal volume of hydrogen from, the steam. In practice, water gas containing approximately 50 per cent, of hydrogen and 40 per cent, of carbon monoxide is used in the process, and the cooled gases from the catalyst plant, after the removal of the steam, contain about 65 per cent, of hydrogen and 30 per cent, of carbon dioxide. The latter is removed in any convenient manner, for example, by absorption in water under pressure, and large quantities would be obtained as a by-product in the operation of a synthetic ammonia factory. Having regard to the uses already made of this gas in various industries, it is possible that a market might be found for the output. It is worthy of note that the use of the by-product in connection with a method of fixing ammonia without the use of sulphuric acid appears to have been in contemplation in Germany before the war. Further reference is made to this method later in the Report in dealing with other proposals for cheapening the cost of fixing ammonia (see page 124).OBSERVATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS.267. The evidence dealing with the economics of the established synthetic and non-synthetic processes may be summarised in the following salient points and conclusions: (a) A metric ton of nitrogen gas can be separated from the air by modern lique-faction processes for less than  1.(6) The market price of a metric ton of combined nitrogen in the United Kingdom prior&apos;to the war varied frcm  66 to  67 (in the forms of ammonium sulphate and Chile nitrate respectively).(c) The synthetic processes can produce a metric ton of combined nitrogen at a cost, at the factory, of from  20 to  30.(d) The lowest recorded market price in the United Kingdom for a metric ton of combined nitrogen (as ammonium sulphate) was  35&apos;8 in 1897.(e) The synthetic processes can produce a metric ton of concentrated (93 to 96 per cent.) nitric acid for about half the cost by the Chile nitrate retort process.(/) The synthetic processes can produce a metric ton of combined nitrogen ready for the fertiliser market, as cyanamide (nitrolim) or ammonium sulphate, at a cost, at the factory, of about or even less than one-half the pre-war market price of combined nitrogen in the United Kingdom.(g) The synthetic processes, with the exception of the arc process under favourable conditions as regards cheap water power, are not in a position to produce nitrate fertilisers at a sufficiently low cost to face the possible competition of Chile nitrate; This position may, however, be altered by the development of more economical methods of recovering oxides of nitrogen in the form of nitrate salts.(h) The capital expenditure for installing the synthetic processes is not excessive, being somewhat less than, or on a parity with, the pre-war market value of the annual production, except in the case of the arc process, for which the outlay is nearly twice the market value of the annual production. i(i) The facility with which oxygen and the rare gases of the atmosphere can be obtained as by-products in the manufacture of cyanamide and synthetic ammonia is an asset in favour of these processes for British conditions on account of the fact that several important industries would derive a substantial advantage from the marketing of additional supplies of these gases at reasonable prices. The relative merits of the processes themselves, however, would probably not be affected by the prices obtainable for the by-products.
VI.-PARTLY DEVELOPED PROCESSES AND RECENT INVENTIONS.268. The three synthetic processes already dealt with represent the present extent of commercial success, hut numerous other methods of fixing atmospheric nitrogen have been proposed and experimented with. Some of the most attractive methods have been tried on a substantial scale, and even upon a full commercial scale, and in view of the undoubted possibilities attaching to the number of the partly developed processes, the Committee has given them considerable attention. The chief characteristics and prospects of the more important methods are reviewed below, and the evidence dealing with the technical details and practical operation of the processes is given in an Appendix (Appendix V&apos;.).THE HAUSSER (OR EXPLOSION) PROCESS.269. Atmospheric nitrogen and oxygen combine to a limited extent when the gases are heated to a sufficiently high temperature, and the Hausser process relies upon the explosion of a combustible gas and air, with or without enriching oxygen, in a closed vessel for bringing about the combination. The exhaust gases from the explosion apparatus contain a small per-centage of oxides of nitrogen, which can be recovered in the form of dilute nitric acid by absorption in water (Appendix V., Section IX.).270. This method of fixing nitrogen represents an attempt to make direct use of thermal energy instead of the electric arc, and thus to avoid the large amount of power required by the use of the arc. It is subject, however, to a number of limitations, as indicated in detail in the Appendix, being governed not only by the explosion temperature, but also by the composition of the burnt products and by the extent to which the nitric oxide in the hot gases dissociates during the exhaust stage. Experimental results indicate that the process as hitherto operated yields exhaust gases containing some 0&apos; 3 to 0&apos; 6 per cent, by volume of nitric oxide, as corn-pared with about 1&apos; 25 per cent, in the case of the Norwegian arc furnaces. For reasons, previously given, it is apparent that the Hausser process involves the use of very large absorption plant for the efficient recovery of the fixed nitrogen from such dilute gases.271. Moreover, it appears necessary to use a combustible gas of high calorific value, such as coke-oven gas, and the latter is, in fact, the only gas available in this country at a sufficiently low cost to render its employment in the process economical. It has been claimed that natural gas and oil fuels are possible alternatives, but no evidence is available to show that these have been actually experimented with.272. The apparatus hitherto employed in carrying out the process has been of a com-paratively simple character, comprising stationary explosion bombs with mechanically-operated valve gear. Various difficulties, however, were encountered with this type of apparatus, and at the outbreak of war the problem of devising a bomb capable of operating continuously under the severe conditions imposed does not appear to have been completely solved.273. A trial factory was erected in 1913 at Heeringen, in Westphalia, the installation comprising stationary bombs having a capacity of 100 litres (3&apos; 53 cubic feet). Upon the basis of the results obtained at this factory and at an earlier experimental plant at Nuremberg, the Hausser process was guaranteed to give a minimum yield of 135 gm. of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) per cubic metre of coke-oven gas having a calorific value of 4,300 kg. calories per cubic metre (483 B.Th.U. per cubic foot) when operating at an initial compression of 5&apos;5 to 6 atmospheres and with a pre-heat of about 240o C.274. As the outcome of independent trials carried out at Heeringen early in 1914, detailed estimates were prepared for a larger installation having an output of the order of 5,000 metric tons of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.; per annum. For the &quot; guaranteed &quot; minimum yield, the estimated capital outlay, inclusive of stationary bombs, compressors, absorption and acid-concentrating plant, gas-engine power plant, and buildings and land, amounted to about  18 per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) per annum, as compared with about  39 for an arc furnace and steam-power installation under British conditions. The corresponding production costs of concentrated nitric acid (calculated as 100 per cent.) with coke-oven gas charged at 3&apos;26d. per 1.000 cubic feet, inclusive of all working expenses, repairs, general charges, and amortisation at 10 per cent, on the capital outlay, were estimated to amount to about  12 per metric ton, as compared with  11&apos; 5 in the case of the arc process under British conditions with electrical energy at  3&quot; 75 per kw.-year.275. With regard to the availability of coke-oven gas for a Hausser installation in this countiy, it may be noted that a battery of 50 modern by-product ovens carbonising 2,750 tons of coal per week, would yield sufficient surplus gas above that needed for the coking and recovery operations to produce about 2,200 metric tons of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) per year of 5Q weeks. Moreover, the by-product ammonia obtained from the coal would be sufficient for converting about 60 per cent, of the total output of acid into ammonium nitrate. In many places the whole of the surplus gas is already utilised for colliery or other purposes, and if it were diverted to a Hausser plant, the industries concerned would have to substitute coal. The cost of the gas to the nitric acid factory would then have to be based upon the value of the coal needed to replace it, and in view of the situation of
the industries in relation to the pit&apos;s mouth, the gas should be obtainable, on a calorific basis, for about 2d. or 2&apos;5d. per 1,000 cubic feet. The cost quoted above, namely, 3&apos;26d per 1,000 cubic feet, is on the high side for British conditions, being equivalent, on a calorific basis, to about 15s. per ton for coal. The &quot; guaranteed &quot; minimum yield corresponds to the utilisation of about 261,000 cubic feet of coke-oven gas per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) recovered, so that an increase or reduction in the cost of the gas by Id. per 1,000 cubic feet would affect the production costs of nitric acid to the extent of over  1 per metric ton.276. Attention must be drawn to the fact that by employing stationary bombs, no attempt is made to use the potential power of the explosion, while the plant has actually to be supplied with power from external sources for compressing the explosive mixture into the bombs, for operating the valve-gear, and the like. The nett power requirements of such a plant, after allowing for the steam-raising value of the exhaust gases, appear to amount to about 1 kw.-year per metric ton of fixed nitrogen recovered in the form of dilute nitric acid.277. It was originally proposed to carry out the process with a gas-engine, and to utilise the energy of the explosion for performing external work. Although this idea was apparently not developed on a practical scale at the Nuremberg or Heeringen plants, there is evidence to show that other investigators in Germany had carried out large-scale trials in this direction before the war, and with some measure of success.278. The process, when considered as a method of power production giving nitric acid as a by-product, presents considerable attractions. An important memorandum, prepared by an officer of the Munitions Inventions Department and dealing with the whole theory of the process on this basis, has been under consideration by the Committee; it indicates that distinct possibilities attach to the employment of a simple design of explosion motor with a free piston in conjunction with a compressed air engine or turbine. Such a motor would avoid the troubles due to the presence of dead-centre gearing in ordinary types of gas-engines, would accurately measure the gaseous mixture for each explosion and compress the mixture, and would allow of pre-ignition, thus resulting in higher temperatures and a high-peak diagram. It is probable that the combination of such a motor with a compressed-air engine or turbine, if used for a Hausser installation consuming 4,000 cubic metres (141,240 cubic feet) of coke oven gas of average calorific value per hour, would enable some 3,000 kw. to be generated continuously. The Munitions Inventions Department has been in consultation with a well-known firm of turbine makers on this question, and the firm is prepared to guarantee an output of the order of 3,000 kw. under specific conditions as regards the volume, compression, and temperature of the gases obtained in the operation of the explosion motor.279. The development of the Hausser process on these lines offers the prospect of a very cheap method of obtaining nitric acid, since the revenue obtained from the sale of the electrical energy would probably reduce the cost below that of any other synthetic nitric acid process. On the other hand, the large absorption plant required for recovering oxides of nitrogen by existing methods may militate against the extensive commercial adoption of the process.CYANIDE PROCESSES.280. When a mixture of carbon and an alkali or alkaline earth is heated to a temperature of l,000o to l,200o C. and treated with a gas containing free nitrogen, the latter is absorbed with the formation of a crude cyanide or a mixture of cyanide and cyanamide, according to the nature of the metallic base. The crude product can be treated for the manufacture of a finished cyanide, or its combined nitrogen can be liberated in the form of ammonia by the action of steam.   (Appendix V., Section X.).281. Numerous attempts, dating from the middle of the nineteenth century, have been made in the United Kingdom and elsewhere to operate these processes on a large scale for the manufacture of ferrocyanides, cyanides, and ammonia, but hitherto without commercial success. A review of the more important attempts is given in the Appendix, together with an indication of the causes that have contributed to their failure.282. The cyanide processes present two distinct economic aspects according to whether they are operated for the manufacture of finished cyanides, for which there is a limited market, or for ammonia, for which the demand is very large. The pre-war market price of combined nitrogen in the form of sodium cyanide (28 per cent. N.) amounted to  230 per metric ton, as compared with about  66 per metric ton for ammonia nitrogen in the form of sulphate. It is obvious, therefore, that commercial success in cyanide-making might be quite consistent with failure as.regards the manufacture of ammonia.283. On account of the comparatively moderate reaction temperatures involved in fixing atmospheric nitrogen in the form of cyanides, there has always appeared a possibility of carrying out. the processes by the direct use of fuel and of avoiding the employment of relatively costly electrical energy. It was observed at an early date that the presence of metallic iron in the reaction mixture facilitated the absorption of nitrogen at a reduced temperature, but the results of more recent researches upon this aspect of the process suggest that the requisite temperature in the case of mixtures of sodium carbonate, carbon and iron, is still as high as 900o to 950o C.u  6619    &apos; E
284. In considering the possibilities of external heating, it is important to note that temperatures of the orders in question are above the limit at which iron or steel retorts will stand up in continuous operation. If retorts of ordinary refractory materials are employed, the fuel requirements for external heating are considerably increased, and further jdifficulties are encountered owing to the well-known fluxing properties of alkalies and alkaline earths and to the corrosive action of the reaction mass when in a plastic or fused condition. From a careful consideration of the history of past failures, it appears doubtful whether success can be achieved if reliance is placed upon external, heating.285. The application of internal electrical heating is the most obvious alternative, and a serious effort was made in this country to operate the process commercially on these lines, the furnace charge being utilised as a heating resistance. The process was worked for several years before being abandoned, and the evidence available to the Committee points to the conclusion that it came nearer to achieving success than any of the other large-scale attempts that have been made. There is a possibility that the process might be brought into a position to compete with other synthetic processes on nearly equal terms if the problem of internal heating were taken up again in the light of recent experience in electro-chemical operations, and with the assistance of engineering skill such as has been devoted to other fixation processes.286. The cyanide processes involve the handling and treatment of large quantities of solid materials, and yield crude primary products which require further treatment in order to obtain a marketable form of combined nitrogen. In order to reduce the amount of handling required, efforts have been made to render the process a continuous one for the manufacture of ammonia, but the problem of replenishing the carbon in the reaction mixture, which is depleted during the cyanide stage, is not a straightforward one. Should it prove possible to treat, decompose, and regenerate the furnace mixture in situ, the cyanide processes might have a successful future as a method of manufacturing synthetic ammonia. If, however, the processes have to be operated upon the batch or discontinuous system, involving the removal of the crude products from the retorts or furnaces for obtaining a marketable product, they might attain success as a method of making cyanides, although proving uneconomical as ammonia processes.THE SERPEK (OR ALUMINIUM NITRIDE) PROCESS.287. This process depends upon the fact that a mixture of alumina or bauxite and carbon, when heated to temperatures of the order of l,500o to l,800o C, absorbs nitrogen gas with the formation of aluminium nitride. The furnace product is decomposed by treatment with steam or dilute alkali under proper conditions, the fixed nitrogen being liberated in the form of ammonia, and the aluminium passing into the form of oxide or hydroxide (Appendix V., Section XL). Having regard, however, to the inconsistent character of the evidence, it appears doubtful whether the reactions involved in the decomposition of the nitride have been definitely established.288. The chief attraction of the process is the prospect of combining the manufacture of pure alumina for the aluminium industry with the production of synthetic ammonia as a by-product. The efforts already made in this direction indicate that when bauxite is used as a raw material for the process, it is possible to convert practically its entire content of alu-minium into nitride, and thus to recover it as pure alumina. Prior to the war, the world&apos;s annual production of aluminium amounted to some 70,000 tons, but this figure has been very largely increased during the war period, and it is probably&quot; safe to assume that the present production is of the order of 200,000 tons per annum. If the whole of the alumina required for the manufacture of this output were ultimately obtained by means of the Serpek process, about 500,000 tons of ammonium sulphate would be obtained as a by-product, equivalent to one-third of the world&apos;s visible supply of sulphate in 1914.289. From the point of view of nitrogen fixation alone, the process offers the possibility of obtaining synthetic ammonia by a simple cycle of operations involving the use of a limited quantity of raw material. It has yet to be established, however, that the regenerated alumina is as equally well adapted as the original bauxite for conversion into nitride, and that the cost of regeneration is sufficiently economical to render it preferable to use the alumina in the cycle rather than for the manufacture of aluminium.290. Unless further investigations upon the conditions of operation and&apos; the effect of catalysts lead to the discovery of a method of bringing about the formation of the nitride at lower temperatures than those previously mentioned, reliance upon electrical heating for &apos; effecting the reaction would appear to be essential. It is claimed, however, that the total power requirements of the process are only from 10 to 12 kw.-hours per kg. of nitrogen fixed, or less than the requirements of the calcium cyanamide process.291. The crux of the Serpek process undoubtedly resides in the problem of devising a suitable form of furnace that is capable of continuous and economical operation and of with-standing the elevated temperatures hitherto found necessary. Some measure of success appears to have been attained in the semi-commercial operations carried out prior to the war,
and it is probable that further endeavours will be made to solve the problem after the war on account of the stimulus supplied by the great expansion of the aluminium industry and the consequent demand for pure alumina.COMBUSTION PROCESSES.292. The combustion processes have a close analogy with the Hausser process, the aim in each case being to effect the oxidation of atmospheric nitrogen by direct thermal action. The methods, of which those proposed by Bender are the best known, involve the combustion of fuel gases, such as coal gas, water gas, or natural methane gas, under conditions whereby the temperature is notably augmented, the products of combustion heing rapidly cooled in order to conserve, as far as possible, the small percentage of nitric oxide that is formed. The latter can be recovered in the form of dilute nitric acid, as in the case of the arc process (Appendix V., Section XII.).293. According to one method of operation, the fuel gas is burnt under pressure at the upper ends of a set of long tubular burners of the Bunsen type arranged in a furnace, the temperature of the flames being augmented by an ascending current of heated air which is circulated around the outside of the tubes.294. The limitations&apos; pointed out in dealing with the Hausser process also apply to combustion processes, and a further factor to be considered is the availability of materials capable of withstanding the severe conditions imposed by continuous working at augmented temperatures. Although the materials themselves would not attain the maximum flame temperatures, the degree to which the gases would require to be heated in order to secure commercial yields of nitric oxide would probably necessitate the employment of the most refractory of known materials for lining the apparatus. Apart from this difficulty, it might be possible to obtain temperatures comparable with those of the Hausser process or even of the electric arc, by employing fuel gases of high calorific value in conjunction with recuperative heating or with pre-heated air or oxygen, as has been proposed. On the other hand, the expedients hitherto proposed for rapidly cooling the products of combustion are unlikely to be as effective as the sudden expansion characteristic of the Hausser process. From a consideration of the various chemical and physical limitations, it is doubtful whether combustion processes could in practice be rendered superior to the arc process or even the Hausser process as regards the percentage of fixed nitrogen ultimately recoverable from the gaseous products.295. The Bender process appears to have owed its application on a practical scale to the chance discovery in 1909 of a jet of natural methane in Hungary. A provisional concession to utilise a portion of the gas was granted to a company formed for exploiting the process, and was subsequently made definite after it had been demonstrated at a small trial plant that the process was workable. A factory was in course of erection in 1913 for utilising about 200,000 cubic metres of gas per day, but no information is available as to whether the enterprise was a commercial success.296. Combustion processes present some attractions, owing to the comparative simplicity and inexpensive character of the plant required, and if successfully developed would have an important bearing upon nitrogen fixation in countries possessing abundant supplies of coal. They might also find application as a method of manufacturing nitric &quot;acid and nitrates in parts of the British Empire where supplies of natural gas are available, as in Canada.NEW INVENTIONS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS.&apos;297. During the course of the Committee&apos;s investigations, numerous proposals and inventions dealing with nitrogen fixation have been submitted to or brought to the notice of the Munitions Inventions Department. These have ranged over a wide field, but in the main have related principally to improvements in (a) the construction and operation of arc furnaces, (b) the ammonia oxidation process, (c) the recovery of oxides of nitrogen from gases such as are obtained by the arc process and ammonia oxidation process, (d) the synthesis of ammonia by direct or indirect methods, (e) the manufacture of hydrogen, and (/) the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen by the silent electric discharge.298. These proposals and inventions, were carefully examined by the Sub-Committees concerned, both in the light of the work of other investigators in the same fields, and also of the results obtained during the course of the researches carried out under the direction of the Committee. In the majority of cases the proposals were found to traverse ground that had already been well explored and to present no special features of merit. In other cases, the adoption of specific processes and plants was advocated, but upon examination these Avere found to be insufficiently developed from the commercial point of view to justify a recom-mendation being made either for their adoption or even for a large-scale trial under war conditions.299. The more important recent developments or modifications proposed in connection with the arc process, such as in the construction of the furnaces, the method of operation and
tJ4 NITROGEN PRODUCTS COMMITTEE :   FINAL REPORT.the recovery of oxides of nitrogen, are referred to in an Appendix (Appendix V., Section III). Most of these can hardly be said yet to have emerged from the small experimental scale, but one of them, namely, a process for the direct production of solid nitrate of lime, appears to have had a thorough trial and to offer distinct prospects of avoiding existing types of recovery plant, and of obtaining a marketable form of combined nitrogen without the intermediate production of a liquid product. Reference has already been made to this dry absorption method when dealing with the arc process, to which it has hitherto been applied, although it is claimed to he of general application to any gases containing oxides of nitrogen. It may be noted that the research work carried out under the direction of the Committee points to the conclusion that the absorption is probably attended with losses of combined nitrogen.300. With regard to the action of the silent electric discharge upon nitrogen, a brief reference may be made to the research work carried out in this-country, which has led to the discovery by Professor the Hon. R. J. Strutt of a form of &quot; active &quot; nitrogen, and also to the identification by Dr. T. M. Dowry of another modification. These discoveries have not yet found direct practical application in connection with the problem of nitrogen fixation, but have contributed important information to the complex question of the mechanism of the interaction of nitrogen with other elements under the influence of the electric discharge.OBSERVATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS.301. Two of the partly developed processes reviewed above represent attempts to manu-facture nitric acid from the air by the aid of fuel instead of electricity, and the other two are ammonia-producing processes. The primary products of the former consist of oxides of nitrogen in such a dilute form that a very large plant is essential for their efficient recovery as long as the present system of water absorption has to be relied upon. The primary products yielded by the latter are solid, but it is necessary to submit them to further treatment in order to obtain a marketable form of combined nitrogen.302. In all these methods of fixing nitrogen, difficulties have been encountered owing to the elevated temperatures required, but there is no reason to anticipate that they will not eventually be overcome. The cyanide processes are further handicapped by the properties and characteristics of the raw materials and crude products, but the Committee has been informed on good authority that most of the consequent difficulties have already been surmounted in the course of recent investigations carried out in this country.303. After a careful consideration of the relative merits and possibilities of the above processes from the standpoint of British conditions, the Committee has come to the conclusion that the modified Hausser process, whereby power and nitric acid can be obtained simultaneously, and the cyanide processes for the production of synthetic ammonia are the most promising of the partly-developed methods of fixing nitrogen, and are well worthy of a trial.304. With reference to future developments in nitrogen fixation, it is probable that the prospects will, be more favourable for ammonia-producing processes than for direct nitric acid processes, on account of the relatively small demand for nitric nitrogen under normal conditions, and of the facility with which it can be obtained from ammonia nitrogen by recent methods of catalytic oxidation.VII. RESEARCHES UNDERTAKEN ON NITROGEN PROCESSES.305. The Committee was required by its terms of reference &quot; To carry out the experimental work necessary to arrive at definite conclusions as to the practicability and efficiency of such processes as may appear to the Committee to be of value.&quot;306. In view of the difficulties and delays that are inseparable from experimental work, and of the special difficulties that were certain to be encountered in embarking upon the research in time of war, the Committee formulated a provisional programme at a very early stage in its deliberations. The factors which exercised a strong influence upon the Committee&apos;s decision in this matter were as follows :-(a) Nitrogen fixation processes and &apos; the ammonia oxidation process were not established in the United Kingdom, and, with the exception of the cyanide processes, had not even been tried upon a commercial scale.(b) The arc and calcium cyanamide processes were thoroughly established and in successful commercial operation in Allied and neutral countries, so that full working plans could be obtained by the Government in the event of an emergency.(e) The Haber or synthetic ammonia process was in commercial operation in Germany alone, and little information was available concerning its technical aspects. On the other hand, the-small power requirements of the process, and the fact that coke could be utilised as a principal raw material (for the manufacture of the necessary hydrogen), rendered the synthetic ammonia process well suited for British conditions,
(d) The Ostwald process of oxidising ammonia had been, in operation abroad before the war on a full technical scale, but had not achieved any commercial prominence. Profiting, however, by the modern developments, Germany had demon-demonstrated, as early as 1916, the military importance of ammonia oxidation as a means of producing nitric acid and nitrates. This process also appeared well suited to British conditions on account of the large home production of ammonia.307. With two well-established processes as a stand-by, the Committee decided that the experimental work should be concentrated upon the problems of the synthesis and the oxidation of ammonia, as it was felt that if success attended the investigations, the results might prove of special value to the country during the course of the Avar.ORGANISATION AND STAFF.308. After the main lines of the research programme had been decided upon, -it became apparent that a Committee sitting at intervals was hardly in a position to give the large amount of time and attention required for the organisation and continuous supervision of the work. One of the members, Dr. J. A. Harker, F.R.S., was therefore appointed by the Chairman, then Controller of Munitions Inventions, to the technical staff of the Department, and constituted Director of Research. While acting in close consultation with the Committee, Dr. Iiarker was thus enabled to devote his whole time to such matters as the acquisition, equipment and staffing of the research laboratory, and to the conduct and supervision of the Avork. During the absence of Dr. Harker on special duty in 1917, Mr. W. R. Bousfield. K.C., F.R.S., another member of the Committee, acted as his deputy.309. It was realised at the outset that if reasonable progress Avas to be looked for under the difficult conditions prevailing in war-time, it would be necessary to secure the services of investigators who had already had the right kind of experience. Considerable attention was therefore devoted to obtaining men having the proper qualifications for the different branches of the work. More than one half of the chemists ultimately appointed had already enlisted in the Navy or Army, and as some were employed in technical capacities abroad, it was only after inevitable delays that their services could be obtained. The Committee wishes to acknoAvledge its indebtedness to the War Office and to the Admiralty for sanctioning the transfer of the officers in question. The Department has undoubtedly been fortunate in the personnel of the staff engaged for the experimental work of the Committee, and especially is this true of those who ultimately became responsible for the organisation of the work of the different sections.- The Committee and the Director of Research Avish to place on record their obligation to the whole of the staff, who have worked with great loyalty and whole-hearted, enthusiasm throughout the difficult war period.LABORATORY ACCOMMODATION.310. Laboratory accommodation of ample and somewhat special character was needed for carrying out the experimental work in vieAv, and the task of obtaining and equipping a suitable laboratory Avas undertaken by the Munitions Inventions Department. Through the willing co-operation of the respective Provost, and Principal, and of the professorial staffs, excellent accommodation was ultimately arranged for in London at University College, GoAver Street, and at Kings College, Strand.311. At University College, where by far the larger portion of the work has been carried out, the Department was fortunate in obtaining the use of the new Ramsay laboratories Avhich were just approaching completion in the early part of 1916. In addition to laboratories of the usual type, this building contained a large and lofty technical laboratory of a character not usually found in a University. This room proved of the greatest use and furnished an admirable centre for the semi-technical operations which were eventually carried out. Through the kindness of the professorial staff, the use of a well-fitted Avorkshop belonging conjointly to the Chemistry and Physics Departments of the College, and the services of an unusually competent mechanic Avere also made available to the Munitions Inventions Department. At the outset, the larger scale operations upon both the synthesis and the oxidation of ammonia were housed in the technical laboratory, but the rapid development of the Avork rendered it negessary to secure additional accommodation. Arrangements were therefore made for&apos; the use of the Williamson laboratories, and the ammonia oxidation section was ultimately transferred to this building.3i2. At King&apos;s College, the Department obtained accommodation in the Metallurgical Laboratory, and experiments upon the synthesis of ammonia were carried out there for more than a year.313. In addition to the work undertaken at the above centres, operations on a larger scale were also conducted at three gasAvorks in London and at three other works in the country, where facilities were aA^available for investigations on the preparation and purification of gases.U  6619 &apos; &quot; E 3
THE EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAMME.314. The two main branches of research have involved the investigation of many-correlated and subsidiary problems, and,a general indication of the scope of the experimental work undertaken is therefore given.315. A beginning was made during the summer of 1916 with a systematic study of the chemistry and chemical engineering of the synthetic ammonia process, the chemistry and chemical physics of the process being first investigated on a laboratory scale before proceeding with the correlated problem of the engineering details. Some of the more important matters dealt with in the course of the research were:  &apos;(a) A special study of the efficiency and general behaviour of numerous patented aiid other catalysts with a view to the selection of examples best suited for technical use.(6) The determination of the conditions of temperature, pressure, and gas velocity for optimum yields of ammonia.(c) The effect of specific impurities liable to occur in the catalytic substances and in the gases themselves, and methods for the removal of such impurities,id) The revivification of catalysts, the activity of which had become impaired during use.(e) Methods for the removal of the ammonia produced during the synthesis.(/) An examination of the problems involved in the circulation of gases at, high pressures and velocities, including a study of heat insulation and of thermal exchange between currents of heated gases.316. It was at once realised that the technical success of the synthetic ammonia process depended essentially upon the cost and quality of the hydrogen available, and that to place the process on a sound economic basis, it would be necessary to work out a method of manufacturing hydrogen of a very high degree of purity at a cost decidedly lower than that of any hydrogen produced commercially in this country. The importance of the quality of the hydrogen was soon emphasised by experimental results showing the effects upon the catalysts when varying percentages of the different impurities likely to be present in commercial hydrogen were definitely added to an original mixture of pure gases. A separate branch of the research was therefore constituted to deal with the manufacture and purification of hydrogen.   Two of the principal matters dealt with in this branch were : (a) A detailed study of the water-gas catalytic process for the manufacture of hydrogen [Appendix V., Sections IV. and XV.). Although the process was invented in this country, its commercial development was effected in Germany and, as far as is known to the Committee, the process has not hitherto been used on a technical scale outside that country.(b) The devising of methods for effecting the very complete removal of impurities from the hydrogen manufactured by existing commercial processes.317. With regard to the oxidation of ammonia, a fair amount of information had been published in technical literature, but statements dealing with the technology of the process were conflicting and claims as to the yields obtained from various types of converter were obviously exaggerated. A thorough investigation was therefore instituted so as to cover in as systematic a manner as possible, the following fields of enquiry; (a) The most suitable catalytic materials for the combustion of gaseous ammonia with air or oxygen.(6) The design of converters suitable for technical use, and an investigation of their efficiency, output, and general behaviour under widely differing conditions.(c) The reaction kinetics of the oxidation process as a whole, including the absorption of oxides of nitrogen by water in tower systems and the production of strong nitric acid.(d) The absorption of oxides of nitrogen by solvents other than, water.(e) The preparation of nitrates from oxides of nitrogen by dry and wet absorption processes.(/) The direct preparation of ammonium nitrate from oxides of nitrogen.318. In addition to the three main branches of research outlined above, a physical section was subsequently constituted. The staff of this section investigated, both experimentally and mathematically, a number of physical problems arising out of the main researches. In addition to original work, a large amount of chemical and physical data relating to nitrogen fixation was collected from widely scattered sources and correlated. This material together with some original matter and 47&apos; explanatory graphs was compiled in the form of a booklet and was widely circulated to controlled firms, to Government Departments, Allied Governments and scientific and technical institutions, In view of the extended demand for the publication, arrangements have been made by the Controller of Munitions Inventions for the sale to the general public through H.M. Stationery Office of a revised edition, entitled Physical and Chemical Data of Nitrogen Fixation,
RESULTS ATTAINED.319. The Committee has been faced with a difficult problem in deciding to what extent the detailed results of the research work could be incorporated in the present Report. In the first place, over 200 reports and monographs with many diagrams, charts and plans have already been prepared by members of the research staff, embodying full details of the numerous experiments carried out at the laboratories and at different works throughout the country. If the present programme is carried to completion and&apos; no new research undertaken, it is anticipated that there will be upwards of 250 reports and monographs dealing with actual experimental work. In the next place, some of the conclusions based upon earlier results have had to be modified in the light of later experience, as was only to be expected. Moreover, special weight has to be given to results obtained on a semi-technical or full technical scale, and as experiments of this character are still proceeding, a detailed review put forward at the present moment might obviously prove premature. Finally, it must be noted that some of the more important results form the subject-matter of secret patents taken out on behalf of the Government.320. In the opinion of the Committee, about three-quarters of the matter contained in the experimental reports could, after proper preparation, be made generally available. Upon a moderate estimate, however, at least six months&apos; work would be required for co-ordinating the whole of the material and for putting it into a form suitable for general publication. After a full consideration of the position, and being unanimously desirous of completing the present Report at the earliest possible moment, the Committee has decided that no useful purpose -would be served at the present stage by attempting to give a detailed summary of matter which obviously requires the most careful correlation. The following paragraphs, however, give a brief indication of the results of the work already accomplished in the different branches of the research.Synthetic Ammonia Section.321. The preliminary work of this section was largely devoted to experimental determina-tions of the relative efficiencies of different catalysts, some 200 preparations being investigated under varying conditions of temperature, pressure and gas velocity A limited number of &apos; these catalysts was selected for further study. Up to the time of the experiments, the highest yields quoted in technical literature were equivalent to from 0&apos; 25 kg. to 1 kg. of ammonia per hour per litre of space occupied by catalyst in the apparatus employed (Appendix V., Section IV.). After some general experience had been gained, however, it -was found that with good catalytic substances and a high velocity of circulation, yields equivalent to from 10 to 20 kg. of ammonia per hour per litre of catalyst space could be obtained without difficulty at working pressures ranging from 100 to 150 atmospheres.322. The optimum conditions of working having been clearly established by these small-scale experiments, it was obviously necessary to determine how far the results could be reproduced by a larger apparatus. Designs were therefore prepared for a much larger catalyst unit, and a plant was constructed having a catalyst space about 600 times the size of that in the original laboratory apparatus. The operations of this semi-technical unit served to confirm the soundness of the earlier work, and high yields of the order previously indicated were consistently realised with this plant. A thorough study of the chemical engineering side of the problem was then made with a view to the construction of a full-sized commercial unit, the latter, in the form originally planned, involving a magnification of about 40-fold in the catalyst space as compared with that of the semi-technical unit,323. In the meantime, considerable attention has been devoted to the other items included in the programme previously outlined and to a number of incidental problems of subsidiary importance. In view of the general progress made by the late summer of 1917 in all branches of the work, it was felt that the time had arrived for the erection of the commercial unit recommended in the Interim Report and sanctioned by Dr. Addison, then Minister of Munitions (Appendix I.). The preparation of designs for such a unit was therefore begun and arrangements were initiated in connection with its construction and erection.324. At this stage of the work, the engineers of the Department of Explosives Supply became convinced that, by adopting as a basis the lines indicated by the experimental investi-gations, they would be in a position to proceed at once with the construction of a technical plant for the manufacture of synthetic ammonia and ammonium nitrate on a large scale. A short account is given in an Appendix (Appendix I.) of the subsequent action taken on the initiative of the Explosives Department which led eventually to sanction being given for the erection of a large National Factory for the production of ammonium nitrate by the conjoint use of the synthesis and the oxidation of ammOnia.Hydrogen Section.1 325. The work of this section, although primarily undertaken in connection with the synthetic ammonia process, has an interest apart altogether from nitrogen fixation owing to the enormous scale upon which hydrogen is now manufactured for the hydrogenation of fatse i
and oils and for aeronautics.   For- each of these purposes low cost of manufacture and a high purity are important considerations.   As previously indicated, the water-gas catalytic process for the manufacture of hydrogen was one of the first matters to be investigated, and the efficiencies and properties of various catalytic substances were studied by means of experi-ments conducted on a laboratory scale.  The experience gained in this way led to the building of a larger apparatus capable of producing about 200 cubic feet of hydrogen per hour, and a gas containing less than 0&apos; 05 per .cent. of carbon monoxide was consistently obtained during a long series of trials.   In collaboration with the Admiralty Hydrogen Department, arrange-ments were then initiated for the construction and extended trial of a full-scale commercial unit of plant.   These arrangements, however, were not carried to completion owing to the fact that the services of the research staff were placed at the disposal of the Department of Explosives Supply in connection with the preparation of plans for the hydrogen section of the National Factory referred to above.326. In the meanwhile, the research upon the synthesis of ammonia had pointed to the conclusion that ultimate commercial success on the lines being developed would involve the use of hydrogen containing probably a maximum of 0&apos;05 per cent, of carbon monoxide and less than 1 part of sulphur compounds in a million of gas. The advantages and disadvantages of the various methods for the elimination of these and other impurities from hydrogen manufactured by the water-gas catalytic process and also by existing commercial processes were therefore made the subject of a thorough examination. While it was known that several methods could be successfully employed in the laboratory, the suitability of any process for technical application involves an important consideration, namely, the amount of reagent required for the purification of a given quantity of gas in a given time. Special attention was therefore given throughout these studies to the determination of the &quot; space-velocity &quot; up to which the different processes might be considered satisfactory from the technical standpoint.327. The elimination of small quantities of carbon monoxide was one of the most formidable problems; nevertheless, important advances have to be recorded. For example, a method was worked out for effecting the removal of carbon monoxide at high rates of gas flow, and the small scale experiments were so successful that arrangements were made for a trial on a much larger scale than was possible at the Research Laboratory, semi-technical apparatus being built for the purpose. The operations were carried out at a works where commercial hydrogen containing from 2 to 4 per cent, of carbon monoxide was available, and afterwards at a second works where there was a supply of hydrogen made by the Lane process, and containing on an average about 0&apos;25 per.cent, of carbon monoxide. In both sets of trials, quantities of gas ranging up to 200 cu. ft. per hour were dealt with satisfactorily.328. Another method, which promises to provide the basis of a sound technical process, was devised after a re-examination of the possibilities of fractional combustion, first studied by Henry nearly a century ago. It was shown by numerous experiments on a small scale that complete oxidation of carbon monoxide could be effected catalytically at quite low tempera-tures. A combination process involving fractional combustion was subsequently elaborated, and an apparatus capable of dealing with 200 cu. ft. of gas per hour was tested with industrial hydrogen containing from 2 to 4 per cent, of carbon monoxide. The purified gas obtained during trials of several weeks duration showed consistently less than 0&apos; 05 per cent, of carbon monoxide. Results of a promising character were also obtained during the investigations on several methods for the removal of minute traces of sulphur.329. Several different types of recording apparatus were developed for giving a continuous indication of the varying amount of a gaseous impurity present in a flow of another gas. One of the most successful is a recorder for showing small percentages of carbon monoxide in hydrogen, and a number of instruments have been made, constructed, and operated under commercial conditions.Ammonia Oxidation and Nitrate Section.330. Much useful work has been accomplished in this section of the research organisation upon each of the problems indicated in the programme, and encouraging results have to be recorded. In some directions, however, progress has been retarded by the difficulty of obtaining the delivery of necessary plant.- 331. After a preliminary investigation of the properties and general characteristics of various metallic and non-metallic catalysts, a thorough study was made of the behaviour of converters of different design constructed of aluminium, a platinum catalyst in the form of a wire net being employed. The relative efficiencies of converters having single, double, and multiple nets were carefully determined, and the effects of preheating the gases and of varying the ratio of air to ammonia as well as the gas velocity were also investigated. Com-comparisons were also made between converters with electrically heated nets and converters in which the temperature of the net was automatically maintained by the heat evolved in the process of oxidation. It was clearly established that the optimum yield of oxides of nitrogen was obtained when using two or more nets, and that, contrary to some published statements.
a distinctly higher conversion efficiency could be obtained at rapid rates of gas flow when the net was electrically heated. It was also found that the electrically-heated type of apparatus was undoubtedly more convenient to control, and that the precise disposition of the catalyst net had an important effect on the relative efficiency of the process in the two cases where electrical heating was and was not employed. The analytical control of ammonia oxidation was rigorously investigated and an accurate method was elaborated for the estimation of the various oxides of nitrogen produced. Upon the basis of the above work, double-net converters of simple design and of different sizes were eventually evolved. Under favourable circum-stances, the oxidation efficiency of these converters, i.e., the ratio of the output of fixed nitrogen, in the form of oxides of nitrogen to the input of ammonia nitrogen, approached 98 per cent., and the mean efficiency over a wide range of experiments under varying conditions and during continuous runs was above 90 per cent. At the maximum rate of gas flow, the output of the apparatus was very high, amounting to 1*5 metric tons of nitric acid (calculated as 100 per cent.) per square foot of double net per 24 hours, which is much in excess of the output of the old Ostwald. converter (Appendix V., Section VII.),332. Some of the more important of the results noted above were embodied in a booklet which, in accordance with the decision of Dr. Addison in March 1917, was widely circulated to controlled firms and others likely to be interested in the ammonia oxidation process. Converters of the type described and illustrated in that booklet and operated in the manner suggested by the experience gained in the above research have been installed in various chemical works for the production of the oxides of nitrogen required in the manufacture of chamber sulphuric acid and are giving satisfactory results. Arrangements have been made by the Controller of Munitions Inventions for the sale to the public through H.M. Stationery Office of a revised edition of the illustrated booklet, entitled The Oxidation of Ammonia applied to Vitriol Chamber Plants.333. There has been a free interchange of information between the Department and the firms interested in developing the process and in some cases conducting independent investigations. Conferences and trial demonstrations have taken place at the research laboratories and at the works of the firms in question and have contributed in no small measure to the general progress.334. Attention is called to the fact that the results of the experimental and trial work were utilised by the Department of Explosives Supply in preparing the designs for the ammonia oxidation section of the National Factory previously referred to.335. An investigation of the effect of substituting enriched air or oxygen for ordinary air as an oxidising agent showed that the use of a diluent was necessary to restrain the reaction, owing to the explosive character of a wide range of mixtures of ammonia and oxygen. A method has been worked out in detail which offers distinct prospects as the basis of a technical process for the production of stronger nitric acid than that usually obtained, with a great reduction in the tower space hitherto necessary for a given yield.336. The question of the absorption of oxides of nitrogen by water has received considerable attention. One of the most definite outcomes of this study is a clear indication that in order to ensure the maximum efficiency of an absorption tower system, the earlier towers in which relatively strong nitric acid is produced should, contrary to the normal practice, be maintained at a much lower temperature than the later towers in which relatively weak acid is formed.337. Results of an interesting character have also been obtained in the course of a research upon dry and wet absorption processes for the direct preparation of nitrates from oxides of nitrogen. For example, a method has been worked out whereby nitrates free from nitrites can be obtained in a simple and direct manner by the interaction of oxides of nitrogen and a solution or suspension of alkali or alkaline earth oxides. It was found, however, that ammonium nitrate could not be economically prepared by similar wet methods, and investigations were therefore made in order to determine the possibility of the direct production of this nitrate by the combination of ammonia with oxides of nitrogen.. After a long series of experiments it was found possible to develop a process of this character and to obtain a pure dry synthetic ammonium nitrate free from nitrite. Under definite conditions, the solid product can be obtained with a&apos; loss of combined nitrogen equivalent to about 10 per cent, of the ammonia used in the nitrate stage, and from the technical standpoint the method appears to hold out distinct prospects of success.LIAISON WITH ALLIED GOVERNMENTS.338. Throughout the work of the Committee, a close and cordial liaison has been main-tained with Allied Governments through technical officers specially delegated to confer on the different aspects of the nitrogen problem. This liaison has perhaps been closest in regard to research and trial operations, and, in addition to a free interchange of views, numerous con-ferences have been held for the critical discussion of the problems in hand. The results of the investigations carried out at the Departmental Research Laboratories have been placed at the disposal of the Allied Governments for war purposes, and, reciprocally, the Committee has been furnished with details of experimental and trial operations in progress in France, Italy,
Russia and the United States, and also with a considerable amount of information upon the technical and other aspects of established processes for nitrogen fixation.339. The Committee and the Director of Research desire to take this opportunity of expressing their high appreciation of the services rendered by the Liaison Officers of the countries mentioned, and their satisfaction at the cordial personal relationships that have been established. It is perhaps not out of place to mention that reference has been made by these Liaison Officers on more than one occasion to the high quality and rapid progress of the research work undertaken in this country under war conditions.OTHER OBSERVATIONS.340. In addition to the reports embodying the results of actual experimental work, a considerable amount of information concerning the technical details of various processes is contained in memoranda of interviews with specialists compiled by the Director, by members of the Research Staff, and by other officers of the Department. Other reports embody the results of visits to British and foreign works undertaken in &quot;connection with definite experimental problems.341. The task of preparing the accumulated reports for ultimate publication in full, together with the numerous diagrams and curves which will be necessary to give the information its full value, is a somewhat formidable one and will undoubtedly occupy several months. Nevertheless,&apos; the Committee is unanimously of the opinion that the material should be correlated under the general editorship of the Director of Research and published in due course as a further and independent Appendix to this Report.jl XX XVin-THE EFFECT OF THE WAR ON THE NITROGEN INDUSTRIES AND on future POLICY.342. Of all the industrial developments and re-adjustments occasioned by the war, the modifications that have been brought about in the nitrogen industries are certainly among the most remarkable. Associated primarily with agriculture before the war, these industries were suddenly confronted with the twofold problem of providing not only the nitrogenous fertilisers essential for maintaining the world&apos;s supplies of food, but also the forms of combined nitrogen vital to the production of explosives. The large demand for munitions, even in the early days of the war, undoubtedly caused the needs of agriculture to be relegated to a secondary position, and this condition of affairs was accentuated by the constantly increasing demand for explosives.343. As long ago as 1898, attention had been drawn by Sir William Crookes to the increase in the wheat-consuming population of the world, to the possibility of a world shortage of food, and to the necessity for augmenting the production by the more extended use of nitrogenous fertilisers. Although there appeared to be no immediate prospect of such a shortage prior to the war, the diminished productiveness of large tracts of soil that had been cultivated for long periods without fertilisation pointed to difficulties in the future. A situation that might have developed gradually over a period of years has, however, been precipitated by the war, owing to the fact that all the principal food-producing countries of the world have become involved, imposing an unprecedented drain upon the man-power normally engaged in agri-oulture. As a consequence, the food problem has become the most important consideration for all the belligerents, and although efforts have been made by the different nations to maintain and even augment their food supplies, the difficulties of the situation have been added to by the lack of sufficient fertilisers, because the nitrogen industries, notwithstanding their large expansion during the war,.have been unable to cope with the double demand for explosives and fertilisers.344. The war developments have been brought about not only by the abnormal demand, but also by reason of the isolation of the Central Powers from overseas supplies of such essential materials as nitrates. These factors have led to a striking readjustment as regards the principal consumers of Chile nitrate during the war period, and have also compelled the Central Powers to develop internal resources in order to make up, as far as possible, the deficiency in nitrogenous products caused by the stoppage of external supplies.345. Before dealing with the war position of individual countries, a brief examination will be made of the general trend of the principal nitrogen industries of the world during the &apos; period 1913-1917. In the special circumstances prevailing, the statistics are necessarily incomplete, and although they comprise many figures from official sources, they also include a number of estimates derived from private sources. While it is probable that some of the estimates are in fair accord with the actual situation, the figures as a whole cannot be regarded as having the authority possessed by those available for the pre-war period.
THE CHILE NITRATE INDUSTRY.346. The statistics available for the production, exportation, and visible stocks of Chile nitrate during the years 1913-1917, are summarised in Table 38.Table 38.

The production in 1916 and 1917 was higher than any previously recorded, and it is apparent that the loss of the German market has been more than counterbalanced by the war demand of the Allies and the requirements of other countries. On the other hand, there has been an increasing accumulation of stocks on-the Chilean coast, the shipments to the American and European markets having been hampered by the lack of tonnage and the great increase in the cost of freight. The following table gives an indication of the scale of the shipments to Europe and the United States, and the total exports for each six months of the years 1915-1917.-Table 39.

The United States, which was the second largest consumer of Chile nitrate under pre-war conditions, lias become the market for very much larger quantities than formerly, and the actual deliveries during the first six months only of 1916 and 1917 respectively are stated to have amounted to 674,138 and 688,566 metric tons, or more than the total annual consumption in that country prior to the wrar.349. In consequence of the general increase in the working costs in Chile, of the enhanced charges for freight, and of the adverse influence of the rate of exchange, the market price of Chile nitrate in the United Kingdom has risen substantially during the war period, amounting to  12*65 per long ton in 1915, to  17 &quot;62 per ton in 1916, to about  23&apos;5 per ton in the first half of 1917, and to  27 per ton in the latter half. As compared with the pre-war price (average 1911-1913) of  10&apos;69 per ton, the last figure represents an increase of over 150 per cent. ^350. There has also been a substantial increase in the cost of manufacture of concentrated nitric acid by the retort process, owing to the enhanced cost of Chile nitrate, pyrites, sulphur, and strong sulphuric acid. The production cost had risen to about  30 per long ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) early in 1917, and has since increased to about  35 per ton, an advance of over 50 per cent, upon the pre-war cost which amounted to about  23 per long ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.).
THE BY-PRODUCT AMMONIA INDUSTRY.351. The extension of the coke-oven industry during the war period consequent upon the augmented production of iron and steel, has been accompanied by a substantial increase in the output of by-product ammonia, more particularly in Germany and. the United States. Detailed statistics for the by-product industry have not been published by some of the belligerent countries, but Table 40, compiled from official and estimated data; gives a general indication of the trend of ammonia production in the principal countries.Table 40.-THE BY-PRODUCT AMMONIA INDUSTRY (War Period).Country.

Comparing the estimated production in 1917 with the output in 1913, an increase of ] 30 per cent, is indicated in the case of the United States, an increase of 27 per cent, in the case of Germany, and an increase of only 6 per cent, in the case of the United Kingdom. Of the smaller producing countries, the advance of Japan is the most striking, the estimated output for 1917 being over six times that in 1913. It may he noted that the production of ammonium sulphate from coke-ovens in the United States in 1916 was over 55 per cent, greater than in 1913 and accounted for over 83 per cent, of the total output as compared with about 78 per cent, in 1913.353. The market price of ammonium sulphate in the United Kingdom rose to  14&apos; 4 per long ton in 1915 and to  17&apos; 23 per ton in 1916. In the latter part of that year the price was controlled, and in the early part of 1917 it was fixed by a Government Committee at  15&apos;5 per ton at the works or  16 per ton delivered. The pre-war price (average 1911-13) amounted to  13&apos; 83 per long ton.THE SYNTHETIC INDUSTRIES.354. The most notable features revealed by the present position of the synthetic industries are the marked alteration in the character of the Norwegian nitrate industry, the remarkable development of the Haber or synthetic ammonia process in Germany, and the great expansion &quot;in the production of cyanamide both in Germany and in other countries.The Norwegian Industry.355. Dealing in the first place wdth the Norwegian industry, the table given below for the exportation of synthetic nitrogen products provides an interesting indication of the modifications brought about by the war.Table 41.-NORWEGIAN NITROGEN INDUSTRY (War Period).Product exported.

356. The general use of ammonium nitrate as a constituent of, high explosives lids led to an immense demand, and it is clear that the nitric acid manufactured by the arc process in Norway has been diverted to an increasing extent from the lime nitrate inaustry to the ammonium nitrate industry. It is also apparent that a substantial proportion or uie nome production of cyanamide has been utilised for making the ammonia required for the ammonium nitrate industry instead of being exported for fertilising purposes as formerly. On the other hand, it has been stated (Handelsberichten, June 13th, 1918) that the home consumption of nitrogenous fertilisers in Norway increased from a pre-war figure of 6,000 to 7,000 tons per annum to 20,000 tons in 1917, and that it would amount to from 55,000 to 60,000 tons in 1918.357. The market price of ammonium nitrate in the United Kingdom rose in 1916 to  59&quot; 58 per long ton, an increase of more than 66 per cent, upon the pre-war price (average 1911-13), of  35-75 per ton.. Development of the Haber Process.358. With regard to the development of the Haber process in Germany, the figures in Table 42 were put forward in 1916 as representing, in terms of ammonium sulphate, the actual production of synthetic ammonia during the years 1913-15 and the estimated production in 1916 and 1917.Table 42.

Figures of the same order for the period 1914-16 were also supplied to the Committee in February, 1916, in a confidential report from another source.359. If the production of synthetic ammonia upon a scale even approximating to the estimated output for 1916-17 has actually been accomplished, the war efforts of Germany in this field alone would represent an unparallelled technical achievement when account is taken of the highly specialised character of the process, which was only brought to the com-mercial stage in 1913, of the skilled requirements demanded in the erection and running of the plant, and of the quantity and quality of the necessary hydrogen.Expansion of the Cyanamide Industry.360. The cyanamide process has also come into great prominence during the war period, principally as a method of obtaining ammonia nitrogen for munitions.   No official figures have been published by the different countries as to the actual output of cyanamide, but Table 43 embodies the estimates that have been made by various experts.Table 43.-CYANAMIDE PROCESS (War Period).Country. *	Quantities in Metric Tons.				1913.	1914.	1915.	1916.Austria-Hungary.....

361. The estimates of different authorities for the production of cyanamide in Germany in 1915 and 1916 vary from 400,000 to 600,000 tons, and the figure of 500,000 tons adopted in the above table was considered by the experts to be not far from the reality. On the other hand, information from another source (Frankfurter Handelsblatt, May 29th, 1916) places the estimated production at 400,000 metric tons for the year 1917.362. Comparing the estimated production for 1916 with the production in 1913, the figures in the table indicate an output of over 20-fold in the case or Germany, of over 13-fold in the case of France, of about 5-fold in the case of Norway and Sweden and of over 3-fold in the cases of Japan, Switzerland and Austria, the estimated world&apos;s productive capacity in 1916 being over six times the production in 1913.363. There has been a notable development of more recent date in the United States where I wo large cyanamide installations are in course of erection for the manufacture of munitions. The productive capacity of each installation is equivalent to 110,000 tons of ammonium nitrate per annum. If allowance is made for losses in the -various stages of the manufacture of ammonium nitrate from cyanamide vid the ammonia oxidation process, the two installations represent an approximate productive capacity of 85,000 tons of fixed nitrogen, or 425,000 tons of cyanamide (20 per cent. N.) per annum.364. The market price of cyanamide in the United Kingdom under pre-war conditions (average 1911-1913) amounted to  10&apos;62 per long ton of product containing 18 per cent, of nitrogen or 58&apos;l per metric ton of combined nitrogen. The price in 1916 for a product containing 15&apos;5 per cent, of nitrogen amounted to  13 &quot;16 per long ton, or  83 &quot;6 per metric ton of combined nitrogen, an increase of about 44 per cent.SUMMARY OF PRE-WAR AND WAR FIGURES.365. The figures given in the following table are based upon a published statement as to the relation between the installed capacity for nitrogen fixation in 1913 and that at the beginning of 1916 : Table 44.-INSTALLED CAPACITY POR NITROGEN FIXATION.

If the above figures are taken in conjunction with those given in previous tables for the production or estimated productive capacity of the nitrogen industries in the years 1916-1917 and also for the output in 1913, the pre-war and war positions are shown to be approximately as follows in round figures: Table 45.- NITROGEN INDUSTRIES COMPARED.Summary of Pre-war and War Positions.

367. According to these figures, the synthetic industries have expanded by nearly 300 per cent, during the short interval of three or four years, and are now responsible for about 30 per cent, of the world&apos;s production of or productive capacity for combined nitrogen as compared with about 11 per cent, in 1913.THE AMMONIA OXIDATION PROCESS.368. Although nitric acid and nitrates are by far the most important forms of combined nitrogen needed in the manufacture of explosives, it will be observed that the two fixation processes developed to the largest extent during the war are ammonia-producing processes. The arc process for the direct production of nitric acid from the air has been installed or extended on a comparatively limited scale in some of the belligerent countries, but the large power requirements of the process per unit of nitrogen fixed and the extensive character of the necessary chemical installation have constituted serious handicaps to the production by this method of a really substantial portion of the military requirements for nitric acid. Whereas the Allied nations were in a position to draw upon supplies of Chile nitrate for the manufacture of nitric acid, the Central Powers were compelled to resort to other expedients, and the solution of their problem was found in the adoption of the ammonia oxidation process for converting ammonia nitrogen into nitric nitrogen. This process can hardly be said to have achieved commercial success prior to the war. and Germany was thus faced with the task of bringing a practically untried process to the producing stage on an enormous scale in addition to providing the necessary ammonia.369. It has been stated that by 1916 the ammonia oxidation process was developed in Germany to the extent of producing nitric acid at the rate of 120,000 tons per annum. On the other hand, a detailed report supplied to the Committee from a private source places the output of ammonia oxidation plants by the middle of 1916 at 30,000 tons of sodium nitrate per month, equivalent to an annual output of over 250,000 tons of nitric acid. The sodium nitrate is said to be transported to the large explosive factories and used in lieu of Chile nitrate for the production of concentrated nitric acid by the retort process. The reason given for the manufacture of sodium nitrate rather than of nitric acid at the ammonia oxidation plants is that soda lye absorption plant can be installed with great facility as compared with the erection of acid absorption towers and concentrating plant for the resulting dilute acid. It also appears that the policy might have been dictated by the difficulty of transporting nitric acid in bulk, and by the necessity for utilising existing factories devoted to the manufacture of explosives and sulphuric acid and for avoiding the multiplication of such factories at the ammonia oxidation installations.370. According to other estimates, the annual consumption of nitric acid in Germany for military purposes has been placed at from 250,000 to about 365,000 tons (Washburn: Statement before House Committee on Military Affairs, U.S.A., Feb. 11th, 1916; Landis : Metallurgical and Chemical Engineering, Vol. XIV., p. 260, and pp. 513-515, 1916). Having regard to the enormous increase in the expenditure of ammunition during the progress of the war, it appears, from the information available to the Committee, to be by no means improbable that the military requirements of the Central Powers for 1917 amounted to at least 150,000 metric tons of combined nitrogen. If the requirements for nitric and nitrate nitrogen are taken at 100,000 metric tons, equivalent to 450,000 metric tons of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.), the vital importance of the ammonia oxidation process to the Central Powers is apparent.371. The process has also found an extensive application in Germany as a method of supplying the oxides of nitrogen required in the manufacture of sulphuric acid by the leaden chamber process, the lack of Chile nitrate being responsible for this development.372. Use has also been made of the process by the Allied nations, although not on a scale comparable -with that indicated above, since there has not been the same necessity for relying entirely upon home resources for the production of nitric nitrogen as has been the case with the Central Powers.373. Although there would appear to be little likelihood of a repetition of the special combination of circumstances characterising the present war, nevertheless a precedent has been set by which the requirements of modern warfare must be measured. It is important, therefore, to summarise the figures available for the nitrogen requirements of Germany, to indicate as far as possible the position of the United Kingdom, and to examine the bearing of the financial and other aspects of a war demand upon the question of future policy.THE POSITION IN GERMANY.374. In dealing with the pre-war position of the nitrogen industries, it was shown that Germany was the workTs largest producer and consumer of by-product ammonium sulphate, and the world&apos;s largest consumer of Chile nitrate. The following figures have been quoted for the total- consumption of nitrogen products in Germany in the year prior to the&quot;&quot;wai\

Taking the figure for cyanamide as representing home production and that for nitrate of lime as representing imports, the German production of combined nitrogen in 1913 amounted to 110,000 metric tons, over 94 per cent, of this being in the form of ammonia nitrogen. The supply of nitrate and nitric nitrogen required for agriculture and industrial purposes was thus wholly dependent upon imported products.376. Allowing for a steady increase in the annual consumption, say, of the order of 5 per cent., the German demand for the year 1917 would, under normal conditions, have amounted to about 265,000 metric tons of combined nitrogen. To this must be added the huge war demand, mainly for nitric nitrogen, and as previously indicated the requirements for military purposes in 1917 may be placed at 150,000 metric tons of nitrogen. Upon the basis of the home production in 1913, the total requirements for 1917, namely, 415,000 metric tons of fixed nitrogen, show a deficit of 305,000 metric tons, and the cessation of imports rendered it essential to make up this deficit as far as possible by augmenting home production. The extent to which the various nitrogen industries were expanded has already been indicated, and the figures for the estimated production in 1917 are summarised in Table 47. There is no doubt that the synthetic installations already in operation on a moderate scale prior to the Avar proved of the utmost value in furnishing both a nucleus for rapid extension and also the necessary experience.Table 47.-GERMAN PRODUCTION OP NITROGEN PRODUCTS.Estimate for 1917.Process or Product.

These figures represent an increase of about 200 per cent, on the pre-war home production and are probably not altogether complete. For example, other estimates place the production of cyanamide in 1917 at 500,000 and even at 600,000 metric tons, and it is known that a certain amount of nitric nitrogen is being obtained by means of the arc process. It is also possible that other methods of obtaining combined nitrogen, such as the Hausser process, are in operation. In the absence of water powers adequate for the large-scale operation of the arc process, Germany has been compelled to rely almost entirely upon ammonia-producing processes for obtaining fixed nitrogen, thus necessitating the development of the ammonia oxidation process in order to provide the nitric nitrogen essential for munitions.378. It is clear that many industrial requirements have had to give Avay to military demands, and according to statements made in the German press there appear to have been considerable deficiencies in the supply of nitrogenous fertilisers. Even when allowance is made for these factors, the augmentation in the home production must be regarded as a remarkable achievement, especially when it is remembered that the estimated output of fixed nitrogen in 1917 is almost equivalent to the total production of the Chile nitrate industry in the year prior to the war,
379. The nitrogen fixation industries developed in Germany during the war period represent post-war assets of considerable value, and it is probable that they will not only enable that country to meet increasing internal requirements for ammonia and cyanamide nitrogen for some years to come, but will place her in a strong position for competing in the nitrogen markets of other countries.THE POSITION IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.380. Before the war, the United Kingdom produced and exported large quantities of ammonia nitrogen, but was a relatively small consumer of all forms of fixed nitrogen, depending, like Germany, upon imported products for all requirements in respect of nitrate and nitric nitrogen.381. At the outbreak of war there were no nitrogen fixation processes in operation in this country capable of serving as a nucleus for rapid extension, as was the case in Germany, and during the war period, the United Kingdom, having command of the seas, has been in a position to depend upon overseas supplies.382. The principal figures that can be given for the period 1914-1917 are those relating to the by-product ammonia industry, and are based upon statistics in the Annual Reports of the Alkali Inspector and upon others supplied by the Board of Trade. Table 48, in which all forms of ammoniacal compounds are expressed in terms of ammonium sulphate, indicates the scale of production, the extent of the exports, and the estimated home consumption of ammonia nitrogen during the war. For purposes of comparison, corresponding data are given for the year prior to the war.Table 48.-BRITISH PRODUCTION, EXPORTS, AND CONSUMPTION OP AMMONIANITROGEN.

The most significant points revealed by the above figures, which may be compared with those given in Table 18, on page 20, are as follows :  (a) The home production of ammonia nitrogen exhibited a decline during the years 1914 and 1915, a recovery in 1916, and a moderate increase in 1917 ; the increase, however, only amounted to about 6 per cent, on the output for 1913.(b) Large quantities of ammonium sulphate, amounting in 1915 to nearly 70 per cent, and in 1916 to nearly 60 per cent, of the total production of ammonia nitrogen, were exported from this country even after the outbreak of war. This not only depleted the supplies of sulphate for agricultural purposes, but also involved the consumption of large quantities of sulphuric acid for which there was a greatly increased demand for munitions. It is worthy of note that the exported ammonium sulphate represented a minimum consumption of 294,000 tons of chamber acid in 1915, and a minimum of 259,500 tons in 1916. .U  6619 F
384. The position of the by-product ammonia industry as known to tho Committee in the early part of 1917 was dealt with in some detail in the Interim Report, a summary of which is given in an Appendix to this Report (Appendix I.),385. With regard to the consumption of nitrogen products for munitions in the United Kingdom during the war period, it has been represented to the Committee that the publication of details or of approximate figures would be inadvisable at the present date.THE INFLUENCE OF THE WAR ON FUTURE POLICY.386. The positions of the United Kingdom and of the Central Powers afford a unique illustration of the two extreme situations that may arise in the case of war. On the one hand, it has been possible for the United Kingdom, possessing maritime supremacy, to place entire reliance upon overseas supplies for meeting all requirements in respect of nitrate and nitric nitrogen. On the other hand, there has existed in the case of the Central Powers the necessity for relying entirely upon internal resources for all the nitrogen products required for military, agricultural, and industrial purposes, and the war efforts of Germany have demonstrated the important fact that, given sufficient nucleus plant and experience of &quot;nitrogen fixation processes,, it is possible to dispense with Chile nitrate and to meet an enormous war demand for such vital products as nitric acid and nitrates by the use of synthetic methods alone.387. It is clear that the demand for nitrogen products for military purposes in the near future will depend largely on the conditions upon which peace is made. There is no doubt, however, that when provision comes to be - made to safeguard the future, the lessons learnt during the war will strongly influence nations towards a policy either of rendering themselves independent of external supplies of essential nitrogen compounds, or at least of making sufficient provision in the way of nucleus installations to permit of rapid extension in the case of emergency.388. The present position, as illustrated by the cases of the United Kingdom and Germany, has clearly demonstrated the essential factors that must operate in moulding future policy, and of these finance and shipping are the principal. It is, therefore, essential to examine their significance as far as it is possible to do so in the light of the data available.389. Having regard to the fact that the ammonia oxidation and Haber processes only j attained a large-scale development during the war period, it is obvious that a comparison ! of the economic aspects of synthetic and non-synthetic processes under pre-war and war conditions can only be of an approximate character.   Nevertheless, the estimated pre-war costs of operation given inTables 35 and 36 (see pp. 55 and 56) afford a useful basis for a broad consideration of the question of future policy in the light of the following assumptions: (a) That a war demand for 100,000 metric tons of nitric nitrogen per annum, i.e., of the magnitude indicated in the case of the Central Powers, would have to be met. (6) That the nitric acid would be mainly required in the concentrated form.(c) That any or all of the synthetic processes, including the ammonia oxidation process, Avould be available for adoption.(d) That reliance upon the non-synthetic or retort process would involve the importation not only of Chile nitrate, but also of pyrites or sulphur for use in the-j. manufacture of the necessary sulphuric acid.* Comparison of Nitric Acid Processes.390. The relative positions of the different methods of obtaining concentrated nitric acid are shown in Table 49, which embodies figures for power requirements, quantities of raw materials, and capital and operating costs. The various figures include allowances for reasonable manufacturing losses.391. The production of the whole of a war demand for nitric nitrogen by means of the arc process would clearly be out of the question on account of the magnitude of the power requirements. In this connection it may be recalled that Germany made no effort to rely upon the well-established arc process, but resorted instead to the ammonia oxidation process, a comparatively untried method of obtaining nitric acid on a large scale. The power problem in the case of the cyanamide process-would also be a formidable one ; seeing, however, that the estimated German production of cyanamide. alone in 1917 represented the equivalent of at least 160,000 kw.-years, the difficulty cannot be regarded as insuperable in the event of war necessity. :.392. Very large quantities of coal and other raw materials are needed for the different processes, the total fuel requirements alone amounting to 1,870,000 tons for the cyanamide process, to 805,000 tons for the Haber process, and to 638,000 tons if reliance were placed upon the oxidation of by-product ammonia. Upon the basis of average gasworks practice, it would be necessary to carbonise some 46,000,000 tons of coal in order to obtain the requisite amount of by-product ammonia.

The raw materials for the synthetic processes would be obtainable from home sources, but the Chile nitrate and pyrites required for the retort process, amounting in all to 1,181,000 tons, would have to be imported. Upon the basis of pre-war market prices, the total value of the latter materials would amount to about  8,000,000. It is clear, therefore, that the cost of importation under tear conditions would be very considerable, while dependence&apos; upon foreign supplies to the above extent would represent a large demand on shipping. Assuming the employment of steamers each capable of carrying about 5,000 tons :dead weight and making three round voyages per annum between Chile and Europe, the requirements for nitrate alone would necessitate the constant service of a fleet of about 4-8 steamers.394. The capital outlay required for installing the cyanamideand Haber processes is large, amounting to nearly four times the cost of retort process plant of equal capacity, or to nearly three times if account is taken of the pre-war capital cost of the shipping necessary for the importation of Chile nitrate. The present high capital- value of shipping shows that the disparity indicated above would be&quot; very much less under war conditions, or perhaps even disappear.395. On the other hand, the estimated pre-war costs of production by the synthetic methods, even when reliance has to be placed upon steam-generated power, show a very large margin as compared with the cost incurred in the retort process. Thus, in the cases of the cyanamide and Haber processes, the estimated costs are respectively 46 and 56 per cent, lower than by the retort process; there is also a margin of 10 per cent, in the case of the ammonia oxidation process with by-product ammonia charged at its full pre-war market price.F %Table 49.-PRODUCTION OF CONCENTRATED NITRIC ACID.Scale : 100,000 Metric Tons oe Fixed Nitrogen Pee Annum: Comparison of Processes on basis of Pre-war Conditions in United Kingdom.
It is evident that the synthetic methods show great advantages, the annual saving under pre-war conditions on a production of 100,000 metric tons of nitric nitrogen being of the order of  4,600,000. or  5,600,000. In war time there would be substantial increases in the production costs of all the processes, but these would undoubtedly be greatest in the case of a process necessitating the importation of overseas supplies of raw materials. It follows, therefore, that the relative advantages of the synthetic methods would be still more pronounced under war conditions, and this would hold good even if the proportionate increase in the operating costs were the same for all the processes.396. Finally, it must be noted that a country resorting to synthetic methods for meeting a war demand would not be compelled to rely upon a single process only, but could adopt the combination of processes best suited to home resources of power supply and raw materials.OBSERVATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS.397. From a general review of the war aspects of the nitrogen problem in the light of the conditions of modern warfare, it is possible to draw a number of important deductions, which are summarised below.398. In the event of reliance being placed upon the retort process for meeting a war demand of the magnitude assumed, it appears that (a) A country must be prepared to face a heavy demand on shipping, a large advance in the price of imported raw materials, and a consequential increase in the costs of the products manufactured from them. The longer the duration of a war, the more serious would these increases become.(b) The advances in price and in manufacturing costs, although partly due to the enormous increase in the demand and to the economic conditions prevailing in war time, would be largely attributable to the necessity for importing essential raw materials.(c) Of the total expenditure incurred in connection with a war demand, a large proportion would be represented by payments abroad at a time when the rate of exchange was adverse.(d) Only a very small proportion of the retort process plant could find an application under peace conditions, on account of the great disparity between the war and peace demand for nitric acid.(e) Two years&apos; expenditure upon imported raw materials at war prices would alone more than cover the estimated pre-war capital outlay for synthetic installations capable of furnishing the same output.399. In the event of reliance being placed upon synthetic methods for meeting a war demand of the magnitude assumed, it appears that (a) A country must be prepared to face a large initial capital, outlay.(6) The advances in the price of materials and in manufacturing costs would be governed by internal conditions only. On account, however, of the substantial advantage shown by synthetic methods, an all-round increase of even 50 per cent, in the estimated pre-war production costs would still leave them on a parity with the pre-war costs of the retort process.(c) A large proportion of the synthetic plant would find an application under peace conditions for the manufacture of nitrogenous fertilisers, either for home consumption or for exportation.(d) As compared with the retorf process, the saving in the running costs over a period of two years would probably cover the initial capital outlay.400. Two other pertinent facts have also been demonstrated during the course of the war, namely: (a) That very serious risks are involved in relying upon overseas shipments of raw materials.(6) That the nitrogen fixation processes are thoroughly reliable, even when installed as emergency measures under war conditions.401. The conclusion seems evident that considerations of national safety, of finance, and of utility, would force a country tq resort to the policy of adopting synthetic methods as an insurance against future emergencies, instead of placing reliance upon the importation of Chile nitrate.
IX.-POST-WAR ASPECTS OF THE NITROGEN PROBLEM.402. Various circumstances arising out of the war will have an important bearing upon the post-war situation in regard to the demand for, and available supplies of, nitrogen products, and the prices at which they will be procurable. In the first place, the conditions upon which peace is made will determine the scale of armaments to be maintained by various nations, and therefore the provision to be made for ensuring security against future emergencies. The lessons afforded by the war upon this aspect of the nitrogen problem have already been indicated. In the next place, the effects of the war.upon the production of food and the level of subsistence in many countries have already substantially modified the world-status of agriculture, which consumed, about three-quarters of the entire output of fixed nitrogen before the war. Moreover, there has been an expansion in a number of industries depending upon . nitrogen products as raw materials. In the last place, the existing productive capacity now devoted primarily to military purposes is potentially available at the termination of the war for meeting the needs of agriculture and industry. The actual scale of the post-war supplies, and also the price of fixed nitrogen, will depend, however, upon the economic conditions confronting the nitrogen industries and the nature and extent of international competition.403. Dealing broadly with the post-war demand, the requirements of agriculture are certain &apos; to be much larger than formerly, the imperative need for maintaining and extending the world&apos;s production of food, and the vital importance of combined nitrogen for this purpose, having emerged as the salient lessons of the later stages of the war.404. The consumption of combined nitrogen practically doubled in the ten years before the war. In evidence given before the Committee it was stated that owing to advances upon the former backward state of scientific knowledge concerning the use of nitrogenous fertilisers, the future consumption could not be expected to continue to increase at the same rate. The Com-mittee is unable to agree with this view for the following reasons. When account is taken of the relative areas under cultivation in the food-producing countries of the world, of the pre-war consumption of nitrogenous fertilisers in the most progressive of the agricultural countries, and of the corresponding consumption in the remaining countries, it is abundantly clear that the quantities of nitrogenous manures employed were in many cases below the most advantageous or profitable level. The difficulties experienced during the war period in obtaining supplies have already provided a salutary lesson as to the importance of fertilisa-tion, and the resulting wider recognition of the value of fertilisers will lead to a large increase in the demand for nitrogenous manures in countries where the consumption has hitherto been very small in proportion to the area under cultivation. In the opinion of the Committee, the provision of a really cheap supply of fixed nitrogen, say, at  40 to  45 per metric ton, or 8s. to 9s. per unit and. the figures previously given show that this is possible  would lead to a greatly extended consumption of nitrogenous fertilisers.405. There will also be an increased industrial demand for fixed nitrogen, especially in the nitric form, for the majority of purposes for which it has hitherto been employed, particularly for the production of artificial dyes and drugs in countries, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, which have had to resort to their manufacture on a considerable scale since the outbreak of war. Nevertheless, the total requirements for industry are unlikely to amount to more than a relatively small proportion of the demand for agriculture.VISIBLE OR POTENTIAL SUPPLIES OF FIXED NITROGEN.406. The question as to the scale of the supplies of combined nitrogen likely to be available after the war is one of great importance, and the position will therefore be briefly reviewed in . the light of the figures previously given, and of other data accessible to the Committee. The latest pre-war figures for the world&apos;s visible supplies of nitrogen products for 1914 were as follows : Table 50.-WORLD&apos;S VISIBLE SUPPLIES OF NITROGEN PRODUCTS IN 1914.Product. -	Product. Metric tons.	Combined Nitrogen. Metric tons.Is Chile nitrate      -         -Ammonium sulphate      ....

407. From. Table 45 and other data given in a previous section of this Report, it appears that the following approximate productive capacity may bo available for meeting the world&apos;s demand after the war: Table 51.-POSSIBLE POST-WAR ANNUAL PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY.Industry or Process.

According to an independent estimate from an authoritative source given in evidence before the Committee, the potential output of ammonium sulphate is also placed at the total given in the above table.409. When allowance is made for the uncertainty attaching to many of the Avar figures, and for other developments that are knoAvn to have been in progress between 1917 and the present date, a careful revieAv of the evidence available points to the conclusion that a produc-tive capacity of the order of 1,000,000 tons or more of combined nitrogen per annum will be available for the world&apos;s requirements at the termination of the Avar, or an increase of some 30 or 40 per cent, upon the visible supplies for 1914.410. It is of the highest&quot;importance to observe that in spite of the developments and readjustments occasioned by the Avar, the increase in the Avorld&apos;s production of fixed nitrogen does not appear to be greater than would have been the case under normal conditions had the ordinary rate of growth in consumption in the pre-Avar period been maintained during the last four years.. 411. A further insight into the relation betAveen tlie pre-war position and the prospective situation after the Avar is afforded by combining the above tables as follows :-Table 52.-COMPARISON OP WORLD&apos;S PRE-WAR AND POSSIBLE POST-WARPOSITIONS.

The most significant features revealed by the above table are as follows : (a) The three established nitrogen, fixation processes accounted for about 10 per cent, of the Avorld&apos;s visible supply of fixed nitrogen in 1914, whereas the post-war output of these industries may account for 28 per cent, of the available supplies as compared Avith 30 per cent, in the case of the by-product ammonia industry and 41 per cent, in that of the Chile nitrate industry.
(b) The post-war production of by-product and synthetic ammonium sulphate may account for 39 per cent, of the available supplies of fixed nitrogen as compared with 41 per cent, in the case of Chile nitrate.413. It is evident from the above figures that the supremacy of the Chile nitrate industry is already being challenged, and the near future holds out the prospect that ammonium sulphate or synthetic nitrogen products may become the dominant factor in the nitrogen market and govern the price of nitrate instead of following it as hitherto.ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CONFRONTING THE NITROGEN INDUSTRIES.414. Consideration must now be given to the possible effects of the cessation of the war upon the worhTs output of fixed nitrogen, and this can best be done by a brief examination of the situation of the three nitrogen industries and of the economic conditions confronting them.The Chile Nitrate Industry.415. Notwithstanding the loss of the large trade with Germany, there has been a marked increase in the output of Chile nitrate during the war period owing to the abnormal demand of other consumers. It is difficult to forecast how far the readjusted conditions will persist after the war, but it is not to be expected that ail of the countries now consuming large quantities of nitrate for munitions will continue to use equally large quantities for agriculture in the years immediately succeeding the war.416. With the cessation of the war demand and the release of a greatly increased production of synthetic nitrogenous fertilisers, there is certain to be keen competition in the nitrogen markets, and it is important to remember that the geographical position of Chile is likely to constitute a serious handicap to her industry as long as a shortage of shipping prevails. In the difficult circumstances ensuing at the termination of the war, a fall in the price of Chile nitrate from its present high level may react adversely upon the less favourably situated nitrate companies, and lead to a falling off in the production. There is also a . possibility of the industry being faced with the permanent loss of at least a portion of the German market for the reasons indicated later.417, The proved utility of Chile nitrate as a fertiliser, however, is such as to ensure its position in agriculture for a long time to come, but the extent of the demand under post war conditions will be largely determined by the price at which the product can be marketed.Possible Reductions in Market Price.418. The principal factors to be considered in dealing with the question of price are: the possibility of reductions in the cost of extraction and in the export duty levied by the Chilean Government, the cost of labour and materials in Chile, and the future of freights. The intro-duction of improved methods of extraction and treatment has been accelerated during the last few years owing to the stimulus of the growing demand for Chile nitrate, and it is confidently anticipated by good authorities that further developments will lead to a substantial reduction in the cost of extraction, amounting to as much as 9cZ. per quintal, or 16s. Qd. per ton. The question as to the future scale of the export duty is more difficult to assess, owing to the fact that the Chilean Government has hitherto depended upon this as its main source of revenue. It must be taken, however, that in the event of severe competition threatening the position of the nitrate industry, the Government would reduce the export duty rather than submit to the loss of the market. The Committee has been authoritatively informed that upon the basis of a reduction of 50 per cent, in the duty, improved methods of extraction would enable the nitrate to be produced for 4s. 3d. per quintal f.o.b. in Chile, and that with freights at their pre-war level, the product could be marketed in Europe for  8 per long ton, corresponding to about  50 per metric ton of combined nitrogen.419. From a detailed examination of other figures, the Committee arrived independently at the conclusion that if the greatest possible reductions were taken at 9d. per quintal in the cost of extraction, 80 per cent in the export duty, and 5s. per ton upon the pre-war rate of freight, the &quot;lowest possible&quot; price at which the nitrate might be marketed in England or on the Continent in the future would amount to  7 per long ton, or  44 per metric ton of combined nitrogen (Appendix V,, Section I.).420. In considering the above figures, it must be remembered that the effect of the war upon rates of wages and the price of materials ^ has been world-wide. In the case of the nitrate industry, the advances during the war period in the cost of labour, fuel, packing, and transport in Chile have amounted to several shillings per quintal, and there are strong reasons for doubting whether such costs will in the future fall to the pre-war level.... All the evidence points to the fact that the production costs, apart from economies in the cost of extraction, are - likely to be higher under post-war than under pre-war conditions, and definite opinions to that effect have been. expressed by competent authorities. When regard is also had to future freights and to possible shortage of shipping, which may he severe for several years, the
81NITROGEN HtODUOTS 00 M \l1TTEE ! FINAL report,Committee considers it doubtful whether the costs of production and marketing under post-war conditions are likely to revert quickly even to the pre-war standard.421. Reductions in the market price of the order previously indicated would entail a serious loss of revenue to the Chilean Government, and also a greatly diminished return upon the capital invested in the industry, and are hardly likely to be contemplated except as a last resort in the event of the severest competition. Although the figures of  7 and  8 per ton of Chile nitrate must therefore be regarded as problematical, they nevertheless provide an indication of the &quot; possible &quot; competitive price that might have to be faced in the future by the manufacturers of other nitrogen products.Life of the Nitrate Deposits.422. Another important factor in the future of the industry is the probable duration of the deposits of nitrate of soda in Chile. The permanence of the deposits formed the subject-matter of an official statement published in 1913, which dealt in some detail with the areas of the explored and unexplored grounds, the estimated quantity of nitrate in the former, and the manner in which the estimate was made. The statement, which is quoted in an Appendix (Appendix V., Section I.), concluded by remarking that there is no fear of the Chilean nitrate deposits being exhausted for 200 years.423. According to further authoritative evidence supplied to the Committee, a more recent report has shown that the life of the explored grounds alone at the present rate of production is of the order of 100 years, without making allowance for the inferior deposits that will be capable of utilisation in the future owing to improvements in the methods of extraction. The average life of the grounds of existing English nitrate companies was stated to be about 37 years.424. In other publications issued by the Nitrate Propaganda Association, it is stated that the explored deposits, on the basis of a minimum content of 10 per cent, of nitrate of soda in the mineral treated, contain 200 million metric tons of utilisable nitrate, i.e., capable of being extracted at an average price (at the deposit) of 3&apos;75 francs (say 3s.) per Spanish quintal. The country would thus be able to market 3,000,000 metric tons per annum for a period of 70 years, but if allowance is made, upon tho basis of past years, for an animal increase in production of 55,000 metric tons, the explored deposits would last only until 1966. (Abstract, Monthly Bulletin of Agricultural Intelligence and Plant Diseases, International Institute of Agriculture, Rome : Year 8, No. 7, July 1917.)425. There are various considerations entering into the question of the probable life of the deposits, such as the scale of the future demand for nitrate, the rate of exhaustion of the richer and most accessible deposits, and the less profitable character of the operations when recourse is had to lower grade and less accessible deposits. These factors will, in turn, be influenced to a substantial degree by future reductions in the market price of the product.426. To sum up, the evidence available affords every reason for believing that the deposits of the raw material &quot; caliche &quot; are adequate for meeting all demands for perhaps a century or more. Their commercial life, as distinguished from their actual capacity, will depend, however, upon the economic factors just mentioned, and it is difficult in consequence to form an estimate of the probable duration of the period of profitable working.The By-Prodcct Ammonia Industry.427. There has been a substantial increase in the recorded and estimated output of by-product ammonia during the war period, principally from works engaged in the manufacture of metallurgical coke, and the maintenance or extension of this output will depend upon the future demand for ammonium sulphate and the competitive price at which the large potential supplies of other nitrogenous fertilisers can be marketed. In passing, it may be noted that the world&apos;s requirements for pig-iron and steel during the period of reconstruction following the war are certain to be largely in excess of the pre-war demand. To this extent, therefore, the conditions are favourable to the maintenance of the increased output of by-product ammonia from the coke-oven industry.428. In consequence of the diversion of Chile nitrate to the manufacture of explosives, and of its high price even when available in restricted quantities, agriculture - has been compelled during the last four years to rely as far as possible upon other nitrogenous fertilisers. Ammonium sulphate has been one of the main resources, especially in countries holding a prominent position in the by-product industry, and its employment in agriculture has greatlv extended. It is unlikely that the present scale of consumption in these countries will be wholly maintained when competing supplies of Chile nitrate and other fertilisers again become available; nevertheless, there is every reason to anticipate that in the countries in question the future demand for sulphate will be much larger than the pre-war requirements.429. The export trade in ammonium sulphate has been materially affected by the war, and the increasing needs of the producing countries have latterly left no surplus for the various countries that previously imported large quantities of the product.   The results consequent
upon the forced cessation of the use of ammonium sulphate render it probable that the food-producing countries will require increased quantities in the near future. On the other hand, several countries which were large importers before the war have themselves become producers of ammonium sulphate and synthetic nitrogen compounds, and the development of new markets will undoubtedly be necessary if the pre-war scale of exportation is to be maintained and extended. The evidence given by several witnesses who have appeared before the Committee indicates that there are large potential markets in tropical and sub-tropical countries where artificial nitrogenous fertilisers have scarcely been used at all hitherto, or at any rate only to a very limited extent, and where conditions would probably favour the employment of ammonium sulphate rather than of Chile nitrate.430. Dealing next with the question of the future, market price, it is important to remember that ammonium sulphate is a by-product, and that the industries engaged in its manufacture are therefore in a position to face the competition of other nitrogenous fertilisers by reason of the fact that the price of products such as coal gas, coke, benzol, tar, and so on, can be raised to compensate for a fall in the market price of &quot;sulphate. It is obvious, however, that there are limitations to such a procedure, and owing to the extent to which the economic positions of the industries are dependent upon the price of sulphate, it is probable that severe competition in the nitrogen market would lead to a falling off in the output of by-product ammonia, especially in the industries in which its recovery is not compulsory. On the other hand, a reasonable reduction in the selling price would greatly stimulate the consumption of ammonium sulphate in agriculture.431. The future of the by-product ammonia industry is closely bound up with the problem of fuel economy, and it must be noted that the potential reserves of ammonia nitrogen represented by the world&apos;s deposits of coal and peat are far in excess of the total nitrogen in the &quot; caliche &quot; deposits in Chile. It has long been recognised that the prosperity of industrial countries is essentially dependent upon the utilisation of their fuel resources to the maximum advantage, and solutions of the question are being sought in various directions. In general, the most promise is held out by methods involving the treatment of fuel with by-product recovery, and the introduction and extensive development of such methods would lead to a notable increase in the production of ammonium sulphate, as indicated in Section TV. (p 44) of the Report and in Appendices (Appendices III. and IV). Their financial economy, however, will be effected to an important degree by the future demand for and market price of ammonia nitrogen, as is apparent from the foregoing observations.The Synthetic Industries,432. The synthetic installations erected for the primary purpose of providing the war demand for explosives can be immediately diverted to the production of fertilisers upon the cessation of the war, and every effort will doubtless be made to utilise their productive capacity to the maximum extent. Having regard to the uneconomical conditions under which many of the installations have been built, and to the fact that a large amount of the auxiliary olant needed for the production of munitions will not be necessary for the manufacture of fertilisers, it is clear that the various Governments must be prepared to write off a considerable proportion of the original capital outlay if the plants are to operate upon a commercial basis.433. The future demand for fertilisers appears to be of such an order that, there is likely to be an adequate market for the synthetic products, each of which has a proved utility in agriculture in particular circumstances. It is also probable that there will be an increased use of ammonium nitrate as an ingredient of safety explosives for mining purposes, and if the drawbacks to the general employment of the product as a fertiliser are successfully overcome a large potential market would be rendered available. As an outcome of the experience gained during the Avar, a crystalline form of ammonium nitrate which does not suffer from the drawback of deliquescence can now be manufactured on a large scale. Developments in these directions would be favourable to the continuation of the manufacture of ammonium nitrate at the arc furnace installations in Norway, the local production of cyanamide providing a convenient and cheap source of the necessary ammonia; they might also lead to the utilisation of a proportion of the ammonia oxidation plants erected for war purposes. Failing the realisation of such developments, the Norwegian factories could readily revert to the manufacture of nitrate of lime, but other uses would then have to be found for the ammonia oxidation plants.434. The progress made prior to the war in the manufacture of synthetic ammonia, and the large-scale developments that have since occurred, point to the conclusion that the Haber process is likely to be one of the most important factors in the future of the nitrogen industries. The evidence available leaAres no doubt that wdien cheap hydrogen is procurable, the process can produce ammonium sulphate at a cost which shows a very large margin as compared with the pre-war market price. It is probable that the producers of synthetic and by-product sulphate in Germany will combine to regulate the price in the home market after the war; but if, as is possible, large quantities of synthetic sulphate are marketed outside that country at a competitive price, there is the prospect of a substantial-fall in the price of by-product sulphate.
435. The calcium cyanamide process, under favourable conditions as regards the supply of raw materials and with electrical energy at a reasonably low price, can produce a cheaper marketable form of fixed nitrogen than any other existing synthetic process. The all-round fertilising value of cyanamide appears, from the results hitherto obtained, to be somewhat lower than that of other artificial nitrogenous manures ; but even when allowance is made for this, the margin over the pre-war market price of combined nitrogen is so substantial&apos;that the cyanamide process will probably play as large a part as the Haber process in the future of the nitrogen industries. The product may also find a growing application as a source of cheap ammonia, for example, in the manufacture of cyanides, and as a raw material for the production of organic products such as urea and nitrate of urea.The Future of the Ammonia Oxidation Process.436. The post-war position of the ammonia oxidation process is more difficult to forecast, because the peace-time demand for nitric acid will certainly not represent more than a small fraction of the military requirements in war-time. There are clear indications that the process will become a permanent factor in the manufacture of sulphuric acid by the leaden chamber process, and there is also the prospect that it will supersede the old retort method of making nitric acid, particularly in Germany where cheap ammonia will be available and large war plants will have to be disposed of. The ammonia oxidation process is well adapted for the manufacture of nitrates and reference has been made above to the influence that an increased demand for ammonium nitrate would have upon the future of the process. With regard, however, to synthetic sodium nitrate and nitrate of lime, it is somewhat doubtful whether these solid fertilisers could be produced economically unless the margin between the price of ammonia and nitrate nitrogen were greater than that existing prior to the war. In the event, however, of supplies of very cheap ammonia and soda ash being available, it is possible that synthetic sodium nitrate could be marketed at a price upon a parity with that of Chile nitrate before the war. Having regard to the enormous scale of the ammonia oxidation installations erected in Germany, to the post-war position of that country as regards economic conditions and international credit, to the shortage of freight, to the essential need of nitrate fertilisers for restoring her agriculture, and to the availability of cheap ammonia from the Haber process, it would not be surprising if the manufacture of synthetic nitrates were resorted to in Germany after the war with the object of rendering the country self-supporting and independent of overseas supplies. The Chile nitrate industry may thus be faced with the partial or even total loss of the German market.INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION.437. There is no question that the&quot; synthetic processes, when operated upon an adequate seals and under favourable conditions, can produce marketable forms of combined nitrogen at costs substantially lower than the prevailing price of combined nitrogen prior to the war. As the synthetic industries may control as much as 30 per cent, of the world&apos;s supplies of fixed nitrogen after the war, there is clearly a prospect of serious competition between the pro-ducers of synthetic and non-synthetic compounds. An attempt must therefore be made to investigate the probable extent of the competition, although the problem is complicated by the uncertainty as to the economic conditions that will prevail in the different countries after the war.438. If, as is to be expected, there are advances upon the pre-war rates of wages and costs of materials, these factors will influence the costs of manufacture and production in all the nitrogen industries, although not to the same extent. In the case of the arc and calcium cyanamide pro-cesses, the future price of coal will be an important consideration when steam-generated power &apos; is relied upon for their operation ; as previously noted, however, the influence of the cost of electrical energy is not so pronounced in the case of the cyanamide process as in that of the arc process. On the other hand, a country favoured with cheap water power but having to rely upon imported raw materials, such as anthracite, coal, coke, and limestone, may enjoy less advantage than hitherto on account of the increased cost of the materials and of sea freight. Upon the broad assumption that all the manufacturing countries will have been similarly affected by the war, their relative positions as regards competition in the world&apos;s markets can be approximately gauged by a consideration of the estimated pre-war production costs of the various nitrogen compounds set out in the Tables of Costs in a previous section of this Report (Tables 35 and 36).Ammonium Sulphate.439. It appears that synthetic ammonium sulphate can probably be produced by the Haber iprocess in Germany at a cost of about  6 per metric ton, and can therefore be sold at a profit ior about  7 or  8 per ton f.o.b., equivalent to from  35 to  40 per metric ton of combined Jiitrogen. The pre war (average 1911-1913) market price of ammonium sulphate in the United Kingdom was  13&apos;6 per metric ton, or  66 per metric ton of combined nitrogen.
Although the by-product industry can always face the competition of synthetic products by raising the prices of coal gas, coke, benzol, tar, etc., to compensate for a fall in the price of sulphate, it is clear that severe competition resulting from the marketing of large supplies of synthetic sulphate might necessitate a reduction in the price of the by-product to the lowest figure hitherto recorded in the United Kingdom, namely,  7&apos; 38 per metric ton.Calcium Cyanamide.440. Where the cheapest water power is available, it appears that cyanamide can be made at a cost, at the factory, of about  4 per metric ton. This figure, however, probably applies to a few sites only, where the situation in respect of supplies of limestone is very favourable, and where the best modern practice is employed. In most cases the cost is likely to amount to about  5 per metric ton, and to this there must be added the cost of the after-treatment for rendering the raw product suitable for manurial puposes, and the cost of packing, amounting in all to about  0&apos;75, thus bringing the total factory costs to  5 &quot;75 per metric ton, or about  29 per metric ton of combined nitrogen. Even when further allowances are made for profit, for the cost of marketing, and for the relative value of the product as a fertiliser, it still appears that nitrolim wall remain one&apos;of the cheapest forms of combined nitrogen, and will compete with ammonium sulphate.Chile Nitrate.441. Apart from other factors, the shortage of shipping after the war and the geographical situation of Chile are likely to constitute serious handicaps to the nitrate industry. In addition, there is the prospect that Chile nitrate, which stood at about  67 per metric ton of combined nitrogen before the war, will have to face the competition of increasing quantities of ammonia nitrogen and cyanamide nitrogen which may be marketed at prices of the order of  35 to  40 per metric ton. In these circumstances there is no doubt that the price of nitrate nitrogen would be influenced. It has already been shown that improved methods of extraction coupled with a return to normal rates of freight and a very substantial reduction in the Chilean export duty might enable the producers to market the nitrate in Europe in the future for  8 per long ton, or even at the &quot; lowest possible &quot; figure of  7 per long ton, equivalent respectively to about  50 and  44 per metric ton of combined nitrogen. Reductions to this extent, although representing a substantial loss of revenue to the Chilean Government and a greatly diminished return upon the capital invested in the industry, would not do more than place Chile nitrate upon a parity with the cheapest synthetic fertilisers. These considerations indicate that the Chilean industry is likely to be affected to a substantial degree in the future by the further development of synthetic processes.Nitric Acid.442. The cost of manufacturing concentrated nitric acid by the retort process under British conditions before the war amounted to  22&apos; 3 per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) whereas the estimated cost by the oxidation of cheap ammonia is only  10 to  12 per metric ton. &apos; Even with by-product ammonia, charged at its full pre-war market price, the oxidation process still appears to show a saving of about  2 per metric ton. There is the prospect that the process will eventually supersede the retort process, especially in view of the suitability of ammonia oxidation plants for the manufacture of ammonium nitrate. In the event of the post-war demand for nitric acid proving sufficiently large to attract external producers, the Norwegian arc process industry with its cheap water power will be the strongest competitor, with a production cost, at the factory, of from  6&apos; 7 to  8&apos; 2 per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.). It is true that the transport of strong nitric acid presents difficulties and danger, but the problem was in process of being solved prior to the war.Manufactured Nitrates.i 443. With regard to ammonium nitrate, the recent developments in the manufacture of ammonia from cyanamide have provided the Norwegian companies with a cheap source of ammonia upon the spot.   The low cost of nitric acid by the arc process should enable thecompanies to manufacture the nitrate at a cost, at the factory, of perhaps  28 to  32 permetric ton of combined nitrogen, which is on a parity with the costs incurred in mailing the product by the oxidation of the cheapest synthetic ammonia.v.444. In the case of nitrate of lime and sodium nitrate, the arc process with cheap water power is the only one that shows sufficient commercial margin to enable the synthetic product to face a substantial fall in the pre-war price of Chile nitrate. Although the ammonia oxidation process lends itself to the production of these nitrates at a reasonably low cost if sufficiently cheap ammonia is available, the economic position of the process, would be materially affected if the market price of Chile nitrate fell below its pre-war value.
OBSERVATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS.445. Notwithstanding the uncertain elements in the post-war position of the nitrogen industries, a careful review of the possibilities leads to the following conclusions : (a) The post-war supply of fixed nitrogen potentially available for the world&apos;s requirements is likely to be of the order of 1,000,000 metric tons or over per annum, an increase of from 30 to 40 per cent, on the pre-war production.(&amp;) In spite of the great extension of the nitrogen fixation industry during the war, the total increase in the world&apos;s output of combined nitrogen does not appear to exceed the figure that would have resulted from a continuation, under normal conditions, of the rate of growth in consumption prevailing in the pre-war period.(c) The demand for nitrogenous fertilisers is already considerably in excess of the pre-war consumption, and in the event of a fall in the price of fixed nitrogen to, say,  40 or  45 per metric ton, the Committee is of the opinion that the demand would increase at an even greater rate than hitherto.(cl) There will probably be ample scope in the post-war markets for all forms of nitrogenous fertilisers, both non-synthetic and synthetic.(e) The industrial demand for nitric nitrogen is likely to be met in the future by means of synthetic processes, which show to considerable advantage as compared with the Chile nitrate retort process.(/) As a result of the modifications due to the war, the Chile nitrate industry may account for about 41 per cent., the by-product ammonia industry for about 30 percent., and the synthetic industries for about 28 per cent, of the post-war supplies of combined nitrogen.(g) The marketing of large quantities of synthetic ammonium sulphate and calcium cyanamide consequent on the further development of the Haber and cyanamide processes, must influence the future price of combined nitrogen and may even control it.\h) The producers of combined nitrogen may eventually have to face a competitive price of perhaps  7 to  8 per metric ton for ammonium sulphate and  6 to  7 per metric ton for cyanamide.(i) The Chile nitrate industry, in order to hold its position against the cheapest synthetic fertilisers, may be faced with the necessity of making substantial reductions in price, perhaps to a figure of  8 per ton or even less.(j) With regard to nitrate fertilisers, the Chilean industry will probably be able to hold the market against the synthetic processes. The economic and financial position of Germany during the years succeeding the war may, however, induce that country to resort to the manufacture of synthetic nitrates, so that the possibility of the partial or total loss of the German market must be contemplated.(k) The by-product ammonia industry, although capable of meeting the competition of synthetic products by raising, within limits, the prices of coal gas, coke, benzol, tar, etc., to compensate for a fall in the price of sulphate, may be faced with the necessity for making substantial reductions in the price of sulphate, perhaps to a figure approximating to the lowest market price hitherto recorded in the United Kingdom.(I) The relative positions of the different countries as outlined above may be modified to an important degree by the cost of labour and materials, and more particularly by the world shortage of shipping. As long as the shortage exists, it will operate to the substantial advantage of producers who have a local market available.X. THE POST-WAR REQUIREMENTS OF THE UNITED KINGDOM.446. Although the requirements for munitions^have overshadowed all other demands for combined nitrogen during the war, developments of considerable importance have been occurring in agriculture and industry in the United Kingdom. The munitions industry will at once fall away from its present scale at the termination of the war, and with a satisfactory peace, the future military- requirements for fixed nitrogen may not be very largely in exjcess of the pre-war needs. On the&apos; other hand, the new demands that have arisen are of a less transitory character, and under favourable circumstances offer the prospect of still further development and a large permanent increase in the consumption of fixed nitrogen in this country.447. It is a matter of considerable,importance to arrive at conclusions as to the probable post-war demand for fixed nitrogen for agriculture, industry, and the export trade, and also .the extent to which such requirements can be met from the resources of the country. As will be recognised, it is only possible to deal with the questions at issue on broad lines on account of the uncertain elements in the post-war situation. It has been assumed in the review given below that the military demand for fixed nitrogen will be of approximately the same order as before the war.
1    AGRICULTURAL REQUIREMENTS.448. The area under cultivation in Great Britain before the war was 31,900,000 acres, of which more than two-thirds were under grass, and thus only received a fraction of tho manure given to the arable land. According to an estimate given by Sir Thomas Middleton (The Recent Development of German Agriculture, Cd. 8305, 1916), in which the total consumption of artificial nitrogenous manures is expressed in terms of ammonium sulphate (20&apos;5 per cent. N.), the weight of nitrogen applied annually per 100 acres of cultivated land in Great Britain amounted to 0&apos; 48 ton of sulphate. In contrasting the position of the United Kingdom with that of Germany, where less than one-third of the cultivated land was under grass, the German consumption of artificial nitrogenous fertilisers is estimated at 0&apos; 87 ton of sulphate (20&apos;5 per cent. N.) per annum per 100 acres of cultivated land. It is pointed out, however, that the British farmer used 11&apos; 5 tons of imported feeding stuffs per 100 acres, as compared with 8&apos;7 tons in Germany, and that, theoretically, this ought largely to have compensated for the smaller amount of nitrogen and phosphates applied direct as manures in this country. On account of the heavy losses which occur in farmyard manure through improper storage, &quot; the actual results obtained from the larger consumption of feeding stuffs are certainly very much less than those from the direct application of the fertilisers,&quot; (Cd. 8305, p. 37).449. The balance sheet prepared by the Committee for the period 1911-13 (Table 20, and Appendix II.) shows that in the United Kingdom the average annual consumption of artificial nitrogenous manures in the form of Chile nitrate, ammonium sulphate, calcium cyanamide and nitrate of lime amounted to about 25,000 metric tons of fixed nitrogen. To this figure there must be aTlded the nitrogen equivalent of other artificial fertilisers, such as guanos, fish and meat meals, bones, wool and other wastes, estimated .at from 3,000 to 4,000 tons of combined nitrogen, thus making a total consumption of about 29,000 metric tons of fixed nitrogen per annum in the form of artificial nitrogenous manures.450. The total area under cultivation in 1913 in the whole of the United Kingdom was about 46,740,000 acres, so that on the basis of the above figures the annual consumption of artificial nitrogenous manures represented the equivalent of 0&apos;30 metric ton of ammonium sulphate (20&apos;5 per cent. N.) per 100 acres, corresponding to the application of 3 kg. (6&apos;6 lb.) of sulphate or 0&apos;62 kg. (.! &quot;37 lb.) of fixed nitrogen per acre of total, land under cultivation. When considered in relation to the total arable land in the United Kingdom in 1913, namely, about 19,430,000 acres, the annual consumption represented the equivalent of about 0&apos;73 metric ton of sulphate (20&apos;5 per cent. N.) per 100 acres of arable land, corresponding to the application of about 7&apos; 3 kg. (16 lb.) of sulphate or about 1&apos; 5 kg. (3&apos; 3 lb.) of fixed nitrogen per acre. It must be remembered, however, that enormous quantities of farmyard manure, representing perhaps a further 200,000 tons of combined nitrogen, were also used.451. If the agricultural situation in the United Kingdom became comparable with the pre-war position in Germany and led to a similar liberal use of artificial nitrogenous fertilisers, the increase in the annual demand for fixed nitrogen would represent the equivalent of about 280,000 metric tons of ammonium sulphate (20&apos;5 per cent. N.),or nearly 58,000 metric tons of combined nitrogen. It is interesting to note that figures of the same order have been put forward by Sir Charles Fielding in connection with a scheme for rendering the United Kingdom entirely self-supporting in all food supplies (Report of a Departmental Committee on The Post-War Position of tlie Sulphuric Acid and Fertiliser Trades, Cd. 8994, 1918). According to his &quot;Agricola Scheme,&quot; which involves the cultivation of a total area of 48,000,000 acres and a readjustment of the acreage devoted to different crops and to grass, the additional quantity of nitrogenous fertilisers needed for the extra 6,000,000 acres allocated to wheat is placed at 300,000 tons of ammonium sulphate or Chile nitrate per annum.452. The exigencies of the war situation have resulted in a remarkable development in agriculture in this country, and the area under *he plough is already about 4,000,000 acres in excess of the pre-war figures. As an outcome of the vigorous policy that has been pursued, of the keenness of the farmers, and of their growing appreciation of the value of nitrogenous fertilisers, the demand for the latter lias already become very large, and there is every prospect of a further increase in the immediate future. Under war conditions, with available supplies of Chile nitrate ear-marked for explosives purposes, this demand has had to be met as far as possible by the ammonium sulphate industry. The by-product industry, however, lias been required to contribute substantial quantities of ammonia to the production of ex-plosives, and although the exportation ofv ammonium sulphate has practically ceased, the recent demands of agriculture have been in excess of the available output of sulphate. The Committee has been informed by the Food Production Department of the Board of. Agri-culture and Fisheries that the sales of ammonium sulphate during the season June 1917 to May 1918 amounted to about 233,000 tons, and that a further quantity of about 60,000 tons could have been disposed of to the farmers had supplies been forthcoming. Although it is difficult to frame a close estimate of the requirements for the season 1918-1919, it was con-sidered by that Department that a supply of nitrogenous fertilisers equivalent to from 300,000 to 320,000 tons of ammonium sulphate would be needed to maintain the existing rates oJ;
manuring the crops of the United Kingdom ; the quantity actually available, however, might fall short of these figures by from 50,000 to 60,00&apos;) tons.453. Owing to the Avar policy of food production, the agricultural demand for fixed nitrogen in the form, of ammonium sulphate and nitrates has thus attained at tho present time a figure of the order of 60,000 tons per annum, as compared with a pre-war consumption of 25,000 tons.Influence of Agricultural Policy in the Future.454. The problem of estimating the future consumption of nitrogenous fertilisers is beset with many difficulties, the outstanding uncertainty arising from the fact that the post-Avar agricultural policy of the United Kingdom has not yet been definitely determined. If the efforts of the past two years come to be regarded as a transitory phase of the Avar situation, and no steps are taken on the conclusion of peace to preserve the continuity of the develop-ments that have been accomplished, the position of agriculture might at no distant date revert to its pre-war level, and the consumption of nitrogenous fertilisers would then be no greater than heretofore. On the other hand, the policy adopted may be directed towards the main-tenance of the acreage at present under the plough or even towards the further development of the agricultural resources of the United Kingdom. In this connection, recommendations of a far-reaching character have already been made by the Agricultural Policy Sub-Committee of the Reconstruction Committee in a Report (Cd. 9079,1918) Avhich states, inter alia, that: We have believed that elementary considerations of national insurance demand that this country should become self-supporting in the matter of foodstuffs in the event of any future emergency, and . we have shown how this can be done (p. 89).With regard to the consequent need of artificial manures,*it is pointed out in that Report that: With the largely increased area under cultivation which the adoption of our recommendations would bring about, the demand for nitrogenous manures in the future will be greater than anything we have experienced hitherto, and much larger quantities will have to be -used if we -are to secure from the soil the yield in produce that we look for. All sources of nitrogen supply must be tapped to the fullest extent, and we hope that the resources at our command in the matter of nitrogenous fertilisers may be so developed as to render this country, in the event of a future war, independent of foreign supplies. It is only in recent years that means have been discovered for combining atmospheric nitrogen in a form suitable for application as manure, but experience in other countries has amply demonstrated the possibilities that lie in this direction. We are gratified to learn that a special Committee appointed by the Government has already been dealing exhaustively with the question of nitrogen products, and is likely to make such recommendations as will, if adopted, go far to solve the problem of the supply of nitrogen in this country (Appendix XIII., p. 125).455. When, account is taken of the existing demand for nitrogenous fertilisers, it is apparent that a policy which eventually led to the United Kingdom becoming self-supporting in foodstuffs, and independent of foreign supplies of fertilisers, avouIcI involve the home pro-duction of extremely large quantities of fixed nitrogen. The question as to Avhether the existing resources of the country could meet all future demands renders it necessary to attempt to estimate the potential, needs of agriculture, and this can only be done upon the basis of specific circumstances. It has therefore been assumed that the present scale of food production Avill be at least maintained after the Avar, and consideration is given below to some of the factors that will determine the post-Avar demand for nitrogenous manures.456. In the first place, the quantity of fixed nitrogen applied to the a,rable land will certainly be much larger than under pre-Avar conditions. Although the application at the present time is probably at least double the pre-war figure, there- is scope with the prevailing high prices of farm produce for a still higher consumption before the point is reached at Avhich the farmer Avould cease to obtain a paying return. In the next place, there is the prospect of a large increase in the use of nitrogenous fertilisers upon grass land. It was pointed out in evidence given before the Committee that the diminished acreage of permanent pasture conse-quent upon the ploughing up of grass land rendered the question of grasses a most important one, and that if indigenous grasses were improved by breeding in the same way as other crops, the pastures Avould be well Avorth fertilising to a greater extent. The same Avitness also referred to the practice, under existing conditions, of utilising certain organic nitrogen corn-pounds as feeding stuffs for cattle and poultry instead of as manure, as hitherto, and pointed out that the tendency for their use in this connection to persist would lead to an increase in the demand for inorganic fertilisers. Economic factors, such as the price obtainable for farm produce and the rate of wages in agriculture, will also exert an influence upon the demand for manures, and in the latter connection it has been stated by Sir T. H. Middleton (Cd. 8994, previously quoted) that:  *    . .If steps are taken to secure a definite area of arable land, the higher cost of labour will also tend to increase the use of manures, for in many cases it would only be possible to pay the increased wages if considerably higher crops are grown than were produced before the war (p. 13).457. Other things being equal, hoAvever, the preponderating factor.in determining the future consumption of combined nitrogen in agriculture will be the price at Avhich it is procurable. The possibilities in this direction due to the development of the synthetic nitrogen
industry have already been indicated, and in the event of adequate supplies of fixed nitrogen being forthcoming at a price showing even a moderate reduction upon the pre-war figure, the Committee is strongly of the opinion that there will be a very substantial increase in thex consumption. If, however, the price of nitrogen remains at the level of the present controlled price of ammonium sulphate, the deinalid is likely to be largely determined by factors such as the prices obtainable for agricultural produce, and .there is no certainty that the consumption of fixed nitrogen will continue on the existing scale when the stimulus of war necessity has passed. If higher prices for fertilisers have to be contemplated, the demand for combined nitrogen may be seriously affected.Estimated Post-War Requirements for Agriculture.458. A tentative estimate has been prepared by.a member of the Committee showing the distribution of crops and the consumption of artificial nitrogenous manures that might be anticipated under post-war conditions if steps are taken to maintain the present acreage of land, under the plough. The estimate takes account of the large quantity of farmyard manure utilised in the United Kingdom, and assumes, in general, a dressing of artificial manure equivalent to 1 cwt. of ammonium sulphate per acre for cereals and roots. This is considered to be as much as most farmers would give in view of the amount of farmyard manure used. A much smaller dressing per acre has been assumed in the case of grass land.Table 53.-ESTIMATED POST-WAR CONSUMPTION OP ARTIFICIAL NITROGENOUSFERTILISERS.	Cultivated Area.		Estimated AnnualChops.

J. Russell, Director ot Rothamsted Experimental Station.459. From a general consideration of the prospects under a progressive agricultural policy and of the factors previously enumerated, the above estimate points to the conclusion that the future consumption of artificial nitrogenous fertilisers in the United Kingdom might amount to the equivalent of about half a million tons of ammonium sulphate per annum, or 100,000 tons of fixed nitrogen, as compared with an existing demand for about 60,000 tons and a pre-war consumption of only 25,000 tons. *460. It must be pointed out that it would be impracticable to rely exclusively upon any one form of nitrogen compound for fertilising purposes. Nitrates are indispensable in certain agricultural conditions, while ammonium sulphate or calcium cyanamide (nitrolim) serves quite well in others. Before the war farmers used approximately as much Chile nitrate as ammonium sulphate, but during the war period they have been obliged, for reasons previously stated, to rely almost exclusively upon the latter. This course, however,. is attended with disadvantages, and would not be adopted voluntarily in normal times. Tfiere will thus be a partial reversion to the use of nitrate fertilisers when the latter again become available, but it is impossible to predict wdiether they will be employed to the same relative extent as formerly. There has always been a certain amount of prejudice against the use of ammonium sulphate, but the Committee has been informed that this has been partially overcome as the result of the experience of the last three years. The prejudice has not been without foundation, and has been caused in part by the impure character of the sulphate and by its acidity, the latter having a deleterious action in the soil and a destructive effect upon the bags in which the product, is marketed. With further improvements in these directions it would not be unreasonable to anticipate an extended demand for ammonium sulphate, although, by reason of its slower action, this fertiliser could not be expected to displace Chile nitrate.INDUSTRIAL REQUIREMENTS.461. In dealing with the pre-war position of the United Kingdom, it was shown that,the industrialrequirements for combined nitrogen were comparatively small. The total amount of fixed nitrogen used in industry and in the manufacture of products for export (excepting
ammonium sulphate), even with the inclusion of the quantities remaining unaccounted for in the nitrogen balance sheet (Appendix II.), was barely 20,000 metric tons per annum, in the form of about 9,000 metric tons of ammonia nitrogen and 11,000 metric tons of nitrate nitrogen. Of the nitrate nitrogen consumed in industry, about 9,000 metric tons was in the form of Chile nitrate, and about 2,000 metric tons in the form of potassium and ammonium nitrates, the principal consumers of the former product being the nitric acid and sulphuric acid industries.462. Ammonia nitrogen was principally utilised in the ammonium salt industry and in the manufacture of cyanides, and the requirements for these purposes appear to be on the increase. Efforts may also be made to promote the more extensive use of ammonium nitrate as an ingredient of mining explosives, owing to the experience gained with the product during the war period. It would be sanguine to expect, however, that increasing demands in these directions could result, say, in the doubling of the pre-war figure for several years to come.The Demand for Nitric Acid.463. It is difficult to forecast the future requirements for nitrate nitrogen, but in evidence given before the Committee the view has been expressed that there will be a large demand for nitric acid in the synthetic dye industry. As far as can be ascertained, the manufacture of nitric acid accounted for about 3,200 metric tons of combined nitrogen under pre-war con-ditions, and although definite figures are not available, it is certain that only a small proportion of this quantity was utilised in the dye industry. Statistics furnished by the Explosives Department show that the consumption of nitric acid (calculated as 100 per cent.) for the manufacture of dyes and intermediate products increased to about 400 tons per month by the middle of 1916 and has since risen to somewhat more than 600 tons per month. It is con-sidered that a generous estimate of the future consumption would be about 1,200 tons of nitric acid per month, equivalent to about 3,250 metric tons of combined nitrogen per annum. On this basis, the dye industry might require as m*ch nitric acid as was consumed for all purposes prior to the war, but even then would still remain a relatively small consumer of fixed nitrogen. When allowance is made for a probable increase in the requirements of other industries, such as the manufacture of mining explosives, the evidence available can only be said to foreshadow an eventual demand for nitric nitrogen of the. order of 8,000 metric tons per annum, or two and a half times the pre-war consumption.464. It is clear that the increased demand which will exist at the termination of the war cannot be expected to provide a use for more than a very small proportion of the retort process plants erected to meet the large war demand for nitric acid. Moreover, when regard is had to the substantial economies shown by the synthetic nitric acid processes as compared with the retort process, it would be unwise to count upon more than the temporary employment of the war plants for which a use may be found.Nitrogen required in Sulphuric Acid Manufacture.465. The second largest consumer of nitrate nitrogen under pre-war conditions was the sulphuric acid industry, which utilised about 2,900 metric tons for providing the oxides of nitrogen required in the chamber process. The effect of the war upon this industry and its position under post-war conditions have been dealt with by another Committee in a recent report (Report of a Departmental Committee on the Post-War Position of the Sulphuric Acid and Fertiliser Trades, Cd. 8994, 1918), which states :-Allowing for a post-war reversion to working normal conditions, the Committee anticipate that the output, in terms of chamber acid, will be about 60 per cent, in excess of the pre-war production, and of that 60 per cent., rather less than one-half represents the productive capacity of plant either owned or leased by the Ministry of Munitions, practically all of which is of the contact type (p. 4).The report also deals with the development of the zinc industry during the Avar, and with the question of utilising the sulphurous gases obtained in roasting zinc concentrates, pointing out that: These gases should be converted into sulphuric acid, and so soon as the roasting of these ores can\ be undertaken, a production equal to about one-fifth of the expected gross surplus will result. This production (from Australian, Burmese, and native concentrates) will only be an addition to the surplus in so far as new acid plant is erected for the purpose of dealing with the gases (p. 5). iIt thus appears that the actual or potential production of chamber acid under post-war conditions may represent an increase of some 30 to 40 per cent, upon the pre-war output. If a market were available for the total production, the amount of nitrate nitrogen required in the chamber process would be increased to about 3,800 or 4,000 metric tons per annum.466. When account is taken of the requirements of other industries, it is probable that an annual consumption of 20,000 metric tons of nitrate and nitric nitrogen would represent a liberal estimate of the demand likely to arise within several years after the war.
EXPORT TRADE.467. The export trade of the United Kingdom in ammonium sulphate under pre-war conditions was larger than that of any other country in the world, and accounted for the disposal of about 61,000 metric tons of ammonia nitrogen per annum, or about three-quarters of the total home production (average 1911-13). The value of the export trade, upon the basis of the market price of ammonium sulphate, amounted to about  4,000,000 per annum. The trade was maintained during the years 1914-16, but practically ceased in 1917 on account . of the increasing home demand for munitions and fertilisers.468. The question as to whether or not this country can maintain as large an export trade as formerly depends upon several factors, such as the prospective demand in the pre-war markets, the possibility of opening up new markets, and the ability to compete upon advantageous terms with other countries which are in a position to export ammonium sulphate.469. The war developments in the United States and Japan, two of the largest customers before the war, have led to rapid progress in the output of by-product ammonia and in the manufacture of synthetic nitrogen compounds, so that the total or partial loss of two important markets has to be faced. There is also the prospect that an effort will be made by Germany to capture the markets in neutral and other countries, especially those which are readily accessible by railway. In evidence given before the Committee, it was stated that develop-ments of such a character would tend to bring about a falling-off in the export trade after the war ; that any increased consumption in the United Kingdom would probably only compensate for the loss of external markets; and that when allowance was made for the home demand in agriculture there would remain an adequate surplus for export purposes. The same witness contrasted the world&apos;s pre-war production of ammonium sulphate and the potential output after the war, and expressed the view that unless the conditions showed a radical alteration from those prevailing prior to the war, everything pointed to there being a large surplus. A different view was held by another witness, who considered that the export trade Avould increase, because countries which had been unable to obtain supplies of fertilisers during the war would appreciate their value to a greater extent than formerly and would use them on a more systematic scale, especially if adequate supplies were available at a reasonable price.470. In addition to the pre-war consumers, tropical and sub-tropical countries, such as India, Africa, and South America, constitute potential markets for large quantities of ammonium sulphate. The necessity for proper fertilisation is being recognised to an increasing extent in these countries, which comprise some of the most conservative agricultural nations, and if advantage is taken of this fact there is the prospect of a valuable accession to the export trade of the United Kingdom in the near future. It is difficult, however, to estimate the extent to which these markets could be counted upon immediately after the termination of the war.471. The position of the United Kingdom in foreign markets can only be maintained and extended by resorting to every possible method of cheapening the production of ammonia fertilisers, and by cheap transport. It has already been stated that the costs incurred in the by-product industry merely for fixing the ammonia and preparing a solid product for the market amount to from  2&apos;5 to  3 per long ton of sulphate, according to the system of recovery adopted, and these figures only hold when cheap sulphuric acid is available and the manufacture of the sulphate is carried out on a large scale. The great importance of cheap acid can be judged by the fact that about one ton of chamber sulphuric acid is required for every ton of sulphate produced.472. The post-war position of the sulphuric acid industry and its hearing upon the fertiliser trades have already been investigated and reported upon by a Departmental Committee (Cd. 8994, 1918, previously quoted), and it appears from the report of that Committee that the main prospects of a substantially cheaper sulphuric acid are dependent upon the establishment of the zinc industry in this country. The policy advocated in connection with this industry has an important bearing upon the question of cheap ammonium sulphate and must therefore be briefly indicated. In the first place, the Departmental Committee states that: We find a strong feeling throughout these trades (i.e., thej sulphuric acid and fertiliser trades) that the production of sulphuric acid as a by-product in the roasting of concentrates is likely, unless carefully handled, to have serious consequences to established firms, who will have to face competition from producers who will have to sell or otherwise dispose of their sulphuric acid irrespective of financial return owing to its unavoidable production; these consequences will be the more serious in view of the guaranteed price for spelter (p. 8).The acid produced from these ores will amount to about one-fifth of the gross surplus production. The Committee is of opinion that every effort should be made to link up new zinc roasting plant with existing and efficient acid plant so as to avoid the needless erection of furthur surplus plant (p. 9).The report proceeds to compare the merits of zinc sulphide and pyrites from the standpoint of the acid maker, and points out that, fundamentally, zinc sulphide is by no means a desirable source of sulphur, that fuel is required to complete its combustion, that serious mechanical difficulties are encountered in roasting it, and that the requirements of the spelterU  6619 q
manufacturer in regard to complete burning of the sulphur are difficult to meet.   It is then stated that These difficulties are recognised, and it is generally agreed that in order to place him on a com-petitive equality with a pyrites user, an acid manufacturer should he paid a burning allowance in recompense for the cost of roasting the concentrates in addition to receiving the sulphur gases free of charge for conversion into sulphuric acid (p. 9).It is considered, however, that The greater the extent to which concentrates are roasted by existing acid makers, the less will be the damage done to the acid and fertiliser trades (p. 9).Reference is subsequently made to the influence of the cost of sulphuric acid in industry in the following terms : Although the majority of manufacturing trades are dependent on supplies of sulphuric acid, in relatively few of these is the cost of acid an important factor, since the charge for acid in relation to the total cost of the manufactured goods is often very small or negligible. This applies to the whole group of engineering trades, to the textile trades, to leather, paint, and several smaller industries. In the case of the manufacture of artificial fertilisers, the charge for acid is a relatively large proportion of the total cost of production, and in the manufacture of superphosphates, where competition is keen, the cost of acid is a factor of supreme importance. While, therefore, we consider that efficient working and low cost of production is essential throughout the&apos;industry, it becomes a manufacturing problem of even greater importance when associated with the production of superphosphate (p. 10).Finally, recommendations are made &quot; for providing an outlet for and generally dealing with the surplus sulphuric acid which may be expected over pre-war productions,&quot; and &quot;for the relief of acid and fertiliser makers from the competitive effect of surplus acid.&quot; In respect of the zinc industry, it is recommended that a representative Joint Committee should be formed &quot; To suggest means whereby the erection of new acid works to deal with the gases from zinc concentrates can be avoided.&quot;473. The steps, advocated in the above report aim at a minimum disturbance of the acid and fertiliser trades at the termination of the war, but it is clearly demonstrated that the interests of the producers and consumers in respect of the cost of acid are conflicting. It is also shown that there is a conflict of interests between the existing makers of.sulphuric acid and an industry capable of producing large quantities of cheap by-product acid. There is no question that the fertiliser trades, which formerly consumed about 60 per cent, of the total production of acid, must be supplied with the cheapest possible acid if the large pre-war exports are to be maintained, let alone increased. It is, in fact, pointed out in the above report (p. 4), that the decline in the British exports of superphosphate has been partly due to the competition of continental countries where cheap by-product acid from zinc manufacture has been available.474. The national interests demand that an abundant and cheap supply of fertilisers should be available, not only for the agricultural requirements of the United Kingdom, but also for export to other food-producing countries. This end, however, cannot be served by measures which limit the production of cheap by-product acid that has already conferred advantages upon other countries. Failing a cheaper acid from existing or potential sources, a solution to the problem of reducing the cost of fixing ammonia must be sought in methods of the kind referred to later, which avoid the use of sulphuric acid.475. After a full consideration of the future prospects of the export trade in nitrogenous fertilisers in the light of the evidence that has been given, the Committee is of the opinion that the outlook is undoubtedly favourable.    The diversion of a large proportion of the world&apos;s production of fixed nitrogen to munitions for a period of several years has been to the great detriment of the world&apos;s supply of food, and in many countries the scale of subsistence has been reduced far below the pre-war level.   The vital importance of nitrogenous manures, has received almost universal recognition, and in view of the leeway to be made up, there is certain to be a large increase in the consumption in the near future, especially in countries that have been unable to obtain supplies of ammonium sulphate from Great Britain or elsewhere during the war.   The conditions will undoubtedly be unsetttled for a time on the conclusion of peace, but, in the judgment of the Committee, the demand in external markets will be more than adequate for absorbing ammonium sulphate on the pre-war scale of exportation.   The extent to which the markets are retained by British producers, however, must depend upon their ability to compete on favourable terms with other exporting countries.SUMMARY OF POST-WAR REQUIREMENTS.476. Upon the basis of the considerations just presented, an attempt is made in the estimate set out in Table 54 to indicate the probable order of the post-war demand for fixed nitrogen in agriculture, in industry, and for export. The estimated visible demand on the conclusion of peace and the estimated possible demand in the near future are set out in separate columns, the corresponding figures for the pre-war period (average 1911-13) being given for comparison. It is specially to be noted that the future requirements for munitions have beer taken as on a parity with the pre-war demand, and are included in the table under
the heading &quot; Industry.&quot; In the event of it becoming necessary to maintain armaments upon a larger scale than formerly, the estimates would have to be increased to provide for the extra military requirements.Table 54-ESTIMATED POST-WAR REQUIREMENTS OP THE UNITED KINGDOM.

It has already been pointed out that the requirements of agriculture necessitate a supply of different forms of combined nitrogen, such as nitrate nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, and cyanamide nitrogen. The Committee has been informed by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries that as each of these forms of combined nitrogen has special value in particular circumstances, a supply of all of them is desirable. There is no definite basis upon which the relative demands for the three forms of combined nitrogen can be estimated, and the allocation embodied in Table 55, which is a re-statement of the previous one, is merely put forward as suggestive of the possibilities.Table 55.-ESTIMATED POST-WAR REQUIREMENTS.&quot; Possible &quot; allocation of Fixed Nitrogen.Form of Combined Nitkogen and Use.

It may be recalled that the total output of the by-product ammonia industry in the United Kingdom amounted to about 82,000 metric tons of fixed nitrogen per annum in the pre-war period (average 1911-13) and attained a figure of 94,000 metric tons in 1917.13JG 2
OBSERVATIONS.478. It has been stated by the Agricultural Policy Sub-Coinniittee of the Reconstruction Committee (Cd. 9079, previously quoted] that:.....We hope that the resources at our command in the matter of nitrogenous fertilisers maybe so developed as to render this country, in the event of a future war, independent of foreign supplies,   (p. 125.)The United Kingdom has hitherto depended entirely upon imported products for all requirements in respect of nitrate, nitric, and cyanamide nitrogen, and a policy directed towards independence of foreign supplies from the point of view of national security would necessitate the home production of these forms of combined nitrogen. There is no question that the manufacture of cyanamide and nitric nitrogen could be established in, this country on a sound economic basis. The position in respect of nitrate nitrogen, however, is less certain from the economic standpoint. Given a sufficiently cheap supply of ammonia, it has been shown that synthetic nitrates could be produced by means of the ammonia oxidation process at costs which would probably enable the products to be marketed upon a parity with the pre-war price of Chile nitrate. A substantial fall in the price of nitrate would materially affect the economic position of the process, but even when account is taken of all these con-siderations, the over-riding importance of national security might require the manufacture of synthetic nitrates to be established in this country.479. Assuming that the oxidation of ammonia were resorted to as a method of obtaining the necessary nitric and nitrate nitrogen, the quantities of the latter specified in the second and third columns of Table 55 represent the equivalent of about 44,000 and 60,000 metric tons of ammonia nitrogen respectively. The total home production of ammonia nitrogen for meeting the estimated demands in the two cases would thus have to be of the order of 81,000 -f 44,000 = 125,000 metric tons, and 122,000 -f- 60,000 = 182,000 metric tons per annum. If the export trade in ammonium sulphate were completely abandoned and the product diverted to home requirements, the annual production of ammonia nitrogen in the cases under consideration would have to be of the order of 90,000 and 120,000 metric tons respectively.480. At the expense of the export trade, the maintenance of an annual home production equivalent to that in 1917 would therefore be sufficient for rendering the United Kingdom self-supporting to the extent of the estimated visible demand on the conclusion of peace. Upon the basis of the estimated possible demand in the near future, the production of ammonia nitrogen would have to be augmented to the extent of about 26,000 metric tons per annum and the calcium cyanamide process installed on a scale sufficient to produce a further 15,000 metric tons of fixed nitrogen in order to render the country independent of external supplies.481. It is important to remember that, in the circumstances indicated above, there would be no margin of productive capacity for meeting a war emergency demand. Although a large proportion of the fixed nitrogen used in industry could doubtless be diverted to military requirements, the experience of the war has demonstrated that it would be unsafe to face a future emergency without a substantial reserve of plant capacity. From this point of view, the maintenance of a large export trade in nitrogenous fertilisers would thus have to be an essential feature of post-war policy, since only in this manner could an economic use be found during peace time for an adequate reserve of plant.XI.-THE NITROGEN RESOURCES OF THE UNITED KINGDOM.482. The magnitude of the by-product ammonia industry in the United Kingdom has already been indicated in previous sections of the Report, and figures are given in Tables 18 and 48 (see pp. 20 and 77) for the total annual production of fixed nitrogen from this source from 1903 to 1917. It has also been shown that a policy of food production directed towards rendering the United Kingdom independent of imported nitrogenous fertilisers and coupled with the maintenance of a large export trade in ammonium sulphate, would necessitate the production of ammonia nitrogen on a much larger scale than hitherto in order to meet the estimated visible demand at the termination of the war and a possible greater demand in the near future.483. Practically the whole of the output of by-product nitrogen has been obtained in industries primarily engaged in the manufacture of coal gas, metallurgical coke, producer gas and shale oil. There are immense potential reserves of coal and shale in the United Kingdom, and, in addition, there are large reserves of other nitrogen-bearing materials which have hitherto remained untapped, the1&quot; most important of these being peat and sewage.484. The questions thus arise: Are the home resources adequate for meeting all future demands for combined nitrogen, and, if so, to what extent is it feasible or economical to develop them in our present state of knowledge ? In order to answer these questions it is necessary to consider on broad lines the magnitude and general character of the nitrogen
resources of the United Kingdom, the present scale and future prospects of the principal by-product ammonia industries, and the possibilities attaching to the introduction and successful development of other methods of utilising nitrogenous materials for ammonia recovery. The Committee has investigated these matters in considerable detail, and a complete digest of the more important evidence is given in the form of Appendices to the Report. (Appendices III. and IF. and Appendix V., Sections XIII. and XIV.) The principal points emerging from this investigation, and the Committee&apos;s observations and conclusions thereon are summarised below.NITROGEN FROM COAL.485. It is estimated that the reserves of available coal in the United Kingdom within 4,000 feet of the surface, after making allowance for &quot;pit wastage&quot; to the extent of 15 per cent., amount to a total of 168,000 million tons (Cd. 8880, previously quoted).486. The annual output of coal during the period 1911-13 and in 1.917, the corre-sponding home consumption for all purposes, and the proportion of the latter which was utilised in the principal industries responsible for the home production of ammonia nitrogen are indicated in Table 56.Table 56.-COAL CONSUMED IN PRINCIPAL BY-PRODUCT AMMONIA INDUSTRIES.(In relation to total output and total home consumption.).

The principal points disclosed by the above table and by the additional data given in an Appendix (Appendix III.) are as follows: (o) The total output of coal in 1917 was nearly 10 per cent, less than the average (1911-13) output before the war.(6) The home consumption for all purposes in 1917 was over 9 per cent, greater than the average pre-war consumption.(c) The three principal by-product ammonia industries accounted for about 40&apos;2 million tons of coal in 1917 as compared with about 36 million tons per annum in the pre-war period (average 1911-13), an increase of about 11&apos;8 per cent.(d) The three industries in question accounted for about 20 per cent, of the total home consumption of coal in 1917 and in the pre-war period also.(e) On an average, gasworks carbonised about 17&apos; 1 miDion tons of coal per annum before the war, as contrasted with 18&apos;8 million tons in 1917, the latter representing an advance of 10 per cent, on the former figure,(/) Coke-oven works carbonised about 18&apos; 1 million tons of coal per annum in the pre-war period (average 1911-13), and about 20&apos;5 million tons in 1917, the latter representing an increase of over 13 per cent, on the former figure.(g) The quantity of coal gasified in recovery producers before the war averaged 776,000 tons per annum. In 1917, the quantity amounted to 941,000 tons, an increase of over 21 per cent.U  6619 ...... G 3
Definite statistics are not available for the quantities of raw coal consumed in blast furnaces and at miscellaneous carbonising works where ammonia nitrogen is recovered. The quantities were probably small in comparison with the total consumption at gasworks and coke-oven works.488. If the average nitrogen content of all classes of coal is taken at an approximate figure of 1 &apos;2 per cent., the &quot;nitrogen value &quot; of the coal consumed annually in the United Kingdom is of the order of 2&apos;2 million tons, equivalent to about 11 million tons of ammonium sulphate. These figures, however, are not a true measure of the potential value of the coal, because it is only possible by processes already in operation to recover a proportion of the fixed nitrogen of coal in the form of ammonia or. ammonium sulphate. Tins proportion varies from 15 to 20 per cent, in the case of carbonisation at a high temperature, as at gasworks and coke-ovens, to a maximum of about 70 per cent, when coal is gasified in recovery producers.489. The quantities of ammonia nitrogen actually obtained from coal in the pre-war period (average 1911-13) and in 1917 are indicated in Table 57.Table 57.-PRODUCTION&quot; OF AMMONIA NITROGEN FROM COAL.1 / &quot;             .....

The most striking points revealed by an examination of the above table in the light of the figures previously given are : (a) From 84 to 86 per cent, of the total home production of ammonia nitrogen was derived from coal.. (b) The nitrogen recovered in the by-product industries specified above only represented some 3 or 4 per cent, of that contained in the coal consumed annually for all purposes, or about 16 per cent, of that contained in the coal used in the priricipaj. by-product ammonia industries. &quot; j(c) From 71 to 77 per cent, of the total output of ammonia nitrogen was con-tributed by two industries, namely, the coal gas and the metallurgical coke industries.(d) The increase in the recorded output of ammonia at gasworks in 1917 was smaller than might have been anticipated on the basis of the extra quantity of coal carbonised. .    ;(e) The increased production of ammonia from coke-oven works in 1917 was out of all proportion to the extra quantity of coal carbonised, being largely con-sequent upon the more extensive adoption of by-product recovery ovens and the rapid decline in the use of beehive ovens.(/) There was a decrease of about 5 per cent, in the output of ammonia at recovery producers in 1917, in spite of the fact that the quantity of coal gasified was over 21 per cent, greater than the average pre-war figure.  , . ; ,, 491. The detailed statistics for the different industries for 1917 and for the period 1911-13 show that the average yield of ammonia nitrogen per ton of coal utilised has increased in the case of coke-oven works but has exhibited a.small decline in the case of gasworks and a large decline in the case of recovery producer works (Appendix III.). There is little doubt that the total output of ammonia nitrogen from the quantities of coal used in the by-product ammonia industries in 1917 would, under normal conditions, have been sensibly greater tliah. the recorded output. Two important factors, however, have tended to decrease the output, namely:  . &apos; &apos;
(a) The inferior quality of the coal now obtainable by gasworks and producor-&apos; gas works as compared with the qualities available before the war.(6) The temporary restriction in the production of ammonium sulphate consequent upon the large demand for concentrated ammonia liquor for munitions, and the greater &apos; losses of ammonia attending the manufacture of the latter product especially under the&apos; conditions prevailing in war time.The difficulty of obtaining supplies of sulphuric acid has also been a contributory factor in some cases. - &apos;492. Having reviewed the general position in. respect of the recovery of nitrogen from coal,, it is now necessary to deal briefly with the individual industries from the point of view of the probable effect of the cessation of the present abnormal conditions. When supplies of coal of the requisite quality again become available and the manufacture of concentrated liquor gives place to the normal practice of, converting the ammonia into sulphate, improvements in average yields and a diminution in losses may be expected. These factors, together with the scale upon which the industries can be maintained in the future, will mainly determine the extent of the contributions of ammonia nitrogen likely to be obtained from coal in the period immediately following the termination of the war and in the near future.&apos; The Gas Industry.493. An analysis of the statistics of the gas industry indicates that the average yield&apos; of ammonia nitrogen per ton of coal carbonised ranged from about 22&apos; 7 lb. to 23 lb. of ammonium sulphate during the three years 1911-13. At a considerable number of small gasworks the ammonia removed from the gas was wasted, and it is considered on good authority that the recorded output was derived almost entirely from, authorised undertakings. Upon this basis, the average yield per ton of coal was practically constant at 24 lb. of ammonium sulphate during the three years before the war (Appendix III.). The output of ammonia nitrogen in 1917 represents an average yield of about 22 &quot;4 lb. of sulphate per ton of total coal carbonised. By the restoration of the average yield to the pre-war level of 22*7 lb., the gas industry, if maintained at its present scale&quot; would thus be able to furnish an extra 2,400 tons of ammonium sulphate per annum.494. There were considerable variations in the results obtained even among the principal works contributing the bulk of the output. For example, the yields obtained in 1913 at 28 of the principal gasworks in the United Kingdom, expressed as gallons of ammonia liquor of 10-oz. strength (2&apos; 17 per cent. NH3) per ton of coal carbonised, were as follows:-30 gals, and over at 11 works; from 25 to less than 30 gals, at 12 works ; and less than 25 gals, at 5 works. If the general average for all the larger works could be raised by improvements in existing practice directed towards the avoidance of losses, and it is considered on good authority that this could be done, a sensible addition might be made to the home production of fixed nitrogen. Assuming that the average yield per ton of coal carbonised throughout the industry were raised to 28 gals, of 10-oz. liquor, equivalent, after allowance for losses in working-up, to about 24 lb. of ammonium sulphate, the industry on its present scale could furnish an addition of about 13,000 tons to the recorded output in 1917, representing an increase of nearly 3 per cent, on the total home production from all sources in .1917.495. Considerable attention has been given to the question of conserving the ammonia liquor hitherto wasted at the smaller gasworks, and upon the basis of existing conditions it appears that the home resources could be increased to the extent of about 1,300 tons of sulphate per annum, or by 0&apos;3 per cent, of the total production from all sources in 1917, if it were possible to collect and utilise the ammonia obtained at such works. The problem, however, is mainly an economic one, as clearly indicated in an Appendix (Appendix III.), and no substantial addition to the home production would accrue even if it were satisfactorily solved.496. To sum up, the gas industry might be in a position to contribute an addition of some 2,400 to 13,000 tons of ammonium sulphate per annum to the home production of fixed nitrogen when conditions become more normal again after the war. This, of course, presup-poses that the industry will be maintained upon the scale reached in 1917, and that the increased demand for coal gas and coke occasioned by the war will persist during the period of industrial reconstruction. The general trend of the evidence available upon this question points to the conclusion that the demand is likely to &quot;continue and perhaps to increase in some directions. Unless, therefore, the industry is handicapped in the immediate future by the price and the quality of the coal available, there is a clear prospect that its present scale will be at least maintained.497. An important consideration arises in regard to the prospective position on the conclusion of peace. The heavy war demands upon all of the larger gasworks have been met, in the main, by the operation of existing retort plant at a higher average load factor than under normal conditions, and only to a small extent by the installation of additional plant. In consequence of the necessity for maintaining a continuous output of gas and by-products, there has. been little opportunity for overhauling and for keeping the plants in the state of i
repair considered necessary before the war. This condition of affairs has been aggravated by the increasing difficulties in regard to the supply of skilled labour. In many cases, the question of overhauling and repair has become a pressing one, and will have to be dealt with immediately upon the cessation of the various war demands. In these circumstances the possibility of a temporary decline in the output of ammonia nitrogen at gasworks after the war must be recognised.The Metallurgical Coke Industry.498. The average yield of ammonia nitrogen per ton of coal carbonised in all types of ovens showed a steady increase from about 13 lb. of ammonium sulphate to about 15 lb. during the three years 1911-13 (Appendix III). A considerable proportion of the coal, usually estimated at about one-third of the total, was coked under conditions which did not permit of the recovery of ammonia or other by-products. It is probable, therefore, that an average yield of about 20 lb. of sulphate was obtained per ton of coal carbonised in recovery ovens during the pre-war period.499. The output of ammonia nitrogen of 1917 represents an average yield of about 18 lb. of sulphate per ton of coal carbonised in all types of ovens. The proportion of the coal coked in non-recovery ovens, however, was smaller than formerly on account of the continuous increase in the number of recovery ovens installed and the rapid decline since 1913 in the^ number of beehive ovens in operation. It is considered that about 75 percent, of the coal now carbonised is dealt with in recovery ovens, and upon this basis the average yield in 1917 represents the equivalent of about 24 lb. of sulphate per ton of coal coked under recovery conditions, an increase of about 20 per cent, on the pre-war figure.500. There are considerable variations in the average yields of ammonium sulphate obtainable from different classes of coking coals by the best modern practice, the figures ranging from about 21 lb. of sulphate per ton in the case of South Wales coal to about 26 lb. and 30 lb. respectively in the cases of Durham and South Yorkshire coals. Before the war about 60 per cent, of the total quantity of coal carbonised per annum at coking works was consumed in Durham and Yorkshire; moreover, over 75 per cent, of the total number of beehive ovens then in operation were located in the same counties.501. The more extensive use of recovery oyens to the exclusion of the beehive type has already had a notable effect upon the output of ammonia nitrogen, and with further progress in this direction, leading perhaps to the eventual abandonment of non-recovery coking,practice, it seems probable that the average yield of sulphate per ton of total coal could be increased to, say, 22&apos; 4 lb. and subsequently to 25 lb. per ton. If the industry were main-tained at the scale attained in 1917 it might in the course of time be able to furnish an addition of some 38,000 to 62,000 tons of ammonium sulphate to the home resources of fixed nitrogen, representing an increase of from 8&apos; 4 to 13&apos; 6 per cent, on the total production from all sources in 1917. An extra output of this order, however, could only be expected as the result of developments extending perhaps over several years.502. The future of the coking industry is essentially bound up with that of the iron and steel industries, and there seems little doubt that the developments in the latter occasioned by the war will be maintained and probably extended in the immediate future. In the opinion of an eminent metallurgical expert consulted by the Committee, the possible consumption of pig-iron after the war might be such as to represent an increase of as much as 50 per cent, upon the pre-war demand for blast furnace coke. When account is taken of the present scale of the coking industry and of the effects resulting from the, eventual displacement of non-recovery ovens, a future demand of the above order would result in a very substantial addition to the home production of ammonia nitrogen.The Producer-gas Industry.503. The average yield of ammonia nitrogen per ton of coal gasified in recovery producers in the pre-war period (average 1911-13) amounted to about 84 &quot;8 lb. of ammonium sulphate (Appendix III.). Practically without exception the yield at all plants has declined during the war, and in 1917 the average for the whole industry had fallen to 66&apos;3 lb. of sulphate per ton of coal gasified, a decline of nearly 22 per cent, from the pre-war figure. When a return can be made to the use of suitable coal after the war, the industry if maintained upon the scale reached in 1917 would thus be able to furnish an extra 7,700 tons of ammonium sulphate merely by the restoration of the average yield to its pre-war value.504. There are several factors having an important influence on the yield of ammonia, such as the quality of the coal, the precise conditions under which the gasification of the coal is effected, and the general character of the load upon the producers (Appendix III. and Appendix IV., Section VL). As a rule, the conditions appear to have been more variable in the case of the smaller plants, but as a relatively small proportion of the total coal was gasified in such plants, a general improvement in the average yield at the smaller plants would not have a material effect upon the output of ammonia nitrogen.   The majority of the larger plants.
showed a consistently high average recovery during the pre-war period and in a few cases only was the average yield less than 80 lb. of sulphate per ton of coal gasified. A marked increase in the yield of ammonia nitrogen has been secured by intimately mixing with the coal a small proportion of hydrated quicklime in the form of a fine powder. The results obtainable by the liming process, however, appear to be influenced to a substantial degree by the character of the coal employed and by other factors (Appendix III.), so that no very definite conclusion can be drawn as to the effect of its^wider use upon the total output of ammonia.505. The steady increase in the demand for power-gas for general industrial purposes, coupled with the growing recognition of the value of coal as a source of combined nitrogen, may be expected to result in a further extension of recovery producer practice. Recovery producers are already used in conjunction with gas-engine plant for the generation of power on a moderate scale, and their application to larger power stations would undoubtedly be stimulated by any improvements leading to a simplification in design and to a lower capital cost. Compared with other commercial methods of treating coal, the gasification process shows to outstanding advantage as regards the yield of ammonia nitrogen, and it is clear that the nitrogen situation in the United Kingdom would be notably modified by a large development in the use of recovery producers.Ironworks.506. The output of ammonia nitrogen from ironworks where raw coal is used in blast furnaces instead of metallurgical coke, represents a very small proportion of the total home production and has exhibited a gradual decline since 1911 (Appendix III.). It is probable that the supply from such ironworks, principally in Scotland, will diminish still further in the future.Miscellaneous Carbonising Works.507. These works are of no practical importance from the point of view of the home production of ammonia nitrogen (Appendix III.).Other Possibilities.508. The problem of conserving a proportion of the potential reserve of nitrogenous and other by-products represented by the enormous annual consumption of raw coal in the United Kingdom is an important factor in the general question of fuel economy. The principal expedients hitherto proposed for dealing with the problem are: (a) The substitution of a smokeless fuel for the raw coal used for domestic and other purposes, the fuel being obtained by the carbonisation of coal at a low temperature under by-product recovery conditions.(6) The application of by-product recovery treatment to the coal used at electric power stations.The possibilities in these directions are dealt with in detail in Appendices (Appendices III. and IV.), and the general observations and conclusions of the Committee are summarised below.509. In regard to the use of smokeless fuel, the industrial operations involved in the pro-duction of fuel equivalent to the 35 million tons of raw coal at present consumed annually for domestic purposes alone would considerably exceed the scale of the whole of the gasworks and coke-oven works in the United Kingdom. If the low temperature process were installed on a scale sufficient to carbonise over a million tons of coal per annum, the output of saleable smokeless fuel would be equivalent to about 2 per cent, of the domestic consumption of raw coal. Upon the basis of the claims made for two distinct methods of carrying out the process, the corresponding output of ammonium sulphate would amount to from 7,000 to 14,000 tons, equivalent to about 1&apos; 5 to 3 per cent, of the home production from all sources in 1917.510. In dealing with the application of by-product recovery to power production, con-sideration has been given to systems involving the carbonisation of coal at high and low temperatures, the gasification of coal or coke under ammonia recovery conditions, and to a combination system involving low temperature carbonisation followed by the gasification of the resulting coke in recovery producers (Appendix IV.). The economic aspects of such power schemes have been fully dealt with in Section IV. (p. 25) of this Report. From the point of view of the conservation of nitrogen only,, the utilisation of such systems at a large power station having a maximum load of 100,000 kw. and an annual load factor of 100 per cent, would involve the consumption of from 32 to 150 per cent, more coal than that required for an equivalent direct-fired station and would result in the production of from 5,600 to 60,000 tons of ammonium sulphate per annum, i.e., from 1&quot; 2 to 13 per cent, of the home pro-cluction from all sources in 1917, as well as large quantities of oil fuels and tar products. The maximum yield of all by-products would probably be gained by a system of power pro-duction involving low temperature carbonisation at a first stage fohWed by the complete gasification of the resulting coke under ammonia recovery conditions.511. The above considerations indicate that the successful development and extension of a process for carbonising coal at a low temperature would have an important influence upon the
home production of ammonia nitrogen. The prospects, however, are ontiroly in the future; because no standard form of plant for carrying out the process has yet been brought into successful operation on a full commercial scale and the vital questions of average yields and working costs still remain to be determined.512. Reference is also made in an Appendix (Appendix, III.) to a proposal for utilising a mixture of coking coal and peat for the manufacture of metallurgical coke or smokeless fuel by carbonisation under by-product recovery&apos; conditions in ordinary coke-ovens. Promising results have been obtained in the trials already carried out, but further investigations are necessary before&apos; the prospects of the method can be estimated.NITROGEN FROM SHALE.513. The Director of the Geological Survey has furnished the Committee with an estimate of the reserves of Scottish oil-shales which is set out in an Appendix (Appendix III., p. 164). The Committee has no other definite data concerning the total home reserves of shale or of other materials such as cannel, bituminous clays, and the like, which may be considered of equal importance in connection with the production of oils and ammonia nitrogen. There is little doubt, however, that the reserves of these materials are sufficient for the maintenance of an oil industry on a much larger scale than hitherto, and the question of the further development of the industry has recently come into considerable prominence on account of the increasing home demand for oil fuels of all classes.514. The Scottish shale oil industry is one of long standing, but has remained practically stationary for some years past, the quantity of shale distilled annually approximating to 3,000,000 tons. Notwithstanding the great variations in the yields of oil and ammonia from different seams of shale and from different portions of the same seam, it is remarkable to find that the average yield of fixed nitrogen for the whole industry over a period of years has been practically constant at about 43 lb. of ammonium sulphate per ton, corresponding to a total annual production of the order of 60,000 tons (Appendix III.).515. There appears to be little prospect of improving upon the yield of ammonia already attained by the modern methods of retorting shale and an addition to the present output of fixed nitrogen is only to be expected by the extension of the oil industry. If other deposits of shale were opened up and led to the doubling of the present scale of the industry, a develop-ment which would probably require several years to effect, the addition of perhaps a further 60,000 tons of sulphate per annum might be made to the home production of fixed nitrogen, corresponding to about 13 per cent, of the total output from all sources in 1917.NITROGEN FROM PEAT.516. It is estimated that the deposits of peat in the United Kingdom amount to not less than 5,000 million tons, calculated as free from moisture, with an average nitrogen content of perhaps 1&quot; 5 per cent, (on the dry peat) although in the case of some bogs the figure is as high as &apos;2&apos;5 per cent, and over. The raw peat usually contains from 85 to 92 per cent, of water, and the problem of utilising it on a really substantial scale for the recovery of nitrogen is only to be solved by devising a method, capable of continuous operation and independent of climatic conditions, whereby the moisture content can be reduced to a workable value, say,&apos;of 50 per cent, or less, at a cost which will not render the entire process uneconomical (Appendix V., Section XIIL).517. When peat containing up to 50 per cent, of moisture is treated in gas producers under ammonia recovery conditions, about 70 per cent, of its nitrogen content can be obtained in the form of ammonia or ammonium sulphate. Upon the basis of the average figure quoted above, the deposits in the United Kingdom thus represent a potential source of 50 million tons of combined nitrogen or 250 million tons of ammonium sulphate. Owing however, to the character and low nitrogen content of some of the deposits and to other factors such as inaccessibility, it is certain that considerable portions could never be economically utilised for nitrogen recovery.518. Numerous attempts on substantial commercial scales have been made to obtain ammonia from peat, usually in conjunction with the production of power gas, and are referred to in some detail in an Appendix (Appendix V., Section XIII.). Although some of these attempts have been attended with success- under the conditions prevailing in the countries where they have been carried on, they have all been hampered by the difficulty of providing peat fuel in sufficient quantities to ensure the continuous &quot;operation of producer installations of even moderate capacity.&apos; The importance of this factor will be recognised when it is pointed out that the recovery of a ton of ammonium sulphate involves the excavation and treatment of from 90 to 400 tons of raw peat (according to its content of nitrogen and moisture), and the removal of from 63 to 360 tons of water from the raw material in order to render it suitable as a fuel for recovery producers.
519. The Committee has devoted considerable attention to the prospects of utilising peat either for nitrogen recovery alone or for the generation of electrical energy with by-product recovery as an auxiliary. As shown in detail in an Appendix (Appendix IV.) the quantity of peat fuel required for the continuous operation of an installation of even moderate capacity is very substantial. In the case of a producer and gas-engine electric installation of 5,000 kw. maximum demand operating at an annual load factor of 100 per cent., it would be necessary to gasify from 83,000 to 108,000 tons of peat fuel (35 to 50 per cent, moisture) per annum, representing the excavation and drying of from 360,000 to 540,000 tons of raw peat (85 to 90 per cent, moisture), apart altogether from the provision of reserve fuel. If the peat contained 1&apos;5 per cent, of nitrogen (calculated on the dry material) and 70 per cent, were recovered in the gasification process, the annual output of ammonium sulphate would be of the order of 2,800 tons, Or only 0&quot; 6 of the total output from all sources in 1917. Many installations of the above capacity would thus have to come into operation in order to enable peat to contribute any substantial addition to the present home output of fixed nitrogen.520. The magnitude of the problem of providing the peat fuel required even by a single installation is apparent, and reliance upoii natural air-drying of raw peat for its manufacture would seem to be out of the question when regard is had to the climatic conditions prevailing in the United Kingdom. Of other processes hitherto proposed, the mechanical filtration of peat under pressure appears to hold out the best promise of success provided an economical method can be devised for rendering the raw peat amenable to filtration by partly or wholly destroying its colloidal nature. Various attempts have been made in this direction and are referred to in an Appendix (Appendix V., Section XIII.), but none of them can be said to have been commercially successful. &quot;!521. Notwithstanding the immense potential reserve of combined nitrogen in the peat deposits of the United Kingdom, there - is no immediate prospect of it becoming a source of marketable products. In the present state of our knowledge, it is more economical to fix the nitrogen in the atmosphere than to recover the combined nitrogen existing in peat.NITROGEN FROM SEWAGE.522. Having regard to the statements that have been made,, concerning the potentialities of sewage as a source of fixed nitrogen, the Committee deemed it necessary to investigate this question in detail. The inquiry was facilitated by the receipt of a valuable memorandum from a leading authority upon the subject, and an abstract of the information supplied by him is given in an Appendix (Appendix V&apos;., Section XIV.).523. From data relating to the average daily excretion of nitrogen by adults and children, and upon the basis of a population of 45 million, it is estimated that the annual value of the domestic sewage of the United Kingdom in terms of combined nitrogen is as follows :-, Table 58.-ANNUAL NITROGEN CONTENT OF SEWAGE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.&apos;Source.	Fixed Nitrogen in Sewage per Annum. :		Total Metric Tons.,,	Percentage &quot;of Total.Nitrogen in urine      ....	202,000	86Nitrogen in faeces      -      -      -      -	32,900	14Total    -	234,900	100524. As bearing upon the above figures it maybe noted that the estimated, quantity of protein in the annual supplies of food materials available for human consumption in the United Kingdom in the years preceding the war (average 1909-13) represents the equivalent of about 230,000 metric tons of fixed nitrogen (The Food Supply of the United Kingdom; Report by a Committee of the Royal Society, Od. 8421, 1917).525. The annual excretion of nitrogen amounts to nearly three times the average annual output of the entire by-product ammonia industry prior to the war, but it is important to note that 86 per cent, of the total nitrogen in sewage is contained in urine and is in a soluble form which cannot easily be precipitated. V   ,526. It is estimated that the houses of half the total population are not connected up to sewers, so that 50 per cent, of the total excretion of nitrogen may practically be written off as far as the recovery of marketable nitrogen products is concerned. Even if the systematic collection of concentrated sewageiwere undertaken in special cases for the recovery of ammonia, as has been done abroad, the effect upon the home output of ammonia would be very small. In France, where the practice has been resorted to on a larger scale than elsewhere, the nitrogen recovered from sewage in the pre-war period represented the equivalent of 12,000
tone of ammonium sulphate per annum.   The operations, however, were of a nauseous character, and are said to have been both costly and dangerous.527. With regard to the population whose houses are connected up to sewers, about 43 per cent, of the total annual excretion of nitrogen is carried away in such a dilute form that it is unlikely to contribute to the supplies of marketable nitrogen unless research, leads to the discovery of cheap reagents capable of precipitating soluble nitrogen. Under existing conditions, the water-borne nitrogen can only be partially utilised in certain cases on sewage farms.528. The sludge from water-borne sewage is a low-grade product containing a large percentage of moisture and some 1 to 2&apos; 5 per cent, of nitrogen, calculated on the dry sludge. Although the sludge has some manurial value, it has not proved sufficiently useful to be generally adopted by farmers, and therefore contributes very little to the fertiliser supply. In some cases the sludge is degreased, and the resulting grease is a valuable commodity, but tke the process does not improve the fertilising value of the sludge. (Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal, 9th Report, Vol. II., Od. 7820, 1915, pp. 158-60.)529. The Committee has also considered a process for carbonising sewage sludge for the recovery of ammonium sulphate, motor spirit and fuel oils, The process has been installed on a scale sufficient to deal with the sludge from a population of about 55,000, but the time during which it has been in operation is not adequate to have established its economic prospects. The operations nevertheless provide a basis for measuring the quantity of ammonium sulphate recoverable from sewage sludge, and it appears that the estimated annual production from the sludge of all the towns in the United Kingdom having a population of 100,000 and over,would only be of the order of 22,000 tons of sulphate, or about 5 per cent, of the total annual output of the by-product ammonia industry before the war.530. As the result of a careful survey of the position, the Committee has come to the conclusion that, in the present state of our knowledge, there is little or no prospect of obtaining large additional supplies of marketable nitrogen compounds from sewage as long as the purification of the latter is carried out by the principal methods now in vogue. This conclusion, however, might need revision if the activated sludge process of purification (Appendix V., Section XIV.) should become common. This process yields a sludge con-taining, when dry, some 6 or 7 per cent, of nitrogen, and from the tests so far made the sludge appears to be of high fertilising value. Further investigations were initiated by the Munitions Inventions Department upon this question.OBSERVATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS.531. It was shown in a previous section of this Report, that in order to render the United Kingdom independent of imported nitrogen products and at the same time to enable a large export trade to be maintained, the total home production of ammonia nitrogen alone would have to be increased to 125,000 metric tons per annum to satisfy the estimated visible demand on the conclusion of peace, and subsequently to 182,000 metric tons per annum to meet the estimated possible demand in the near future. Upon the basis of the output from all sources in 1917, namely 94,000 metric tons of ammonia nitrogen, the home production would thus have to be increased by approximately 31,000 metric tons of ammonia nitrogen per annum as &apos; a first step, and eventually by 88,000 metric tons per annum. In other words, the present scale of production would require to be augmented at an early date by the equivalent of about 155,000 tons of ammonium sulphate per annum and ,by 440,000 tons per annum in the near future, corresponding to increases of about 33 and 100 per cent, respectively upon the recorded output in 1917.532. Dealing in the first place with the visible home production following the termination of the war, the investigations of the Committee point to the definite conclusion that an immediate increase on the present output can only be looked for in the case of gasworks and producer-gas works. The war conditions have had an adverse influence upon the output of fixed nitrogen at these works and, in effect, have created a potential margin of productive capacity. With the removal of the temporary restrictions upon the manufacture of ammonium sulphate and with supplies of coal of a better quality again available, the gas and producer-gas industries, on the basis of the scale of operations attained in 1917, are likely to furnish an addition of some 10,000 tons of ammonium sulphate to the annual production. Beyond this, however, there appears to be no Other prospect of a substantial immediate increase in the home supplies of by-product nitrogen.533. On the other hand, there is a constantly growing demand for all classes of fuel products, and for by-products such as benzol which are suitable for motor fuel, and in view of the efforts that will undoubtedly be made to maintain and extend the industrial developments occasioned, by the war, the by-product ammonia industries may be expected to make further large contributions of fixed nitrogen in the course of a period of years. Of the existing industries, coking works, producer-gas works, gasworks and shale distillation works are all likely to contribute increases, and probably in the order specified.   Low
temperature carbonisation cannot be disregarded as a potential factor in the nitrogen situation, although it is difficult, in the present state of knowledge, to draw definite con-clusions as to its future prospects. With regard to peat and sewage, the Committee is of the opinion that little or no reliance can be placed upon these resources for any considerable quantities of marketable nitrogen compounds, although some reservation is perhaps necessary in the case of sewage for reasons previously noted.534. The statistics and other data already presented establish, beyond doubt, that the actual and potential resources of by-product nitrogen in the United Kingdom are adequate for meeting a demand of almost any magnitude. It does not follow, however, that it would be either practicable, economical or sound policy to place entire reliance upon these resources if it were decided to aim at ultimate independence of external supplies of nitrogen products. Consideration must therefore be given to each of the factors just mentioned, in order that the general character of the question at issue may be clearly appreciated.535. In the first j)lace, successful methods of utilising some of the potential resources still remain to be devised, and even when this has been done, it is safe, in the light of past experience, to predict that many years would be required to bring about developments on a scale sufficient to have a material effect upon the home production of fixed nitrogen. Similar considerations apply to the large-scale extension of existing commercial processes which have only attained their present stage of development as the result of gradual progress spread over a period of years. From the point of view of nitrogen supply, a serious practical objection to by-product recovery processes is the enormous tonnage of material that has to be handled and treated in order to obtain a substantial output of ammonia nitrogen, and the vast scale of the plant that would be needed for rendering the country self-supporting. It may be recalled that from 35 to 40 million tons of coal have been consumed annually in the three principal by-product ammonia industries alone in contributing the equivalent of from 340,000 to 400,000 tons of ammonium sulphate. The tonnage figures would be even more serious in schemes involving the utilisation of peat (Appendix IV., Section VII., and Appendix V., Section XIII.). As a further point, it must be noted that some of the by-product recovery processes are not well adapted for rapid extension in case of emergencies, and might again fail to maintain a normal output of fixed nitrogen under the economic conditions prevailing in time of war.536. In the next place, probably one-third of the ultimate home production of ammonia nitrogen would require to be converted into nitrate and nitric nitrogen to meet the demands of agriculture and industry. The figures given in previous sections of this Report show that such demands, with the possible exception of that for sodium nitrate, could be met more economically by synthetic methods than by the oxidation of by-product ammonia even if the latter were charged at the lowest market price hitherto recorded in the United Kingdom. Of the remaining two-thirds of the ultimate home production, probably 90 per cent, would be absorbed by agriculture at home and by the export trade, and the national interests would demand a cheap form of fixed nitrogen for both purposes. The price of nitrogen is an important factor in the general economy of by-product recovery processes, and every reduction in the market price would diminish the incentive to the use of recovery plant in industries in which the removal of by-product ammonia was not compulsory. Even under the most favourable conditions in regard to the demand for illuminating gas, gasworks coke, metal-lurgical coke, producer-gas, and so on, the price of nitrogen would, broadly speaking, impose an economic limit to the extension of ammonia recovery by existing.processes, to the development of new processes, and to the application of by-product recovery in new directions such as to power production on a large scale. Moreover, when regard is had to the inevitable thermal losses in all methods of treating fuel, the increasing necessity for utilising the national resources in coal to the maximum advantage would undoubtedly impose a restriction upon the use of by-product recovery processes merely for the purpose of conserving products that could be obtained more economically by synthetic or other methods.537. To sum up, it would clearly, be a sounder policy from all points of view to take advantage of the modern developments in nitrogen fixation and to resort to a variety of methods for meeting such large requirements as have been indicated, rather than to place entire reliance upon by-product ammonia. There is no question that the most important nitrogen products, with the possible exception of nitrates, can be obtained more cheaply by synthetic methods than by the non-synthetic processes hitherto in use, and the plants and quantities of raw materials required for a given output of fixed nitrogen are relatively small as compared with those needed for by-product recovery processes. The facility with which nitrogen fixation installations can be extended in the event-of a national emergency has been amply demonstrated in other countries in the course uf the war.538. After a full consideration of the various aspects of the question, the Committee has come to the conclusion that while much could be done by the extension and development of by-product recovery processes, a policy directed towards ultimate independence of imported nitrogen products would essentially involve the establishment in this country of nitrogen fixation upon a large scale.
539. The Committee is satisfied that synthetic processes can at the present time be operated in the United Kingdom upon a sound economic basis and that the undoubted advantages enjoyed by such methods will become more pronounced in the course of time as the result of constant efforts towards improvement.540. The desirability of entire independence of external supplies of nitrogen products in peace time is perhaps a debateable question. On the other hand, the lessons learned during the war have shown the vital importance of preparedness, and the Committee has no hesitation in stating that no risk whatever should be run in regard to provision for safeguarding the future.541. The Committee is emphatically of the opinion that the national interests demand the establishment forthwith of nitrogen fixation and allied processes upon a considerable manu-iiacturing scale. These processes would enable a portion of the growing home demand for various forms of combined nitrogen to be economically met, and the country would be in possession of both the experience and the nucleus plants essential as an insurance against future emergencies. The minimum scale of provision required as a first stage is specified in the recommendations at the end of this Report (see p.. 133)..XII.-NITROGEN FIXATION IN OTHER PARTS OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE.542. The Committee has been required to consider the relative advantages of methods for the fixation of atmospheric: nitrogen from the standpoint of the, war and peace requirements of the British Empire.   . .    \ .       .543. An extremely wide field of inquiry is embraced in these aspects of the nitrogen problem, and it is obvious that a centrally organised committee could only explore the&apos;situation in its broadest outline. Nevertheless, with a view to presenting a general summary of the possibilities, the Committtee has endeavoured to collect and correlate as much detailed information as has been obtainable in the present difficult circumstances.544. As the result of representations made by the Committee in the early part of 1917, the Right Hon. C. Addison, M.P., then Minister of Munitions, drew the attention of the Dominion Governments, of the India Office and of the Colonial Office to the progress that had been made in regard to the general inquiry.&apos; He suggested the desirability of ascertaining whether the nitrogen problem was likely to have special interest to the Overseas Governments from the point of view of munitions or agriculture, and that, if such were found to be the case, communications might be opened up with the Committee through the Controller of Munitions Inventions. The steps thus initiated led to the nomination of official representatives to confer with the Committee upon the economic aspects of the problem audits bearing upon the present and future needs of the various portions of the Empire.   These official representatives were:Australia      -  A. E. heighten, Esq., General Manager of the Australian Arsenal.M. Bell, Esq., Superintendent of the Arsenal Laboratories.        1 Canada   -     -  Prof. J. C. McLennan, O.B.E., M.A., Ph.D., F.R.S., Chairman of theCanadian Advisory Research Council and representative of theImperial Munitions Board. Egypt . -     -  Sir Murdoch Macdonald, K.C.M.G., Under Secretary of State for public Works.India   -        -  J. C. Burnham, Esq., C.S.I.. B.Sc, F.I.C., Manager of the CorditeFactory, Aruvankadu.1 New Zealand  -  J. D. Elliott, Esq., M.Inst.C.E., Consulting Engineer to the dominion government,South Africa  -  Lt.-Col. W. Oullen, M.I.M.M., past President of the South African Chemical, Metallurgical and Mining Society.The Committee has also conferred with a representative of the Government of Mysore, W. F. Smeeth, Esq., D.Sc, M.A., A.R.S.M., Director, Department of Mines and Geology.545. The Imperial aspects of the nitrogen problem may be broadly considered from two points of view: (a) The present and potential domestic requirements of individual parts of the Empire and the resources available.for the local production of nitrogen compounds.(b) Imperial co-operation in regard to insurance against future contingencies and to the peace requirements of the Empire as a whole.The Committee is indebted to the official representatives of the Overseas Governments for information upon the first issue ; a certain amount of additional data has also been obtained from other sources.   A summary of the evidence available is given below.546. In dealing Avith the different countries of the Empire, an attempt has been madelo indicate the nature and extent of the local production, importation and exportation of nitrogen
products and hence the magnitude of the present requirements. Consideration is then given to the broad features of the agricultural situation and to the prospects of the future home demand for nitrogenous fertilisers. Finally, a brief account is given of the natural resources in raw materials, such as coal and limestone, which have a special bearing upon the question of nitrogen recovery and fixation, and also of the potentialities in regard to cheap water power.547. The Committee has purposely refrained from making use of any opinions upon Imperial policy that were given in the course of evidence, because it was specifically stated in some instances that the opinions were entirely personal and given without prejudice. The conclusions embodied in the latter portion of this section of the Beport are therefore to be regarded as expressing the views of the Committee alone.AUSTRALIA.548. Apart from a small amount of shale, the deposits of coal represent the only source of combined nitrogen in Australia. The &quot;statistics supplied to the Committee indicate that the quantity of ammonia nitrogen recovered annually from the coal carbonised at gasworks and at coke-oven works represents the equivalent of about 12,750 tons of ammonium sulphate. In addition, it is estimated, that there is an annual loss of ammonia nitrogen to the extent of 3,500 tons of sulphate consequent upon the employment of beehive coke-ovens. About 10 per cent, of the combined nitrogen recovered annually is utilised in the form of ammonia, the remainder being converted into ammonium sulphate. The exports of ammonium sulphate in 1914 and 1915, principally to New Zealand, Java and Japan, amounted to about 5,650 tons. It thus appears that approximately one-half of the total production of ammonia nitrogen has hitherto sufficed for meeting home requirements.549. The principal nitrogen products imported into Australia are nitrates, mining explo-sives, and cyanides for the gold-mining industry. There has been a progressive increase in the imports of Chile nitrate, the nett imports in 1916-17 amounting to about 7,900 tons as compared with about 3,300 tons in 1914, about 2,200 tons in 1908, and 1,200 tons in 1907. Potassium nitrate was also imported to the average extent of about 400 tons per annum (excluding 1916-17). The requirements for mining explosives, chiefly of the gelignite class, are substantial, the annual imports from the United Kingdom and South Africa amounting to about 5,250 tons. The statistical returns published by the Commonwealth do not specify the imports of cyanides nor, in fact, the imports or home production of any of the above-mentioned nitrogen products..; 550. The above figures point to the conclusion that the nitrogen requirements of Australia have hitherto been comparatively small. The total demand for nitrogen products, exclusive of mining explosives and of cyanides, is estimated to amount to 2,700 tons of fixed nitrogen per annum, in the form of 1,500 tons of ammonia nitrogen and 1,200 tons of nitrate nitrogen. It will be observed that the estimated demand approximates to the quantity of fixed nitrogen recovered annually from coal.551. The Committee has no definite information upon the comparative values of different artificial fertilisers under Australian conditions. It appears, however, that this subject has been investigated at various agricultural colleges and experimental farms. At the present time the principal demand is for rock phosphates and superphosphate, which have been found very suitable for the growing of cereals. The consumption of all other artificial fertilisers, including nitrogenous manures, is small. With regard to the future demand for the latter, contrary opinions have been expressed by those conversant with local conditions. On the one hand, it has been said that there is no opening for nitrogenous manures ; on the other hand, it has been stated that the small use of nitrogenous fertilisers has been due to the question of price and that in the event of ammonium sulphate or Chile nitrate being obtainable for, say,  10 per ton, there would be a large demand. It is significant to note, in regard to agriculture in general, that statistics dealing with the relation between the manured and unmanured areas under crop in different Australian States point to the growing recognition of the value of fertilisation.552. The Committee has received a certain amount of general information regarding the resources and industries in Australia, and the matter relevant to the various aspects of nitrogen recovery and fixation is summarised below.553. In the first place, there are considerable deposits of coal in most of the states, but these deposits exhibit marked variations in quality, ranging from good coal, suitable for steam-raising, gas-making and household use, to low quality brown coal and lignite. There has been a progressive increase in the output of coal, the quantity mined in Australia and Tasmania in 1914 amounting to about 12&apos;4 million tons, of which 10&apos;4 million tons were obtained in New South Wales and 1 million tons in Queensland.  There was a decline in 1915
and 1916, the output of coal in these years being IT4 and 9&apos;8 million tons respectively. In 1914, the consumption of coal at gasworks and coke-oven works amounted to about 1&apos;3 million tons. There has been further progress in the installation of recovery coke-ovens during the war, the quantity of coal carbonised at coke-ovens and gasworks in 1916 amounting to 1&apos; 5 million tons. It is clear that the carbonisation industries may be expected to augment the home resources in ammonia nitrogen because domestic and industrial requirements will continue to expand. As bearing upon the recovery of by-product ammonia, it may be noted that considerable quantities of sulphuric acid are manufactured in Australia. The Committee has been informed that there are plentiful supplies of limestone, but no details are available as to the quality of the deposits.Table 59.-MOTIVE POWER IN COMMONWEALTH FACTORIES, 1916.

Although there are potential water power resources of considerable magnitude in Australia, particularly in the eastern area of the continent, no developments have yet been effected which are capable of furnishing large supplies of cheap power such as would be necessary for the economical operation of some, of the nitrogen fixation processes. At the present time, dependence is mainly placed upon coal as a source of power, and the actual horse-power of the engines employed in electric lighting and power works in the Common-wealth (including Tasmania) amounted in 1914 to about 172,700 h.p., and in 1916 to about 192,700 h.p. As these works comprised upwards of 200 establishments, it is clear that, in general, the individual stations must be of small size and that the price of electrical energy must necessarily be on the high side, apart from factors such as the cost to the power stations of coal of the requisite quality. An indication of the power requirements of works and factories in the Commonwealth (including Tasmania) is afforded by the fact that the actual horse-power of all the engines employed at such works and factories amounted in 1914 to a total of about 491,200 h.p., and by 1916 had increased to about 529,700 h.p. The nature of the motive power employed at 11,550 works and factories in 1916 is shown in the table above.I CANADA.555. The deposits of coal and shale in Canada constitute the only home sources of combined nitrogen. Statistics for the ammonia nitrogen recovered annually at gasworks do not appear to be available, but the quantities are probably small in the light of the data given subsequently. The quantity. recovered annually at coke-oven works has fluctuated somewhat, as is shown by the following figures:  Table 60:-CANADTAN PRODUCTION OF AMMONIUM SULPHATE AT COKE-OVENS, 1911-16.Product.

556. Canada imports a large variety of nitrogen products, in some cases in considerable quantities, and the following table embodies the statistics for a number of the principal imports:    .Table 61.-CANADIAN IMPORTS-OF NITROGEN PRODUCTS.Product.

Ammonium nitrate was also imported from Norway, and, prior to the war, from Belgium. A portion of the cyanide products and the major part of the ammonium chloride were obtained from the United Kingdom.557. From the preceding tables it is clear that the Canadian requirements for combined nitrogen for all purposes have hitherto been small, the home production of ammonia nitrogen and the imports of nitrogen products representing the equivalent of perhaps 10,000 to 12,000 tons of fixed nitrogen.558. The position held by Canada in regard to agriculture is well-known, the country ranking among the world&apos;s leading producers of wheat and oats. The need for artificial fertilisers, however, has not hitherto been apparent on account of the rapidity with which the area under cultivation has been extended by the opening up of vast tracts of virgin land in the West. In the Eastern provinces the position is somewhat different, and the Committee has been informed that artificial fertilisation will soon have to be resorted to ; for example, in the Montreal district, where the agricidtural lands are already showing signs of diminished fertility. In view of these considerations and of the extension of intensive agriculture, as in the Niagara peninsula and in the valley and delta of the Fraser River, the demand for fertilisers will soon increase, and the Government, through its system of experimental farms in different parts of the country, is already endeavouring to educate farmers in the use of artificial manures. There is little question that in the course of time the use of fertilisers will have to become general if the productiveness of the corn lands is to be maintained or perhaps increased to cope with the continual growth in the requirements of the wheat-consuming peoples of the world. Although, therefore, there may be no immediate prospect of a large demand for nitrogenous fertilisers in Canada, the future requirements must be considerable.559. From the point of view of nitrogen recovery and fixation, Canada possesses two resources of immense potential value, namely,&quot;coal and water power. The Canadian coalfields rank only second in importance to those of the United States, and contain about 16 &quot;4 percent, of the world&apos;s known and estimated reserves of coal as compared with 2&apos;6 per cent, in the case of Great Britain. The deposits appear to comprise all classes of coal, ranging from anthracite and semi-anthracite to lignite. At the present time the chief centres of the mining industry are on the eastern and western sides, little or no coal being produced in the central provinces. In spite of the steady growth of the industry, the annual production is small when contrasted with that of other countries, the figures for the years 1911, 1913 and 1916 in millions of tons being 11 &quot;32,15&apos;01 and 14&apos;48 respectively. It is noticeable, however, that the imports of coal have usually exceeded the home production, and this appears to be due mainly to&apos; the requirements of the central provinces and to the proximity of the Pennsylvanian coalfields of the United States. The imports in 1913 amounted to 18&apos;2 million tons, and in 1916 to 17&apos;58 million tons.
560. The consumption of coal at coke-oven works in the years 1914-16 amounted to 1&quot;54, 1&apos; 85 and 2 &quot;13 million tons respectively, but a considerable portion was carbonised under non-recovery conditions, seeing that of the corresponding output of coke about 67, 66 and 69 per cent, respectively was obtained from by-product ovens. Statistics are not available for the quantity of coal carbonised at gasworks, of which there are about 40 in Canada. The annual output of tar from gasworks is estimated at 5 million gallons, and upon the basis of average practice in the United Kingdom it would therefore appear that some 500,000 tons of coal are carbonised per annum. The small scale of the coal-gas industry is principally due to the competition of natural gas, about 23 companies being engaged in the distribution of the latter. The production of natural gas in the years 1914 to 1916 amounted to 21,692, 20,124 and 25,467 million cubic feet respectively. In the event of the commercial develop-ment of the Hausser or Bender processes (Appendix V., Sections IX. and XII,), this gas would constitute a potential source of nitric and nitrate nitrogen.561. As bearing upon the question of the conservation of by-product ammonia, the following statistics for the production, imports and exports of sulphuric acid are of interest: Table 62.-CANADIAN PRODUCTION, IMPORTS AND EXPORTS OF SULPHURIC ACID,1912-17.Items.	&apos; &apos;              Short Tons of 2,000 lb.						1912.	1913,	1914.          1915.		1916.	1917.* ,Home production in terms of 660 Be acid     93-19 per cent.

It is clear that the production of munitions in Canada during the war has led to a substantial expansion of the sulphuric acid industry.562. The magnitude of the water power resources of Canada may be gauged by the fact that the estimated power available, upon the basis of the data already systematically collected, amounts to 18 &quot;8 million horse-power.   These resources are well distributed all over the country, except in Saskatchewan, the province with probably the greatest agricultural future. Moreover, their potential value is largely enhanced by reason of their proximity to existing com-mercial centres. It has been stated that water powers are within economic transmission distance of practically every important city from the Atlantic to the Pacific with the exception of those situated in the central western prairies.   There is no doubt that many of the large powers are capable of easy development and of furnishing electrical energy at a cost which would be extremely favourable from the point of view of nitrogen fixation.   The water power resources are already developed to the extent of about 1,736,000 h.p., principally in Ontario (789,000 h.p.), Quebec (520,000 h.p.), and British Columbia (269,000 h.p.).    Municipal, domestic, and ordinary industrial requirements absorb about 1,348,000 h.p., and the pulp and paper; industry about 248,000 h.p., while the remaining 140,000 h.p. is  utilised for electrochemical and similar processes.563. With regard to other resources, there are abundant supplies of limestone and of crystalline marble of high quality in various parts of the Dominion. It is of interest to observe that there has been a large development in the manufacture of calcium carbide in Canada during the war period. Figures are not available for the quantity consumed locally in the manufacture of munitions and the like, but an approximate idea of the progress made is afforded by the following statistics for the exports of carbide during the years 1913-17.Table 63.-CANADIAN EXPORTS OF CALCIUM CARBIDE.Peoduct.

564. The value of such, an industry as a potential nucleus for the establishment of the calcium cyanamide industry is apparent. The manufacture of the latter product is already carried on in Canada by an American company at Niagara, but the Committee understands that little or none of the production is actually utilised in the Dominion. The Committee has been informed that the quantity of calcium cyanamide made and exported by the company in 1916 amounted to about 30,000 short tons, and that the exports for the fiscal year ending March 31st, 1918, amounted to 46,387 short tons.EGYPT.565. In contrast with the position in other parts of the Empire, there are no home sources of combined nitrogen in Egypt, and the country is entirely dependent upon external supplies, even for a nitrogen-bearing material like coal. The Committee has no information as to whether ammonia is recovered as a by-product from any of the coal consumed annually in Egypt.566. Egypt is almost entirely^an agricultural country, and-the extent to which artificial nitrogenous fertilisers were employed before the war is indicated by the following figures which were supplied to the Committee : Table 64.-EGYPTIAN IMPORTS OF NITROGENOUS FERTILISERS.Puoduct.

The cost of the product on shore in Egypt increased to, about  30 per ton, in 1917, but notwith-standing the high price, the consumption in 1917 amounted to over 30,000 tons, an economic return being assured by the prevailing prices of agricultural produce. The Committee has been informed that it is difficult to assign a limit to the potential demand for nitrate fertilisers in Egypt as they are being employed to an increasing extent upon land already under cultivation, and further land to which they will be applied is being brought into cultivation.567. Considerable attention has been devoted to the relative fertilising values, under Egyptian conditions, of Chile nitrate, nitrate of lime, and calcium cyanamide, and the Committee has been furnished with the results of a number of comparative trials carried out by the Ministry.of Agriculture. These trials were conducted upon an identical system in four different localities in Egypt, the nitrate fertilisers being applied in- two dressings, one just after the thinning of the crop and before watering, and the other before the next watering. The whole of the calcium cyanamide was applied before sowing, being mixed with an equal quantity of fine earth and moistened the day before application. The results obtained from the application of equal weights of combined nitrogen in the forms specified above were extremely divergent, although care had been exercised to obtain fields of apparently equal quality throughout. For instance, calcium cyanamide gave both the highest and the lowest yields on two of the plots at one farm, and also at a second farm. Generally speaking, there was a tendency for the nitrate fertilisers to show to the greatest advantage, calcium cyanamide not giving quite as good a produce as the others although proving the best on some of the individual plots. It is interesting in this connection to recall the results of experiments in the United Kingdom with calcium cyanamide (Table 17, page .19).568. The evidence supplied to the Committee indicates that in the view of a number of agricultural experts in Egypt, a nitrogen fertiliser containing free or combined lime would show to advantage as compared with Chile nitrate and that, on the whole, nitrate of lime is preferable to calcium cyanamide. It is pointed out that the nitrification of calcium cyanamide in the soil is not quick enough to satisfy the wants of some of the rapid-growing crops; on the other hand, the colour and appearance of this fertiliser render it less easy of adulteration with common salt, which is very harmful to Egyptian soils. With further experience in the&apos; use of synthetic fertilisers, it is probable that nitrate of lime and calcium cyanamide would both prove to have a useful application. .H 2
569. From the point of view of nitrogen fixation, Egypt possesses a potential asset of considerable value in the water power capable of development at the Aswan Dam. Upon the basis of the minimum discharge of water and the available head, it is estimated that, with the river controlled as at present, the water horse-power ranges from 123,000 to 196,000 h.p. during five months of the year and from 19,000 to 70,000 h.p. during the remaining months. When the White Nile dam comes into operation, the estimated power at Aswan will be increased, ranging from 123,000 to 261,000 water h.p. during six months of the year, the figures for the other months being practically as before. According to the detailed figures submitted to the Committee, it appears that a continuous supply of 32,000 water h.p. could be obtained for ten consecutive months, and a continuous supply of 25,000 water h.p. for eleven consecutive months during the year. These estimates are considered to be conservative and probably on the low side. With the barrage already in existence, it is estimated that the further works required will permit of the development of the power for less than  1 per full k.w.-year. A nitrogen fixation installation dependent upon a supply of power showing the considerable variations indicated above would obviously be under a handicap, although the estimated cost of the power is undoubtedly a great attraction.570. The Committee has been informed that there are abundant supplies of high quality limestone in Egypt, so that one of the raw materials required for the manufacture of nitrate of lime or calcium cyanamide is available locally. Supplies of natural gas have also recently been opened up in Egypt. The commercial development of the Hausser or Bender processes (Appendix V., Sections IX. and XII.) would render this gas a potential source of nitric and nitrate nitrogen.571. The Committee was asked, in the light of the evidence submitted, to formulate an opinion as to the scale upon which the manufacture of synthetic nitrogen fertilisers might be undertaken at Aswan, and to indicate the probable costs. It was pointed out by&apos; the Committee that the class of fertiliser best suited for Egyptian requirements and the probable demand were matters for the determination of the Agricultural Advisers of the Egyptian Government who are conversant with the position in that country. In view, however, of the importance to an agricultural country like Egypt of developing an internal supply of nitrogenous fertilisers and of the availability of a source of cheap power, the Committee felt that definite suggestions of a constructive character, although put forward with reserve, might prove of some assistance. A memorandum embodying the views of the Committee was therefore prepared and transmitted to the official representative of the Egyptian Government.INDIA.572. The principal sources of combined nitrogen in India at the present time are the natural saltpetre earths in which potassium nitrate is formed by the bacterial nitrification of organic matter in the presence of atmospheric oxygen and metallic bases. The product is obtained as an efflorescence upon the surface of the soil and by the lixiviation of the salt-petre earths. The annual production and exportation of potassium nitrate are shown in the following table: Table 65.-INDIAN PRODUCTION AND EXPORTS OF SALTPETRE,Items.

A small amount of potassium nitrate is utilised in India for the manufacture of nitric acid, but it is apparent that the export trade accounts for practically the whole of the * production. The general position of the industry has been materially modified in recent years before the war by the large development in Europe of the double-decomposition process for the manufacture of potassium nitrate from Stassfurt potassium chloride and Chile nitrate. During the war, the former product has not been available to the Allies, and the effect of this is reflected in the figures for 1915-17 quoted in the above table.
574. The coal deposits in India constitute the only other home source of combined nitrogen. It is estimated, however, that the annual recovery of ammonium sulphate is only of the order of 3,500 tons, about 1,000 tons being consumed in India and the balance exported, mainly to Ceylon, Java and the Straits Settlements. The official figures for the exports in the fiscal years 1916-17 and 1917-18 are 1,964 tons and 3,643 tons respectively.575. India imports a variety of nitrogen products, but, in general, only in comparatively small quantities, the principal products being mining arid blasting explosives, cyanides, and ammonia and ammonium salts. Figures for the imports of a number of products are given in the following table : Table 66.-INDIAN IMPORTS OP NITROGEN PRODUCTS.Product.

There is an estimated annual production of about 1,700 tons of nitric acid in India from Chile nitrate and potassium nitrate, about two-thirds being made at the Government Cordite Factory.577. The above statistics show that the nitrogen requirements of India have hitherto been quite small, amounting at a maximum to perhaps 1,000 tons of fixed nitrogen per annum.578. Having regard to the primary importance of agriculture to India, it is somewhat remarkable to find that such little progress has been made in the use of artificial fertilisers. According to the evidence available to the Committee, the chief demand is for phosphatic fertilisers and, with the exception of organic compounds such as fish manure, but little nitrogen is used. It is said that the planters and European community generally are fully alive to the value of fertilisers and had taken steps to develop the industry before the war. With regard to the need of, or demand for, nitrogenous fertilsers in India, contrary views have been expressed. On the one hand, it has been said that there is little or no scope for such fertilisers, while on the other, the evidence of more than one witness has been to the effect tliat under favourable conditions as to price there would be an enormous market. The opinion was also expressed that the poverty in India could be greatly alleviated if the natives could be brought to adopt a policy of scientific fertilisation. In many cases an application of nitro-genous manures, such as ammonium sulphate, Chile nitrate, calcium cyanamide and nitrate of lime, has produced an increase per acre in the yield of various Indian crops, but the data at the disposal of the Committee show that in some instances the increases failed to compensate for the cost of the fertiliser employed.579. From a broad review of the situation, the Committee is of the opinion that a country like India, possessing such varied climatic conditions and soils and producing such a variety of crops, must in time provide an outlet for very large quantities of all classes of artificial fertilisers. There is little doubt that a substantial reduction in the price hitherto prevailing for combined nitrogen in India would speedily result in the creation of a large demand.580. With regard to the resources of India, there are large deposits of coal of a somewhat inferior quality, the ash content, on an average, probably amounting to about 10 per cent, as U 6619 H s
a minimum. No deposits of anthracite have yet been opened up. The quantity of coal hitherto utilised under ammonia recovery conditions has been small, as indicated by the data previously given. In the event, however, of the inferior coals being sufficiently high in nitrogen and also capable of being mined cheaply, there exists the possibility of utilising them in recovery gas-producers for the primary purpose of obtaining by-products, such as ammonium sulphate, as is being done at the present time in Natal. There are abundant supplies of limestone in India, and a table of analyses-available to the Committee indicates that in numerous cases the content of calcium carbonate ranges from 95 to 99 per cent, and over. Some of these limestones appear to.be of a quality suitable for the manufacture of high-grade carbide for lighting or welding purposes. It should be noted, however, that the Committee&apos;s investigations point to the conclusion that for the manufacture of calcium cyanamide, as distinct from high-grade carbide, the quality of the raw materials need not necessarily be so high as has hitherto been supposed. It is, possible,, therefore, that varieties of limestone not adapted for carbide making alone might prove to be suitable for the manufacture of calcium cyanamide, small quantities of which are already imported into India. There is also a moderate demand for calcium carbide, the imports of which have varied between 640 and 1,100 tons per annum during the past six years.581. The water power possibilities in India are considerable and several large powers have already been developed, the most notable being the Khopoli (Tata) scheme in Bombay (100,000 e.h.p.), the undertaking of the Mysore Government on the River Cauvery (22,000 e.h.p.) and the River Jhelum scheme in Kashmir (20,000 e.h.p.). Besides the Khopoli scheme in the Western Ghats, another large power is being developed at the Andhra Valley, and investi-gations have shown that a third power approximating to 300,000 continuous horse-power could be developed by harnessing the Koyna river, the three schemes together promising a continuous supply of over 500,000 h.p. In regard to the Cauvery scheme, a large dam is imder construc-tion which will increase the power to about 40,000 e h.p., and this will not only meet the needs of the Kolar Gold Mines and of Mysore and Bangalore, but also provide a surplus of perhaps 15,000 e.h.p. for new industries and furnish a large supply of water for irrigation purposes. The.undeveloped water powers in the province of Mysore are estimated at over 100,000 e.h.p., and still larger amounts of power could be developed if use could be found for an intermittent supply during eight or nine months of the year. The. information furnished to the Committee indicates that there are also considerable water power resources in Ceylon. In general, it is important to remember that the question of water for irrigation is a vital consideration in India, and that in many cases this aspect of the water problem will impose a limitation upon developments that would otherwise be capable of furnishing large supplies of power. There&apos; is no doubt that blocks of power adequate for nitrogen fixation purposes could be developed in many parts of India, but their economic value in this connection will be largely determined by factors such as the cost of development, the availability of raw materials and the situation of the nearest potential markets.582. The Indian Munitions Board and the Government of. Mysore have investigated in considerable detail the possibilities of establishing the manufacture of calcium carbide and calcium cyanamide upon a scale commensurate with the probable requirements of India in the immediate future. The results of these investigations have been, communicated confidentially to the Committee, which has been in a position to furnish a considerable amount of supple-mentary information upon various aspects of the question. The. prospects of manufacturing the above products economically under Indian conditions appear to be somewhat uncertain owing to the quality of the. raw materials at hand and to ,depend largely upon the availability of a suitable form of carbon. Before proceeding to a manufacturing scale it would clearly be sound policy to determine the influence of the above factors by the operation of a trial unit of plant of a sufficient size to afford reliable practical data. The Committee understands that there is a possibility of this course being adopted in Mysore.NEW ZEALAND.583. The Committee furnished the Dominion Government with a memorandum indicating the nature of the information that would prove of special utility in considering the general bearing of the nitrogen problem in relation to the particular requirements of New Zealand ; unfortunately, the desired data have not come to hand. The information summarised below has been compiled by the Committee mainly from the official publications of the Dominion Government.584. The coal deposits in New Zealand appear to constitute the only home source of combined nitrogen. Figures are not available for the quantities of ammonia recovered, but the statistics for the gas industry in the year 1910-11 indicate that the value of all the residuals recovered at gasworks, with the exception of tar, only amounted to  1,349.
585. The principal nitrogen products imported into New Zealand are mining and blasting-explosives, cyanides, guano and anhydrous ammonia, but there is also a small demand for other forms of combined nitrogen, as is shown by the following incomplete statistics : Table 67.-IMPORTS OF NITROGEN PRODUCTS INTO NEW ZEALAND.Products.	\,        Quantities in Tons.					1912.	&apos; 1913.	1914.	1915.	1916.Mining and blasting explosives -	843	868	828	1,001	753f Potassium and sodium cyanides -Anhydrous ammonia*      -     -     -Saltpetre......

Small quantities of nitric acid and sulphuric acid were also imported, the annual figures for the latter product being from 500 to 600 tons.586. The nitrogen requirements of New Zealand, as revealed by the above statistics, have -hitherto been small, amounting perhaps to a maximum of about 2,000 tons of fixed nitrogen per annum.   A growing demand for anhydrous ammonia for the refrigerating industry appears to be indicated, although allowance must be made for the increase in the value of the product during the wrar.587. In regard to agriculture, the principal demand is for phosphatic fertilisers, as shown by the following figures for the imports during the years 1914-16 : Table 68.

With the exception of guano, nitrogenous fertilisers have only been employed to a small extent, as is apparent from previous figures. The Committee has no data as to the comparative value of different artificial fertilisers under the conditions prevailing in New Zealand, but experiments appear to have been in progress, judging by the importation of small quantities of calcium cyanamide and nitrate of lime.589. Information is not available to the Committee concerning the estimated coal resources of the Dominion, which are said to comprise a deposit or deposits of anthracite. - The output, of coal, however, in each of the years 1914 and 1915, amounted to about 2&apos;2 million tons The latest published figures show that in the year ending March 31st, 1911, about 161,000 tons of coal were carbonised at gasworks, and about 20,000 tons were used in electric power stations. The Dominion also imported coal and small quantities of coke, the figures for the former amounting to 511,451 tons and 347,552 tons in the years 1914 and 1915 respectively. The Committee has no specific data as to the extent and quality of the limestone deposits in New Zealand, but it is stated that great quantities of pure limestone exist in both islands.H i
590. The Dominion is exceptionally favoured in. regard to water power resources, the available power being estimated at approximately 4 million b.h.p. Owing to the configura-tion of the islands, the potential value of many of the powers is increased by reason of their proximity to deep water, although at the present time existing industrial centres are somewhat remote from a number of the larger powers. Nearly 40,000 h.p. has already been developed, and of this, some three-quarters is employed for electricity supply purposes, the remainder being absorbed&apos; by mining and refrigerating works, various classes of mills, and so on. There is little doubt that it would be possible to develop considerable blocks of power at a cost which would be quite favourable for nitrogen fixation purposes. The estimated cost for one scheme situated near deep water, inclusive of allowances for con-contingencies, is as low as one-fiftieth of a penny per unit, equivalent to about 15s. per full kw.-year.SOUTH AFRICA.591. The Government guano islands off the western and southern coastline of South Africa have hitherto constituted the principal home source of combined nitrogen, the recovery of ammonia nitrogen from coal being quite a recent development in the Union. Although, deposits of nitrates have been reported in the more arid districts, they have proved upon examination to be of no importance. The yield of guano from the Government islands during the years 1911-16 is indicated in the following table: Q 1 Table 69.-SOUTH AFRICAN PRODUCTION OF GUANO.Item.

The guano sold during the years 1914-16 contained on an average 10&apos;66 per cent, of nitrogen, and on account of the limited supply and of the large and increasing local demand,, its export beyond the limits of the Union has not been permitted.592. The quantity of ammonia nitrogen recovered from coal is at present quite small, the entire output being obtained at a single works in Natal which came into operation at the end of 1916. At this installation a somewhat inferior coal, which is near the surface and cheaply mined, is gasified in recovery producers for the sole purpose of obtaining by-products, the surplus power gas being wasted. The production quickly attained the rate of 2,500 tons of ammonium sulphate per annum and was expected to be doubled in a short time. About three-quarters of the output was exported to Mauritius.593. The most important of the nitrogen products imported into South Africa are Chile nitrate, and cyanides for use in gold-mining, but small quantities of ammonium salts, guano, and nitric acid are also imported as indicated by the following incomplete figures which have been supplied to the Committee : Table 70.-SOUTH AFRICAN IMPORTS OF NITROGEN PRODUCTS.Product.

NITROGEN FIXATION IN SOUTH AFRICA.117594. Chile nitrate is used almost exclusively as a raw material for the manufacture of mining explosives, the principal nitrogen industry in South Africa, and the statistics furnished to the Committee indicate that the consumption for other purposes, such as agriculture, is probably less than 100 tons per annum. The annual requirements of the explosives industry itself, however, account for about 2(1,000 to 27,000 tons. The cost of the nitrate at the coast, where two large explosives factories are situated, is practically the same as in the United Kingdom, but the cost of freight to Johannesburg, where a third large factory is situated, represents an addition of some  4 or  5 per ton. There have been no imports of explosives into South Africa for some years past, and the home industry not only provides the whole of the local requirements but also permits of the maintenance of a fairly large export trade. The exports in 1911, 1913 and 1916 were 202, 529 and 6,393 short tons respectively. During the war, it has been necessary to resort to the use of ammonium nitrate to supplement the supplies of nitroglycerine, and the view was expressed to the Committee that ammonium nitrate has come to stay as an ingredient of mining explosives.595. To sum up, it appears that the nitrogen requirements of South Africa have hitherto been relatively small, amounting perhaps to 6,000 or 7,000 tons of fixed nitrogen per annum,596. With regard to the requirements of agriculture, the fertilisers principally in demand are superphosphates, guano, bone manures and basic slag. The consumption of nitrogenous fertilisers, other than guano, is quite small, and the Committee was informed tliat experiments conducted over a number of years have shown that small benefit accrued from their use. It was pointed out, however, that there was a prospect of an increased use of ammonium sulphate when the productiveness of the sugar lands diminished, and that the general position might be materially altered if the price of sulphate fell, say, to  7 per ton.597. Dealing next with the resources of the Union from the point of view of nitrogen recovery and fixation, it may be noted in the first place that there are considerable deposits of coal in all of the Provinces. The extent of the deposits does not appear to have been determined, but there are marked variations in their quality. There has been a steady increase in the annual production, the quantity mined amounting to 7&apos;6 million tons in 1911 and to 10 million tons in 1916. Ammonia nitrogen is recovered from coal at one installation only, as previously mentioned, but a small quantity of coal is also carbonised in Natal for the production of coke, the output of the latter in 1916 amounting to 10,704 tons. The price of coal at the pit&apos;s mouth has remained quite steady over a period of years, except in Natal where the high quality of coal coupled with the growing demands of shipping have had the effect of raising the price from about 5s. 5d. per ton in 19.11 to 7s. 5d. per ton in 1916. In the Transvaal and the Orange Free State, the prices during the years 1911-16 have remained at about 4s. Qd. and 5s. Qd. per ton respectively. With coal capable of being mined at such low costs, the prospects would appear to be favourable to the extension of sulphate recovery by processes such as the gasification of coal in recovery producers, because the more valuable sulphate will stand the cost of carriage., whereas the original coal Avould probably not. The deposits of limestone in the different Provinces of the Union, although of very great extent, are mainly of inferior quality from the point of view of the manufacture of calcium carbide and cyanamide. Magnesian limestone containing up to 40 per cent, of carbonate of magnesia, and desert limestone containing up to 20 per cent, of silica and other impurities, occur in abundance, but deposits capable of furnishing a pure white lime for chemical purposes and for the cyanide works of the Rand occur to a much smaller extent.598. The Committee was informed that the prospects in regard to water power in the Union were not very hopeful, the water power resources being, in the main, in inaccessible districts, so that developments could hardly be considered as within the range of practical possibilities at the present time. There are considerable potential resources in Rhodesia, as at the Victoria Falls, but these are situated at a considerable distance from existing industrial centres.599. The immediate power requirements of South Africa are chiefly met by the use of coal, and the low price of this material in some of the provinces is therefore an important asset. The principal power stations in the Union are those on the Witwatersrand which, in 1914, had a total capacity of approximately 220,000 kw. (295,000 e.h.p.) with a maximum sustained load of about 142,000 kw. (190,000 e.h.p). At some of the larger stations electrical energy is said to be generated at a general cost price of 0&apos;3d. per kw.-hour, the figure for one station probably being nearer 0&apos; 2d. per kw.-hour. The equivalent cost price per full kw.-year would thus amount to about  11 and  7&apos;3 respectively and could not be regarded as favourable for nitrogen fixation purposes. In 1915-16 there were 79 electric light and power generating plants in the Union, with engines having a total capacity of 301,583 h.p., the majority of the plants being of a small or moderate size. In the case of the three largest municipal power stations, namely those of Johannesburg (13,750 kw.), Durban (10,100 kw.), and Cape Town (8,900 kw.), the working costs per unit amounted, respectively to 0&apos;97d., 0&quot;66ci, and 1 - 2Sd. (Official Year Book of the Union, No. 1, 1917). g

In addition there were 178 factories utilising water power, but no information is available as to. the total power thus represented.601. The possibility of developing electro-chemical industries in South Africa, for example, the manufacture of calcium carbide and calcium cyanamide, is dealt with in some detail in a report issued by the Development of Resources Committee of the South African Institute of Electrical Engineers. It is there pointed out that the imports of calcium carbide in 1913 amounted to about 2,600 tons, and estimates are given for the cost of manufacture under South African conditions on scales of, 2,600, 5,000 and 10,000 tons per annum. Further estimates are given for the cost of manufacturing 4,000 tons of calcium cyanamide per annum, and for the probable cost of obtaining pure sodium cyanide from the cyanamide.602. The estimates have been under consideration and compared with the corresponding figures arrived at by the Committee upon the basis of pre-war conditions in the United Kingdom. While detailed comment is perhaps unnecessary, it may be noted that the proposed scales of operation upon which the South African estimates are based are considerably below the minimum economic size, and from the competitive point of view would only be justifiable under special circumstances; Moreover, the figure adopted for the cost of electrical energy is high, and can hardly be regarded as favourable for the purpose in view. With an existing nucleus demand, for products such at calcium carbide, it would probably be sound policy to establish a new electro-chemical industry upon a sufficiently bold scale to ensure the best all-round economy in manufacture, as there is little doubt that the marketing of a cheaper product than hitherto would soon result in an increased demand. The figures quoted in an earlier section of this Report and in an Appendix (Appendix V., Section V.), if modified to suit South African conditions, would provide an indication of the cost of operation on a large scale and of the limiting price that could be afforded for electrical energy.OBSERVATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS.603. The ideal policy would be to make the British Empire independent, during war and peace, of external supplies of all nitrogen products, and the investigations of the Committee point to the definite conclusion that this is practicable. By the extension or adoption in different parts of the Empire of various nitrogen recovery and fixation processes, there is no question that the latent resources in coal and other raw materials, and also in water power, would enable sufficient supplies of all forms of combined nitrogen to be obtained to meet the requirements of war and peace.604. It has been clearly shown in the course of evidence given before the Committee that Canada possesses exceptional water power resources accessible to the seaboard and capable of easy development at a cost probably as low as or even lower than that of the very cheapest Norwegian powers. There is little doubt that various nitrogen products could be produced more cheaply on the Canadian seaboard than at any other world site. In many other parts of the British Empire where cheap water power is being or could be developed, for example in New Zealand, Tasmania, Egypt and India, the manufacture of synthetic nitrogen products could be profitably undertaken. v, ...... -605. In places where very cheap water power can be developed, a nitrate fertiliser might be manufactured at a price that would compete with that of Chile nitrate. In other places where&apos; high-grade limestone and anthracite or other suitable form of carbon can also be obtained, the calcium cyanamide process might prove the best.  It may possibly be objected
NITROGEN FIXATION IN THE BRITISH EMPIRE.119that the Haber process for the synthesis of ammonia, coupled with the ammonia oxidation process, will eventually render all the other fixation processes obsolete, at any rate as far as the production of ammonia, nitric and nitrate nitrogen are concerned. The Committee is satisfied, however, that at a really favourable water power site, nitric and nitrate nitrogen can he produced more cheaply by the arc process than by any other method, and that the calcium cyanamide process at a suitable location can produce a cheaper nitrogenous fertiliser than &apos; any other existing fixation process.606. With regard to nitrogen recovery processes, it may be recalled that there are very large deposits of low-grade coal in various parts of the Empire, for example, in Australia, South Africa and India, which can be cheaply mined, and constitute potential reserves of ammonia nitrogen. Although the coal itself would probably not stand the cost of transport, the same consideration would not apply to more valuable products such as ammonium sulphate. It is possible, therefore, that such coals could be utilised primarily for the recovery of by-products, as is already being done in Natal, thus conserving the higher grades of coal for other purposes. With cheap sources of by-product ammonia of this character, the local demands for nitric nitrogen and perhaps nitrate nitrogen might be met by resorting to the ammonia oxidation process.607. The evidence given before the Committee indicates that the local demand for nitrogenous fertilisers in different parts of the Empire is still comparatively small, but there is no doubt that the growing calls upon agriculture will bring about an important modification in this respect in the course of a few years, and there is much evidence to show that if cheap supplies of fixed nitrogen were available a large demand would soon arise. The investigations of the Committee into the cost of manufacture of synthetic nitrogen products prove that cheap supplies are practicable in several parts of the Empire.608. So long as nitric acid and ammonia could not be made synthetically, the various portions of the British Empire were in a far better position than other countries owing to the maritime supremacy of the United Kingdom. The situation, however, was fundamentally changed directly it was proved to be commercially practicable to manufacture the above products synthetically ; Germany, having prepared herself by developing several synthetic processes, was in a very strong position at the outbreak of war, whereas Great Britain, having continued to rely upon the older non-synthetic processes, was confronted with a position having every element of risk.      . 1609. In the light of the lessons recently learned, it is hardly too strong to state this country cannot afford the risk of dependence upon Chile in the future, apart from the possibility of Chile being unable to produce- supplies of nitrate on account of internal conditions, or of herself becoming a belligerent.   &apos;610. It is clear that Imperial preparedness for defence will be one of the vital problems to be faced on the conclusion of peace. From the military point of view it would probably be wise to concentrate the major portion of the nucleus defensive installations in the United Kingdom. The existence of supplementary installations in other parts of the Empire, however, would clearly be essential, because no portion should be in a position of entire - dependence upon external supplies if confronted with another emergency.. 611. Imperial defence is too vital a matter to be made subservient to commercial or even purely domestic requirements, but in framing a policy due consideration should be given to the claims of both.612. From a broad review of the situation, it appears to the Committee that a wise policy in regard to defence could to a very large extent be made a sound economic policy. The nucleus installations established in different parts of the Empire would at first perhaps be more than adequate for supplying the immediate local demands for nitrogenous fertilisers, and possibly blasting and mining explosives. It is safe, however, to predict that in the course of a few years the local demands would absorb the whole output of the installations constituting the defensive measures of the Empire.613. The risk of sea transit still remains to be considered. In this connection it must be observed that it would have been of enormous advantage to the United Kingdom and the Allies during the present war if nitrogen fixation installations had been in operation on a substantial scale on the eastern seaboard of Canada. Even assuming a parity in the maritime risks, there is no question as to the saving in tonnage and in time that would have resulted from the availability of supplies of nitrogen products and explosives on the Canadian seaboard, as compared with reliance upon Chile for practically the entire requirements for nitrates.614. Before a definite policy could be framed, it would be necessary for an Imperial Authority to make a careful study of the defensive requirements of the component parts and of! the Empire as a whole, with due regard to the contingencies that might have to be faced Having done so, a decision could be made as to the portions of the Empire most suitable for the establishment of installations which would form a nucleus for the necessary supplies.
Xin-SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.G15. Having reviewed in detail the various aspects of the nitrogen problem, it is desirable to summarise the principal conclusions already arrived at, and to supplement them with some further observations and conclusions in regard to specific points and to the problem as a whole. It is necessary to refer again to the fact that the Committee, in dealing with questions of costs and prices, has adopted pre-icar conditions as the only satisfactory basis of comparison (par. 31). Owing to the constant fluctuations in the rates of wages and in the prices of materials during the war, and to the certainty of a period of unsettled conditions on the conclusion of peace, it has only been possible to deal with the post-war prospects of the nitrogen industries by making the broad assumptions that all the manufacturing countries will have been similarly affected by the war, and that their relative positions as regards international competition can be approximately gauged by a comparison based upon pre-war conditions (par. 438).THE WORLITS DEMAND AND PRODUCTION.616. Dealing in the first place with the demand for and production of nitrogen compounds before the war, it has been shown that:  (a) The world&apos;s consumption in 1913 was practically double that in 1903 (par. 90).(b) Practically the whole of the world&apos;s demand was met by the Chilean nitrate and by-product ammonia industries, the nitrogen fixation industries, notwithstanding their notable development during the period 1903-13, contributing a relatively&apos;:      insignificant proportion of the world&apos;s supplies (pars. 80 and 90).(c) The market price of combined nitrogen before the war was governed by that of Chile nitrate, and, although exhibiting considerable fluctuations, was characterised by a general upward tendency (Tables 3 and 5, and par. 90).It may be inferred, therefore, that the supply was at any rate not in excess of the demand.(d) The nitrogen fixation industries, although in their infancy, were in a position to place synthetic products upon the market before the war at prices competing favourably with the current prices of nitrate and ammonia nitrogen (par. 90).When regard is had to the costs incurred in developing and extending new industries, the above fact points to comparatively moderate production costs under the conditions prevailing in the countries where the synthetic compounds were manufactured.617. The war has been responsible for profound modifications in the relative positions of the nitrogen industries, the special combination of circumstances characterising the war having led to an enormous expansion of the nitrogen fixation processes. It has been shown that: (a) The estimated productive capacity of the nitrogen fixation installations repre-sented about 10 per cent, of the world&apos;s supplies of combined nitrogen in 1914 and has grown to about 28 per cent, at the present time (Table 52 and par. 412).(b) The post-war production of ammonium sulphate, both synthetic and by-product, may account for about 39 per cent, of the world&apos;s supplies of fixed nitrogen, as compared with a figure of 41 per cent, for Chile nitrate (pars. 412 and 445).(c) The supremacy of the Chilean nitrate industry is already being challenged on account of the war developments, and the near future holds out the prospect that the market price of ammonium sulphate or of synthetic products may govern that of Chile nitrate instead of following it as hitherto (pars. 413 and 445).(d) The post-war supply of fixed nitrogen potentially available for the world&apos;s requirements is likely to be of the order of 1,000,000 metric tons or over per annum, an increase of from 30 to 40 per cent, upon the pre-war production (par. 409).(e) The total increase in the world&apos;s productive capacity during the war period does not appear to be greater than woidd, have been the case under normal conditions had the ordinary rate of growth in consmnptian in the pre-war period been maintained during the last four years (pars. 410 and 445).It is perhaps a matter for surprise that the total increase has not been greater, in accordance with general impressions of the &quot;position. The explanation is clearly seen to be that there has been a relatively small expansion of the two major industries during the war, the great development having been confined to synthetic processes which were only responsible for an insignificant proportion of the world&apos;s supplies before the war.618. From the above figures and from observations set out later, it appears that the question of over-production, which was raised in evidence given before the Committee, is hardly likely to constitute a serious factor in the post-war situation.
NITROGEN PRODUCTS IN AGRICULTURE.619. Dealing next with, the uses of nitrogen products, it has been pointed out that: (a) A minimum of perhaps 70 per cent, of the world&apos;s total supplies of nitrate and ammonia nitrogen was utilised in agriculture prior to the war (pars. 46 and 65).(b) Practically the whole of the relatively small output of synthetic nitrogen products prior to the war was also used in agriculture (pars. 76 and 80).The fertiliser market thus constituted by far the most important outlet for nitrogen products.(c) There is no question as to the utility of the new synthetic fertilisers (pars.77, 78, and 477). Their general effects, however, as compared with the effects of Chile nitrate and ammonium sulphate, are far from being completely determined on account of the necessarily limited experience in their use (pars. 82 and 89).(d) Notwithstanding the variations in the comparative fertilising values of the different non-synthetic and synthetic products (pars. 81 flftd*89), each, form of combined nitrogen has a special value in particular circumstances (par. 477).(e) The consumption of artificial nitrogenous fertilisers before the war was extremely localised, four countries alone accounting for as much as 70 to 80 per cent, of the woiid&apos;s consumption of Chile nitrate, and two countries alone for about 60 per cent, of the world&apos;s consumption of ammonium sulphate (pars. 45 and 64).(/) When account is taken of the relative areas under cultivation in the food-producing countries of the world, of the pre-war consumption of nitrogenous fertilisers in the most progressive of the agricultural countries, and of the corresponding con-sumption in the remaining countries, it is abundantly clear that the quantities of nitrogenous manures employed were in many cases below the most advantageous or profitable level (par. 404).     *It must be remembered, in this connection, that in some countries there had been a rapid increase in the area of virgin soil brought under cultivation, and although a diminution in productiveness was becoming apparent in a number of cases (pars. 343 and 558), the immediate need for artificial fertilisation had not been recognised.- 620. During the war, the demand for explosives has been imperative, and the needs of agriculture have been relegated to a secondary position because the nitrogen industries, notwithstanding their large expansion, have been unable to cope with the double demand for explosives and fertilisers (pars. 342-3).   It has further been pointed out that: (a) The diversion of a large proportion of fixed nitrogen to munitions for a period of several years has been to the great detriment of the world&apos;s food supply (par. 475). In consequence of this and of other factors (par. 343), the scale of subsistence in many countries has been reduced far below the pre-war level (par. 475).(b) The food problem has become the most important consideration for all the belligerents (par. 343).(c) The difficulties experienced during the war period in obtaining supplies have already provided a salutary lesson as to the importance of fertilisation (par. 404), and the vital, importance of nitrogenous manures has received almost universal recognition (pars. 403 and 475).(d) The imperative need for maintaining and extending the world&apos;s production of food (par. 403), and the wider recognition of the value of fertilisers, will lead to a large increase in the demand&apos; for nitrogenous manures in countries where the con-sumption has hitherto been very small in proportion to the area under cultivation (par. 404).(e) The visible demand for nitrogenous fertilisers in a number of countries is already considerably in excess of the pre-war consumption (pars. 445 and 452).(/) In the opinion of the Committee, which is supported by much evidence, the provision of a really cheap supply of fixed nitrogen, say, at  40 to  45 per metric ton, or 8s. to 9s. per unit and the figures given in a previous section of the Report show that this should be possible even under post-war conditions would lead to a greatly extended consumption of combined nitrogen (par. 404), and to an even greater rate of increase in the demand than formerly (par. 445).RELATIVE COSTS OF SYNTHETIC AND NON-SYNTHETIC PROCESSES.621. The Committee washes to draw, special attention to the tables of cost (Tables 35 and 36) in the Report, in which it is shown that, under favourable conditions in regard to the cost of power and of raw materials, the nitrogeA fixation and allied processes, speaking broadly, stand at a very considerable advantage as compared with non-synthetic methods. Upon the basis of pre-war market prices and factory costs (par 32), it has been pointed out that :-(a) The market price of a metric ton of combined nitrogen in the United Kingdom before the war (average 1911-13) was  67 and  66 in the forms of Chile nitrate and ammonium sulphate respectively (pars. 44,-62, and 107).
(b) The synthetic processes can produce a metric ton of combined nitrogen at a cost, at the factory, of from  2.0 to  30 (Table 35 and par. 267).(c) The lowest recorded market price in the United Kingdom for a metric ton of combined nitrogen (as ammonium sulphate) was  35&apos;8 in 1897 (par. 107).(d) The synthetic processes can produce a metric ton of concentrated (93 to 96 per cent.) nitric acid for about half the cost by the Chile nitrate retort process (par. 238).(e) The ammonia oxidation, process, even when utilising by-product ammonia charged at its full pre-war market price and allowing for the costs and losses incurred in the concentration and purification of the ammonia, is capable of producing concen: trated nitric acid at a lower&apos; cost than the Chile nitrate retort process (par. 233).(/) The synthetic processes can produce a metric ton of combined nitrogen ready for the fertiliser market (as calcium cyanamide or ammonium sulphate) at a cost, at the factory, of about, or even less than, one-half of the pre-war market price of combined nitrogen in the United Kingdom (pars. 212, 225, and Table 35).\y) The synthetic processes, with the exception of the arc process at a very favourable water power site, are not at the present time in a position to produce nitrate fertilisers at a sufficiently low cost to face the possible competition of Chile nitrate(pars. 203, 235, and 246).This position may, hoAvever, be altered by the development of more economical methods of recovering oxides of nitrogen in the form of nitrate salts (par. 267). In this connection, special attention may be directed to the dry and wet absorption processes previously referred to in this Report (pars. 204 and J37).(h) The capital expenditure incurred in installing the synthetic processes is not excessive, being somewhat less than, or on a parity with, the pre-war market value of the annual production, except in the case of the arc process for which the outlay is nearly twice the market value of the annual production (pars. 200, 211, 214, 224, and Table 36).THE INTERNATIONAL SITUATION AFTER THE WAR.622. When account is taken of the great expansion of the synthetic processes during the war and of the general economic conditions confronting the various nations at the termination of the war, it appears, in the light of previous observations and assumptions, that: (a) There will probably be ample scope in the post-war markets for all forms of nitrogenous fertilisers, both non-synthetic and synthetic (par. 445;.(6) The industrial demand for nitric acid is likely to be met in the future by means of synthetic processes, which show to considerable advantage as compared with the Chile nitrate retort process (pars. 238, 436, and 445).(c) The marketing of large quantities of synthetic ammonium sulphate and calcium cyanamide as the result of further developments of the Haber and cyanamicle processes must influence the future price of combined nitrogen, and may even control it (pars. 441 and 445).(d) The producers of combined nitrogen may eventually have to face a competitive price of perhaps  7 or  8 per metric ton for ammonium sulphate and  6 or  7 per metric ton for cyanamide (pars. 439-40, and 445).... (e) The Chilean nitrate industry, in order to hold its position against the cheapestsynthetic fertilisers, may be faced with the necessity of making substantial reductions . in price, perhaps to a figure of  8 per ton or even less (pars. 441 and 445).(/) With regard to nitrate fertilisers, however, the Chilean industry will probably be able to hold the market against the synthetic processes (pars. 246, 417, and 445), at any rate until, more economical methods have been devised for the direct production. -    . of nitrate salts from oxides of nitrogen (par. 267).(g) The by-product ammonia industry, while capable of meeting the competition of synthetic products by raising, within&apos;limits, the prices of coal gas, coke, benzol, tar, etc., to compensate for a fall in the price of sulphate, may be faced with the necessity of making substantial reductions in the price of sulphate, perhaps to a figure approximating to the lowest market price hitherto recorded in the United Kingdom (pars. 242,430, 439).Qi) From the point of view of international competition, the relative positions of the different countries may be modified to an important extent by the cost of labour and materials and more particularly by the world shortage of shipping.   As long as the shortage exists, it will operate to the substantial advantage of producers who have a i       local market available (par. 445), and will constitute a serious handicap t&apos;o the Chilean :\k    industry with its entire dependence on distant markets (par. 416).(i) The economic and financial position of Germany during the years succeeding the Avar, and the essential need of nitrate fertilisers for restoring her agriculture, may induce or even compel that country to resort to the manufacture of synthetic nitrates. The Chilean industry may thus be faced with the partial or even total loss of the . ... German market, which \vas the largest individual market for nitrate before the war (pars.416, and 436).
THE POSITION IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.623, Considering in the next place the pre-war position of the United Kingdom in relation to the production of and demand for combined nitrogen, it has been shown that(a) Before the war, the United Kingdom produced and exported large quantities of ammonia nitrogen, but depended entirely upon imported products for all requirements in respect of nitrate and nitric nitrogen (pars. 91-5, and 380).(6) There was practically an uninterrupted expansion in the exports of ammonia nitrogen during the period 1903-13 (Table 18), upwards of 70 per cent, of the total home production being exported annually (par. 95).(c) The British export trade in ammonium sulphate was larger than that of any other country in the world (par, 467).(d) The United Kingdom was a relatively small consumer of all forms of fixed nitrogen (pars. 95, and 380).\e) Agriculture accounted for the largest portion of the home consumption of fixed nitrogen, but the figure only represented 23&apos;5 per cent, of the total home production and importation of combined nitrogen, one-half being in the form of Chile nitrate (Table 21 and par. 105).(/) In proportion to the total area under cultivation in the United Kingdom, the annual consumption of artificial nitrogenous fertilisers was smaller than that in other progressive agricultural countries, such as Germany (par. 448).It must be remembered, however, that, the general conditions in the two countries in regard to arable and grass land were different. Moreover, the extensive use of feeding stuffs in the United Kingdom served largely to supply the necessary combined nitrogen (pars. 106, and 448-50).624. The position of the United Kingdom after four years of war exhibits some features which are discouraging and others which are full of promise for the immediate future. It has been pointed out that: (a) The home production of ammonia nitrogen exhibited a decline during the years 1914 and 1915, a recovery in the year 1916, and a moderate increase in the year 1917, amounting to about 6 per cent, on the output in 1913 (Table 48 and par. 383).The estimated output of by-product ammonia in the United States in 1917 is more than double the output in 1913 and is not far short of the British production in. 1917 (Table 40). The estimated output of by-product and synthetic ammonia in Germany in 1917 is more than double the output in 1913, (Tables 40 and 42).In the face of these figures, it is disquieting to note that the output from the by-product ammonia industries in the United Kingdom has remained practically stationary during the war.(b) The export trade in ammonium sulphate was largely maintained in the years 1914-16, but practically ceased in 1917 on account of the increasing home demands &apos;(Table 48 and par. 467).In this connection it must be noted that there has been rapid progress during the war in the output of by-product ammonia and in the manufacture of synthetic nitrogen compounds in countries which were formerly large importers of ammonium sulphate from the United Kingdom (par. 469).(c) The war situation has been responsible for a remarkable development in agriculture in the United Kingdom, and the demand for artificial nitrogenous fertilisers at the present time is already more than double the pre-war demand (pars. 452-3).This development has been favoured by the fact that the selling price of sulphate has been controlled by the Government since the latter part of 1916.Actually, the demand has been in excess of the supply, because the available supplies of Chile nitrate have been devoted to the manufacture of munitions, and the only alternative source, namely, the by-product ammonia industries, has also been called upon to furnish a substantial contribution of fixed nitrogen for the production of explosives (par. 452).(d) The industrial demand for nitrogen products has also increased during the war, but the total demand in this direction (exclusive of the requirements for explosives) has been far less than, that of agriculture (pars. 461-6 and Table 54).POST-WAR PROSPECTS OF THE UNITED KINGDOM.625. After a careful consideration of the prospects after the war, and on the assumption that the future requirements for munitions will not exceed the pre-war demand, the Committee has arrived at the following conclusions in regard to the probable order of the post-war demand for fixed nitrogen in the United Kingdom and to the potentialities of the export trade in ammonium sulphate :--(a) The industrial demand for nitrogen products at the termination of the war is likely to be 20 per cent, greater, and the possible demand in the near future 50 per
cent, greater than the average (1911-13) pre-war requirements, which amounted to 20,000 metric tons of fixed nitrogen per annum (pars. -161-6 and Table 54).(6) The agricultural demand at the present time is already more than double the average pre-war requirements, which amounted to about 25,000 metric tons of fixed nitrogen (Table 21). On the assumption that the present scale of food production will be at least maintained, the possible demand in the near future represents a quadrupling of the average pre-war requirements (pars. 458-9 and Table 54).Agricultural developments of a much wider character have been advocated by the Agricultural Policy Sub-Committee of the Reconstruction Committee (Cd. 9079, 1918, previously quoted).(c) During the &quot;war, fanners in this country have been obliged to rely almost exclusively upon ammonium sulphate in the absence of available supplies of other nitrogenous fertilisers (par. 452). Although ammonium sulphate, by reason of its slower actioii, could not be expected to displace nitrate fertilisers (par. 460), the extended use of the former product and the experience thus gained have undoubtedly resulted in the creation of a much larger potential market at home.(d) The export trade in ammonium sulphate will have to be re-established in the face of shipping difficulties, of the partial or total loss of former large customers, and of the potential competition of other producers (pars. 468-9). In the judgment of the Committee, and for reasons which have already been summarised (pars. 619-20), the&apos; demand in external markets will be more than adequate to absorb ammonium sulphate on the pre-war (average 1911-13) scale of exportation, i.e., the equivalent of 61,000 metric tons of fixed nitrogen per annum (Table 20). Allowing for the loss of former markets and for the unsettled conditions following the conclusion of peace, the Committee estimates that the potential export trade immediately after the war may be about 40 per cent, less than the pre-war average figure, but that the possible trade in the near future will be on a paritv with that carried on before the war (par. 475 and Table 54).(e) The pre-war exports of ammonia nitrogen were almost entirely in the form of ammonium sulphate for use in agriculture in other countries (Table 20), and the extent of the export trade after the war is obviously dependent upon the ability of British producers to. compete on favourable terms with other exporting countries (pars. 468-75).(/) The national interests demand that an abundant and cheap supply of nitro-genous fertilisers should be available, not only for the agricultural requirements of the United Kingdom, but also for export to other food-producing countries (par. 474).(g) If advantage is taken of the possibilities in home and external markets, there is undoubtedly the prospect of a valuable accession to the trade of the United Kingdom in ammonia fertilisers. The markets at home and abroad, however, can only be main-tained and extended by resorting to every possible method of cheapening the production of such fertilisers (pars. 471-4), because the increasing competition of synthetic products will have to be faced in the near future.The cost of fixing a pure strong ammonia, e.g., synthetic ammonia, on a large scale for the production of ammonium sulphate packed for the market amounts to about  8&apos;6 per metric ton of ammonia nitrogen, or  175 per metric ton of sulphate obtained, even when the best modern sulphuric acid plant is employed. The cost is still greater in the case of by-product ammonia, ranging under the most favourable conditions to from  2*5 to  3 per metric ton of sulphate according to the system of recovery adopted (pars. 60, 61, and 241).PROBLEMS TO BE FACED.626. It has been pointed out that the post-war policy advocated in another Report (Cd. 8894 previously quoted) does not offer the prospect of cheaper supplies of sulphuric acid than hitherto, and that failing cheaper acid from existing or potential sources, a solution to the pro-blem of reducing the cost of fixing ammonia must be sought in other directions (pars. 471-74). Of the various methods that have been proposed for achieving this object, special mention may be made of the following : -(a) The employment at gasworks and coke-ovens of sulphate recovery processes which depend upon the utilisation of the sulphur compounds contained in the gases and not upon sulphuric acid itself (Appendix V., Section If.).(b) The decomposition of gypsum in suspension by the conjoint action of ammonia and carbon dioxide, thereby producing ammonium sulphate without the use of sulphuric acid itself (Appendix V., Section IV.).(c) The absorption of ammonia in a solution of nitre cake (acid sodium sulphate).(d) The absorption of ammonia in superphosphate, thereby producing a mixture of ammonium sulphate and tri-basic calcium phosphate. Owing to the fine state rf division of the latter, it is said to act like soluble phosphate.
627. There has always been a certain amount ol prejudice against the use of ammonium sulphate, and this has not been without foundation on account of the impure character of the product and of its acidity, the latter having a deleterious action in the soil and a destructive effect upon the bags in which the sulphate is marketed (par, 460). Tho attention of the manufacturers had been directed before the war to the need for improvement in these direc-tions, and a process had been devised for achieving the end. With the prospect of the increasing competition of pure synthetic ammonium sulphate, it is clear that serious efforts must be made to market a purer by-product sulphate than formerly.INDEPENDENCE OF EXTERNAL SUPPLIES OF FIXED NITROGEN.628. Until recent times, every nation was dependent upon Chile for the essential nitrogen products required for military purposes. The position, however, is certain to be profoundly modified in the future, because it has been demonstrated in the most significent manner during the course of the war that: (a) Very serious risks and very heavy costs are involved in relying upon overseas shipment of raw materials (pars. 398-400), even when a nation possesses maritime supremacy.(6)&apos; Given sufficient nucleus plant and experience of nitrogen fixation processes, it is possible to dispense with Chile nitrate and to meet the enormous requirements of modern warfare by synthetic methods alone (par. 386).629. When provision comes to be made to safeguard the future, the lessons learned in the war will strongly influence nations towards a policy either of rendering themselves independent of external supplies of nitrogen compounds or at least of making sufficient provision in the way of nucleus installations to permit of rapid extension in the case of emergency (par. 387).630. Dealing in the first place with the broad question of the future independence of the United Kingdom without special reference to military requirements and upon the assumption that the present scale of food production will be at least maintained, it has been shown that: (a) The estimated visible demands of agriculture, industry and the export trade on the conclusion of peace represent the equivalent of 120,000 metric tons of fixed nitrogen per annum (Tables 54 and 55).(b) The estimated possible demands of agriculture, industry and the export trade in the near future represent the equivalent of 190,000 metric tons of fixed nitrogen per annum (Tables 54 and 55).(c) The largest quantity of fixed nitrogen hitherto produced in the United Kingdom from home sources was 94,000 metric tons in 1917 (Table 48, and par. 477).(d) A policy directed towards independence of external supplies would necessitate the production in the United Kingdom of forms of combined nitrogen not hitherto obtained from home sources (par. 478).(e) If reliance were placed upon by-product ammonia to the fullest possible extent, for example by resorting to the ammonia oxidation process for supplies of nitric and nitrate nitrogen, the home production of by-product nitrogen would have to be increased to 125,000 metric tons per annum as a first stage, and subsequently to 182,000 metric tons per annum for meeting the estimated visible demands on. the conclusion of peace and the estimated possible demands in the near future respectivelv (par. 479).In other words, the scale of production attained in 1917, namely, the equivalent of about 466,000 metric tons of ammonium sulphate, would require to be augmented by the equivalent of 155,000 metric tons of ammonium sulphate per annum at an early date and by the equivalent of 440,000 metric tons in the near future, corresponding to increases of about 33 percent, and 100 per cent, upon the recorded output of 1917 (par. 531).631. The Committee has considered in detail the extent of the home resources in nitrogen-bearing materials, such as coal, shale, peat, and sewage. It has been shown that the actual and potential resources of by-product nitrogen, in the United Kingdom are, beyond doubt, adequate for meeting a demand of almost any magnitude (par. 534). On the question as to how far it would be feasible or economical to rely entirely upon such resources for all home demands the following conclusions have already been indicated, namely : (a) An immediate increase in the home production of ammonia nitrogen can only be looked for in the case of the illuminating gas and producer-gas industries, the adverse influence of war conditions having, in effect, created a potential margin of productive capacity at gasworks and recovery producer installations. Beyond an annual increase of perhaps 10,000 tons of ammonium sulphate from these sources, there appears to be no other prospect of a substantial immediate addition to the home production (pars. 496, 503, and 532).U  6619 I
(6) In tlie course of time, however, substantial increases may be expected from the existing by-product ammonia industries as the result of developments spread over a period of years (pars. 496, 501-2, 505, and 533).(c) The process of carbonising coal at a low temperature cannot be disregarded as a potential factor in the nitrogen situation, although it is difficult, in the present state of knowledge, to draw definite conclusions as to its future prospects (pars. 511, 533). Little or no reliance can be placed upon peat and sewage for the production of any consider-able quantities of marketable nitrogen products, although some reservation is perhaps necessary in the case of sewage (pars. 521, 530, and 533).Even if successful methods were devised for carbonising coal at a low temperature, or for utilising peat or sewage, many years would be required to bring about develop-&apos; ments on a scale sufficient to have a material effect upon the home production of fixed nitrogen (par. 535).(d) On account of economical and practical factors it would not be sound policy to rely upon a single method for meeting such large requirements as have been indicated (pars. 534-7).(e) While much could be done by the extension and development of by-product recovery processes, a policy directed towards ultimate independence of imported nitrogen products would essentially involve the establishment in the United Kingdom of nitrogen fixation upon a large scale (par. 538).In this connection it may be recalled that the Agricultural Policy Sub-Committee ofthe Reconstruction Committee (Cd. 9079, previously quoted) has said (par. 454): All sources of nitrogen supply must be tapped to the fullest extent, and we hope that the resources at our command in the matter of nitrogenous fertilisers may be so developed as to render this country, in the event of a future war, independent of foreign supplies. It is only in recent years that means have been found for combining atmospheric nitrogen in a form suitable  or application as manure, but experience in other countries has amply demonstrated the possibilities that lie in this direction.632. Regarding the military aspects of the question of independence of external supplies of essential nitrogen products, it is clear that the problem facing the United Kingdom, which is already a producer of large quantities of ammonia nitrogen but is not favoured with water poAvers of large magnitude, is to assure home supplies of nitric and nitrate nitrogen. Prior to the war, the arc process was the only fully established alternative to the retort (Chile nitrate) process for the production of nitric acid (par. 229). As the result of the large-scale develop-ments that have occurred in other countries during&apos; the war, the ammonia oxidation process must now be regarded as another established method of producing nitric acid, and also nitrates (pars. 368-71).It has been pointed out that: (a) Reliance upon the arc process as hitherto operated for the whole of an emergency demand for nitric nitrogen would be out of the question on account of the magnitude of the power requirements alone (par. 391). For example, to meet an annual demand for 100,000 metric tons of fixed nitrogen, power plant having a capacity of 841,000 kw. years would be needed (Table 49).Even if substantial blocks of power were available, the arc process would have to be ruled out as a war method of obtaining any effective supply of nitric nitrogen on account of the time and labour required for the construction and erection in an emergency of the extensive chemical installations (pars. 172-4).(6) The ammonia oxidation process requires very little power (pars. 230-1), can be installed in comparatively small units, and can be rapidly developed in an emergency on a scale sufficient to provide the enormous demand for nitric acid indicated by the precedent set during the war (pars. 368-71).(c) With a large by-product ammonia industry as a stand-by, it has been demonstrated that adequate supplies of ammonia for oxidation purposes can be ensured to meet any contingency by extensions of plant for synthetic ammonia processes, assuming sufficient nucleus installations and experience are available (pars. 375-8 and 386). By-product ammonia industries themselves are not well adapted for sudden expansion on a large scale (par. 535).(d) If a large export trade in ammonia fertilisers is maintained in peace time, the plant thus kept in operation represents a valuable reserve for meeting home requirements in an emergency (par. 481).(e) It is possible, under the stress of war conditions, for agriculture to be main-tained and even extended by resorting, in the absence of supplies of other fertilisers, to the use of ammonium sulphate alone (par. 452).(/) The ammonia oxidation process is more economical than the retort process as a method of obtaining nitric acid in peace time (par. 233 and Table 35), and its relative advantage wrould be more pronounced under war conditions (par. 395). Similar considerations apply to the manufacture of ammonium nitrate via the ammonia oxidation process and by non-synthetic methods respectively (Table 35, col. 8).633. A country possessing abundant supplies of ammonia is in a strong position for meeting peace-time requirements, and in an equally strong position for facing an emergency
on account of the facility with which nitric acid and ammonium nitrate can be obtained from ammonia by modern methods of catalytic oxidation.634. The by-product ammonia industries of the United Kingdom, although not well adapted for rapid expansion, are clearly an asset of the greatest value from the point of view of national insurance. There is no question, however, as to the essential need for supple-menting such industries by the installation both of the ammonia oxidation process and of synthetic ammonia processes on scales sufficient to provide real nuclei for expansion and the necessary experience.POWER FOR NITROGEN FIXATION IN THE UNITED &quot;KINGDOM.635. The cost of power is a vital factor in the general economy of the arc process for fixing atmospheric nitrogen, and an important consideration in the case of the calcium cyanamide process. As the result of an enquiry into the questions as to where and how large supplies of cheap power can best be obtained in the United Kingdom for nitrogen fixation purposes and the probable minimum cost, it has been concluded that: (a) The cheapest supply of power on a scale sufficient for the economical operation of the above-mentioned processes is that foreshadowed by a water-power development investigated by the Committee. The power is estimated at over 28,000 continuous kilowatts, and the running cost, under post-war conditions, at  3&apos;93 per full kw. year, inclusive of capital charges, (pars. 182 and 185).When regard is had to the future cost of coal and labour, it is improbable that electrical energy at this low cost will be furnished even by the best coal-fired power station practice (par. 185).The above water-power scheme was one of a limited number submitted to the Committee for examination, and the possible existence in the United Kingdom of other large powers capable of furnishing electrical energy at a post as low as, or even lower than, that indicated above must therefore be recognised (pars. 184-5).(6) The only possible chance of obtaining electrical energy from coal at a cost in any way comparable with that of water power is by operating upon a very large scale (par. 110) with large modern units of power plant (par. 113) and at a high annual load factor (par. 112). Moreover, the only proved method available at the present time is direct coal-firing (par. 185).(c) The estimated cost of generation by direct coal-firing at a power station having a maximum load of 100,000 kw. and an annual load factor of 100 per cent, amounts, upon a pre-war basis with coal at 7s. 6cZ. per ton, to  3&apos;8 per full kw.-year. For an annual load factor of 97&apos; 5 per cent., the corresponding estimate is  3&apos; 75 per kw.-year of 8,540 hours (Table 26).With coal at 10s. per ton, the figures would become  4 &quot;58 and  4&apos;51 respectively, and the effect of given percentage increases in the cost of plant, materials and labour under post-ioar conditions can be readily determined by reference to the itemized statements in a previous section of the Report (Tables 25 and 26).636. With the primary object of obtaining fixed nitrogen; the generation of power from coal by methods involving the total loss of the combined nitrogen in the coal itself is irrational (par. 114). In view of the vital need for utilising the national resources in fuel to the maximum advantage, the generation of power from coal should be effected by methods, if commercially feasible, whereby the nitrogenous and other by-products are recovered and not wasted, as hitherto, in the process of combustion (par. 114). Many complex factors are involved in this aspect of power production, and the Committee has investigated the question principally from the point of view of the generation of electrical energy on a large scale at a high annual load factor for nitrogen fixation and other electro-chemical purposes. Although the position would be modified in the case of large stations supplying ordinary industrial consumers at an average annual load factor of, say, 50 per cent. (pars. 165-6 and Appendix IV., Section VI.), the following broad conclusions have been arrived at: (a) As compared with direct coal-firing, all by-product power schemes involve a larger consumption of coal, a larger capital outlay and higher operating costs -for a given output of power in kw.-years (pars. 155, 158, and 161). When account is taken of the value of the by-products recovered from the coal, it does not necessarily follow that direct coal-firing is the cheapest method of obtaining power (par, 133).(6) In the present state of knowledge/ the application of by-product recovery processes to power production on a large scale offers no immediate prospect of reducing the cost of electrical energy from coal below the figures attainable by direct coal-firing and the use of large steam turbo-electric units (par. 185). Moreover, the employment of any of the well-established methods of treating coal for by-product recovery, namely, high temperature carbonisation (gasworks practice or coke-oven practice) or the complete gasification of coal in existing types of recovery producers, offers little or no prospect of competing upon a commercial basis with direct coal-firing (pars. 162 and 185).I 2
(c) Notwithstanding the divergent character of the results claimed to he obtainable by the carbonisation of coal at a low temperature and as yet unsubstantiated in commercial working, it is in this process that the main hope of obtaining cheaper power from coal appears to reside, apart, of course, from further economies in the cost of generation that might result from improvements in the thermal efficiency of steam power plant (pars. 102 and 185).(d) Provided that the full scale commercial operation of low temperature carbonisation over an adequate period establishes the validity both of the estimated costs and also of yields approximating to the highest that are claimed to be obtainable, a substantial reduction in the cost of, electrical energy is foreshadowed by the application of low temperature carbonisation alone to power production, or by the use of a combination process consisting of low temperature carbonisation as a first stage, followed by the complete gasification of the resulting coke under ammonia recovery conditions as a second stage (pars. 162 and 185). The two-stage process would probably give a larger total yield of by-products than any other method of treating coal (par. 156).(e) If the yields ultimately established do not exceed the loiocst that are claimed to be obtainable, the low temperature process,either alone or followed by the gasification of the resulting coke, would appear to offer little prospects of competing financially with direct coal-firing for the production of power on a large scale (par. 185).(/) In view of the national importance of developing cheap power for general industrial purposes, and having regard to the large amount of experimental work already carried out upon low temperature carbonisation, the Committee is strongly of the opinion that its feasibility and promise should be put to the test without delay by a thorough trial of any commercial plant that is installed in this country, and that such a trial should be organised and carried out with the national interests alone in view (par. 185).(g) High prices for coal (par. 159) and high rates of wages (par. 161) are a handicap to all by-product power schemes, owing to the thermal losses in such processes and the consequent increase in the quantities of coal required to be treated to obtaingiven output of power (par. 155). Moreover, a sustained market price for by-products is an essential factor in any margin in the cost of generation as between by-product power stations and coal-fired stations (pars. 164 and 188).(h) The financial stability of by-product power schemes, confronted with fluctuations both in the cost of coal and also in the market price of some or all of the by-products, would be much less certain over a period of years than that of direct firing (pars. 11)4 and 188).(g) It is probable that large by-product power schemes would have to receive the support of the Government or be carried out entirely as national projects (par. 189). This course would be justifiable so long as the advantages of direct coal-firing were not sacrificed to any substantial extent for the purpose of conserving products that could be obtained more economically byother methods (par. 189).637. With regard to other aspects of power production, it has been pointed out: (a) In the present state, of the art, the employment of gas-engines for the production of power upon a scale sufficient for the economical operation of nitrogen fixation processes under British conditions cannot be regarded as practicable (pars. 176 and 185).(6) There is no prospect of utilising the extensive deposits of peat in the United Kingdom for the production of power in bulk with by-product recovery (pars. 179, 185). If the problem of economically drying peat in large quantities continuously throughout the year were solved, the prospect would be distinctly favourable for gas-engine power installations of a moderate size, up to, say, 5,000 kw. (pars. 179 and 185).NITROGEN FIXATION UNDER BRITISH CONDITIONS.638. After a full consideration of the salient features of the various nitrogen fixation processes and of the ammonia oxidation process in the light of British conditions and of the resources and requirements of the country, the Committee has arrived at the following broad conclusions: (a) The arc process, although the most direct method of obtaining synthetic nitric acid, is handicapped by large power requirements, by low electro-chemical efficiency, and by the extensive and costly character of the necessary chemical plant (pars. 196-200). Nevertheless, the process would stand to advantage as compared with the retort (Chile nitrate) process as long as the cost of electricat energy was below  9 per kw.-year (pars. 127 and 201).(6) The calcium cyanamide process is a thoroughly well-established commercial proposition and is in operation on a large scale in many countries.   With electrical
energy costing not more than  5 per kw,-year, the process yields a cheaper marketable form of combined nitrogen than any other established fixation process, and is the only such process giving a solid nitrogenous fertiliser as a primary product (pars. 206,440;. The process is very adaptable, involving the manufacture of calcium carbide as an intermediate product and providing a ready, although indirect, method of obtaining-a comparatively cheap synthetic ammonia (pars. 213-4). Calcium cyanamide also consti-tutes a raw material for the manufacture of crude cyanides, and of organic products of growing importance, such as nitrate of urea (par. 213).There is no reason why the manufacture of calcium cyanamide (and calcium carbide), if laid out on a large scale, should not be successful in this country, because the higher cost of electrical energy, although an important factor from the point of view of foreign competition, is to a large extent off-set by other favourable factors, such as a cheap and abundant raw materials and the elimination of overseas freights (par. 217).A steam power station of 30,000 kw. maximum load is the minimum size that would be justifiable for the economical operation of the calcium cyanamide process under British conditions (par. 128).(c) The Haber process, which requires little electrical power and uses coke as the principal raw material, seems specially suitable for this country. It has hitherto been operated on a full commercial scale in Germany alone. With pure hydrogen at a cost not exceeding 2s. 6ri. per 1,000 cu. ft., the process is capable of producing pure ammonia at a cost which is below that of any existing ammonia process and is on a parity with that of the cheapest form of combined nitrogen obtainable by any nitrogen fixation process, namely, calcium cyanamide (pars. 225-6, and Table 35, cols. 1 and 3). The process is the most promising of all the synthetic methods of manufacturing ammonia and ammonium sulphate, and is likely to have a great future (pars. 240, 434).The experimental work carried out in full detail at the Munitions Inventions Research Laboratory under the direction of the Committee warrants the erection of a manufacturing unit.Further experience will doubtless lead to the overcoming of certain difficulties attending the operation of the process, and also to the production of pure hydrogen at a lower cost than hitherto (par. 240). In the opinion of the Committee, a figure of 2s. 6ci per 1,000 cu. ft. will ultimately be realised (par. 225). With the engineering and chemical experience available in this country, there is no reason why the process should not be quickly established as a commercial success on a substantial manu-facturing scale.(cl) The facility with which oxygen and the rare gases of the atmosphere can be obtained &apos;as by-products in the manufacture of calcium cyanamide and synthetic ammonia is an asset in favour of these processes for British conditions, because several important industries would derive a substantial advantage from the marketing of additional supplies of these gases at reasonable prices (pars. 252-65, and 267).The maximum use should undoubtedly be made of the by-products from all liquid air nitrogen plants installed for nitrogen fixation purposes in the United Kingdom. In the opinion of the Committee the imposition of restrictive trade agreements preventing the recovery and utilisation of by-product oxygen from nitrogen &quot;plants should not be permitted (par. 253).(e) The ammonia oxidation process, although still in its infancy from a commercial point of view, provides a ready method of obtaining nitric and nitrate nitrogen (pars. 229-30), as is evident from the very rapid extension of the process in other countries during the war. The capital and working costs of the latest types of plant are moderate (pars. 230 and 233), and Avith cheap ammonia, the process can furnish nitric acid at a much lower cost than the standard retort process (par. 238). It also shows to advantage even when utilising by-product ammonia charged at its pre-war market price (par. 233).Questions such as the best and most economical types of plant and methods of working can hardly be regarded as settled (par. 229) and the process is undoubtedly capable of simplification, particularly as regards the recovery of the oxides of nitrogen (pars. 299 and 337). Improvements in this direction might enable the process to produce synthetic nitrates at a competitive price (par. 267), and thus materially enhance its utility. There is little doubt that the process could be made a commercial success in this country.Ammonia oxidation converters of simple design are particularly well adapted for supplying the oxides of nitrogen required in the manufacture of sulphuric acid by the leaden chamber process (pars. 236 and 332). The converters are much more readily controlled than the usual nitre pots, which, in general, are wasteful of combined nitrogen. In the opinion of the Committee, such converters should be used throughout the sulphuric acid industry in substitution for nitre pots, thus rendering that industry independent of supplies of Chile nitrate.U   (1619 I 3
639. With regard to the partly developed nitrogen fixation processes, it has been pointed out that: (a) The Hausser (or explosion) process, when considered as a method of obtaining nitric acid and power simultaneously, presents considerable attractions (par. 278), and distinct possibilities attach to the employment of a simple design of free-piston explosion motor in conjunction with a compressed-air engine or turbine (par. 278).Although the process is handicapped by its dependence upon a large absorption plant for recovering the dilute oxides of nitrogen by existing methods, its development upon the lines indicated may result in a very cheap source of nitric acid (par. 279). The process is well adapted for British conditions, and, in the opinion of the Committee, it should be thoroughly investigated by means of a trial plant of sufficient size to furnish conclusive data.(6) The cyanide processes for the manufacture of synthetic ammonia or finished cyanides have been operated on substantial scales in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, but hitherto without commercial success (pars. 23. 281). The processes are handicapped by the properties and characteristics of the raw materials and crude furnace products, but the Committee has been informed on good authority that the consequent difficulties have already been overcome in the course of recent investigations carried out in this country (pars. 284, 302). Another problem to be solved is the heating of the furnace charge, and the evidence available points to the conclusion that the nearest approach to commercial success was achieved by resorting to internal electrical heating (par. 285).If the processes could be rendered continuous, they might have a successful future as a method of manufacturing synthetic ammonia; if not, they might attain success for making cyanides, although proving uneconomical as ammonia processes (pars. 282, 286). The processes are well adapted for British conditions, and, in the opinion of the Committee, offer sufficient hope of success to warrant a further trial (par. 303). In this connection, recent experience in electro-chemical operations and the assistance of engineering skill such as has been devoted to other fixation processes, should prove &apos; of great value (par. 285).640. Reviewing the nitrogen fixation problem as a whole, it appears that: (a) From the military standpoint, the special significance formerly attaching to nitric and nitrate nitrogen has been completely discounted now that it has been demon-demonstrated that an enormous war demand for these forms of combined nitrogen can be successfully met from ammonia nitrogen.(6) The development of the ammonia oxidation process has diminished the former value of the arc process as a method of obtaining nitric nitrogen, and has provided industrial countries lacking in cheap and abundant supplies of water power, with a reliable asset for safeguarding the future.(c) With reference to future developments in nitrogen fixation, it is probable that the prospects will be more favourable for ammonia-producing processes than for direct nitric acid processes on account of the relatively small demand for nitric nitrogen under normal conditions and of the facility with which it can be obtained from ammonia nitrogen by oxidation (par. 304).METHODS OF INCREASING THE HOME SUPPLIES OF BY-PRODUCT*  AMMONIA.641. Apart from the ultimate success or otherwise of methods for carbonising coal at a low temperature or of the application of by-product recovery processes to power production upon a large scale, the investigations of the Committee point to the definite conclusion that the output of ammonia nitrogen from existing industries in the United Kingdom could be increased.642. In the case of the metallurgical coke industry it has been shown that: (a) Although there has been a rapid increase in the use of recovery coke-ovens, there are still a large number of beehive coke-ovens in operation in this country, as much as one quarter of the total quantity of coal carbonised at coking works in 1917 being treated under non-recovery conditions (par. 499).(6) The eventual abandonment of non-recovery practice would lead to a very substantial increase in the output of ammonia nitrogen (par. 501) and would also tend to conserve the supplies of coking coal owing to the larger yield of coke per ton of coal carbonised in recovery ovens (Appendix III., p. 158).It has also been stated that: &quot;There is no longer ground for supposing that, from one and the same coal, beehive is naturally superior to by-product coke as a blast furnace fuel&quot; (Final Report of Coal Conservation Committee, Cd. 9084, 1918, page 80).The Committee is of the opinion that every encouragement should be given to bring about a much more rapid replacement of existing beehive ovens by recovery ovens than is at present occurring.
643. Dealing next with the gas industry, and more particularly will) the larger works, it has been pointed out that: (a) There are considerable variations in the results obtained even among the principal gasworks contributing the bulk of the recorded output of ammonia nitrogen from the gas industry (par. 494).(b) It is considered On high authority that the general average for all the larger works could be raised by improvements in existing practice (par. 494).In the above connections it is significant to note that there are repeated references in the Annual Reports of the Chief Inspector of Alkali Works to the losses of ammonia at gasworks.. These losses by volatilisation and by the atmospheric oxidation of &quot; volatile &quot; ammonia into &quot; fixed &quot; ammonia are attributed to unsuitable handling and storage, for example, to leaky and uncovered storage tanks, often in exposed positions and fed by unsubmerged pipes, to inefficient washers, and to poorly constructed sulphate of ammonia stills carelessly worked by liming intermittently. Attention is also drawn in these Reports to simple expedients for avoiding losses, such as the employment of a thin layer of oil for protecting the ammonia liquor in storage tanks, which have been shown to be efficient in practice. (Report : 1911, p. 18 ; 1912, pp. 117-18; 1913, p. 15, 115 ; 1914, pp. 16-17 ^ 1915, pp. 42 and 47.)   .There is obviously considerable scope for attention to detail, and in view of the importance of conserving and augmenting the home production of ammonia, the Committee is unanimously of the opinion that energetic measures should be taken for ensuring an improvement in the practice at all works where the average yields are smaller than those shown to be obtainable when various precautions are adopted for minimising losses.644. With regard to the smaller gasworks, the following points may be noted : (a) Ammonia liquor is run to waste at a large number of small gasworks (par. 495) and Appendix III., page 153), but the problem of conserving it is mainly an economic one.(b) It has been suggested that a travelling sulphate plant should be used for conserving this ammonia, and also that a simple design of concentrating plant, using the waste heat in the gases from the retort flues, should be installed at small works, and the concentrated liquor conveyed in motor tank wagons to a centrally situated works for conversion into sulphate (Appendix III., p; 154).(c) The following quotation from the Annual Report of the Chief Inspector of Alkali Works indicates another possibility : It is . . . considered that gasworks producing as small a figure as five million cubic feet of gas per annum can profitably enter into the manufacture of sulphate of ammonia. (Report for 1912, p. 97.)With improved, facilities for the transport of sulphuric acid and concentrated ammonia, there is little doubt that a useful addition to the home supplies of fixed nitrogen could be secured from many of the smaller works, although the margin of profit to such works might be small. As long, however, as the recovery could be effected without financial loss to the works, the national interests would best be served by conserving the by-product nitrogen to the fullest possible extent.The Committee is of opinion that the problem should be taken in hand at once, and that every effort should be made to devise an organised system of recovery, collection, and distribution capable of economical application to as many of the smaller works as possible.645. Generally, in regard to the gas industry as a whole, it has also been observed that:  -Gasworks would be enabled to carbonise more coal per annum than hitherto, and thus increase the home production of ammonia, if there were assured outlets for the extra coal gas and coke produced (Appendix III., pages 154-5).In the opinion of the Committee, every encouragement should therefore be given to the efforts that are being made to promote the wider use of coal gas and coke for domestic and industrial purposes.646. Finally, the question of economy in the industrial use of coal is of increasing importance:  . .It has been shown that the by-product ammonia industries as a whole accounted for the consumption of 40 million tons of coal in 1917 (Table 56).It is unquestionably a matter of concern to the nation that industries making such a large annual demand upon the reserves of coal should utilise the coal to the maximum advantage, for the production not only of by-products, such as ammonia, benzol, and tar, but also of primary products like illuminating gas, metallurgical coke, and producer gas.In the opinion of the Committee, the time has arrived when coal economy and conservation in commercial working should be secured by setting up definite standards, based upon the qualities of coalin use, and upon practice that has been uniformly
realised under good working conditions. Industries which are large consumers of coal should be required to conform to such standards. As an initial step, standards of ammonia recovery should be formulated and made applicable to all the larger works treating coal under by-product recovery conditions.THE NITROGEN PROBLEM IN OTHER PARTS OF THE EMPIRE.647. With reference to the nitrogen requirements and potential resources of other parts of the Empire, it appears from the evidence supplied to and from other data compiled by the Committee that :-(a) The local demand in different parts of the Empire for nitrogenous fertilisers, and in fact for all forms of combined nitrogen, is still comparatively small (par. 007).(6) The growing calls upon agriculture will bring about important modifications in the course of a few years, and a large demand would soon arise if cheap supplies of fixed nitrogen were available (par. 607)., The investigations of the Committee into the cost of manufacture of: synthetic nitrogen products prove that cheap supplies are practicable in several parts of the Empire (par. 607).(cj The latent resources in coal and other raw materials and also in water power would, without question, enable sufficient supplies of all forms of combined nitrogen to be obtained within the Empire to meet the requirements of war and peace (par. 603).(d) Canada possesses exceptional water-power resources accessible to the seaboard and capable of easy development at a cost which would probably permit of the manufacture of synthetic nitrogen products more cheaply than at any other world site. The manufacture of such products could also be profitably undertaken in many other parts of the Empire where cheap water power is being or could be developed, for example in Egypt, India, New Zealand and Tasmania (par. 604).(e) There are large deposits of low-grade coal in the Empire, for example, in Australia, India and South Africa. These deposits can be cheaply mined and might possibly be utilised for ammonia recovery, as is already the case in Natal, thus conserving the higher grades of coal for Other purposes (par. 606).648. Imperial preparedness for defence will be one of the vital problems to be faced on the conclusion of peace (par. 610).   Upon this question it has been pointed out that: (a) Notwithstanding maritime supremacy, the military situation has been funda-nientally changed now that it is commercially practicable to manufacture essential nitrogen products synthetically (par. 608).(6) The risk attaching to dependence upon Chile nitrate cannot be afforded (par. 609).(c) It would probably be wise to concentrate the major portion of the nucleus defensive installations in the United Kingdom (par. 610).(d) Supplementary installations in other parts of the Empire would be essential, because no portion should be dependent entirelv upon external supplies in case of war (par. 610).    ....(e) Imperial defence is too vital a matter to be subordinated to other considerations (par. 611), but a wise policy in regard to defence could to a very large extent be made a sound economic policy (par. 612).(/) The risk of sea transit is a factor to be taken into consideration in formulating a policy (par. 613).649. It would be necessary for an Imperial Authority to make a careful study of all aspects of the problem before a definite policy could be framed (par. 614), and the Committee wishes to urge the importance of a co-ordinated policy.STATISTICS.650. The Committee desires to draw attention to the fact that the statistics quoted in this Report are, for the most part, reproduced as given in the original sources and are not without inconsistencies, to which due.weight has been given in framing conclusions.651. Reference is made in an Appendix (Appendix III.) to the great difficulties experienced in obtaining full and reliable statistics for the nitrogen industries and associated industries of the United Kingdom, and to the fact that many of the figures given in this Report and its Appendices have not previously been published. The Committee has only been enabled to obtain them through the assistance afforded by Government Departments, and in some cases by direct application to the whole of the firms and undertakings engaged in a particular industry. The Committee again wishes to acknowledge its indebtedness to all those who have so willingly co-operated in this matter.652. There is no question that the existence, at the outbreak of war, of really comprehensive statistics for the nitrogen industries and associated matters would have been of the utmost
-value to the Government. The lack of such information has undoubtedly been responsible for a very great expenditure of time and effort.653. The Committee is unanimously of the opinion that, in the national interests, there is an unanswerable case for the collection and the publication of annual statistics of a much more comprehensive character th&amp;n those at present available. The data collected by various Departments and Committees during the war should form a valuable basis for devising a system of the kind needed.XIV.-RECOMMENDATIONS.654. In making the recommendations set out below, the Committee has been guided by the following salient facts: (a) The sources of supply of combined nitrogen in the United Kingdom must be increased considerably if the existing and prospective home demands are to be met and the pre-war scale of exportation is to be maintained.(b) The existing sources of supply of combined nitrogen in the United Kingdom proved wholly inadequate for meeting the war demands.(c) The risks and costs of importation during war are very serious. *(d) Combined nitrogen (as cyanamide or ammonium sulphate) can be obtained by synthetic processes at a cost, at the factory, which is less than half the market price of combined nitrogen from other sources, pre-war conditions being taken as the basis in each case.(e) Concentrated, nitric acid can be made by synthetic processes for about half the pre-war cost by the standard retort process via Chile nitrate.(f) The ammonia oxidation process provides a means whereby, during a state of war, the importation of Chile nitrate would be rendered unnecessary.(g) The world.&apos;s demand for combined nitrogen appears to double every ten years. The increased production during the war has not been more than the normal rate of increase during peace.(h) The actual consumption of combined nitrogen for agriculture in the United Kingdom has practically doubled during the war, and there is certain to be a further increase.(i) No very large increase in the output of by-product ammonia in Great Britain in the immediate future seems probable.655. The specific recommendations of the Committee are set out under various headings, and it will be observed that they embody the main recommendations put forward in the Interim Report (Appendix 1.). After mature consideration, the Committee sees no reason for modifying its Interim Recommendations and desires to reaffirm them.PROVISION FOR NATIONAL SAFETY.656. The following measures are recommended by the Committee as a minimum provision for safeguarding the future and for meeting a portion of the growing home demand for various nitrogen products.Calcium Cyanamide Process.The Committee recommends that (i)&apos; This process shoiild be established in Great Britain without delay, either by private enterprise (supported, if necessary, by the Government) or as a public work.(ii) The scale of manufacture shoiild be sufficient to give an output of about 60,000 tons of cyanamide per annum, equivalent on the basis of combined nitrogen to about one-eighth of the present home production of ammonium sulphate.(Hi) The necessary electrical energy should be obtained either from water power in Scotland or from a large steam-power station.The Committee has ascertained from the Water Power Resources Committee of the Board of Trade that there are several sites in Scotland where the necessary water power can be developed at a reasonable cost. If steam power is used, a suitable site for the cyanamide factory might be obtained at one of the capital power stations proposed by the Board of Trade Committee on Electric Power Supply (Cd. 9062, 1918), and the costs given hereunder are based upon that assumption.On the basis of pre-war prices plus 50 per cent., the approximate capital outlay at a water-pOwer site would be  1,680,000, inclusive of the capital cost of the hydro-electric development, the latter being taken at  40 per e.h.p. ( 53&apos; 6 per kw.) of maximum
demand. If the factory were erected at the site of a large steam-power station, the approxi-mate outlay would he  800,000, inclusive of the proportionate cost of the power plant. The-chemical sections for either site Avould cost about  445,000 of the above totals.Upon the same basis (i.e., pre-war prices plus 50 per cent.), the approximate cost, at the-factory, of raw cyanamide (19* 5 per cent. N.) would be     v table 72. ESTIMATED POST-WAR FACTORY COSTS OP RAW CYANAMIDE.Sound; op Power.,	Price of elect-trical Energy. Per kw.-year.

Moreover, as the result of the action taken upon the Committees Interim Recommendations (Appendix I.), considerable progress was made with the plans and specifications for a suitable steam-power station designed as the nucleus of a possible capital power station. These plans and specifications are available.The Committee suggests that it might prove desirable, in the first instance, to arrange for a certain proportion of the calcium carbide produced as an intermediate product to be utilised as such instead of converting it into cyahamide.At the date of the Interim Report (Appendix I,), the Committee was informed by the Board of Agriculture that the establishment of the calcium cyanamide industry in this country would meet with their approval. As the outcome of a recent communication, the Committee is authorised to state that the Board&apos; are still of opinion that the establishment of this process Avould be beneficial.Synthetic Ammonia (Haber) Process.This process has hitherto only been operated on a full commercial scale in Germany., Nevertheless, as a result of the continuous experiments carried out since the Summer of 1916 at the Research Laboratory of the Munitions Inventions Department, the Government decided early in 1918 to erect a large factory at Billingham-on-Tees for the manufacture of synthetic ammonia and ammonium nitrate. This factory, projected as an emergency war measure, did not reach an advanced stage through causes which it is unnecessary to specify, and in view of the altered situation the need for the completion of the factory as an ammonium nitrate project no longer exists.The Committee nevertheless recommends that The synthetic ammonia process should be established forthwith on a commercial unit scale and extended as rapidly as possible, as a post-war measure, up to a minimum manufacturing scale of 10,000 tons of ammonia (equivalent to 40,000 tons of ammonium sulphate) per annum. The Billingham factory should be utilised for the purpose if such a course is practicable. . ,The evidence on the question of capital cost is somewhat uncertain, but the outlay for a factory of the capacity indicated, on the basis of pre-war prices plus 50 per cent., would probably amount to  600,000 if ammonia were the end-product, or to  780,000 if the factory were laid out for the manufacture of synthetic ammonium sulphate.&apos; Ammonia Oxidation Process.This process, in its modern developments, has been proved to afford a reliable and simple means of obtaining nitric acid and nitrates. Early in the war, a full-scale installation was erected on the Thames by private enterprise,, supported by the Government, the older method of oxidation being utilised. A long series of experiments carried out at the Research Laboratory of the Department resulted in the design of a simple and modified plant which has been installed on a trial scale at several works in the country. The designs of the ammonia oxidation section of the Government ammonium nitrate factory referred to above were based, upon the results obtained in these research and trial operations.
recommendations.135The Committee recommends that-(i) An ammonia oxidation -plant should be completed in conjunction with the synthetic ammonia factory already referred to, as was originally contemplated by the Government, on a scale sufficient to produce about 10,000 tons of strong nitric acid (95 per cent.) per annum, or its equivalent in nitrates.(ii) The plant should be designed to utilise either synthetic or by-product ammonia as a raw material, because the national interests demand that adequate experience in the production of nitric acid from ammonia from all sources should be available in this country.Upon the basis of pre-war prices plus 50 per cent., the estimated capital outlay for an installation having a capacity of 10,000 tons of strong nitric acid (calculated as 100 per cent.) per annum would be  120,000.The process, when thoroughly tested, will probably lead to the ultimate abandonment of the older retort method of producing nitric acid from Chile nitrate, and also to the abandonment of nitre pots in chamber sulphuric acid manufacture.BY-PRODUCT AMMONIA INDUSTRIES.657. The Committee makes the following recommendations for conserving and increasing the output of combined nitrogen from existing by-product ammonia industries, for securing the better utilisation of the national resources in coal, and for reducing the consumption of raw coal as a fuel.The Committee recommends that (i) Encouragement should be given to facilitate and to ensure the replacement of non-recovery coke-ovens by recovery ovens at a much more rapid rate than hitherto, in, order that the reserves of ccking coal shall be utilised to the maximum advantage.(ii) It should be incumbent on all gasworks which now contribute to the home supplies of ammonia nitrogen to put into practice the various simple expedients that have beon proved to result in a considerable diminution in the loss of ammonia by volatilisation or otherwise. The statutory powers administered by the Local Govern-ment Board through the Chief Inspector of Alkali Works, should, if necessary, be extended to ensure that this is done.(Hi) In collaboration with the responsible organisation of the gas industry, a comprehensive scheme of ammonia recovery and collection (including distribution of sulphuric acid) should be devised, which will be economically applicable to as many as possible of the smaller works Avliere ammonia is at present allowed to run to waste. Wherever it can be shown that no financial loss would be incurred by any works included in the scheme, the works should be required, in the national interests, to co-operate. When a scheme has ,,been devised, powers should, if necessary, be conferred upon the Local Government Board to ensure its operation and administration.(iv) In collaboration with the responsible organisations of the by-product ammonia industries, definite standards of efficiency in ammonia recovery should be formulated (based upon the qualities of coal in use and upon good average practice realised under the conditions in force at by-product recovery installations of various classes and sizes), and all works contributing towards the home supplies of ammonia should be required to conform to appropriate standards of recovery. When such standards have been formulated, powers should, if necessary, be conferred upon the Local Government Board to ensure their observance.(v) Encouragement should be given to all efforts to extend the use of coal gas and coke in the place of raw coal for domestic purposes, for steam-raising, and for other industrial requirements.TRIAL OPERATIONS AND RESEARCH.4658. With regard to the trial, in the United Kingdom of various nitrogen fixation and recovery processes, and to the general question of research upon the nitrogen problem, the Committee makes the following recommendations :-Hausser (or Explosion) Process.The Committee recommends that Plans and estimates should be prepared for a plant of the smallest size sufficient for the thorough testing of the modified process (par. 278) by which nitric acid and power can be obtained simultaneously. In the event of the estimates proving favourable, a company possessing a coke-oven installation of the necessary capacity, or other suitable supply of gas, should be encouraged to erect the plant and carry out the trials.
Cyanide Processes.The barium process, using externally-heated retorts, is at present under trial in this country.The Committee recommends that Steps should be taken to test, by.means of a trial plant on a small works scale, other modifications of the processes, and especially internal electrical heating. The problem of devising a continuous process for the production of ammonia should be thoroughly investigated at the same plant.Low Temperature Carbonisation of Coal.This subject is under investigation by the Fuel Research Board.The Committee recommends that Any commercial plant erected or about to be erected in this country should be thoroughly tested. In the national interests, the trials should be organised and carried out by the Government.Sulphate Recovery Processes.The Committee recommends that The possibilities of sulphate recovery processes which avoid the use of sulphuric acid (par. 626) should be thoroughly investigated on a commercial scale, and encouragement and assistance should be given to companies and undertakings willing to carry out the trials for the benefit of the by-product ammonia industries as a whole.Research.The Committee recommends that (i) The researches on the nitrogen problem initiated during the war should be-continued after the war under the auspices of the Government for the general benefit of the country.(ii) The results of the researches carried out up to the present date should be edited and published at the earliest possible moment as a further Appendix to this Report, subject to such reservations as may be considered necessary by the Government.(Hi) Members of the Research Staff of the Munitions Inventions Department should be allowed to communicate to Scientific Societies the details of the work they have been engaged upon, subject to such reservations as may be considered necessary by the-Government.IMPERIAL SUPPLIES.659. The Committee recommends that A co-ordinated policy should be framed for safeguarding the future nitrogen - requirements of the Empire, and this should be done by an Imperial Authority.As the information already, available concerning the future prospects and possibilities in the different portions of the Empire will require to be supplemented before such a policy can be framed, the Committee suggests that Advisory Bodies should be set up to examine the local aspects of the nitrogen problem and to furnish the Imperial Authority with the requisite data.OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS.660. In connection with other aspects of the Committee&apos;s enquiry, the following additional matters arise : Oxygen and other By-products from Nitrogen Plants.The Committee recommends that (i) All liquid air nitrogen plants used in connexion with nitrogen fixation installa-tions in the United Kingdom should be operated to the maximum advantage for supplying the growing home demand for oxygen and argon.(ii) The imposition of restrictive trade agreements such as have been operative at nitrogen fixation installations abroad which prevent the recovery and utilisation of by-product oxygen from nitrogen plants should not be permitted in this country.Statistics.The Committee recommends that-Comprehensive annual statistics for the nitrogen industries of the United Kingdom and for the home consumption of coal by various classes of users and industries should
CONCLUDING REMARKS, 137be officially collected and a detailed summary of the figures should he published. Strong representations on this subject should be made to the Government Departments concerned.The Committee suggests that the cpiestion of statistics is also worthy of the attention ofthe Overseas Governments.special OBSERVATION.661. As far as the United Kingdom is concerned, nitrogen fixation and allied processes will constitute a new &quot; key &quot; industry. The Committee is of the opinion that the initiation . and development of the industry will require the active support of the Government.CONCLUDING REMARKS.662. The Committee regrets to report that Prof. F. G. Donnan and the late Mr. A. J. Walter, K.C., were prevented by serious indisposition from assisting in the concluding stages of the work. It is gratifying, boAvever, to be able to place on record their general concurrence with the findings of the Committee lip to the date when their active participation in the inquiry ceased, and also the fact that they signed the reports of the Sub-Committees of which they were members.663. The Committee desires to place on record its highest appreciation of the services rendered by its Secretary, Mr. R. T. G. French, O.B.E. His wide technical knoAvledge, unremitting labour and devotion to duty have been of the utmost value throughout the inquiry, not only in.the work of recording the deliberations of the Committee and its Sub-Committees during the period June 1916 to February 1919, but also in collating the very large amount of evidence and information that required to be critically examined, and in the preparation of this Report and the Sub-Committee&apos;s Reports.664. The Committee also desires to refer to the&apos; valuable assistance rendered by the following officers of the Munitions Inventions Department, namely, Mr. H. W. Dickinson, the Secretary of the Munitions Inventions Panel; Mr. Win. Hill, junr., who has worked in close ^co-operation with the Secretary of the Committee and has applied his editorial experience Avith conspicuous success; and Mr. H. A. Humphrey, Avhose wide engineering experience has proved of considerable advantage to the Committee in the later stages of the inquiry.We have the honour to be,Your Lordship&apos;s obedient servants,(Signed)     H.

APPENDIX I.ABSTRACT OF THE INTERIM REPORT THE ACTION TAKEN.4
ABSTRACT OF  THE INTERIM REPORT: THE ACTION TAKEN.It became apparent to the Committee in the early stages of its investigations that, in the event of the demand for munitions requiring an increased produc-tion of nitrogen compounds in the United Kingdom, there were definite schemes which could be &apos; recom -mended for the purpose. Steps were accordingly taken to ascertain, through the Chairman, the views of the Minister as to the policy to be pursued by the Committee in dealing with the war aspects of the inquiry.In a Minute dated December 28th, 1916, the Minister stated that he would be glad to have practical proposals put forward as soon as possible, and that while every advantage should be taken of temporary expedients, efforts should be made to promote pro-cesses which were likely to be of permanent value to the country.On account of the incompleteness of the inquiry, the Committee Avas necessarily obliged to defer pre-senting a detailed review of the nitrogen problem. Certain conclusions and definite recommendations having the unanimous support of the Committee were, however, embodied in an Interim Report dated February 22nd, 1.917, and forwarded to the Minister.It is unnecessary to quote the Interim Report at length, but it is important from the point of view of the Oommittee&apos;s final conclusions and recommenda-tions that the main outlines of the proposals put forward at that date and of the action subsequently taken should be recorded here.The introductory statement to the Minister con-tained the following passage : Wc have confined this Report to practical schemes for augmenting the production in this country of materials urgently needed for munitions ; you will be fully conversant with requirements in this direction. In considering the schemes, however, we have kept in mind their value in connection with agriculture, and in putting forward this Report we were also influenced by the probable need of fertilisers on a large scale, due to the new policy of the Board of Agriculture.The Report then proceeded to deal with the possibility of conserving and augmenting the output of ammonia from existing plant at gasworks and coke-ovens, and pointed out that (a) The output from gasworks had actually declined during the war period although additional carbonising plant had been completed at such works.(/;) The advantages normally attaching to the practice of mixing coal-gas with carburetted water-gas (obtained by gasifying coke with steam and enriching the water-gas with gas oil) had little weight in time of war in comparison with the necessity for increasing the output of ammonia, benzol, and toluol, and for reducing the consumption and hence, the importation of gas oil.(c) There was danger, unless immediate steps were taken, of a further decline in the output of ammonia from gasworks owing to the decreasing efficiency of tho existing plants consequent upon the inferior class of labour then available for their working and maintenance.(iv) There were cases in which ammonia and tar oils were going to waste due to the shortage of sulphuric acid necessary for fixing tho ammonia and to lack of transport for the conveyance of ammonia liquor and tar oils to places where they could be utilised.(e) A further increase in the output of ammonia from by-product coke-ovens could probably be obtained if steps were taken to prevent losses.The following recommendations and observations were put forward in respect of the by-product ammonia industry: In view of the importance of this matter, we recommend that a Central Executive Authority,&apos; under the Ministry, and consisting of men familiar with the industries concerned, be formed without delay to take the following action : (I) To prevent existing waste of ammonia and&apos; other by-products consequent . upon in-efficient working of plant, shortage of sulphuric acid, or lack of transport facilities,(2) To encourage the more extensive use of coke for industrial as well as domestic purposes-in place of raw cDal, thus absorbing extra coke produced at gasworks, and allowing such raw coal as is suitable to be diverted to gas companies for carbonisation and by-product recovery. (3) To limit during war time the use of water-gas plant as auxiliary to town-gas plant; to&apos; increase the amount of coal carbonised in existing plants and thus increase the out-put of by-products,  the gas companies utilising the surplus coal-gas (after the by-products have been removed) for their works&apos; requirements and thus setting free solid fuel; and to ensure that the gas companies are provided with any addi-tional supply of coal rendered necessary by tho preceding proposals. (4) To undertake, through competent inspectors, an examination on the spot of any difli-culties retarding the by-product output of gasworks and coke-oven plaut, and to assist in the removal of difficulties both by technical advice and also by a judicious use of the executive powers conferred upon the Central Authority. We arc of the opinion that, by the means speci-fied, an immediate increase in the output of ammonia and other by-products can be secured from existing-plant, thus adding materially to the resources of tb is -country during the current year.It may also be possible through this Central Authority to develop the use of by-product recovery plant in connection with coking plant, and also to-develop the larger use of properly constructed coke-oven plant with by-product recovery* )A short review was then given of the newer methods of obtaining nitrogen products which had not hitherto been established on a working basis in this country. In respect of the ammonia oxidation process, and of the Haber or synthetic ammonia process, the following comments were made: (a) As time is an essential factor, we consider that tho oxidation of home-produced by-product ammonia is the quickest and best of the new methods for obtaining nitric acid and ammonium nitrate under war conditions.(v) Practically no information as to the details of a commercial Haber plant is known outside Germany, but we have been carrying out cxperi-mental investigations upon the process. These experiments show very great promise for the future, but we are not in a position to put forward definite recommendations in this Report as to the establish-ment of the Haber process upon an industrial scale in this country at the present moment. We consider, however, that it is of great importance to proceed with the erection of a semi-industrial unit forthwith.The Committee then made the recommendations set out below: So far as the conditions of labour permit, wc strongly recommend that the ammonia oxidation process and the cyanamide process should be established forthwith in this country, and that the-schemes outlined under the headings A and B below should either be undertaken directly by the Govern-ment, or carried through with the assistance of private enterprise (if available) supported by the-Government.We also recommend, without any reservations as to the conditions of labour, that a semi-industrial unit for the synthesis of ammonia should be erected at an early date.Heading a dealt with ammonia oxidation plant (or plants) capable of producing in the aggregate at least 10,000 tons of nitric acid per annum from gasworks or coke-oven ammonia. An estimate was given of the capital outlay and operating costs under war conditions,.
and the time required for the erection of the plant was placed at six to nine months.Heading B dealt with plant for the manufacture of calcium cyanamide on a scale of approximately 66,000 tons per annum. An estimate was given of the capital cost of the chemical factory and of the necessary steam turbo-electric power station of 30,000 kw. capacity, and of the approximate production costs, all on the basis of war conditions. It was pointed out that the plant could be erected in from 12 to 18 months if priority were given for the constructional work.Reference was made to the adaptability of the calcium cyanamide process in the following terms: Under war conditions the cyanamide could be used partly as a fertiliser and partly in place of sea-borne cyanamide which is already being used for the production of ammonia at works in this country. If necessary, the whole of the cyanamide could be used for the production of ammonia. The latter could be combined with nitric acid from existing processes to form ammonium nitrate, or it could be oxidised to nitric acid by means of plant of the type mentioned above, or it could be used partly for one and partly for the other purpose.and figures were given to indicate the cost of extend-ing the cyanamide factory in order to utilise the product in the ways referred to.The attention of the Minister was then directed in the following sentences to the possible use of spare power: If there is an urgent need for fertilisers, it is possible that the spare power at some of the,laiger existing electric power stations might, as a war measure, be utilised for the manufacture of cyanamide-mide, and an output of several thousand tons of cyanamide per annum could be obtained; only chemical plant would need to be installed.It must be emphasised that in view of the relatively small amount and high price of the power available at existing stations, and of the enhanced costo of running the chemical plants due to the fact that they would be considerably smaller than the most economical size, such schemes can only be con-sidered as xoar emergency measures. If desired, the approximate figures for one or more eyanamide plants of the above character could be furnished.The Report concluded with a brief consideration of the economic prospects after the war of the processes and plants that have been recommended, and in respect of the calcium cyanamide factory it was observed that: A plant of the kind recommended would appear, therefore, to be a sound commercial proposition, and if not completed before the war ends, the construc-tional work would provide useful employment during the period of demobilisation. It would also be of national value in that an additional fertiliser would be placed at the disposal of the agricultural industry, and thus exercise a steadying effect upon the prices both of Chile nitrate and of ammonium sulphate.We learn that the establishment of a cyanamide industry in this country would meet with the cordial approval of the Board of Agriculture.The Minister invited a delegation from the Oom-mittee to meet him on March 15th, 1917, in order to discuss matters arising out of the Interim Report. As the outcome of this meeting, the Minister came to certain decisions upon the recommendations that had been put forward, and appointed an Executive Com-mittee to supervise the necessary action and to report to him as required.The Minister&apos;8 decisions were as follows :  ,(a) Byproduct Ammonia. The Committee was requested to deal with the problem of conserving ammonia and of augmenting the output on the lines of the recommendations.(J) Ammonia Oxidation Plant.-The Ministry of Munitions would undertake the installation of one Government plant on the lines recommended, or, if the Committee so advised, the Ministry would agree to the erection of not more than three plants by suitable private firms.The information resulting from the research work was to be placed freely at the disposal of bona fide. manufacturers, but was not to become the property of any one firm or group of firms.(c) Calcium Cyanamide Factory. The Committee was requested to investigate the relative merits of a Government scheme, and of schemes involving privateU  G619enterprise that had been put forward, and to submit a report embodying a definite proposal.(//) Synthetic Ammonia l&apos;lant.-The erection of a full-sized trial unit was authorised.The Minister appointed: Sir Arthur Duckham, K.C.B., Sir Keith Price, and Sir Henry E. P. Goold&apos;-Adams, K.B.E., C.B., C.M.G., to act as an Executive Committee, and at a later date invited Mr. G. S. Albright, and Sir John Snell, M.Inst.C.E,, M.I.E.E., to serve upon it.This Committee first dealt with the question of by-product ammonia, and made an inquiry into the conditions then prevailing. It was decided to enlist the co-operatioii of various Government Departments and Committees, of the gas companies, and of industrial and domestic users of coke, and after this had been done the solution of the remaining problems was left under the direction of the Explosives Department in view of the organisation already in existence in that Department for dealing with the supply and utilisation of ammonia.Conferences were then held with a number of manu-facturers who were likely to be closely interested in the ammonia oxidation process, and several firms at once agreed to take up the further study of the process with a view to its commercial development. In August 1917, the research work of the Nitrogen Products Committee had reached a stage at which the installa-tion and trial of a full-scale unit was the only remaining step necessary for providing the data for the erection of a factory. Arrangements were therefore made for a trial unit, giving an output of about 300 tons of strong nitric acid per annum, to be erected in London,&quot; special facilities for this purpose having been given by a Member of the Committee. At this juncture, the work of estab-lishing the process on a commercial scale for the manufacture of nitric acid and ammonium nitrate was handed over to the Explosives Department as the result of a request made by that Department to the Executive Committee.In the meantime, the latter Committee had closely examined the question of the manufacture of calcium cyanamide, and came to the conclusion that the schemes involving private enterprise did not adequately fulfil the ends in view. The Committee reported to the the Minister to this effect in July 1917, recommending the erection of a Government factory and the appoint-ment of an engineer to prepare the plans and specifica-fcions for the necessary electric power station. The appointment having been sanctioned, the Committee proceeded with the preparation of a complete scheme for the Minister&apos;s final approval. After an investi-gation by a technical delegation sent abroad for the purpose, the Committee was in the position of being able to recommend the adoption of a particular process.The work upon the Haber process had made con-siderable progress, and in October 1917, a semi-technical unit was being brought into operation. It was antici-pated that the results obtained with this large experi-mental plant would definitely settle the remaining problems as to the chemical engineering details of the full-sized trial unit authorised by the Minister in March 1917.In October 1917, the Explosives Department sub-mitted a memorandum to the Minister recommending the erection of a National Factory for the manufacture of synthetic nitrogen compounds by means of the Haber and ammonia oxidation processes. This memo-randum was referred by the Minister to a Committee of the Munitions Council, which considered it in relation to the cyanamide scheme then in course of preparation, That Committee reported that the time required for the erection of a large electrical power plant under the conditions prevailing was the limiting factor in determining the date at which the cyanamide ^ scheme could be brought into operation. It therefore recommended, in December 1917, that use should be made of existing spare power, and that a smaller cyanamide factory, together with a synthetic ammonia factory, should be proceeded with.A further memorandum was submitted to the Minister by the Explosives Department in February 1918, recommending that the cyanamide process should not he proceeded with, and that the Haber process alone should be utilised as the basis of the National Factory
A copy of this memorandum was remitted to the Nitrogen Products Committee, and as the recom-mendation reversed the one put forward in the Interim Report, a meeting was held on February 15th, 1918, at the instance of the Controller of Munitions Inventions, in order that the Committee might have an opportunity of submitting to the Minister its considered opinion upon the proposed National Factory scheme.The Committee was asked to consider the question as to the probability of obtaining a satisfactory pro-duction of ammonia by the Haber process during the war period, and passed the following resolution, which was transmitted to the Minister through the Con-troller: The Committee is of the opinion that the large-scale Haber process should be proceeded with without delay, notwithstanding the fact that some uncertainty exists as to the time in which a commercial yield can be obtained; but the Committee is strongly of the opinion that the cyanamide process should be pro-ceeded with simultaneously to the extent to which it is practicable.The resolution and the memorandum from the Explosives Department were submitted to the Com-mittee of the Munitions Council, which reported to the Minister as follows on February 21st ; It was agreed that the fixation of any considerable quantity of nitrogen by the cyanamide process would involve the use of so much electrical power that the necessary plant could not. be installed in less than about 18 months to two years. It was stated that a factory based on the Haber process, granted good facilities, should be producing within a year. TLe consumption of electrical energy for this process is small, and the necessary power is already available. The Committee concur, therefore, that the Depart-ment of Explosives Supply should be instructed to proceed with the erection of the factory for the fixation of nitrogen by the Haber process.An announcement that the Ministry was embarking upon the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen on a very considerable scale by means of the Haber or synthetic ammonia process, was made public by the Minister, the Right Hon. Winston S. Churchill, in the House of Commons on April 25th, 1918, in his speech on the Vote for Supply for the Ministry of Munitions.

It is understood that the returns in his reports of &quot;sulphate of ammonia produced in this country&quot; are calculated on an average figure of 24-5 percent, ammonia. The ammonium sulphate exported has also been taken as 24- 5 per cent, ammonia.* In addition to the production of ammonia in this country, small quantities of various ammonium salts were imported from Germany before the war. During 1913, the total quanti-ties amounted to 558 tons ;a;120 metric tons of nitrogen. There was also a nett average import during the years 1911-13 of 132 tons of anhydrous ammonia equivalent to 109 metric tons of nitrogen.(2) From Board of Trade Returns.(3) The figure for the export of ammonia liquor is bused on data supplied by Messrs. Brothevton &amp; Co., Ltd.(4) and (5) From BoaTd of Trade Returns.(6) This figure represents the ammonia used in the prepara-tion of cyanides exported (see Note 30).(7) The estimate of the consumption of ammonium sulphate used for agricultural purposes was furnished by the Board of Agriculture.(8) The amounts of ammonia (expressed as 25 per cent, ammonium sulphate),&apos;sodium nitrate, and potassium nitrate used in the manufacture of explosives for mines and quarries were calculated from reports issued by the Chief Inspector of Mines for 1912, 1913 and 1915. These reports contain the quantities of the various explosives used, which amounted to a total of about 30 million lb. Of this total, 28 million lb. were accounted for by 20 representative explosives. The composition of these was ascertained from marshals Explosives and other authorities, and from the data so obtained the quantities of ammonia, sodium nitrate and potassium nitrate used in their preparation were calculated. The 38 explosives representing the remaining 2 million lb. were assumed to have the same average composition as the20 explosives whose composition was actually ascertained, and the quantities of ammonia, sodium nitrate, and potassium nitrate required for their production were calculated on this basis,  f Average for 1912-13 only.(9) The figures for the estimated ammonia loss (expressed as 25 per cent, ammonium sulphate) in the ammonia-soda process were supplied by Messrs. Brunner, Mond &amp; Co., Ltd.(10) The amount of pure anhydrous ammonia (expressed as 25 per cent, ammonium sulphate) used in the cold-pro-ducing industries during 1911, 1912,&apos; and 1913 is based on figures supplied by the Gas Light and Coke Company.Amaionium Nitrate ;(J 1) The average import figure is taken from the imports of Norwegian synthetic products (Norwegian Trade Returns)Sodium Nitrate :(12) and (13) From Board of Trade Returns.(14) The amount of sodium nitrate used in the manufac-ture of explosives exported has been calculated from the Board of Trade Returns for 1911, 1912, and 1913, in the manner explained in Note 8.   **See under Note, (17).(15) The Board of Agriculture estimated the pre-war consumption of sodium nitrate for agriculture at 80,000 tons. In view of the quantity now known to have been used for other purposes, this would appear to have been an over-estimate and the figure has therefore been put at 75,000 tons.(16) The estimate of sodium nitrate consumed in the manufacture of sulphuric acid in this country is based on statements in Sulphuric Acid and Alkali (Lunge) and in Dictionary of Applied Chemistry (Thorpe), as to the amount of sulphuric acid manufactured annually in this country and the quantity of sodium nitrate consumed per ton of acid produced.(17) The amount of sodium nitrate used in the inanu-facture of nitric acid was calculated from statistics of the actual production of the acid supplied by Messrs. The Clayton Aniline Co., Ltd., the United Alkali Co., Ltd., and F. W. Berk &amp; Co., Ltd.** These figures i.e., (14), (17), (19), (20), represent, as far as can be ascertained, the total amount of sodium filtrate used previous to the war as a source of the nitric acid employed in the industries, and are equivalent to 14,152 ions nitric acid (100 per cent.).(18) The quantities of potassium nitrate manufactured in this country by the conversion process from sodium nitrate were supplied by Messrs. Curtis&apos;s and Harvey, Ltd.(19) See Note 8,  **See under Note (17).

T. Brock &amp; Co., Ltd.( 8) With regard to the 2,474 tons of potassium nitrate shown as remaining unaccounted for, considerable quantities are employed in the manufacture of rockets and flares ex-ported, and in the meat-curing and glass-making industries, for which no statistics can be obtained.Sodium and Potassium Cyanides.(29) The figures for the pre-war imports of sodium and potassium cyanides^are from the German returns.(30) From Board of Trade Returns. No separate statistics of sodium, as distinguished from potassium cyanide are obtainable. In calculating the nitrogen, therefore, the average content of 28 per cent, was taken for the cyanides exported, and 25 per cent, nitrogen for the cyanides imported, it being understood that the exported cyanides were chiefly sodium and the imported chiefly potassium.Sodium Nitrite.(31) The pre-war imports of sodium nitrite are taken from the Norwegian Trade Returns.Calcium Cyanamide.(32) The pre-war figures for the imports of calcium cyanamide-mide are based on the Norwegian Trade Returns.Calcium Nitrate.(33) The pre-war figures for the imports of calcium nitrate are based on the Norwegian Trade Returns. The nitrogen content of the calcium nitrate has been taken as 13 per cent.(34) The Board of Agriculture estimate that for the pre-war period 10,000 tons of cyanamide and calcium nitrate together were used in agriculture, but only 6,719 tons are accounted for as coming into this country. It is known, however, that cyanamide was imported both from Germany and from the United states, but no figures are obtainable.PRE-WAR MARKET PRICES OF NITROGEN PRODUCTS.  Average 1911-13.Product.

THE PRODUCTION OF AMMONIA NITROGEN INTHE UNITED KINGDOM,GENERAL  STATISTICS.Prior to the years 1909-10, the United Kingdom was the world&apos;s largest producer of by-product am-monia. Since that date Germany has taken the lead, mainly on account of the extensive development of recovery coke-oven plant in that country. Until quite recently, the second position was maintained by the United Kingdom practically without challenge, but as the result of the rapid increase in the installation of recovery coke-ovens in the United States during the war period, there is a clear indication that, at an early date, the United Kingdom may have to be classed as the third largest producer.Under pre-war conditions, the United Kingdom was a relatively small consumer of ammonia nitrogen, and from 70 to 75 per cent, of the total production was exported, mainly in the form of ammonium sulphate, the export trade in this product considerably exceeding that of any other country. Although exports were substantially maintained during the early part of the war, they have since practically ceased owing to the increasing home demand for ammonia nitrogen for munitions and agriculture.The growth in the world&apos;s demand for ammonia nitrogen, principally for fertilising purposes, is strikingly illustrated by the expansion of the by-product industry in the period 1903-13, theworld&apos;s production increas-ing from about 540,000 tons of ammonium sulphate in 1903 to about 1,390,000 tons in 1913, an expansion of over 150 per cent. Notwithstanding the fact that the production of Chile nitrate in the same period also increased from about 1,430,000 tons to about 2,465,000 tons, an expansion of about 70 per cent., the world&apos;s demand for nitrogenous fertilisers appears to have exceeded the supply, judging from the fact that the market price of fixed nitrogen, while showing fluctua -tions, had a general upward trend.The war has necessitated the diversion to the munitions industry of a very large proportion of the supplies of fixed nitrogen that would otherwise have been used in agriculture. As a result of this and of other exacting demands, the position in regard to the world&apos;s supplies of food has become of the gravestconcern, and countries have been compelled to make great efforts to maintain and augment their home pro-duction of food. The success attending the efforts of the United Kingdom in this direction would not have j been possible in the absence of large supplies of nitrogenous fertilisers, and the credit for these is due to the home by-product industry, which has also been called upon to meet a large demand for ammonia nitrogen for munitions. The present home consump-tion of ammonium sulphate in agriculture is moi^e than double the pre-war consumption of all artificial nitrogenous fertilisers, and still further quantities are demanded.The existing position will be modified when other nitrogenous fertilisers become available after the war, but it is certain that the home consumption of ammonia nitrogen will remain much larger than it was before the war. The extent of the home requirements, how-ever, will depend upon factors such as the maintenance or even the extension of the present policy of food production, and the desirability of or necessity for rendering the country partly or wholly independent of imported nitrogen products. There are also clear indications that the world&apos;s demand is still on the increase, and there will thus be openings in former and new markets when international trade is resumed.The future of the home by-product industry is a matter of the greatest importance to the United Kingdom, and in view of the undoubted possibilities residing in the post-war period, it is essential to esti-mate the potential capacity of the industry to meet an additional demand. * This can best be done by an examination of the general trend of the industry during the pre-war and war periods, and of the possibilities attaching to the successful development of modifica-tions in existing practice.Dealing in the first place with the industry as a whole, the general position during the pre-war and war periods is indicated in the following table, which sum-marises, in tenns of ammonium sulphate, the official figures for the total output of all forms of ammonia nitrogen,TOTAL PRODUCTION OF AMMONIA NITROGEN IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, 1911-17.Expressed as Long Tons of Ammonium Sulphate (24- 5 per Cent.

The nett effect of these modifications is represented by an increase of 14 per cent, in the total production in the year 1917 as compared with the average annual production before the war.The different branches of the by-product industry are considered in detail later under their appropriate headings, but it is of utility to indicate at the present stage the percentage contribution of each branch to the total home production.

Over 70 per cent, of the home production of ammoma nitrogen was thus obtained from gasworks and coke-ovens, the remainder being derived from other industries utilising coal, shale and bone. By far the largest proportion of the whole output was derived from coal, and the position as regards the three sources of fixed nitrogen is indicated in further detail in the two following tables : DERIVATION OP AMMONIA NITROGEN-	Total Output expressed as Long Tons of Ammonium Sulphate (24-5 per cent.

Statistics compiled from The Gas World Directory (1917).		About 70 per cent, of the total annual output of gas is made by the works which produce 500 million cu. ft. and over, i.e., by 71 works or only 4-6 per cent, of the total number in operation. These works also yield the largest proportion of the ammonia nitrogen recovered annually in the gas industry.The most striking point revealed by the above table is the existence of a very large number of small works; for example, it appears that over 50 per cent, of the gasworks in the United Kingdom have an annual output of less than 20 million cu. ft. of gas, over 38 per cent, less than 10 million cu. ft., and over 22 per cent, less than 5 million cu. ft. It is probably safe to assume that in the majority of these works the make of coal gas is of the order of 10,000 cu. ft. or less per ton of coal carbonised. On this basis there are as many as 598 works carbonising less than 1,000 tons of coal per annum. The general economy of all the works consuming up to a few thousand tons of coal per annum compares unfavourably with that of the larger works, and the bearing of this point upon the production and conservation of ammonia liquor at the smaller works is referred to later.Pre-war Statistics.The position of the gas industry before the war as regards the quantity of coal carbonised and the outputof ammonia nitrogen is summarised in the following table. It should be noted that the figures for coal are based upon returns from authorised undertakings and also from other small works including private gasworks.-STATISTICS FOR THE GAS INDUSTRY, 1912-13.Yeah.

If the relation between the coal carbonised and the output of colce in 1912 and 1913 is taken as an approxi-mate guide, the figures for the output of colic in 1911 (Annual Report of the Chief Inspector of Mines) indicate that about 16&apos;6 million tons of coal were carbonised at gasworks in that year. The corresponding output of ammonia nitrogen was equivalent to 168,783 tons of ammonium sulphate, representing an average yield of about 22&apos; 7 lb. of sulphate per ton of coal. .A proportion of the coal used in the gas industry was carbonised at small works which made no contri-bution to . the home supply of fixed nitrogen, the ammonia removed from the gas at such works being ultimately wasted through causes which are referredto later. In the aggregate, these works cousumed a considerable tonnage of coal, so that the average yields indicated above are on the low side when considered in relation to the works which actually contributed the recorded output.It is considered on high authority that, as a close approximation, practically the whole of the available supply of ammonia nitrogen was derived from the numerous lai-ge and small works comprising the autho-rised undertakings in the United Kingdom. If the industry is considered upon this basis, the pre-war statistics indicate the position shown in the table given below: STATISTICS FOR THE OAS INDUSTRY, 1911-13.Based upon data for Authorised Undertakings only.

From the preceding figures, it appears that the quantity of coal carbonised at the numerous small works not included in the list of authorised under-takings amounted to approximately 960,000 tons in 1911, to 880,000 tons in 1912, and to 780,00.0 tons in 1913. The distribution of the coal between the two classes of works was therefore as follows: COAL CARBONISED AT DIFFERENT GROUPS OF GASWORKS.	Distribution of Coal between Authorised	Year.

When account is taken of the number of small works also included in the authorised undertakings, it is to be concluded that a minimum of at least 6 per cent, of the coal carbonised annually at gasworks before the war contributed little or nothing to the available home production of ammonia nitrogen. Even if the &quot;ammonia removed from the gas at all the smaller works had been conserved and Utilised, an increase in the output of fixed nitrogen to the above extent could not have been expected, because the practice and general character of the plant of such works was necessarily of a lower standard than that at the larger works.Summary of Pre-war Statistics.Summarising the pre-war statistics, it appears that the average annual consumption of coal at all gasworks amounted to about 17-1 million tons, the authorised undertakings accounting for 1612 million tons. The average output of ammonia nitrogen taken over the whole industry was equivalent to about 22-7 lb. of ammonium sulphate per ton of total coal carbonised. On the assumption that the output was derived almost entirely from authorised undertakings, the average yield amounted to 24 lb. of sulphate per ton of coal carbonised at such works.  Taking the average figures
for the three-year period, the make of gas (coal gas and water gas) at such works averaged 13,268 cu. ft. per ton of coal utilised, the corresponding figure for coal gas alone being 11,613 cu. ft., and representing from 87 to 88 per cent, of the total make of gas.The position in regard to the larger and smaller gasworks will now be examined in further detail.Coal Carbonised at Principal Works.The quantity of coal carbonised at the thirty-three principal gas undertakings in the United Kingdom in the year 1913 was as shown in the table in the opposite column.As much as 50 per cent, of the coal consumed in the gas industry in 1913 was thus carbonised at 33 principal works, i.e. at about 2 per cent, of the total number of works in operation, where the conditions for the recovery, conservation and utilisation of ammonia were more favourable than at most of the smaller works.Variations in the Yield of Ammonia at Large Works.Nevertheless, there were considerable variations in the yield of ammonia nitrogen among large gas-works as is shown by the table below, which embodies figures relating to some of the principal gas undertakings in the United Kingdom for the period 1911-13.It is not possible to attribute such variations merely to differences in the nitrogen content of the coals employed, and there is no doubt that the average yield could be increased in many cases by improving the arrangements for storage and by working up the liquor at more frequent intervals instead of allowing it to accumulate and thus lose ammonia by volatilisation. The opinion has been expressed by a recognised authority that the home production of ammonia nitrogen from gasworks could be augmented to a greater extent, and also more economically, by improve-ments in the practice at the larger works in general, than by conserving the ammonia liquor hitherto wasted at the smaller works.Losses of Ammonia Liquor at Small Works.Having regard to the efforts that have been made during the war period to conserve and augment the home production of ammonia nitrogen, it can be takenGOAL CARBONISED AT PRINCIPAL GASWORKS, 1913.Unduktakings,	Coal Carbonised.

According to returns supplied by the last group of works, the total annual loss of ammonia liquor is approximately 3-5 million gallons of 10-oz. strength (2-17 per cent. NH;)), equivalent, after allowance has been made for losses in working-up, to about 1,300 tons of ammonium sulphate (24-5 per cent. NH3), or only 0&apos; 7 per cent, of the total output of ammonia nitrogen from gasworks in 1917. Under pre-war conditions, when the importance of conserving ammonia was not so apparent as at present, the wastage was undoubtedly greater, and upon the basis of the figures previously given for the percentage of coal carbonised at works other than authorised undertakings, it is probable that the average output (1911-13) might have been augmented by some 2 or 3 per cent, had it been possible to conserve the ammonia at all the small works.The works in question are nearly all too small to warrant the installation of ammonium sulphate plant, and the principal causes of the wastage of the ammonia liquor are said to be (a) the insufficiency of the storage capacity at the works, (/;) the lack of plant for working-up the liquor to a saleable strength, and (c) the ineon-venient situation of the works, which renders it unre-remunerative to convey the liquor to a railway and then, by rail to a chemical works where it could be utilised.In order to conserve the ammonia liquor obtained at small works it is proposed under present conditions to resort to the employment of a travelling sulphate plant. It has also been suggested that in normal times the works should instal a simple and inexpensive plant for concentrating the liquor by means of the waste heat in the gases from the retort flues, the liquor being subsequently collected in motor tank wagons and taken to a centrally situated works to be converted into ammonium sulphate.It is clear that the problem of dealing with the I small works is an economic one. The evidence avail-able points to the conclusion that the home resources lin fixed nitrogen would not be substantially influenced even if the problem were satisfactorily solved.I Water-gas Plant and Gasworks.I Carburetted water gas, produced by gasifying coke I with the aid of steam and then enriching the resulting 1 gas with gas-oil, is used to a considerable extent for &apos; mixing with coal gas, and accounted for 12 per cent, of i the total output of the authorised undertakings in the ) United Kingdom during the pre-war period. The ! practice of using water gas was adopted primarily for ; the purpose of coping with sudden or excessive demands, j but has since become more general as an auxiliary to ; the manufacture of coal gas. For present purposes it j is unnecessary to enter into the j reasons for this I development, but a notable effect has been to provide ! an outlet for considerable quantities of coke that might I otherwise have been difficult to dispose of under normal conditions.Assuming it were feasible to dispenseVith the use 1 of water gas, the production of an equivalent quantity of coal gas would involve, on the basis of pre-war figures, the carbonisation of 14 per cent, more coal in gasworks and perhaps a somewhat greater quantity under present conditions. In these circumstances, the output of ammonia nitrogen from the gas industry might be increased to a corresponding extent, repre-senting an addition of about 6 per cent, to tho pre-war annual (average 1911-13) output from all sources or about 5-3 per cent, to the total prodriction in 1917. If the water-gas plant were used merely for the purpose of coping with sudden or excessive demands not capable of being easily met by the carbonising plant, the effect upon the output of nitrogen would bo smaller.The possibilities in the above direction in relation to the war demand for ammonia nitrogen were dealt with in the Interim Report of the Committee (Appendix I.). With regard to the prospects under normal conditions, it is to be observed that the dis-placement of water-gas plants would have the effect of liberating the large quantities of coke now consumed by, them and of increasing the total output of coke by some 14 per cent, owing to the extra coal that would have to be carbonised. In the case of some of the larger gasworks, however, the capacity of the retort plant itself is insufficient to permit of the use of water-gas plant as a standby only. There is every reason to anticipate that water-gas plant will be used to an increasing extent in the future if the present practice of supplying a gas of standard calorific value, instead of a standard illuminating power, is continued and extended, so that no increase in the home output of fixed nitrogen can be expected in the directions just discussed.Operating Gasworks at an increased Load Factor.Considerable attention has been given to the possibility of securing an addition to the home resources in fixed nitrogen by maintaining in con-tinuous operation a larger proportion than hitherto of the total retort plant at existing gasworks. Progress in this direction, however, would depend essentially upon the demand for the increased output of coal gas and coke, and the question demands a brief consideration on account of the new conditions created by the war.An indication of the extent to which the retort plant is utilised throughout the year under normal conditions in a large gasworks where carburetted water gas is not employed is given by the following figures from an authoritative source.NORMAL USE OF RETORT PLANT IN GASWORKS.Month.	Percentage of Maximum Capacity in Operation.January	87February  -	83March	80April -!	75May	62June -	57July -	55August     -	52September -	60         1October	68November -	76Decembor -     -     -	89Monthly average -	70It is considered on good authority that quite one half of the retort plant that is shut down during the spring, summer and autumn months could be worked to carbonise additional coal, the other half being repaired in readiness for the Winter demand. If the figures for the six months May to October are amended upon this basis, the monthly average for the year would be increased to 80 per cent. Assuming that from 70 to 75 per cent, of the total plant were maintained in operation during the six months in question, the monthly average for the whole year would be 79 to 81 per cent., and the quantity of coal that could be carbonised per anmim would be about 14 per cent, greater than under ordinary conditions.Taking account of the extent to which carburetted water gas is used throughout the country for mixing
with coal gas, it is estimated that upwards of 10 per cent, more coal could he carbonised per annum if gasworks were operated at a higher load factor of the order previously mentioned.As a matter of fact, the great demands made upon the gas industry during the war, both for gas and for by-products such as ammonia, benzol and toluol, have been largely met by operating existing works at a higher average annual load factor than formerly, and only to a comparatively small extent by the installation of additional plant.War Developments.The Committee has been informed by the Chief Inspector of Mines that the quantity of,coal carbonised at gasworks in 1917 amounted to 18,821,483 tons. As compared with, the position in 1913, the industry as a whole has therefore undergone an expansion of 6 per cent. This figure does not represent the full extent of the war demand upon the larger gasworks, as is indicated by the following table, which embodies coin-parative figures for 33 of the principal undertakings in the United Kingdom, the same work3 being dealt with in the columns for 1913 and 1917.WAR MODIFICATIONS IN THE GAS INDUSTRY.Pre-war and war positions of 33 of the principal gas undertakings, 11 in London and suburbs andof the United Kingdom.in other partsItems.

The 33 principal undertakings thus carbonised about 10 per cent, more coal in 1917 than in 1913, and accounted for nearly 52 per cent, of the total quantity of coal carbonised at all gasworks in 1917 as compared with 50 per cent, in 1913. When regard is had to the numerous other centres in which war industries have been established, it is probably safe to assume that the condition of affairs revealed by the above table also applied in the cases of the majority of the larger gasworks. A comparatively small amount of additional plant has been installed since the outbreak of war, and in the light of preceding observations concerning the normal operation of retort plant, it is clear that the capacity of many existing works must have been taxed almost to the limit notwith-standing the restrictions imposed upon the consumption of gas for lighting purposes.The available output of ammonia nitrogen in 1917 was equivalent to 188,478 tons of ammonium sulphate, an increase of only 3 - 4 per cent, on the figure for 1913. The average output per ton of coal carbonised was therefore 22 - 4 lb. of sulphate as compared with ah average of about 22 - 7 lb. for the gas industry in 1913, or with an average of 24 lb. on the assumption that the pre-war output was derived almost entirely from authorised undertakings. The extended production of concentrated ammonia liquor for munitions and the temporary restriction in the output of ammonium sulphate have tended to decrease the available output of ammonia nitrogen owing to the &quot;too frequent higher losses &quot; in the former process as compared with those incurred in the manufacture of sulphate (Annual Report of the Chief Inspector of Alkali Works for 1917). On the other hand, the statistics for the principal undertakings show that there was an actualdecline in the average yield of ammonia liquor per ton of coal carbonised at a number of the larger works. There are reasons for believing that the decline has been fairly general, and it is attributed in part to the fact that the quality of the coal supplied was inferior to that formerly available.Post-war Considerations.The question as to whether the gas industry can maintain or even extend its present scale of operation depends upon the post-war demand for coal gas and coke.In regard to the former, the present large con-sumption of gas in metallurgical and other industries might be maintained if the gas were procurable at a reasonable price, seeing that efforts will be made to continue many of the industries on their present scale after the war, and probably to develop them further. It is possible that the extra cost of manufacturing a larger quantity of gas during the summer months by running the retort plant at a higher load factor would be proportionately small owing to the better distribu-tion of the capital charges; it has also been suggested that the normal output might be charged with the total costs for distribution and maintenance, thus per* mitting the extra output to be sold without loss to; large consumers at a figure approximating to the cost of manufacture at the holder. The policy of allowing a rebate to large consumers has already been adopted by a number of gas undertakings.The increasingly difficult situation in respect of the mining and transport of coal has been responsible for a notable advance in the demand for coke during the war period, but it is doubtful whether domestic and
industrial users would voluntarily resort to its use on a scale sufficient to absorb the whole of the present output when raw coal is again procurable without restriction. Owing to the absence of an adequate home market before the war, large quantities of coke were exported, and it is possible that further outlets might be found in this direction. On the other hand, a step has recently been taken that may have an im-portant bearing upon the home demand in the near future, namely the partial substitution of coke-firittg for coal-firing at the Greenwich Generating Station of the London County Council. If the results anticipated at this station are substantiated by the operation of the plant over an adequate period, and lead to the adoption of coke-firing at other large power stations, a demand would be created for substantial and regular supplies of gasworks coke. The magnitude of this potential demand is indicated by the fact that if coke alone were used in a station having an installed capa-city of about 50,000 kw., a maximum load of about 40,000 kw., and an average load approximating to that of the Greenwich Station, the annual requirements would be of the order of 160,000 tons.Another factor to be taken into account is the possible effect of modifications in gasworks practice. For example, increased yields of ammonia have been obtained by the admission of steam to the carbonised charge in vertical retorts, this procedure also causing a notable increase in the output of gas per ton of coal. It is difficult, however, to estimate what influence the general adoption of this practice would have upon the output of ammonia nitrogen, because the increase in yield has to be considered in relation to the smallerquantity of coal that would be required for a given make of gas. with the cessation at the termination of the war of the present abnormal demand for concentrated ammonia liquor, and a return to the normal practice of con-converting the ammonia into sulphate, it is to be anticipated that the average yield per ton of coal carbonised throughout the industry will be raised at least to the pre-war level of 2217 lb. as soon as supplies of coal of the necessary quality become available, If the gas industry maintained its present scale, an increased output of some 2,400 tons of ammonium sulphate per annum might thus be expected. If the average yield at all gas-works, including the smaller ones, could be raised to a level of 24 lb, of sulphate per ton of coal carbonised, the output would be increased by about 13,000 tons per annum, equivalent to nearly 3 per cent, of the total home production from all sources in 1917. A further addition could also be obtained if improvements were effected in the practice at a number of the larger works, for example, in regard to the storage-age of ammonia liquor, and by the more frequent working-up of the liquor.In the light, however, of the considerations pre-sented above, it appears doubtful whether any other substantial contribution to the home production can be expected from the gas industry in the period imme-diately after the war. On the other hand, the possi-bility of a temporary decline in the output from gasworks following the conclusion of peace must be recognised on account of the need for the overhauling and repair of the plant that has been working continuously under abnormal conditions during the war.THE METALLURGICAL COKE INDUSTRY.The manufacture of metallurgical coke in this nitrogen and other products to be obtained from the coal,country is carried out both in ovens, like the beehive The number of coke-oven works in operation in theoven, which yield no other commercial products than United Kingdom prior to the war is indicated in thecoke, and in by-product ovens, which enable ammonia following table: COKE-OVEN WORKS IN UNITED KINGDOM, 1911-13,Yeab.

The above figures indicate that steady progress was being made before the war in regard to the adoption of by-product recovery ovens, and that the practice of &apos; using beehive ovens was on the decline.Pre-War Statistics.The position of the coke-oven industry in the pre-war period as regards the quantities of coal carbonised and ammonia nitrogen recovered is summarised in the table opposite.If the relation between the coal carbonised and the output of coke in 1912 and 1913 is taken as an approxi-mate guide, as in dealing with the gas industry, the figures for the output of coke in 1911 (Annual Report of the Chief Inspector of Mines) indicate that about 17&apos;9 million tons of coal were carbonised in coke-ovens in that year. The corresponding output pf ammonia nitrogen was equivalent to 105,343 tons of ammonium sulphate, representing an average yield of about 13 - 2 lb. of sulphate per ton of coal.A substantial proportion of the coal, for which no official figures appear to be available, was carbonised in non-recovery ovens, and therefore made no contribution to the output of ammonia nitrogen. The average yieldsquoted below provide an indication of the effect of the continuous decline in the number of beehive ovens in operation in the years 1911-13, but are decidedly on the statistics FOR THE COKING INDUSTRY, 1912-13.Teak.

low side when considered in relation to the recovery ovens which contributed the whole of the recorded output of ammonia nitrogen.It is usually considered that about one-third of the total coal was oarbonised in non-recovery ovens in the pre-war period. Upon this basis, the average yield per ton of coal carbonised under recovery conditions would have represented about 19-8 lb., 21 lb., and 22-8 lb. of sulphate respectively in the years in question.Summary of Fre-War Statistics.Summarising the pre-war statistics, it appears that the average annual consumption of coal at all coke-oven works amounted to about 18 -1 million tons, of which perhaps 12 million tons were carbonised under recovery conditions. The average output of ammonia nitrogen taken over the whole coking industry showed a gradual increase from 13 to IS lb. of sulphate per ton of total coal carbonised due to the progressive decline in the number of beehive ovens employed. On the assump-tion that two-thirds of the total coal was carbonised in recovery ovens, the average yield at these ovens showed a gradual increase from about 20 lb. to about 23 lb. of sulphate per ton of coal.Variations in the Yield of Ammonia.The figures quoted above may be contrasted with those shown in the table in the opposite column for the &apos; average yield of ammonium sulphate obtainable from different classes of coking coals by the best modern practice.AVERAGE YIELD OF SULPHATE FROM COKING COALS.

Moreover, fully 75 per cent, of the total number of beehive ovens in opera-tion throughout the country were located in the same districts. From the point &apos;of view of the output of fixed nitrogen, the advantage to be gained by the sub-stitution of recovery ovens for beehive ovens in Durham and Yorkshire is apparent.War Developments.There have been considerable modifications in the coking industry in this country during the war period, the number of beehive ovens in operation having fallen from over 13,000 in 1913 to about 6,900 in 1916, while the number of recovery oven installed has increased from about 7,800 in 1913 to about 8,700 at the present time. These changes have resulted in a substantial U  6619increase in the output of ammonia nitrogen from coking works as is indicated by the following figures.STATISTICS FOR THE COKING INDUSTRY, 1916-17.Year.

It will be seen that the average yield per ton of total coal advanced, from 15&apos; 19 lb. of sulphate in 1913 to 17&apos; 73 lb. in 1916, an increase of over 16 per cent, and to 18 &quot;19 lb. in 1917, an increase of nearly 20 per cent.As a consequence of the continuous increase in the use of recovery ovens and of the rapid decline since 1913 in the number of beehive ovens in operation, a larger proportion of the total coal is now carbonised under recovery conditions. It is considered that the proportion amounts to about 75 per cent, at the pre-sent time (Od. 9084, previously quoted) as compared with about two-thirds under pre-war conditions. Upon this basis, the average yields in 1916 and 1917. would have represented the equivalent of about 23- 6 lb, and 24-2 lb. of sulphate respectively per ton of coal carbonised under recovery conditions.Post-War Considerations.The chief prospects of obtaining a marked increase in the output of ammonia nitrogen from coke-oven works in the post-war period reside in the eventual adoption of recovery ovens to the exclusion of types which do not permit of by-product recovery, and in the further expansion of the iron and steel industries in this country.In the event of further progress leading to the eventual abandonment of non-recovery coking practice, it is not unreasonable to assume that the average yield of ammonium sulphate for the whole industry could, in time, be raised to 22 - 4 lb. and possibly to 25 lb. per ton of coal carbonised. The position as regards the output of ammonia nitrogen if the coking industry were maintained on its present scale would then be as follows: POSITION&quot; IP NON-RECOVERY OVENS WERE ULTIMATELY SUPERSEDED BYMODERN RECOVERY OVENS.Production of Ammonia Nitrogen if 20&apos;5 million tons of Coal wore Carbonised per annum in Modern Recovery Ovens alone.

Theextent of the increase is difficult to estimate, but upon the basis of the possible consumption of pig-iron after the war, it is considered by the expert referred to that the post-war demand for blast furnace coke may exceed the pre-war figure by as much as 50 per cent.When account is taken of the existing increase upon the pre-war demand, of possible improvements in blast furnace practice, and of the fact that the substi-tution of recovery ovens for beehive ovens would result in an increased yield of coke per ton of coal carbonised, it appears that the coke-oven industry may, in the future, be responsible for a very substantial increase in the home production of fixed nitrogen.THE PRODUCER-GAS INDUSTRY,A considerable quantity of coal is consumed annually in the manufacture of producer gas for general industrial purposes, but only a portion of this coal is gasified under conditions which permit of the recovery of ammonia.From the point of view of the conservation of ammonia, recovery producer practice shows to out-standing advantage as compared with any other com-mercial method of treating fuel because about 70 per cent, of the nitrogen in coal can be recovered regularly in the form of ammonia or ammonium sulphate when a suitable coal is gasified under proper conditions in recovery producers operating at a fairly steady load. The extensive scale upon which recovery producer practice is already resorted to in the United Kingdom is indicated by the fact that the approximate rated gasification capacity of the plants now installed is in axcess of 1,500,000 tons of coal per annum.Through the assistance afforded by the makers and users of recovery producer plant, the Committee has been able to obtain complete statistics for the pre-war period and for the year 1917, and these are summarised below.Pre-War and War Statistics.There were about 20 firms and undertakings employing recovery producer plant in 1911, and the number had increased to about 30 by the year 1917. In the case of more than 50 per cent, of the firms, the quantities of coal gasified exceeded 20,000 tons per annum, being considerably greater than this figure in several instances. The total quantities of coal gasified in each of the years 1911-13 and in 1917, the corre-sponding output of ammonia nitrogen and the average yield of ammonium sulphate per ton ton of coal gasified, are indicated in the following table:

The quantity of coal consumed annually is thus seen to be quite appreciable, having increased from about 714,000 tons in 1911 to about 941,000 tons in 1917. The figure for the latter year represents an increase of over 21 per cent, upon the average con-sumption during the three years prior to the war, and an increase of about 13-5 per cent, upon the con-sumption in 1913. It may be noted that the quantity of coal gasified in 1917 represented over 60 per cent, of the total rated gasification capacity of the recovery producers installed in the country.The average yield of ammonium sulphate per ton of coal gasified was maintained with considerable uniformity during the years 1911-13 at a mean value of 84-8 lb. of sulphate per ton. There was a notable decline in the average yield during the year 1917, the figure of 66-3 lb. representing a decrease of 21 - 7 per cent, upon the mean value obtained during the pre-war period. The falling-off in the output of ammonia nitrogen is mainly attributed to the inferior quality of the coal now available as compared with that em-ployed before the war.  In some cases, however,temporary breakdowns of the recovery plant and difficulties in obtaining supplies of sulphuric acid have been contributory factors.-Variations in the Yield oi Ammonia.The working results obtained at the various recovery producer plants show considerable variation as regards the average yield of ammonia nitrogen per ton of coal gasified. It is important to remember, however, that the results in any given case are very largely depen-dent upon the nitrogen content of the coal employed , the precise conditions of gasification in regard to the quantity of steam used and the superheat of the blast, and upon the uniformity or otherwise of the load upon the producer. Without precise data upon these points, it is obvious that the figures for different works are not directly comparable. Nevertheless, the following tn.ble provides an interesting indication of the average results obtained over a full year&apos;s working at recovery producer plants of large and small size utilised for various classes of industrial work: AVERAGE WORKING YIELDS OF AMMONIA NITROGEN.Year.

The detailed figures supplied to the Committee show that of all the plants in opera-tion throughout the period 1911-13 and also in 1917, in only one case was the average yield in the latter year in excess of that realised in any one of the three years prior to the war. With regard to the larger plants gasifying 20,000 tons of coal and upwards per annum, average yields of less than 80 lb. of sulphate per ton of coal were obtained in 2, 4 and 5 cases respectively in the years 1911, 1912 and 1913, but in 11 cases in 1917.The highest average yields obtained at plants gasifying less than 10,000 tons of coal per annum ranged from 70 to 78 lb. of sulphate per ton in the rjeriod 1911-13, the corresponding figure in 1917 being63&quot;5 lb. Tn the case of the smaller plants gasifying less than 5,000 tons of coal per annum, the highest average yields ranged from 22 to 59 lb. of sulphate per ton.A marked increase in the average recovery has been obtained by the employment of lime, a small per-centage of hydrated quicklime in the form of a fine powder being intimately mixed with the coal. The process of liming the coal has been tried at a number of works, and the Committee is informed that increased yields of ammonia ranging from somewhat less than 10 per cent, up to about 20 per cent, have always been obtained. The figures quoted for the actual works results at a large plant over a period of two years show an average yield of about 96 lb. of sulphate per ton of coal gasified without the use of lime, and an average yield of about 113 lb. of sulphate per ton from coal of
a similar quality when treated with lime, or an increase of about 18 per cent.Tho results are stated to he inlluenced to a marked extent by the character of the coal and the design of the producer, and also, according to good authority, by the nature of the load factor at which the producer operates. It is clear, therefore, that no definite con-clusions can be drawn as to the effect of the more extended use of the liming process.Future Prospects.The prospects of obtaining an appreciable addition to the present output of ammonia nitrogen from recovery producer plants depend upon the possibility of improving the average yield per ton of coal gasified at a number of existing works, but mainly upon the future demand for power gas.It is reasonable to assume that the average yield throughout the country could be raised at least to the pre-war level by a return to the use of suitable coal. If the scale of operations in 1917 were maintained after the war, the output of ammonia nitrogen from recovery producers would be increased by about 7,760 tons of sulphate per annum, equivalent to about 27 - 8 per cent, of the recorded output from recovery producers in 1917. A further addition would result from any improvements in the practice at the smaller plants or from the adoption of the liming process.There has been a substantial increase in the demand&apos; for power gas during the war both for power station work and for general industrial purposes. In view of the advantages and economies attending the employ -ment of gaseous fuels, there is every prospect of the demand continuing to increase.   The growing appre-ciation of the importance of coal as the principal source of fixed nitrogen in this country, coupled with the fact that a larger proportion of the nitrogen is recoverable by converting coal into power gas under ammonia recovery conditions thau by any other existing process, will also serve to stimulate the employment of recovery pro-ducers. Such plant is already used in conjunction with gas-engines for the production of power on a moderate scale, and further improvements in the design of producers may lead to their employment at larger power stations. It is of interest to observe that if power gas were used instead of raw coal at a single electric supply station having a maximum demand -of 100,000 kw. and an annual load factor of 100 per cent., the gasification of the requisite coal under recovery conditions would have the effect of increasing the home production of ammonium sulphate by as much as from 52,000 to 60,000 tons per annum (Appendix IV.).The producer-gas industry has only been responsible in the past for about 6 or 7 per cent, of the total annual production of ammonia nitrogen, and it is clear that developments must occur on a very large scale before the industry can exert an appreciable influence upon the nitrogen situation in the United Kingdom. If additional plant equivalent to the total rated gasifica-. tion in 1917 were gradually installed and the average yield per ton of coal gasified were maintained at the pre-war level, the home resources might eventally be augmented to the extent of about 35,600 tons of sulphate per annum, equivalent to an increase of about 7&apos;7 per cent, upon the total output from all sources in 1917. Developments on this scale, however, could hardly be expected to materialise for some years after the war.IRONWORKS.The contribution made by ironworks to the total homo production of ammonia nitrogen has been quite small, amounting to somewhat less than 5 per cent, in the pre-war period (average 1911-13) and to about per cent, in 1917. This output was obtained almost entirely from ironworks in Scotland where splint coal .was used in the blast furnaces, as is shown by the following statistics: AMMONIA NITROGEN FROM IRONWORKS.SOURCti.

There has been a general decline in the amount of fixed nitrogen recovered at ironworks since the year 1911, and even if the practice of using raw coal instead of metallurgical coke persists in the future, it is evident that no material contribution to an increased demand could be expected from this source.Although metallurgical coke contains a certain proportion of fixed nitrogen, ranging perhaps up to1 per cent., the researches of various investigators point to the conclusion that it is pai-tly in a stable combination which does not yield ammonia on the application of heat. There would thus appear to be little prospect, under blast furnace conditions, of- con-serving any of the the fixed nitrogen contained in the large quantities of metallurgical coke consumed annually in the United Kingdom, y-       r    .COAL CARBONISING WORKS.STATISTICS FOR MISCELLANEOUS WORKS.In addition to gasworks and coke-oven works, there are some miscellaneous works at which coal is car-bonised and ammonia nitrogen recovered. This branch of the by-product industry is a very small one as is indicated by the statistics in the table opposite.It is obvious that these works could not be expected to provide any effective addition to the home production of ammonia nitrogen.Output of Ammonia Nitrogen expressed, as Tons of Ammonium Sulphate (24 - 5 per cent.

If the average value for all classes of coal is taken at 1 - 2 percent., the annual home consumption of coal in the pre-war period (average 1911-13) represents the equivalent in round figures of 2,200,000 tons*of combined nitrogen, corresponding to 11,000,000 tons of ammonium sulphate.These figures, however, cannot be regarded as a true measure of the potential value of the coal con-sumed annually, as it is not possible by any technical process hitherto devised to recover the whole of the nitrogen content of any class of coal in the form of ammonia, Moreover, the industries in which by-pro-duct ammonia is obtained utilise coals of particular characters, and it has yet to be demonstrated that it is commercially feasible to treat all classes of coal forammonia recovery. In actual practice, the proportion of the combined nitrogen in coal that is recovered as ammonia varies from about 15 to 20 per cent, in the case of the carbonising industries to a maximum of about 70 per cent, in the producer-gas industry.coal consumed in ammonia recovery industries.An approximate idea of the quantity of coal con-sumed per annum in industries responsible for tho production of ammonia&apos; is obtained from the table below, which summarises the figures previously given for the three principal branches of the by-product industry.Statistics are not available for the quantity of raw coal used in blast furnaces and in miscellaneous car-bonising works where ammonia nitrogen was recovered, but the figures are probably small in comparison with the totals for gasworks and coke-ovens.COAL CONSUMED IN AMMONIA recovery INDUSTRIES, 1911-13.Year.

L 3
total, Tho corresponding quantity oi&apos; ammonia nitrogen recovered from the coal represented the equivalent of 338,800 tons of ammonium sulphate.^Taking the average nitrogen content of all classes of coal at 1&apos; 2 per cent.,*the by-product ammonia industry was thus responsible for conserving about 10 per cent, of the nitrogen content of the coal used in that industry or about 3 per cent, of the nitrogen content of the whole of the coal consumed in the United Kingdom for all purposes.The extent to which the potential reserves of nitrogen might be drawn upon in tho immediate future by the expansion of existing industries has already been indicated, and a brief consideration must now be given to the possibilities that would be opened up by successful developments in other directions.Possible Developments.The home consumption of coal outside the principal by-product ammonia industries averaged about 147 million tons per annum in the pre-war period and represented an enormous potential reserve of nitro-genous and other by-products. The problem of rendering a proportion of these by-products available for national requirements has attracted considerable attention, and of the various expedients that have been advocated, proposals for applying by-product recovery to the coal used for domestic purposes and in electrical power stations have attained the greatest prominence.In regard to the domestic consumption, the aim in view is the production of a free-burning smokeless fuel by carbonising coal at a low temperature under by-product recovery conditions, and the eventual use of such a fuel in substitution for raw coal. The fuel would be equally applicable for many industrial pur-poses, while the process of carbonisation itself has a bearing upon the second proposal mentioned above. As the result of a considerable amount of trial work, some of which has been on a large scale, the possibili-ties of low temperature carbonisation as regards the general character of the by-products and the order of the yield have been indicated within limits. The pro-cess, however, has yet to be proved on a full commercial scale, and until this has been done and definite infor-mation secured on&apos; the important questions of costs and average yields, it is only possible to deal on broad lines with its potentialities.The treatment of coal for by-product recovery as a stage in its utilisation for the generation of electrical energy on a large scale forms the subject matter of another appendix (Appendix IV.), in which it is shown how the possibilities are governed by economic factors such as the price of coal and the revenue obtainable from the sale of ammonium sulphate and other by-products.It is of some interest, however, to consider the two proposals from the quantitative point of view in relation to the recovery of fixed nitrogen and other by-products, and the evidence available is therefore &apos; summarised below.Low Temperature Carbonisation.It is claimed for two distinct systems of low temperature carbonisation (hereafter called System a and System b), that the average yields of smokeless fuel and of by-products to be anticipated per ton of coal treated are as follows: iPRODUCTS CLAIMED FOR LOW TEMPERA-TURE CARBONISATION.Products.

According to evidence furnished by actual trials, it appears that smokeless fuel would prove under most conditions as useful for general domestic purposes as an equivalent weight of raw coal.- The quantity of coal consumed in the United Kingdom in 1913 for domestic purposes alone was about 35 million tons, and the production of an equivalent weight of saleable smokeless fuel would involve the carbonisation of approximately 54 million tons of coal. Upon the basis of the yields taken above, the quantities of by-products recoverable by low temperature carbonisation would be as follows: BY-PRODUCTS FROM 54 MILLION TONS OF COAL.By-products and Yields per Ton of Coal.

Lewes (Cantor Lecture, Eoyal Society of Arts, March 23rd, 1908), the tar upon distillation would yield 54 million gallons of motor spirit, ah equal quantity of burning and enriching oil, about 1-6 million tons of fuel oii and 2-7 million tons of pitch.An idea of the scale of the industrial organisation needed for the carrying out of such a scheme is afforded by the fact that the whole of the gasworks and coke-oven works in operation in the United Kingdom in 1913 only carbonised 37 - 5 million tons of coal. The total quantity of fixed nitrogen recovered at such works amounted to the equivalent of about 316,000 tons of ammonium sulphate. Broadly speak-ing, the complete substitution of smokeless fuel for raw coal for domestic purposes would have the effect of augmenting the home production of ammonia nitrogen to an extent at least as great as the total output from gasworks and coke-ovens in 1913, and possibly greater if an average yield of more than 14 lb. of sulphate per ton of coal could be obtained by low temperature carbonisation.If the process were installed on a scale approxi-mating to that of the second largest gas undertaking in the United Kingdom to carbonise, say, 1,120,000 tons of coal per annum, the output of saleable smokeless fuel would be of the order of 728,000 tons, equivalent to about 2 per cent, of the domestic consumption of raw coal, while the quantity of ammonia nitrogen recovered would amount to 7,000 tons of ammonium sulphate. With a yield of 28 lb. of sulphate per ton of coal, as is claimed for one process, the output of sulphate would be doubled, representing just over 3 per cent, of the total home production from all sources in 1917.Developments in the directions indicated may eventually lead to the production of large additional supplies of by-product nitrogen. It is obvious, how-ever, that they can only be of gradual growth even after the possibilities of low temperature carbonisation have been definitely established by full-scale commercial operations.By-Product Recovery at Power Stations.It is estimated that the quantity of coal consumed for the production of motive power in the United Kingdom at the present time amounts to about 80 million tons per annum, and that of this total about 55 million tons could be saved if electric power supply were dealt with on comprehensive lines (Interim Report on electric tower supply in great britain by the Coal Conservation Sub-Committee of the Recon-struction Committee.   Cd. 8880, 1917).
Electricity supply stations and power installa-tions associated with electric tramways and railways accounted for the consumption of about 7 * 25 million tons of coal in 1917-18, and it is in connection with the larger stations of this class that by-product recovery schemes could most advantageously be installed in the event of their commercial feasibility being demonstrated, At such stations the schemes could be operated on a large scale with the maximum economy, and the national resources in nitrogenous and other by -products would be augmented to the largest extent,Assuming that by-product recovery wore applied at a single central supply station having a maximum load of 100,000 kw, and an annual load factor of 100 per cent., the consumption of coal and the yields of by-products per annum would be approximately as follows, for the established and possible methods of treating fuel (Appendix IV.). It is assumed that all the coal is treated for by-product recovery by the system denoted and tho surplus gas or coke or both used for raising steam for the power plant.

The above table reveals a number of interesting points, the most striking being the enormous scale of the plant required even at a single large station for treating the necessary coal. For example, the gasworks installation would approximate to the size of the second largest gas undertaking in the United Kingdom. In the next place, the annual consumption of coal would be. from 32 to 150 per cent in excess of that needed for an equivalent coal-fired station, namely, 650,000 tons. With regard to the potential yield of by-products, it will be seen that the home resources in fixed nitrogen might be augmented to the extent of from 5,600 to 60,000 tons of ammonium sulphate according to the particular system adopted, representing the equivalent of from 1 - 2 to 13 per cent, of the total home production of ammonia nitrogen in 1917.It is clear that the installation of by-product power schemes on a scale sufficient to make a matei-ial contri-bution to the home production of combined nitrogen could only be a gradual process even when such schemes have been demonstrated to be economically sound.Carbonisation of Coal mixed with Peat.Other possibilities have been opened up by the results of some full-scale experiments carried out at a coke-oven plant with charges consisting of mixtures of coking coal and disintegrated peat. The latter con-tained about 18 per cent, of moisture and was prepared by disintegrating ordinary air-dried peat turves. Trials were made with charges containing different proportions of coal and peat. For example, a mixture consisting of 90 per cent, by weight of coal and 10 per ceni by weight of peat produced a coke fuel which was &quot;found to be superior to beehive coke for steel smelting and foundry -work.The most interesting results, however, were those obtained when a charge containing 60 per cent, by weight of coal and 40 per cent, by weight of peat was carbonised at a lower temperature than in ordinary coking practice by maintaining the oven flues at a temperature of about 8750 C. The period of carbonisation -tion was about 14 hours, or about one-half the usual time for coal alone, but as the charge weighed less than an ordinary charge of coal in the ratio of about 5:8, the throughput per oven was about 25 per cent, greater than with coal.Under the above conditions, it was found that the yield of by-products, namely, ammonia and aromatic hydrocarbons of the benzene and toluene series, was not less per ton of fuel charged into the ovens than when using ordinary coking coal alone. As would be expected, however, the yields of coke and of gas were less than from coal alone, the average results being approximately as shown in the first table on the next page.The coke proved to be an excellent&apos; smokeless fuel, well suited for domestic and other purposes, igniting readily and burning with much less flame than coal but giving more radiant heat.The trials already carried out disclose a possible method of obtaining a metallurgical coke and smoke-less fuel for domestic and other purposes under by-product recovery conditions, of conserving coal, and of utilising peat. As the iron and steel industries must have the first call upon available supplies of coking coal, the process may only have a limited sphere cf development in the direction of the manufacture of a domestic fuel. Further, if it were found that the moisture content of the disintegrated peat had to be kept at such a level that open-air drying could not be relied upon for obtaining large supplies of peat of the necessary quality throughout the year, the extensiva

The position of the industry in relation to ammonia production during the pre-war period and in the year 1917 is indicated by the following table: AMMONIA NITROGEN OBTAINED FROM SHALE WORKS, 1911-13.Year.

It should be noted that a certain proportion of the shale mined is used for purposes other than the pro-duction of shale oil, but no definite figures are available on this point.Variations in the Yield of Ammonia.There are very marked variations in the character of the Scottish shales, not only between different seams but also between the parts of the same seam in different areas. The effect of these variations is jndi-cated in the following table which summarises the average yield of ammonium sulphate and crude oil obtainable from different shales by the use of modern retorts and methods of working : YIELD OF SULPHATE AND CRUDE OIL FROM SCOTTISH SHALES.

In the light of the figures in the last table, it is somewhat remarkable that an average yield of the order of 43 lb. of ammonium sulphate per ton of shale distilled should have been maintained so consistently by the industry as a whole over a period of several1 years.Reserves of Scottish Oil-shale.The Committee has been furnished by the Director of the Geological Survey with the following statement upon the estimated reserves of Scottish oil-shale : &quot; The measurements of areas occupied by oil-shales have been based on 6-inch geological maps, and the. thicknesses of the seams have been obtained from the bore-records preserved by the Geological Survey. By multiplying the areas by the average thickness and the mean specific gravity of oil-shales of workable quality, figures were obtained which indicate the total maximum available. Shales less than 3 feet in thickness have been excluded as unworkable, except in a few cases where exceptional quality or favourable situation are likely to render them of practical value. A depth of 300 fathoms has been taken as the present limit of profitable mining; the oil-shale reserves below this depth are not large, and their quality has not yet been ascertained by boring.&quot; In the following table the heading &apos; Proved and Probable Reserves&apos; refers - to areas in which workings on a commercial scale are in progress and to those in which geological conditions are favourable, and in which the existence of workable shale has been proved by borings,   The heading &apos; Possible Reserves &apos; refers to
areas in which the geological conditions are favourable, but which have not yet been proved by borings.&quot; Nearly all the seams lie below the Carboniferous Limestone ; the few that lie above have not been worked for several years. The principal seams now in demand are the Raeburn, Mungle, Pells, Broxburn, Champfleurie, Dunnet, Camps and Pumpherston. Laterally they pass into carbonaceous shale, and in no district are all present in workable development. Vast quantities have been rendered valueless by igneous intrusions.&quot; Lastly, it must be pointed out that the conditions which determine whether a shale can be worked at a profit, fluctuate. The rate of wages, and the relative value of such products as oil, paraffin wax and sulphate of ammonia, are factors to be considered among those conditions.&quot; From 1873 to 1917 the Home Office statistics show that 90,000,000 tons of oil-shale have been raised. Adding 10,000,000 tons for the period 1862 (when the rise in oil-shale mining commenced) to 1872, we get aRESERVES OF SCOTTISH OIL-SHALES.District.	Proved and Probable Reserves.

A further allowance of about 20,000,000 tons may be made for loss in working, making a total deduction of 120,000,000 tons on the amount that exists or has existed.&quot;The present output is approximately 3,000,000 tons a year, and to this may be added 20 per cent, loss in working, making a total yearly depletion of 3,600,000 tons. This indicates 133 years as the duration of the &apos; Proved and Probable Reserves&apos; at the present rate of working. The &apos; Possible Reserves,&apos; if they all proved available, would last for about 245 years under the same conditions.&quot;Future Prospects.In view of the marked improvements in the average yield of ammonia already brought about by the modem methods of retorting shale, there appears to belittle prospect of an increase in the home production of fixed nitrogen in this direction if the shale oil industry merely continues upon the same scale as hitherto.The increasing demand for oil fuel has resulted in considerable attention being given to the problem of augmenting the home production by the distillation of shales found in other parts of the country, and of materials such as cannel, jacks, batts, and bituminous clays. Efforts will doubtless be made after the war to develop the resources of the United Kingdom to a much greater extent than formerly, and may ultimately lead to a large extension of the oil fuel industry. Such developments may be of fairly rapid growth, but even then it would probably be a matter of some years before the present scale of the industry could be doubled. These considerations, coupled with the results of existing practice in Scotland, point to the conclusion that only a gradual addition to the home resources in fixed nitrogen could be expected from the more extended distillation of shale, cannel and the like, for the production of fuel oil.OBSERVATIONS.It is apparent, from the figures p.nd considerations presented above, that the deposits of coal and shale in the United Kingdom constitute a potential source of combined nitrogen capable of meeting practically an unlimited demand. Nevertheless, the development of these resources to a greater extent than hitherto is not merely a question of the demand for fixed nitrogen, but is intimately bound up with other economic considera-tions, such an the future demand for gas for illuminating and heating purposes and for power production, for metallurgical and gasworks coke, for shale oil and other oil fuels, and for products such as tar. In general, it may be said that the requirements of the country in these directions are growing, and notwith-standing the considerable developments that have occurred in some cases during the war, there is likely to be increased progress in the near future..With reference to other possibilities that have been discussed, it is important to remember that all by-product power schemes are handicapped by high prices for coal and by high rates of wages, owing to the thermal losses in carbonisation or gasification and the consequent increase in the quantities of coal to be treated for a given output of power, as compared with direct coal-fizdng.When the conditions become more settled at the termination of the war, the existing by-product ammonia industries, if maintained on their present scale, may furnish an immediate increase in the honie production of perhaps 10,000 tons of ammonium sul-phate, and eventually a much larger addition. It is clear, however, that the developments necessary for increasing the present production to the extent of, say, 25 per cent., or by 100,000 tons of sulphate per annum, would be of such a magnitude that many years would be required to bring them into full operation.There are two other large potential sources of combined nitrogen in the United Kingdom, namely, peat and sewage, and the possibilities in these direc-tions are reviewed in detail in another appendix (Appendix V., Sections XIII. and XIV.).Attention must be drawn to\the difficulties that have been experienced in obtaining Ml and reliablestatistics for the nitrogen industries and associated industries of the United Kingdom. Many of the figures given in this Appendix (and also in Appendix II.) have not previously been published, and the Committee has only been enabled to obtain them through the assistance afforded by Government Departments, and in some cases by direct application to the whole of the firms and undertakings engaged in a particular industry. Other difficulties have been met with in attempting to correlate the statistics published annually by various Government Departments, and without any intention of minimising the value of such publications, it is felt that a brief indication of the nature of such difficulties may prove useful.In the first place, the fundamental statistics for the total home production of ammonia nitrogen in the Annual Reports of the Chief Inspector of Alkali Works to the Local Government Board are supplied to the Chief Inspector &quot;through the courtsey of inanu-facturers.&quot; It is understood that the manufacturers do not include all the producers of ammonia nitrogen. When account is taken of the waste of ammonia at small gasworks, of the losses at many other works, and in the handling, transport and working-up of ammonia liquor, it appears that the annual statistics must represent the available output rather than the actual production. With regard to individual industries, such as the gas and metallurgical coke industries, other official publications revealed the following position. An annual return, issued before the war by the Board of Trade, dealing with a section of the gas industry, namely, with Authorised Undertakings only, specifies the quantity of coal carbonised but does not include figures for the corresponding output of ammonia nitrogen or of coke. On the other hand, the Annual Reports of the Chief Inspector of Mines to the Home Office deal with the gas and metallurgical coke industries as a whole, and although quoting the total output of each class of colce, have not hitherto given separate figures for the quantities of coal carbonised in each industry, but a total for the two industries taken together. It is understood that these statistics are compiled from voluntary returns, and internal evidence
points to the conclusion that they are not quite com-plete, at any rate as far as the gas industry is concerned.When considering the possibilities of the wider application of by-product recovery processes,, the Committee endeavoured to obtain data as to the approximate allocation of the total home consumption of coal among different industries and classes of consumers. No really reliable figures appear to be available on this subject, and estimates submitted with reserve by good authorities exhibited considerable variations. The importance of trustworthy statistics upon coal consumption, and the benefit to industries at large if such statistics could be officially collected and published, were referred to as long ago as 1903 inthe course of evidence given before the Royal Commission on Coal Supplies (2nd Report, Vol. II., Minutes of Evidence, Cd. 1991, 1904, pp. 30 and 38).There is, without question, a clear case for the collection and publication of annual statistics of a much more comprehensive character than those at present available. While it might be inadvisable in some instances to publish more than a&apos; summary, the full details should be available so as to enable the Govern-ment Departments concerned to follow closely the pi-ogress of industries, to see whether the national resources are being utilised to the fullest advantage, and to frame measures for conserving such resources and for allocating them in case of an emergency.

APPENDIX IV.POWER PRODUCTION WITH BY-PRODUCTRECOVERY.INTRODUCTION.Although future developments may result in the harnessing of a substantial amount of water power in the United Kingdom, there is little doubt that the demand for large blocks of power for industrial pur-poses, for example for nitrogen fixation, must be met principally by the utilisation of coal. &apos; Cheap electrical energy is essential not only for the operation of the arc or calcium cyanamide processes, but also for general industrial purposes: from the latter point of view alone it is vital to the future prosperity of the United Kingdom that the generation of electrical energy from coal should be effected with the maximum economy. It is important in this connection to re-member that there has been a continual rise in the price of coal in this country over a period of years, the average price at the pitfs head having increased during the period 1897 to 1910 by no less than 38 per cent. (Interim Report on Electric Power Supply in Great Britain, Coal Conservation Sub-Committee of the&apos; Reconstruction Committee, Cd. 8880, 1917). More-over, every indication points to the conclusion that the price will continue to rise in the future.It has been estimated that 80,000,000 tons of coal are consumed per annum in the United Kingdom at the present time for the production of motive power,and that ah annual saving of 55,000,000 tons of the! above quantity could be effected in the near future if electric power supply were dealt with on comprehensive lines and advantage taken of the most modern engin-eering developments (Cd. 8880, previously quoted). A certain proportion of the coal now consumed in the production of motive power is subjected to preliminary treatment, such as carbonisation or gasification, whereby ammonia, tar and other by-products can be recovered, the resulting coke or gas being utilised in the power plant. There is no question, however, that by far the largest part of the 80,000,000 tons is consumed in the raw state with the total loss of the potential by-products.It is well understood that the centralisation of electric power generation would lead to very sub-stantial economies as compared with existing practice, and the cost of generation by the direct combustion of raw coal in large central supply stations is known within close limits. From the point of view of the nitrogen problem, however, the generation of electrical power in this manner represents a wastage of combined nitrogen, and should therefore be avoided if technically and economically feasible.SYSTEMS OP TREATING FUEL.The question thus arises as to the possibility of conserving nitrogenous and other by-products and at the same time of effecting reductions in the cost of generation at large central stations by submitting the coal to a preliminary treatment, the resulting coke or gas, or both, being used in the power plant in place of raw coal. The various aspects of this question are dealt with in detail in this Appendix in the course of a consideration of the following systems of treating fuel as a preliminary to power production: (a) The carbonisation of coal at high and at low temperatures;(b) The complete gasification of coal and of coke under ammonia recovery conditions; and. (c) Combination schemes involving the car-bonisation of coal as a first stage, followed by the complete gasification of the resulting coke in recovery producers as a second stage.Of these systems, the only ones thoroughly estab-lished upon a large commercial scale are those involving the carbonisation of coal according to gasworks prac-tice and recovery coke-oven practice, and the gasification of coal under ammonia recovery conditions.This Appendix is mainly devoted to an examination of the possibilities of power production on a large scale by the employment of steam turbo-electric plant, since the use of gas engines in a large power station of the size required for the economical operation of nitrogen fixation processes cannot be regarded as an immediate possibility. For moderate blocks of power, however, the gas engine, with a low-priced gaseous fuel, shows to advantage as compared with steam-turbo units of equivalent size. Consideration is given in Section VII. of this Appendix to the possibility of utilising peat under ammonia recovery conditions for the generation of electrical energy on a moderate scale by the use of gas-engine electric plant, and alternatively by the use of steam turbo-electric plant.BASIC DATA.In order to enable a fair comparison to be made of the different methods of power production dealt with later, it is necessary to define the quality and character of the coal employed in each case, to adopt definite figures for the thermal efficiencies of boilers fired with coal, coke and gas respectively, for the scale of the power installation, for the thermal requirements of the steam turbo-electric plant per kw.-hour available, and to employ standard units in terms of which the quantities and costs involved in the various systems can be expressed.Character of Coal.It has been assumed that each process is supplied with coal of the requisite character containing not more than 8 per cent, of moisture, not more than 10 per cent, of ash, and not less than 30 per cent, of volatile, the ash and volatile being reckoned on the dry coal. Moreover, the nitrogen content has been taken at 13 per cent., and the nett calorific value ofthe coal as fired at 12,000 B.Th.U. per lb., corresponding to a total calorimetric value of, say, 13,500 B.Th.U. per lb. on the dry sample.Thermal Efficiencies of Boilers.The figures adopted for the thermal efficiencies of boilers with superheaters and economisers (the com-bination being considered as a single unit) when fired with the various classes of fuel obtained in by-product recovery schemes and working under average conditions in a power station are summarised in the table on the next page. In view of the thermal advantages possessed by gas-fired boilers of the surface combustion type and of the possible development of high-pressure boilers of this class suitable for use in large power stations, alternative figures have been taken throughout in schemes involving gas-firing, in order to indicate the modifications that would result if a thermal efficiency of 90 per cent, could be realised.

The problem of applying the principle of surface combustion to a high-pressure gas-fired boiler with superheater and feed-water heater is dealt with in some detail in Section VIII. of this Appendix.Power Plant.Scale. The various by-product schemes are con-sidered in relation to the generation of power on a scale of 100,000 kw. maximum load at an annual load factor of 100 per cent., the power plant having an installed capacity of 125,000 kw. and comprising five steam turbo-electric generator units, each of 25,000 kw. capacity, one being in reserve.Fuel Requirements. The total fuel requirements of a power plant of the scale just defined and of its auxiliaries are determined on the assumption that a kw.-hour for external use can be produced by supplying 20,000 B.Th.U. to the grate of boilers having a thermal efficiency of 80 per cent.  The corresponding figuresfor boilers having efficiencies of 75 and 90 per cent, are 21,330 B.Th,U. and 17,780 B.Th.TJ. respectively. In the case of direct firing with coal having a calorific value of 12,000 B.Th.U. per lb., a consumption of 20,000 B.Th.TJ. per unit output represents fi&apos; 5 tons of coal per kw.-year of 8,760 hours. This figure has been used throughout in contrasting direct firing with by-product recovery schemes.Capital Cost. The capital cost of the power plant, including buildings and land, has been taken as in the Report at  10*26 per kw, of maximum load. The boiler section of the plant, with its superheaters, reheaters, feed heaters, mechanical stokers and the like, accounts for  2*25 of the above total.Operating Costs. The operating costs, inclusive of capital charges at 9-5 per cent., but exclusive of the cost of coal, have also been taken as in the Report at  1145 per kw.-year of 8,760 hours. The additional charge for coal of 12,000 B.Th.TJ. per lb. brings the total cost per kw.-year by direct firing to a somewhat higher figure than that given in the Report, the latter being based upon coal of 12,500 B.Th.U. per lb., i.e., upon a consumption of 6-25 tons per full kw.-year.All figures for costs throughout this Appendix are taken on a pre-war basis.Units of Comparison.The kilowatt and the kilowatt year have been adopted as the units in terms of which the quantities and costs involved in the various by-product power schemes are expressed. By means of the conversion chart (Chart 1) which is given opposite, the equivalent costs of electrical energy per e.h.p.-year and per unit can be readily determined.METHOD OF INVESTIGATION.In dealing with each system, figures are given for the gross yield of fuel products and by-products per unit weight of fuel treated, for the fuel utilised in meeting the plant requirements, for the surplus fuel available for power production, and for the thermal efficiency of the complete by-product plant. The use of the surplus fuel in the power plant is then considered, figures being given for the overall thermal efficiency of the by-product and power installation as compared with that of a direct-fired power station, and for the total quantity of coal required per kw.-year available at the switchboard. The latter figure determines the capacity of the by-product section needed for supplying a kw.-year.It is considered on good authority that a reserve equivalent to 15 per cent, of the carbonisation or gasifi-cation plant in actual operation would be sufficient for the running of a power station of the size previously specified, and this figure has been adopted in each scheme. It may be recalled that the reserve of power plant represents the equivalent of 25 per cent, of the running plant.The total capital outlay per kw. of maximum load (i.e., inclusive of reserve plant), and the total operating costs (exclusive of the cost of fuel) are obtained by adding the corresponding costs for the power and by-product sections of the installation.It should be particularly noted that no attempt has been made to enter into detailed adjustments in capital and operating costs such as would be caused by the partial or total replacement of coal-firing by gas-firing. These adjustments would vaiy for each system of power production, and would not result in any sub-stantial modification in the approximate figures given in detail in the subsequent sections.Account is&quot; taken of the nett revenue derivable from the sale of by-products and of the cost of the necessary fuel. These figures enable the nett cost of electrical energy per kw.-year to be obtained, and a chart is given for each system indicating its financial relation to direct firing with coal at various prices and with different nett values of ammonium sulphate. In order to avoid the complications that would otherwise ensue, it has been assumed that the market values of the other by-products, such as tar and benzol, would be maintained and would not exhibit fluctuations of the kind that might occur in the case of ammonium sulphate.


\appendix IV.171SECTION I.HIGH TEMPERATURE CARBONISATION.The extensive scale of the gasworks and coke-oven industries in this country and the experience gained in their development have provided data from which the possibilities attaching to the application of high temperature carbonisation to power production can be estimated with close accuracy.These industries are characterised by a number of distinctive features, and are therefore dealt with under separate headings.(a). GASWORKS PRACTICE.The information summarised below concerning the application of modern gasworks practice to power production is based upon figures supplied to the Com-mittee from authoritative sources.Yield of Products.The yield of products from the carbonisation of a ton of coal of the quality specified on page 169 is given as follows: YIELD OP PRODUCTS PER TON OF COAL.Products.	Yield per Ton of Coal.Coal-gas (stripped) -Coke and breeze Ammonium sulphate Tar Crude naphtha (-1 gals.) from stripping of gas, yielding: Benzol  -Toluol   -	12,000 cu. ft. (500 B.Th.U.)&apos; 13* 5 cwt. 25 lb. 10 gals. 2-5 gals. 0-5 gals.The figure for coke and breeze is a gross value, and is subject to deductions for the requirements of the carbonising plant as indicated later. It is stated, however, on high authority, that with the best modern regenerative plant, the yield of coke and breeze speci-fied above would be obtained for sale, i.e., would be a nett value after allowing for the requirements of the plant.Requirements of Carbonising Plant.The fuel required for heating the retorts amounts to 2 cwt. of coke per ton of coal carbonised. The calorific value of the coke obtained from a coal of the quality specified is 11,000 B.Th.U. (nett) per lb., so that the requirements represent the equivalent of 2-46 x 106 B-ThU.The power requirements of a modern large-scale gasworks for crushing the coal, handling and conveying the coal and coke, charging and discharging the retorts, and similar operations are from 1 - 5 to 2 kw.-hours per ton of coal carbonised per day, accoi-ding to the type of plant installed. In the case, therefore, of a gasworks carbonising about 500,000 tons of coal per annum, a continuous supply of 90 to 120 kw. would be needed and could be obtained from the power station with which the carbonising plant was associated.The working-up of gas liquor on a large scale for the preparation of solid ammonium sulphate entails1 the use of 1 - 3 lb. of coke per lb. of sulphate obtained. The fuel requirements for the sulphate stage per ton of coal carbonised therefore represent the equivalent of 25 x 1-3 x 11,000    0.-36 x 105 B.Th.UThermal Balance Sheet for Carbonisation Plant.With coal of the character previously defined, the relation between the thermal units in the coal and those available for power production after the require-ments of the process have been met, is indicated in the balance sheet given in the next column. No account has been taken of the power requirements of the carbonisation installation..THERMAL BALANCE SHEET.Gasworks Practice.Data.

The table on the next page shows the overall thermal efficiency of the complete power installation as corn-pared with that of a direct coal-fired station, and also the total fuel consumption per kw-year available.The comparative overall thermal efficiency of the power scheme is arrived at in the following manner: In one instance, 6-0 x 106 B.Th.U. in the form of gas and 13-81 X 106 B.Th.U in the form of coke are utilised under the power station boilers at thermal efficiencies of 75 per cent, as compared with 80 per cent, for direct firing, i.e., at a relative&quot; efficiency of 75 -f- iSO zzi 0-9375. Since the thermal efficiency of the carbonisation section itself is 73-7 per cent., the comparative overall thermal efficiency becomes 73-7 X 0-9375 zz 69-1 per cent.In the other case, 6 - 0 X 106 B.Th.U. in the form of gas are used at a relative thermal efficiency of 90 80 1-125, and 13-81 x 10&quot; B.Th.U. in the form of coke at a relative thermal&apos; efficiency  of
75 -7- 80 = 0- 9375, so that tho mean relative efficiency for the total B.Th.U. used in the power station amounts to6-0 x 1-125 -f- 13-81 x 0-9375 _ ft.QQ.The comparative overall thermal efficiency thus becomes 73-7 x 0-994 - 73-2 per cent.A similar procedure has boon adopted in obtaining the figures given in subsequent sections of this Appendix,POWER PRODUCTION via HIGH TEMPERATURE CARBONISATION.Gasworks Practice,Boinisu Efficiencies.

The effect of the higher efficiency upon the financial aspects of the system is dealt with later.The salient point revealed by the above table is that the application of gasworks practice to power production on a large scale would involve the con-siumption of from 37 to 45 per cent, more coal than that required for an equivalent coal-fired power station.Capital Cost.The pre-war capital cost of a large-scale gasworks for treating over 500,000 tons of coal per annum is placed at  350 per ton of coal carbonised per day, i-e., per 365 tons per annum. The installation includes retort houses complete, coal and coke handling plant, cpal store, overhead hoppers, stoking machinery, power house and plant, condensers and exhausting plant, washers and scrubbers, holders for 4 - 5 hours storage, pumps, steam boilers, buildings, liquor and tar storage, sulphate plant and buildings, paving, drainage, fencing, meters, tools and appurtenances, and mains on the works, but no spare plant. With the addition of reserve plant equivalent to 15 per cent, of the running plant, the capital outlay becomes  1 -103 per ton of coal carbonised per annum.Upon the basis of the figures for coal consumption given in the previous table, the capital cost of the carbonising section only of a complete power installa-tion would be as follows : CAPITAL COST OF GASWORKS SECTION.Efficiency of Gas-fikino.	-        .     i   per kw. of maximum load, j 1(a) 75 per cent. -     -(//) 90 per cent. -	0-4 at  1-103 =  10-87  1 8-9 at  1-103 =   9-82  i 1.As compared with a capital outlay of  10-26 per kw. of maximum load for a direct coal-fired station having a running capacity of 100,000 kw., the total cost of an equivalent station utilising high temperature carbonisation for the preliminary treatment of the fuel would thus amount to  20-63 or  20-08 per-kw. of maximum load.Operating Costs.Upon the basis of figures that have already been realised in large-scale gasworks practice, the working expenses for carbonising, handling the coal and coke and purifying the gas, together with salaries, maintenance, and repairs, are placed at 4s. per ton of coal cai-bonised. It is considered on high authority that in the case of a large works embodying all the best modern features, the expenses would be reduced to 3s. 6d. per ton, and this figure is utilised in dealing with the possible cost of electrical energy via high temperature carbonisation. The costs incurred in working up the by-products, such as ammonium sulphate, are accounted for separately in considering the revenue derivable from their sale.The operating costs for the carbonisation section of a large power station per kw.-year of 8,760 hours would then be as follows : OPERATING COSTS OF GASWORKS SECTION.Items.	  per full Kw.-year, with Gas-firing Efficiency of:              ,		75 per cent.	90 per cent.Working expenses Capital charges at 10 per cent. Total	9-4 at  0-175=161 -64  1-04	8-9 at  0-175 = ^1-56  0-98	 2-68	 2-54Apart from the cost of fuel, the working expenses of the power station itself, inclusive of capital charges, are estimated to amount to  1 - 45 per kw.-year of 8,760 hours. For the complete carbonising and power instal-lation, the operating costs would therefore amount to  4-13 and  3-99 respectively per full kw.-year.Revenue from By-Produets.Under pre-war conditions, the value of gasworks tar to an installation without distilling plant amounted to about 2d. per gallon, and this figure has been adopted. The nett revenue from benzol and toluol after allowing for the expenses of recovery and rectification has been taken at 8d. per gallon. In dealing with the value of ammonium sulphate, which may be expected to fluctuate in price to a greater extent than the other by-products, the varying figures given later, both in the present scheme and in subsequent schemes, in all cases repre-sent nett revenue after full deductions have been made for the costs incurred in the recovery and sulphate operations.It may be noted that the pre-war cost of working-up crude gas liquor on a large scale for the manufacture of sulphate at a works making the necessary sulphuric
acid amounted to about  3 per ton of sulphate. This figure is inclusive of the cost of sulphuric (chamber) acid at  1 per ton, of fuel (coke) at 7s. Gd. per ton, of lime at 10s. per cubic yard, of labour, repairs and general charges, and of interest on capital at the rate of 5 per cent.Possible Cost of Electrical Energy.The financial possibilities of power production by high temperature carbonisation according to modern gasworks practice depend upon the extent to which the total working costs, including the cost of the increasedquantity of coal that has to be employed, are off-set by the nett revenue from the sale of the by-products.By way of example, a balance sheet is set out below to illustrate the possibilities when the cost of coal amounts to 10s. per ton and the nett revenue from the sale of ammonium sulphate to  10 per ton. A chart is also given (Chart 2) to show the influence of the cost of coal up to a price of  1 per ton, and the influence of a netb revenue from sulphate varying between the limits of  6 and  12 per ton. For pur-poses of comparison, the chart includes a line showing the cost of electrical energy by direct coal-firing with varying prices of coal.&quot;       COST OF ENERGY via HIGH TEMPERATURE CARBONISATION.Gasworks Practice.Items.Financial Results in   per full Kw.-year, with Gas-firing Efficiency of :75 per cent.90 per cent.Debit:Working expenses.-Of  carbonising   and   power plants,   including   capital charges.

In the case of direct firing, a similar increase in the price of coal makes a difference of 6-5s. per kw.-year. A variation in the market price of ammonium sulphate to the extent of  1 per ton of sulphate modifies the nett revenue, and hence the nett cost of electrical energy, by about 2s. per kw.-year.With ammonium sulphate at the nett values of  10 and  12 per ton, and the other by-products at the nett values previously indicated, the maximum prices of coal at which the carbonisation scheme could compete on an equality with direct firing (with coal at the same price) are shown in the table in the next column, assuming-ing, as before, an efficiency of 75 per cent, for gas-firing.The limiting prices of coal are so low, even with a high nett revenue per ton of ammonium sulphate, that it is obvious the process cannot be regarded as acompetitor of direct firing for the generation of cheap electrical energy.The process is handicapped by the large capital outlay required, and from the point of view of the conservation of nitrogen, the amount of ammonium sulphate recovered would only represent about one-sixth of the total nitrogen content of the coal employed.Reference is made in a later section (Section YX) to the possible effect of improvements in existing practice at gasworks.LIMITING PRICES OF COAL.Nett Revenue per Ton of Sulphate.

RECOVERY COKE-OVEN PRACTICE.In considering the application of modern recovery coke-oven practice to power production on a large scale, it is important to remember that the average -results would show some variation according to theU  0619locality of the installation, principally on account of differences in the character of the coals available. The Committee has been furnished with complete details of the average practice in different parts of the&quot;M
country, but has considered it unnecessary to investi-gate more than a single case. The figures summarised below are intended to apply to the operation of a large-scale installation under the conditions obtaining in the north of England.Yield of Products.The yield of products from a coal of the quality previously specified (p. 169) is given as follows : YIELD OF PRODUCTS PER TON OF COAL.THERMAL BALANCE SHEET.

The total re-quirements vary somewhat according to the system of ammonia recovery adopted, but on an average about 40 per cent, of the gross yield of gas will be available for external use.Thermal Balance Sheet for Coke-Oven Plant.With a coal of the quality specified, the relation between the thermal units in the coal and those avail-able for power production after the requirements of the coking and recovery operations have been met is indicated in the balance sheet in the next column.&apos; data;&quot;!

The figures for the comparative overall thermal efficiency of the power scheme have been obtained as indicated when dealing with gasworks practice.POWER PRODUCTION via HIGH TEMPERATURE CARBONISATION.Recovery Coke-oven Practice.Boiler Efficiencies.

It has been considered unnecessary to indicate in detail the modifications that would result from the higher efficiency, as the figures are readily obtainable on the lines of the examples given when dealing with gasworks practice.Capital Cost.The capital cost of a large recovery coke-oven plant comprising 100 ovens in two batteries, for carbonising 200,750 tons of coal per annum, is placed at  115,000.


With the addition of reserve plaint equivalent to 15 per cent, of the running plant, the capital cost becomes equivalent to  0- 659 per ton of coal carbonised per annum.According to the first set of figures quoted in the previous table, the capital cost of the coke-oven section of a complete power installation would thus amount to 9-4 X  0&apos;659 rz:  6-19 per kw. of maximum load.As compared with a capital outlay of  10&apos; 26 per kw. of maximum load for a direct coal-fired station having a running capacity of 100,000 kw., the total cost of an eqiiivalent station utilising recovery coke-oven practice for the preliminary treatment of the fuel would thus amount to  16- 45 per kw. of maximum load.Operating Costs.In the case of a large-scale plant, the working ex-penses for carbonising, handling the coal and coke, and the recovery of by-products, including labour, salaries, materials (sulphuric acid being purchased at 30s. per ton), stores, general expenses, repairs, and maintenance, but exclusive of capital charges, may be taken, at 3s. per ton of coal carbonised. Of this total, the cost of recovering ammonium sulphate, tar, and crude benzol accounts for about Is. In dealing later with the question of revenue from the sale of by-products, the figures adopted for ammonium sulphate and benzol represent nett values after allowance for the costs of recovery.On this basis, the expenses incurred in connection with the coke-oven section of a complete power in-stallation would be as follows per kw.-year: OPERATING COSTS OF COKE-OVEN SECTION.Items.	  per full kw.-year.

For the complete coke-oven and power installation the operating costs would therefore amount to  3-01 per full kw.-year.Revenue from By-Products.The value of coke-oven tar has been taken at  1 per ton, and the nett revenue from benzol, after allowing for the expenses of recovery and rectification, at 8d. per gallon. The nett value of the ammonium sulphate, after full deductions have been made for all the costs incurred in the recovery Operations, such as for acid, is taken at varying figures as in dealing with the financial aspects of gasworks practice.It may be noted that the pre-war cost of obtaining ammonium sulphate (with sulphuric acid purchased at 30s. per ton) at large coke-oven plants ranged from  2 - 25 to  2 - 5 per ton of sulphate, according to the system of recovery adopted.Possible Cost of Electrical Energy.The financial possibilities of power production by high temperature carbonisation according to modern recovery coke-oven practice are indicated in a balance sheet in the next column and upon a chart (Chart 3).The table is based upon a nett revenue of  10 per ton from the sale of ammonium sulphate, the price of coal being taken at 10s. per ton. Chart 3 indicates the influence of variations in the price of coal up to  1 per ton, and of variations in the nett revenue from ammonium sulphate between the limits of  6 and 12 per ton, In each case the thermal efficiency of gas-firing is taken at 75 per cent. For purposes of comparison, the chart includes a line showing the cost of electrical energy by direct coal-firing with varying prices of coal.COST OF ENERGY via HIGH TEMPERATURE CARBONISATION.Recovery Colte-oven Practice.Items.

SECTION II.LOW TEMPERATURE CARBONISATIONThe information available concerning low tempera-ture carbonisation is not of an authoritative character like that upon other methods of treating fuel for by-product recovery, because there is no established com-mercial practice in this country upon which definite and reliable data can be based.The figures summarised below have been claimed as representative of the average results of much experi-mental work upon two distinct systems of low tempera -ture carbonisation. One process is carried out under reduced pressui-e, and in the other the gaseous products are submitted to special treatment to promote the formation of benzol. Pending the confirmation of the results in full-scale commercial operations, the claims made can only be taken as indicating the possibilities of the systems.Yield of Products.The average yield of products from a coal of the quality specified is claimed to be as follows for the two systems of carbonisation: YIELD OF PRODUCTS PER TON OF COAL.the carbonising plant, as indicated later. The yields, of ammonium sulphate and benzol claimed to be obtainable in the operation of System B are worthy of special note. The estimated yield of sidphate is on a parity with that obtained hi the best gasworks practice, but the general experience hitherto has been that benzol is not obtained in any appreciable quantity by carbonising coal at a low temperature.Requirements of Carbonising Plant.The fuel requirements for heating the low tem-temperature retorts are given as follows for the two systems: FUEL REQUIREMENTS FOR RETORTS.System.

It. is probable, however, that they would be of the same order as those of a modern gasworks.Thermal Balance Sheet for Carbonising Plant.With a coal of the character previously defined, the relation between the thermal units in the coal and those available for power production after the requirements of the process have been met, is indicated in the following balance sheet.THERMAL BALANCE SHEET FOR LOW TEMPERATURE CARBONISATION.Data.B.Th.U. per Ton of Coal Carbonised.System a.System b.Thermal value of original coal as fired.Thermal value (nett) of products Stripped gas -Low temperature, coke26-88 x 108Plant requirements :Coke or gas for heating retorts, expressed in B.Th.U.4,500 cubic feet at 450B.Th.U.

APPENDIX IV. : LOW TEMPERATURE CARBONISATION.177In view of the tentative character of the figures, no account has been taken of the power requirements for operations such as handling and conveying the coal and coke, or of the requirements of the ammonia recovery plant.It will be seen by reference to the table on p. 171 that the thermal efficiency of low temperature carboni-sation is on a parity with that of modern gasworks practice.Application to Power Production.In considering the application of Systems A and B to power production on a large scale, the figures con-tained in the thermal balance sheet must be taken in conjunction with those previously given for the thermal efficiencies of power station boilers fired with low temperature coke and gas. The table set out below shows the overall thermal efficiency of the complete power installation as compared with that of a direct coal-fired station, and also the total fuel consumption per lew.-year available. Since the requirements of the carbonising plant itself have to be deducted from the gross yield of coke and gas, it has been assumed that the fuel which is least efficient from the point of view of steam-raising would be employed for heating the retorts. The comparative overall thermal efficiencies have been calculated as in previous cases.POWER PRODUCTION via LOW TEMPERATURE CARBONISATION.

The gross yield of gas from coal carbonised at a low temperature is substantially less than that obtained by modern gasworks or recovery coke-oven practice. On account of the small extent to which gas-firing enters into the production of power, the employment of gas-fired boilers having a thermal efficiency of 90 per cent, instead of 75 per cent, would lead to a very small economy of fuel in the case of System A, and only to a moderate gain in the case of System B.The salient point revealed by the above table is that the application of low temperature carbonisation to power production on a large scale may involve the consumption of from 27 to 39 per cent, more coal than that required for an equivalent coal-fired power station.The figures for costs set out below are based in all cases upon a thermal efficiency of 75 per cent, for gas-firing.Capital Cost.The estimates of capital expenditure that have been put forward in connection with low temperature car-bonisation plant vary from about  180 to  250 per ton of coal carbonised per day, i.e., per 365 tons per annum. Pending further commercial experience with the process, ithere is no means of checking these figures except roughly by analogy with the known cost of gasworks and coke-oven installations. The second figure quoted above has been provisionally adopted; with the addition of an allowance of 15 per cent, for reserve plant, it is equivalent to a capital outlay of  0-788 per i ton of coal carbonised per annum.Upon the basis of the maximum figures for coal consumption set out. in the previous. fable, the capital U  6619cost of the carbonising section only of a complete power station would be as follows: -CAPITAL COST OF CARBONISING- SECTION.System.	  per kw. of Maximum Load.System A -System B -	9-0 at  0-788 =  7-09 8-6 at,. 0-788 =  6-78As compared with a capital outlay of  10-26 per kw. of maximum load for a direct coal-fired station having a running capacity of 100,000 kw., the total cost of an equivalent station utilising low temperature carbonisation for the preliminary treatment of the fuel would thus amount to  17-35 or  17-04 per kw. of maximum load on the basis of the provisional figures taken above.Operating Costs.The working costs of a low temperature plant constitute a very important factor in the general economy of a method of power production of the kind under consideration. Unfortunately, the information available upon, this question is scanty, and extended commercial experience is necessary before reliable figures can be established. In a detailed estimate supplied to the Committee, the working costs are placed at about 2s. 9d. per ton of coal carbonised, inclusive of labour, repairs, maintenance, and general charges. In the absence of confirmatory evidence, this figure, which may be compared with those of 3s. 6d. -for gasworks practice and 2s. for coke-oven practice, has been utilised for the purpose of com-completing the examination of the possibilities of low temperature carbonisation.

COMMITTEE : FINAL - REPORT.Upon the basis of the figures previously given, the operating costs of the carbonising section of a large power station per kw.-year of 8,760 hours would be as follows: OPERATING COSTS OF CARBONISING SECTION.Items.	j   per full kw.-year.

For the complete carbonising and power installation, the operating costs would therefore amount to  3-39 or  3&apos;31 respectively per full kw.,-year.Revenue from By-Products.The. value of low temperature tar is claimed to be higher than that of gasworks tar, and the estimates under review place the nett revenue obtainable for this by-product at 3d. per gallon. This figure haB been provisionally adopted. The nett revenue from benzol and light spirit, after allowing for the costs of recovery and rectification, has been taken at 8d. per gallon, and the value of the ammonium sulphate is desalt with below as in the case of high temperature car-bonisation.Possible Cost of Electrical Energy.The financial possibilities of power production on a large scale by low temperature carbonisation are indi-cated below in a balance sheet and upon charts (Charts 4 and 5). The table is based upon a coal price of 10s. per ton and a nett revenue of  10 per ton from ammonium sulphate. The charts show the effect of variations in the price of coal and in the nett revenue from sulphate, and also the corresponding costs of electrical energy by direct coal-firing with coal at different prices. The thermal efficiency of gas-firing is taken at 75 per cent, in each case.COST OF ENERGY via LOW TEMPERATURE CARBONISATION.Items.	Financial Results in   per full kw.-year,		System A.	System B,Debit.

A variation in the market price of ammonium sulphate to the extent of  1 per ton of sulphate modifies the nett revenue, and hence the nett cost of electrical energy, by 1 - Is. per kw.-year in the case of System A and by about 2 - 2s. in the case of System B.With ammonium sulphate at the nett values of  6,  8,  10 and  12 per ton, and the other by-products at the nett values previously taken, the maximum prices of coal at which the two systems of carbonisation could compete on an equality with direct-firing (with coal at the same price) are shown in the table opposite.As compared with high temperature carbonisation, the limiting prices of coal for the low temperature systems show to better advantage, especially in the case of System B.LIMITING PRICES OF COAL.Nett Revenue per ton of Sulphate.

Prom the point of view of the conservation of nitrogen, the yield of ammonium sulphate is equivalent to about one-tenth of the total nitrogen content of the coal employed.The case is quite different as foreshadowed by System B, mainly on account of the yields of benzol and ammonium sulphate that are claimed to be obtain-able, and the limiting prices of coal would afford a substantial margin for competition with direct firing, even with a moderate or small nett revenue per ton of ammonium sulphate. The possibility of obtaining electrical energy at a cost substantially, lower than that realisable by direct firing is thus foreshadowed, providing that the yields claimed to be obtainable by System B and the estimated costs of operation can be definitely established by full-scale commercial practice extending over an adequate period. It is important to note that the nett revenue from thesale of benzol, which has been taken at M. per gallon, enters into the financial economy of the system to the extent of  1-29 per kw.-year, and thus has a material influence in reducing the nett cost of energy to the figures given above. Failing an average yield of 4-5 gallons of benzol and 28 lb. of ammonium sulphate per ton of coal of the character defined, it is clear that the prospects of System B would be much less favour-able and might in fact become no better than those of System A.The amount of ammonium sulphate claimed to be recoverable by System B represents the equivalent of one-fifth of the nitrogen content of the coal employed.The estimated capital outlay for a large-scale power installation comprising plant for carbonising the whole of the coal at a low temperature is of the order of  17-35 (System A) to  17-04 (System B) per kw. of maximum load, or an increase of about 70 per cent, on that of an equivalent coal-fired station, namely,  1.0 26 per kw. of maximum load.
SECTION III.GASIFICATION OF COAL IN RECOVERYPRODUCERS.Of all the commercial methods of treating fuel for by-product recovery, the process of converting coal into power gas with the aid of air and an excess of steam enables the highest proportion of the combined nitrogen in the. coal to be recovered. Experience has established the fact that about 70 per cent, of the nitrogen can be obtained regularly in the form of ammonia or ammonium sulphate by the gasification of a suitable coal in recovery producers operating at a  airly steady load. Such results, however, depend upon the addition of a large amount of steam to the air blast of the producer, and the maximum recovery has Mtherto been obtained when the quantity of steam Employed is sufficient to saturate the air at a tempera-ture of about 850 O, the air and steam being further heated to a temperature of from 180o C. to 230o C. before admission to the fuel bed.By the employment of suitable regenerative arrange-&apos; ments, much of the sensible heat of the gas leaving the, producer is utilised for raising steam for the blast and for providing the necessary superheat. The heat recoverable from the gas in this way, however, is in-sufficient for meeting the total steam requirements, and the balance has to be provided from other sources. This balance constitutes an important item in the thermal economy of recovery producers, and numerous efforts have been made to render such plants self-supporting in respect of steam by the addition to the producers themselves of heat recovery arrangements in the form of water-jackets or boilers. It has been shown that a reduction can be effected in the nett steam requirements by expedients of this kind, but it has not yet been demonstrated in commercial working that sufficient steam can be raised in the recovery producer plant itself to give the maximum yield of ammonia.In dealing,, therefore, with the problem of power production by the gasification of coal, attention will be confined to methods of operation and types of pro-ducers that have hitherto given the maximum yield of ammonium sulphate in large scale commercial practice. The information summarised below is based upon data supplied by the makers and users of such recovery producers. - --------Yield of Products.The average yield of products from the gasification of a ton of coal of the character specified on page i3 given as follows :    *       -YIELD OP PRODUCTS PER TON OP COAL.Products.	Yield pkr Ton of Coal.Power Gas -Ammonium sulphate -Tar (dehydrated)	135,000 cu. ft. (135 R.Th.U.) 95 lb. 0-05 ton      11 gals.)The figure for power gas is a gross value and is subject to deductions for the requirements of the producer plant as indicated later. &quot;With regard to ammonium sulphate, the yield is equivalent to some-what less than 70 per cent, of the nitrogen content ofthe coal which has been taken at 113 per cent.; a recovery of 70 per cent, would give 99 lb. of sulphate (25 per cent. NH3) per ton of coal. The figure for the yield of tar is in accordance with data supplied by the users of large recovery producer installations.Requirements of Producer Plant.In large-scale commercial practice, the maximum yield of ammonium sulphate is obtained by the use of from 215 to 2 - 75 tons of low-pressure steam in the blast per ton of coal gasified. Of this quantity, from 1 to 1- 25 tons can be raised by regenerative arrange-ments in the plant, leaving a nett quantity of 1 * 5 tons to be supplied from external sources.A further quantity of low-pressure steam is required for evaporating the ammonium sulphate liquor in order to obtain a solid marketable product. If modern vacuum evaporators are employed, the steam require-ments amount to 1-125 lb. per lb. of water evaporated. Since the recovery of 1 lb. of dry salt from the liquor of about360 Tw.,containing approximately 30 percent, of sulphate, necessitates the evaporation of 217 lb. of water, the steam requirements for the sulphate stage amount to 1 -125 x 2 - 7 X 95 = 288 - 5 lb. per ton of coal gasified.The nett quantity of low-pressure steam to be supplied from external sources for meeting the requirements of the blast and of the sulphate opera-tions thus amounts to l-63 tons per ton of coal gasified.The actual power requirements of a recovery pro-producer installation in respect of elevators, pumps, blowers, and the like, are not very large, amounting to about 30 kw.-hours per ton of coal gasified per day. In the case of a plant dealing with 200,000 tons of coal per annum, a continuous supply of about 700 kw. would be needed if the requirements were met electrically, and could be obtained from the large power station with which the recovery producer plant would le associated.Thermal Balance Sheet for Producer Plant.The gross yield of power-gas obtained by the gasifi-cation of one ton of coal of the character previously specifiedl amounts to 135,000 cu. ft., the nett calorific value of the gas being 135 B.Th.U. per cu. ft. The total calorific value of the gas obtained per lb. of coal is therefore 8,136 B.TLU. A certain proportion of the gas obtained per ton of coal has to be utilised for raising l-63 tons of steam for the producer plant, and the balance is available for power production.Consideration has been given to the two following methods of obtaining the low-pressure steam required for the plant: Method A. By raising it in separate gas-fired boilers at a gauge pressure of 5 lb. per square inch.Method B. By tapping it from a low-pressure stage of the condensing turbines of the power station at a gauge pressure of 5 lb. per square inch.In this case, it has been assumed that the whole of the steam passed into the turbines is raised at a gauge pressure of 200 lb. per squaie in., and has a total temperature of 650o P., i.e., a superheat of 2602 P.
In the event of the steam being raised in low-pres-sure gas-fired boilers, the thermal balance sheet would oe as follows : THERMAL BALANCE SHEET. Method A.Data.

The gaseous fuel needed for raising this extra steam must be debited against the producer plant in respect of the steam requirements of the latter. The thermal balance-sheet in this case is approximately as follows : THERMAL BALANCE SHEET. Method B.Data.	B.TH.U. PER lb.

Taking, as an example, the case in which the gas-fired boilers of the power station have a thermal efficiency of 75 per cent., thus normally requiring the supply of 21,330 B.Th.U. for the production of a kw.-hour for external use, the results have been obtained in the following manner : The heat in 1 lb. of steam at a gauge pressure of 200 lb. per square inch and at a temperature of 650o F. amounts to 1,327 B.Th.U. The heat in the steam reaching the condenser with a dryness factor of 0 - 825 amounts to 925 B.Th.U., so that 402 B.Th.U. are given up per lb. of steam passing through the turbine to the i condenser. The steam tapped off at a gauge pressure of 5 lb. per square inch has a dryness factor of 0-964, the heat in the steam amounting to 1,117 B.Th.U. per lb. Neglecting the dryness factor, 210 B.Th.U. are therefore given up in the turbine by each lb. of steam taken for the producer installation.The power gas obtained by the gasification of 1 lb. of coal contains 8,136 B.Th.U., and the high-pressure steam raised by the gas at an efficiency of 75 per cent, contains 6,102 B.Th.U. The steam raised per lb. of coal gasified amounts to 6,102 -f- 1,327 4-6 lb., and of this quantity, 1 - 63 lb. is tapped off from the turbines and 2-97 lb. passes to the condenser. The average amount of heat given up in the turbine per lb. of steam entering is thus equivalent toIn order to maintain the full output of the power plant, the quantity of steam entering the turbine must be increased in the ratio of 402 : 333-9, i.e., of 120 - 4 100. The B.Th.U. required at the grate of the boiler for producing a kw.-hour thus amount to 21,330 X 1-204 zz 25,680 B.Th.U., necessitating the gasification of 25,680 -f- 8,136 zz 3-156 lb. of coal.When the steam needed for the producer plant is derived from the main turbines in the manner indicated, the thermal requirements of the power plant are therefore increased by 25,680 - 21,330 zz 4,350 B.Th.U. per kw.-hour produced, corresponding to 4,350 -4- 3-156 zz&apos; 1,378 B.Th.TJ., per lb. of coal gasified. This figure must be debited against the producer plant.A similar procedure has been adopted in dealing with the case of a gas-firing efficiency of 90 per cent., and it may be noted that the figures obtained in the above manner are in close agreement with data supplied by leading turbine makers. &apos;. The two thermal balance sheets indicate that there is a substantial gain in thermal economy when the steam is taken from the main turbines instead of being raised in low-pressure boilers, the more efficient use of the steam in the former case being responsible for a saving of about 45 per cent, of the thermal units needed for meeting the plant requirements by the latter method per unit weight of coal gasified. In order to maintain the full output of the power plant, i,e., to compensate for the steam abstracted from the turbines, the quantity of high-pressure steam supplied to the latter must be in excess of that normally required by about 20 and 16 per cent, respectively for gas-firing efficiencies of 75 and 90 per cent.In considering the further aspects of power pro-duction by the application of the gasification of coal, it will be assumed that the steam required for the recovery producers is derived from the main turbines.&apos; The thermal efficiencies quoted in the previous table will be taken at the round figures of 56 and 58 per cent, respectively.Application to Power Production.Upon the basis of the figures previously given the table on p. 182 shows the overall thermal efficiency of a complete power installation as compared with that of a direct coal-fired station, and also the total fuel consumption per kw.-year available. In this case the power gas is utilised at relative thermal efficiencies of 75 4- 80 = 0-9375 and 90 -s- 80 s 1-125, and these figures when taken in conjunction with the cor-i responding.efficiencies of the recovery producer section igive fhe comparative overall values indicated in the table. 1   .

The installation comprises 14 producers, two being in reserve, with all accessories including reserve, and complete plant for the recovery of ammonium sulphate. The capital cost is thus equiva-lent to  0-79 per ton of coal gasified per annum.Another estimate supplied by the makers of a modified design of installation that has come into fairly extensive use abroad places the pre-war cost of a plant for gasifying 200 tons of coal per day at approxi-mately  38,200, inclusive of buildings and foundations but exclusive of the requisite steam-raising plant. The installation comprises 10 producers with all accessories and complete ammonium sulphate recovery plant, but no reserve producers or accessories. The capital cost in this case is equivalent to  0-52 per ton of coal gasified per annum.When account is taken of the best features of the two installations, it seems probable that the capital cost of a large-scale recovery producer plant with adequate interconnections, but exclusive of steam-raising plant and of reserve plant, would be about  0-6 per ton of coal gasified per annum, and this figure has been adopted. With an allowance foi reserve plant equivalent to 15 per cent, of the running plant, the capital cost becomes  0 - 69 per ton of coal per annum.Upon the basis of the figures for coal consumption in the previous table, and of the data given for the increased capacity of the power station boilers when the steam for the producer plant is taken from the main turbines, the capital cost of the producer section of a complete power station would be as follows : CAPITAL COST OF REOOYERY PRODUCER SECTION.Items.	  per kw. of Maximum Load with Gas-firing Efficiency of		75 per. cent,	90 per cent.Recovery producer plant.

For the complete gasification and power installation, the operating costs would therefore amount to  4-34 or  3-78 per full kw.-year according to the efficiency of gas firing.Revenue from By-Products.The tar obtained in the operation of recovery pro-ducers is not of a high quality, and the nett revenue obtained from its sale under pre-war conditions varied from 108. to 15s. per ton, an average figure being 12s. 6d!. per ton, which has been adopted. The value of the ammonium sulphate is dealt with below as in previous schemes.

Possible Cost of Electrical Energy.The financial possibilities of power production on a large scale by the. gasification of coal under ammonia recovery conditions are indicated below in a balance sheet and upon a chart (Chart 6).   The table is basedupon a coal price of 10s. per ton and a nett revenue of  10 per ton from ammonium sulphate. The chart shows the effect of variations in the price of coal and in the nett revenue from sulphate, and also the corresponding costs of electrical energy by direct coal-firing with coal at different prices.COST OP ENERGY via GASIFICATION OP COAL IN recovery PRODUCERS.Items.  per full Kvv,-year, with Gas-firing Efficiency of75 per cent.90 per cent.Debit :Working expenses: Of producer and power plants, including capital charges.

An increase of Is, per ton in the price of coal affects the system to the extent of from 10s. to 12-3s. per kw.-year according to the efficiency of gas-firing, as compared with 6- 5s. per kw.-year in the case of direct firing. A variation in the market price of ammonium sulphate to the extent of  1 per ton of sulphate modifies the nett revenue, and hence the nett cost of electrical energy, by from 8- 4s. to 10 -4s. per kw.-year according to the efficiency of gas-firing.With ammonium sulphate at the nett values of  6,  8,  10, and  12 per ton and tar at the nett value pre-viou;ly taken, the maximum prices of coal at which a gasification scheme could compete on an equality with direct firing (with coal at the same price) are shown in the table opposite : LIMITING PRICES OF COAL.Nett Revenue per ton of Sulphate.	.

With coal at, say, 7s. 6eZ. per ton, the position would be much more favourable. In the case of a nett revenue of  10 per ton for ammonium sulphate and with gas-firing efficiencies of 75 and 90 per cent, respectively, the nett cost of electrical energy via gasification would amount to  3-35 and  2&apos; 98 per kw.-year, representing a saving of about 14 and 23 per cent, on the cost by direct firing with coal at 7s. Qd. per ton. If coal suitable for recovery producers were available for 7s. 6d. per ton while 10s. per ton had to be paid for boiler coal, the gasification system, with a nett revenue of  10 per ton for ammonium sulphate, would show a saving of about 28 and 36 per cent, upon the cost by direct firing.i The financial aspects of the application of the gasification of coal to power production on a large scale are clearly seen to be essentially dependent upon the availability of cheap coal and a fair nett return from the sale of ammonium sulphate. The possibilities of the system would be materially improved by the successful development of high-efficiency gas-fired boilers suitable for use in large power stations. From the point of view of the conservation of nitrogen, the system has an outstanding advantage over any existing method of treating fuel, since as much as 70 per cent, of the nitrogen content of the coal employed is recoverable as ammonia or ammonium sulphate.The capital outlay for the system is somewhat heavy, amounting to from  17*45 to  19*2 per kw. of maximum load, according to the thermal efficiency of gas-firing, or an increase of from 70 to 87 per cent, on the cost of an equivalent direct-fired station.Reference is made in a subsequent section (Section VI.) to the possible effects of improvements in existing recovery producer practice.
SECTION IV.GASIFICATION OF COKE IN RECOVERYPRODUCERS.The application of coal carbonisation alone to power production involves the combustion of the resulting coke under the power station boilers, and hence the total loss of the combined nitrogen remaining in the coke. The process of gasifying coke under ammonia recovery conditions has not hitherto been resorted to on any extensive scale, but a certain amount of infor-mation based upon established practice and large-scale trial operations in this country is available on the subject. The possibilities attaching to the use of the process as a stage in the production of power will therefore be considered.Nitrogen Content of Coke.The percentage of nitrogen remaining in the coke derived from a coal of specified quality depends prin-cipally upon the temperature at which the coal has been carbonised and upon the duration of the period of carbonisation. The influence of the temperature of carbonisation upon the amount of nitrogen driven off in the form of ammonia, and that remaining in the coke is indicated in the following table (Goal and its Scientific Uses, Bone, 1918), which deals, however, with the results of small-scale experiments. These were carried out with a Silesian coal containing 1139 per cent, of nitrogen and 6-63 per cent, of ash.EPEECTS OF CARBONISATION.Small-scale experiments.Temper ATuiiE op Cakbonisa-tion.

From the above tables it appears that when coal is carbonised (a) at low temperatures, up to 600o C, (b) under modem gasworks conditions, and (c) under modern recovery coke-oven conditions, the percentage of the original nitrogen content of the coal still remaining in the coke is, in round figures, of the order of (a) 70 per cent., (6) 60 per cent., and (c) 45 per cent, respectively.If the figures previously adopted for the average yield or estimated yield of coke by the different systems of carbonisation are taken in conjunction with the above values, the percentage of nitrogen that might be expected in a unit weight of the different types of coke obtainable from a coal originally containing 1 - 3 per cent, of nitrogen would be as follows: POSSIBLE NITROGEN CONTENT OF VARIOUS COKES.Class of Coke.

In the case of low temperature coke, the in-vestigations hitherto made appear to show that the nitrogen content is approximately equal to or somewhat higher than that of the original coal.Yield of Products.The coke resulting from the carbonisation of a coal contains the whole of the ash originally present in the coal, but only a proportion of the original volatile, the latter depending upon the system of carbonisation adopted. The volatile is highest in the case of low temperature coke, amounting to perhaps 10 per cent. On account of the absence of tarry products in coke,
the only by-product obtained by converting it into power gas in recovery producers is ammonia or ammonium sulphate.The figures available for the yield of ammonium sulphate show considerable divergence even for a definite class of coke. In the case of high temperature coke containing 1 to 1-1 per cent, of nitrogen, the results of large-scale trials show that the proportion recovered in the form of ammonium sulphate has varied between the wide limits of 20 and 60 per cent. It is stated, however, on- good authority, that about 50 per cent, of the nitrogen should be recovered, representing a yield of about 50 lb. of ammonium sulphate (25 per cent. NH3) per ton of coke gasified, and that this figure has been established in coke fuel recovery practice in this country. According to the same authority, the recovery should be considerably better when using low temperature coke which con-tains the bulk of the nitrogen present in the original coal, The results of large-scale trials have shown that from 65 to 70 per cent, of the nitrogen can be obtained as ammonium sulphate.It has been observed in the course of comparative trials that the nitrogen present in low temperature coke is more amenable to recovery as ammonia than that in coke produced by carbonisation at a high temperature. In this connection it may be noted that various investigators have come to the conclusion on other grounds that the combined nitrogen in coal is present in at least two distinct forms, one of which is of a very stable character and does not yield ammonia under the influence of heat. The presence of such a form of nitrogen to a relatively larger extent in high temperature coke than in low temperature coke would accord with the results observed during the gasificationof these varieties. It is also of interest to recall the fact that the maximum yield of ammonia nitrogen hitherto obtained in the gasification of coal represents the equivalent of some 70 per cent, of the total nitrogen content of the coal.The results already obtained by gasifying high temperature coke under ammonia recovery conditions show that a ton of coke will yield from 125,000 to 1.27,000 cubic feet of power gas having a nett calorific value cf from 105 to 125 B.Th.U. per cubic foot according to the conditions of operation. It is con-sidered on good authority that, under proper working conditions, 125,000 cubic feet of gas having a nett - calorific value of 120 B.Th.U. per cubic foot should be obtainable on an average per ton of coke gasified.In the case of low temperature coke, the results hitherto secured have shown a Avider variation, the yield of gas per ton of coke having ranged from 124,000 to 145,000 cubic feet, and the nett calorific value from 125 to 145 B,Th.U, per cubic foot. This is probably due to differences in the amount of volatile, moisture, and ash in the various cokes gasified, the latter having been obtained from different coals. From a careful examination of the evidence available and in the light of the opinions expressed by experienced authorities conversant with the investigations hitherto made, it appears probable that an average yield of 140,000 cubic feet of gas having a nett calorific value of 130 B.Th.U. per cubic foot could be expected from the gasification of low temperature coke under ammonia recovery conditions.Starting from a coal of the character previously specified, the information just summarised points to the following conclusions as to the yield of products obtainable by gasifying coke in recovery producers: YIELD.

Thermal Considerations.A portion of the gross yield of power gas has to be utilised for raising steam for the recovery producer in-stallation, and the information available indicates that the nett amount of steam to be raised for the producer blast when gasifying coke is approximately the same aswhen gasifying coal, per unit weight of material treated. The steam requirements of the sulphate evaporating plant will vary pro rata with the amount of sulphate recovered per ton of coke, but the minor differences thus introduced are neglected in the figures given below.THERMAL BALANCE SHEET FOR GASIFICATION OF COKE IN RECOYERYPRODUCERS.Class of Coke and Calorific Value per lb. as fired.

In dealing with the gasification of coal under ammonia recovery conditions, it was shown that the plant requirements amounted to 1&apos;63 lb. of steam per lb. of coal gasified. If the steam is taken from a low pressure stage of the main turbines of the power installation, a calculation on the lines indicated when dealing with the gasification of coal shows that the excess requirements of the ma!u boiler plant to com-compensate for the abstracted steam .mount approximately to 1,378 B.Th.U. and 1,151 B.Th.U. per lb. of coke gasified, for boiler efficiencies of 75 and 90 per cent, respectively. Moreover, the corresponding increases in the capacity of the boiler plant amount to 26 and 21 per cent, for high temperature coke, and to 20 and 16 per cent, for low temperature coke.If these figures are taken in conjunction with those for the yield of power, gas, the thermal economy of coke gasification would be as indicated in the table at the bottom of the previous page.The corresponding thermal efficiencies in the case of coal gasification were 5613 and 58 -&apos;2 per cent.Application to Power Production.Dealing next with tho use of the surplus gas in the power station with boiler efficiencies of 75 and 90 per cent, respectively, the following table shows the overall thermal efficiency of a complete power installation with a section, for gasifying coke under recovery con-ditions, as compared with an equivalent coal-fired station, and also the total consumption of coke per kw.-year of 8,760 hours: POWER PRODUCTION via GASIFICATION OF COKE.Class of Coke and Calorific Value per lb. as fired.Thermal Efficiency of Power StationBoilers.Percentage of Gross Yield of Power Gas from Coke available for Power Purposes after meeting requirements of Producers.  . *Comparative Overall Thermal Efficiency of Producer and power Plant (Coal-fired station = 100).High temperature coke (11,000 B.Th.U, nett, per lb.).Low temperature coke (11,500 B.Th.U, nett, per lb.).Per cent. 75 9075 90Per cent. 79-4 &apos; 82-883-0 85-8Per cent. 45-3 56-755-0 68-2Total Consumption of Coke (calorific value as specified) per kw.-year of 8,760 hours (Direct-fired station = 6-5 tons of coal of 12,000 B.Th.U. per lb.)&quot;Tons. 15-6 12-512-3 9-9As the whole of the fuel available for power purposes is in the gaseous form, there would be a substantial reduction in the total consumption of coke by the employment of gas-fired boilers having a thermal efficiency of 90 instead of 75 per cent.The salient point revealed by the above table is that the application of the gasification of coke to power production on a large scale would, upon the basis of the evidence available, involve the consumption of from 1 - 5 to 2 - 4 tons of coke for every ton of coal required in an equivalent direct-fired station.H supplies of coke were obtained from independent carbonising works, the quantities of coal consumed at these works in providing the requirements of the power installation, taking the higher sets of figures given in the preceding table, would be as follows: COAL TO BE CARBONISED FOR SUPPLYING NECESSARY COKE.Class of Coke.

As previously shown, the capital cost of the steam-raising plant when the steam for the producers is derived from the main turbines, is equiva-lent in the case of high-temperature coke to about 26 and 21 per cent, of the cost of the main high-pressure boiler plant for gas-firing efficiencies of 75 and 90 per cent, respectively, and to about 20 and 16 per cent, in the case of low-temperature coke, vThe operating costs, inclusive of steam-raising, but exclusive of capital charges, have been taken at 3s. 3d. per ton of coke gasified.If these figures are applied to the data given in the preceding tables, the following results are indicated, allowance being made as before for reserve gasification plant equivalent to 15 per Cent, of the l-unning plant:

Moreover, an alteration in the nett revenue to the extent of  1 per ton of sulphate would affect the cost of electrical energy to the extent of from 6s. to 10s. per kw.-year.Taking nett revenues of  8,  10, and  12 per ton for ammonium sulphate, the table opposite shows the maximum prices at which coke would have to be procurable in order to enable the gasification system to compete upon an equality with direct firing with coal at the same price.Prices of the order of 10s. to 12s. per ton for gas-works coke and of 17s. 6d. to 18s. 6d. for metallurgical coke have been recorded in the past, and it is unlikely that these products will be obtainable at lower prices in the future. It is clear, therefore, that a system involving the gasification of high temperature coke and depending upon limiting prices as low as those given in the table opposite, cannot -be regarded as a potential competitor of direct firing for the generation of cheap electrical energy.The position in regard to the gasification of low temperature coke cannot be said to disclose any great promise. As this class of coke has advantages over gasworks coke as a domestic fuel, it might be expected to command a better price than the latter. Even if the coke were obtainable for 15s. per ton, the gasifica-tion system operating at a gas-firing efficiency of 90 per cent, would only be on a financial equality with direct firing (with coal at the same price) in the event of the market price of ammonium sulphate providing for a nett return of  12 per ton of sulphate.LIMITING PRICES OF COKE.Class ol Coke and Nett Revenue per ton of Sulphate.

SECTION Y.COMBINATION PROCESSES.LOW TEMPERATURE CARBONISATION FOLLOWED BY GASIFICATION OF THE RESULTING COKE IN RECOVERY PRODUCERS.It lias been shown that the application of low temperature carbonisation to power production on a large scale foreshadows the possibility of economies in the cost of generation providing, of course, that the estimated and tentative figures which have been utilised are eventually substantiated in commercial practice.On the other hand, the general trend of the evidence available points to the conclusion that power schemes depending solely upon the gasification of low tempera-ture coke in recovery producers offer little or no prospect of competing with systems depending upon direct firing.The question arises as to the possibilities of a com-bination scheme involving the carbonisation of coal at a low temperature as a first stage, and the complete gasification of the resulting coke under ammonia recovery conditions as a second stage, the surplus gas from each stage being utilised for raising steam in the power plant and the revenue from the sale of the whole of the by-products from the two stages being off-set against the overall working costs.   This aspect of power production with by-product recovery is dealt with below in the light of the claims made for low tempera -ture carbonisation and of the evidence available upon the subject of the gasification of coke under ammonia recovery conditions.It has been deemed unnecessary to deal with the possibilities of high temperature carbonisation on similar lines, since in this case each of the stages of the combination scheme, per se, is at a disadvantage from the standpoint of the cost of electrical energy as compared with the results foreshadowed on the basis of the claims made for low temperature carbonisation.Yield of Products.The figures set out below have been obtained by amalgamating the data. previously given for the separate stages of the scheme.Dealing in the first place with the gasification stage, the probable yield of products on the basis of a ton of coal carbonised, would be as follows: PROBABLE YIELD IN GASIFICATION STAGE PER TON OF COAL.System of Low Temperature Carbonisation and percentage yield of Coke and Breeze per ton of Coal.

The figures for the average calorific value of the mixed gas yielded in the two stages are obtained by dividing the total thermal value of the mixed gases by the total volume produced.PROBABLE TOTAL YIELD OF SULPHATE AND POWER GAS.System of Low Temperature Carbonisation and Stage of Process.

The yields of gas are gross figures and are subject to deductions for the requirements of the carbonising and recovery producer plants as indicated later,Talcing account of the other products from the carbonising stage, the estimated overall yields per ton of coal utilised are as summarised in the table below : YIELD OF PRODUCTS PER TON OP COAL.

rApplication to Power Production.Dealing next with the utilisation of the surplus power gas, the table set out below gives the overall thermal efficiency of the complete power installation ascompared with that of a direct coal-fired station, and also the total fuel consumption per kw.-year available, The figures for the comparative thermal efficiency of the power scheme are obtained in the manner indicated in previous cases.POWER PRODUCTION via COMBINATION PROCESS.System Applied, and Thermal Efficiency of Main Gas-fired Boilers taken at:	Percentage of Gross Yield of Gas from both Stages available for Power Purposes, after meeting Requirements of Carbonising and Producer Plants.

In the combined schemes dealt with in the following table the increased capacity of the main boiler plant needed for meeting the steam requirements of the recovery producer section has been taken approximately pro rata on the basis of the quantity of coke to be gasified in the second stage of the process.\CAPITAL   OUTLAY   FOR  POWER  INSTALLATION   COMPRISING   LOW   TEMPERATURE CARBONISING PLANT AND recovery PRODUCERS FOR GASIFYING THE COKE.Scale -. 100,000 kw. maximum demand.Since the whole of the surplus fuel available for power purposes is in the gaseous form, there would be a substantial economy in the overall fuel requirements if gas-fired boilers having a thermal efficiency of 90 per cent, instead of 75 per cent, were employed, as shown above.The salient point revealed by the above table is that the application of a combined carbonisation and gasification scheme to power production on a large scale would, upon the basis of the tentative figures available, involve the consumption of from 80 to 150 per cent, more coal than an equivalent direct-fired station.Capital Cost.From the figures given in previous sections, the approximate capital outlay for a complete installationDetails.Via System A.Thermal Efficiency of Gas-firing :Via System B.Thermal Efficiency of Gas-firing :75 per cent.90 per cent.75 per cent.90 per cent.Total fuel to be treated per kw,-year of 8,760 hours-Coal to be carbonised Coke, resulting, to be gasified.Tons.16-2 12-1Tons.13-0 9-7Tons.14-3 10-0Tons.11-78-2Capital Cost.

The corresponding costs of electrical energy by direct coal-firing with coal at different prices are also indicated on the charts.The estimated cost in the case of an equivalent direct-fired station with coal at 10s. per ton amounts to  4 - 7 per full kw.-year.From an examination of the figures given in the table on the next page it will be observed that an increase of Is. per ton in the price of coal affects the combination process to the extent of from 11-7s. to 16-2s. per kw.-year, according to the system of carbonisation and the thermal efficiency of gas-firing, as compared with 6-5s. per kw.-year in the case of direct firing. Moreover, a variation in the market price of ammonium sulphate to the extent of  1 per ton of sulphate modifies the nett revenue, and hence U 6619the nett cost of electrical energy, by from 9-6s. to 12s. per kw.-year.With ammonium sulphate at the nett values of  6,  8,  10, and  12 per ton and other by-products at the nett values specified above, the maximum prices of coal at which the combination process could compete on an equality with direct firing (with coal at the same price) are as indicated in the following table: LIMITING PRICES OF COAL.Nett Revenue per ton of Sulphate.

The limiting prices for System B are much more favourable, and the combination process in this case foreshadows the possibility of obtaining electrical energy at a cost materially lower than that by direct firing. It still remains to be substantiated, however, that the yields claimed for System B and the esti-mated costs of operation can be realised under average commercial conditions.It is also seen from Chart 8 that the possibilities of the combination process would be considerably im-proved by the successful development of high-efficiencygas-fired boilers suitable for use in large power stations.From the point of view of the conservation of nitrogen, the process compares favourably with the best of those previously dealt with, the evidence avail-able pointing to the conclusion that from 58 to 65 per cent, of the total nitrogen content of the coal can be recovered as compared with about 70 per cent, when coal is gasified in a single stage in recovery producers.The estimated capital outlay for a complete power installation involving the employment of the combina-tion process is much larger than that for any of the other schemes, amounting to from  25 - 4 to  31 - 8 per kw. of maximum load according to the efficiency of gas-firing, i.e., from 2-5 to 3-l times the cost of an equivalent direct-fired power station.N tTaking 10s. per ton as a possible price for coal of specified above, the position of the combination process the character needed, and nett revenues and yields as   would be as follows: APPLICATION TO POWER PRODUCTION OP LOW TEMPERATURE CARBONISATION FOLLOWED BY GASIFICATION OF COKE IN recovery PRODUCERS.
SECTION TI.DIRECT FIRING AND RECOVERY PROCESSESCOMPARED.Li previous sections various by-product power schemes have been contrasted with direct coal-firing. It now remains to, compare the schemes one with another, and also to summarise the outstanding factors governing the general financial aspects of power pro-duction on a large scale with by-product recovery. The figures given below are based upon a thermal efficiency of 75 per cent, for gas-firing, but reference is subsequently made to the modifications that would result if an efficiency of 90 per cent, could be realised.Conii umption and Limiting Prices of Coal.On account of the thermal requirements of the different processes for treating fuel&quot; for the recovery of by-products and of the losses which occur during such treatment, more coal per kw.-year is required for any power scheme involving by-product recovery than is needed by direct firing. In the case of some pro-cesses the increase in the quantity of coal consumed is quite considerable, as indicated by the figures given below which include a full allowance for the thermal losses and plant requirements at each stage.It does not necessarily follow that the power schemes involving the largest consumption of coalcompare least favourably with direct firing, seeing that they offer the prospect of the largest yield of by-pro-ducts as an offset against the cost of the coal. Broadly, it will be found that the schemes which are least efficient from the thermal point of view offer the pros-pects of cheaper electrical energy than .the more efficient schemes on account of the larger yield of. by-products.The price at which coal is available is a vital factor in any power scheme involving by-product recovery. As a given variation in the price causes a greater rise or fall in the total cost of coal per kw.-year than in the case of direct firing, it follows that whatever may be the value of the by-products recovered per ton of coal used, there is a limiting price of coal beyond which direct firing is the cheaper for the production of power., j The greater the value of the by-products, however, the higher is the limiting price of coal for any given scheme as is clearly shown on the charts previously given.Taking the nett revenue from the sale of ammonium sulphate at  10 per ton of sulphate, and the nett values of other by-products such as tar, benzol, and light spirit at the figures previously given, the limiting prices of coal for the various power schemes are as indicated in the following table.COAL CONSUMPTION AND LIMITING PRICES OP COAL.Coal Consumed and Limiting Price. -	-Direct Firing.

In the case of some schemes, for example the application of high temperature carbonisation to power production, the limiting prices of coal are so low, that there is no pros-pect of their i-ealisa.tion. There has been a continuous upward trend in the price of coal over a period of years,and this is almost certain to persist in the future. To some extent the price of by-products may tend to rise with the price of coal, but no great reliance can be placed upon this eventuality.Conservation of By-Products.From the point of view of the conservation of the potential by-products from coal, there is no question that the best results are shown by power schemes
involving the total conversion of the fuel into power gas. When the coal is gasified in a single stage under the well-known conditions for ammonia recovery, the products obtained consist of tar of a poor quality and ammonium sulphate equivalent to as much as 70 per cent, of the nitrogen content of the coal employed. If the treatment is carried out in two stages, however, the coal being first carbonised at a low temperature and the resulting coke then being gasified in recovery pro-ducers, the position as regards the total recovery of by-products appears to be even more favourable in spite of a somewhat smaller yield of ammonium sulphate.Upon the basis of the claims made for low temperature carbonisation and of the evidence available on the sub-ject of the gasification of low temperature coke in recovery producers, the products obtainable would consist of tar of a good quality, benzol or light spirit from the stripping of the gas yielded in the carbonising stage, and ammonium sulphate equivalent to from 58 to 65 per cent, of the nitrogen content of the coal employed.The quantities of by-products recoverable per ton of coal utilised and also per full kw.-year by the systems previously dealt with are indicated in the table below.YIELD OF BY-PRODUCTS AND NETT REVENUE THEREFROM.By-Products and Basis of Yield.

There is more uncertainty, however, in the case of ammonium sulphate, which has exhibited considerable fluctuations in price during the last ten years and will be called upon to face the increasing competition of synthetic nitrogen products in the near future. Industries such as those engaged in the manufacture of coal gas or metallurgical coke can face this competition because an increased charge can be made for gas, coke, and subsidiary products to com-compensate for a fall in the price of ammonium sulphate. No such expedient is open to a by-product power in-stallation competing with a direct-fired station, because the revenue from the sale of ammonium sulphate is an essential item of any margin that may exist in thenett cost of electrical energy as between the two stations. The same observations also apply in the case of the other products, such as tar and benzol.The extent to which the revenue from the sale of by-products is relied upon in the different power schemes to offset the increased working expenses and the cost of the increased quantity of coal required is indicated in the table given above, the figures being based upon anett revenue of  10 per ton for ammonium sulphate and upon the nett values previously specified in the case of other by-products.In the case of direct firing, the principal variable is the price of coal, which may be expected to increase in the future.as it has done over a period of years in the immediate past. In all by-product power schemes, there are additional variables, namely, the future prices of the by-products; moreover, the schemes which give the highest yield of by-products also involve the largest consumption of coal. It is clear, therefore, that the financial stability of such schemes over a short period of years is open to much greater uncertainty than that of direct firing. The position in this respect would be more favourable for a scheme which yielded a smaller return of by-products from a
lesser quantity of coal per kw.-year, and at the same time was characterised by a&apos; reasonably high limiting price of coal. This combination of features is indicated in the case of one system of low temperature carbonisation -tion, but the claims made for this process still remain to be substantiated in commercial working.A rise in the price of coal coupled with a fall in the value of the by-products would react adversely upon all the power schemes.Variations in the Quality of Coal.The quality of the coal, employed is an important factor in all by-product power schemes, and in order to enable a fair comparison to be made of the different schemes a definite quality was assumed in all cases. In the event of any departure from the specified quality, the figures for the different schemes will of course be modified, and it is necessary to indicate briefly the general character of the modifications thus introduced.In the first place, the nitrogen content of the coal has been taken at 1&apos; 3 per cent., whereas, in practice, variations from, say, 1-2 to 1- 4 per cent., or perhaps more are encountered. The effect of such variations would be small in the case of schemes involving carbonisation only, owing to the fact that the yield of ammonium sulphate only represents the equivalent of from 10 to 20 per cent, of the total nitrogen content of the coal. On the other hand, from 58 to 70 per cent, of the nitrogen content is recoverable as sulphate in schemes involving the complete gasification of coal, as previously indicated, and a variation of 0-1 per -cent, in the nitrogen content of the coal would affect the yield to the extent of from 6*3 lb. to 7-6 lb. of sulphate (25 per cent. NETd per ton of coal,, and the nett revenue per kw.-year from the sale of ammonium sulphate to the extent of from 7*5 to 8 per cent., according to the scheme.In the next place, the volatile content reckoned on the dry coal has been taken at a minimum of 30 per cent., and any departure from this figure would have an effect upon the yield of gas, coke, and other products obtainable by the various methods of treating fuel.Finally the ash content reckoned on the dry coal has been taken at a maximum of 10 per cent., and an increase upon this figure would affect the yield of products as well as the calorific value of the coal and of coke produced from it. If the percentage of ash could not be reduced below, say 20 per cent., it might still be possible to utilise the coal to advantage either by carbonisation at a low temperature or by gasifica-tion under ammonia recovery conditions, providing that the volatile were still as high as 30 per cent, and the nitrogen content also remained high. With such a coal, however, the capacity of the plant and hence its capital cost might have to be increased, and further operating costs would be incurred on account of the additional raw coal and ash to be handled. If washing were resorted to for the purpose of reducing the ash content of an otherwise suitable coal, further charges would be incurred in this connection.Capital Costs.In dealing with the capital outlay for a power installation with a by-product recovery section, no attempt has been made to introduce adjustments such as would be occasioned by the partial or total substi-tution of gas-firing for coal-firing in the power station. These adjustments would principally affect the outlay for coal and ash conveying plant, for mechanical stokers and the like, and would differ according to the by-product scheme adopted. As will be seen from the itemised estimate of the capital outlay for a direct-fired station given in the Report, the adjustments would not lead to any substantial modification in the figures summarised below.CAPITAL OUTLAY FOR POWER INSTALLATIONS WITH BY-PRODUCT SECTIONS.Scale : 100,000 lew. maximum demand.

The operating costs of all the by-product i, schemes have been taken as exclusive of the costs incurred in the recovery and working up of the by-products them-selves, the latter costs having been allowed for in the figures adopted for the nett revenues derivable from the sale of the by-products. No account has been taken of the modifications occasioned in the operating costs of the power section through the partial or total substitution of gas-firing for coal-firing, as these would not materially affect the figures which are summarised in the first table given on the next page.As in the case of capital costs, the working expenses for a power scheme aiming at the maximum recovery of all by-products are substantially larger than those for any other scheme.Nett Cost of Electrical Energy.A general indication of the relation of direct firing to by-product schemes from the point of view of the nett cost of electrical energy is afforded by the second table given on the next page. It is assumed that coal of the specified quality could be purchased for 10s. per ton delivered, that a nett revenue of  10 per ton could be obtained from the sale of ammonium sulphate, and that the other by-products would furnish nett revenues of the values previously taken.

&quot;With coal and by-products at the price and values adopted, the nett cost of electrical energy by each of the three well-established methods of treating coal for by-product recovery is higher than the cost by direct firing by amounts varying from 4 to 29 per cent. The only power schemes which foreshadow a saving in the cost of gener-ation are those involving low tempera-ture carbonisation, which has yet to be proved on a full commercial scale both in regard to the yield of by-products and the costs of operation. In this con-nection it is significant to observe the remarkable variations that are possible upon the basis of the claims made for the two distinct methods- of low temperature carbonisation under review. As compared with the cost by direct firing, the adoption of one method might lead to a saving of 1&apos;5 per cent., or a loss of 7 per cent,, whereas the second method fore-shadows a saving of from 29 to 40 per cent, according to the character of the complete power scheme. The lower figures indicate that the low temperature process if applied to power production might perhaps be operated at a cost on a parity with that of direct firing, whereas the upper figures would provide a substantial margin for meeting fluctuations in the price of coal and the value of the by-products. It is possible that the figures eventually realised might be of an inter-mediate order, but it is clearly premature in the present state of knowledge to attempt to draw any definite conclusions as to the future prospects of the low tem-temperature process as a stage in the production of power on a large scale.If coal of a suitable quality were available at a lower price than 10s. per ton, there would be an improvement in the position of all the by-product schemes. For example, with coal at 7s. Qd. per ton delivered, and with by-products at the values ta.ken in the last table, the nett cost of electrical energy by the application of recovery producer practice to power production would amount to  3&apos;35 per full kw.-year, or a saving of nearly 14 per cent on the cost by direct firing with coal at the same price, namely  3 - 89 per full kw.-year.Efficiency of Gas-firing.In all of the above figures, the thermal efficiency of the power station boilers when fired with gas has &quot;been taken at 75 per cent., but in dealing with the various by-product schemes in detail, alternative figures were given in order to indicate the effect of an efficiency of 90 per cent. It was shown that gas-firing played a relatively small part in some of the by-product power schemes, and that there was no material gain to be anticipated by an increase in the efficiency of gas-firing.On the other hand, the higher efficiency would have an important effect upon schemes in which the fuel is entirely converted into power gas, either in one or two stages, and would lead to a marked saving in capital expenditure, in operating costs and in the consumption of coal. On account, however, of the consequent re-duction in the yield of by-products, the higher efficiency would not necessarily lead to a lower nett cost of electrical energy when the price of coal was low, but it would always lead to a lower nett cost when the price of coal was high. It follows, there-fore, that the limiting price of coal at which such schemes could be profitably operated in competition with direct firing becomes higher as the efficiency of gas-firing rises. The power schemes would thus become less sensitive to variations in the price of coal with by-products at a definite value, or vice versa, and their commercial stability would accordingly be improved. These important facts are clearly shown Jjy an examination of the chart? previously given.Taking, as an example, the application of recovery producer practice to power production, it has already been shown that with coal at 10s. per ton and specified values for the by-products, the nett cost of electrical energy with the efficiency of gas-firing ^taken at 75 per cent, would amount to  4-89 per full kw.-year. By the mere increase of the efficiency to 90 per cent-the nett cost would become  4- 22 per full kw.-year, a reduction of over 13 per cent. In the former case the power scheme would operate at a loss of 4 per cent, as compared with the corresponding cost by direct firing,whereas the higher efficiency would convert this loss into an advantage of about 10 per cent.Load Factor.The arc and calcium cyanamide processes for fixing atmospheric nitrogen require to be operated upon a large scale and at a high annual load factor in order to ensure the maximum economy.&apos; Since the load factor of these processes may approximate to 100 per cent., the problem of determining the probable cost of generating electricity in bulk from coal for nitrogen fixation purposes has been greatly simplified. The above conditions as to scale and load factor also apply in the case of other electro-chemical processes, but the position is different for a large power station supplying ordinary industrial consumers. In this case an annual load factor of 50 per cent., or perhaps 60 per cent., will generally not be exceeded, and the question of the cost of generation is not so straightforward, especially in the case of by-product power schemes.A diminution in the annual load factor results, broadly, in a decrease in the annual consumption of coal, but the decrease is not a proportionate one, on account of the stand-by losses and of the less efficient character of the plant when not operating at full load. . The cost of coal per unit output therefore rises, and as the fixed charges are also distributed over a smaller total output, the effect of a smaller load factor is to increase the cost per unit or per full kw.-year. &quot;While there exist ample data from which it is possible to determine the effect of a variable load upon the cost of generation at a direct-fired steam turbo-electric station, the- position is less clear when by-product recovery processes are applied to power production. Nevertheless, certain general conclusions can be drawn from a consideration of the characteristics of the various processes for treating fuel for by-product recovery.It is obvious that carbonisation processes are not well adapted for operating under widely varying con-ditions of load unless provision is made for the storage of gas upon a scale sufficient to meet any demand in excess of the normal working capacity of the carbonising plant. For a power station having a nominal maximum demand of 100,000 kw., the storage capacity would assume excessive proportions, as indicated by the figures given in a subsequent table, and the additional capital expenditure for gas-holders woidd probably have a serious effect upon the general financial economy of the power scheme. It may therefore be assumed that any carbonisation process which fore-shadowed a reduction in the cost of electrical energy would have to be operated continuously at approxi-mately the full rated capacity of the carbonising plant in order to secure the results anticipated. &apos; A gasification process stands on a different footing, as a recovery producer is capable of responding prac-tically instantaneously to an increase or diminution in the load, on account of the readiness with which the output of gas can be regulated by controlling the blast. If fed with suitable coal, a producer can carry loads up to 50 per cent, in excess of the normal load for quite a considerable period without much detriment to the yield of ammonia or the quality of the producer gas. Moreover, the ammonia recovery plant, if arranged to stand increased pressures, can absorb about double the normal yield with an increase of not more than 5 per cent, in the loss of ammonia. A producer will also operate down to half load and still give a good yield of ammonia and gas of a good quality, providing it is maintained in uniform working at the reduced load. For these reasons it would be unneces-sary to provide storage for gas, even if considerable variations in load had to be met. As compared with steam-turbo plant, recovery producers possess the further advantage that the stand-by losses for idle pro-ducers are less than those for banked boilers, and this advantage is more pronounced as the load factor dimi-nishes. In a particular instance it was found that with a load factor of 25 per cent., the stand-by losses for the two types of plant were in the ratio of 1 to 4. Nevertheless, it must be noted that the &quot;up and down &quot; working of a producer is detrimental both to the yield of ammonia and to the quality of the gas, and in the event of a variable industrial demand having to be met, it might
be found that these disadvantages outweighed the advantages previously mentioned.The above considerations point to the conclusion that if by-product recovery processes were applied at large power stations having an annual load factor considerably below 100 per cent., it would be advan-tageous to instal only sufficient carbonisation or gasification plant to deal with the steady portion of the load, to operate such plant continuously at its maximum capacity to ensure the most economical use of the large capital outlay involved, and to rely upon auxiliary means for coping with the variable portion of the load. For example, a carbonisation or gasification plant might be used in conjunction with steam-turbo plant fired with coal, coke, or even with gas from stand-by producers. In the case of a combination process involving the carbonisation of coal followed by the gasification of the resulting coke, the variable portion of the load might be met by the recovery producers and coal could be gasified as a stand-by to deal with peak loads, or sufficient coke might be made and stored for the purpose. The precise combination offering the best financial results in a given case could only be determined from a knowledge of the average load factor and also of the general nature of the load curve. Each case of variable load would thus have to be considered on its merits.Although the broad results indicated in the case of plants operating at full load are not capable of application in detail to power schemes involving reduced load factors, they can be taken as giving an approximate idea of the comparative results that might be expected.Magnitude of By-Product Power Installations.An indication of the magnitude of the con-structional work involved in adapting by-product recovery processes to power production upon a large scale is afforded by a consideration of the quantities of coal and of secondary fuel products, such as coke and power gas, that would have to be handled or otherwise dealt with.The following table indicates the quantities of coal that would be utilised per day and per annum at a power station having a maximum load of 100,000 kw. and an annual load factor of 100 per cent., and the corresponding gross yields of secondary fuel products that would be consumed in meeting the requirements of the power plant and the by-product section of the installation. The figures are based upon a thermal efficiency of 75 per cent, for gas-firing and are exclusive of any provision for reserve fuel products.QUANTITIES OF COAL AND SECONDARY FUEL PRODUCTS TO BE HANDLED.Scale : 100,000 Inc. maximum demand; Load factor : 100 per cent.

The second largest individual gasworks in the world, the East Greenwich works of the South Metro-politan Gas Co.. can produce about 25,000,000 cu. ft. of coal gas per day, and consumes about 2,000 tons Of coal per day during the period of maximum demand. Lastly, the largest recovery producer installation in the world, the Parkhead installation of Messrs. Beard-more &amp; Co., has a rated gasification capacity of 720 tons of coal per day, corresponding to an output, at full load, of about 97,000,000 cu. ft. of gas per day.In the light of the above figures, it is clear that novel problems would arise in the design and lay-out of the gas mains and control arrangements for a power installation at which a daily production of from 400 to 500 million cubic feet of gas had to be collected, cooled, cleaned and distributed within the compass of the station site for meeting the requirements of the by-product and boiler sections of the power installation.Improvements in Existing Practice.Constant efforts are being made to improve the thermal and financial economy of established car-bonisation and gasification processes, and any marked advance in these directions might lead to a substantial modification in some of the figures previously given.In the case of gasworks practice, for example, notable results have been obtained by the. admission of steam to the carbonised charge in vertical retorts, the make of gas per ton of coal being increased from about 12,000 cu. ft. to about 15,000 or 16,000 cu. ft. without a proportionate drop in its calorific value and without any substantial variation in the yield of coke. Moreover, the yield of ammonia is also increased, and the Committee learns on good authority that as much as 50 lb. of ammonium sulphate has been recovered per ton of coal. Detailed information upon the thermal aspects of the steaming process is not available; but it must be noted that the additional plant requirements for steam-raising and for working up the increased yield of ammonia liquor have to be off-set against the increased make of gas. If the process proves to be more efficient thermally than ordinary gasworks practice, its adaptation to power production would
result in a diminution in the consumption of coal per kw.-year. In the absence of specific data, however, the general financial effect is difficult to estimate because account has to be taken of the extra capital and operating costs of the steam-raising plant and of the influence of the diminished consumption of coal upon the total yield of by-products per kw.-year. From the figures previously given it can be shown that with coal at 10s. per ton and with nett revenues up to  11 per toa for ammonium sulphate, an increase in the yield of sulphate from 25 lb. to 50 lb. per ton of coal if unaccompanied by an improvement in the thermal economy would still fail to place the steaming process upon an equality with direct firing.With resard to recovery producer plant, two points are worthy of brief consideration, namely, the steam requirements and the gasification capacity. Reference haB already been made to the large quantity of steam required in the air-blast, and to the fact that efforts have been made to reduce the nett steam requirements, and thus improve the thermal economy, by raising or regenerating more steam in the plant itself. This problem, however, is closely bound up with the question of the yield of ammonia, and it has been established in practice that the blast must be saturated at or about a temperature of 850 0. and superheated to a temperature of 180o to 230o 0. in order to obtain themaximum yield. When account is taken of the large quantity of steam needed for saturating air at the, above temperature, of the thermal requirements for superheating the blast, of the sensible heat in the gases issuing from the producer and of the heating surface of the producer walls, it cannot be said that there is a primd facie prospect of improving the thermal economy of producers designed on the con-conventional lines while maintaining at the same time the conditions necessary for the maximum recovery of ammonia.It is desirable, however, to indicate the general nature of the economies that would result if it were possible, without affecting the yield of ammonia, to reduce the nett requirements of the blast by, say, 50 per cent,, i.e., from 1*5 tons of steam to 0- 75 ton per ton of coal gasified. Upon the basis of the figures pre-viously given, the total amount of steam to be raised external to the producer plant for meeting the require-ments of the blast and of the sulphate evaporators would be reduced from 1 - 63 tons to 0 - 88 ton per ton of coal gasified. Under these conditions, the applica-tion of recovery producer practice to power production on a large scale would give the modified results sum-marised in the following table, assuming that the nett steam requirements were derived from a low-pressure stage of the turbines of the power plant.APPLICATION OF RECOVERY PRODUCER PRACTICE TO POWER PRODUCTION.Scale.- 100.000 lew. maximum demand.Comparative results when nett steam requirements for the blast and sulphate evaporators are taken at the alternative figures of 1163 tons and 0&apos;88 ton per ton of coal gasified, the steam being derived from the mainturbines of the power plant.&apos; - *&apos; -iThermal Results and Costs , with Gas-tiring efficiency of75 per cent. 90 per cent.Nett steam requirements per ton of coal taken at -	Tons. 1-63	Tons. 0-88	Tons. 1-63	Tons. 0-88i Thermal efficiency of producer installation   ....

It will thus be seeu that if the nett steam requirements of the blast could be reduced by 50 per cent, without affecting the yield of ammonia, there would be a diminution-tion in the coal consumption per kw.-year and in the capital and operating costs. Notwithstanding the smaller yield of by-products per kw.-year, the nett result would be a saving of from 5 to 6 per cent, in the cost of generation as compared with the normal opera-tion of the process.Dealing next with the gasification capacity, it must be noted that the largest recovery producers hitherto in operation in this country are capable of dealing with about 30 tons of coal per day. From the point of view of the requirements of a large power station, this unit is very small; and as many as 110 such producers (exclusive of spares) would be needed for maintaining in continuous operation a power station having a maximum load of 100,000 kw. The multiplication of units to this extent is an obvious handicap, not only from the standpoint of capital expenditure, but also on account of the cost of labour and superintendence, and. of the complexity of the lay-out as regards gas mains and interconnections.The problem of devising a satisfactory producer having a gasification capacity from two to three times greater than that of existing types is not a straight-forward one. In the first place, the zones of combustion in an ordinary recovery producer from the fire-grate upwards are fairly sharply defined, and lead to an optimum working depth df fuel bed which cannot be greatly exceeded if the best results are to be obtained.Experimental results in this country with a large trial producer about 30 feet in height have shown that a large increase in the depth of fuel is accompanied by substantial modifications in the conditions. If the dimensions of a producer were to be increased laterally instead of vertically, difficulties of poking and clinkering and of maintaining a uniform distribution of the blast over a large area of fuel would be encountered. It it probable that a high gasification capacity could only be obtained by resorting to mechanical appliances, such as revolving grates, or even to revolving producers which would enable hand poking to be dispensed with and ciinkering to be avoided, while at the same time auto-matically breaking up the fuel bed and thus maintaining a uniform resistance to the passage of the blast, and preventing the formation of &quot; rat-holes &quot; or passages of least resistanceThe Committee has been informed that mechanical producers having a capacity substantially in excess of that of normal types are in operation abroad, but no evidence is available as to whether the problems inci-dental to producers of such a capacity have been satisfactorily solved. Successful developments in this direction, however, might be expected to have a favour-able bearing upon the question of power production by the application of recovery producer practice.G-as-nred Boilers.A special memorandum constituting Section VIII; of the Appendix is devoted to the subject of gas-fired boilers.
SECTION   VII.GASIFICATION OF PEAT FOR POWERPRODUCTION.Consideration is given in another Appendix (Appen-dix V., Section XIII.) to the potential value of the peat deposits in the United Kingdom as a source of ammonia nitrogen. It is there pointed out that the gasification of peat fuel containing from 35 to 50 per cent, of moisture in recovery producers is a straight-forward process, but that the development of the process on a large scale is essentially dependent upon the introduction of an economical method of recovering and drying raw peat in large quantities throughout the year, irrespective of climatic conditions. It is also shown that the power gas obtained in the process is sufficient not only to meet the requirements of the recovery producer plant, but also to provide a surplus for external use.Peat has therefore a two-fold value as a potential source both of combined nitrogen and also of power gas, and it is important to investigate the possibilities that would be opened up in the direction of power production with by-product recovery by the successful commercial development of a method of drying raw peat in bulk.The information summarised below is based upon the average results obtained at peat installations of moderate capacity in successful operation abroad, and also at a large-scale trial plant in this country.BASIC DATA AND METHOD OF INVESTIGATION.The data upon which the present investigation is based are set out under the following paragraphs: Character of Peat Fuel.It has been assumed that the recovery producers are supplied with peat fuel containing 35 to 50 per cent, of moisture, and thus suitable for direct gasification. Experience at power installations abroad has shown that in order to obtain the best power gas for firing boilers and for use in gas engines, and to ensure the most efficient working of the recovery producers, it is desirable that the moisture content of the peat fuel as fired should be reduced to about 35 or 40 per cent. At two such installations, every effort has been made to keep the moisture content at a figure of 32 to 35 per cent.The nitrogen content has been taken at 115 per cent., and the calorific value at 8,500 B.Th.U. per lb., both figures being reckoned in terms of theoretically dry peat.Yield of Products.Large scale trials have established the fact that the average yield of power gas to be expected when peat fuel of the above character is gasified under ammonia recovery conditions amounts to 85,000 cu. ft. per ton of dry peat. The gas has a gross calorific value of 156 B.Th.U. and a nett calorific value of 140 B.TLU. per cu. ft. A certain proportion has to be used for meeting the requirements of the producer plant as indicated later.About 70 per cent, of the nitrogen content of peat can be recovered in the form of ammonia, corresponding to a yield of 114 lb. of ammonium sulphate (25 per cent. NH;I), per ton of dry peat containing 1-5 per cent, of nitrogen. From data relating to large scale operations, it appears that a yield of 100 lb. of sulphate can be relied upon under average working conditions in gas-fying peat of the quality indicated, and this figure has been adopted.The amount of tar recovered from a peat fuel con-taining about 35 per cent, of moisture is equal to about 6 per cent, of the weight of fuel gasified, results of this order having been obtained at more than one installa-tion. The yield is equivalent to about 9 per cent, on the weight of dry peat, and the approximate figure of 20 gals, of tar per ton of dry peat gasified has been adopted.The yields definitely adopted in the case of peat of the character previously specified are therefore as follows: YIELD PER TON OF DRY PEAT GASIFIED.Product.	Yield per Ton of dry Peat gasiiied.Power gas Ammonium sulphate Tar	8ii,000 cu. ft. (140 B.Th.U. nett). 100 lb. 20 gals.The aqueous distillate from the producers contains organic products such as acetic acid, acetone, and methyl alcohol. Definite evidence is not available as to the approximate yield of such products under average commercial conditions, and no account has therefore been taken of the potential source of revenue repre-sented by this class of by-product.Plant Requirements.In gasifying peat fuel containing from 35 to 50 per cent, of moisture under ammonia recovery conditions, the steam condensed in the water circulation regenerator towers is in excess of that obtained when gasifying coal, and much in excess of that needed for saturating the producer blast at a temperature of 730 0. There is difficulty in saturating the air in towers above 730 C, and as the best results are obtained when the producer blast is saturated at a temperature of 820 to 850 C, it is not easy in practice to utilise the extra steam. Since this further saturation can only be obtained by adding exhaust steam, additional steam has to be supplied from external sources. For peat of the quality specified, the nett requirements may be taken at one ton of low-pressure steam per ton of dry peat gasified, i.e., approximately proportional to the carbon value of peat as compared with that of coal.The vacuum evaporators of the ammonium sulphate plant require 3&apos;037 lb. of low-pressure steam per lb. of dry salt obtained, as indicated when dealing with the gasification of coal, or 304 lb. per ton of dry peat gasified.The nett quantity of low-pressure steam to be supplied from external sources thus amounts to 2,544 lb., or 1-135 tons per ton of dry peat gasified.The power required for the elevators, blowers, pumps, etc. of the recovery producer plant amounts to about 40 e.h.p. hours or 30 kw.-hours per ton of dry peat gasified per day. An installation dealing with say, 150 tons of peat fuel (35 per cent, moisture) pe. day, or approximately 55,000 tons per annum would, thus require a continuous supply of about 120 kw. if the needs of the plant were met electrically.Thermal Efficiencies of Boilers.The alternative figures previously utilised for the thermal efficiency of gas-fired boilers, namely, 75 and 90 per cent., have been adopted in dealing with the application of peat to power production.Scale of Power Plant.It would be commercially impracticable to rely upon such a low-grade material as raw peat, containing from 85 to 90 per cent, of moisture, for providing the fuel requirements of a large electric supply station. As shown later, the quantities required annually for such a station would be so large that the most exten-sive of peat bogs would be rapidly exhausted in meeting the requirements, even assuming it were economical to obtain, dry, and handle the quantities of raw peat in
Appendix iv. : gasification of peat.205question, Attention has therefore been confined to the possibilities of utilising peat for the generation of electricity upon a moderate scale, namely, in stations having an installed capacity of 6,250 lew. and a maximum load of 5,000 kw.From the point of view of thermal economy, gas engines have a distinct advantage over steam-turbo plant, and in dealing with power production on the scale just specified, alternative figures are given for steam turbo-electric and gas-engine electric plant.The fuel requirements and the capital and working expenses of the power plants are indicated later.Units of Comparison.The kilowatt and the kilowatt-year have been adopted as the units in terms of which the quantities and costs involved in the application of peat to power production are measured.Method of Investigation.The method adopted in applying the above data to the question of power production is similar to that adopted in the earlier sections of this Appendix.(a). USE OF STEAM TUREIn the case of a steam turbo-electric station of 5,000 kw., maximum demand, with units each of 1250 kw. capacity, and an annual load factor of 100 per cent., the fuel requirements of the station and auxili-aries are determined on the assumption that 1 kw.-hour for external use can be produced by supplying 26,670 B.Th.U. to the grate of boilers having a thermal efficiency of 80 per cent., corresponding to 28,450 B.Th.U. and 23,700 B.Th.U. respectively for boiler efficiencies of 75 and 90 per cent.Thermal Balance Sheet for Producer Plant.The gross yield of power gas obtained from a ton of dry peat amounts to 85,000 cu. ft., the nett calorific value of the gas being 140 B.Th.U. per cu. ft. The total thermal value of the gas is, therefore, 11 - 9 x 10&quot; B.Th.U, or 5,312 B.Th.U. per lb. of peat gasified. A certain proportion of the gas obtained per ton of dry peat has to be utilised for raising I-135 tons of steam for the producer plant, and the balance is available for power production.Consideration has been given to the two following methods of obtaining the low-pressure sceam required for the plant, namely : Method A. By raising it in separate gas-fired boilers at a gauge pressure of 5 lb. per sq. in.Method B. By tapping it from a low-pressure stage of the condensing turbines of the power station at a gauge pressure of 5 lb. per sq. in.In this case it has been assumed that the whole of the steam passed into the turbines is raised at a gauge pressure of 200 lb. per sq. in. and has a total temperature of 650o F., i.e., a superheat of 260o F. In the event of the steam being raised in low-pressure gas-fired boilers, the thermal balance sheet would be as follows: THERMAL BALANCE SHEET FOR PEAT GASIFICATION.Method A.Data.	B.TH.U. per.

The gaseous fuel needed for raising this extra steam must be debited against the producer plant in respect of the steam requirements of the latter. The thermal balance sheet in this case is as follows: THERMAL BALANCE SHEET FOR PEAT GASIFICATION.Method B.Data.

They indicate a sub-stantial gain in the thermal economy when the steam is taken from the turbines instead of being raised in separate low-pressure boilers. The quantity of high-pressure steam required by the turbines is in excess of that normally required to the extent of about 22 and 18 per cent, respectively for gas-firing efficiencies of 75 and 90 per cent.In considering the further aspects of power produc-tion by the gasification of peat in conjunction with steam turbo-electric plant, it will be assumed that the steam required for the recovery producers is derived from the main turbines, and the thermal&quot; efficiencies quoted in the last table will be adopted.Application to Power Production.A direct coal-fired station with steam turbo-electric units of 1,250 kw. capacity and boilers having a thermal efficiency of 80 per cent, would require the supply of 26,670 B.Th.U. to the boiler grate per kw.-hour at the switchboard after making allowance for the requirements of the station itself. The coal consump-tion per kw.-year of 8,760 hours available for external use would thus amount to 8 &quot;69 tons (calorific value 12,000 B.Th.U. per lb.)
Upon the basis of the figures previously given, the following table shows the overall thermal efficiency of a power installation with a section for gasifying peat, as compared with that of a coal-fired station, and also the total consumption of peat per kw.-year available for external use. The power requirements of the recovery producer plant itself have not been taken into account.POWER PRODUCTION via GASIFICATION OF PEAT.Steam Turbo-Electric Plant,Gas-firing Efpi-ciency taken at:	Percentage of gross yield of Power Gas available for power purposes after meeting requirements of Producers,	Comparative Overall Thermal Efficiency of Producer and Power Plant.

The figures for comparative overall thermal efficiency have been obtained in the manner indicated in previous cases.The whole of the fuel available for power produc-tion is in the gaseous form, and a substantial reduction of the order of 20 per cent, in the total consumption of peat would be effected by the employment of gas-fired boilers having a thermal efficiency of 90 instead of 75 per cent.The salient point revealed by the figures opposite is better indicated by the table below showing the quantities of producer fuel (35 to 50 per cent moisture) needed by the power installation per kw.-year available, and also the quantities of raw peat (85 to 90 per cent, moisture) that would have to be excavated and dried to meet the requirements of the plant.According to the efficiency of gas-firing, a steam turbo-electric station having an annual load factor of 100 per cent, and a nett output of 5,000 kw.-years of 8,760 hours would thus involve the employment of recovery producer plant capable of gasifying 102,500-128,500 tons of theoretically dry peat per annum in the form of 157,500-197,500 tons of producer fuel containing 35 per cent, of moisture, or 205,000-257,000 tons of peat fuel containing 50 per cent, of moisture. In order to provide these requirements, apart from any reserve of fuel, it would be necessary to obtain and dry 683,000 to 856,500 tons of raw peat containing 85 per cent, of moisture, or 1,025,000-1,285,000 tons of raw peat containing 90 per cent, of moisture.PEAT REQUIREMENTS FOR  STEAM TURBO-ELECTRIC INSTALLATION.

In the case of a bog having a, workable depth of 6 ft. of peat, the yield of dry peat would amount to about 864 tons per acre, so that the requirements of a steam turbo-electric station of the size specified would involve the stripping of from 119 to 149 acres per annum.The annual production of ammonium sulphate at such a station upon the basis of a yield of 100 lb. of sulphate per ton of dry peat containing 1 - 5 per cent, of nitrogen would amount to from 4,570 to 5,730 tons,It may be noted that the power requirements of the recovery producer installation, if met electrically, would account for a continuous supply of the order of 350 to 440 kw., i.ei, for about 7 to 88 per cent, of the nett output of the power station.Capital Cost.The estimated pre-war capital cost of a power station comprising five units of 1,250 kw. capacity, one being in reserve, is as set out in the table opposite, resuming a site in proximity to existing railway sidings t nd to a supply of water which would be available r-rith ordinary pumping for condensing purposes,The capital cost per kw. of maximum load is therefore estimated to be  18-25.In considering the relation between the capital costs of recovery producer plants for dealing respec-tively with coal and peat, account has to be taken of several factors, the most important of wluch is the relative rate of gasification of the two materials in a producer or specified dimensions. The evidence avail-able concerning commercial practice and large-scale trial operations points to the fact that compact or compressed peat fuel, such as would ordinarily be used, can be gasified at about twice the rate of coal.

received from an authoritative source indicate that a standard type of recovery producer with superheaters, capable of gasifying about 18 tons of ordinary bitu-minous coal per day of 24 hours, would deal with from 30 to 35 tons of peat fuel (40 per cent, moisture) in the same time. Upon this basis from 18 to 21 tons of dry peat would be gasified as compared with 18 tons of coal.When allowance is made for other factors such as the increased capacity of the handling and conveying appliances needed when dealing with peat, it may be taken as a close approximation that the capital cost per ton of dry peat gasified per annum is on a parity with the capital cost per ton of coal per annum. The figure of  0*69 per ton per annum given under a previous sub-heading has therefore been taken and hi inclusive of reserve plant equivalent to 15 per cent, of the running plant, as before. The producer installation must also be debited with the additional outlay incurred for the high-pressure boiler plant needed to compensate for the steam abstracted from the main turbines. This would amount to about 22 and 18 per cent, of the cost of the normal boiler plant for gas-firing efficiencies of 75 and 90 per cent, respectively.The outlay for the recovery producer installation would thus be as follows : CAPITAL COST OP PRODUCER SECTION.Scale : 5,000 lew. maximum demand.Items.	  per Kw. of maximum load, with Gas-firing Efficiency of:		75 per cent.	90 per cent.Eecovery      pro-ducers.

If peat is artificially dried down to a moisture content of from 15 to 25 per cent, and briquetted, the resulting peat fuel may have a density as great as, or even greater than, that of anaverage bituminous coal. It is improbable, however, that peat fuel of this character could be employed in gasification processes on account of the extra costs in-curred in its production\ Few figures appear to have been published concerning the space required for the storage of air dried peat turves such as might be used in re-, covery producers. Upon the basis of a figure that has been quoted; it, appears that peat turves containing 35 per cent, of moisture as stored in hoppers would probably occupy about 2 -25 times the space required for an equal weight of bituminous coal.An estimate, based upon a thorough study of the possibilities under British conditions in the light of trial operations on a large scale, to which consider -able weight must be given, places the cost of gasification at about 4s. 6d. per ton of peat fuel (35 per cent, moisture), inclusive of steam raising but exclusive of the cost of sulphuric acid for fixing the ammonia and also of capital charges. It is considered that a some-what lower figure might be realised for an installation on a larger scale than that previously specified. The above cost is approximately equivalent to 7s. per ton of theoretically dry peat, and has been provisionally adopted in order to enable the financial aspects of power production by the gasification of peat to be examined in further detail.The operating costs of the recovery producer in-stallation, exclusive of the cost of the peat fuel, would be as follows .- ANNUAL WORKING EXPENSES OF PRODUCER SECTION.Items.	  per Kw.-year of 8,760 Hours, with Gas-firing Efficiency of :		75 per cent.	90 per cent.Working expenses Capital charges at 10 per cent.

Th. U. per lb.) at 10s. per ton, equivalent on a calorific basis to about 7s. per ton for dry peat (8,500 B.Th.U. per lb.), the estimated cost of electrical energy by direct-firing at a station having an annual load factor of 100 per cent, and a nett output of 5,000 kw.-years would be  7-77 per kw.-year of 8,760 hours.An increase of Is. per ton in the price of dry peat affects the system to the extent of from 25 - 7s. to 20 - 5s. per kw.-year of 8,760 hours, according to the efficiency of gas-firing, whereas ah equivalent increase, on a calorific basis, in the price of coal would affect the cost by direct coal-firing to the extent of about 12-3s. per nett kw.-year. A variation in the market price of sulphate to the extent of  1 per ton of sulphate would modify the nett revenue, and hence the nett cost of electrical energy, by from 22-9s. to 18-3s. per full kw.-year in the two cases under consideration. The system is therefore very sensitive to fluctuations in the price of peat and in the market pi-ice of sulphate.With ammonium sulphate at the nett values of  6,  8,  10, and  12 per ton, and peat tar at the nett value previously taken, the prices of dry peat a^t Avhich the system could compete on an equality with direct-firing with coal at certain specified prices are shown in the table opposite, the thermal efficiency of gas-firing being taken at 75 per cent.LIMITING PRICES OF PEAT.With Gas-firing Efficiency of 75 per cent.Nett Revenue per ton of Sulphate.Maximum Price (in shillings per ton) of dry Peat to enable Gasification System to compete on an equality with Direct Coal-firing with Coal at the prices specified.Price of Coal in Shillings per ton-10*. 15,9. 20* 	s.	.. &apos;      *.	$.6	3-63	5-32	7-01oo	5-42	7-11	8-8010	7-20	8-90	10-5912	8-99	10-68	12-37With a nett revenue ranging from  6 to  10 per ton for ammonium sulphate it will be seen that the price of peat fuel (35 per cent, moisture) delivered at the instal-lation would have to be of the order of 3s. 6d. to 5s. 9d. per ton to enable the gasification system to compete on an equality with a direct-fired station utilising coal at 15s. per ton, or of 4s. 6cZ. to 7s. per ton with coal at 20s. per ton.

APPENDIX IV. : GASIFICATION OP PEAT.20b(b). USE OP GAS-ENGINE ELECTRIC POWER PLANT.In the case of a gas-engine electric power station of 5,000 kw. maximum demand with units each of 1,250 kw. capacity, the fuel requirements of the station and auxiliaries per kw.-hour available at the switch-board have been taken at the equivalent of 14,700 B,Th.TJ. (nett) supplied in the form of gaseous fuel to the cylinders of the engines when the latter are work-ing at full load under average conditions.Fuel Requirements for Power Production.The total calorific value of the power gas obtained by gasifying a ton of dry peat amounts to 85,000 x 140 -11-9 x 10l! B.Th.U. (nett), and the nett quantity of low pressure steam required for the recovery producer plant is 11135 tons.The exhaust gases from gas-engines have consider-able value for steam-raising purposes, and experience has established the fact that the gases from large engines in continuous operation are capable of raising 3 lb. of steam at a gauge pressure of 100 lb. per sq. in. per kw.-hour generated by the gas-engine electric plant. In practice, the steam from exhaust boilers would be passed through turbines or engines and thus used for generating power, the exhaust steam from such turbines, etc., then being utilised for meeting a portion of the requirements of the producer blast and the sulphate evaporating plant. The remainder of the low-pressure steam needed for the producer installa-tion could also be raised at a gauge pressure of 100 lb. per sq. in., and passed through turbines prior to its utilisation in the gasification process. It has been assumed that such expedients would be adopted.The nett steam requirements per ton of dry peat gasified amount to 2,240 lb. for the producer blast and to 304 lb. for the sulphate evaporators, a total of 2,544 lb. If an allowance of 10 per cent, is made for losses by condensation during the passage of the high pressure steam through theturbiues, the total quantity to be raised at a gauge pressure of 100 lb. per sq. in. amounts to 2544J7$ = 2,827 lb.Since the quantity of steam raised by the exhaust gases is 3 x JV lb., where N represents the number of kw.-hours generated per ton of dry peat gasified, the balance to be raised in gas-fired boilers at a gauge pressure of 100 lb. per sq. in. amounts to 2,827 -(3 X N) lb. Taking the thermal value of this steam at 1,185 B.Th.U. per lb. the thermal units required toraise it amount to(2,827 - 3JV) x 1,185B.Th.TJ. (nett), thermal efficiency of thewhere e represents the supplementary boilers.From the figures previously given, the thermal balance for the complete installation is given by the equation: N x 14,700 = 11 - 9 x 10fi - (2827 - 3JV) x 1185i.e. N ^(ex 11-9 x 106) - (2827 x 1185)(e x 14,700) - (3 x 1185)The following table indicates the principal figures for the system when the thermal efficiency of the supplementary boilers is taken at 75 per cent, and at 90 per cent.POWER PRODUCTION via GASIFICATION OF PEAT.

The figures in the first line (a) of the table will therefore be used in dealing with the remaining aspects of the question.Account has not yet been taken of the power generated by the turbines, which utilise the whole of the steam raised at a gauge pressure of 100 lb. per sq. in., and exhaust at a back pressure of, say, 5 lb. per sq. in. Upon the basis of a consumption of 30 lb. of steam per kw.-hour generated, an additional 2827 -- 94kw.-hours would be obtained from the turbo-electric plant per ton of dry peat gasified. From this must be deducted 30 kw.-hours for the power require ments of the recovery producer installation, thus leaving a nett balance of 64 kw.-hours per ton of dry peat gasified. The total output available for external use would therefore amount to 746 -f 64 = 810 kw.-hours, and the consumption of dry peat per kw.-year of 87608,760 hours would be gjrj = 10-8 tons.The table opposite shows the quantities of producer fuel (35 to 50 per cent, moisture) needed by the power installation per kw.-year available, and also the quantities of raw peat (85 to 90 per cent, moisture) that would have to be excavated and dried to meet the requirements of the plant.

These requirements would necessitate the obtaining and drying of 360,000 to 540,000 tons of raw peat, apart from the provision of reserve fuel. In the case cf a bog having a workable depth of 6 feet of peat, about 62 - 5 acres would have to be stripped annually to supply the peat fuel for the producer plant.With regard to the recovery of fixed nitrogen, an installation of the above size upon the basis of the
figures previously given would have an output of about 2,410 tons of ammonium sulphate per annum.Capital Costs.The capital cost of a gas-engine electric power station comprising five units each having a capacity of 1,250 kw., one being in reserve, including engines, generators, exciters, switchgear and connections, crane, cooling-water pumps, accessories including a non-condensing steam-turbo set, buildings, foundations and erection is estimated, upon a pre-war basis, to amount to  84,000, equivalent to  13&apos;44 per kw. installed, or to  16&apos; 8 per kw. of maximum load.The capital outlay for the recovery producers inclu-sive of reserve equivalent to 15 per cent, of the running plant, but exclusive of steam-raising plant, would amount, on the basis of the figures previously given, to 10 - 8 x  0-69 ^7 -45 per kw. of maximum load. The cost of the steam-raising section of a station of the size specified, inclusive of exhaust-gas boilers, supplemen-tary boilers and reserve, is estimated to amount to  5,000 or  1 per kw. of maximum load, thus bringing the cost of the complete producer section to  8 - 45 per kw. of maximum load and of the whole power station to  25 - 25 per kw. of maximum load.Operating Costs.The operating costs of the recovery producer section, inclusive of steam-raising but exclusive of capital charges and of the cost of sulphuric acid for fixing the ammonia, will be taken at the figure previously given, namely 4s. 6d. per ton of peat fuel (35 per cent, moisture) or about 7s. per ton of theoretically dry peat.The running costs of the gas-engine electric section are estimated as below upon the basis of the best modern practice and pre-war prices. It should be noted that the scale of salaries and wages is somewhat lower than that in the corresponding estimate for a steam turbo-electric station.ANNUAL WORKING EXPENSES OP A GAS-ENGINE ELECTRIC STATION.Scale : 5,000 hw. maximum demand.

The former is based upon a nett revenue of  10 per ton from ammonium sulphate and assumes that peat fuel containing 35 per cent, of moisture is delivered at the plant for about 4s. 8d. per ton, equivalent to approximately 7s. per ton of theoretically dry peat.The chart shows the effect of variations in the price of peat and inj the nett revenue from sulphate, and also embodies further data to which reference is made in a subsequent paragraph.POSSIBLE COST OP ENERGY via GASIFICATION OF PEAT.With Gas-engine Power Plant.

In the case of a gas-engine electric power station utilising coke-oven gas having a nett calorific value of 450 B.Th.U. per cu. ft. and costing 2d. per 1,000 cu. ft., i.e., equivalent on a calorific basis to about 7s. per ton for dry peat, the estimated cost of electrical energy amounts to  5-85 per kw.-year of 8,760 hours.An increase of Is. per ton in the cost of dry peat affects the system to the extent of 10-8s. per full kw.-year, while a variation in the market price of ammonium sulphate to the extent of  1 per ton of sulphate modifies the nett revenue, and hence the nett cost of electrical energy, by 9 - 6s. per full kw.-year.With ammonium sulphate at the nett values of  6,  8,  10, and  12 per ton, and peat^tar at the nett value previously taken, the prices of dry peat at which the system could compete on an equality with a direct coal-fired power station of equivalent size, using coal at certain specified prices, are shown in the following table:

In the case of coal costing 10s. per ton, the corresponding prices for peat fuel (35 per cent, moisture) would range from about 5-2s. to 7 - 6s. per ton delivered.As a further illustration, comparative figures may be given to indicate the relation between the costs incurred at gas-engine electric installations of 5,000 kw. maximum demand, relying upon the gasification of peat and of coal respectively for the provision of the necessary power gas. It will be assumed that the steam required for the gasification of coal under ammonia recovery conditions is obtained from exhaust gas boilers and supplementary boilers, that the whole of the steam is raised at a gauge pressure of 100 lb. per square inch, and that it is utilised in a turbine with a loss of 10 per cent, by condensation before being passed as exhaust steam to the producer plant. Taking the nett steam requirements of the blast and of the sulphate evaporators at 1 - 63 tons per ton of coal gasified, it can be shown, on the basis of previous data and in a manner similar to that adopted in dealing with the corresponding peat Ischeme, that 1,187 kw.-hours would be generated by the gas-engine plant for every ton of coal (12,000 B.Th.lT. per lb.) gasified, when the thermal efficiency of the supplementary gas-fired boilers is 75 per cent. The passage of the whole of the high-pressure steam through the turbine would produce a further 135 kw.-hours, so that after making allowance for the power requirements of the recovery producer plant, the nett output available for external ase would be 1,292 kw.-hours per ton of coal gasified, corresponding to the consumption of 8,760 -i- 1,292 ^ 6 -8 tons of coal per kw.-year of 8,760 hours.The capital cost of the recovery producers, including reserve, would thus be 6-8 x  0-69= 4-69 perkw.of maximum load. Taking account of the relative quantities of steam to be raised when coal and peat are gasified, the corresponding cost of the exhaust and supplementary boiler plant, including reserve, may be placed at  0 - 9 per kw. of maximum load, the total outlay for the complete gas-engine electric installation thus becoming  22-39 per kw. of maximum load, as compared with  25 - 25 in the case of the peat scheme.The working expenses, credits, and the nett cost of electrical energy are shown in a table in the next column, which is based upon a coal price of 10s. per ton, and a nett revenue of  10 per ton from the sale of ammonium sulphate.From an examination of the table it will be seen that an increase of Is. per ton in the cost of coal would affect the system to the extent of 6 - 8s. per full kw.-year, while a variation in the market price of ammonium sulphate to the extent of  1 per ton of sulphate modifies the nett revenue, and hence the cost of electrical energy, by 5 - 7s. per full kw.-year. These figures may be contrasted with the corresponding ones for a peat scheme.With ammonium sulphate at the nett values of  6,  8,  10 and  12 per ton in the case of both systems, and with other by-products at the nett values pre-POWER PRODUCTION aid GASIFICATION OF COAL:  GAS-ENGINE ELECTRIC PLANT.Scale : 5,000 kw. maximum demand.

With coal at 15s. per ton, and similar nett revenues, the corre-vsponding prices for peat fuel (35 per cent, moisture) would range from 5-9s. to 6-8s. per ton.A chart is given (Chart 10) to indicate the influence of varying nett revenues from the sale of ammonium sulphate, and of varying prices of peat fuel and coal upon the cost of generation at gas-engine electric power stations depending upon the gasification of peat and of coal respectively under ammonia recovery conditions.
(c). GENERALThe problem of utilising peat for power pro-duotion with by-product recovery differs in a number of aspects from the corresponding problem in the case of coal.In the first place, it is apparent that peat could never be relied upon for the generation of electrical energy on a really large scale on account of the enor-mous tonnage required by a large power installation, and of the annual drain upon even the largest of peat bogs, The considerations already presented and the results obtained abroad point, however, to the con-elusion that under favourable conditions peat could be utilised in conjunction with gas-engine electric plant for generating electrical energy on a moderate scale at a reasonably low cost. In order to secure the maximum economy in operation, it would be essential to instal such a power scheme at or adjacent to the bog itself to avoid the cost of transporting peat fuel, which is bulky. In the next place, peat bogs suitable for development are seldom found close to industrial centres, and only in a few cases in districts which are well served from the point of view of transport facilities. The conditions would not, in general, be conducive to the establishment of electro-chemical or other power-consuming industries in the neighbourhood of the power installation, and in the absence of any large demand in the immediate vicinity, the power would have to be transmitted to other centres. The additional capital expenditure and standing charges thus incurred would handicap a peat scheme which had to face the competition of coal-fired power stations at the centres themselves. In Ireland, however, where a comparatively small quantity of coal is mined and the cost is relatively high, these factors would probably be of less importance than in Great Britain. In the last place, the reclamation of land for agriculture is an important aspect of the peat problem, and in par-ticular cases the increment in the value of the bog land when cleared of peat might contribute substantially to the general economy of a peat utilisation scheme.Peat Consumption.Owing to the low calorific value of peat fuel, and of the low thermal efficiency of the gasification process even under the most favourable conditions, the fuel consumption of a power installation of moderate size is very large. Without taking account of reserve fuel, from 360,000 to 540,000 tons of raw peat have to be obtained and dried to a moisture content of from 35 to 50 per cent, to meet the annual requirements of a gas-engine electric station of 5,000 kw. maximum demand operating at full load, and from 2 to 2- 5 times this quantity for a gas-fired steam turbo-electric station of equivalent size.Price of Peat. IThe price at which peat fuel is available at the producers is a factor of the greatest importance in determining the general economy of any power scheme. In the case of a gas-engine electric station of the size under consideration, it will be seen from the figures previously given that every additional penny per ton in the cost of excavating, conveying and drying the raw peat would affect the price of the peat fuel delivered at the power station to the extent of  1,500 to  2,250 per annum, and hence the nett cost of electrical energy by from 6s. to 9s. per full kw.-year.In the case of two installations abroad where the conditions were particularly favourable, the moisture content of the raw peat being unusually low, namely, about 58 and 77 per cent, respectively, and the labour costs also low, the cost of obtaining, conveying, drying, and delivering the peat to the producers is said to have ranged between 9 - 8d. and 12- 6d. per ton of raw peat. (Appendix V., Section XIII.) As the result of a detailed examination of the possibilities at a large peat bog in Ireland, where the raw peat contains about 85 per cent, of moisture, it was estimated (in 1906) that the cost of excavating and of delivering peat fuel (35 per cent, moisture.) to the producers by the most up-to-date methods and plant, would be of the order of813d. per ton of raw peat under the conditions then prevailing in the district, apart from a small additional cost involved in working the drying-tunnels through which the peat was passed on its way from the bog.The above figures and those given in a later Appendix (Appendix &apos;V., Section XIII.), for the cost of handling other materials in bulk, afford an idea as to the order of the costs that may have to be incurred in any peat scheme merely in obtaining and drying the fuel neces-sary for running the installation. The development of . other methods of dealing with the raw material, for example, the pumping of macerated peat, would serve to avoid to a considerable extent the handling of solid products, and might lead to a reduction in the cost of winning peat, provided the subsequent drying could be economically effected.Conservation of By-Products.Apart from the yield of organic by-products, sue h as acetic acid, acetone, etc., upon which question no definite information is available, the output at a power installation having a maximum demand of 5,000-kw. and operating a full load is summarised in the follow h table: YIELD OP BY-PRODUCTS IN PEAT GASIFICATION POWER SCHEMES.By-Prodncts and Yield per Ton of dry Peat of quality previously specified.

Of the above revenues, over 70 per cent, is derived from the sale of ammonium sulphate, and-the importance of a sustained market price for this by-product is thus apparent. In dealing with power schemes depending upon the treatment of coal for by-product recovery, reference was made to the prospects of the competition of synthetic nitrogen compounds. It must also be noted that the cost of recovering ammonium sulphate at a peat installation would, in general, be greater than that at any ordinary producer-gas works owing to the greater cost of sulphuric acid delivered at the peatbog, and to the extra charges for freight incurred in marketing the sulphate. These factors would operate to reduce the nett revenue below that obtainable from a recovery plant located in or near an industrial centre.   On the
other hand, the value of the organic by-products previously referred to might prove to be more than a countervailing asset.Variations in the Quality of Peat.The whole of the figures given above are based upon the assumed employment of peat having a calorific value of 8,500 B.Th.U. per lb. and a nitrogen content of 1*5 per cent., both calculated on the theoretically dry product. Any departure from these values will affect the general position of the power schemes, and the ehai-acter of the modifications thus introduced is briefly referred to below.If the peat available had a calorific value lower than 8,500 B.Th.TJ..per lb., a larger quantity would be required per kw.-year generated, thus involving a producer section of greater capacity and a consequent increase in the capital and operating costs, apart from the cost of the extra peat fuel. Providing the nitrogen content of the dry peat still remained at 1*5 per cent, there would also be an increase in the nett revenue on account of the larger production of ammonium sulphate.Uniformity in the nitrogen content of a bog is a most important factor in any peat utilisation scheme, as will be appreciated from previous remarks, and a high content of nitrogen is obviously desirable. In the case of some bogs, the figure ranges from 2 to 3 per cent., and the high yield of ammonium sulphate obtainable from peat of this quality would represent a very substantial improvement in the financial economy of a power installation. Upon the basis of the figures previously given, every addition of 0 - 5 per cent, in the nitrogen content of the peat would augment the revenue from the sale of ammonium sulphate to the extent of 33 per cent. It has been stated that it would not be commercially profitable to utilise peat for ammonia recovery if its nitrogen content were less than 1- 5 per cent.Capital and Operating Costs.The advantage of gas-engine electric plant for a peat gasification scheme as contrasted with steam turbo-electric plant is clearly demonstrated by the lower capital and operating costs in the former case consequent upon the higher thermal efficiency of gas-engines and the much smaller scale of the necessary recovery producer installation. The capital outlay for a complete power station with producers and gas-engine plant would be about 50 per cent, greater than that for a gas-engine station alone utilising power-gas purchased from an external source,Nett Cost of Electrical Energy.A general indication of the possible cost of genera-tion at power stations involving the utilisation of peat is afforded by the table in the next column. It is assumed that peat fuel (35 per cent, moisture) of the quality previously specified could be delivered at the plant at a price ranging from 3s. 3ii. to 6s. 6eZ. per ton, equivalent to from 5s. to 10s. per ton of dry peat, that a nett revenue of  10 per ton could be obtained. from the sale of ammonium sulphate, and a nett revenue of 2d. per gallon obtained for peat tar.Prom the financial point of view it is clear that a gas-engine electric scheme shows to much better advantage than a steam turbo-electric scheme, being less influenced by variations in the price of peat, or by fluctuations in the, market prices of the by-products.In order to place a coal-fired steam turbo-electric station upon an equality with an equivalent station utilising recovery producers and peat fuel (35 per cent, moisture) at 3s. 3iJ. to 6s. 6d per ton, the corresponding price for coal (12,000 B.Th.U. per lb.) would have to range from about 315s. to 18- 2s. per ton if the nett revenue from by-products at the peat installation were as specified in the table. Por equivalent gas-engine electric stations depending respectively upon the gasification of peat and of coal, the price of coal would have to range from 6s. 3d. to 14s. per ton in order to place the two schemes on an equality (with peat fuel taken at the above prices, and with a, nettPOSSIBLE COST OP ELECTRICAL ENERGY via GASIFICATION OF PEAT.With peat &apos;fuel (35 per cent, moisture) at 3s. 3cZ. to 68. 6d. per ton, ammonium sulphate at  10 per ton (nett), and peat tar at 2d. per gal.

When account is taken of the possible demand for power in the neighbourhood of a peat bog, it is im-probable that this condition of affairs could be realised, and in the case of a station supplying the variable demands of ordinary industrial consumers at a moderate load factor, the cost of electrical energy per unit output or per full k\v.-year would be considerably increased. Reference was made under an earlier sub-heading to the influence of the load factor, and the observations then made apply, in general, to peat gasification schemes, although a slight further modification is introduced on account of the fact that, with diminished load, the efficiency of gas-engines falls off somewhat faster than that of steam turbines. As previously stated, the results indicated in the case of plants operating continuously at full load are not capable of application in detail to power schemes involving reduced and variable load factors, although they afford an approximate idea of the comparative results that might be expected.Prospects and Difficulties.It is clear that if peat fuel (35 per cent, moisture) could be manufactured on a large scale in the United Kingdom at a cost comparable with the figures claimed to have been realised at favourably situated instaila-tions abroad, namely, from 2s. (id. to 4s. 6d. per ton, or even at a somewhat higher cost in view of the rising price of coal, the prospects of utilising peat for power production on a moderate scale with by-product recovery as an auxiliary would be distinctly promising.
The realisation of these prospects, it must again be emphasised, is essentially dependent upon the devising of a method of continuously obtaining and drying raw peat in quantity throughout the year at a cost which will permit of the delivery of the peat fuel at the power station at prices not greater than a few shillings per ton.   The attempts already made in this direction and the difficulties to bo overcome in solving the problem are described in detail in another Appendix (Appendix V., Section XIII), The potential value of peat as a source of power and of combined nitrogen will un-doubtedly stimulate further elforts, especially when regard is had to the continuous upward trend in the price of coal,GAS-FIRED BOILERS.TEMPERATURE DIAGRAM FOR &quot;BONECOURT&quot; TUBE FOR BOILING ATATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE. (Sec page 215.)
SECTION YIII.GAS-FIRED BOILERS.Note. This memorandum on gas-fired boilers was prepared in December 1916 by a member of the Gas-Firing Sub-Committee of tbe Power Sub-Committee. It constituted an Appendix to the Report of the Gas-Firing Sub-Committee, and was referred to in that Report in the following terms: &quot;In view of &quot; the evident thermal advantages possessed by a gas-fired boiler of the Bonecourt type, the Sub-Committee has &quot; given very careful consideration to the matter; a special memorandum on the subject forms Appendix I. &quot; to this Report. In the opinion of tho Sub-Committee, the design of boiler therein indicated, which is not &quot; intended to be more than suggestive, is worthy of development, and shows the general lines on which a &quot; gas-fired boiler with superheater and feed-water heater should be designed.&quot;On the assumption that the Power Sub-Committee might be recommended to adopt a system of fuel dis-tillation for power production which would involve the use of gas-fired boilers, I have given some consideration to the best type of boiler for the purpose.Two types of boilers are possible: either (1) the well-known makes of water-tube boiler, with certain modifications to the standard brickwork arrangement in the combustion chamber; or, (2) the fire-tube shell-type boiler of the Bonecourt Waste Heat Boiler Com-pany. The former type is of proved value for coal burning, but has not been used to any extent for gas burning ; the latter type has not got very much beyond the experimental stage.If it were not for the great difference in the efficiencies claimed for the two types, namely, 70 per cent, in the case of water-tube gas-fired boilers, and 90 per cent, for the Bonecourt type, no practical engineer would recommend a boiler of the shell type, particularly for high pressures, but would always prefer to use the water-tube type. The high efficiency claimed for the Bonecourt boiler, however, is sufficient to warrant very close investigation into its merits, as economy of fuel is one of the principal aims.The Bonecourt boiler, as shown on drawings and papers submitted to this Sub-Committee, consists of a large cylindrical shell, with flat front and back plates. The standard length of the shell is 15 feet (13 feet between end plates), and the diameter is given as varying up to 15 ft. 6 in. A number of straight tubes, up to 175 in the largest size, 13 feet long and 6 inches diameter, pass through the shell from the front to the back plate, into both of which they are secured by expanding.The tubes are filled with refractory packing, and a separate gas inlet jet is arranged at the front end of each tube where the mixture of gas and air is burned. The refractory packing becomes incandescent, and, according to Professor Bone, the gas and air mixture is burned by &quot; surface combustion,&quot; without flame, on the face of the packing. The heat is transmitted directly through the tubes to the water in the boiler. The radiation losses are thus very small, and this is probably the chief reason of the high efficiency.An exhaust fan is used at the back of the boiler to draw the gases through the tubes, and an average rate of evaporation as high as 20 lb. (from and at) per square foot of tube heating surface is claimed when a suction equal to 16 inches of water is used. According to figures given, the average evaporation appears to be proportional to the square root of the suction draught, as if the suction is reduced from 16 inches to 4 inches the average evaporation is reduced from 20 lb. to 10 lb. per square foot.The actual rate of evaporation varies considerably over the length of the tubes. The highest rate is obviously within the combustion zone, and the Bone-court catalogue gives 70 per cent, as taking place in the first third of the tube length, 20 per cent, in the second third, and 10 per cent, in the last third. This is when the boiler is evaporating at the average rate of 20 lb. per square foot, and is equivalent to 42 lb. per square foot for the first third, 12 lb. for the second third, and 6 lb. for the last third.I have endeavoured to reconcile these evaporative rates with the range of temperature within the tubes,and have used for this purpose the curve given on p. 8 of a pamphlet, entitled Bonecourt Boilers (dated February, 1913), issued by Bonecourt Surface Com-combustion, Ltd. A copy of this curve (which is repro-duced on the opposite page) is also given as Fig. 119 of the paper read by Dr. Essich (Mitteilungen der Berlin-Anlialtischen Maschinenbau A.G., March, 1914, pp, 103-117; April, 1914, pp. 124-132), where the &quot; Schnabel-Bone &quot; boiler is described.Although in both cases this temperature curve is shown as referring only to very short tubes (3 feet long and 1 m. long respectively), it may fairly be assumed that it could be expanded to apply equally to longer tubes, provided the maximum and exit temperatures were not materially different. The maximum temperature will depend upon the quality of the gas burned, and is given in the pamphlet The Bonecourt System of Surface Combustion (undated, but probably 1914), as follows : 	Mean Calorific	Maximum-   Gas.	Value per	Temperature	Cubic Foot.	Obtainable.	B.Th.U.	0C.Coal gas -     -     -     -Coke-oven gas -	j      560	1,950Producer gas -	140	1,500Blast Furnace gas -	95	1,250Water gas	290	1,900Natural gas	900	1,800The maximum temperature shown in the curve mentioned is l,400o C, from which it would appear that producer gas was used. The exit temperature is given as 170c C, which is a little lower than that given on p. 10 of the Bonecourt catalogue for a 13-foot long tube, namely, 1980 C.The sensible heat content of the products of com-combustion of a given volume of gas will depend upon the calorific value of the gas, while the temperature will depend upon the specific heat. The lower the specific heat, the higher will be the temperature to which a given amount of heat will raise the products of com-combustion. A curve is given in Mr. McCourfs paper on the Bonecourt boiler (Journal of the Institute of Electrical Engineers, Vol. 52, No. 236), showing the sensible heat content of producer gas as compared with the tempera -ture, and I have applied the values to the temperature curve mentioned above.In this way the first third of the length of the boiler tube would evaporate about 60 per cent., the second third about 30 per cent., and the last third about 10 per cent., but only by spreading out the temperature curve so that its origin is at the beginning of the tube, instead of at about 10 per cent, of the length within the tube, as shown in the Bonecourt curve.It is obvious that both the temperature range and the evaporative rates can be varied within limits by the disposition and arrangement of the refractory material and by the kind of gas employed. This is pointed out in Mr. McCourt&apos;s paper, in which he says: &quot; For a given kind of packing in the tubes, there must be preserved a definite ratio between the length
and bore of tho tubes in order to obtain sufficient cooling of the combustion gases. Thus, when tubes of 3-inch bore are employed the length is generally 3 feet or 4 feet. In this case the ratio of length to bore is 12 to 1 or 16 to 1. If it is desired to use longer tubes of the same bore, this may bo done without sacrificing considerations of economy by employing a packing material of a more open nature in the tubes, It is clear that the more closely the refractory material is disposed in the tubes the steeper will be the tempera-ture gradient from end to end. By suitably selecting the packing for the tubes we have found that we can very effectively employ in boiler construction tubes ranging from 3 inches in bore and 3 feet long to tubes 12 inches in bore and 24 feet long. It will be seen that this affords great latitude in boiler design, enabling boiler shells to be made from 3 feet to 24 feet in length and any desired diameter.&quot;The Bonecourt boiler has, so far, not been made for higher working pressures than about 120 lb. per square inch, which is too low for economical use in modern steam turbines. The Company has, however, submitted to the Sub-Committee drawings for a boiler for 250 lb. working pressure, of which the particulars are as follows : External diameter of shell     -     -     - 10 ft.  -Thickness of shell    - 1-$ inch.Length over end-plates   -   &apos; -     -     - 13 ft.Thickness of end-plates   - H in.Length of shell overall     -      -     -     - 14 ft.No. of gas tubes..... 04.Inside diameter of gas tubes    -     -     - 0 in.Outside     ,,,,,,        - 0  in.Total tube heating surface - - - 1,387 sq. ft. Evaporation per hour   (from   and   at100o C.)...... 25,000 lb.Evaporation per hour pcrsq. ft. of heatingsurface ------- 18 lb.,,A chamber is formed outside the back end-plate, where the products of combustion meet before going through the suction fan, in which are to be placed the vertical trunk pipes, 2 inches diameter, of a superheater arrangement. The temperature of the gases at that point is far too low for any superheating effect, and therefore the superheater pipes themselves are to con-sist of half-inch bore pipes, branched out from the 2-inch trunk pipes.Bach of the half-inch pipes is connected to one of the inlet trunk pipes, is then carried down inside one of the gas tubes to a point about 4 feet from the front end, bent backwards and forwards 12 times on itself in lengths of 6 feet, and then brought out again at the back end and connected to one of the outlet trunk pipes.The first drawing shows 10 inlet and 10 outlet trunk pipes, with 64 branch pipes, i.e., one in each gas tube; but the second drawing, received a few days later, shows only six inlet and six outlet trunk pipes and 42 branch pipes. In the later design, therefore, 22 of the gas tubes are not provided with superheater pipes.Judging from the temperature curve, the tempera-ture of the gases in the tubes at the position where the superheater pipes are nested would range between 8003 C. and 600o C, which would be sufficient to give a high superheat say up to a total temperature of 300o C. or 350o C. The exact position of the nesting could, of course, be varied according to the amount of superheat required.It is clear that no refractory material can be used in that portion of the gas tubes where the superheater pipes are nested. The second drawing shows the Bonecourt standard arrangement of spirally-set bricks up to that point, and a form of plug, nearly filling the diameter of the tube, at the back end. The object of this latter type of refractory material is evidently merely to confine the passage of the gases to a narrow ring, close up to the interior surface of the tube.In my opinion the whole of the proposed super-heater arrangement is very defective. The bending of each pipe to lie in a congested nest within a 6-inch diameter tube is bad. Each of the branch pipes would have two steam joints which connect it to the trunk pipes. There would be, in addition, the joints between the trunk pipes and the inlet and outlet steam headers. These make a total of 148 high-pressure steam joints jn the first design and 96 in the second, the failure ofany one of which would be sufficient to shut the boiler down.The use of such a large number of independent small pipes for the superheater is not good. The standard size for such work is about l^-inch bore, but the limitations imposed by placing each pipe inside a gas tube prevent anything larger than about  -inch bore being used.That part of the superheater arrangement which is contained outside the gas tubes within the back chamber would have, according to the first drawing, an area of about 180 square feet, and, according to the second drawing,&apos; an area of about 120 square feet, the whole of which, being filled with superheated steam, would be at a temperature of probably 1000 0. higher than that of the surrounding exit gases. The result must be that the steam temperature would be con-siderably reduced at that point. The fact that two superheater arrangements, with considerably different areas, have been submitted within a week or two of each other, shows that this part of the Bonecourt boiler has not at present got beyond the drawing-office stage.It follows, both from the temperature curve and from the stated evaporative rates over the various sections, that the back half of the length of each 13-foot Bonecourt tube is doing comparatively little towards the total steam raising, probably not more than 20 per cent, of the total work being done in that portion.One of the chief objections to the Bonecourt boiler as at present designed for high pressures, is that it is essentially of the shell type. The lar-ge diameter employed to accommodate the number of gas tubes required entails the use of a very thick shell-plate, the thickness being, of course, independent of the length of the shell. The total weight of the boiler proposed for 250 lb. pressure, with a shell 10 feet diameter and 14 feet long, would be about 20 tons, which would have to be handled in one piece, and would make- rail and road transit very difficult.It appears to me, however, that a much better commercial design would be obtained by dividing the complete boiler unit into three sections, each of which could be built separately, with a correspondingly less weight to handle in one piece.For example, a boiler for an evaporation of 25,000 lb. of water per hour from and at 1000 C, and for a working pressure of 250 lb. per square inch, could have for the first section a shell 10 feet diameter by 7 feet long, with 66 gas tubes, 6 inches diameter. These would give a total tube-heating surface of about 757 square feet, or about 54 per cent, of that in the Bonecourt Company&apos;s design. The tubes would be filled with refractory material so arranged that the exit temperature of the gases would be about 600o O, and, from the evaporation curve, it may be assumed that the first 4 feet of the length of the tubes would evaporate at an average rate of about 42 lb. per square foot, and the next 3 feet at an average rate of about 15 lb. per square foot. This would give a mean evaporative rate for the first section of about 30 lb. per square foot, and, on this basis, this section of the boiler should evaporate about 22,700 lb. per hour.The second section would consist of a steel super-heater chamber, say 10 feet diameter by 2 ft. 9 in. long, in which would be suspended a vertical nest of superheater tubes, 1  inches diameter. Thirteen loops, each consisting of three tubes, could be accommodated, and these would give a total effective heating surface of about 330 square feet. The steam headers would be arranged horizontally at the top of the superheater chamber, and any individual set of tubes could be readily withdrawn. There would be only 26 steam joints, as against 148 (or alternatively, 96) in the Bonecourt arrangement, and practically the whole pipe surface would be in the direct line of the travel of the gases.I have not worked out the exact heating surface which would be necessary to raise the temperature of the steam from saturation point (210o C), to, say, 300o O, but the area of the superheater tubes could be increased without any difficulty. The temperature of the gases across the superheater section would be lowered from about 600o C. to about 400o C, at which they would enter the third section.


This would consist of another shell, say (i ft. 6 in. diameter by 3 feet long, containing a number of heating tubes of 3 inches diameter. As many as 91 could easily be accommodated, and these would give a total heating surface of about 2,390 square feet, which is probably a great deal, larger than would be necessary. Refractory material should be arranged so as. to keep the gases against the surfaces of the tubes and so that the final exit temperature would be just above the saturated steam temperature, say 230o 0.The feed water (already heated from the hot well) would be pumped into the bottom of the third section, and would pass out of the top by means of a pipe connection to the feed water distributing pipe at the back end of the first section.The great range of temperature along the tubes of the first section (say from l,400o 0. to 600o 0.) should be sufficient to ensure rapid circulation of the water in that section, without the necessity of any circulating pipe connections between the first and third sections. Owing, however, to the fact that a certain amount of steam would be given off in the third section, it might be necessaiy to provide a steam dome above the water level, and to connect it to the steam dome of the first section.The total evaporative capacity of a boiler coi:.-structed in this manner should not be any less than that of the design submitted by the Bonecourt Company.In a letter dated September 4th, 1916, from the British Engine, Boiler and Electrical Insurance Co., Ltd., to the Munitions Inventions Department, it is stated that &quot;at the present time the chief difficulty &quot; in connection with the installation of the Bonecourt &quot; boilers is the lack of a suitable arrangement for &quot; superheating.&quot;The arrangement I have suggested should meet the difficulty, and is very similar to that shown in Pig. 124 of Dr. Essich&apos;s paper, although the gas tube lay-out and the details are different. In fact, a study of Dr. Essich&apos;s paper seems to indicate that the Bone-court Company in England is considerably behind the &quot; Schnabel-Bone &quot; people in Germany in many practical details.I attach a drawing showing the design (see Diagram) of the boiler and superheater suggested.The large diameter shell which is necessary in the Bonecourt type of boiler, when made for large outputs, entails the use of large flat end-plates, which have to be efficiently stayed. In the Bonecourt design for 250 lb. pressure, eight longitudinal stay bolts, 3 inches diameter, are shown at and above the water line, while 20 out of the the 64 gas tubes are used as stays below that level.The Bonecourt catalogue (page 14), says: &quot; The &quot; boiler is easily cleaned on the water side, as the &quot; tubes are divided into nests, and ample room is left &quot; for a man to get between the nests to clean them.&quot; The vertical space between the nests is only 131 inches wide, and even that space is effectively blocked at the top by two of the longitudinal stay bolts. A re-arrangement of these would therefore be necessary, and I have shown oidy six stay bolts in my drawing, which should be sufficient.The stay bolts are secured to the end-plates by internal and external nuts, which will prevent either collapsing or bursting, and, as the stay bolts are always at the same temperature as the shell, the water, and the steam, the longitudinal expansion and con-traction of the shell and the stay bolts should be equal.The 20 gas tubes, which are also used as stays, are provided with external nuts only, and therefore cannot prevent collapsing except by the Motional hold of the tubes in the end-plates due to the expanding tool. The whole of the tubes will act equally in this respect, and, with such a large number, would probably be sufficient. It is impracticable to use internal nuts, owing to the inaccessibility of the parts.It is difficult to estimate the linear expansion of the tubes when the boiler is at work. The average temperature of the gases over a 13-foot tube would probably be about 760o C, while the temperature of the water on the outside would be 210o 0. (at 250 lb, steam pressure). In the furnace tubes of Lancashire and Marine type boilers either corrugated tubes or special expansion joints have to be used, and the faci that the Bonecourt tubes are only 6 inches diameter, as against about 3 feet diameter in the other types, does not affect the linear expansion if the temperatures are comparable. It is certain, therefore, that the expan-sion of the Bonecourt gas-fired tubes, 13 feet long, must be sensibly above that of the stay bolts, and must, in consequence, put severe strains on the end-plates and the joints.The Bonecourt boiler at the works of the Skinnin-grove Iron Company has tubes only 4 feet long, and it is quite possible that with such short tubes no difficul-ties have been experienced. The Bonecourt Company has had little or no working experience with boilers with 13-foot tubes, and, in my opinion, the use of such long tubes is a great mistake, and will lead to serious trouble in operation.On page 14 of the Bonecourt catalogue it is stated: &quot; Besides the variation in output which&apos; can be effected &quot; by varying the draught, any number of tubes can be &quot; operated, and any number may be left out of action ,( by merely capping such tubes and closing the corre-&quot; sponding gas valves.&quot; While this might be quite possible, the fact that the tubes so capped would be at water temperature only, while their close neigh-bours would have the high temperature&apos;gases passing through them, appears to have been overlooked. Such a procedure must set up heavy local strains.If a method of reducing the output by reducing the draught, while keeping all the&apos; tubes at work, is not sufficient, some modification of the scheme indicated in Figs. 124, 126, 127, and 130 of Dr. Essichs paper seems to be worthy of consideration. Large diameter gas tubes are shown, each having several gas burners, and it would be easy to reduce the output of a boiler by shutting off a corresponding number of burners in each tube. By this means there would be no variations between the mean temperature of all the gas tubes. To sum up my conclusions :--(1) The system of gas-firing in tubes is apparentlyso efficient that it must be considered. (2) No Bonecourt boilers for high pressures and large outputs have yet been made. (3) The designs submitted by the Bonecourt Company for such boilers, with or without superheaters, are.not satisfactory. (4) It is quite possible to design and manufacture a satisfactory gas-fired boiler, with all the thermal advantages of the Bonecourt type.I hope these remarks will be of service to the Sub-Committee.(Signed) J. H. Rider.December 28th, 1916.Note. In consequence of the time that has elapsed since the above memorandum was prepared, it was considered desirable by the Chairman of the Committee to submit it to the Bonecourt Waste Heat Boiler Co., Ltd., for their comments, and this was done in March 1919 while the Report was in the proof stage. I have had an opportunity of considering the observations made by the Company, but having regard to all the circumstances and to the information available to me in December 1916 I have deemed it undesirable to modify the original memorandum. With regard, however, to conclusion (3), h must be stated that considerable improvements in the design of high-pressure boilers of the Bonecourt type have been effected in the interval, as was to have been expected. The great objections to a single-shell boiler, when used for large outputs and high pressures, are (a) the necessarily excessive thickness of the shell and end-plates and (6) the transport difficulties due to the large size and heavy weight. In this connection it may be noted that the latest designs submitted by the Company in March 1919 comprise a plurality of small diameter shells. In respect also of the superheater and of other details, these designs differ radically from those proposed in 1916.April 11th, 1919. (Signed)     J. H. R.

INTRODUCTION.This Appendix contains a summary of all the evidence available to the Sub-Commit tee concerning the costs involved in operating the various nitrogen recovery and fixation processes. It has been deemed unnecessary, in view of the publications available on the subject, to give more than a brief description of the chemistry of the Established processes or of the plant required for their operation. The partly developed processes, however, have been dealt with in somewhat greater detail. In all cases a resume is given of the information collected by the Sub-Committee concerning technical details of importance from the manufacturing point of view or having an influence upon the capital expenditure or working costs.Figures for the costs incurred in the commercial working of several of the established processes or industries have been supplied by authorities who are or have been actually engaged in their operation on a large scale. In other cases, considerable difficulty has been experienced in obtaining authoritative figures, and it has only been possible to arrive at approximate costs after a careful examination of conflicting evidence in the light of manufacturing experience in similar industries.With. regard to processes that have been tried upon a semi-commercial scale but have not hitherto been established in this country or abroad, the figures for costs are based upon the claims made for the processes, and remain to be substantiated by large-scale commercial operation.The figures representing the considered opinion of the Sub-Committee as to the capital and production costs involved in operating the established processes are summarised in tabular form at the end of the Appendix (Tables 1, 2, and 3). These figures, together with certain pre-war market prices which appear in the tables, are distinguished by bold type throughout the text.It must be emphasised that all costs are based upon pre-war conditions unless it is definitely stated to the contrary. Moreover, they do not include any allowance for royalties or like payments that might be incurred in the event of the establishment of some of the processes in this country. It is also important to note that the production costs represent the actual costs of the products at the factory, inclusive of all working expenses and of depreciation. They are exclusive, however, of any allowance for interest upon the capital cost of the chemical section of the factory as distinct from the electrical power section. In all cases where the cost of electrical energy is a factor in the production costs, the allowance made for this item has been taken as inclusive of a moderate charge for interest upon the capital cost of the power plant in addition to depreciation.The cost of marketing the products together with an allowance for profit on the manufacture must entail a substantial addition of, say, 20 to 25 per cent, to the costs at the factory, and this point must be kept in view when comparing factory costs with the market prices of products such as Chile nitrate and ammonium sulphate.Notes. It has been found convenient, in referring to various nitrogen products in terms of combined nitrogen, to make use of expressions such as &quot;nitrate nitrogen.&quot; &quot;nitric nitrogen,&quot; &quot;ammonia nitrogen,&quot; etc. These expressions, although not strictly accurate from a scientific standpoint, serve to avoid the employment of lengthy ph abes such as .&quot; combined nitrogen in the form of nitrates,&quot; &quot;combined nitrogen in the form of nitric acid,&quot; &quot; combined nitrogen in the form of ammonia,&quot; and the like.The metric ton has been used as a basis of comparison throughout the Appendix. In cases where the unqualified term &quot; ton &quot; is employed, it may be taken as indicating a long ton (2,240 1b.).   , ,
NITROGEN PRODUCTS COMMITTEE ! FINAL REPORT. SECTION I.CHILE NITRATE.The deposits of nitrate of soda in Chile constitute the world&apos;s great natural source of nitrate nitrogen, and upon this source every nation has hitherto been practically dependent. The export of nitrate irom Chile has increased enormously during the last twenty-five years, and in 1913 amounted to about 2,500,000 tons. Charts illustrating the expansion of the Chilean nitrate industry during the last ten years, and the correspond-ing market prices of nitrate in this country, are given at the end of the Appendix (Charts C, D and E).The abnormal conditions resulting from the war have brought into special prominence the question of the entire dependence of nations upon external supplies of nitrate. In the case of Germany, for example, the cessation of imports has necessitated the establishment of nitrogen fixation processes on a vast scale in order to make up the deficit of combined nitrogen and to meet the continually increasing demand for munitions. In thiB country also, reliance upon external supplies, in-volving the vital problem of. shipping, has exercised a serious influence upon the cost of the war.The probability of a large increase in the demand for fertilisers after the war, and the possibilities attach-ing to the production of synthetic nitrates, have rendered it necessary to examine in some detail the prospective position of the Chilean nitrate industry. The two most important aspects to be considered arc those relating&apos; to (1) the permanence of the deposits, and (2) the cost of production under pre-war conditions, the possible cost under post-war conditions, and the costs involved in placing the product upon the European market.PERMANENCE OP DEPOSITS.Various estimates have been published from time to time as to the probable life of the &quot; caliche&quot; deposits in Chile in face of the rapidly increasing demand. The views expressed as to the approaching exhaustion of the deposits appear to. require some modification as the result of a statement issued in 1913 by the Chilean Nitrate Committee under the auspices of the Chilean Embassy (The Times, Finance, Commerce, and Shipping Supplement, Nov. 22nd, 1913). The statement was based upon an official report made to the Chilean Government by Sefior Francisco J. Castillo, Inspector-General of Nitrate Deposits, and as it contains the most recent informa-tion available to the Sub-Committee, it is therefore&apos; quoted below.&quot; According to the latest official report presented to the Chilean Government by Senor Francisco J. Castillo, the Inspector-General of the Nitrate Deposits, the zone of nitrate-bearing grounds comprises 200,000 sq. kilometres, of which so far only 5,811 sq. kilometres, that is to say less than three per cent., arc examined, and their contents ascertained by excavations and test holes.V These 5,811 sq. kilometres belong to the existing companies, private firms, and in part are still in the hands of the Chilean Government.&quot; The calculated contents of these 5,811 sq. kilometres were 290,300,000 tons of Nitrate of Soda, of which up to the present 45,000,000 tons have been extracted and exported leaving in the examined part ofv the area 245,300,000 tons of Nitrate of Soda, equal, at the present rate of production, to a supply for a further 100 years.&quot; As the unexplored part is some 34 times larger than the explored grounds, it is safe to estimate that it contains altogether at least an equal quantity of Nitrate of Soda, and consequently the nitrate zone in Chile can certainly provide Nitrate of Soda for another 200 years at the present rate of production.&quot; The quantity of Nitrate of Sola in the examined grounds is sub-divided as follows : &quot; There remain in the Tons.Province of Tarapaca - - - 35.000,Ou0 Tocopilla District - - - 28,000,000 Antofagasi a (Central) - - - 32,000,000 Antofagasta (Agnas Blancas Dis-trict).....  49,000,000Taltal......  95,000,000Chanaral and Copiapo -     -     -    8,300,000Total 245,300,000*(* This total is given in the original statement.)&quot; The Inspector-General of Nitrate Deposits, in his Report to the Chilean Government, has arrived at these figures in the following way. In these examined grounds no raw material containing less than 11 per cent, of Nitrate of Soda has been taken into consideration, nor grounds where the thickness of the layer of the raw material, was less than one foot, except in the case of raw material of at- least 25 per cent, of Nitrate of Soda, when the thickness of eight inches and above has been included. The superficial area of each portion of ground examined has been divided by the total number of test holes made, in order to arrive at the area applicable to each test hole, and this consequently determines the total nitrate-bearing area. From the theoretical quantity of pure Nitrate of Soda resulting from the above operations a reduction of 40 percent, has been made in order to provide lor losses in extraction, manufacture, errors of calculation, etc.&quot; Of raw material of a lower grade vast quantities remain, which have been excluded from these calcula-tions because they cannot be profitably extracted under the present system of work ; but as improvements arc being constantly made there is every reason to assume that even this low grade material will be worked wh u the richer qualities arc exhausted.&quot; These statements therefore conclusively show that there is no fear of the Chilean nitrate deposits be na exhausted for 200 years.&quot;The above estimate was doubtless based upon surveys carried out prior to or early in 1913, and possibly upon the older methods of extraction which only resulted in the recovery of about 50 per cent, of the nitrate in the material treated. The introduction of improved methods of extraction and treatment, to which reference is made, has been accelerated during the last few years in conseq\ience of the increasing demand for Chile nitrate, and it is considered by good authorities that further developments may eventually lead to the extraction of as much as 85 per cent, of the nitrate. Improvements of this character may add appreciably to the life of the deposits on the basis of the pre-war rate of production.On the other hand the statement quoted, unlike Sir William Crookes&apos; estimate prepared in 1898, does not take into account the normal growth in the world&apos;s demand, which approximately doubles eveiy ten years. Moreover, it omits all reference to the possibility of a still more rapidly increasing demand in the future. It is also important to note that the deposits are often far from uniform in composition and extend over very large areas in desert regions remote from the coast. In many cases, therefore, the cost of exploitation would be prohibitive on account of the cost of labour, fuel, and transport, which is continually advancing in Chile as elsewhere.The enormous expansion of the synthetic nitrogen industries occasioned by the war, and the low cost of production of some of the synthetic products, will undoubtedly result in very keen competition in the nitrogen market after the war,  An indication is given
later as to possible reductions in the selling price of Chile nitrate under stress of competition, but every reduction in price renders it less profitable to work inferior and more remotely situated deposits, and thus imposes an economic limitation upon the estimated life of the nitrate grounds.There is not much doubt, however, that the deposits in Chile are adequate to provide for all demands upon them for a century or more, but the duration of the period of profitable working will depend not only upon the magnitude of future demands and the rate at which the richer and more accessible deposits are exhausted, but also upon the economic factors just indicated.THE ECONOMICS OF THE NITRATE INDUSTRY.The Chile nitrate industry holds the premier position in the nitrogen market of the world, and it is of fundamental importance to have accurate figures as to the normal costs of production, in order to arrive at a reasonably safe estimate as to how far they can be reduced in the future in face of competition from synthetic products.The Sub-Committee has been supplied with a very exhaustive and authoritative statement concerning the Chilean nitrate industry, and upon it the figures set out below are based.Capital Cost of Nitrate Factory in Chile.&quot;The price at which nitrate property is offered for sale by the Chilean Government is based upon the amount of nitrate of soda upon the property, and an average purchase price amounts to 3d. per quintal. (22 Spanish quintals = 1 ton of 2,240 lb.)The pre-war capital cost of a medium sized modern nitrate factory with an average production of, say, 24,000 tons of Chile nitrate per annum, including the purchase of nitrate grounds having a life of about 20 years, would be as follows :Chile Nitrate (15 - 65 per cent. N.)Pci&apos; lomj   Per metric ton.Purchase of nitrate groundsFactory with all. necessary buildings and plant   -     -     -Loose plant including locomotives, cars,stores, etc. - - -Water and radway sidingsTotal -     -     -     - 125,000150,00025,000 25,000325,000For an annual output of 24,000 long tons of 95 per I cent, nitrate (15-65 per cent. N), the capital outlay thus amounts to  13&quot; 54 per ton of Chile nitrate per annum.Total Capital engaged in the Industry.In considering the total capital engaged in the nitrate industry, account must be taken of the expen-diture involved in shipping for placing the nitrate on the European market. The output of a factory of the size indicated above could be marketed by a steamer carrying 8,000 tons dead-weight and making three round voyages per annum. The pre-war cost of such a vessel would amount to  70,000, and if half the capital cost is assigned to home-bound nitrate and the other half to outward-bound cargo, the additional capital involved amounts to  1-46 per long ton of Chile nitrate per annum.The total capital therefore involved in nitrate plant and in shipping for marketing the produce in Europe, amounts to  15 per long ton of Chile nitrate per annum.Pre-war Cost of Production.Figures for the pre-war cost of production per ton of nitrate (95 per cent, purity, containing 15&apos;65 per cent N) are summarised below. They include an allowance for the amortization of the cost of the nitrate grounds and plant, and for interest at the rate of 5 per cent, on the capital cost of the plant.ton.   s. d.All factory expenses in Chile, including labour, fuel, repairs, sundries, bags and bagging, freight to port, shipping charges, and commission : 4s, per quintal 4  8  0Amortization of grounds, and depreciation and interest on plant : 1*. per&apos;quintal     -     -   1   2   0Sea freight 25s., and insurance 2s.

( 10-69) per long ton.During the war period, the selling price of Chile nitrate has increased substantially, having risen to  12 12s. lid. per long ton in 1915 and to  17 12s. 6d. in 1916.. The latter figure is equivalent to  17-34 per metric ton, or  110&apos; 87 per metric ton of combined nitrogen in the form of Chile nitrate.Possible post-war Reductions in Production Costs.It is important to estimate how far the market price of Chile nitrate could fall without loss to the producers in the event of keen competition arising in the nitrogen markets of the world. As previously mentioned, the introduction of improved methods may lead to a substantial reduction in the cost of extraction. It is believed that a reduction of about 25 per cent, may be effected in the average cost per quintal of nitrate of soda on the drying floor, thus diminishing the pre-war cost of 3s. to 2s. 3d., a saving of 9d. per quintal.On the other hand, there is little likelihood of a reduction in the cost of packing, labour, and fuel, and of transport to a port in Chile. The charges for labour and fuel are continually advancing, and it is improbable that they will fall to pre-war levels, especially when recourse has to be made to the inferior deposits in less accessible regions.The pre-war production costs include payments to the Chilean Government amounting to 3d. per quintal for the purchase of nitrate grounds, and to 2s. id. per quintal for export duty, making a total payment to the Government of  2 16s. 10c?. per ton of nitrate. It may be taken that, in the event of severe competition, the Chilean Government would reduce the export duty and property charges rather than lose the market, and a substantial reduction of the export duty to 10s. per ton of nitrate will be assumed.The question of freight is also a serious one, as will be seen from the previous figures, and although the position of the shipping industry is likely to remain abnormal for some years after the war, it will be assumed that the freight might be lowered to 20s. per ton of nitrate. The greatest possible reduction in the costs of production of Chile nitrate might therefore be as follows: Saving per long ton of Nitrate.Chilean duty reduced to 10s. per ton Cost of extraction reduced by 9d. per quintal      -     -     -.     - .; ..-t Freight reduced to 20s. per tonTotal  20 10 0  5   03   2 10 P 2
nitrate proudots committee : final report.The cost oi Chile nitrate on shore in England or On the Continent might therefore be lowered to  7 Is., or, say,  7 per long ton, but this would represent no profit whatever for the producer, although it would provide for interest at the rate of 5 per&apos; cent, upon the capital involved in the nitrate plant in Chile.&quot; Lowest Possible &quot; Production Cost.From the foregoing considerations, it appears that a figure of  7 per long ton represents the &quot;lowest possible&quot; price at which Chile nitrate might be marketed in England or on the Continent in the future. This figure is equivalent to  44&apos;02 per metric ton of combined nitrogen in the form of Chile nitrate, and represents the &quot; possible &quot; competitive price that might have to be faced by the producers of synthetic and other forms of nitrogen compounds.It may be emphasised, however, that all the evidence points to the fact that the production costs under post-war conditions will be higher than under pre-war conditions, and definite opinions to that effecthave been expressed by competent authorities, The export duty is now heavier than formerly owing to the rate of exchange, and the costs of fuel and labour in Chile are increasing. Moreover, shipping freights are likely to remain higher under post-war conditions than they were prior to the war owing to abnormal demands upon a depleted mercantile marine. The counter-vailing factors are the probable reductions in cost due to more efficient methods of extraction, and the possi-bility of a reduction in the duty and property charges made by the Chilean Government. In spite of these factors, it is improbable, except in the case of very severe competition, that Chile nitrate will be marketed in Europe at a figure approaching the &quot; lowest possible &quot; price indicated above.The following table contains a summary and an extension of the figures previously given for the capital and production costs involved in the Chile nitrate industry.PRODUCTION AND MARKETING OF CHILE NITRATE (15-65 per cent.

It is unnecessary for present purposes to describe the various retort and condensing apparatus employed, but it may be mentioned that the strength of the sulphuric acid used depends upon the kind of nitric acid required, a concentrated sulphuric acid of about 160o Tw. being necessary for making strong nitric acid, whereas ordinary Glover tower sulphuric acid of about 140o Tw. suffices1 for the production of weak nitric acid. Both weak and strong nitric acids are made for industrial purposes and for munitions.The figures given below relative to the pre-war-costs involved in the^ production of concentrated nitric acid from Chile nitrate are based upon manufacturing experience in this country.Capital Cost of Nitric Acid Factory.The pre-war capital cost of a full-scale retort plant for manufacturing concentrated (90 per cent.) nitric acid from Chile nitrate amounts to  2 per long ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) per annum.With regard to the sulphuric acid section of the factory, the capital cost amounts to  2 - 5 per long ton of rectified sulphuric acid per annum. As 1-7 tons of sulphuric acid are required for the manufacture of one ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) in the form of concentrated (90 per cent.) acid, the capital - outlay for the sulphuric acid section will amount to 1-7 x  2 - 5     4 - 25 per long ton of HN03 per annum.The total capital cost of a complete nitric acid factory is therefore  6-25 per long ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) per annum.Production Costs.The pre-war production costs, with details con-cerning the quantities of materials required for the
manufacture of one ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) in the form of 90 per cent, acid, are as follows, allowing a yield of about 90 per cent, on the combined nitrogen employed :II NOj (calculated as 100 per cent.) per long ton.  1 -58 tons ot Chile nitrate at  10&apos;5 per&apos; ton.......16-5901-70 tons of rectified sulphuric acid at  3 per ton......5-100-1 cwt. fuel at 7.?. 6tl. per ton -     -     -    0-075Labour,   repairs,   general   expenses, depreciation, and interest -     -     -    1-925Total      -     -     -     -  23-690On the basis of the &quot; lowest possible &quot; cost of Chile nitrate previously quoted, namely,  7 per long ton, the production costs would become  18 -16 per ton of hno3 (calculated as 100 per cent.) in the form of 90 per cent. acid.Observations.The figure of  23 - 69 is on the safe side, and it is certain that the total cost of the sulphuric acid used could be reduced by about  1. Allowing for this reduction, the production costs in the cases under consideration become  22 -69 and  17-16 respectively per ton of HN03, and the former figure has been adopted by the Sub-Committee.Excluding losses of combined nitrogen, which may ba taken at approximately 10 per cent., the actual cost of converting Chile nitrate into concentrated (90 per cent.) nitric acid thus amounts to  6*1 per long ton of UNO;) (calculated as 100 per cent.).As indicated previously, the manufacture of weaker nitric acid can be effected by means of Glover tower sulphuric acid, and the production and conversion costs in that case would be reduced accordingly.According to information supplied by the Explosives Department, the cost of making strong nitric acid under war conditions in this country amounted to about  30 per ton early in 191.7 and has since increased to about  35 per ton.The pre-war selling price of nitric acid varied some-what in different parts of the country, and in conse-quence it is only possible to give approximate figures. According to information collected by the Sub-Com-mittee, it may be taken that the average price during 1911-13 free on rail at the makers&apos; works amounted to about  14 to  15 per long ton in the case of acid of 65 per cent, strength (sp. gr. 1 - 40), and to about  23 per ton in the case of concentrated acid of 94 per cent, strength (sp. gr. 1-50). The equivalent prices per long ton of HNO;t (calculated as 100 per cent.) thus amounted to from  21 - 54 to  23 - 07 in the case of dilute acid and to  24 - 47 in the case of concentrated acid.The following table contains a summary and an extension of the figures previously given for the capital and production costs involved in the nitric acid industry:MANUFACTURE OF CONCENTRATED NITRIC ACID (90 per cent.).Capital Costs.

SECTION II.BY-PRODUCT AMMONIA AND AMMONIUM SULPHATE MANUFACTURE.The combined nitrogen contained -in coal, shale, and other matter of organic origin constitutes the world&apos;s great natural source of ammonia and ammo-mum sulphate. By far the largest proportion of the ammonia nitrogen obtained in commercial operations is recovered as a by-product in the destructive distil-lation of coal and shale. Although the percentage of combined nitrogen in these substances is small, varying, from 0-5 to 2 per cent., and only a proportion of this is eventually recovered as ammonia, the total output of the latter is very large in this and other countries on account of the enormous scale on which the industries concerned are carried on.The various processes employed for recovering ammonia in the form of ammoniacal liquor or ammo-mum sidphate are referred to later; it will suffice at this stage to mention that the main industries con-cerned in ammonia recovery in this country are those engaged in the manufacture of illuminating gas, and of metallurgical coke, in the distillation of shale, in the production of power gas, and in the manufacture of pig-iron with raw coal.The ever-increasing demand for ammonium sulphate for agricultural purposes, and the steady rise in its market price over a period of years, have stimulated the more extensive adoption of recovery plant in industries in which ammonia nitrogen was previously allowed to go to waste. Having regard to the extent to which the economic position of many of these industries depends upon the revenue obtained from the sale of ammonium sulphate, the latter has tended to assume the position of a principal product and the term by-product no longer has the significance it possessed in the early days of the industries.The world&apos;s production of ammonium sulphate has increased by approximately 130 per cent, during the last ten years, and amounted to over 1,400,000 tons in 1913. Charts illustrating the expansion of the world&apos;s production and the increase in the British production of ammonia nitrogen during the last ten years, and the corresponding market prices of ammonium sulphate in this country, appear at the end of the Appendix. (Charts C, D., and E.)PRE WAR MARKET PRICES.The market price of ammonia nitrogen depends upon the precise form in which it is placed on the market. The more important forms in which by-product ammonia is utilised commercially are as follows: Crude gasworks liquor (i.e., 8 to 10 oz, liquor equivalent to 1&apos; 73 to 2&apos; 17 per cent. NH3); con-centrated gas liquor containing 15 to 20 per cent, of NH3; pure ammonia liquor or spirit containing from 20 per cent, to 35-6 per cent. (sp. gr. = 0-880) NH3; anhydrous liquid ammonia; and ammonium sulphate. The figures given below deal with the corresponding market prices of ammonia nitrogen on the basis of long tons, and are followed by a table which indicates the equivalent values per metric ton of ammonia and of combined nitrogen. The capital and production costs involved in the manufacture of the various products are dealt with later.(1) Crude gasworks liquor of 8 oz. strength con-taining 1 - 73 per cent. NH3 could be purchased prior to the war for about 14 s. per ton delivered, corres-ponding to  40 - 46 per ton of actual NH3 in the form of 8 oz. liquor. v(2) Concentrated gas liquor containing, say, 14 to 17 per cent NH3 could be purchased during 1911-13 for an average price of about 9s. 3d. per unit (1 per cent. NH3)per ton delivered, corresponding to, say,  7-4 per ton of 16 per cent, liquor, or  46-25 per ton of actual NHj in the form of 16 per cent, liquor.(3) Pure ammonia spirit (20 to 25 per cent. NH3) could be purchased under pre-war conditions for anaverage price of about 10s. 3d. per unit per ton at the maker&apos;s works, corresponding to  12 -81 per ton of spirit (25 per cent. NH3), or  51 - 25 per ton of actual NH3 in the form of pure spirit.(4) Anhydrous liquid ammonia was worth about Is. per lb. prior to the war, or about  112 per ton.(5) The pre-war market price of ammonium sulphate in this country (average 1911-13) was  13 16s. 8d. ( 13&apos; 83) per ton calculated upon a content of 25 per cent. NH3 (nominally 24 per cent.), equivalent to  13-61 per metric ton,  54-44 per metric ton of ammonia in the form of ammonium sulphate (25 per cent. NH3), or  66&apos;10 per metric ton of combined nitrogen in the same form.The selling price of ammonium sulphate has fluc-tuated considerably in this country during the war period, varying from  14-4 per ton in 1915 to  17&apos;23 per ton in the early months of 1916. In the latter part of 1916 the price was fixed by a Government Committee at  15 and subsequently at  15 - 5 per ton at the works, and early in 1917 the price was fixed at  15-5 per ton at the works and at  16 delivered. The last-mentioned figure is equivalent to  64 per long ton of ammonia in the form of sulphate (25 per cent. NH3),  62-98 per metric ton, or  76-45 per metric ton of combined nitrogen in the same form.The lowest recorded price of ammonium sulphate in this country (in 1897) was  7 - 5 per long ton, equiva-lent to  7 - 38 per metric ton or  35&apos; 84 per metric ton of-combined nitrogen in the form of sulphate (25 per cent. NH3j.By far the largest proportion of the ammonia nitrogen produced in this country is fixed in the form of ammonium sulphate. The market price of sulphate has hitherto been based upon a quality termed &quot; grey &quot; containing 24 per cent. NH3, but the custom of the trade is to supply a product containing 24 - 5 per cent. NH3 while a standard of 25 per cent. NH3 appears to be coming into vogue.The usual method of arriving at the market price of ammonia in the form of crude liquor is to make certain deductions from the market price of sulphate f.o.b. an English port. These deductions are as follows: 3-5 per cent, of the price of sulphate, representing brokerage and commission for marketing, and a further sum of the order of  3 per ton of sulphate, representing the pre-war cost of converting ammonia into sulphate inclusive of the cost of acid, labour, packages, and so on. In the case of sulphate containing 25 per cent. NH3, the balance after these deductions have been made repi-esents the market price of 25 units of ammonia (0 - 25 ton) in the form of crude lkmor.Applying the above method to pre-war market prices of sulphate assumed to contain 25 per cent. NH3, the following figures are obtained:(a) With sulphate at the pre-war (average 1911-13)price of  13-83 per ton, the market price of 0-25 ton NH3 in the form of crude liquor would be  10-35, equivalent to  41-4 per ton of ammonia.(b) With sulphate at the lowest known market price in this country (in 1897), namely,  7-5 per ton, the market price of 0-25 ton of NH3 in the form of crude liquor would be  4-24, equivalent to  16-96 per ton of ammonia.-In consequence of the abnormal price of sulphuric acid and of the cost of labour and fuel under war conditions, the method of deduction referred to above cannot be relied upon to give a fair indication of the market price of crude ammonia liquor as such during the war period,

NH3) represented an addition of the order of  10 to  11 to the market price of ammonia in the form of crude liquor.THE ECONOMICS OP AMMONIA RECOVERY.The cost of recovering ammonia during the car-bonisation or gasification of coal, and of converting it into ammonium sulphate, will vary according to the particular industry selected and with the type of recovery process adopted.A broad distinction may be drawn between those industries, such as the illuminating gas industry, in which crude ammonia liquor is recovered by water absorption, and those in which the ammonia contained in gas is fixed directly, in the form of sulphate by means of semi-direct or direct recovery processes.Consideration will first be given to the economics of ammonia liquor recovery and the concentration and purification of the liquor. The figures given below for capital and production costs relate, for the most part, to long tons, and are followed by a table whioh indi-cates the equivalent values per metric ton of ammonia and of combined nitrogen.COST OP RECOVERING, CONCENTRATING AND PURIFYING.Recovery of Ammonia at Gasworks.The removal of ammonia and other products from illuminating gas is compulsory, and up to the point of running the crude ammonia liquor into wells, it may be taken that the only cost incurred is that required to maintain the purity of the gas as de-manded by statute,,this cost being debited to the gas.The recovery of ammonia at gasworks represents a definite capital outlay and definite working ex-penses. The Sub-Committee has been authoritatively informed that these charges are only a small fraction of the total charges involved at a large gasworks, and it seems probable that the working expenses con-nected with the scrubber plant do not amount to more than a few shillings per ton of crude liquor obtained.Concentrated Gas Liquor from Crude Gasworks Liquor.The figui*es given below have been supplied to the Sub-Committee from an authoritative source.Capital Cost. The pre-war capital cost of a plant for dealing with, say, 40,000 tons of ordinary gasworks liquor (2 per cent. NH3) per annum, and producing a concentrated gas liquor containing 16 per cent. NH3 is stated to be  8,000, or, say,  10 per ton of actualNHj (in the form of 16 per cent, liquor) produced per annum.Production Costs. The corresponding cost of con-centration is given as  5-3 per ton of actual NHS in the form of 16 per cent, liquor, and it is stated that the average loss of ammonia during the process is less than Pper cent.According to another authority the cost of pro-ducing ammonia of 25 per cent, concentration from gasworks liquor amounted, under war conditions in 1916, to  6 per ton of actual NH3, and the loss of ammonia during the process is placed at about 5 per cent.Pure Ammonia Spirit (25 per cent. NH3) from Crude Gasworks Liquor.The figures given below are taken from an estimate for a plant to be installed in proximity to a large gasworks whereby the provision of separate storage wells for the crude liquor is rendered unnecessary.Capital Cost. The pre-war capital cost of a plant for producing, say, 1,000 tons per annum of actual NH3 in the form of pure ammonia spirit (25 per cent. NH3) from ordinary gasworks liquor (2-17 per cent. NH3), including storage for about a week&apos;s output, but exclusive of storage for the crude liquor, is given as follows:Actual NH3 per ton per annum.Buildings anil foundations Complete ammonia plant Storage tanks Boiler installationTotal - 2-50- 6-60- 0-40- 2-87- 12-37Production Costs. The corresponding cost of pro-duction, inclusive of depreciation at the rate of 5 per cent., but exclusive of interest and of the cost of the gasworks liquor, is given as  7 - 81 per ton of actual NH3.The figure given above is also exclusive of any allowance for losses of ammonia, and the estimate provides for the purchase of sufficient liquor to cover a loss of 18 per cent, during transport and handling.Pure Ammonia Gas from Crude Gasworks Liquor.11 The estimate previously referred to also deals with the production of pure ammonia gas, and the following figures relating to a plant of corresponding capacity are taken from it.Capital Cost. The installation in this case com-prises compressors and storage reservoirs, part of the output being stored in the liquefied form, and the pre-war capital cost is given as  14 - 97 per ton of actual NH3 produced per annum.
Production Costs. The corresponding cost of pro-duction, inclusive of depreciation at the rate of 5 per cent, but exclusive of interest and of the cost of the gas-works liquor, is given as  7- 94 per ton of actual N H3. This figure is exclusive of any allowance for losses of ammonia, as in the preceding case.Pure Ammonia Gas from Concentrated Ammonia Water (17 to 20 per cent. NHS).The following figures are given in a foreign estimate for the cost-of producing a pure dry ammonia gas from ammonia water containing from 17 per cent, to 20 per cent, of ammonia. The costs are based upon the prices prevailing abroad dui&apos;ing the war period.Capital Cost. The -capital cost of a plant for pro-ducing over 3,000 metric tons of actual NH3 per annum from concentrated ammonia water (20 per cent. NH3) is given as follows:Actual NH3per metric ton per annum,equivalent to  10&apos;51 per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum.Production Costs. The production costs, exclusive of the cost of the concentrated ammonia water, are given as follows:Actual Nfl8 per metric ton.Cost of purification of ammonia water Cost of producing gas from purifiedproduct ......Amortization, at 10 per cent.Total   -1-7997 084-84Storage tank3 for ammonia water Distillation and condensing- plant complete with buildings Boiler Installation     ...

The estimate states that the probable cost of the plant in this country under war conditions would be about  8-66 per metric ton of actual ammonia per&apos;annumequivalent to  5-87 per metric ton of combined nitrogen in the form of pure ammonia gas. Allowing for amortization on the &quot; probable &quot; cost of the plant in this country under war conditions, the production cost becomes  4-62 per metric ton of ammonia, or  5-61 per metric ton of combined nitrogen in the form of pure ammonia gas. The above figures are exclusive of any allowance for interest on capital or for any losses that may occur in the working up of the ammonia water. Internal evidence in the estimate points to the occurrence of a loss of ammonia amounting to at least 4 per cent.Anhydrous Liquid Ammonia from Crude Gasworks Liquor.Reliable figures relating to this industry have not been made available to the Sub-Committee.The following table contains a summary and an extension of the figures just giTen for the costs involved in concentrating and purifying crude ammonia liquor.CONCENTRATION AND PURIFICATION OF AMMONIA LIQUOR.Summary of Evidence.

BY-PRODTJCT AMMONIA FOR THE AMMONIA OXIDATION PROCESS.The oxidation of by-product ammonia to form nitric acid is dealt with in detail in Section VII., but it is important at the present stage to arrive at a conclusion as to the probable costs involved in the production from by-product ammonia of a gas sufficiently pure for the oxidation process. Definite evidence is not available as to the degree of impurity that can be tolerated when platinum catalysts are employed. It appears, however, from the research work carried out under the direction of the Experi-ments Sub-Committee that ammonia of a purity such as is attained in the commercial manufacture of pure ammonia spirit can be successfully used.It may be taken, therefore, that the cost of pro-ducing a pure gas suitable for oxidation by platinum catalysts would be substantially the same as that of making pure ammonia spirit (25 per cent. NH3), and the tables previously given summarise the available evidence bearing on the question.&apos;Probable Capital Costs.From the figures it appears that the pre-war capital cost of a large-scale installation for producing, say, 3,000 metric tons of pure ammonia gas per annum from a concentrated liquor, including the provision of storage tanks and gas-holders, might amount to about  8 per metric ton of ammonia or  9&apos;71 per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum. This figure is of an approximate character only, but has been adopted pro-visionally by the Sub-Committee.On the other hand the pre-war capital cost of an installation of similar capacity for dealing with crude gasworks liquor might amount to about  12 per metric ton of ammonia or  14&apos;57 per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum, and this figure has also been tentatively adopted.-According to information which was supplied by the Explosives Department, the capital costs of certain typical plants erected under war conditions for the production of concentrated liquor (25 per cent. NH3) from weak ammonia liquors (1 to 2 per cent. NH3) have varied, in the case of entirely new plants, from  7 to  10 per ton of actual NH3 per annum. The annual contract capacities are from 2,500 to 6,000 tons of concentrated liquor (25 per cent. NIL,). It appears . that the plants are not intended to produce ammonia of a specially high degree of purity, and a certain tolerance is allowed as regards the presence of im-purities such as sulphuretted hydrogen, carbonic acid, cyanides and pyridine. In one case, however, the plant is designed to eliminate sulphuretted hydrogen and carbonic acid completely.A consideration of the figures previously given in the light of the above evidence appears to indicate somewhat lower pre-war capital costs than those pro-visionally adopted by the Sub-Oommittee.Probable Production Costs.A comparison of the various costs of conversion with the corresponding pre-war market prices of the products appears to show that the working costs of a large-scale plant for producing pure ammonia from concentrated liquor might be of the order of  4 per metric ton of actual NH3, or  4&apos;85 per metric ton of combined nitrogen.In the case, however, of a plant for producing pure ammonia from crude gasworks liquor, the working costs appear to be of the order of  7 per metric ton of actual NH3, or  8&apos;5 per metric ton of combined nitrogen.These figures have been provisionally adopted by the Sub-Committee and have been taken as inclusive of all working expenses and of amortization, but as ex-clusive of any allowance for losses of ammonia or for interest on capital.Losses of Ammonia during Purification.The figures quoted by different authorities in respect of the loss of ammonia during concentration and purification show considerable variation. In one case, the loss during the production of concentrated liquor (25 per cent. NII3) from gas liquor by a process involving a single distillation is placed at 5 per cent. According to another authority, however, the loss during the production of concentrated liquor (16 per cent. NH;i) from gasworks liquor is less than 1 per cent., and it is estimated that the further loss in pro-ceeding to the stage of pure spirit (25 per cent. NH3) should not exceed 0&apos; 5 per cent. In other &quot;statements losses of the order of 10 per cent, to 18 per cent, are&apos; quoted in connection with plants of small or moderate capacity.The Sub-Committee is of the opinion that with the best modern plant and efficient management, the loss of ammonia in the production of pure ammonia gas from ammoniacal liquors should not exceed 5 per cent. This figure has been adopted as a reasonable manu-facturing standard, and.is utilised in later sections (Sections VII. and VIII.) in dealing with the cost of making nitric acid and nitrates by the ammonia oxida-tion process.Value of By-product Ammonia.In dealing with the oxidation of by-product am-monia and the manufacture of ammonium nitrate, figures derived from the pre-war market prices of am-ammonium sulphate by the method previously indicated in page 226, have been adopted for the market price of ammonia in the form of crude liquor.An allowance of  7 per metric ton of actual NH3 has been added to represent the cost of converting the crude liquor into a pure ammonia spirit, and an allow-ance of  10 per metric ton of actual NH3 to represent the ma7&apos;ket price of ammonia in the form of pure spirit.Upon the basis of the figures previously deduced from the market prices of ammonium sulphate, the market pi-ice of a metric ton of ammonia in the form of pure spirit would thus amount to  50&apos; 74 (pre-war) and  26 &quot;69&apos; (lowest known), equivalent respectively to  61&quot; 59 and  32&apos; 40 per metric ton of combined nitrogen.MANUFACTURE OF AMMONIUM SULPHATE FROM BY-PRODUCTAMMONIA.The manufacture of sulphate at. the larger gas-works involves the working up of largo quantities of weak ammonia, liquor by prolonged boiling in order to drive off and dissociate the volatile ammonium salts, the ammonia gas being absorbed in sulphuric acid. The liquor also contains a variable percentage of &quot; fixed &quot; ammonia, and this is set free by the addition of lime. &quot;Where the production of sulphate is aimed at, the apparatus is so contrived that the &quot; volatile &quot; ammonia is expelled by heat nlone before the lime is added to decompose the fixed salts.The absorption of the ammonia may be carried out in such a way as to yield a solution of ammoniumsulphate, which is subsequently evaporated to produce a solid salt, or under such conditions that solid am-ammonium sulphate is produced directly, the heat evolved during the absorption in acid being sufficient to evaporate the water from the sulphuric acid.The average yield of ammonium sulphate at gas-works has been placed at 25 to 28 lb. per ton of coal carbonised.The capital and operating costs involved in dealing with very large quantities of weak ammonia liquor are appreciable. The costs are reduced, however, in the case of the semi-direct and direct recovery processes used for fixing the ammonia contained in coke-oven
gas, producer&quot; gas, blast furnace gas, and the like, as the gases themselves are washed with or passed directly into the acid.The economics of the manufacture of ammonium sulphate from gas liquor, and of the extraction of ammonia from gase3 are dealt with separately below.SULPHATE FROM GASWORKS LIQUOR.The cost of manufacture will vary appreciably with the conditions under which it is carried out. &quot;At a large gasworks, for example, the sulphuric acid re-quired for fixing the ammonia may be manufactured in situ, while in other cases it may have to be pur-chased, with consequent charges for transport. On the other hand, the liquor itself may be sold to a sulphate works which may possess its own sulphuric acid plant or, as before, may have to purchase the acid.It is unnecessary to deal with the economics of small-scale plant; an indication will be given, based upon authoritative figures, of the pre-war costs involved in the manufacture of sulphate on a large scale from crude ammonia liquor at a self-contained works making its own sulphuric acid, but purchasing the crude liquor.-Capital Costs.The capital cost of the sulphuric acid plant amounts to about  1 &quot;75 per long ton of 70 per cent, acid per annum.The capital cost of the plant for working up the crude gasworks liquor and fixing the ammonia as sulphate amounts to about  4-5 per long ton of sulphate per annum.According to the statement supplied, about 1-1 tons of acid are required per&apos; ton of &quot;&quot;sulphate produced. The capital cost of the complete works per ton of sulphate (25 per cent. NH3) per annum would thus amount to  1-92 for the acid section and  4&apos;5 for the ammonia and sulphate section, or. 6 -42 in all. This if equivalent to  6 -32 per metric ton of sulphate per annum,  25-27 per metric ton of ammonia per annum in the form of sulphate (25 per cent. NH3), or  30-67 per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum in the same form,-...,./. -..y: V : /      &apos; &apos;. V,..&apos;.;Production Costs.The cost of making the sulphuric acid may be placed at  1 per long ton, inclusive of all chai-ges in respect of labour, materials, repairs, maintenance of the plant, and interest on capital.The cost of working up the gas liquor and fixing the ammonia (exclusive of any losses during the operation) may be summarised as follows :Sulphate per long ton.Materials: 1-1 tons of 70 per cent, sul-phuric acid at  1-     -     -     1-10 1-3 tons of fuel at la. 6d.     -     0 49 0&quot;3 yards of lime at 10.*.      -     0-15 Manufacturing costs,  including  labour, repairs, maintenance, general charges, and interest at 5 per cent.    -     -     -     1 -35Total    -     -     -     -     3/09In the case of a sulphate containing 25 per cent, of ammonia, the above production costs are equivalent to  3 - 04 per metric t,on of sulphate, or  14 - 76 per metric ton of combined nitrogen in the form of sulphate.The figures do not include the cost of the crude gas liquor, and the quantity required per ton of sulphate manufactured, allowing for a loss of, say, 2 per cent, of the ammonia during the wholevprocess, would amount to about 14-7 tons of 8-oz. liquor (1 - 73 per cent. NIL,).AMMONIA FROM COKE OVEN GASES.The semi-direct and direct sulphate processes used in connection with coke-oven and gas producer plantavoid the treatment of the large quantities of liquid involved in water absorption, and the capital and operating costs are consequently reduced. Details concerning the cost of recovering ammonium sulphate by such processes have not been collected by tho Sub-Committee.The following figures, however, have been put forward (Journal of the Society of Ghemical Industry, February 15th, 1913) as illustrating the comparative capital and working costs under pre-war conditions of indirect, semi-direct, and direct ammonia recovery plants, without benzol recovery, for coke-oven installa-tions carbonising 500 tons of coal (10 per cent, moisture) per day.Costs,&apos;	Indirect, i.e., Water absorp-tion.

Other authorities, however, place the average yield at 22 to 24 lb.,,,,,, SULPHATE RECOVERY WITHOUT SULPHURIC ACID.With a view to avoiding the direct use of sulphuric acid for the recovery of by-product ammonia, processes have been devised whereby the sulphur contained in coal gas and coke-oven gases is utilised for the formation of sulphate.It is unnecessary to give a detailed description of the processes in question, but reference may be made to the polythionate process devised by Feld, and to the bisulphite process devised by Burkheiser. (Lunge, Coal Tar and Ammonia, 1916, Part 3, pp. 1196-1200.)Developments of this character may lead to economies in the fixing of ammonia,&apos; as compared with present methods, but no information is available as to the costs involved in operating the newer sulphate processes.EVIDENCE ON COST OF FIXING PURE STRONG AMMONIA.It is necessary at this stage to consider the probable costs involved in fixing a pure strong ammonia in view of their important bearing upon-the manufacture of ammonium sulphate from synthetic ammonia. The employment of a pure or practically pure ammonia obtainable in the form of gas, concentrated spirit, or anhydrous liquid, offers considerable attractions in the manufacture of ammonium sulphate as will be appre-ciated from previous remarks. In addition to the fact that little or no evaporation is required, it is also possible to utilise a weaker form of sulphuric acid for fixing the ammonia, namely, chamber acid (62 -5 per cent. H2S04) of 10Co Tw.The cost of synthetic ammonia and of ammonium sulphate made therefrom is set out in detail in Sec-tions TV. and VI. The present figures deal only with the costs involved in fixing a pure strong ammonia on a moderate and on a large scale, and are taken from foreign estimates dealing with the cost of making synthetic ammonium sulphate.Sulphate from Cyanamide Ammonia.The following figures, based upon pre-war conditions, are quoted in a foreign estimate for a large scale sul-phate factory having an output of over 50,000 tons
of sulphate per annum. The sulphuric acid is manu-factured in situ, and the ammonia is obtained from cyanamide.Capital Costs. The capital cost of plant including buildings for manufacturing sulphuric acid (sp. gr, - 1153) is given as  2&apos; 08 per metric ton of acid per annum.The capital cost of the sulphate section, including plant for the production of ammonia from cyanamide and also buildings, is given as  1&apos; 26 per metric ton of sulphate (2012 per cent. N s: 24-52 per cent. NH3) per annum.According to the estimate about 1 - 02 tons of acid are required per ton of sulphate produced, so that the overall cost of the factory is as follows :Sulphate (.20-2 per cent. N) per metric ton per annum. Sulphuric acid section : 1-02 at  2-08 - 2-12 Sulphate section.....1-26Total 3-38equivalent to  16-73 per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum in the form of sulphate (20-2 per cent. N).Production Costs. The cost of manufacturing the sulphuric acid, exclusive of interest on capital, is stated to amount to  0-973 per metric ton of chamber acid.The cost of converting the cyanamide into ammonia and of fixing the latter as sulphate, inclusive of packing but exclusive of interest on capital, is given as follows:Sulphate (20-2 per cent. N) per metric ton. Sulphuric acid at  0-973 per ton -     - 0-997Coal at   1 -12 per ton -     -     -     - 0-440Sundry materials and power -     -     - 0-026Wages at  0-253 per shift   -     -     - 0-104General charges..... 0-130Repairs and depreciation     -     -     - 0-251Bags and packing..... 0-281Total     -  2-229equivalent to about  11 - 03 per metric ton of combined nitrogen in the form of sulphate. The allowance for depreciation in the above figures amounts to 4 per cent, on buildings and 10 per cent, on plant.The requirements of the cyanamide conversion section of the sulphate plant will account for the items for fuel, sundry materials and power, and for a proportion of the items for wages, general charges, repairs and depreciation. It seems probable, therefore, that the actual cost of fixing the ammonia, inclusive of the cost of acid and of packing the sulphate, is of the order of  1 - 5 per metric ton of sulphate (20 - 2 per cent. N), on the basis of the figures given in the above estimate.Sulphate from Haber Ammonia.The following figures have been quoted as the cost of ammonium sulphate plant installed in connection with plant for producing synthetic ammonia by the Haber process.Capital Costs. According to one statement the costs of two sulphate factories, exclusive of ammonia producing and sulphuric acid sections, appear to have been about  1 - 45 and  1 - 65 respectively per metric ton of sulphate per annum, the output in the latter case amounting &quot;to over 30,000 tons per annum.   Theestimate for another installation, which was intended to have an output of over 50,000 tons of sulphate per annum indicates that the cost of the sulphate section was about  2 - 78 per metric ton of sulphate per annum. This figure probably includes the cost of sulphuric acid plant.Production Costs. The evidence referred to above do-as not indicate clearly the costs of conversion into sulphate.According to other information, however, based upon statements attributed to the Badische Co., the cost of producing a metric ton of combined nitrogen in the form of ammoniacal liquor amounts to  25-75, and the cost price of ammonium sulphate to  6 per metric ton. The latter figure covers all the costs of production,&apos; including depreciation at 5 per cent, on buildings and 10 per cent, on plant, and sulphuric acid of 60o (? Be) at  1 per metric ton.On the basis of a sulphate containing 25 per cent. NH3, the cost of conversion as indicated by these figures would amount to about  0&apos;7 per ton of sul-phate or less than the cost of the acid used. It is possible, however, that the cost of the ammonia war over-stated.Probable Cost of Fixing pure strong Ammonia.From a consideration of the various figures relating to the manufacture of ammonium sulphate, the Sub-Oommittee has arrived at the following conclusions.Capital Costs. It seems probable that the capital cost, under pre-war conditions in this country, of a large scale factory for fixing a pure strong ammonia and making the necessary sulphuric acid in situ will amount to about  3 per long ton of sulphate (24-5 per cent. NH3) per annum. This is equivalent to  2-95 per metric ton of sulphate per annum, or  14 &quot;63 per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum in the form of sulphate (24-5 per cent. NH3).Production Costs. &quot;With regard to the cost of fixing the ammonia, the cost of the chamber acid under pre-war conditions may be taken at  1 per long ton, inclusive of all working expenses and of depreciation in respect of the acid plant.The cost of conversion into sulphate containing, say, 24 - 5 per cent, of ammonia would probably be as follows under pre-war conditions, exclusive of interest on the conversion plant :Sulphate (24-5 per cent. NH3) per long ton.			 Sulphuric acid, 1-15 tons at  1	per ton	1	150Labour, repairs, expenses, and	depre-		ciation    ....		0	SOUBags, 10 at &apos;id.   -	-	0	125Total	- .   -	1	775equivalent to  1-746 per metric ton of sulphate, or  8-65 per metric ton of combined nitrogen in the form of sulphate.If an allowance is made for interest at the rate of 5 per cent, on the capital cost of the factory, the con-version cost per long ton of sulphate becomes  1 - 925, equivalent to  1-894 per metric ton, or  9-38&apos; per metric toil of combined nitrogen in the form of sulphateThe cost of the sulphuric acid is the principal item in the cost of fixing, and efforts have therefore been made to introduce processes which avoid the direct , use of sulphuric acid. This point is referred to in Section IV. in connection with the manufacture of synthetic ammonium sulphate by the Haber process.
SECTION III.THE ARC PROCESS.The arc process for the manufacture of nitric acid and nitrates depends upon the fact that the direct union of atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen to form nitric oxide can be effected at the temperature of the electric arc, which is of the order of 30000 C.Nitric oxide dissociates rapidly at the temperas ture in question, but the product becomes practi-caliy stable if the temperature is reduced to about 12000 C. The passage of the air through the arc results in the production of from 4 to 5 per cent, by volume of nitric oxide; on account, however, of the influence of dissociation, and of the technical diffi-culties involved in effecting a rapid cooling of the arc gases, a concentration of from 1 to 2 per cent, only is obtained in commercial practice.Large-scale operations have been almost entirely confined to the three well-known types of furnace, namely, the Birkeland-Eyde, the Schonherr (which in modern Norwegian practice has been displaced by the former), and the Pauling. The development of the Moscicki furnace in Switzerland may also be noted. A good deal of information has been published concerning the technical details of the furnaces and the commercial working of the arc process (e.g., Norton, JT.S. Oon-sular Report. 1912, Utilisation of Atmospheric Nitro-gen), and it is unnecessary to recapitulate these matters. Authoritative information has been supplied to the Sub-Committee upon a number of aspects of the process, and this is dealt with later.THE BIRKELAND-EYDE PROCESS.The Birkeland-Eyde process has been developed on a very large scale in Norway since 1904, over 200,000 e.h.p. having been utilised in the industry up to about 1913, and an expansion to 500,000 e.h.p. being con-templated. The information given under the following sub-headings relates to the Birkeland-Eyde process and the. costs- are based upon the conditions prevailing in Norway prior to the war. Evidence concerning the Pauling and Moscicki processes is given later.Size of Furnaces and minimum economic Size of Installation.The modern developments of the arc process have been in the direction of the employment of large furnaces, and units having a capacity of 2,000 k.w., 3,000 k.w., and 4,000 k.w. are now in use. According to reliable information, a furnace of 2,000 k.w. capa-city is the smallest economical size, but furnaces of 3,000 k.w. capacity are preferable.It has also been stated that experience has shown that the curve of yield has gone up with increase in size of the Birkeland-Eyde furnaces. It may be pointed out that other advantages are gained by the use of large furnaces, both in connection with the question of labour and repairs, and also as regards the amount of heat recoverable from the furnace gases. The evidence available on the latter point is dealt with later. ,From the information supplied to the Sub-Com-mittee it appears that the minimum size of installa-tion for economy in manufacture is one adapted for a power supply of 15,000 to 20,000 k.w.Power Factor. vThe power factor of arc furnaces is low, probably of the order of 0 - 6 to 0- 7. According to an autho-ritative statement, a power factor of 0 - 7 is attained with furnaces of about 3,500 lew. capacity.Other information indicates that in recent develop-ments with furnaces of 4,000 k.w. capacity, the power factor has been raised to 0&apos;8 (Hosmer, Literature of the Nitrogen Industries, 1912-16, Reprint from theJournal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, April 1917, Vol. 9, No. 4).Auxiliary Plant.A good deal of auxiliary plant is required in con-nection with an arc furnace installation, its nature being determined to some extent by the character of the final products. As a general rule, the auxiliary plant comprises absorption towers, ventilators for blowing air through the furnaces, pumps for circulating the solutions in the absorbing towers, neutralizing tanks, evaporating appliances, and machinery for drying, crushing, grinding and packing solid products, such as lime nitrate.It has been clearly established by the evidence collected that from 5 to 7 per cent, of the total supply of energy is required for the auxiliary plant. In the case of a large scale installation, however, the steam raised by means of the sensible heat of the .furnace gases is sufficient to provide for all the-requirements in connection with evaporation and concentration, and also to develop enough power in steam turbo-electric plant to run all the auxiliary machinery.Utilisation of Waste Heat.From the electrothermal standpoint the arc process is extremely inefficient, only about 3 to 4 per cent, of the energy applied being expended in effecting the actual union of nitrogen and oxygen to form nitric oxide. A certain proportion of the energy is lost by radiation and conduction from the furnaces, and about 90 per cent, is represented by the sensible heat &quot;of the issuing gases.The gases issue from the large furnaces at a temperature of about l,200o O, and can be cooled to about 200o C. in passing through steam boilers and economisers. It has been stated that the oxides of nitrogen do not exert a corrosive action upon the boilers, etc, as long as the temperature of the gases is not allowed to fall below the latter value. The gases are&apos; further cooled to about 50o-60o C. by means of multi-tumilar aluminium coolers before passing to the oxidation chamber.A considerable amount of steam can be raised by means of the hot gases from large arc furnaces, and, in practice, from 0-8 to 0&apos;9 kg. of steam with 632 kilo-calories can be obtained per k.w.-hour applied. After all demands in connection with evaporation and concentration have been met, the remaining steam is sufficient, if used in steam turbo-electric plant, to restore about 5 per cent, of the applied energy to the system. As previously indicated, this is adequate for the requirements of sill the auxiliaries to the main arc plant. Alternatively, if none of the steam is used for evaporation or concentration, about 13 per cent, of the applied energy can be recovered by means of steam turbo-electric plant.It has been stated that the total consumption of water in a modern arc installation for steam raising, cooling and washing the gases, and the like, amounts to 1*5 gallons (0-006S cu. m.) per k.w.-hour. The bulk of the water is required for the subsidiary cooler, only a relatively small quantity being used in the absorption towers.Concentration of Nitric Oxitle in Furnace Gases.Although it has been stated that the concentration of nitric oxide in the gases issuing from Birkeland-Eyde furnaces amounts to about 2 per cent, by volume (Norton, pp. 51 and 72), a critical examination of all the evidence available upon this question leads to the conclusion that the concentration obtained in commercial practice is only of the order of 1-25 per
cent. Tins conclusion is corroborated by a statement recently published on good authority to the effect that the concentration is about 1 * 25 per cent. (Hosmer, previously quoted), and also by evidence from another source.Recovery Operations and Nature of Products.After the abstraction of the greater portion of their sensible heat, the furnace gases are passed into an oxidation chamber of large capacity where they remain for a sufficient time to ensure the conversion of the whole or a large proportion of the nitric oxide into nitrogen . peroxide. The gases are then forced to ascend a series of towers fed with dilute nitric acid or water in which the bulk of the nitrogen peroxide is absorbed with the formation of dilute nitric acid.The reactions which occur during the absorption have been studied by a number of investigators, and may be summarised by the following equations : .    2 NOj+HaO    HNOg+HNOj -     -    (i) 3 HN02      irz HNOj-fH20-f 2 NO -   (ii) or HNOss-f-NO^ HN0.+NO   -     -  (hi) The free nitrous acid formed according to. equation (i) is unstable under ordinary conditions and decom-poses in accordance with equation (ii), or is oxidised to nitric acid by an excess of nitrogen peroxide in accordance with equation (hi).  The nett result of the above reactions is given by the equation: 3 N02-fH20&apos;ss 2 HNO:,H- NO -     -  (iv) In the presence of an excess of air, the nitric oxide liberated in accordance with equations (ii), (iii) and (iv) is converted into nitrogen peroxide which passes through the same cycle of reactions.An important factor governing the recovery opera-tions and the cubical capacity to be allotted to the absorption towers is the time-element involved in the conversion of nitric oxide into nitrogen peroxide by the action of atmospheric oxygen and also in the reaction between nitrogen peroxide and water,In the case of a gaseous mixture containing 2 per cent, of nitric oxide, the conversion of 50 per cent, of the latter into nitrogen peroxide requires 12 seconds, while the conversion of 90 per cent, requires 100 seconds (Norton, p, 52). During the course of each absorp-tion cycle in accordance with equation (iv), three parts of nitrogen peroxide are removed from the gases and replaced by one part of nitric oxide. The concentra-tion of the latter thus diminishes rapidly during the recovery operations and the velocity of its conversion into nitrogen peroxide becomes correspondingly slower.On account of the increasing time-element, the dilute gases in the later stages of the operation contain unoxidised nitric oxide, and in the presence of an equi-molecular proportion of nitrogen peroxide absorp-tion takes place according to the equation: NO-fNO+HjO    rr 2 HN02 -     -   (v) or N02-fNO-f2NaOH^2NaN02-fH20  (vi) In practice, the last stages of the absorption are carried out with alkali, resulting in the production of a nitrite or a mixture of nitrate and nitrite according to the conditions of operation.The velocity of the absorption of nitrogen peroxide by water depends upon the concentration of peroxide in the gases and also upon the concentration of nitric acid in the solution, falling as the former decreases, and rapidly diminishing as the latter increases owing to the diminution in the active mass of free &apos;water. Moreover, the evaporation of the acid as its concen-tration increases is accelerated by the large excess of inert gases passed through the solution. These factors limit the maximum concentration of nitric acid obtainable at ordinary temperatures from gases con-taining a definite percentage of oxides of nitrogen.The above considerations make it apparent that in dealing with very large volumes of furnace gases con-taining a low initial concentration of nitric oxide, an absorption section of considerable dimensions is necessary if efficient recovery is to be effected.According to information supplied to theSub-Com-mittee it appears that the normal Norwegian practice is to pass about 2-l cu. m. (74 cu. ft.) of air through the furnaces per kilowatt per hour.  For a concen-tration of about 1 * 25 per cent, by volume of nitric oxide, the recovery of a metric ton of nitric iioid (calculated as 100 per cent.) thus necessitates the passage of over 1,000,000 cu. ft. of air through the furnaces and absorption towers. The towers employed in commercial operations of this order are of a very large * and costlycharacter. For example, a plant recently erected in France and having a capacity of about 6,000 to 7,000 tons of nitric acid (calculated as 100-per cent.) per annum, comprises four acid towers made of granite, each 80 ft. high and 18 ft. in diameter, and a fifth alkaline tower of sheet iron of similar dimensions.It is clearly established by the evidence available that about 85 per cent, of the combined nitrogen recovered from the furnace gases is absorbed as dilute acid, the remaining 15 per cent, being absorbed by an alkaline solution in the form of an alkaline nitrite or a mixture of nitrate and nitrite. If desired, this product can be treated with nitric acid and con-verted into practically pure nitrate, the nitrous fumes evolved during the reaction being returned to the absorption towers.The dilute nitric acid from the main towers con-tains some 30 per cent, by weight of nitric acid, and cau be concentrated to a strength of about 50 per cent, in evaporators heated by means of the furnace gases. The production of a concentrated nitric acid of 96 per cent, strength is a more difficult operation, and is commonly effected by distilling a mixture of nitric and strong sulphuiic acids, the latter being recovered and re-concentrated by means of the heat of the furnace gases. The concentration stage adds substantially to the capital and working costs, and this point is dealt with later.Instead of converting the dilute acid irto con-centrated acid, it can be employed for the manufacture of nitrates, such as ammonium nitrate and lime nitrate, In this case the dilute acid is neutralised directly with an appropriate base and the nikate solution evaporated to dryness by means of the heat of the furnace gases.Losses of Combined Nitrogen.It has been stated that from 2 to 2&apos; 5 per cent, of the combined nitrogen contained in the furnace gases escapes absorption and passes into the air from the last tower (Norton, p. 54).) On the other hand, authoritative evidence supplied to the Sub-Committee indicates that the overall loss of combined nitrogen, representing the difference between that originally contained in the furnace gases and that actually condensed and sold, may amount to approximately 9- 4 per cent.The loss of combined nitrogen during the working up of dilute nitric acid to the concentrated form (96 per cent.) amounts to about 3 per cent, in standard Norwegian practice.Yield or Output for Energy consumed.Many figures for the yield of Birkeland-Eyde furnaces have been quoted in technical publications, and a number of others have been supplied to the Sub-Committee from authoritative sources. These figures show considerable divergence, and caution is necessary iu attempting to arrive at a reasonably safe figure in view of the important bearing of the power require-ments upon the capital and production costs.Yields are usually expressed as kilogrammes of nitric acid per kilowatt-year, or as grammes pei kilowatt-hour, and having regard to the fact that the products obtained from an arc furnace plant consist not only of dilute or concentrated nitric acid but also of nitrates and nitrites, it has been taken that the figures for yield cover the total output of all products expressed in terms of 100 per cent, nitric acid or of x combined nitrogen.In many cases it is not clear whether the figures for yield are based upon &quot;the initial products only, namely, dilute nitric acid and nitrate-nitrite products, or whether they represent the &quot;final output of market-able products after all losses in working up have been allowed for. &apos; It may also be stated that a critical examination has revealed the unreliability of figures whiih are based upon data as to the amount of combined nitrogen in the furnace gases.
In dealing with the figures, it is necessary to keep in view the well-known difficulties involved in making accurate measurements of large quantities of energy. Moreover, the precise point at which the measurements are made also has a bearing on the question of yield, and it has been authoritatively stated that there may easily be a loss of energy amounting to 5 per cent, between the switchboard and the terminals of the furnace.The following figures for yield or for the power requirements of the arc process have been under review by the Sub-Committee.According to the statement of one witness a yield of 650 kg. HN03 per k.w.-year of 8,760 hours measured at the furnace terminals represents the best modern Norwegian practice. If an allowance is made for a loss of energy amounting to 5 per cent, between the switchboard and the furnace terminals, the above figure is equivalent to 617 kg. HNO;, per k.w,-year measured at the switchboard.The same witness stated that one of the Nor-wegian plants installed about 1914 was giving a yield of 620 kg. HN03 per k.w.-year. Yields of the same order, namely, 620 to 640 kg. HN03 per k.w.-year, have also been quoted in respect of a new plant established in Prance during the war period, but con-firmatory evidence based upoir the continued running of this plant has not been available.A figure from another source places the power requirements at about 12 e.h.p.-years, or 8 &quot;95 k.w.-years, per metric ton of nitrogen fixed.According to the evidence supplied by another authority the power requirements per metric ton of combined nitrogen amount to 11&apos;3 e.h.p.-years, or 8&apos;43 k.w.-years, in the case of a large-scale installa-tion producing dilute nitric acid (30 to 40 per cent.), and to 11&apos; 8 e.h.p.-years, or 8&apos;80 k.w.-years, in the case of concentrated acid.Information derived from another source indicates that about 130 e.h,p. without standby is required for the production of 1 ton of HN03 per week. For a year of 50 weeks this represents 130 e.h.p.-years per 50 tons of HN03, equivalent to 1&apos; 94 k.w.-years per ton of HN03, or 8&apos;73 k.w.-years per ton of com-bined nitrogen. It is not clear whether the quantities referred to in this statement are expressed in terms of long tons or of metric tons.The most authoritative figures obtained by the Sub-Committee in this connection specify an output, based upon the combined nitrogen actually con-densed and sold, equivalent to 515 kg. HN03 per k.w.-year of 8,500 hours measured at the switchboard. Assuming a loss of energy amounting to 5 per cent, between the switchboard and the furnace terminals in accordance with the information supplied by the same informant, the output would amount to 542 kg. HN03 per k.w.-year of 8,500 hours measured at the furnace terminals. On the basis of a k.w.-year of 8,760 hours, the above figures are equivalent to yields of 530 kg. HN03 and 558 kg. HN03 respectively. The informant admitted that, with care, the output for the energy consumed might be increased substantially above the figure quoted by him, and agreed that a yield of 620 kg. HN03 per k.w.-year might be correct for the new plant in France referred to above.The first witness responsible for the figure for the best modern Norwegian practice, in commenting upon the figures just given, stated that they applied to one of the older plants in Norway and not to the newer plants, which were giving higher yields of the order previously indicated.Recent authoritative information concerning an arc furnace installation below the minimum, economic size indicates an output of 513 kg. HN03 per k.w.-year based upon the total supply of energy to the installa-tion. The information indicates that 5 per cent, of the total energy is utilised for auxiliaries, and the output when calculated upon the furnace consumption alone amounts to 540 kg. HN03 per k.w.-year.The table in the next column contains a summary and extension of the figures given above.Observations and Conclusions on Yield.After a careful consideration of the above evidence and in view of the fact that the ar-c process is speciallyYIELD OR ENERGY CONSUMPTION OF ARC FURNACE PLANT.Summary of Evidence.

HN03 is 535 kg. HN03 per k.w.-year of 8,760 hours measured at the switchboard, and this figure has been adopted. It includes an allowance for losses during the absorption and concentration stages, and is equivalent to a consumption of energy amounting to 1 - 87 k.w.-years per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) produced, or to 8-41 k.w.-years per metric ton of nitrogen fixed.In view of the information given above, there are reasonable grounds for believing that the yield may be substantially higher for modern large-scale installa-tions. In consequence, alternative figures for costs are given on pp. 236 and 237, based upon an assumed yield of 600 kg. HN03 per k.w.-year of 8,760 hours measured at the switchboard, corresponding to a con-sumption of energy of 1-66 k.w.-years per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) produced, or to 7-5 k.w.-years per metric ton of nitrogen fixed.THE ECONOMICS OF NITRIC ACID MANUFACTURE.The chemical plant required for manufacturing nitric acid by the arc process is of an extensive and costly nature, and the lavish character of the lay-out of the Noiwegian plants is well known. It has been stated by a reliable authority that the costs under
British conditions would not be as high as they are in Norway.With regard to the manufacturing costs, the main items are in respect of the charges for the energy and for depreciation of the costly chemical plant, the other items involved in the production of dilute nitric acid being comparatively small. As will be seen later, however, the concentration of the dilute acid represents an appreciable extra charge.In considering the question of costs, it is convenient to deal separately with the different sections comprising a complete nitric acid factory, namely :Chemical installation for producing dilute acid ;Acid concentrating section ;Power station section. The capital and working costs are therefore set out under separate headings below.Capital Cost of Chemical Installation for Dilute Acid.The chemical section of a nitric acid factory, as distinct from the power section, comprises arc furnaces, steam boilers, coolers, absorption towers, evaporating plant and the like. The following figures for capital cost have been under review.According to one witness the cost of a large-scale plant for producing dilute nitric acid (30 to 40 per cent.) amounts to  86&apos; 1 per metric ton of com-bined nitrogen per annum, equivalent to  19&apos;13 per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) per annum in the form of dilute acid.Another statement which was supplied indicates a capital cost of  72,000 for a medium-sized installation capable of producing 260 tons of dilute (50 per cent.) nitric acid and 20 tons of sodium nitrite per week, i.e.,-32&apos; 95 tons of fixed nitrogen per week. On the basis of a year of 50 weeks, this is equivalent to a capital cost of  43&apos; 7 per ton of nitrogen fixed per annum, or  9&apos; 71 per ton of HNO;! (calculated as 100 per cent.) per annum in the form of dilute acid. It is not clear whether the quantities dealt with in this statement are expresseS in terms of long tons or metric tons, and there are reasons for believing that the costs are based upon British conditions and are on the low side.The most authoritative figure obtained by the Sub-Committee in this connection is expressed in terms of the electrical capacity of the arc furnace installation, and indicates that the capital cost of a large-scale plant for manufacturing dilute nitric acid would amount, under Norwegian conditions, to  61187 (110 kroner) per e.h.p. installed, or  8&apos; 294 per k.w. installed. Taking the previously adopted figure of 8-41 k.w.-years per metric ton of nitrogen fixed, the capital cost would thus be  69&apos; 75 per metric ton of nitrogen fixed per annum, or  15&apos; 5 per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) per annum in the form of dilute nitric acid. The above figures relate to an arc furnace installation of at least 15,000 to 20,000 k.w. capacity, and the informant considered that the cost in this country under pre-war conditions might be much lower.The Sub-Committee, after careful consideration, has adopted the figure quoted by the last informant as a safe maximum value for the capital cost of a large-scale installation in this country on the basis of the conditions prevailing prior to the war. Having regard, however, to the remarks already made concerning the costly lay-out under Norwegian conditions, it is possible that a large-scale plant could be installed &apos; in this country at an appreciably lower capital cost. As will be shown later, the capital cost is much higher in proportion in the case of plants below the minimum economic size of 15,000 to 20,000 k.w. capacity.Capital Cost of Acid Concentrating Section.The concentrating section of a nitric acid factory comprises evaporating apparatus in which the dilute acid is first brought to a strength of about 50 per cent, by the heat of the furnace gases, rectifying apparatus in which the acid is then raised to a strength of about 93 to 96 per cent, by distillation with concen-trated sulphuric acid, and apparatus for re-concentrating the sulphuric acid. The plant is somewhat elaborate in character and the&apos; capital cost is substantial.According to one witness the capital cost of the concentrating section of a large-scale installation amounts to  32&apos;2 per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum, or  7 &apos;15 per metric ton of HN03 (calcu-lated as 100 per cent.) per annum in the form of concentrated acid,A more recent figure places the capital cost at about  5 per metric ton of concentrated acid (calcu-lated as 100 per cent.) per annum, or  22 5 per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum.In view of the authoritative source of the latter figure, it has been adopted by the Sub-Committee.Overall Capital Cost of Complete Factory.An indication will now be given of the probable cost, on the basis of pre-war conditions in this country, of a complete nitric acid factory with an ad hoc steam-driven power plant.Having regard to the large power requirements of the arc process, it would be necessary in order to secure the maximum economy under British con-ditions, to instal the process in connection with a power station of large size. For the purpose of an example, a station having a capacity of 100,000 k.w. maximum demand has been taken, and the assumption made that the whole or a proportionate part of the capital cost is allocated to the arc furnace installation according to the size of the latter.The estimate of the Power Sub-Committee for the pre-war capital cost of such a station amounts to  10&apos;26 per k.w. demanded. Upon the basis of the figure previously adopted for the power requirements of the arc process, namely, 8&apos;41 k.w. years per&quot; metric ton of nitrogen fixed, the capital cost of the power section of an arc furnace installation would thus amount to 8&apos;41 x  10-26 -  86&apos;29 per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum, or  19117 per metric ton of HNO:! (calculated as 100 per cent.) per annum.The following table summarises the figures adopted by the Sub-Committee in respect of the capital costs of the various sections of the factory, and indicates the probable overall capital cost.ESTIMATED COST OF A NITRIC ACID FACTORY.- -Sections of Factory, *	  per metric ton per annum.

In the case, therefore, of a plant required to give a definite output of acid, Uie capital outlay involved would be gi-eater than for a plant having an equivalent output partly in the form of acid and partly as nitrate or nitrite.Influence of Size of Factory upon Capital Cost.Authoritative figures put forward concerning a small arc furnace installation below 12,000 k.w. capacity are worthy of record as illustrating the
enhanced capital cost of smaller scale plant. The figures in question, which are based upon pre-war prices in Norway, relate to an installation for producing concentrated nitric acid and indicate a capital cost of  13*64 per k.w. installed inclusive of concentrating plant, the latter item amounting to about  4-33 per lew. installed. The output is quoted as 0-12 metric ton of combined nitrogen per lew.-year, so that the capital cost per metric ton of nitrogen fixed per annum is  113166, the item for concentration plant accounting for  36i 08. The capital cost per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) per annum in the form of concentrated acid thus amounts to  25126, the corresponding figure for the concentra-tion plant being  8&apos; 02.According to these figures the cost of (he small-scale installation is over 23 per cent, greater, and of the concentrating section alone over 60 per cent, greater than in the case of a large-scale installation.Influence of Yield upon Capital Cost.An illustration may also be given of the effect of a substantial increase in the yield upon the capital cost of a large-scale plant, and for this purpose the assumed yield of 600 kg. rIN03 per k w.-year will be taken. Utilising the figure of  8-294 per k.w. installed (see p. 2351 for the cost of an installation for producing dilute acid, the figure of  5 per metric ton of HN03 per annum for the cost of the concentrating section, and the Power Sub-Oommittee&apos;s estimate for the cost of the power section, the following figures are obtained:	  per metric ton per annum.

As there are no solid materials to be handled the production costs, apart from the cost of energy, might be expected to be small, and this is bome out by the figures collected by the Sub-Committee.According to a statement based upon the working of a large-scale installation, the approximate pro-duction costs of dilute acid (30 to 40 per cent.), inclusive of depreciation but exclusive of power and of interest on capital, amount to  26-1 per metric ton of combined nitrogen, equivalent to  5-8 per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) in the form of dilute (30 to 40 per cent.) acid.Information derived from another source states that the working costs, exclusive of power, amountto  1 -825 per ton of HNO;i (calculated as 100 per cent.) in the form of dilute acid. This figure comprises an item of  0-325 for labour and an item of  1-5 for repairs, general charges, etc. The sodium nitrite obtained from the alkali absorption tower and representing about 12. per cent, of the total nitrogen fixed is stated to cost  15-325 per ton, but no indication is given of the items making up this cost. It is not clear from the statement whether the charges relate to metric tons or long tons, or whether they include amortization.Authoritative figures supplied concerning the cost of manufacturing dilute nitric acid on a large scale, place the cost at  2-25 to  2-53 per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) in the form of dilute acid, exclusive of the cost of energy and of interest on capital. The figures are inclusive of labour (at about  015 per metric ton), repairs, general charges such as rates, taxes, insurance, etc., amortiza-tion at an average of about 8 per cent, on the arc furnace installation, and materials (excepting soda for the alkaline absorption towers). For intermittent working or for smaller plants, the informant considered that the cost might be about 50 per cent. more. The reliability of the above figures is confirmed by other evidence dealing with standard Norwegian practice.With regard to the applicability of the figures io the working of a large-scale nitric acid installation in this country, the information at the disposal of the Sub-Committee tends to indicate that the rate of wages prevailing in Norway prior to the war for the class of work in question was of the same order as the rate prevailing in this country for similar work. The Sub-Committee therefore considers that, upon the basis of pre-war conditions, the production costs specified by the last witness would be on the safe side, and the following figure has been adopted:For dilute (30 to 40 per cent.) nitric- acid, the production cost, exclusive of the cost of energy and of interest on capital, has been taken at  2-5 per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) in the form of dilute acid, or  11-25 per metric ton of combined nitrogen. This figure includes labour, repairs, general charges, amortization of the arc furnace installation at an equated value of 8 per ceut., and materials (exclusive of soda for the alkaline absorption towers).Cost of Concentrating.It has already been pointed out that the waste heat of the gases from the arc furnaces of a large installa-tion is more than sufficient for the requirements of the concentrating plant. In spite of this advantage, the costs incurred in concentrating the dilute acid are substantial, as is shown by the figures quoted below.According to one witness the cost of concentrat-ing on a large scale amounts to  10 - 7 &apos; per metric ton of combined nitrogen, or  2 - 38 per metric ton 0 f HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) in the form of strong acid. This figure includes an allowance for depreciation, but is exclusive of, interest on the capital cost of the concentrating plant.Information from another source quotes a cost of about  3 per ton for concentrating 50 per cent, acid to a strength of 93 per cent.The authority responsible for the figures discussed in detail under the previous heading also stated that  2 per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) was adequate for the cost of concentrating dilute acid on a large scale by means of automatic plant, inclusive of all working expenses and depreciation. The relia-bility of this figure is confirmed by other evidence dealing with standard Norwegian practice and by information from an independent source.For the reasons which were stated, under the previous heading the Sub-Committee has adopted the following figure:lor concentrated (93 to 96 per cent.) nitric acid, the cost of concentration by means of the waste heat of the furnace gases has been taken at  2 per metric ton of HN03 (calcidated as 100 per cent.) in the form of strong acid, or  9 per metric ton of combined nitrogen The figure is inclusive of all working expenses, and of amortization of the concentrating section at an equated value cf 8 per cent., but is exclusive of interest on capital.
Influence of the Cost of Energy upon Production Costs.The following table indicates in a comparative manner the influence of the cost of energy upon the cost of manufacturing dihite or concentrated nitric acid by means of large-scale arc plant of say 25,000 k. w. capacity.The figures of  1-2 and  2 per k.w.-year represent the price of energy at &quot; cheap &quot; and &quot; average &quot; A&apos;or-wegian water power installations inclusive of all capital charges.The figure of  3*75 per k.w.-year represents the Power Sub-Committee&apos;s estimate  of  the  pre-warrunning costs of a steam turbo-electric power station of 100,000 k.w. maximum demand operating at an annual load factor of 97&apos;5 per cent. (8,540 hours) and with coal at 7s. 6d. per ton, inclusive of all capital charges. The corresponding estimate for a load factor of 100 per cent., i.e., for a k.w.-year of 8,760 hours, amounts to  3&apos;8. Having regard, however, to the economies that can be effected by the utilisation of the waste heat of the arc furnace gases for steam raising, this Sub-Oommittee has taken a figure of  3-75 per k.w.-year of 8,760 hours as the possible.o cost of energy under British conditions if the am process were installed at a power station of the siza previously mentioned. The effect of more costly energy is indicated later.ESTIMATED PRODUCTION COST OF NITRIC ACID.	Production costs in (calculated		  per metric ton of HN03 as 100 per cent.).		Cost Items.

Figures can readily be obtained for still higher costs when it is remembered that for each additional  1 per k.w.-year the manu-facturing costs are increased by  1-87 per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.).It will be seen that even with steam-generated power at a higher figure than  3-75 per k.w.-year, a large-scale arc plant would be capable of producing concentrated nitric acid at a cost substantially lower than the pre-war cost of manufacturing concentrated nitric acid from Chile nitrate. Taking the latter cost (Section I.) at  22-33 per metric ton of HN03 (cal-culated as 100 per cent.), it appears that the arc process, even when allowance is made for interest at the rate of 5 per cent, on the cost of the chemical installation, will be at an advantage as compared with the retort process as long as the cost of the energy does not exceed  9 per k.w.-year of 8,760 hours (approximately 0 - 25d. per k.w.-hour).In the event of the attainment of higher yields than the figure adopted by the Sub-Committee, the pro-duction costs would be substantially diminished owing to the smaller consumption of energy per metric ton of nitrogen fixed. Taking, for example, the assumed higher yield of 600 kg. HN03 per k.w.-year, and making an allowance for the saving of 5 per cent, of the cost of the energy by the efficient utilisation of the waste heat, the production costs with energy at  3&apos; 75 pel&apos; k.w.-year would be reduced to  8-44 per metric ton of HNO3 (calculated as 100 per cent.) in the case of weak acid, and to  10-44 in the case of strong acid.The arc process has advantages over other synthetic processes as a direct and comparatively simple method of obtaining concentrated nitric acid, and the figures already given show that it is not an unattractive pro-position from the point of view of this country, even when reliance has to be placed upon steam-drivenQ
power plant, The process is, however, hampered by a very heavy capital outlay and involves an extensive chemical installation. The successful commercial development of any improvements resulting in-a sub-stantially higher yield or in the avoidance of the present types of absorption tower plant would materially affect the prospects of the arc process in industrial countries lacking in cheap water power.A brief account will now be given of the evidence available to the Sub-Committee concerning the com-mercial operations of the Pauling and Moscicki processes which have attained some measure of success, the former in Italy and Austria, and the latter in Switzerland, though not on a scale comparable with that of the Birkeland-Eyde in Norway. The two pro-cesses differ in a number of interesting features from the Norwegian practice as will be apparent from a comparison of the evidence given below with that already presented.THE PAULING PROCESS.According to authoritative information, the original Pauling furnace, which is described in many technical publications (e.g., Norton, p. 65, et seq.) gave unsatis-factory results in its early stages of development in Italy, the yield never amounting to more than 23 or 25 gms. of HNOl( per k.w.-hour. Investigations upon this point appear to have established the fact that finely divided iron oxide was carried off by the gas current froni the water-cooled iron electrodes, and that this exerted a prejudicial effect upon the yield. It was eventually concluded that the iron oxide in suspension in the gases exerted a catalytic effect in accelerating the decomposition of the nitric oxide during the cooling of the gases after leaving the arc. The employment of electrodes consisting of an alloy of aluminium was found to avoid the above drawback and also to lead to another advantage in that the interior of the furnace became coated with a deposit of non-conducting alumina, thus improving the insulation.Size of Installation and Furnaces.The two installations in Italy have capacities of 9,000 k.w. and 5,000 k.w. respectively, and the furnaces employed are much smaller than those used in Norway, having a capacity of 500 to 600 lew. only. In the newer furnaces the electrodes are placed very close together at their point of convergence and no auxiliary starting circuit is needed, as was the case with earlier types. The furnaces are supplied at a pressure of 5,000 volts, measured outside the series inductances connected to the electrodes. The power factor of the furnaces is about 0&apos;6.The power supply of both installations is of an intermittent character, an arrangement with the power company enabling the proper number of furnaces for which power is available at any time to be brought into operation. No difficulty due to intermittent working appears to have been met with.Utilisation of Waste Heat.A steam boiler is placed directly over the furnace in order to utilise the heat of the gases, the steam produced being employed for concentrating the dilute acid from the absorption towers. It is proposed in connection with the installation of new furnaces to place the latter inside the boiler so as to make use of much more of the waste heat.Concentration of Nitric Oxide in Furnace Gases.The concentration of nitric oxide in the furnace gases is substantially lower than that obtained in the normal Norwegian practice, amounting to 0-8 per cent. only. It is stated that if the velocity of the air through the furnaces is reduced in- order to obtain a higher concentration of nitric oxide, the nett recovery decreases.Recovery Operations.Owing to the low concentration of nitric oxide, the volume of the gases to be dealt with in the absorption towers is very large, and the evidence available indicates that the recovery of a metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.), involves the passage of over 1,500,000 cu. ft. of air through the furnaces and absorption system.The factors governing efficient recovery have already been enumerated, and their effect is strikingly illus-trated by the enormous dimensions of the absorption plant of the Pauling installations. In addition to an empty oxidation tower having an internal capacity of ; 2,000 cu. m. (70,620 cu. ft.), there are live acid absorp-tion towers, each 20 m. (65-6 ft.) high and 5 m, (16 &apos;4 ft.) in diameter, followed by four alkaline absorp-tion towers of iron, each 22 m. (72 ft.) high and 3-5 m. (11-5 ft.) in diameter.The dilute nitric acid from the main towers has a strength of 23 to 25 per cent, only, 80 per cent, of the combined nitrogen recovered being in the form of nitric acid and the remainder in the form of sodium nitrite.Losses of Combined Nitrogen.It is stated that the gases issuing from the last tower contain only from 0-005 to 0-01 per cent, of nitric oxide. This corresponds to a loss of the order of 1 per cent., and represents a very high efficiency in the recovery operations.;Concentration of Dilute Acid.The dilute acid is first rectified under reduced pressure by steam heating, and the resulting acid of about 40 per cent, strength is then concentrated by means of sulphuric acid, also under reduced pressure. No information is available as to the losses of combined nitrogen during these operations.7.:::::.     ;&apos; .&quot; . :&apos;&apos; ;:.v ;, &apos;&apos; .. ; :-i&apos; V&apos;.\iyp\ :-,   . ;        - \;pp;: is;;- i,sy tyM? &apos; jYield or Output for Energy consumed.The products actually recovered from the towers in the form of dilute acid and sodium nitrite are stated to be equivalent to a yield of 75 gms. of HNOs (calculated as 100 per cent.) per k.w.-hour measured at the furnace terminals. This figure is equivalent to 657 kg. of HNO:! (calculated as 100 per cent.) per k.w.-year of 8,760 hours, and may be compared with the figure of 535 kg. adopted by the Sub-Committee in the case of the Birkeland-Eyde process.Upon the above basis, the power requirements amount to 1 - 52 k.w.-years of 8,760 hours per&apos;metric ton of IIN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.), or 6 -85 k.w.-years of 8,760 hours per metric ton of combined nitrogen.Costs.The Sub-Committee has no details as to the capital and operating costs involved in the Pauling process.THE MOSCICKI PROCESS.The Moscicki process presents distinct departures from other arc practice in respect of the construction of the electric furnaces, and also of the absorption apparatus, brief descriptions of which are given below. It is claimed that the process possesses advantages over other arc processes by reason of the reduced volume of air passed through the furnaces, the more rapid cooling of the gases issuing from the arc, and the higher concentration of nitric oxide in the gases to be treated in the absorption plant.Size of Installation and of Furnaces.As far as is known, the only commercial installation at which the Moscicki process is in operation is that at Chippis in Switzerland, which comprises 12 arc furnaces, of which two are in reserve, each furnace having a capacity of 1,000 k.w.
Construction o  Furnaces and Electrical Details.The furnaces comprise two concentric electrodes, the space between them being occupied by an arc which revolves under the influence of a powerful rnag-netic field with lines of force parallel to the common axis of the electrodes. The revolving flame more or less permanently fills that section of the furnace where the electrodes are in proximity, The rapid cooling of the gases is effected by employing a water-cooled electrode provided with outlets for the passage of the gases.The furnaces are supplied with alternating current at a pressure of 8,000 volts. No information is avail-able as to the power factor, but experiments appear to have been in progress with a view to improving it.The electrodes last on an average about four weeks, and the furnace itself, if operated continuously, lasts about two yeai*s.Concentration of Nitric Oxide in Furnace Gases.The concentration of nitric oxide in the furnace gases is stated to vary from 1- 5 to 2 per cent., the average concentration being 116 per cent.Recovery Operations.The absorption apparatus employed is of special design and provides a very large surface of liquid for absorbing the oxides of nitrogen in the gases. The apparatus consists essentially of a series of compart-ments packed with filling material such as broken quartz, the gases traversing the material in a horizontal direction while the solution is introduced at the top of each compartment, and thus flows in a direction at right angles to the path of the gases. The weaker solutions from the rear compartments are carried to the top of the preceding compartments nearer the entering gases, and are discharged on to the packing material intermittently in order to provide intervals of time for the re-oxidation of the nitric oxide liberated during the absorption cycle. (See also Journal of the Society of Chemical Industry, 1917, Vol. 36, No, 14, pp. 774-775).The dilute acid obtained from the towers has a strength of 30o Be, thus containing about 40 per cent, by weight of nitric acid.No information is available as to whether alkaline absorption chambers are employed in addition to the acid absorption apparatus.Concentration of Dilute Acid.The acid is concentrated in two stages in towers filled with broken quartz. In the first tower, the the dilute acid is heated by the furnace gases on their way to the absorption apparatus, and in this way is concentrated to a strength of 70 per cent. The final concentration to a strength of 93 per cent, is effected in the second tower by means of sulphuric acid, the latter being regenerated with a loss of about 3 per cent.Yield or Output for Energy consumed.The yield at Ohippis with gases having a concen-tration of 1&apos;6 per cent, of nitric oxide is stated to amount to &quot; 50 gms. of normal acid &quot; per k.w.-hour. Assuming this statement to indicate 100 per cent, nitric acid, the output would thus amount to 438 kg. of HNO:i (calculated as 100 per cent.) per k.w.-year of 8,760 hours, as compared with 535 k.g. in the case of the Norwegian process. The power requirements of the Moscicki process, on theb asis of the above figures, would be 2-28 k.w.-years of 8,760 hours per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 500 per cent.), or 10 &quot;27 k.w.-years per metric ton of combined nitrogen.Evidence on Costs of Moscicki Process.A certain amount of evidence is available to the Sub-Committee concerning the order of the costsinvolved in the installation and operation of the Moscicki process, and is summarised below.Capital Cost. The factory at Ohippis is stated to have been erected in about six months and the probable cost is placed at  68,000 to  72,000, inclusive of con-concentrating plant, but exclusive of the hydro-electric power section and fittings. These figures represent a capital cost of  5 - 6 to  6 per k.w. installed. If the output of the factory upon the basis of previous figures is taken at 4,200 metric tons of HNO;i (calculated as 100 per cent.) per year of 50 weeks, the capital cost would amount to from  16-2 to  17 -1 per metric ton of HNO3 per annum,According to other evidence, the estimated cost under French conditions of an arc furnace installation of the same size, inclusive of the purchase of patent licences, is placed at  100,000, equivalent to  8-3 per k.w. installed. Taking the out-put at the figure given above, the estimated capital cost would amount to  23-8 per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) per annum.Another estimate under examination deals with the probable cost in this country under post-war con-ditions of a Moscicki arc furnace installation of 13,000 k.w. capacity. The yield of HNO:( per Lw.-hour is taken at 60 gms., and the total output at 6,000 metric tons of 93 per cent, nitric acid per year of about 7,700 working hours, thus allowing a margin of 7 per cent, for losses during the recovery and concentrating operations. Deducting the allowance made for the cost of patent licences, the probable cost of the chemical installation is given as follows : 		Strong Acid		(93 per cent.)	Total.	Per Metric	-	Ton		per annum.

The two estimates of capital costs quoted above are accom-panied by estimates of the operating costs which are summarised below. It should be noted, however, that in each case the figures have been modified by the Sub-Committee in order to exclude interest upon capital, and also the cost of the necessary electrical energy.The estimated operating costs under French con-ditions are as follows: Total.Manufacturing costs, including labour, supervision, manage-ment, office ex-peuses, raw mate-rials, &amp;c.      -     -    8,000Upkeep and repairs -    2,000Amortisation at 12 per cent, on  100,000 -  12,000Total    -     -  22,000HNOa (calculated as 100 per cent.)

The estimated operating costs under British ditions are as follows: con-Materials  and  cost  of.concentration Wages and salaries -Rent, taxes, &amp;c. Depreciation and repairsat   10  per  cent, on 67,000Total 8,000 8,000 2,000Strong Acid (1)3 per cent) Pci&apos; Metric Ton.&amp;1-33 1-33 0-33Total0,700 -  2-1,700equivalent to  4 - 4 per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.).Observations.The capital costs quoted above in respect of instal-lations having a capacity of 12,000 to 13,000 k.w. vary between  5 and  8 - 3 per k.w. installed, and between  12 and  23 - 8 per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as100 per cent.) per annum, the highest figures in each case including an unspecified payment for patents. The corresponding capital costs of a Norwegian plant of similar capacity referred to earlier in this sectioD amounted to  13-64 per k.w. installed, or  25*26 pc metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent,) per annum.With regard to the operating costs, exclusive of the cost of energy, the estimates given above vary between  4*4 and  5*2 per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) in the form of concentrated acid, as compared with a figure of  4-5 in the case of the Norwegian process.Prom a review of the evidence, it appears probable that the capital cost in the case of the Moscicki process will be somewhat lower than that of Norwegian plant principally on account of the less elaborate character of the absorption plant. On the other hand, the operating costs although including a lower charge for depreciation of capital, appear to be on a parity with those incurred in Norwegian practice. Account, however, mast also be taken of the lower yield of the Moscicki furnaces as this factor will add to the cost of the electrical energy required per ton of nitric acid produced, and thus to the final cost of the acid.RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE AEC PROCESS.It has already been pointed out that there is con-siderable scope for improvement in the economics of the arc process not only in the direction of increasing the output of combined nitrogen per unit of energy consumed, but also of effecting the recovery of the nitrogen without the employment of the large and costly absorption towers required in existing practice. Although the efforts hitherto made have not attained commercial success, a brief account is given below of some of the more recent proposals in order to show the lines upon which solutions of the problem have been attempted.Schloesing&apos;s method of Dry Absorption.Among the several methods proposed for the direct recovery of the combined nitrogen in arc furnace gases in the form of a solid salt, that devised by Schloesing appears to be the only one that has been tried upon a sufficient scale to justify its consideration as a commercial possibility.The process is based upon the experimental obser-vations that when gases containing oxides of nitrogen are passed over specially prepared quicklime at a temperature of 300o to 400o 0., the oxides are absorbed and a mixture of nitrate and nitrite obtained. By the continued passage of the gases, however, the nitrite is converted into nitrate, a pure nitrate being eventually obtained.It has been shown that the gases, especially when the percentage of oxides of nitrogen is small, as in the case of arc furnace gases, should not contain either water vapour or carbon dioxide in any considerably quan-tity, because the former leads to a partial fusion of the absorbing material, and the latter converts the quicklime into carbonate, the efficiency of the absorp-tion being impaired in both caser. In order to obtain a solid product containing a high nitrogen content, it is necessary to employ lime of good quality which has been calcined at a low temperature and also in pieces of uniform size and permeability. To this end the calcined lime is slaked with a proper proportion of water so that the hydration is complete and a homo-geneous product obtained, the latter being agglome-rated by pressure into pastilles or briquettes of uniform dimensions and afterwards completely dried and de-hydrated at a temperature of 500o to 600o 0.The process has been tried upon a large experi-niental scale at Notodden with an arc furnace of about 400 k.w. capacity, the heat of the furnace gases being utilised to perform the calcining and dehydratingoperations, to maintain the quicklime at the reaction temperature, and to reconcentrate the sulphuric acid employed for absorbing moisture from the air supplied to the furnace. The whole of the plant through which the gases circulated was also maintained gas-tight in order to avoid the ingress of moist air. No special steps were taken in these experiments to remove the small percentage of cai*bon dioxide nor-mally present in the air supplied to the furnace.It is stated that the absorption of the oxides of nitrogen was complete and that when operating under good conditions, the lime nitrate obtained contained 14 - 5 per cent, of nitrogen. Under ordinary conditions, the average nitrogen content amounted to 14 per cent., and in all cases the product contained free lime to the extent of about 12 or 13 per cent.As the outcome of the above trials, which seem to have given very satisfactory resitlts, plans were in contemplation prior to the war for the more extended testing of the process on a scale of about 6,000 k.w. This project, however, does not appear to have matured.No evidence is available to the Sub-Committee as to the relative costs of wet and dry absorption, but the latter process appears to have some merits for the manufacture of lime nitrate because the absorption plant is much less elaborate and probably much less costly than the granite towers employed for wet absorption. On the other hand, special care has to be taken in drying the air supplied to the furnace, and also in the preparation of the quicklime in order to render the latter sensitive throughout its mass.With regard to the general problem of the dry absorption of oxides of nitrogen, it is interesting to note that the statement made by M. Oswald (Annalen der Chimie, 1914, LXL, 32), that the interaction of lime and nitrogen peroxide is always accompanied by the evolution of elementary nitrogen according to the equation:2 CaO-f 5 N0^2 Ca (N03)2H-Nseems to be confirmed by the research carried out under the direction of the Experiments Sub-Com-mittee.No definite evidence is available to the Sub-Com-committee as to the influence of this reaction in the operation of the Schloesing process.Guye&apos;s modified System of working.According to a report supplied to the Sub-Com-mittee, the result of recent experimental work in
Switzerland lias shown that the yield of combined nitrogen from arc furnaces can bo increased by more than 25 per cent, by the addition of 50 per cent, of oxygen to the air supply, and that a further increase of about 25 per cent, is obtained if the furnace is operated under an absolute pressure of about half an atmosphere.It has also been shown that the recovery of oxides of nitrogen from the furnace gases can be effected without the employment of absorption towers by cooling the gases to - 90oO, nitrogen peroxide separat-ing out in the liquefied form. The product can be stored in steel tanks or cylinders, and marketed for use in different nitrification processes, or can be converted into concentrated nitric acid without the employment of concentrating apparatus by autoclaving with water in the presence of oxygen at a pressure of five atmosphere-pheres.The system of working involves a closed furnace of special design and the recirculation of the gases through the furnace after the condensation of the nitrogen peroxide, economy in the consumption of oxygen being an important consideration. Moreover, it is necessary to ensure that the gases entering the furnace are absolutely dry, because the presence of even a small percentage of moisture not only causes a substantial reduction in the yield (for example by about 10 per cent.) but also leads to the corrosion of the condensing plant owing to the formation of nitric acid.According to the report, it is considered that the cost of the plant required for operating the process will be no higher than that of existing arc furnace installations, because the employment of large and expensive absorption towers is avoided, and the apparatus required for obtaining concentrated nitric acid direct is comparatively simple. The power neces-sary for separating the oxygen from the air and for condensing the nitrogen peroxide can be obtained by utilising the heat of the furnace gases.It is understood that the more extended trial of this process on a scale of about 250 k.w. is contem-plated.Kilburn Scott Three-phase Furnace.Considerable interest has been taken in this country in a three-phase arc furnace devised by Kilburn Scott. The furnace exhibits a number of departures from the standard types in vogue abroad, and a brief description is given below of its main characteristics.The lower part of the furnace where the air is admitted is in the form of a conical reaction chamber, three water-cooled electrodes being spaced around the walls at 120o apart. The arc is started by means of pilot sparks between the main electrodes and an auxiliary electrode situated in the gap between the converging tips of the main electrodes just above the air admission pipe. The high -frequency pilot sparks which are in an independent high tension circuit are conveniently maintained during the operation of the furnace, and it is stated that they improve the yield and help to maintain continuity of working. The upward current of air, which is advantageously pre-heated to about 250o C. blows the three-phase arc into a flame which spreads up the diverging electrodes. The employment of an auxiliary magnetic field for spreading the arc as in the Birkeland-Eyde furnaces is thus rendered unnecessary. To promote the rapid cooling of the furnace gases and minimise the dissociation &apos; of the nitric oxide formed, the reaction chamber is surmounted by a steam boiler which con-stitutes the roof of the furnace and is earthed in order to avoid electrical leakage. The metal of the boiler is not attacked by the furnace gases at the temperatures involved. The steam raised in cooling the gases repre-sents a considerable economy in working, and it is claimed that the regenerative gain by utilising the steam in a mixed pressure turbine will amount to over 10 per cent.A three-phase furnace is claimed t&amp; have a special advantage as regards the intimacy of contact between the whole of the air and the arc, owing to the fact that a revolving arc is continuously maintained by the current always flowing in the phases, whereas in single-phase furnaces the energy varies from zero to a maximum twice in each alternation.As the result of trials with a small experimental furnace, it is considered commercially feasible to obtain yields about 50 per cent, higher than the usual yield of 50 to 60 gms. of HNO;, per k,w.-hour obtained -with standard types of single-phase furnaces. (Journal of the Society of Chemical Industry 1915, Yol. 34 No. 3, and 191V, Vol. 36, No. 14.)According to information available to the Sub-Committee, the results of recent trials carried out with a three phase furnace of about 300 k.w capacity have not fulfilled the expectations based upon the working of the small scale experiments.The Island Furnace.Information has been supplied  to the Sub-Com-mittee concerning the results of investigations carried out in Canada with an arc furnace devised by Dr. J. S Island, of Toronto, which is considered to hold out the prospect of giving a substantially larger yield than that hitherto attained in commercial practice.The furnace comprises a stabilising air chamber in which is mounted an insulating shaft carrying a rotary electrode of circular shape. The fixed electrode is in the form of a hollow annuius surrounding the rotating electrode, and the air supply is admitted to the hollow electrode and passes out through radial openings into the central zone of the arc. The furnace gases pass into a pipe containing cooling coils and then to absorption towers.It is claimed that the advantages of the furnace and its auxiliary apparatus are simplicity, the possi-bility of employing small units, the more efficient contact between the arc and the air supply than in other types of furnace, and the possibility of cooling the furnace gases immediately they leave the arc.The information available indicates that the trial installation comprises a furnace of about 50 k.w. capacity, alkaline absorption towers, and equipment for measuring the energy purchased and the energy actually consumed by the furnace. According to the results of independent tests carried out with the plant, it appears that duplicate determinations of the amount of combined nitrogen actually recovered in the absorp-tion towers indicated a yield equivalent to over 100 gms. of HNOs (calculated as 100 per cent.) per k.w.-hour purchased.Until these yields have been substantiated by the commercial operation of furnaces of much larger capacity, the claims made for the furnace cannot be regarded as established. It is understood, however, that the Island furnace is - to be tried upon a larger scale in this country, and in that event an opportunity will be afforded of gauging the prospects of the apparatus.Observations.In considering the claims made for substantial increases in the yield of nitric acid per k.w.-hour by the use of modified apparatus or methods of working, it must be borne in mind that the precise conditions and factors leading to favourable results upon a small experimental scale are difficult to attain or reproduce when similar operations are carried out upon a com-mercial scale. Past experience in the development of the arc process has shown that an increase in the size of a furnace has in some cases been accompanied by a diminution in the yield. It is clear, therefore, that the indications of small scale experiments can only be regarded as tentative and subject to confirmation by trial upon an adequate scale.
MANUFACTURE OE SYNTHETIC NITRATES BY THEARC PROCESS.In consequence of the difficulties involved in the transport of nitric acid in bulk, and of the fact that the demand for nitric acid under normal conditions is much smaller than the demand for fertilisers, the con-version of the primary product of the arc process into lime nitrate has been carried out on a large scale in Norway.The dilute nitric acid from the towers is passed into granite tanks charged with ordinary limestone and the neutralization of the acid is completed by the addition of lime. The solution is evaporated by the waste heat of the furnace gases, and the resulting product consists of a &quot; basic &quot; nitrate of lime containing about 13 per cent, of combined nitrogen and having the following approximate composition, namely, lought ^-26 per cent., Nj05=50 - 2 per cent. It has been claimed that the basic nitrate keeps dry, and thus avoids the troubles experienced with the hygro-scopic forms of lime nitrate originally manufactured. Unfortunately, the basic nitrate is also hygroscopic, and in consequence is less convenient to handle and put on the land than nitrate of soda. Apart from this drawback the material is an excellent fertiliser, its lime content being a valuable asset in soils deficient in this constituent.&apos;ECONOMICS OF THE PROCESSES.The costs incurred in the manufacture of weak nitric acid have been dealt with in detail above. The conversion of the acid into a solid nitrate of lime or soda packed in readiness for placing on the market in competition with Chile nitrate entails a serious addition to the original cost of the combined nitrogen. The information which has come before the Sub-Committee on this point is set out below.Capital Cost of Nitrate Factory.The capital cost of an arc furnace and nitrate installation for manufacturing lime nitrate appears to be approximately of the same order as that of an installation for making concentrated nitric acid. The hygroscopic character of lime nitrate renders it neces-sary to employ tight wooden barrels or casks for packing purposes, and the low nitrogen content of the material (13 per cent. N) entails the handling and packing of about 7- 7 tons of product for every ton of combined nitrogen obtained from the arc furnace plant in the form of dilute nitric acid. It is clear, therefore, that the cost of the necessary evaporating, crushing, and packing plant will constitute a s\ib-stantial addition to that of an arc furnace installation producing weak acid.According to one source of information the capital cost of a large installation exclusive of a power section amounts to  116- 6 per metric ton of com-bined nitrogen per annum, or  15-16 per metric ton of lime nitrate (13 per cent. N) per annum. Taking the witness&apos;s own figure for the cost of the dilute acid section of the plant, the cost of the nitrate section alone amounts to  30 * 5 per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum, or  3- 96 per metric ton of lime nitrate (13 per cent. N) per annum.Another authority quoted a capital cost of  7 &quot;6 (135 kroner) per e.h.p. installed, or  10-18 per k.w. installed, for a large-scale nitrate factory, exclusive of a power section. On the basis of 8-41 k.w.-years per metric ton of nitrogen fixed, the cost of the installation would thus amount to  85-61 per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum, or  11 -13 per metric ton of lime nitrate (13 per cent. N) per annuin. The figure given by the same authority for the capital cost of the dilute acid section indicates that the cost of the nitrate section alone amounts - to  15-86 per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum, or  2-06 per metric ton of lime nitrate (13 per cent. N) per annum.An authoritative figure for a lime nitrate factory of medium size indicates a capital cost of  11- 88 per k.w. installed. The yield quoted is equivalent to about 117&apos;8 kg. of combined nitrogen per kw.-year, corresponding to a capital cost of  100&apos;85per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum, or  13-11 per metric ton of lime nitrate (13 per cent. N) per annum.From a consideration of the abjjve figures, which are based upon Norwegian practice, the Sub-Corn-mittee is of the opinion that the capital cost of a large-scale arc furnace and lime nitrate installation, on the basis of pre-war conditions in this country, should not exceed about  12 per metric ton of lime nitrate (13 per cent. N) per annum, equivalent to about  92 &quot;3 per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum. Taking the figure already adopted for the capital cost of an installation for producing dilute nitric acid, namely,  69 - 75 per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum, the cost of the nitrate section alone would amount to  22&apos;55 per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum, or  2 - 93 per metric ton of lime nitrate (13 per cent. N) per annum.As previously indicated (see p. 235), the capital cost of the steam turbo-electric power section for a large-scale arc plant would amount to  86&apos; 39 per metric ton of nitrogen fixed per annum, so that the overall capital cost of a lime nitrate factory with power section would amount to about  178&apos; 6 per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum, or  23 - 22 per metric ton of lime nitrate (13 per cent. N) per annum.The cost of an installation for manufacturing synthetic sodium nitrate would probably be some-what lower than that of one for making lime nitrate In the first place the sodium salt has a higher nitrogen content (about 15-6 per cent. N), and the conversion of every ton of combined nitrogen obtained in the form of dilute acid involves the handling and packing of about 6 -45 tons of sodium nitrate as against about 7 - 7 tons in the case of lime nitrate. Moreover, the sodium salt is non-hygroscopic and can be packed in bags instead of casks, thus necessitating a less elaborate packing installation than in the case of lime nitrate and resulting in a reduction in the cost of this section of the plant. No definite figures, however, aB to the probable cost of a factory for making sodium nitrate have been before the Sub-Committee.Production Costs of Lime Nitrate.Only one definite figure for the production costs of lime nitrate based upon Norwegian practice has been under consideration. According to this figure, the overall production costs, exclusive of power, amount to  36&apos;4 per metric ton of combined nitrogen in the form of lime nitrate, as compared with  26-1 in the case of the dilute acid alone. This represents a-con-version cost of  10-3 per metric ton of combined nitrogen, or  1-339 per metric ton of lime nitrate (13 per cent. N), exclusive of power and of interest.Taking the informants own figure of 8-43 k,w.-years per metric ton of nitrogen fixed, and the Power Sub-Comroittee&apos;s estimate of  3-75 per k.w.-year for the running cost of a large-scale steam turbo-electric plant, the total production costs in-clusive of power would amount to  68 - 01 per metric ton of combined nitrogen, or  8*841 per metric ton of lime nitrate (13 per cent. N).Other figures in the form of detailed estimates have also been under review by the Sub-Committee and represent attempts to arrive at the probable cost of manufacturing lime nitrate in this country under pre-war conditions by means of a large-scale ad hoc arc furnace installation. They are based upon the previously adopted figure (see p. 237) for the produc-tion cost of dilute nitric acid, viz.,  9&apos;512 per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) with energy at  3-75 per k.w.-year, and upon the following considerations.The neutralization of one metric ton of HNO;) (in the form of dilute acid) will result in approximately 1 - 71 metric tons of lime nitrate (13 per cent. N) of the composition previously specified, and will require about 0 - 8 metric ton of limestone and, say, 0 - 05 metric ton of lime. With regard to the cost of the latter materials, the limestone maybe taken at  0-375 and the lime at  0 - 75 per metric ton, representing a charge
APPENDIX V. : AltO PROCESS.24%of  0*337 per metric ton of HNl);, neutralized. The operating costs for labour, repairs, general expenses, and depreciation of the nitrate section at an ecpiated figure of 8 per cent, would probably amount to about  1 per metric ton of lime nitrate in the case of a small factory. For a large factory, however, with modern labour-saving appliances and packing arrangements, it is possible that a figure of  0- 5 per ton would be sufficient, and this value has been adopted in the estimate given below. The cost of the casks required for packing the nitrate will represent a substantial item, amounting to about  1-25 per metric ton of nitrate on the basis of pre-war prices.Allowing for mechanical and other losses during manufacture amounting to about 2-5 per cent., every metric ton of HN03 neutralized will yield 1-67 metric tons of lime nitrate (13 per cent. N), the estimated cost of production being:Lime Nitrate (13 per cent. N)per 1-07metric tons.HNQi: 1 ton in form of 30 to 10 per cent, acid (with energy at  3-75 per k.w.-year)      ....Limestone : 0&apos;8 ton at  0-375 and limeO-OSton at  0-75 per tonLabour, repairs, expenses, and depreciation at 8 per cent, on nitrate sectionTotal (unpacked)Packages: casks -Total (packed) -9-512(1-337per metric ton. 5-69(10-2020-500 6-398 1-250 7 648The equivalent values of a metric ton of combined nitrogen in the form of lime nitrate (13 per cent. N) are  49 - 22 in the case of the unpacked product and  58&apos; 83 in the case of the packed product.The above figures are exclusive of interest on the capital cost of the acid and nitrate sections of the factory, and if an allowance is made for this item at the rate of 5 per cent, on the figure of  12 previously given, the production costs per metric ton of lime nitrate (13 per cent. N) would amount to  6 - 998 for the unpacked product and  8-248 for the packed product.With cheaper nitric acid such as would be obtain-able with energy at the lower figures previously quoted, namely,  3,  2, and  1-2 per k.w.-year, the cost of manufacturing lime nitrate would be as follows for the packed product:Per metric ton of:                    Lime Nitrate (13 percent. N) - - - 6-808 5 689 4 792 Combined Nitrogen - 52 37 43&apos;76 36-86 The pre-war market price of calcium nitrate in this country amounted to  9-75 per long ton, or  9-59 per metric ton, equivalent, in the case of a nitrogen content of 13 per cent., to  73-8 per metric ton of combined nitrogen.Production Costs of Sodium Nitrate.An estimate, on similar fines to that given above, dealing with the probable costs of making sodium nitrate by means of arc furnace plant has also been under review. It is based upon the following considerations.The neutralisation of one metric ton of HN03 (in the form of dilute acid) with 0 - 841 metric ton of pure soda ash would yield 1 - 349 metric tons of pure sodium nitrate containing 16 -47 per cent, of nitrogen. In practice, however, a product might be prepared for competition with Chile nitrate containing, say, 95 per cent, of sodium nitrate and&apos;a certain proportion of moisture. A yield of 1&apos;425 metric tons of sodium nitrate (15-6 per cent. N) would thus be obtained from every ton of HN03 neutralized. The cost of the soda ash may be taken at  3 per metric ton, repre-senting a charge of  2 - 523 per metric ton of HN03 neutralized. The operating costs have been taken at the figure given in the previous estimate.   The cost ofpicking, however, will be materially lower as bags can Da used in place of casks, and on the basis of pre-war prices will amount to about  0-25 per metric ton of nitrate.Allowing as before for a loss of 2 - 5 per cent, during manufacture, every metric ton of HN03 neutralized will yield 1-39 metric tons of sodium nitrate (15-6 per cent. N), the estimated cost of production being :Sodium Nitrate (15-6 per cent. N)per 1-39      per metric      metrt tons.       ton.HNOa: 1 *m in form of 30 to 10 per cent, acid (with energy at  3-75 per k.w.-year)      ....Soda ash: 0-841 ton at  3 per ton  &quot; -Operating costs including depreciation (as before)   -Total (unpacked)Packing : 20 bags at Zd. eachTotal (packed) - 9-512 2-523.  .6-813 1-815 0-500 9-158 0-250 9-408The equivalent values per metric ton of combined nitrogen in the form of sodium nitrate (15-6 per cent. N) are  58-70 for the unpacked product and  60&apos; 31 for the packed product.If soda ash were obtainable at half the price taken above, the production costs would be reduced to about  8*251 and  8-501 for the unpacked and packed product respectively, the equivalent values per metric ton of combined nitrogen being  52-89 and  54-49.The above figures are exclusive of interest on the capital cost of the acid and nitrate sections of the factory and this item will probably be lower than in the case of lime nitrate on account of less costly packing plant required.With soda ash at  3 per ton, and nitric acid at the reduced costs obtainable with energy at  3,  2, and  1-2 per k.w.-year, the cost of manufacturing sodium nitrate would be as follows for the packed product:Per metric ton of:                    Sodium Nitrate (15*6percent. N)  -     -  8-399 7*054 5-978 Combined Nitrogen  - 53*84  45* 22  38*32The factory costs involved in the manufacture of synthetic sodium nitrate may be compared with the pre-war market price (average 1911-13) of Chile nitrate, namely,  10-69 per long ton, or  67*21 per metric ton of combined nitrogen.Observations.Even in the case of the arc process where waste heat is available for evaporating purposes, the cost of manufacturing synthetic nitrates is substantial.From a consideration of the above figures it appears that if the cost of a metric ton of combined nitrogen in the form of dilute acid is given, the additional cost of the equivalent quantity of combined nitrogen in the form of a salt packed for the market amounts to about  16 in the case of lime nitrate (13 per cent. N), and to about  17 in the case of sodium nitrate (15-6 per cent. N) with soda ash at  3 per ton. These figures represent the cost of conversion and packing, inclusive of losses, but are exclusive of interest on the capital cost of the chemical sections of the factory.The conversion costs are greater in the case of processes involving the use of fuel for evaporating purposes,&apos; as is shown when dealing with the manu-facture of synthetic nitrates by the ammonia oxidation process (Section VII.).The influence of the cost of energy up to  6 per k.w.-year upon the cost of manufacturing limo nitrate and sodium nitrate by the arc process is shown on Chart A at the end of the Appendix.The cost of manufacturing ammonium nitrate by neutralizing the dilute acid from the arc process with ammonia is dealt with in detail in Section VIII,
SECTION IY.THE HABER PROCESS FOR THE SYNTHESISOF AMMONIA.The synthesis of ammonia from hydrogen and nitrogen is effected by passing a suitably proportioned mixture of the gases at a pressure of from 100 to 200 atmospheres over a catalyst heated to a temperature of about 550&quot; O, a small percentage of the gases, depending upon the nature of the catalyst and the condition of working, being converted into ammonia. The latter is removed from the circulatory system by condensation or absorption, and the residual gases are passed into the system again together with a supply of fresh gas mixture. The technical success of the process depends very largely upon the nature and life of the catalyst used, the purity of the original gases, and the pressure and temperature at which the synthesis is effected.Although many difficulties were encountered in constructing a commercial catalyst unit capable of withstanding the necessary pressure and temperature, the process was eventually brought to a commercial stage in Germany in 1913.According to a statement published in the German press, the production of ammonium sulphate by the Hater process increased from 30,000 tons in 1913 to 60,000 tons in 1914, and by the middle of 1915 the output of the original works amounted to about 150,000 tons. From 1916 the production was reckoned at 300,000 tons, and as further large plants were being erected in another part of Germany, it was estimated that the production in 1917 might amount to 500,000 tons. (Frankfurter Eandelsblatt, May 29th, 1916.) Figures of the same order were quoted in a confidential -tial report supplied to the Sub-Committee (See also Lunge, Coal Tar and Ammonia, 1916, Part 3, p. 1078), and serve to illustrate the extraordinary developments that have occurx-ed during the course of a few years, and more particularly during the war period.The details of the process have been jealously guarded, and as far as is known, no commercial installation has been erected outside Germany. It has been claimed, however, that the process is capable of producing ammonia and ammonium sulphate at a low cost, and that the power requirements per unit of nitrogen fixed are much smaller than those of any other fixation process. In view of these claims, and of the suitability of the process for an industrial country like Great Britain, information concerning the process has been sought from every available*source.A considerable amount of evidence has been collected by the Sub-Committee, and reference may be made at this stage to a detailed estimate of the capital and running costs of the first German plant supplied from an Allied source. Further details were also given by a chemist who stated that he had been concerned in the erection of a commercial plant and in its working for several months.The research work upon the Haber process carried out under the direction of the Experiments Sub-Committee at University College has also furnished valuable information, not only in respect of the technics of the process, but also in providing a basis for the examination of the various figures put forward.THE ECONOMICS OF THE PROCESS.The process considered as a whole consists mainly in the manufacture, compression and circulation of very large volumes of gases. About 70,000 cu. ft. of hydro-gen and 23,500 cu. ft. of nitrogen measured at normal temperature and pressure are required theoretically for every metric ton .of ammonia produced. The funda-mental importance of cheap raw materials, especiallyhydrogen of. the requisite degree of purity, is thus apparent. Other items entering largely into the economics of the process are the capital cost of the plant and the cost of repairs. The labour charges are probably small as very little handling of solids is involved, but skilled supervision is necessary on account of the special character of the process.As previously indicated, only a small percentage of ammonia is formed during a single circulation of the gas mixture through the catalyst, and the question as to the output of commercial catalyst units is one of considerable importance. Little information has been published on this point, although reference has been made to space-time-yields of the order of 0*25 and 1, i.e., outputs respectively equivalent to 0-25 kg. and 1 kg. of ammonia per hour per litre of catalyst space. (Bernthsen, 8th International Congress of Applied Chemistry, New York, 1912; Crossley, Journal of the Society of Chemical Industry, December 15th, 1914.) From the evidence available as to the sizes of the high -pressure units that are commercially practicable, it appears that a space-time-yield of 1 at a pressure of 150 atmospheres would correspond to the employment of about 450 catalyst units for an annual production of 16,000 tons of ammonia. If, however, a space-time-yield of the order of 5 were attainable commercially, oidy 90 catalyst units would be required for the same annual production.It is apparent, therefore, that a substantial increase in the space-time-yield will result not only in a corre-sponding reduction in the capital cost of the catalyst section, but also in a diminution of the charges for labour, superintendence, repairs, and depreciation. The above remarks thus indicate the influence that the factor of space-time-yield is likely to exert in future developments of the Haber process.HYDROGEN.The cost of hydrogen is -an outstanding item in the production costs of synthetic ammonia, and the Sirb-Committee has investigated in considerable detail the possibilities of all the processes adapted for the nianu-facture of pure hydrogen on a large scale.Certain quantities of by-product hydrogen arc obtained in this country, mainly in connection with the electrolytic alkali and cyanide industries. The quantity from the former industry is not very large when measured in terms of ammonia, and the figures available as regards the cyanide industry indicate that the by-product hydrogen from this source is also insufficient for the commercial manufacture of ammonia on a large scale. Similar observations also apply to the hydrogen available from the fermentation process for making acetone which has been established in this country since the outbreak of war. It seems clear from the evidence under consideration that the installation of the synthetic ammonia industry in this country on a substantial scale would necessitate the laying down of ad hoc hydrogen plant.The merits of the four following methods of making pure hydrogen in bulk have been carefully examined :The Electrolytic Process.This process yields hydrogen of a high degree of purity with practically pure oxygen as a by-product. - A detailed investigation of the various figures available for electrolytic hydrogen plants has shown that the capital cost for small-scale plants would be about  3,000 per unit having a capacity of 1,000 cubic feet per hour, and presumably lower for large plants. In addition, the necessary power plant would probably
t3 &apos;4 ainvolve an extra cost of, say,  1,600 to  1,700 per 1,000 cubic feet per hour, so that the total cost would be substantial as compared with that for other types of hydrogen plant.With regard to the production costs under pre-war conditions, it has been concluded that for an output of 5-85 cu. ft. of hydrogen per lew-hour and with energy costing, say, 0-185d. per k.w.-hour or  6\7perk.w.-year, the electrolytic plants under consideration are not likely to yield hydrogen for much less than 4s. 6d. per 1,000 cu. ft. Tor moderate sized plants the costs might vary from 4s. 6d. to 5s. per 1,000 cu. ft.These figures have not yet been realised in this country, and the Sub-Committee considers that they are on the low side. On the other hand, they do not allow any credit for the by-product oxygen, and even a low selling price for this gas would make an appreciable difference in the cost of manufacturing electrolytic hydrogen.The Steam-iron Process.This process is largely used in connection with the fat-hardening industry in this country and yields hydrogen containing a small percentage of carbon monoxide as an impurity. As is well known, the process involves the decomposition of steam by means of heated iron and the regeneration of the iron oxide that is formed by means of a gas, such as water-gas, containing carbon monoxide.Hydrogen was being produced in this country by the process for about 5s. per 1,000 cu. ft. and it is considered that under pre-war conditions the working costs for a large scale plant might be reduced to about 2s. 6d. per 1,000 cu. ft. with, say, an extra Gd. for overhead charges.The Linde Water-gas Process.This process was employed by the Badische Co. for their early Haber installation, but&apos; was subse-quently abandoned in favour of the catalytic method dealt with below. According to the Linde process, water-gas is freed from dust and then compressed and treated with water under pressure in order to remove the carbon dioxide. The compressed gas is passed into a liquefier in order to condense the carbon monoxide, the residual hydrogen containing only a small percentage of this gas and of nitrogen. The waste carbon monoxide is utilised as a power gas, and in the case of moderately large plants is sufficient to generate all the power required.Hydrogen was being produced in this country by the process for about 3s. per 1,000 cu. ft. It may be noted that an estimate put forward by the B.A.M.A.G. (Berlin) for a plant having an output of 500 cu. m. of hydrogen per hour quoted a running cost of Is. 9d. per 1,000 cu. ft. of hydrogen based upon pre-war prices.The Water-gas Catalytic Process.This hydrogen process, which was patented by Mond and Langer as early as 1888, was developed commercially by the Badische Co., and is used on a large scale at their works at Ludwigshafen. It depends upon the fact that carbon monoxide in the presence of steam and a suitable catalyst is converted into carbon dioxide, with the liberation of an equal volume of hydrogen from the steam. In practice, water-gas is used as a source of carbon monoxide, and after being freed from dust it is mixed with steam and admitted to the catalyst where the reaction proceeds at a com-paratively low temperature, say, 400o to 500o C.The reaction is exothermic and the heat evolved is sufficient to cover losses by radiation and conduction if a good system of heat regeneration is employed. The gases containing appreciable quantities of steam leave the catalyst chamber at a temperature well above 100o G, and if this heat is rendered available in inter-changers, water may be sprayed into the entering water-gas, thus economising in the use of live steam. The composition of the cool gas after the steam has been removed is approximately as follows : Hydrogen 65 per cent., carbon dioxide 30 per cent., nitrogen 4 per cent., and carbon monoxide 1 to 2 per cent.The method of purification in operation at Ludwigs-hafen prior to the war is reported to have been as follows : The carbon dioxide was removed by pressure washing, the impure hydrogen gas being compressed to about 30 atmospheres and treated with water under pressure. It was also stated that about 50 per cent, of the energy required for pumping the water could be recovered from the high pressure water by means of a Pelton wheel. The traces of carbon monoxide still remaining in the hydrogen were then removed in a further purifier containing ammoniacal cuprous chloride solution of such a strength as not to attack the iron vessel. The purifier actually in use was being worked at a pressure of 200 atmospheres, as hydrogen at this pressure was required in the synthetic ammonia plant.The following figures concerning the capital and production costs of the process have been supplied to the Sub-Committee:capital cost. The cost of an installation capable of producing 500 cu. m. of hydrogen per hour was quoted at  27,000 by the Badische Co. prior to the war.Production Costs.  The cost of production was stated by the Badische Co. to amount to Is. 9d. per 1,000 cu. ft. of hydrogen,-exclusive of depreciation and of interest on capital.If an allowance is made for depreciation at the rate of 10 per cent., the production cost would be equivalent to about 2s. 1- 5d. per 1,000 cu. ft. exclusive of interest, or, say, 2s. 4d. per 1,000 cu. ft. inclusive of interest at the rate of 5 per cent.Probable Cost of Hydrogen.It is difficult to arrive at a safe minimum value for the capital and production costs of a large scale hydro-gen plant in this country, particularly when regard is had to the fact that hydrogen of a high degree of purity is necessary for the manufacture of synthetic ammonia. . &apos;In view of the fact that water-gas can be made very cheaply, namely, for about 8d. to Wd. per 1,000 cu. ft. with coke at  1 per ton, it would appear that the use of this gas as a raw material for the manufacture of hydrogen on a large scale offers considerable possi-bilities in the direction of a comparatively inexpensive product. It is also apparent that a process such as the water-gas catalytic process, which is operated at a lower temperature than other contact processes and is claimed in practice to require only about 1-1 cu. m. of water-gas per cu. m. of hydrogen produced, as corn-pared with from 2 to 4 cu. m. in the case of other water-gas hydrogen processes, has distinct advantages. In the opinion of the Sub-Committee, this process appears to be the most promising of those hitherto developed for the manufacture of pure hydrogen on a large scale&apos; at a low cost.capital cost-With regard to the capital cost of hydrogen plant, it is not certain that the figure quoted by the Badische Co. includes the cost of the requisite buildings. It has therefore been considered desirable to make &quot;an allowance of  3,000 for this contingency, and the figure of  30,000 for a unit plant having an output of 500 cu. m. of compressed hydrogen per hour has been provisionally adopted by the Sub-Committee.A plant comprising 10 such units, two being in reserve, would have an output of about 3,020 metric tons of hydrogen per year of 50 weeks. Apart from losses of hydrogen during the synthesis, the plant is of sufficient capacity for the production of over 17,100 metric tons of ammonia, corresponding to a capital outlay of about  17&apos;54 per metric ton of ammonia per annum in respect of the hydrogen section of an ammonia factory.Production Costs. The Sub-Committee, after a careful consideration of the evidence available, has come to the conclusion that when allowance is made for contingencies, the cost of manufacturing hydrogen on a large scale in this country under pre-war conditions by means of a process such as the water-gas catalytic process, would amount to about 2s. 6d. per 1,000 cu. ft. delivered under compression to the catalyst unit, and this figure has been adopted.   It is
taken as inclusive of power requirements at, say 0&apos;25d. per k,w.-houT, and of depreciation at the i&apos;ate of 10 per cent, on the cost of the hydrogen plant.If an allowance is made for the loss of about 10 per cent, by volume of the mixed gases during tho synthesis, approximately 77,000 cu. ft. of hydrogen measured at normal temperature and pressure are required per metric ton of ammonia produced. The cost of this material, namely,  9-625 per metric ton of ammonia, represents by far the largest item in the total cost of production.Observations.The water-gas catalytic hydrogen process involves the separation of large quantities of carbon dioxide as a by-product for which a market might possibly be found in various industries,The utilisation of the carbon dioxide was con-templated by the Badische Co. just prior to the war in connection with a process for fixing synthetic ammonia without the direct use of sulphuric acid. Further in-formation concerning this process is given later in this section.NITROGEN.The costs involved in separating nitrogen from the air by means of modern liquefaction plants are well established on account of the extensive scale upon which such plants have been employed.The following figures are given as an example, and are based upon the working of a fairly large liquid air plant of the Claude type used at a works abroad.Capital Costs.The pre-war capital cost of a plant comprising three units each having a capacity of 800 cu. m. of nitrogen per hour, one unit being in reserve, with compressors and motors is quoted at about  38,000, the necessary buildings costing an additional  5,000.The output of this plant is about 2 metric tons of uitrogen per hour, or 16,800 tons per year of 50 weeks. Apart from losses of nitrogen during the synthesis, the plant is of sufficient capacity for the production of about 20,400 metric tons of ammonia, corresponding to a capital outlay of about  2 -11 per metric ton of ammonia per annum in respect of the nitrogen section of an ammonia factory.From this figure and from others under review, it is clear that cost of the nitrogen plant is only a small proportion of the total cost of a large installation for manufacturing synthetic ammonia.Production Costs.The working costs of the above-mentioned plant, based upon pre-war prices, are given as follows:Per	Per1,000	1,000cu. m.	cu. ft.A&apos;.&apos;	d.1-538	0-5231-020	0-3500-903	0-3065-531	1-8819-004	3-000i	Labour      -Materials (caustic soda, etc.) Upkeep   of  buildings  and plant      -Amortization of  plant at10 per cent.    -Total (exclusive  of power) -The power requirements amount to about 437 e.h.p.-hours or 326 k.w.-hours per 1,000 cu. m. of nitrogen. If the cost of energy is taken at, say, 0 - %5d. per k.w.-hour, the cost of production, exclusive of interest on capital, would amount to about 15 -8s. per 1,000 kcu. m., or 5&apos;37(i. per 1,000 cu. ft. of nitrogen.Probable Cost of Nitrogen.Capital Costs. The Sub-Committee has taken the capital cost of the nitrogen section of a large-scale ammonia factory at  2-1 per metric ton of ammonia produced per annum, exclusive of losses of nitrogen.Production Costs.   After a consideration of the various figures under review, the Sub-Committee has come to the conclusion that 6(Z. per 1,000 cu. ft. of nitrogen is a safe maximum value for the working-costs of a large-scale plant, inclusive of power at, say, 0&apos;25(Z. per k,w.-hour, and of an allowance of 10 per cent, for depreciation of the plant.If an allowance is made for a loss of about 10 per cent, by volume of the mixed gases during the synthesis, approximately 26,000 cu. ft. of nitrogen measured at normal temperature and pressure are required per metric ton of ammonia produced. The cost of this material, namely,  0-65 per metric ton of ammonia, is only a small item in the total, cost of production.It may be noted that the above figures do not include any credit for the by-product oxygen from the nitrogen plant. A very appreciable quantity of this by-product would be obtained in the working of a large-scale plant, amounting to over 6,000 cu. ft. per metric ton of ammonia produced. If a market could be secured, even a moderate selling price for the oxygen would enable a substantial reduction to be made in the cost of manufacturing synthetic ammonia.POWER REQUIREMENTS.The Haber process is usually credited with a smaller consumption of energy per unit of nitrogen fixed than any other fixation process. There appears to be practically no published information as to the precise power requirements, but a certain amount of evidence has been collected by the Sub-Committee, and this will now be dealt with.The figure of 1-5 k.w.-hours per kilogramme of nitrogen fixed, equivalent to 1,235 k.w.-hours per metric ton of ammonia, has been quoted as representing the power requirements of the catalyst section of the plant. Evidence obtained as the result of the research work carried out under the direction of the Experiments Sub-Committee tends to show that the power require-ments for the heating of the catalyst and gases, and for the circulation of the latter in a system containing an efficient heat regenerator, are of the order mentioned above.Information based upon the working of the first Haber installation of the Badische Co. places the power requirements at 1,131 k.w.-hours per metric ton of ammonia, an additional 88 k.w.-hours being utilised for electric lighting purposes. The installation in question comprised a Linde nitrogen plant and a Linde water-gas hydrogen plant, and the waste carbon monoxide from the hydrogen plant would, at least, have sufficed for the power requirements of the latter. No indication is given as to the manner in which the power require-ments of the nitrogen plant and gas compressors were met, and energy amounting to 1,131 k.w.-hours appears to be insufficient for these requirements and for the needs of the catalyst section, as will be shown later. On the other hand, the figure is of substantially the same order as that previously given, and may possibly relate to the requirements of the catalyst section only.A figure for another early Haber installation which relied upon compressed hydrogen obtained in cylinders from an outside factory, indicates that the power require-ments were of the order of 0.5 e.h.p.-hour per kilo-gramme of ammonia, equivalent to 373 k.w.-hours per metric ton of ammonia. The information is lacking in any further details, and the figure cannot be regarded as adequate in view of the foregoing considerations.The influence of the cost of energy cannot be dis-regarded in dealing with the production costs of synthetic ammonia, and it is necessary, therefore, to investigate the probable order of the power require-ments of a complete ammonia factory to facilitate the formation of tentative conclusions.Catalyst Section.From the evidence already given, an allowance of say 1,250 k.w.-hours per metric ton of ammonia appears to be reasonable for the heating of the catalyst and the gases, and for the circulation of the latter,
Compression Plant.Information has been obtained by the Sub-Com -mittee from a reliable source concerning the power requirements of large-scale high-pressure compressors. Assuming that the hydrogen and nitrogen are delivered to the compressors at atmospheric pressure, the con-sumption of energy for compressing, say, 100,000 cu. ft. of the mixed gas per hour to about 150 atmospheres would be of the order of 860 k.w.-hours. This quantity of gas is equivalent to approximately 1 metric ton of ammonia after allowing a loss of about 10 per cent, of the gas during the synthesis.Nitrogen Plant.The power requirements of a large-scale nitrogen plant have already been dealt with. On the basis of the figures previously given, an output of 26,000 cu. ft. of nitrogen per hour, equivalent to a metric ton of ammonia, if allowance is made for losses during the synthesis, represents a consumption of energy of the order of 240 k.w,-hours.Hydrogen Plant.It is difficult to estimate with any degree of relia-bility the power requirements of a hydrogen plant of the water-gas catalytic type. The water-gas and catalyst sections, however, involve the use of pumps and blowers for circulating the steam, etc., and the water and cuprous chloride purifiers involve the use of compressors. The gas is treated in the water purifier at a pressure of about 30 atmospheres, and this pressure would probably suffice in ordinary cases for the satisfactory working of &quot;the cuprous chloride purifier, although it appears to have been found con-venient to carry out this stage of the purification at a pressure of about 200 atmospheres on account of the requirements of the ammonia section of the plant. The work of compression up to 30 atmospheres (pro-portional to log. 30) is nearly 70 per cent, of the total work of compression from atmospheric pressure up to, say, 150 atmospheres (proportional to log. 150), so that the additional consumption of energy involved in meeting the requirements of the ammonia plant is not very largely in excess of that required for what may be termed the normal working of the hydrogen plant.For an output of, say, 77,000 cu. ft. of hydrogen per hour, equivalent to 1 metric ton of ammonia after allowing for losses during the synthesis, the power requirements for compression to about 150 atmosphere-pheres would be of the order of 660 k.w.-hours. In the absence of further evidence, an allowance of the same order may be made for the pumps, blowers, and high-pressure water pump, although, as previously men-tioned, about 50 per cent, of the energy required for the latter is stated to be recoverable from the high-pressure water by means of a Pelton wheel.The above figures therefore indicate that the total power requirements of a water-gas catalytic hydrogen plant delivering purified gas at a pressure of 150 atmospheres may be of the order of 1,300 k.w.-hours per metric ton of ammonia.Total Power Requirements.The approximate requirements of an ammonia factory producing 1 metric ton of ammonia per hour with allowance for losses of the mixed gases during the synthesis appear therefore to be of the following order:K.w.-hours per metric ton NIL,.(a) Hydrogen plant, delivering  corn-pressed gas     ....   1,300 (6) Manufacture of nitrogen     -     -     240(c) Compression of, say, 26,000 cubicfeet of nitrogen to about 150 atmospheres    ....     220(d) Catalyst section of ammonia plant -   1,250or, a total of 3,010 k.w.-hours, equivalent to approxi-mately 0 - 35 k.w.-year of 8,500 hours per metric ton of ammonia, or about 0&quot;42 k.w.-year per metric ton of combined nitrogen in the form of ammonia.It should be noted that certain requirements, such as those involved in the circulation of cooling water for the compressors, and in the recovery of the ammonia as an anhydrous liquid or a concentrated solution, are not included in the above estimate. As will be apparent, the figures are of a tentative character and are put forward with reserve.Observations and Conclusions.The figure already adopted for the cost of hydrogen is inclusive of the cost of compression to about 150 at-mospheres, and that for the cost of nitrogen is inclusive of the cost of the energy required for its manufacture. The power requirements for compressing the nitrogen and &quot;for the catalyst section of the ammonia plant still remain to be accounted for, and after a careful consideration of the evidence available, the Sub-Committee has adopted a provisional figure of 1,500 k.w.-hours per metric ton of ammonia produced.It may be pointed out that, apart from the require-ments of the catalyst section of the ammonia plant, the employment of electrical energy could be avoided. For example, the blowers, pumps, compressors and the like could be driven by gas engines or by steam engines supplied from the steam boilers required for the water-gas hydrogen plant.CAPITAL COST OF SYNTHETIC AMMONIA FACTORY.The first set of figures that came under considera-tion by the Sub-Committee was in the form of a preliminary estimate prepared by the Chairman for another report. The estimate was based, among other considerations, upon a published statement that the fixed investment for ammonia production by the cyanamide process may be as low as one and a half times the market value of the annual product compared with three times for the Haber process. (Metallurgical and Chemical Engineering, 1915, 13, pp. 309-14.) Taking into account the approximate cost of cyananiide ammonia plant, hydrogen plant, and nitrogen plant, the following provisional figures were put forward for the capital cost of a large-scale ammonia factory having a capacity of over 30,000 metric tons of ammonia per annum:NH3 per metric ton per annum. Hydrogen plant with spares - - ,14.95 Nitrogen plant with spares - - 0-92 Buildings and accessories for gas plants 2&quot;58 Catalyst section, compressors and ac-cessories......55&quot; 38Buildings for catalyst section, land,etc........6&quot; 15Total -     -     -  70 &quot;98say,  80, equivalent to  97 &quot;1 per metric ton of com-bined nitrogen per annum in the form of ammonia.Since the cost of the catalyst section depends very largely upon the number of units required for a given output, i.e., upon the precise space-tiuie-yield attained, it was recognized that the figures given above were of an approximate order only. They have, however, served a useful purpose in providing a basis for dealing with the evidence that has come to hand from time to time.For example, two sets of figures stated to be based upon the first commercial Haber installation were received from an Allied source. According to one figure the capital cost was given as follows, without any details in respect of the sections of the plant:N H:, per metric ton per annum. Buildings, railway, etc. - - - 16 05 Plant.......51-30Total -   -     -     -      67-35equivalent to  81-7 per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum in the form of ammonia.The second set of figures from the same source was in the form of a very detailed estimate of the capital cost of a factoiy for making 36,000 metric tons of synthetic ammonium sulphate per annum, equivv
lent to about 9,COO metric tons of ammonia, The ustallation in question included a Linde nitrogen plant, a Linde water-gas hydrogen plant, sulphate plant, storage for the gases, for the concentrated nmmonia and for sulphuric ncid, and many other Uiiins, the cost of each being specified separately. After deducting the cost of the sulphate and acid-storage plant, etc., the figures indicated the following capital cost for the ammonia factory :NH3 per met no. ton per annum.Catalyst section -     -     -     -     - 10-22Buildings for catalyst section - - 1-91 Hydrogen, nitrogen, and other plant and accessories       -     -     -     - 33&apos; 0(5Buildings for other plant, etc.    -     - 11-13Total .... 56-02equivalent to  68-73 per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum in the form of ammonia. Special reference may be made to the cost of the catalyst section as indicated in the above figures.A tentative figure was then put forward as tho result of evidence obtained from the research work which is being carried out under the direction of the Experiments Sub - Committee. The evidence concerned the possible output of a catalyst unit, and hence the number required for a plant having an output of, say, 30,000 metric tons of ammonia per annum.. Basing the cost of the units upon that of other high - pressure furnace plant, the evidence indicated the possibility of reducing the capital cost of the catalyst section to  5-88 per &quot;metric ton of ammonia per annum. A revision of the previous figures upon this basis resulted in another tentative estimate for a complete factory amounting to about  30 per metric ton of ammonia per annum.The only other definite figures under review were supplied by the chemist concerned in the erection of another early Haber installation for making synthetic ammonium sulphate on a scale equivalent to 13,500 metric tons of ammonia per annum. The installa-tion referred to did not include a hydrogen plant, the gas being obtained in cylinders from another factory, and the estimate may be incomplete in respect of other requirements of an ad hoc ammonia factory. An analysis of the figures, which showed some anomalies, indicated that the capital cost of the catalyst section amounted to about  10-55 per metric ton of ammonia per annum. The informant &apos;s figures when taken in conjunction with the cost of a water-gas catalytic hydrogen plant of the proper capacity indicate a capital cost of  33 - 88 per metric ton of ammonia per annum for a complete factory.CAPITAL COST OF SYNTHETIC AMMONIA FACTORY.Summary of Evidence.	  metric ton per		annum.

There is no doubt that the costs incurred in establishing the process upon a successful commercial basis were very large. Judging, however, by the course of develop-ment in many other industries, it is reasonably safe to assume that the experience gained with the earlier-plants has led to a substantial reduction in the cost of later plants.In view of the above considerations, and of the general lack of first-hand information concerning the more modern Haber plant, the Sub-Committee has experienced difficulty in arriving at an estimate as to the probable capital cost of a complete ammonia factory on the basis of pre-war conditions in this country. As the result, however, of a critical analysis of all the figures under review, the Sub-Committee is inclined to the opinion that a reasonable upper figure for the capital cost of a factory capable of producing say 15,000 metric tons of ammonia per annum might be approximately as follows, allowing a margin of 10 per cent, in respect of the capacities of the hydrogen and nitrogen sections:NH3 per metric, ton per annum. Hydrogen section with compressors and&quot;buildings: 1 1 at,  17-54 - - - 19-3 Nitrogen section with buildings : 1:1 at 2-1 -...... 2-3Catalyst section with accessories and buildings...... 10&apos;0Water supply, pumps and storage forliquor....... 5-0Sundry equipment and buildings  -     - 3-4-   Total     -     -     - 40-0equivalent to  48-56 per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum in the form of pure ammonia liquor.If the above estimate is modified upon the basis of the evidence dealing with the output of the catalyst units, a tentative capital cost of about  36 per metric ton of ammonia or  13 - 7 per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum is indicated. The lowest figures under consideration point to a possible cost of the order of  30 per metric ton of ammonia per annum.Some uncertainty attaches to the above figures and although they are based upon the best information available, the Sub-Committee desires to emphasize that they are given with reserve.It should be noted that the estimate given above does not include any allowance for electrical generating plant. The previous observations on the probable order of the power requirements indicate that a total supply of about 5,000 k.w. might be necessary for an ammonia factory having an annual output of 15,000 tons. For the purposes of the above estimate it has been assumed that the electrical energy could be obtained from an existing public supply station, If it were necessary to meet the whole of the power require-ments electrically and to instal an ad hoe power station for the purpose, the additional capital expenditure involved would amount to about  90.000, equivalent to  6 per metric ton of ammonia per annum.PRODUCTION COSTS OP SYNTHETIC AMMONIA.Several sets of figures for the cost of making synthetic ammonia have been under consideration.A preliminary estimate prepared for another report was based upon a published statement con-cerning the yield of a catalyst unit (Bernthsen, Eighth International Congress of Applied Chemistry, New York, 1912), from which the approximate number of units and the labour requirements for a factory of moderate capacity were deduced.   An estimate was

Taking approximate values for the cost of hydrogen and nitrogen, inclusive of all charges in respect of the gas plants, the following figures were arrived at:NHS per metric ton.Hydrogen and nitrogen -Power for catalyst section at 0&apos;2(Z, perk.w.-hour......Labour (other than for gas plants) -Repairs (other than for gas plants) at 2 per cent, on total capital outlay -Superintendence    -General expenses.....Fixed charge? : offices, salariesDepreciation (other than for gas plants) at 10 per cent, on cost of catalyst plant, and 2&apos;5 per cent, on buildings -Interest at 5 per cent, on catalyst section io-3;$0-44 0-461-23 0-06 0-31 0-315-69 3-08Total-   21-91equivalent to  26-6 per metric ton of combined nitrogen.According to a statement attributed to the Ba-dische Co. the cost of producing a metric ton of combined nitrogen in the form of ammonia liquor is about  25 - 75, equivalent to  21 - 2 per metric ton of ammonia. No evidence is available as to the nature of the charges included in this figure.Another set of figures stated to be based upon the first commercial Haber installation was given in con-siderable detail, but cannot be set out on the lines previously adopted as the figures for wages, maintenance and repairs, depreciation, etc. are not itemised in respect of the different sections of the plant. The following summary, however, indicates the nature of the costs :NH3per metric ton.Salaries and wages Coke, steam, water and lubricants -Power (1,131 k.w.-hours) Electric lighting (88 k.w.-hours)  -Maintenance, including wages Catalyst      -Depreciation at 5 per cent, on buildings and 10 per cent, on plant -General charges and contingencies 2-63 7-69 1-42 0-46 3-02 0-286-01 0-6522-16ton of combinedTotal    -equivalent  to  26-9 per metric nitrogen in the form of ammonia.A tentative estimate based upon the results of the research work previously referred to was then put forward, the figures being as follows :NH3 per metric ton.Hydrogen, nitrogen and drying Power for catalyst section at 0-2^. pc:k.w.-hour.....Labour (other than for gas plants) Repairs (other than for gas plants) Superintendence  -General expenses -Fixed charges      ....

According to the information given, the hydrogen was purchased from another factory in cylinders at a pressure of about 150 atmospheres, and the purchase price, namely, Is. per kg., is approximately equivalent to 2s, 6d. per 1,000 cu. ft,, the figure adopted by the Sub-Oommittee. The nitrogen was made by a liquid air plant, and the sale of the by-product oxygen obtained from the nitrogen plant was placed to the credit of the ammonia factory. It is not clear, however, under which item this credit is allowed for in the figures given below. It may be noted that the estimate deals with a factory having a capacity of over 50,000 metric tons of ammo-nium sulphate per annum.NHS per metric ton.Hydrogen at Is. per kg., and nitrogenat 0-03s. per kg.      ....     10-057Wages.......0-133Power at  6-25 per k.w.-year of 8,400hours......0-273Superintendence,    general    expenses,salaries, etc.  (No allowance indicated)  Repairs, contact material, etc. - - 0-011 Depreciation at 2 per cent, and interest at 5 per cent, on buildings - - - 0-065 Depreciation at 10 per cent, and interest at 5 per cent, on plant     -     -     -      1 - 944Total    ....     12-483say,  12-5 equivalent to  15-17 per metric ton of combined nitrogen in the form of ammonia.The item for repairs, based upon a few mouths&apos; experience only of a section of a new plant, must be regarded as altogether inadequate, while the power requirements of an ad hoc plant are probably largely in excess of the allowance made above. Having regard also to the highly technical character of the process and to the necessity for skilled supervision, an allow-ance would have to be made for superintendence, etc.PRODUCTION COSTS OF SYNTHETIC AMMONIA.Summary of Evidence.	  per metric ton.

The figure adopted for the cost of the nitrogen cam be regarded as a safe one, but some uncertainty attaches to that for the cost of the hydrogen as the water-gas catalytic process has never been carried out in this country. In the opinion of the Sub-Committee, however, there are reasonable grounds for believing that a figure of 2s. 6d. per 1,000 cu. ft. could be realised in this country on the basis of pre-war conditions with a hydrogen plant of a sufficiently large scale.Other items also characterised by uncertainty are those relating to the power requirements, depreciation,
and repairs. Tentative figures relating to the first two items have already heen put forward, but accurate figures for the cost of repairs can only be arrived at as the iesu.lt of several years&apos; working. It seems pro-bable, however, that a substantial allowance is necessary in the case of such a special high-pressure process. On general principles, a percentage of, say, 5 to 10 per cent, on the capital cost of the catalyst section might be taken, and an allowance of 10 per cent, should be a reasonably safe maximum for the cost of repairs.After a careful examination of the various figures under review, the following estimate, based upon the most reasonable items of the evidence, is tentatively put forward by the Sub-Oommittee in respect of the production costs of a factory having an output of, say, 15,000 metric tons of ammonia per annum. Allowance is made in the figures for a loss of about 10 per cent, by volume of the mixed gases during the synthesis, and the figures taken for the cost of hydrogen and nitrogen are inclusive of all the manufacturing costs and of the power requirements of the gas plants.NH3 per metric ton.Hydrogen : 77,000 cu. ft. at 2s.

If an allowance is made for this item at the rate of 5 per cent., the production cost becomes  17 - 57 per metric ton of ammonia.The Sub-Committee is of the opinion that the above estimate is probably on the low side, and that hi actual practice the production costs, exclusive of interest, might be of the order of  17 per metric ton of ammonia, equivalent to  20 &quot;64 per metric ton of combined nitrogen in the form of pure ammonia liquor (20 to 25 per cent. NIT,).In the event of the whole of the power require-nients of the process being met electrically from an ad hoc steam turbo-electric station of about 5,000 k.w. capacity operating at a load factor of, say, 95 per cent., the cost of energy under pre-war conditions with coal at 7s. 6c?. per ton would amount to 0- 2d. per k.w.-hour, or with coal at 10s. per ton to 0&apos;24d. per k.w.-hourAttention may again be directed to the vital im-portance of cheap hydrogen of the necessary degree of purity. The tentative estimate given above indicates that the item for hydrogen may account for over 60 per cent, of the total cost of manufacturing the synthetic ammonia, while every increase or reduction in the cost of hydrogen to the extent of Od. per 1,000 cu. ft. will affect the total production costs by  1 - 925 per metric ton of ammonia or  2-337 per metric ton of combined nitrogen.AMMONIUM SULPHATE PROM SYNTHETIC AMMONIA.The normal industrial demand for pure strong ammoiia liquor would not suffice to absorb the output of a large-scale synthetic ammonia factory, and the main outlet for the product would have to be bought for in the fertiliser market.Evidence relating to the cost of fixing synthetic ammonia was reviewed in a previous section, and figures were given for the probable capital and working costs of a large-scale sulphate factory. (Section II.) The overall costs involved in the manufacture of synthetic ammonium sulphate by the Haber process will now be considered.Overall Capital Cost of Factory.The figure adopted by the Sub-Committee for the capital cost of a large-scale sulphate and sulphuric acid plant was  3 per long ton of sulphate (24 - 5 per cent. NH3) per annum, or  14-63 per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum in the form of sulphate (Section II., p. 231).On the basis of the probable upper cost of a synthetic ammonia factory, namely,  48-56 per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum, the overall cost of a large-scale ammonium sulphate factory would amount to  48-56 -h  14-63 rz:  63-19 per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum, or  13 - 01 per metric ton of sulphate (25 per cent. NH3) per annum.Overall Production Costs.The figure adopted by the Sub-Committee for the cost ox fixing a pure strong ammonia was  1 - 775 perlong ton of sulphate (24 - 5 per cent. NH3), or  8165 per metric ton of combined nitrogen in the form of sulphate (Section II).On the basis of the tentative production cost of synthetic ammonia, namely,  18&apos;90 per metric ton of combined nitrogen, the overall cost of manufacturing synthetic sulphate would amount to  18^90-f- 8^65=  27&apos;55 per metric ton of combined nitrogen, or  5 67 per metric ton of sulphate (25 percent. NH3), exclusive of interest on capital.An allowance for interest at the rate of 5 per cent, on the overall capital cost would increase the figures to  30 - 71 and  6 - 32 respectively.If the cost of the ammonia is taken at the &quot;probable&quot; figure of  17 per metric ton, or  20-64 per metric ton of combined nitrogen, the overall manufacturing cost of synthetic sulphate would amount to  20 - 64 -f-  8 - 65  29 - 29 per metric ton of combined nitrogen, or  6&apos;03 per metric ton of sulphate (25 per cent. NH3), exclusive of interest on capital.Allowing as before for the latter item, the cost would be increased to  6 - 68 per metric ton of sulphate (25 per cent. NH3).   .Observations.From a consideration of the above figures it appears that the factory costs of synthetic ammonium sulphate, exclusive of interest on capital, might be of the order of  6 or perhaps as low as about  515 per metric ton in the case of a large-scale factory in this country., and upon the basis of pre-war conditions. It may be re-called that the Badische Co. claim to be able to produce
synthetic sulphate at an inclusive cost of  ii per metric ton.The pre-war market price of ammonium sulphate in this country (average 1911-13) amounted to  13&apos;83 per long ton, or  13 * 61 per metric ton.Fixing Ammonia without direct use of Sulphuric Acid.According to information supplied to the Sub-Oommittee, the Badische Oo. were making large-scale preparations prior to the war for fixing synthetic ammonia without the direct use of sulphuric acid. The process contemplated involved the decomposi-tion of gypsum in suspension by the conjoint action of ammonia and carbon dioxide, thus providing an outlet for the large quantities of the latter gas obtained as a by-product in the manufacture of hydrogen from water-gas. The decomposition is stated to proceed quite smoothly even on a large scale, butdifficulties were encountered in the filtration of the finely divided precipitate of calcium carbonate. The information available indicates that the Badische Oo. succeeded in overcoming these difficulties by the em-ploymeut of slime filters of a type used in the gold-, mining industry.No evidence has been received as to the costs in-&apos; volved in the process. It appears probable, however, that a process of the kind in question involving the utilisation of a by-product and a cheap raw material, might reduce the cost of fixing as compared with the standard method, and thus place synthetic sulphate in a still more favourable position than that indicated above.The utilisation of synthetic ammonia for the manu-facture of nitric acid and nitrates by means of the ammonia oxidation process is dealt with in Sections VII. and VIII.
SECTION Y.CALCIUM CYANAMIDE (NiTROLIM).Calcium cyanamide is produced by the - direct combination of nitrogen gas with finely ground calcium carbide at a temperature of about 1000o C. The reaction is exothermic, and when once the absorp-tion of nitrogen has begun it is unnecessary to supply further energy for heating purposes as the evolution of heat is sufficient to maintain the materials at the reaction temperature. Care has to be taken to prevent any appreciable rise in the temperature, as the reaction is a reversible one and the cyanamide is decomposed into carbide and free nitrogen at elevated tempera-tures. The process has been described in some detail in literature and it will suffice for present purposes to deal with those technical aspects having a direct bearing upon manufacturing operations.The theoretical nitrogen content of pure calcium cyanamide amounts to 35 per cent. If pure calcium carbide could be fully saturated with nitrogen, the resulting mixture of cyanamide and carbon would contain about 30 per cent. In practice, however, the material produced from commercial carbide only contains about 20 per cent, of combined nitrogen. In order to convert the material into a form suitable for the fertiliser market, it is first crushed and ground, then treated with water to decompose impurities such as free carbide and phosphide, andto hydrate or partly hydrate the free lime, and finally treated with mineral oil to prevent the formation of dust. Owing to the increase in weight resulting from the after-treatment of the raw cyanamide, its nitrogen content is reduced to about 16 per cent.The value of Nitrolim for agricultural purposes depends upon the fact that, under suitable conditions, its combined nitrogen is liberated in the soil, with the simultaneous production of calcium carbonate, and converted into a form capable of assimilation by plant life.The rapid development of the cyanamide industry, which was only started on a commercial scale in 1906-1907, is clear when it is stated that the estimated world&apos;s output for 1910 amounted to about 30,000 tons, for 1911 to 54,000 tons, and for 1913 to 223,600 tons! There has been an enormous development of the industry in Germany since the outbreak of war, and it has recently been stated that the works in that country alone now have a capacity of 600,000 tons per annum.The manufacture of cyanamide involves two distinct stages :(1) The production of calcium carbide, and (2) The conversion of the carbide into cyanamide, and these stages are dealt with separately below.THE MANUFACTURE OE CALCIUM CARBIDE.The manufacture of calcium carbide was established on a large scale prior to the war, the world&apos;s pi&apos;oduc-tion in 1913 amounting to over 300,000 tons. Carbide is manufactured in Great Britain, but only on a com-paratively small scale. It may be noted, however, that an additional factory has been erected during the war period to produce about 12,000 tons per annum.The broad features of the process, which consists in fusing a mixture of lime and anthracite or coke in an electric furnace, are well known, and it is unneces-sary to describe the details of manufacture in view of the publications on the subject (e.g., Bingham, The Manufacture of Carbide of Calcium, 1916).Size of Furnaces and of Factory.Modern developments have favoured the use of large furnaces from which the molten carbide can be periodically tapped, thus allowing the process to be carried out in a continuous manner.It may be interesting to mention that a factory has recently been designed to employ furnaces of 6,000 k.w. capacity, and that another recently erected carbide factory, supplied with a 3-phase A.C. of 25 periods at 10,000 volts, comprises furnaces of 3,500 k.w. capacity working at a power factor of 0-89. The output of this factory amounts to 21,000 tons of raw carbide per annum, or about 20,000 tons of high-grade lighting and welding carbide, thus indi-cating the production of about 5 per cent, of dust during the crushing of the raw product.According to reliable information, a factory having an output of 20,000 tons of calcium carbide per annum is about the minimum size for economy in manufacture.Raw Materials: Quality, Quantities and Prices.The raw materials required for the manufacture of carbide are limestone, anthracite or coke, and coal,and excellent supplies of these materials of a quality well suited for the process are available in Great Britain.It may be noted that in many cases the Scandinavian-scandinavian carbide factories import their coal and anthracite from this couutry and their lime from France; in some instances, however, local supplies of limestone are utilised.Limestone .or Lime. The limestone used in the manufacture of high-grade carbide must be of good quality, containing from 97 to 98 per cent, of calcium carbonate, the chief impurities to be avoided being magnesia, alumina, and silica. Some latitude appears to be allowable as regards the extent to which the different impurities can be present within the limit specified. It has been stated, however, that the maximum quantities of impurities permissible should be about 0&quot;5 per cent, of magnesia, 015 per cent, of alumina and iron oxide, 0 - 01 per cent, of phosphoric acid (P-iOj), about 1 to 1 1 2 per cent, of silica, and only traces of sulphur, corresponding roughly to a limestone of 97 to 98 per cent, purity (Bingham, p. 106).Figures based upon the best modern practice in the manufacture of carbide for conversion into cyanamide indicate that approximately 1*7 metric tons of limestone and 0-2 to 03 metric ton of coal for burning the limestone are required per metric ton of carbide produced. It appears, however, that the waste gases from the- carbide furnaces, which are rich in carbon monoxide and hydrogen, can be em-ployed for firing the limekilns, thus enabling the use of coal to be avoided (Engineering, 1914, Yol. 98, p. 352). Figures from another source indicate that 0 9 to 0*95 metric ton of lime is required for the production of a metric ton of carbide suitable for lighting purposes.The Sub-Committee, from the information at its disposal, considers that a figure of 0 - 95 metric ton of
lime may be taken as representing the requirements per metric ton of carbide, and this has been adopted.The cost of the lime will be determined to a con-siderable extent by the situation of the factory in respect of the source of supply. Having regard to the prices at which large quantities of high-grade lime were obtainable in this country prior to the war, and to the pre-war rates for freight, the Sub-Committee considers that the cost of lime, delivered at a favourably situated cyanamide factory, should not exceed  0-75 per metric ton, and this figure has been adopted.Anthracite or Colte. High quality anthracite con-taining not more than about 5 per cent, of ash is required for making lighting or welding carbide, but coke of similar quality can also be employed. It is stated that coke presents some advantages over anthracite-cite, the furnaces stated-ting and working more easily when it is used, and the consumption of electrodes being considerably lower (Bingham, p. 90). On the other hand coke often contains a large quantity of moisture and more than 5 per cent, of ash, in addition to variable quantities of impurities such as phosphorus and sulphur, and the difficulty of obtaining adequate supplies of uniform quality is greater than in the case of anthracite. The Sub-Committee has information concerning the difficulties that have been experienced in the above connection at a factory where anthracite has not been obtainable to the necessary extent during the war period and reliance has had to be placed upon coke.By using anthracite containing not more than 4 per cent, of ash and 0&quot; 04 per cent, of phosphorus in con-junction with lime prepared from a reasonably good limestone of not less than 97 per cent, purity (con-taining, say, not more than 1 per cent, of silica, 015 per cent, of magnesia, and 0-01 per cent, of phos-phorus), it is stated that excellent results can be secured in modern carbide furnaces. (Bingham, pp. 80 and 81.)The figures in respect of anthracite, derived from the same sources as those given above indicate that 016 to 0- 63 metric ton is required per metric ton of carbide produced, and a figure of 0&apos;62 metric ton has been adopted.The cost of the anthracite will be governed by the conditions previously mentioned in connection with lime. Having regard to the fact that suitable anthracite-cite was being obtained from S. Wales by Scandinavian-scandinavian factories prior to the war for something like  0-95 to  1&apos;2 per ton, including freight, the cost de-livered at a favourably situated factory in this country should not exceed  0&apos;8 per metric ton, and this figure has been adopted.Electrodes for Clarbide Furnaces.Electrodes of good quality carbon or of artificial graphite are used in the manufacture of carbide. The consumption of graphite electrodes per metric ton of carbide produced is stated to be appreciably lower than that of ordinary carbon electrodes (Bingham, p. 178), but the cost of the former amounts to several times that of the latter. The consumption of carbon electrodes when a high quality coke is used for the carbide melt, is approximately one-third lower than that when anthracite is employed. In the latter case, the consumption amounts to from 0&quot; 02 to 0- 03 metric ton of electrodes per metric ton of carbide produced, and the mean figure of 0*025 metric ton has been adopted.The cost of the carbon electrodes amounts to about  14 to  15 per metric ton, and the latter figure has been adopted, representing a charge of  0*375 for electrodes per metric ton of carbide produced,Power requirements.&apos;According to information received from a number of reliable sources the consumption of energy per metric ton of carbide produced amounts from 0-45 to 0-5 k.w.-year for a large-scale plant. These figures appear to relate to a normal working year of about 8,400 to 8,500 hours.U  (J61tIt has been stated, however, on good authority that about 5 per cent, less energy is required in the manu-facture of a carbide for subsequent conversion into cyanamide than in the manufacture of a carbide of the quality suitable for lighting purposes.In the case of a modern Continental factory pro-ducing both carbide and cyanamide, it is stated that, when raw materials of good quality are employed the output of carbide of a quality yielding 30U litres of acetylene per kilogramme amounts to from 713 to 7&apos; 5 kg. per k.w,-day of 24 hours. Allowing for electrical losses of 5 per cent, in the transformers and leads, the power requirements per metric ton of carbide thus amount to from 0-4 to 0-41 k.w.-year of 8,400 hours at the switchboard.The figure of 0&apos;5 k.w.-year of 8,400 to 8,500 hours per metric ton of carbide has been adopted by the Sub-Committee.The influence of the cost of energy upon the cost of production of calcium carbide is dealt with on the next page.THE ECONOMICS OF CARBIDE MANUFACTURE.The figures given below are based upon the working of modern factories of fairly large capacity, or are taken from estimates for installations having outputs varying from 12,000 to 40,000 tons of carbide per annum.Capital Cost of Carbide Factory.The figures obtained for the capital cost of different carbide factories show some variation, but not more than might have been expected when regard is had to the different local conditions prevailing in each case. Information, from several sources indicates a capital cost varying from  2*2 to  3-1 per metric ton of carbide per annum, while other figures place the cost at  4- 5 and  5&apos; 2 respectively per metric ton per annum. The cost of the buildings in some of the above figures ranges from 35 to 50 per cent, of the total cost.In the light of other evidence dealing with the relative order of costs in this country and abroad, a capital cost of  3 per metric ton of carbide per annum would appear to be&apos; adequate for a large-scale well-arranged factory in this country on the basis of pre-war conditions. This figure has been adopted by the Sub-Committee.Assuming that the factory were installed in con-nection with a large steam power station of 100,000 k.w. maximum demand, as in the case of the arc process (Section III.), the proportionate capital cost of the carbide power section would amount to 0 - 5 x  10126 -  5-13 per metric ton of carbide per annum, making a total capital cost of  8113 per metric ton per annum for the complete power and chemical installation. The capital cost of the power section would be somewhat greater, say about 10 per cent., if the carbide factory were installed at an ad hoc power steam-power station of, say, S0.OOO k,w. capacity.Production Costs, exclusive of Power.  (Evidence.)The figures for the cost of production show more variation than those for capital cost. Upon analysis, however, it has been found that the variations are mainly due to differences in the cost of electrical energy, and this factor has been excluded from the figures given below.Several estimates comprising itemised production costs based upon foreign conditions of manufacture haye been under review, and the following examples indicate the order of the production costs under pre-war conditions, exclusive of power, packing and interest on capital.According to an estimate based upon the working of a large-scale plant abroad, the following production costs are specified per metric ton of carbide1 k

It will be noted that the factory is favourably situated in respect of supplies of limestone, but the other materials have to be imported. The costs do not appear to include allowances for general expenses and amortization.According to the statement of another authority, the production cost of carbide with hydro-electric energy at  2 - 64 (35 kroner) per k.w.-year amounts to  4 per metric ton unpacked at the factory. Taking the power requirements at 0-5 k.w.-year per metric ton of carbide, the production costs, exclusive of power, would thus amount to  2 - 68 per metric ton.Raw materials and electrodes Labour     -     -     - -General expenses .....

The electrodes are charged at  15 per metric ton.Probable Production Costs, excluding Power.In considering the above figures in the light of the conditions obtaining in this counti-y, it is probable that a site could be found where the conditions were favourable from the point of view of supplies both of lime and of anthracite or coke. The figures previously adopted for the cost of the raw materials must be taken as applying to such a site. With regard to the cost of labour, the evidence collected by the Sub-Committee tends to show that the rates of wages in Scandinavia prior to the war were of approximately the same order as the rates in Great Britain for similar classes of work.After careful consideration of the figures under review, the Sub-Committee is of the opinion that in the case of a large-scale well-arranged carbide factory with modern labour-saving appliances, the production costs on a pre-war basis, exclusive of power, packing, and interest on capital, would probably be approxi-mately as follows :   .Carbide per metric ton. Lime : 950 kg. at  0-75 per metric ton     - 0 - 712..

The figures of  1 - 2 and  2 per k.w.-year respectively represent the price of energy from &quot;cheap&quot; and &quot;average&quot; Norwegian water-power installations, inclusive of capital charges.The Power Sub-Oommittee&apos;s estimated figure of  3-75 per k.w.-year of 8,540 hours, mentioned in con-nection with the arc process (Section III.), has been taken in order to indicate the possible cost of mahu-facturing carbide in this country at a factory havingESTIMATED COST OP CALCIUM CARBIDE.V Production Costs.	  per metric ton of Carbide.

the advantage of operating in connection with a steam-power station of large size, namely, 1.00,000 lew. maximum demand,The production costs with energy at higher figures can be readily determined from the above table since each additional  1 per lew.-year increases the manu-facturing costs by  0- 5 per metric ton of carbide.There are reasons for believing that the power requirements according to the best modern practice in carbide making are somewhat less than 0*5 k.w.-yearper metric ton of carbide, and the figures given above are therefore probably on the safe side.The packing of the carbide for the market repre-sents a substantial addition to the manufacturing charges, and under pre-war conditions the cost&apos; of packing the carbide in iron and wood drums, including labour, would amount to a further  115 per metric ton. This charge, however, would not be incurred in the case of the utilisation of the carbide on the spot for the manufacture of cyanamide.CONVERSION OE CARBIDE INTO CYANAMIDE.The conversion of carbide into cyanamide is effected by passing nitrogen gas under a slight pressure into a furnace in which the finely ground carbide is subjected to a preliminary heating in order to start the reaction. The preliminary heating may be effected externally, or, as is more usual, by means of internal electrical heating elements, the latter method being better adapted for controlling an exothermic reaction in which an excessive&apos; rise of temperature must be avoided. It may be noted that the addition of certain reagents, such as fluorspar, facilitates the absorption of the nitrogen at a reduced temperature, and use is made of such reagents in the manufacture of cyanamide.&quot;Various forms of furnaces have been employed for the conversion process, and two principal types involving different methods of working are in successful com-mercial operation.The first or discontinuous method of working is carried out by the employment of batches of com-paratively small furnaces, each having a capacity of 0-5 to 2 tons. When the reaction is complete the furnaces, after being allowed to cool for some hours, are emptied and recharged with fresh carbide).The second or continuous method of winking is carried out by the employment of larger furnaces, each having a capacity of from 15 to 18 tons a day, the carbide being introduced and the cyanamide removed in a continuous manner, the cooling of the cyanamide being effected after its removal from the furnace.For a plant of given capacity, the continuous method of working involves a much smaller number of furnaces than the discontinuous method, and the labour requirements are also reduced. It is also claimed that the consumption of carbide and of energy per metric ton of cyanamide produced are sensibly lower than in the case of the discontinuous process. The economics of the two processes are therefore dealt with separately below;The chief raw material required for the conversion process is nitrogen gas. This was formerly separated from the atmosphere by passing air over heated copper-in order to fix the oxygen, the copper being regene-rated by means of a reducing agent such as water-gas. The modern practice, however, is to employ one or other of the well-known air liquefaction processes, and the costs of producing nitrogen in this way are set out below.COST OF NITROGEN AND QUANTITY REQUIRED.It is found necessary in practice to separate a sub-stantially larger amount of nitrogen than is ultimately fixed in the form of cyanamide, and it appears to be usual to allow for the absorption of about 70 to 75 per cent, of the output of the nitrogen plant.The costs involved in separating nitrogen from the atmosphere by means of modern liquefaction plants are well established on account of the extensive scale upon which such plants have been employed. The following figures, which were quoted in a previous section (Sec-tion I v&quot;.), are given as an example, and are based upon the working of a fairly large liquid air-plant of the Claude type used in connection with a cyanamide factory abroad.Capital Cost of Nitrogen Section.The pre-war capital cost of a plant comprising three units each having a capacity of 800 cu. m. of nitrogen per hour, one unit being in reserve, with compressors and motors, is quoted at about  38,000, the necessary buildings costing an additional  5,000.The output of this plant is about 2 metric tons of nitrogen per hour, or 16,800 metric tons per year of 50 weeks, corresponding to a capital cost of about  2-56 per metric ton of nitrogen produced per annum.Production Costs.The working costs of the above-mentioned plant, based upon pre-war j prices, are given as follows :Per Per1,000 cu. m.  1.000 cu   it..   &apos; ,*. dLabour -     -                  - 1-538 0-523Materials (caustic soda, &amp;c.) - 1-029 0-350Upkeep of buildings and plant 0-903 0-30C Amortization of plant at 10per cent.   -     -     -     - 5-534 1-881Total, exclusive of power  9-004        3-060The power requirements amount to 437 e.h.p.-hours, or 326 k.w.-hours per 1,000 cu. m. of nitrogen. If the cost of energy is taken at, say, 0 - 25c?. per k.w.-hour. the cost of production, exclusive of interest on capital, would amount to, say, 15-8s. per 1,000 cu. m. (5-37d. per 1,000 cu, ft.) or  0 - 632 per metric ton of nitrogen gas.On the basis of a loss of 30 per cent, of the nitrogen during the conversion stage, every metric ton of nitrogen fixed in the form of cyanamide would necessitate the production of 1 - 43 metric tons of nitro-gen gas, costing about  0-9. For a cyanamide con-taining 20 per cent, of nitrogen, the working costs of the nitrogen plant alone, with energy at the price assumed, would only amount to  0 -18 per metric ton of cyanamide obtained. It will be seen, therefore, that the cost of the nitrogen is not a very important item in the production costs of cyanamide.No allowance has been made for the large quan-tities of by-product oxygen obtained from the liquid air plant, amounting to some 200 cu. m. or 7,000 cu. ft. per metric ton of nitrogen produced. If a market could be secured for the by-product even at a low selling price, the credit obtained would have a sensible influence upon the production costs of cyanamide.THE DISCONTINUOUS CYANAMIDE PROCESS.The figures under review for this process are based, upon the production of different grades of cyanamide containing from 15 to 20 per cent, of combined nitrogen. In order to render them strictly comparable, they have been reduced to the basis of a metric ton of com--bined nitrogen in the form of cyanamide, or of a* standard composition of cyanamide containing 20 per cent, of nitrogen.
Quantity of Carbide required.Figures derived from several sources indicate that the quantity of carbide required per metric ton of nitrogen fixed amounts to about 4 metric tons. In the case of cyanamide containing 20 per cent, of eom-bined nitrogen, this is equivalent to 018 metric ton of carbide per ton of cyauamide, and this figure has been adopted.Power requirements.The power requirements for the conversion stage in respect of the nitrogen plant, the crushing and the preliminary heating of the carbide, and the crushing of the cyanamide, are not large.Most of the figures under review give the overall consumption of energy in the carbide and conversion stages, and according to several independent autho-rities this amounts to 3 e.h.p.-years (2- 238 k,w.-years) per metric ton of nitrogen fixed as cyanamide. (See also Lunge, Coal Tar and Ammonia, 1916, Part 3, p. 1130.) This figure appears to relate to a normal working year of 8,400 to 8,500 hours.Am overall figure of 2 - 3 k.w.-years of 8,400 to 8,500 hours per metric ton of nitrogen fixed, equivalent to 0*46 k.w.-year per metric ton of cyanamide (20 per cent. N), has been adopted by the Sub-Committee.The consumption of energy per metric ton of carbide produced has been taken as 0&apos;5 k.w.-year, and as 4 metric tons are required for the manufacture of cyanamide equivalent to a metric ton of combined nitrogen, the power requirements for the conversion stage alone as indicated by the above figures amount to 0-3 k.w.-year per metric ton of nitrogen fixed. This value is confirmed by detailed figures from other sources which place the power requirements for the conversion stage at 0*3 to 0-4 k.w.-year.Capital Cost of Cyanamide Section.A few detailed figures have been obtained con-cerning the cost of the cyanamide section of a complete carbide - cyanamide factory, but in the majority of cases the figures from the most reliable sources have been in the form of an overall capital cost for a complete factory. The figures quoted below relate, in all cases, to plants having outputs of 20,000 metric tons of cyanamido or more per annum, and are based upon pre-war prices.According to one statement before the Sub-Com -mittee the overall cost, inclusive of packing plant for the cyanamide, amounts to  34-8 per metric ton of nitro-gen fixed per annum. Taking the figure previously adopted for the cost of the carbide section, namely,  3 per metric ton per annum, on the basis of 4 metric tons of carbide per ton of nitrogen fixed the cost of the cyanamide section inclusive of packing plant works out at  22 - 8 per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum in the form of cyanamide. This is equivalent to  4-56 per metric ton of cyanamide (20 per cent. N) per annum.Another witness- referred to a cyanamide factory the overall cost of which amounted to 1  34 -1 per metric ton of nitrogen fixed per annum, and stated that the carbide section accounted for 30 to 35 per cent, of the total cost. On this basis, the cost of the cyanamide section would amount from  23 - 9 to  22 - 2 per metric ton of nitrogen fixed per ammin. and the equivalent capital cost per metric ton of cyanamide (20 per cent. N) per annum would be  4-78 to  4-44. The corresponding figures for the carbide section are  2 - 5 to  2 - 9 per metric ton of carbide per annum.The same witness also quoted another overall capital cost of  36&apos; 5 per metric ton of nitrogen fixed per annum, the proportion between the costs of the carbide and the cyanamide sections being as before. In this case the capital cost of the cyanamide section works out at  25 - 6 to  23 - 7 per metric ton of nitrogen fixed per annum, or  5 -12 to  4 - 74 per metric ton of cyanamide (20 per cent. N) per annum. The corre-sponding figures for the carbide section are  2 - 7 to  3&quot; 2 per metric ton of carbide per annum.A statement giving the costs of the carbide and cyanamide sections separately quoted a cost of  135,000 for a plant capable of converting 400 tons ofcarbide per week into cyanamide (20 to 22 per cent. N) inclusive of  22,000 for nitrogen plant, On the basis of four tons of carbide per ton of nitrogen fixed and a year of 50 weeks, the cost is equivalent to  27 per ton of nitrogen fixed per annum, or  5 - 4 per ton of cyanamide (20 per cent. N) per annum. It is not clear from the statement in question whether the quantities referred to are expressed in terms of metric tons or long tons.All of tho above figures are based upon Continental practice, and the costly nature of the buildings characterising some of the plants in Scandinavia has been taken into consideration in applying the figures to British conditions. The Sub-Committee has reasons for believing that some of the figures given above would be on the high side for the cyanamide section of a large factory erected in this country on the basis of pre-war prices, and considers that the capital cost under such conditions should not amount to more than  4-5 per metric ton of cyanamide (20 per cent. N) per annum, or  22-5 per metric ton of nitrogen fixed per annum. This figure includes the cost of nitrogen and packing plants and has been adopted as the capital cost of the cyanamide section of a factory involving the discontinuous method of working.Probable Overall Cost of complete Factory.Prom the figures previously adopted, it will be seen that the Sub-Committee&apos;s estimate of the pre-war capital cost of a large-scale carbide-cyanamide factory is as follows :Cyanamide (20 per cent, N). per metric ton per annuin. Carbide section, 0-8 at  3  -     -     -   2-4 Cyanamide section, including nitrogen and packing plants -     -     -     -   4-5Total   -     -     -  6-9equivalent to  34 - 5 per metric ton of nitrogen fixed per annum.Assuming tnat the factory were installed in con-nectionwith a large steam power station of 100,000 k.w. maximum demand, as in the case of the arc process (Section III.), the Power Sub-Committee&apos;s estimate when taken in conjunction with the power require-ments previously specified, namely, 0 - 40 k.w.-year per metric ton of cyanamide (20 per cent. N), indicate a capital cost of 0-46 x  10-26 ^  4-72 per metric ton of cyanamide per annum for the necessary power section of a complete carbide-cyanamide factory. The total capital cost of the power and chemical sections would thus amount to  11 - 62 per metric ton of cyanamide-mide (20 per cent. N) per annum, or  58 -1 per metric ton of nitrogen fixed per annum.In the event of an ad hoc power station of smaller size being used, the capital cost would be increased somewhat, and in this connection it may be noted that the Power Sub-committee&apos;s estimate for a 30,000 k.w.-power station of a special character (without spare generators) places the pre-war capital cost at just over  11 per k.w, demanded.Conversion Costs, exclusive of Power.  (Evidence.)As in the case of capital cost, figures have been obtained dealing with the cost of conversion from carbide to cyanamide, but those upon which most reliance can be placed deal with the overall production costs involved in the carbide and cyanainide stages.Information obtained from one source indicates an overall cost of  21-75 per metric ton of nitrogen fixed, exclusive of power. If the cost of the neces-sary raw carbide is allowed for on the basis previously adopted, namely, four metric tons at  3-136 per ton exclusive of power, the above figure indicates a con-version cost amounting to  9&apos;21 per metric ton of nitrogen fixed, or  1 - 84 per metric ton of cyanamide (20 per cent. N).According to another statement the overall pro-duction cost, including packing but exclusive of power, amounts to  23-5 per metric ton of nitrogen fixed.
Making allowance for the cost of the raw carbide as before, the cost of conversion and packing would amount to  10&apos;96 per metric ton of nitrogen fixed, or  2 &quot;19 per metric ton of cyanamide (20 per cent. N). The cost of packing will probably amount to about  0*5 per metric ton of cyanamide, thus indicating a conversion cost of  1*69 per metric ton of cyanamide (20 per cent. N).Another authoritative witness stated that with hydro-electric energy at  2-64 (35 kroner) per k.w.-year, raw lump carbide would cost about  4 per metric ton, and cyanamide (20 per cent. N) about  5 per metric ton, exclusive of packing. According to these figures the cost of the carbide, exclusive of power would be  2&apos;68 per metric ton, and on the basis of, 0&quot;8-metric ton of carbide and 0-46 lew.-year per metric ton of cyanamide (20 per cent. N), the cost of converting the carbide into cyanamide, exclusive of power, would be  1*64 per metric ton of cyanamide (20 per cent. N).These figures show a close agreement, and in view of their origin, greater reliance has been placed upon them than upon other figures that have been under review.Probable Conversion Costs.Taking into account the foreign basis of the above figures, the Sub-Committee has come to the conclusion that the pre-war cost of converting carbide into cyanamide by the discontinuous process, exclusive of power, packing, and of interest on capital, would be approximately as follows for a large-scale factory.C3ranamide (20 per cent. N) per metric ton. Nitrogen, electrodes, labour, repairs, and expenses -     -   &apos; -     - - 1- 40Depreciation at 8 per cent, on  4- 5   - 0 - 30Totalequivalent to  8 - 8 per metric ton of nitrogen fixed.Overall Production Costs, excluding Power.From the figures previously adopted for the cost of carbide and for its conversion into cyanamide by the discontinuous process, it will be seen that the approxi-mate pre-war cost of manufacturing cyanamide in thiscountry by means of a large-scale factory of 20,000 tons or greater annual capacity, favourably situated in respect of supplies of raw materials, would be :Cyanamide (20 per cent. N) per metric tonRaw carbide : 0-8 metric ton at  3-136 per ton, ex. power -     -     -     -     -     -  2-51Cost of conversion to cyanamide, ex. power -  1 - 7(5Total4-27This is equivalent to  21-35 per metric ton of nitrogen fixed as cyanamide and represents the cost at the factory of the unpacked product, exclusive of power and of interest on capital.If an allowance of 5 per cent, is made for the latter item, i.e., 5 percent, on  6-9, the cost, exclusive of power and of packing, would amount to  4*615 per metric ton of cyanamide (20 per cent. N) or  23 - 07 per metric ton of nitrogen fixed as cyanamide.Influence or Cost of Energy on Production Costs.The following table indicates in a comparative manner the influence of the cost of energy upon the production costs of carbide-cyanamide.The figures of  1-2 and  2 per k.w.-year repre-sent the price of energy from &quot; cheap &quot; and &quot; average &quot; Norwegian water-power installations inclusive of capital charges,The Power Sub-Committee&apos;s estimated figure of  3* 75 per k.w.-year of 8,540 hours, mentioned in con-nection with the arc process (Section III.), has been taken in order to indicate the possible cost of manu-facturing cyanamide in this country at a factory having the advantage of operating in connection with a steam-power station of large size, namely, 100,000 k.w. maximum demand.The cost of production with energy at higher figures can be readily determined from the table given below when it is remembered that for each additional  1 per k.w.-year the manufacturing costs are increased by  0 * 46 per metric ton of cyanamide (20 per cent. N) or  2 * 3 per metric ton of combined nitrogen in the form of cyanamide.ESTIMATED COST OF CYANAMIDE BY THE DISCONTINUOUS PROCESS.Pjjodtjction Costs.	  per metric ton of Cyanamide (20 per cent.

U  6619    &apos;Observations.In considering the above table from the point of view of British and Norwegian conditions, it may be noted ^ that the prices taken for lime and anthracite apply to a factory erected at a favourable site in this &apos; country. As every metric ton of cyanamide requires about 0 * 75 metric ton of lime and about 0 * 5 metric ton of anthracite or coke, the freight on one or both of these materials will probably, at a moderate estimate, place a Scandinavian factory at a dis-advantage of from  0 * 3 to  0*5 per ton of cyanamide as compared with a favourably situated factory in this
country. When the cost of freight for placing the foreign product on the British market is also taken into account, the cost of production in this country at a large factory utilising a steam turbo-electric power plant would probably be about on a parity with the price at which cyanamide made at a hy dro-electric installation in Scandinavia could be marketed in Great Britain,The pre-war market price of cyanamide (18 per cent. N) in this country amounted to  10&apos;62 per long ton or  10:45 per metric ton, equivalent to,  58&apos; 08 per metric ton of combined nitrogen.THE CONTINUOUS CYANAMIDE PROCESS.The continuous cyanamide process, to which reference has already been made, has been in operation abroad for some time past on a fairly large scale, and detailed estimates based upon the actual working of the factory have been supplied to he Sub-Committee.The advantages claimed for the continuous process e o.s follows:a) A lower capital cost for the chemical plant.(6) A lower consumption of carbide per ton of cyanamide produced.(c) A lower consumption of  energy per toncyanamide produced.(d) A reduction in the charges for labour and repairs.The effect of these advantages is seen in the . figures given below which have been put forward in respect of a large factory having an output of over 50,000 tons of cyanamide per annum. Estimates for factories of smaller size show an increase in most of the items, as would be expected. It may be noted that, according to the information available, the normal working of the process results in the pro-duction of a raw cyanamide containing 19 to 19&apos;5 per cent, of nitrogen, and the figures given below are based upon a nitrogen content of 19&apos; 5 per cent. In. order, however, to render them comparable with the figures previously given, the &quot;equivalent values on the basis of a nitrogen content of 20 per cent, and of a metric ton of combined nitrogen are also set out.Quantity of Carbide required.The figures under review indicate that the quantity of carbide required per metric ton of nitrogen fixed amounts to about 3&apos; 625 metric tons, as against 4 metric tons for the discontinuous process. A metric ton of cyanamide (19-5 per cent. N) thus requires 0&apos; 707 metric ton of carbide, the equivalent figure for a nitrogen content of 20 per cent, being 0-725 ton,Power requirements.The total power requirements for the carbide, nitrogen, and cyanamide stages of the process are specified as 1 - 97 k.w.-years of 8,400 hours per metric ton of nitrogen fixed, the corresponding figure for the discontinuous process being 2&apos;3 k.w.-years. The production of a metric ton of cyanamide (19* 5 per cent. N) thus involves a consumption of energy amounting to 0-384 k.w.-year, the equivalent figure for a nitrogen content of 20 per cent, being 0-394 k.w.-vear.Capital Cost of Carbide-Cyanamide Factory.The capital cost of the nitrogen and cyanamide sections, exclusive of packing plant, is given as  17 - 58 -per metric ton of nitrogen fixed per annum and the overall cost of the complete chemical factory as about  25125, corresponding to  4 - 92 per metric ton of cyanamide (19-5 per cent. N) per annum. The equivalent figure for a nitrogen content of 20 percent, would be  5&apos;05, and may be compared with tho figure of  6 - 9 adopted for the discontinuous process, although it should be noted that the latter figure is inclusive of packing plant.The capital cost of the necessary steam turbo-electric power section on the basis previously indicated would amount to 0-384 x  10-26 or&apos; 3* 94 per metric ton of cyanamide (19&apos; 5 per cent, N) per annum.The total capital cost of the power and chemical sections, exclusive of packing plant, would thus amount to  8&apos;86 per metric ton of cyanamide (19* 5 per cent. N), or  45&apos;45 per metric ton of nitrogen fixed per annum. The corresponding figures in the case of the discontinuous process were  11&apos; 62 (for a cyanamide containing 20 per cent, of nitrogen), and  58 &apos;1 respec-tively, inclusive of packing plant.Reference was made early in this section (page 252) to the after-treatment of the raw cyanamide for the purpose of rendering it suitable for the fertiliser market. The plant required for this purpose is not of a costly... character, and according to the estimates under review the capital expenditure amounts to about  0&apos; 9 per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum in the form of cyanamide.Production Costs, exclusive of Power.The production costs include a figure previously given for the production cost of carbide, viz.,  2-955 per metric ton, exclusive of power, with limestone at  0 - 28 and coal and anthracite at  1 -12 per metric ton, and with labour at  0-28 per shift. The overall costs may be summarised as follows, and are exclusive of power, packing, and of interest on capital. The items for carbide and nitrogen are inclusive in each case of materials, labour, and general charges, and also of amortization of the corresponding sections of the plant:Cyanamide (19-5 per cent.

The equivalent cost per metric ton of cyanamide having a nitrogen content of 20 per cent, would be  3 - 33, the corresponding figure adopted in the case of the! discontinuous process being  4 - 27.If an allowance is made for interest on the capital cost of the chemical sections at the rate of 5 per cent., the production cost for the continuous process would amount to  3 - 49 per metric ton of cyanamide (19 * 5 per cent. N).The after-treatment of the raw cyanamide with, water and oil to render it suitable for manurial purposes results in an increase in weight as previously stated, and the raw cyanamide containing about 19 * 5 per cent, of combined nitrogen yields a fertiliser containing about 17*5 per cent.According to the estimate, the cost of the after-treatment amounts to about  1 * 13 per metric ton of combined nitrogen in the foi-m of cyariamide, or approximately  0 * 2 per metric ton of the final product containing 17*5 per cent, of nitrogen.Influence of Cost Of Energy on Production Costs.The following comparative table, on the lines of that already given in connection with the discontinuous process, indicates the influence of the cost of energy upon the cost of manufacturing cyanamide (19*5 per cent. N) by the continuous process :

N) suitable for the fertiliser market.The cost of energy in all the above cases is inclusive of capital charges on the power plant. If interest at the rate of 5 per cent, is allowed for on the capital cost of the chemical sections, the production costs of raw cyanamide by the continuous process, exclusive of packing and of after-treatment, are as follows per metric ton of cyanamide (19 - 5 per cent. N): 3-95       4-26       4-64      4-93 equivalent to  20-28      21-85      23-82    25-30per metric ton of nitrogen fixed as cyanamide.Observations,If the estimated production costs of cyanamide by the continuous process are compared with the figures adopted in the case of the discontinuous process, they indicate in a striking manner the advantages claimed for the former process. In the first place, it will be noted that the f satisfactory cost of a metric ton of combined nitrogen in the form of raw cyanamide by the continuous process with energy at the highest figure taken, namely,  3 &quot;75 per k.w.-year, is approximately the same as the cost by the discontinuous process with energy at the lowest figure given, namely,  1 - 2 per k.w.-year.In the second place, attention may be drawn to the lower capital cost and the consequent lower capital charges in the case of the continuous process.The estimates under consideration by the Sub-Committee were carefully prepared by the firm operating the continuous process and deal in a very detailed manner with tire costs involved. The factory itself has been officially inspected on behalf of the Department,  and the technical evidence obtainedduring the course of the inspection affords a general confirmation of the claims made for the process.With regard, however, to the operating costs, the evidence is not complete and appears to indicate that some of the items put forward in the estimate are on the low side. Having regard to this fact and to the production figures that the firm is prepared to guarantee, the Sub-Committee is of the opinion that the figures for the estimated manufacturing costs and for the power requirements should be increased by a margin of 5 per cent, to allow for contingencies. The modified figures would then probably approximate to the costs likely to be incurred at a large-scale factory in this country on the basis of pre-war conditions. It should be noted, however, that the cost of raw materials at a favourably situated site in this country would show an advantage over the figm-es given in the estimate^ as indicated previously in connection with the dis-continuous process, and it is possible that this advantage would compensate for the mar-gin suggested above. In consequence, the figures in the tables at the end of this Appendix (Tables 1 and 2) are based upon the costs given in the estimate and do not include the above allowance.The cost of energy has a much smaller influence upon the manufacturing costs in the case of the cyanamide-mide process than in the case of the arc process, as will be seen by a comparison of Charts A and B at the end of the Appendix. Upon the basis of the above figures, every additional  1 per k.w.-year affects the production costs by the continuous process to the extent of  0-384 per me trio ton of cyanamide (19 - 5 per cent. N) or  1-97 per metric ton of combined nitrogen in the form of cyanamide.The Power Sub-Committee&apos;s estimate of the pre-war running cost of a special steam turbo-electric power station of 30,000 k.w.-capacity (without spare generators) amounts to  4-08 per k.w.-year of 8,540 hours with coal at 7s. Qd. per ton, inclusive of capital charges. At this figure the production cost of cyanamide-mide (19-5 per cent. N) by the continuous process would amount to  4*81 per metric ton, equivalent to about  24*7 per metric ton of combined nitrogen. The influence of the cost of energy up to  6 per k.w.-year upon the production cost is shown on Chart B already referred to.
SECTION VI.AMMONIA AND AMMONIUM SULPHATE FROMCYANAMIDE.iThe manufacture of ammonia from cyanamide is a comparatively simple process involving the treatment of the finely ground material, with steam under pres-sure in an autoclave.A description of the commercial operation of the process has been published (Landis, Journal of Indus-trial and Engineering Chemistry, Feb. 1916, Vol. 8, No. 2, page 156), and a brief account will therefore suffice for present purposes.The cyanamide is fed with constant stirring into an autoclave charged wifli water or with mother liquor from a previous operation. Impurities in the cyanamide-mide, such as free calcium carbide and calcium phos-phide, are decomposed and the gases evolved at this stage of the process are allowed to escape. Small quantities of caustic lime and soda ash, about 2 per cent, and 3- 5 per cent, respectively of the amount of cyanamide under treatment, are then added in order to facilitate the evolution of ammonia and to prevent the formation of complex nitrogen derivatives. The autoclave is closed and steam admitted for a short time until the pressure rises to about three or four atmospheres, the heat evolved during the decompo-sition of the cyanamide sufficing to maintain and complete the reaction. When the evolution of gas is complete, the liquor in the autoclave is treated with steam until the ammonia dissolved in the liquor has been expelled.The ammonia can be condensed to a strong pure liquor of 20 per cent, strength, or fixed directly as ammonium sulphate. If desired, it may be converted into anhydrous liquid ammonia, or utilised in the gaseous form for other purposes.According to Landis a large number of installa-tions have been operating with success in various parts of the world for a number of years, but little information appears to be available concerning such plants. It is known, however, that considerable deve-lopments have taken place in this industry during the war, particularly in Germany, and it may be mentioned that two conversion plants of moderate capacity have also been installed in the United Kingdom since the outbreak of war.Efficiency of Conversion.The efficiency of the conversion of the nitrogen content of cyanamide into ammonia is stated by Landis to be 99 per cent. Other figures under review indicate efficiencies of 94 per cent, and 95 per cent.Having regard to the fact that the expulsion of the last traces of ammonia from the mother liquor neces-sitates continued steaming for some time, a conversion efficiency of 95 per cent, would appear to be a reason-able figure for average conditions of working and has been adopted by the Sub-Committee.Residue or Sludge.The residue in the autoclave consists of a mixture of calcium carbonate, hydrated lime and carbon. The material when dried contains about 65 per cent, of lime in the form of carbonate and hydrate and finds application as an agricultural lime. (Landis, previously quoted.)It has been stated that when steam is employed for the conversion, the whole of the lime and one-third of the carbon used for the carbide melt are recovered in a form in which they can be used again for the manufacture of calcium carbide. If water is employed, in which case hydrated lime is formed, the expense of the conversion into ammonia is partly covered by the sraphite recovered from the residue (Lunge, Coal Tar and Ammonia, 1916, Part 3, page 1138).With a conversion efficiency of 95 per cent., 4- 33 metric tons of cyanamide containing 20 per cent, of nitrogen are required for producing a metric ton of ammonia, and yield a residue amounting to over 5 tons reckoned in the dry condition. As the weight of the sludge itself would probably be about 40 per cent, in excess of that of the dry residue, it will be seen that the problem of drying and disposing of the sludge is one of considerable magnitude in the case of a large-scale conversion plant.THE ECONOMICS OF CONVERSION.The statement published by Landis sets out in considerable detail the capital and operating costs of a conversion plant. The Sub-Committee has also obtained other figures based upon the working of large-scale foreign plants and of one of the plants established in this countryCapital Cost of Conversion Plant.The various figures for capital cost that have been under review are dealt with briefly below.An early pre-war figure for a large-scale conversion plant indicates a capital cost of  ll-45 per metric ton of ammonia produced per annum, or  13*9 per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum in the form of ammonia. The informant admitted that the figure was on the high side, and this is confirmed by the more recent figures quoted below.Another figure, based upon pre-war prices, for a conversion plant capable of producing over 5,000 tons of ammonia per annum places the capital cost at  5&apos; 20 per metric ton of ammonia per annum, or  6-31 per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum in the form of ammonia.According to Landis (previously quoted) a con-version plant having a capacity of 30,000 lb. of ammonia per day, or, say, 4,760 metric tons per annum of 50 weeks, would cost about 120,000 dollars ( 24,000) under American conditions, exclusive of land, foun-dations, power and pumping plant, and sludge disposal. This is equivalent to  5 - 04 per metric ton of ammonia per annum, or  6&apos; 12 per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum in the form of ammonia.Information supplied to the Sub-Committee oon-cerning a plant of moderate capacity erected in this country during the war period indicates that the capital cost, inclusive of arrangements for disposing of the sludge and calculated for pre-war conditions, would amount to  5-43 per metric ton of ammonia per annum, or  6- 59 per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum in the form of ammonia.A recent estimate based upon the working of a foreign plant and upon pre-war prices indicates the following capital cost for a plant having an output of over 10,000 tons of ammonia per annum:Ammonia per metric ton per annum.Plant		-     -4	  113 027	Total   -	-  6	140equivalent to  6124 per metric ton of combined nitro-gen per annum in the form of ammonia.The figures given above are, with the exception of the first, in reasonably close agreement, and having regard to the developments that have occurred during the war period, the capital cost quoted by Landis,
9 r rJej cj ijnamely,  6 -12 per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum in the form of ammonia, appears to be adequate for a large-scale conversion plant on the basis of pre-war conditions in this country. This figure has been adopted by the Sub-Committee.Conversion Costs, exclusive of Power.The costs of conversion corresponding to the several capital costs are summarised in the following table. The figures are exclusive of the cost of the energy required, unless otherwise specified, and of losses of ammonia, but include an allowance for depre-ciation.COST OF CONVERSION.Actual NII3.   per metric ton.

The remaining figures show less variation than might have been expected having regard to the comparatively recent developments of the process. It is also possible that the cost of conversion may vary somewhat with the quality of cyanamide employed, and in this connection it may be noted that Landis refers to the employment of a cyanamide equivalent to 26 per cent, of ammonia, i.e., containing over 21-4 per cent, of combined nitrogen.After a careful consideration of the figures, and in view of the comparatively simple nature of the process, the Sub-Committee has come to the conclusion that the conversion costs for a large-scale plant, based upon pre-war conditions in this country, may be taken at the value given by Landis, namely,  4-05 per metric ton of combined nitrogen in the form of ammonia, and this has been adopted. It should be noted that the figure is inclusive of amortization at 8 per cant., hut does not include any allowance for losses of ammonia during conversion, for the cost of power, or for interest on capital.According to recent information it is expected, with a new design of plant now being built in America, to reduce the cost to less than one-half of the figure put forward by Landis and forming the basis of that adopted by the Sub-Committee.Power requirements.The power requirements for the conversion process are small. According to Landis the consumption of energy is equivalent to about 131 k.w.-hours per metric ton of ammonia, and an estimate based upon the working of another foreign plant indicates a figure of 128 k.w,-hours.The Sub-Committee has taken a figure of 130 k.w.-hours (0-015 k.w.-year of 8,500 hours), per metric ton of ammonia produced, equivalent to 0&apos;018 k.w&apos;.-year per metric ton of combined nitrogen in the form of ammonia.Taking the cost of energy at 0 - 25d. per k.w.-hour, the charge incurred for the power requirements would amount to 130 x 0&apos;25oL r:  0-135 per metric ton of ammonia, or  0-164 per metric ton of combined nitrogen.The cost of conversion, exclusive of losses of ammonia and of interest on capital, would thus become  3-475 per metric ton of ammonia, or  4-214 per metric ton of combined nitrogen. If an allowance is also made for interest at the rate of 5 per cent., the total conversion cost would amount to  4-52 per metric ton of combined nitrogen.THE COST OF MANUFACTURING AMMONIA VIA CYANAMIDE.Figures are given below showing the capital and production costs involved in the manufacture of ammonia on a large scale at a factory comprising carbide, cyanamide, and conversion sections.Overall Capital Cost of complete Ammonia Factory.Discontinuous Cyanamide Process,   The cost of a large-scale ammonia factory, including carbide, cyanamide, and ammonia conversion sections, is based upon the figure adopted in Section V. (p, 256) and upon the figure given above for the cost of the conversion section. Allowance is made for a margin of 5 per cent, in respect of the capacity of the carbide-cyanamide-mide section to compensate for losses of ammonia in the conversion stage:Combined Nitrogen per metric ton per annum. Carbide - cyanamide section : 1 - 05 at 34-50     ......  30-22f Conversion (ammonia) section     -     -    0-12Total      -     -  42-34equivalent to  34 - 88 per metric ton of ammonia per annum.The power requirements of the carbide-cyanamide stage,amount to 2-3 k.w.-years per metric ton of nitrogen fixed (Section V.).If the capital cost of a steam turbo-electric power plant is taken at  10 - 26 per k.w. demanded in accord-ance with the Power Sub-Committee&apos;s estimate already referred to, the capital cost of the necessary power section for the complete ammonia factory will amount to:Combined Nitrogen per metric ton per annum. Power section for carbide-cyananiide : 1-05 x 2-3 x  10-26     -     -     -  24-78Power section for conversion: 0-018 x 10-20     -     -     -     -     -     -    0-18Total      -     -  24-96The total cost of a complete power and chemical installation therefore amounts to  67&apos;3 per meti-ic ton of combined nitrogen per annum in the form of ammonia, or  55 - 44 per metric ton of actual ammonia produced per annum.Continuous Cyanamide Process. Taking the figures given in Section V. (p. 258j, for the continuous cyanamide-mide process and the figure adopted by the Sub-Oom-mittee for the cost of the conversion plant, the capital cost of the chemical sections of a complete ammonia factory would be :Combined Nitrogen per metric ton per annum. Carbide-cyanamide section: 1-05  at 25-25     ......   26-51Conversion (ammonia) section     -     -    6-12Total     -      3263equivalent to  26 - 88 per metric ton of actual ammonia jDer annum.The lower power requirements of the continuous cyanaraide process, namely, 1 - 97 k.w.-years per metric ton of combined nitrogen in the form of cyanamide, reduce the cost of the power section to  21&apos;40, bringing the total capital cost of the power and chemical sections to  54&apos;03 per metric ton of com-bined nitrogen per annum in the form of ammonia, or  44-5 per metric ton of actual ammonia per annum.
Overall Production Costs of Ammonia.The following table indicates the estimated cost of producing ammonia by means of a large-scale factory comprising carbide-cyanamide and conversion sections. It is based upon the figures previously adopted for theproduction cost of carbide-cyanamide by the discon-tinuous and continuous processes (Section V.)&apos;, and for the cost of conversion. Allowance is made for a loss of ammonia amounting to 5 per cent., during the conversion stage. Comparative columns indicate the effect-of different prices of energy. &apos;ESTIMATED PRODUCTION COSTS OP AMMONIA BY DISCONTINUOUS AND CONTINUOUS&apos; CYANAMIDE PROCESSES.  per metric ton of Combined Nitrogen in the form of Ammonia,								Production Costs.

The figure of  3 - 75 per k.w.-year of 8,540 hours represents the Power Sub-Committee^ estimate of the pre-war running costs of a large-scale steam turbo-electric power plant with coal at 7s. 6d, per ton, inclusive of all capital charges, and as in former cases has been taken as the possible cost of energy under British conditions.Discontinuous Cyanamide Process. The figures in the table represent the costs at the factory, and are exclusive of interest on the cost of the chemical plant. The corresponding costs per metric ton of actual ammonia amount respectively to : 24-20      25-81      27-81      29-34Making an allowance for interest at the rate of 5 per cent, on the capital cost of the complete chemical plant, namely,  34-88 per metric ton of ammonia per annum, the total production costs per metric ton of ammonia are as follows : 25-94      27-55      29-55      31-08It will be seen that every additional  1 per k.w.-year increases the production costs by about  2 per metric ton of ammonia.Continuous Cyanamide Process. The figures in the table are exclusive of interest on the capital cost of the chemical plant and the corresponding costs per metric ton of actual ammonia amount to : 19-79      21*18     22 89      2418If an allowance is made for interest at the rate of 5 per cent, on the cost of the chemical plant, namely,  26&apos;88 per metric ton of ammonia per annum, the total production costs per metric ton of ammonia would amount to: 21-13      22-52      24-23      25-52These figures show a marked reduction as corn-pared with the costs by the discontinuous cyanamide process, and may be contrasted with the pre-war market price of a pure form of by-product ammonia such as ammonia spirit (25 per cent. NH3) which amounted to about  50 per metric ton of actual ammonia (Section II.).It will be seen that every additional  1 perk.w.-year increases the production costs by about  1 * 7 per metric ton of ammonia. The influence of the, cost of energy up to  6 per k.w.-year upon the production costs by the continuous cyanamide process is shown on Chart B at the end of the Appendix.AMMONIUM SULPHATE VIA CYANAMIDE.The costs involved in the manufacture of ammonium sulphate by means of a large-scale factory comprising carbide, cyanamide, conversion, and sulphate sections are dealt with below.sOverall Cost of Ammonium Sulphate Factory.Discontinuous Cyanamide Process.  The capital cost of a complete ammonia factory has already been given, and that of a sulphate plant for fixing a pure strong ammonia is taken from Section II. (p. 231).1 The capital outlay for the chemical sections of a complete sulphate factory would be as follows :Combined Nitrogen per metric ton per annum.Carbide - cyanamidesections -Sulphate sectionTotaland  ammonia42-34 14-6356-97equivalent to  11-73 per metric ton of actual sulphate (25 per cent.

sections becomes  81193 per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum, equivalent to  16- 87 per metric ton of actual sulphate (25 per cent. NH3) per annum.Continuous Cyanamide Process. In the case of the continuous cyanamide process the figures indicate the following capital cost for the chemical sections of the factory:Combined Nitrogen per metric ton per annum.-  Carbide - cyanamide and  ammoniasections..... 32&apos; 63Sulphate section     -     -     -     - 14-63Total     -     -     -     -    47-26equivalent to  9 &quot;73 per metric ton of actual sulpha? &amp; (25 per cent.

NH3).It will be seen that every additional  1 per k.w.-year increases the production costs by about  0 - 5 per metric ton of sulphate.Continuous Cyanamide Process. The corresponding costs per metric ton of actual sulpliate (25 per cent. NH3) packed for the market are: 6-73      7 07      750      783Making an allowance for interest at the rate of 5 per cent, on the capital cost of the complete chemical plant, the production costs become:  7-22      7-56      7-99      8-31 per metric ton of actual sulphate (25 per cent. NH3).The above figures show a reduction as compared with the costs by the discontinuous cyanamide process, and may be contrasted with the pre-war market price of ammonium sulphate (Section II.) which amounted to  13 - 83 per long ton, equivalent to about  66 per metric ton of combined nitrogen in the form of sulphate.It will be seen that every additional  1 per k w.-year increases the production costs by about  0-43 per metric ton of sulphate. The influence of the cost of energy up to  6 per k.w.-year upon the production costs by the continuous cyanamide process is shown on Chart B at the end of the Appendix.The costs involved in converting cyajnamide ammonia into nitric acid by the ammonia oxidation process, and in manufacturing nitrates therefrom are dealt with in Sections VII. and VIII.
SECTION&quot; VII.THE AMMONIA OXIDATION PROCESS.Gaseous ammonia in the presence of air and of suitable catalysts undergoes combustion with the formation of oxides of nitrogen and water, and this reaction constitutes the basis of the ammonia oxidation process for the manufacture of nitric acid and nitrates.The technical development of the process was mainly due to the investigations carried out by Ostwald during the years 1900-1902, but many important improvements and modifications have been made since that date, both in respect of the catalysts employed and of the methods of working.Prior to the war the process had not found any extensive commercial application, though two small-scale plants for the manufacture of nitric acid and ammonium nitrate were in operation on the Continent, The system of working employed was that devised by Ostwald, platinum being used as the catalyst. A detailed estimate of the capital and production costs of a small-scale installation was published in 1913 (Iron and Coal Trades Review, May 23rd, 1913) and appears to have been based upon the working of one of these plants.War Developments.The adaptability of the ammonia oxidation process is strikingly illustrated by the remarkable develop-ments that have occurred during the war period, par-ticularly in Germany. The immense war demand for nitric acid and ammonium nitrate coupled with the stoppage of imports of Chile nitrate rendered it im-perative for Germany to utilise ammonia as a source of nitric acid, with the result that the ammonia oxidation process was soon established on a large scale. At least two standard types of converter with platinum gauze as a catalyst appear to have been devised (Metall mid Erz, Vol. 13, Jan. 22nd, 1916), and according to information obtained by the Sub-Committee over 30 installations, capable in the aggregate of converting about 12,000 tons of ammonia into over 40,000 tons of nitric acid per annum, were built in 1915 by the B.A.M.A.G. of Berlin. Other installations were under construction by the same firm during the early part of 1916 for dealing with an additional 17,000 tons of ammonia per annum. According to another statement, the process has been developed in Germany to the extent of producing nitric acid at the rate of 120,000 tons per annum. (Zeisbevg, Metallurgical and Chemical Engineering, 1916, XV., pp. 299-304)In the main, these plants appear to be used for manufacturing sodium nitrate, the reason given being that the installation of soda lye absorption apparatus can be effected much more rapidly and easily than the erection of acid absorption towers and concentrating plant for the dilute nitric acid. According to a report from a private source, the output of sodium nitrate from ammonia oxidation plants amounted to about 30,000 tons per month by the middle of 1916, representing an annual output of over 250,000 tons of nitric acid from the oxidation plants. The nitrate is said to be transported to the large explosives factories and used in lieu of Chile nitrate for the manufacture of concentrated nitric acid by the retort process.The lack of Chile nitrate for supplying the nitrous fumes required for manufacturing sulphuric acid by the leaden chamber process has also led to the exten-sive adoption of ammonia oxidation converters for this purpose.   (Metall und Erz, previously quoted.)It will be seen, therefore, that the process has attained a position of vital importance in Germany as a war emergency measure. Ammonia oxidation plants have also been erected in several of the Allied countries, but not on a scale comparable with that indicated above.A good deal of information concerning the technics of the process has been published, but considerable reticence has been observed us regards a number of the details contributing to its successful operation on a commercial scale. Moreover, the developments that have occurred during the war period are.of too recent a date to have enabled the questions as to the best type of converter and the best conditions of working to be definitely established.The research work carried out under the direction of the Experiments Sub-Committee has furnished valuable information concerning the technical aspects of the process and the capabilities of modern types of converters. This information has also afforded assisf-ance in dealing with the evidence collected by the Processes-Sub-Committee concerning the economics of ammonia oxidation.In view of the prominence attained by the process, a brief account is given below of the systems of working at present in use on a commercial scale, and of certain technical details.Commercial Processes.The regenerative method of working devised by Ostwald constitutes the basis of the process originally established on the Continent prior to the war and now in operation in some of the Allied countries. Accord-ing to this method, the mixture of ammonia and air is passed through a heat interchanger containing a catalyst consisting of platinum with a specially pre-pared surface. The reaction is exothermic, and the heat evolved during the oxidation is partly utilised for pre-heating the mixture in order to avoid an undue rise in the temperature of the catalyst and the consequent degradation of the ammonia into elementary nitrogen. The initial heating of the catalyst is effected by the combustion of a small quantity of hydrogen added to the mixture or by an auxiliary flame of hydrogen, the temperature being subsequently maintained by the heat of the reaction.The converters now being used on a large scale in Germany are of a simpler type, the heat interchanger being dispensed with, and platinum gauze being used as the catalyst. The initial heating of the gauze is usually effected electrically, although it is claimed that the use of electrical energy is unnecessary in connection with at least one of the standard forms of converter. It may be noted, however, that when the reaction has been started the evolution of heat is sufficient to maintain the temperature of the gauze, thus rendering the continued supply of electrical energy unnecessary.Various modifications have also been made in the methods of. working, such as the pre-heating of the air prior&apos; to its admixture with ammonia in the converter, the addition of secondary air to the cooled products of reaction to facilitate the conversion of the nitric oxide into nitrogen peroxide, and the employ-ment of two or more platinum gauzes in series. These modifications influence the conversion efficiency and the output of converter units, and the bearing of the latter point upon the costs involved in operating the process is dealt with later.Catalysts.As far as is known, all of the commercial plants at present in operation rely upon the use of platinum catalysts of the kinds indicated above. Many other catalysts have been proposed, however, and the advan-tages attaching to the employment of materials that are cheaper and more readily renewable than platinum have resulted in considerable attention being given to the production of equally efficient base metal catalysts. In the event of the ammonia oxidation process being
9 r r t* si appendix V. :   AMMONIA OXIDATION.265.developed on commercial lines after the war, there is a possibility that base metal catalysts will be success-fully employed.Quality of Ammonia required; Catalyst Poisons.Ammonia of a reasonably high degree of purity is stated to be required when the process is carried out with platinum catalysts, and the presence of im-purities such as conmounds of sulphur and phosphorus, which poison the catalyst, must be avoided.Although statements have been made concerning the unsuitability of by-product ammonia, it may be noted that ammonia of this origin was used at one or both of the plants established on the Continent prior to the war, and is being used in Germany at the present time. (Metall und Srz, previously quoted.) Moreover, the research work carried out under the direction of the Experiments Sub-Committee has shown that by-product ammonia of the commercial purity attained in the manufacture of pure ammonia spirit is well adapted for the process and does not give rise to any undue deterioration of the catalyst.Two points, however, must be referred to in con-nection with the utilisation of by-product ammonia. In the first place, the concentration and purification of crude ammonia liquors is rather a complex process requiring fairly elaborate plant. Any interruption in the continuous working of the plant, due, for example, to the blocking of the dephlegmators, interferes with the regular supply of a current of pure ammonia gas to the ammonia oxidation converters, and difficulties of this character appear to have been experienced in Germany. (Metall mid Erz, previously quoted.) In the second place, the cost of concentration and purifi-cation is considerable, as already indicated (Section II.), and adds materially to the cost of the nitric acid manufactured from by-product ammonia.It will be apparent from the above statements that synthetic processes capable of furnishing strong and pure or practically pure ammonia have distinct advan-tages as regards the manufacture of nitric acid and nitrates by the oxidation process. In the case, for example, of ammonia obtained by means of the Haber process, the necessity for concentration and purifica-tion is entirely avoided. A strong and practically pure ammonia can also be obtained by the decompo-sition of cyanamide, but in this case it appears that a certain amount of purification may be necessary to eliminate catalyst poisons derived from impurities in the cyanamide.Recovery Operations and Nature of Products.The degree of concentration of the oxides of nitrogen in the gases resulting from the combustion of the ammonia-air mixture depends upon the pro-portion of air used in the mixture and upon the amount of secondary air admitted to the cooled gases. Under average conditions, however, the concentration is upwards of 10 per cent, as compared with 1 to 2 per cent, in the case of the arc process. The evidence before the Sub-Committee establishes the fact that the primary product of the reaction is nitric oxide, and a large absorption space is thus necessary for efficient recovery for the reasons specified when dealing with the arc process. (Section III.) The system of absorption employed commercially is on similar lines to that adopted in connection with arc furnace plant, and the use of alkaline towers in conjunction with acid towers is necessary in order to obtain the maxi-mum recovery. The higher concentration of oxides of nitrogen, however, enables smaller towers to be em-ployed and results in the production of a dilute acid of 50 to 53 per cent, strength instead of an acid of 30 to 40 per cent, strength as in the case of the arc process. On the other hand, there is no body of waste heat avail-able for evaporating and concentrating purposes.Other systems of recovery have been proposed, and attention may be directed to the statement previously made concerning the system adopted in Germany as a war expedient, namely, absorption in alkali alone.The evidence available to the Sub-Committee also indicates that the utilisation of oxygen in connection with the ammonia oxidation process may lead to sub-stantial modifications in the present methods . of recovery.  It appears, for example, that the use ofoxygen in place of secondary air for effecting the con-version of the nitric oxide into nitrogen peroxide may permit of the employment of absorption towers of smaller capacity than at present necessary. On the other hand, proposals involving the liquefaction of the nitrogen peroxide and its subsequent conversion into nitric acid by treatment with water and oxygen in an autoclave, foreshadow the possibility of obtaining con-centrated nitric acid direct without the use of absorp-tion towers or concentrating apparatus. The successfu 1 development of such modifications must depend, among other factors, upon the availability of supplies of cheap oxygen, and in this connection it may be noted that the large quantities of by-product oxygen obtained in the manufacture of synthetic ammonia (Section IV.) would be available in the event of the oxidation process being installed at the ammonia factory.Losses of Nitrogen during Conversion and Re-covery Operations.In dealing with the cost of manufacturing nitric acid by the ammonia oxidation process, account must be taken of the losses of combined nitrogen that occur during the various stages of the process, namely, in the conversion of the ammonia into oxides of nitrogen, in the recovery of the oxides in the form of dilute acid, and in the concentration of the latter.Efficiencies of the order of 85 per cent, to 95 per cent, have been claimed in respect of the various types of converters employing platinum as a catalyst, and it is clear from the evidence available to the Sub-Committee that efficiencies of over 90 per cent, are attainable without difficulty during test runs of single converters. In large-scale commercial plants, however, the efficiency of the absorption system is also an important factor, and although it has been claimed that overall efficiencies of 85 per cent, to 92 per cent, have been attained, no reliable evidence based up an independent trials carried out under normal conditions of working has been obtained in support of these claims.It seems probable that an overall efficiency of 90 per cent, from the stage of ammonia gas to the stage of dilute acid will be attained with modern types of converters used in conjunction with a well-designed absorption system, and this figure has been adopted by the Sub-Committee in dealing with the question of costs. It corresponds to the utilisation of 0&quot; 3 metric ton of Nflj per metric ton of HN&quot;03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) obtained in the form of dilute acid.&quot;With regard to the losses that take place during the concentration stage, evidence available to the Sub-Committee indicates an allowance of 5 per cent, in converting the tower acid (53 per cent.) into a con-centrated product (93 per cent.). This allowance is higher than the authoritative figure of 3 per cent, quoted in connection with the arc process (Section III.) which yields a dilute acid of lower strength (30 to 40 per cent.) than that obtained in the ammonia oxidation process.The Sub-Committee considers that the concentra-tion losses in the latter process should not exceed 3 per cent., and this figure has been adopted.Output of Converter Units.In the commercial development of the regenerative system of working it seems to have been found expedient to employ comparatively small units in preference to units having a large output. According to the information available, the units normally employed are capable of producing about 100 kg. of HN03 per day, corresponding to an annual output of about 30 metric tons of HrT03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) per unit.With regard to the output of the modern types of non-regenerative platinum gauze converters, it appears that standard units are in use in Germany capable of providing sufficient nitrous fumes for the manufacture of 10,000 tons of chamber sulphuric acid per annum. (Metall und Erz, previously quoted.) If therequire-ments&apos;of the chamber process are taken at 0&quot;5 to 1 kg. of Chile nitrate per 100 kg. of concentrated sulphuric acid made, the output of the standard units would be equivalent to about 35 tons to 70 tons of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) per annum. According to other statements,  units   have  been
constructed with catalyst surfaces of 1,500 to 2,400 sq. cm. and capable of oxidising 165 to 330 gms. of ammonia per square centimetre of surface per day. In the case of a converter having a catalyst surface of 900 sq. cm. (approximately 1 sq. ft.) and a con-version and recovery efficiency of 90 per cent., the out-put would be of the order of 150 to 300 metric tons of HNOji (calculated as 100 per cent.) per annum.Tne evidence resulting from the research work carried out under the direction of the Experiments Sub-Committee indicates that outputs of this order should be attainable with converters of the size men-tioned above.There are considerable advantages attaching to the employment of platinum gauze converters having a large output of the order under discussion. In the first place, the lay-out of a large-scale ammonia oxida-tion plant is of a simpler character than when small units are used, and the cost of the converter section is reduced. In the second place, the amount of platinum gauze required for a plant of given capacity shows a substantial reduction as compared with the amount of platinum required for regenerative units of equal capacity.Power requirements.The catalytic oxidation of ammonia is accompanied by the evolution of. sufficient heat to maintain the catalyst at the reaction temperature. The power requirements are therefore small, even when electrical -cally heated catalysts are employed. Power is mainly necessary for the fans, blowers and pumps used for circulating the gases and the solutions in the absorption towers.: According to a statement published prior to the war, the power requirements of a small factory using regenerative converters were placed at about 0102 e.h.p.-year of 8,640 hours, or 136 k.w.-hours, per ton of HEOa (calculated as 100 per cent.) produced.An estimate recently supplied to the Sub-Coni-mittee for a large-scale factory using similar converters places the power requirements at 0-025 e.h.p.-year of about 50 weeks, or 154 k.w.-hours, per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) in the form of dilute acid.Evidence obtained from the research work carried out under the direction of the Experiments Sub-Committee tends to show that the power requirements when modern types of electrically&apos; controlled converters are employed do not exceed and may be somewhat lower than the figures given above.It appears probable, therefore, that an allowance of the order of 135 to 150 k.w.-hours per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 percent.) in the form of dilute acid would be adequate for a large-scale ammonia oxidation factory. These figures are equivalent to 0- 07 to 0-08 k.w.-year of 8,500 hours per metric ton of combined nitrogen in the form of dilute acid, and the latter value has been provisionally adopted by the Sub-Committee.THE ECONOMICS OF NITRIC ACID MANUFACTURE.In consequence of the fact that large-scale ammonia oxidation plants have only been established during the war period, it is difficult to get reliable figures as to the costs involved in operating the process with modern types of plant. It may also be noted that these plants have been erected for the sole purpose of meeting military requirements, and questions as to economy in construction and operation have been matters of minor importance&apos;.As previously stated, the process may be utilised for the production of dilute or concentrated nitric acid, and in considering the question of costs it is convenient to deal separately with the different sections Constituting a complete factory, namely:Converter and absorption (dilute acid) section;Acid concentrating section;Ammonia-producing section. The capital and working costs are&apos; therefore set out under separate headings below.Capital Cost of Converter and Absorption (DiluteAcid) Sections.   (Evidence.)Several figures were published&apos; prior to the war concerning the cost of small ammonia oxidation factories for producing dilute nitric acid (53 per cent.) and indicate a capital cost of the order of  10 per ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) per annum. (Iron and Coal Trades Review, May 23rd, 1913; Chemical Trade Journal, March 7th, 1914; Die Chemische Industrie, 1914, Vol. 37, p. 267.)A certain amount of additional information of more recent date has been collected by the Sub-Committee and may be summarised as follows:According to one witness the capital cost of .a large ammonia oxidation plant for producing dilute acid equivalent to approximately 20,000 tons of HNO;i (calculated as 100 per cent.) is given as  200,000 or about  10 per ton of HN03 per annum.A figure from another source for a large-scale factory quotes a capital cost of  7- 69 per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) per annum upon the basis of pre-war prices.Two detailed estimates for the cost of large-scale factories having outputs equivalent to over 20,000 tons and 10,000 tons of absolute acid respectively, indicate capital costs amounting to  4- 59 and  4- 78 per ton HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) per&apos; annum. According to these estimates the absorption towers and accessories account for about 50 per cent, of the total cost, and the converters and platinum for about 20 per cent. The figures are stated to be based upon modern Continental practice in respect of ammonia oxidation plant, but to have been modified in accordance with the prices prevailing in this country under pre-war conditions.. A figure of the same order, namely,  4&apos;5, is given in another statement, derived from a foreign source, dealing with the cost of a large plant having an annual output equivalent to 10,000 tons of absolute acid, 90 per cent, of the output being in the form of dilute acid and the other 10 per cent, in the form of sodium nitrite.The effect of the war conditions upon the cost of a large-scale installation is shown by the figures given in a detailed estimate supplied to the Sub-Committee by a foreign firm. On the basis of an annual output of dilute acid equivalent to 10,000 tons of absolute acid, the capital cost at the prices prevailing abroad at the date of the estimate (Jan., 1917), is quoted as  18-53 per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) per annum. The figure is exclusive of the cost of the ammonia section with its storage and boiler arrangements, the estimated cost of the latter bringing the total capital cost up to  21194 per metric ton of HN03 per annum. It is stated that the &quot;probable&quot; cost in this country under war conditions, including buildings, erection and freight, would amount to  19 per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) per annum for the complete installation, the converter and absorption sections accounting for  16- 28 and the ammonia-producing section for  2&apos;72. The absorp-tion towers and accessories represent about 45 per cent, of the total cost, and the converters and platinum about 18 per cent.Probable Cost of Converter  and  Absorption Sections.The principal items in the cost of an ammonia oxida-tion factory are represented by the absorption towers and by the converters and the initial supply of platinum, as is shown by the previous figures.The evidence available to the Sub-Committee indi-cates that recourse need not be had to costly granite towers of the type used in connection with arc furnace installations in Norway, and that stoneware towers of a much less expensive character can be employed. The utilisation of modern types of converter units having a large output, amounting to, say, 300 tons of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) per annum, also leads to a substantial reduction in the cost both of the converter section itself and of the initial supply of platinum. Definite evidence based upon quotations at war prices
or,0 *)has come to hand on tho latter points as the result of the research work carried out under the direction of the Experiments Sub-Committee.The figures for cost given above show a considerable variation, and reference has already been made to the difficulty of interpreting them in the light of pre-war conditions in this country. As the result, however, of a careful examination of all the evidence under review, the Sub-Committee is of the opinion that the capital cost of the converter and absorption tower sections of a large-scale ammonia oxidation factory embodying the best modern features and having an annual output of dilute acid (53 per cent.) equivalent to, say, 10,000 tons of HN&quot;03 (calculated as 100 percent.),should be of the order of  5 per metric ton of HNO;, (calculated as 100 per cent.) per annum on the basis of pre-war conditions in this country.This figure is equivalent to  22&apos; 5 per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum and has been provision-ally adopted by the Sub-Committee. For the reasons previously specified, it must be regarded as of a tentative character.Capital Cost of Concentrating Section. (Evidence).The only figures obtained by the Sub-Committee for the capital cost of the concentrating section of an ammonia oxidation plant are based upon foreign practice.According to one figure, whioh is stated to have been modified in accordance with pre-war conditions in this country, the capital cost is placed at about  2-18 per ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) per annum for a plant having an annual output of over 20,000 tons of strong (93 per cent.) acid.Another, figure in respect of a smaller plant having an output equivalent to 10,000 metric tons of strong acid indicates a capital cost of about  3&apos; 33 per metric ton of HNO3 (calculated as 100 per cent.) per annum.Probable Cost of Concentrating Section.In arriving at a conclusion as to the probable cost, the Sub-Committee has taken into account the capital cost of the concentrating section of an arc furnace installation, for which a figure of  5 per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) per annum has been adopted (Section III.). As previously noted, however, the primary product of the arc process is a . dilute acid of 30 to 40 per cent, strength as against an acid of about 53 per cent, strength in the case of the ammonia oxidation process. It is clear, therefore, that the preliminary evaporating plant necessary in the case of the arc process for bringing the dilute acid to a strength of about 50 per cent, prior to treatment in the main concentrating plant will not be required in the case of the acid obtained by the oxidation of ammonia.Taking this factor into account in connection with the evidence already given, the Sub-Committee baa adopted a figure of  3 per metric ton of HNO;, (calcu-lated as 100 per cent.), or  13 - 5 per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum for the capital cost of the concentrating section of an ammonia oxidation factory of the scale previously indicated, on the basis of pre-war conditions in this country.The total cost of the conversion, absorption, and concentrating sections of a large factory would thus amount to  8 per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) per annum, equivalent to  36 per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum in the form of concentrated acid.Probable Overall Capital Cost of complete Factory.The probable capital costs of complete factories for producing dilute (50 to 53 per cent.) or concentrated (93 to 96 per cent.) nitric acid on a large scale are obtained by adding the figures previously adopted to the cost of an ammonia-producing plant. The costs of such plants are given in Sections IL, IV., and VI.It may be noted that an overall efficiency of 90 per cent, has been taken in respect of the converter and absorption sections, thus necessitating an ammonia section having a capacity of 0- 3 metric ton per unit capacity of the dilute nitric acid section of the factory. In the case of a factory for producing concentrated nitric acid, allowance has been made for a margin of 3 per cent, in the capacities of the ammonia and dilute acid sections in order to compensate for losses of com-bined nitrogen during the concentrating stage.An example may be given to illustrate the method employed in&apos; arriving at the figures set out in the table.&quot;example.

Production Costs of Dilute Acid. (Evidence)The figures given below relate to the costs involved in the oxidation of ammonia and in the absorption of the nitrous fumes for the production of dilute (50 to 53 per cent,) nitric acid, and are exclusive of the cost of the ammonia. The overall costs of production are given later.According to a detailed statement which was pub-lished prior to the war, the working costs of a small-scale factory including an ammonia section are given as  5-56 per ton of HNOii (calculated as 100 per cent.) in the form of dilute acid. If the figures are modified to exclude the working costs of the ammonia section and interest on capital, they indicate that the cost of converting the ammonia into dilute nitric acid, inclusive of depreciation at 10 per cent., is approxi-mately  3&apos;2 per ton of HNO;i in the form of dilute acid.Other pre-war figures indicate production costs of the order of  4-7 and  3-9 per metric ton of HNO:! (calculated as 100 per cent.) exclusive of interest on capital.More recent figures have been collected by the Sub-Committee, and show a considerable lack of uniformity as will be seen from the statements below.According to one source of evidence, the cost of conversion for a large-scale plant amounts to  14; 5 per metric ton of combined nitrogen, or  3-22 per metric ton of HNO:i (calculated as 100 per cent.) in the form of dilute acid. This figure includes an allowance for depreciation, but does not take any account of losses of combined nitrogen during the conversion. tAnother statement under review places the cost of conversion at  4-5 per ton of HN03 in the case of a plant having an annual output of about 20,000 tons of HNO;, (calculated as 100 per cent.) in the form of 50 per cent. acid.On the other hand, some evidence available as to the position in Germany during the early part of 191.6 indicates that the cost of conversion into dilute acid may amount to about  8&apos; 5 per metric ton of combined nitrogen, or  1 - 89 per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.).The two detailed estimates for large-scale factories referred to in connection with capital costs quote con-version costs of the order of  1-36 and  1-43 per ton of HN&quot;03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) in the form of 53 per cent. acid. These figures include amortization at 10 per cent., and liberal allowances for repairs and general charges.Another figure derived from a foreign source places the cost of conversion at about  1 - 61 per metric ton of HNO;. (calculated as 100 per cent.), about 90 per cent, of the combined nitrogen being recovered in the form of dilute acid, and the remainder as sodium nitrite. The figure includes an allowance for amortization and for the cost of evaporating and packing the nitrite, It is exclusive, however, of the cost of the soda required for the alkaline absorption towers and of losses of ammonia during the process of conversion.The remaining figures under review were given in the estimate dealing with the &quot; probable &quot; cost of a large-scale factory in this country under war conditions. The conversion costs alone are given as follows :HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) per metric ton. -  Shillings.Power requirements: 0-025 e.h.p.year, at 11-25 per e.h.p. year      .... 5-G2Wages (50 workmen)    -     -     -     -     - 11-25Upkeep -     - 4-50Regeneration of platinum     -     -     -     - 2-81Salaries, office expenses, etc. -     -     . 9-0033-18Amortization at 10 per cent, on &quot;probable&quot; cost of converter and absorption sections only , - .     . 32-50T.ta]      r-   . &apos;  V - 05-74&quot;&quot;&apos;=  3-287&apos; \... -The estimate relates to a plant using the regenerative typo of converter unit, and apart from the heavy item for amortization on the &quot; probable&quot; capital cost under war conditions, the above figures point to a compara-tively low working cost. If the figures are modified on the lines of the capital cost tentatively adopted by the Sub-Committee, namely,  5 per metric ton of HNO3 per annum, and the cost of energy is taken at 0-25(1. per k.w.-hour ( 9 per k.w.-year of 8,640 hours), the working costs including amortization at 10 per cent, would be reduced to  2-045 per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.).Probable Production Costs of Dilute Acid.The ammonia oxidation process involves the circu-lation of comparatively large volumes of gases and the recovery of oxides of nitrogen therefrom, and in these respects has a close analogy with the arc process. The figure adopted for the working costs of. the latter process was  2 - 5 per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 10O per cent.) in the form of dilute acid, and included an item for amortization at 8 per cent, on the heavy capital cost of the chemical section of the installation.   (Section III.).The two processes are somewhat similar in opera-tion, and the corresponding charges for labour and superintendence would probably be of the same order, especially with modern types of ammonia oxidation plant employing converters of large capacity with electrical control. Similar remarks apply to the question of repairs, although the upkeep of the con-verters and the renewal of the platinum catalyst would probably be somewhat less costly than the upkeep of the arc furnaces.Apart, therefore, from the item for amortization, it would appear that the working costs of a large-scale&apos; ammonia oxidation factory should not exceed those of an arc furnace installation of similar capacity.As the result of a careful examination of the figures reviewed in the preceding paragraph,, and in the light of the above considerations, the Sub-Com-mittee is of the opinion that the working costs of the converter and absorption sections of a large-scale ammonia oxidation factory embodying the best modern . features should not exceed  2 per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) in the form of dilute acid (50 to 53 per cent.), or  9 per metric ton of combined nitrogen.This figure represents the costs of conversion upon the basis of pre-war conditions in this country, and is inclusive of power requirements at, say, 0-25d. per lew.-hour, and of amortization at the rate of 10 per cent, on the tentative capital cost previously adopted. It is exclusive, however, of interest on capital and of losses of ammonia during the conversion.Cost of Concentrating Dilute Acid.In consequence of the absence of any body of waste, heat in the gases resulting from the oxidation of ammonia, the concentration of the dilute acid to a strength of, say, 93 to 96 per cent., has to be effected by the employment of fuel. The costs are therefore likely to be somewhat greater than in. the case of the arc process (Section III.), although the dilute acid from the latter process is weaker than that obtained by the ammonia oxidation process.According to figures published prior to the war, the cost of concentrating the dilute acid is of the order of  2 and  2-76 per ton of HNO, (calculated as 100 per cent.).Other figures of more recent date and from a variety of sources place the cost at  2-33,  2-5 and  2-77 per ton of HN03, (calculated as 100 per cent.) in the form of strong acid, inclusive of amortizationTaking into account the corresponding costs in the case of the arc process, the Sub-Committee considers that an allowance of  2-5 per metric ton of HNOs (calculated as 100 per cent.) including amortization at 10 per cent, would be reasonable for a large-scale plant upon the basis of pre-war conditions, and this figure has been adopted.
The equivalent value per metric ton of combined nitrogen is  11-25, thus bringing the total working costs for oxidation and concentration to  20-25 per metric ton of combined nitrogen or  4&apos;5 per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) in the form of strong acid (93 to- 96 per cent.), exclusive of interest on capital, of losses of ammonia during the dilute acid stage, and of losses of combined nitrogen during the concentrating stage.Overall Production Costs oi Dilute and Con-centrated Acid.The table given below indicates, in a comparative manner, the estimated costs of manufacturing dilute (50 to 53 per cent.) and concentrated (93 to 96 per cent.) nitric acid on a large scale from synthetic and by-product ammonia on the basis of pre-war con-ditions. .In the case of synthetic ammonia, the figures for cost are taken from previous sections of the Appendix (Sections IV, and VI.) and represent the estimated manufacturing costs inclusive of losses.In the case of by-product ammonia, the figures have been derived from the pre-war market price of sulphate as given in Section II., and an allowance of  7 per metric ton of ammonia has been added for the cost of concentration and purification. Account has also been taken of the loss of ammonia, amounting to 5 per cent., during the working up of the crude liquor.The overall efficiency of the conversion and absorp-tion sections has been taken at 90 per cent, thus in-volving the employment of 0 - 3 metric ton of ammonia per &quot;metric ton of HNO;t (calculated as 100 per cent.) produced in the form of dilute acid.  With regard tothe production costs of concentrated acid, an allowance of 3 per cent, has been added to the total costs incurred up to the stage of dilute acid in order to compensate for losses of combined nitrogen during the concon-trating sUtge.The following example illustrates the method em-ployed in arriving at the figures given in the tablev *Mxam/de.

They are exclusive, however, of any allowance for interest on thecapital coat of the chemical installations.In the case of the manufacture of dilute and con-centrated nitric acid by a combination of the continuous cyanamide and ammonia oxidation processes, it will be seen that every additional  1 per k.w.-year increases the production costs by about  0 - 52 per metric ton of HNO3 (calculated as 100 per cent.). The influence of the cost of energy up to  6 per k.w.-year upon theproduction costs is shown on Chart B at the end of the Appendix.The cost of manufacturing concentrated (90 per cent.) nitric acid in this country from Chile nitrate by the retort process amounted to about  22 - 33 per metric ton of HNO;t (calculated as 100 per cent.) under pre-war conditions.   (Section. I,)
THE  MANUFACTURE OF SYNTHETIC NITRATES.A brief indication will now tie given as to the possibilities attaching to the manufacture of nitrates, such as lime nitrate and sodium nitrate, from the dilute acid obtained by the oxidation of ammonia. For this purpose use will be made of the relevant figm-es quoted in Section III. (pp. 24*2 and 243) when dealing with the manufacture of nitrates by means of the arc process.Capital Cost o  Nitrate Section.The plant required for the conversion of dilute acid into lime nitrate (13 per cent. N) and for packing the product entails, as already noted (Section III.), a capital outlay of  22 * 55 per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum, or  2-93 per metric ton of lime nitrate (13 per cent. N) per annum for a large-scale installation.The capital outlay would probably be somewhat lower in connection with the manufacture of sodium nitrate owing to the packing installation being of a less elaborate character, but no definite information is available upon this point.Overall Capital Cost of Complete Factory.The following table indicates the probable overall capital costs of large-scale factories for manufacturing lime nitrate by the ammonia oxidation process. The figures are obtained by adding the capital cost of a nitrate section per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum to the corresponding capital costs of factories for producing dilute nitric acid as given in the table in page 267. No allowance has been made for the small loss of combined nitrogen involved in the conversion of the dilute acid into lime nitrate.ESTIMATED CAPITAL COSTS OF LIME NITRATE FACTORIES.Nature of Ammonia-producing Section of Lime Nitrate Factory.	  per metric ton per Annum.

If vacuum evaporating pans were employed, the fuel requirements would bo substantially lower.The above observations will now be considered in connection1 with the figures for the cost of manu-facturing nitrates given in Section III., and with those for the cost of manufacturing dilute nitric acid by the ammonia oxidation process.Lime Nitrate. If allowance is made for a loss of combined nitrogen amounting to about 2 - 5 per cent, during the conversion of dilute acid into nitrate, every metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) neutralized yields 1-67 metric tons of lime nitrate (13 per cent. N). The charges for lime and limestone ( 0-202) and for casks for packing the product ( 1-25), will be the same as in the case of the arc process, but an increased allowance of, say,  0-75 per metric ton of nitrate must be made in respect of labour, repairs, expenses and depreciation on account of the extra labour entailed by the use of fuel for evaporating purposes. Taking into account the cost of the fuel ( 0*085 per ton of HN03 neutral-ized), the total working costs amount to  2 - 253 per metric ton of lime nitrate (13 per cent. NbThe table given on page 271 indicates the estimated production costs at large-scale nitrate factories com-prising ammonia oxidation sections for manufacturing the dilute nitric acid.An example may be given to illustrate the method employed in arriving at the figures for lime nitrate set out in the table.Example: Overall production costs of packed, lime nitrate at a factory utilising by-product ammonia for the manufacture of dilute nitric acid by the oxidation process.Lime Nitrate (13 per cent.

Allowing for a loss of about 2*5 per cent, as before, every metric ton of HN03 (calcu-lated as 100 per cent.) neutralized will yield 1-39 metric tons of sodium nitrate (15*6 per cent. N) (Section III.). The charges for soda ash at  3 per ton ( 1*815) and for bags ( 0*25) will be the same as in the case of the arc process, and an increased allow-ance of  0*75 per metric ton of nitrate will be taken as before for labour, repairs, expenses and depreciation. Taking account of the cost of fuel ( 0*085 per metric ton of HNO;, neutralized) the total working expenses amount to  2*876 per metric ton of sodium nitrate (15*6 per cent. N).The table on page 271 indicates the estimated production costs at large-scale nitrate factories com-prising ammonia oxidation sections for manufacturing the dilute nitric acid.An example may be given to illustrate the method employed in arriving at the figures for sodium nitrate set out in the table.
nitrogen in the form of packed sodium nitrate (15*6 per cent. N).In the case of the manufacture of nitrates by a combination of the continuous cyanamide and ammonia oxidation processes, it will be seen that every additional  1 per lew.-year increases the production costs by, about  0-3 per metric ton of lime nitrate and by about  0&quot; 38 per metric ton of sodium nitrate. The influence of the cost of energy up to  6 per k.w.-year upon the cost of manufacturing these products is shown on Chart B at the end of tho Appendix.The costs involved in the manufacture of ammonium nitrate by the ammonia oxidation process are dealt with in Section VIII.The pre-war market price of calcium nitrate in this country amounted to  9:75 per long ton, or  9 - 59 per metric ton, equivalent in the case of a nitrogen content of 13 per cent, to  73-8 per metric ton of combined nitrogen.The pre-war market price (average 1911-13) of Chile nitrate amounted to  10*52 per metric ton, or  67&apos; 21 per metric ton of combined nitrogen.ESTIMATED PRODUCTION COSTS OP LIME AND SODIUM NITRATE.Source of Ammonia, and cost of dilute Nitric Acid obtained therefrom in   per metric ton of HN03.

Converters have been extensively used for this purpose in Germany during the war period, and, according to the information avail-able, the consumption of combined nitx-ogen is no greater than when Chile nitrate is employed.In view of the fact that the oxides of nitrogen from the converter can be passed directly into the sulphuric acid chambers, the expensive absorption towers required for recovering nitric acid are rendered un-necessary. Moreover, a few small converters will meet the requirements of a large sulphuric acid works, so that the installation of ammonia oxidation plant is - a comparatively simple and inexpensive matter. For example, if the requirements of the sulphuric acid plant are taken at 0-5 to 1 kg. of Chile nitrate per 100 kg. of concentrated sulphuric acid produced, a small converter using a tew square inches of platinum gauze as a catalyst will have an output of oxides of nitrogen sufficient for an annual production of about10,000 tons of sulphuric acid. In the case of a larger annual production, a number of the small converter units can be employed, although larger single units can be used if desired.According to the statistics collected by the Econo-mics Sub-Committee, the average yearly consumption of Chile nitrate for the manufacture of sulphuric acid during the pre-war period amounted to over 18,000 tons or nearly one-seventh of the total imports of this material. The substitution of the ammonia oxidation process for the present methods&apos; would, upon the basis of a conversion efficiency of 90 per cent., entail the consumption of about 3,800 tons of ammonia per annum, equivalent to about 15,200 tons of ammonium sulphate (25 per cent. NED,) or less than 4 per cent, of the average annual production prior to the war.The research carried out under the direction of the Experiments Sub-Committee has already resulted in the commercial installation of an ammonia oxidation converter for the above purpose by a well-known firm of chemical manufacturers in this country, and the reports received indicate that the apparatus is workiug in a very satisfactory manner.
979KtTltOrtKN PltObUOfH do MM If TEE i FINAL REl-Olfl1.SECTION VIII.AMMONIUM   NITRATE,Prior to the war the manufacture of ammonium nitrate was carried out only on a comparatively small scale on account of the limited applications of the material to industrial purposes, Considerable attention has been given to the possibility of utilising ammonium nitrate as a fertiliser on account of its high content of nitrogen (35 per cent.), and the consequent economy in packing and transport. The endeavours hitherto made in this direction, however, have not succeeded in overcoming the drawbacks due to the solubility and deliquescent properties of the nitrate.As a direct outcome of the enormous demand for explosives under existing conditions and of the lirriita-tions governing the manufacture of aromatic nitro-compounds, the ammonium nitrate industry has assumed a position of outstanding importance during the war period.The normal method of making the nitrate by the neutralization of dilute nitric acid was found to be unsuitable for coping with the demand, and other methods dispensing with the necessity for the preli-minary manufacture of nitric acid were therefore resorted to. Technical difficulties of considerable magnitude have had to be overcome in developing some of the newer methods of manufacture in order to obtain a product of the requisite degree of purity and an adequate yield. Prom the economic aspect some of the new processes can only be regarded as war emergency measures. They are worthy of descrip-tion, however, as an illustration of the developments occasioned by the requirements for munitions.METHODS OF MANUFACTURE.The following account gives a brief summary of the various methods of manufacture that have been employed or are still in operation in this country.By Neutralization Process.For the normal method of manufacture already referred to, the dilute acid obtained by means of the ai&apos;c process or the ammonia oxidation pi^ocess is well adapted, and can be neutralized with by-product ammonia or cyanamide ammonia. If by-product ammonia is employed, it must be freed from sulphur and organic impurities in order that the resulting am-ammonium nitrate may be sufficiently stable for explosives purposes.The process is a simple one, but the corrosive action of the nitrate solution upon most metals leads to heavy wear and tear of the evaporating pans. It has been stated that aluminium withstands the action of the solution, but the employment of this metal makes the plant somewhat costly.An ingenious modification of the process has been devised whereby the necessity for evaporation is avoided. According to this method gaseous ammonia is passed into strong nitric acid under such conditions that neutral ammonium nitrate is formed, the heat of reaction driving off practically all the water and melting the solid product which can be run off and allowed to solidify. The pans in this case are lined with resistant brick, but the corrosion is nevertheless heavy. In addition, the process appears to be attended with appreciable losses.The methods described below enable ammonium nitrate to . be manufactured from Chile nitrate or calcium nitrate without necessitating the preliminary manufacture of nitric acid. t,By the Interaction of Calcium Nitrate and Ammonium Carbonate.This reaction pi*oceeds quantitatively, the purity of the resulting ammonium nitrate depending upon that of the original calcium nitrate.   The latter can beobtained by the neutralization of dilute acid with limestone, as in the arc process, or by the double decomposition of Chile nitrate and calcium chloride.By a Modification of the Ammonia-Soda Process.The ordinary ammonia-soda process is modified by substituting Chile nitrate for sodium chloride, the ammonium nitrate being separated from the liquor by evaporation after the removal of the sodium bicarbonate. Technical difficulties have been encountered in con-nection with the conversion ratio of Chile nitrate to ammonium nitrate, in the separation of the latter from the other products, and owing to the accumulation of impurities in the mother liquor.By the Interaction of Chile Nitrate and Ammo-nium Sulphate.The successful development of this method of manufacturing ammonium nitrate by double decom-position has been accomplished after a detailed examination of the solubility phases of the reaction and of the temperatures necessary to prevent the formation of double salts.It may be noted that the process involves the loss of sulphuric acid which goes to waste in the form of sodium sulphate.Observations.The new methods, in general, involve reactions which proceed to an equilibrium, thus resulting in losses of the combined nitrogen of the initial reagent, and also leading to difficulty in the separation of ammonium nitrate of the requisite degree of purity. Trouble is also experienced on account of the corrosive action of the nitrate solution, as previously mentioned.The developments that have occurred during the war period will probably lead to the increased employ -ment of ammonium nitrate in connection with ex-plosives for mining purposes after the war. There is no doubt that efforts will also be made to overcome the difficulties hitherto preventing the successful employment of the material as a fertiliser on account of the very large market that would be opened up.THE ECONOMICS OF AMMONIUM NITRATE MANUFACTURE BY NEUTRALIZATION PROCESS.Consideration will be given, in the first instance, to the costs incurred in the manufacture of ammonium nitrate by the normal or neutralization process, as this was in operation prior to the war, and some definite pre-war figures are available.In dealing with the question of costs, it is con-venient to remember that the salt contains ammonia nitrogen and nitric nitrogen in equal proportions. The cost of a ton of combined nitrogen in the form of ammonium nitrate is therefore equivalent to the added costs of half a ton of combined nitrogen in the form of ammonia, and of half a ton in the form of dilute nitric acid, together with the cost of neutralizing, evaporating, etc., and with an allowance for losses during the process. ;Capital Cost of Nitrate Section (Evidence).The figures given below deal with the cost of plant for neutralizing, evaporating, and in some cases packing, and are exclusive of the ammonia-producing and nitric acid sections required for a complete factory,According to two statements published prior to the war, the capital costs of large nitrate plants to be used in connection with an arc furnace installation are
given as  614 and  6&apos; 5 per ton of combined nitrogen per annum, equivalent respectively to  2&apos;24 and  2&quot; 27 per ton of ammonium nitrate per annum,The following figures of more recent date have also been obtained by the Sub-Oommittee. ;i In one case the capital cost for a large ammonium nitrate installation on the basis of pre-war prices is given as  6 * 2 per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annum, or  2117 per metric ton of ammonium nitrate per annum.A detailed estimate which was stated to be based on modern Continental practice and upon the prices prevailing in this country prior to the war, indicates the following figures for a plant producing over 10,000 tons of ammonium nitrate per annuin.Ammonium Nitrate per ton per annum.

Taking this item into account, the Sub-Committee is of the opinion that a figure of  7 per metric ton of combined nitrogen per annuin, or  2 - 45 per metric ton of ammonium nitrate per annum, should be adequate for the pre-war capital cost of a large-scale ammonium nitrate section.Overall Cost of Complete Factory.It is obvious that many variations arc possible in respect of the nitric &quot;acid and ammonia sections of a complete ammonium nitrate factory. For example, the nitric acid may be obtained from Chile nitrate plant, an arc furnace installation, or an ammonia oxidation plant, while the ammonia may be obtained from by-product sources, from cyanamide, or by means of the Haber process.The table below deals with a few of the more important variations and indicates, in a comparative manner, the probable order of the overall capital costs of large-scale factories on the basis of pre-war con-ditions. It has been assumed that ammonium nitrate of a high degree of purity would be manufactured, thus involving the use of purification plant for the ammonia when the by-product source is relied upon. The figures are based upon those given in previous sections (Sections I., II., III., IV., VI., and VII.) for the cost of installations for producing dilute nitric acid and ammonia, and upon that adopted above for the cost of an ammonium nitrate section.An example may be given to illustrate the method employed in arriving at the figures set out in the table, and it should be noted that no allowance has been made for the small losses of combined nitrogen involved in the conversion of dilute acid into amino-nium nitrate.Example.

A perusal of the above figures indicates that tho capital outlay is large in the case of all the purely synthetic processes. In tho case of an ammonia oxidation plant utilising by-product ammonia or pro-vided with a cyanamide conversion section only, the capital costs are much lower, and are on a parity with those incurred if ammonium nitrate is manufactured from Chile nitrate and by-product ammonia. In the two latter cases no account is taken of the capital necessary to produce the Chile nitrate or the by-product ammonia.Conversion Costs (Evidence)..: The neutralization process is a comparatively simple one, and, judging by analogy with other manufacturing operations of a similar character, the conversion costs should not be very large, apart from the question of repairs. The latter item, however, is likely to be a fairly heavy one on account of the corrosive action of the solution on the evaporating pans.Some figures were published prior to the war con-cerning the manufacture of ammonium nitrate from the dilute nitric acid obtained by the ammonia oxidation and arc processes. In the former case, conversion costs of the order of  2 - 24 and  2 - 94 per ton of am-motiium nitrate were quoted for small-scale plants. In the latter case the cost was given as  1-26 for a large-scale plant, and as  2*1 for a plant of unspecified size.A more recent statement, which comes from&apos; a Norwegian source, indicates a conversion cost of  5- 25 per metric ton of combined nitrogen, or  1- 84 per metric ton of nitrate, in the case of a plant having a large output and utilising nitric acid of 50 per cent, strength. The cost is on the basis of pre-war prices, and probably includes an allowance for packing.According to a detailed estimate relating to the manufacture of ammonium nitrate on a scale of over 10,000 tons per annum, the conversion costs on the basis of pre-war conditions are placed at about  1126 per ton of nitrate.Another figure from a foreign source concerning a large-scale ammonia oxidation and ammonium nitrate plant places the conversion cost, including packing, at  2 16 per metric ton of ammonium nitrate.The only other figures under review were in the form of an estimate of the probable working costs based upon the costs incurred in manufacturing operations of a similar character. It was assumed that ammonia spirit (25 per cent. NH3) and dilute nitric acid of 40 per cent, strength were employed, and in dealing with the quantity of solution to be evaporated allowance was made for the occurrence of a loss of 215 per cent, of the combined nitrogen during the con-version. Taking into account the fuel requirements, and the probable charges for labour, repairs, general expenses and amortization oh the basis of pre-war conditions, a tentative figure of  1&apos; 65 per ton of nitrate was arrived at for the conversion costs, exclusive of packing. It may be noted that the fuel requirements were based upon the assumed employment of open evaporating pans, and would be substantially lower if vacuum pans were used.Probable Conversion Costs.In view of the variations shown in the figures given above, and of the rapid developments in large-scale manufacture that have occurred during the war period, it is not easy to arrive at a reliable figure for the cost of conversion.As the result of a careful examination of all the evidence available, the Sub-Committee has come to the conclusion that the figure of  1- 65 per metric ton of ammonium nitrate can be taken as a close approxi-mation to the conversion costs likely txr- be incurred under pre-war conditions in the working of a large-scale plant. The figure is equivalent to  4- 71 per metric ton of combined nitrogen, and has been taken as exclusive of any allowance for losses of combined nitrogen during the conversion, or of interest on capital.The employment of fuel would be unnecessary in the case of the manufacture of ammonium nitrate atan arc furnace installation, as the waste heat from the furnace gases would more than suffice for evaporating purposes. The saving effected would probably reduce the cost of conversion to about  1&apos; 5 per metric ton of nitrate, or  4&apos; 28 per metric ton pf combined nitrogen. This tentative figure is utilised below in dealing with the overall production costs at an arc process plant.Overall Production Costs.The table on page 275 is on the linos of that given previously in connection with capital costs, and serves to illustrate the probable order of the overall production costs at large-scale ammonium nitrate factories.According to the evidence available, the losses of combined nitrogen during the neutralization process are not very large, but an allowance of 2&apos; 5 per cent, has been included in the figures given below. It has been assumed that a pure product is manufactured, thus involving a charge for the purification of by-product ammonia when this source is relied upon.An example may be given to illustrate the method employed in arriving at the figures set out in the table.Example.

N);Prom the table of estimated production costs on page 275 it will be seen that, in the case of the manufacture of ammonium nitrate at an arc furnace installation using by-product ammonia for the neu-tralization stage, every additional  1 per k.w.-year increases the production costs by about  1*5 per metric ton of ammonium nitrate. The influence of the cost of energy up to  6 per k.w.-year upon the manufacturing costs is shown on Chart A at the end of the Appendix.If a combination of the continuous cyanamide and ammonia oxidation processes is employed, it will be seen that every additional  1 per k.w.-year increases the production costs by about  0&apos; 8 per metric ton of ammonium nitrate. The influence of the cost of energy up to  6 per k.w.-year upon the manufacturing costs is shown on Chart B at the end of the Appendix.It is interesting to observe that processes de-pending upon the use of Chile nitrate or by-product ammonia are characterized by the highest production costs and &quot;compare unfavourably with the purely synthetic processes. The influence of cheap ammonia from which cheap nitric acid can be obtained by means of the ammonia oxidation process is shown to a marked degree.The pre-war market price of ammonium nitrate amounted to  35 - 75 per long ton, equivalent to  35 -18 per metric ton or  100-5 per metric ton of combined nitrogen.

The figures given above represent the estimated factory costs of the product inclusive of all working expenses, of amortization, and of losses of combined nitrogen,   They are exclusive, however, of any allowance for interest on the capital costs of the chemical installations.THE ECONOMICS OF THE NEWER PROCESSES.The development of double decomposition processes for the manufacture of ammonium nitrate must be regarded as a war emergency measure for coping with the continually increasing military requirements without the necessity for the preliminary manufacture of nitric acid. In view of the rapid extension of the processes and of the importance of prompt production, there has been little opportunity of definitely settling the questions as to the best type of plant and the best conditions of working.A brief description of the various processes has already been given (see p. 272), and it will suffice to re-call the fact that they are all attended with losses of combined nitrogen.The Sub-Committee has no information as to the capital cost of the plant required for the double decomposition processes, and very few details are available as to the costs of production. The figures given below are based upon information supplied by the Explosives Department.Double Decomposition of Calcium Nitrate and Ammonium Carbonate.Detailed figures based upon several months working indicate that the conversion costs for this process amount to about  3 - 9 per ton of ammonium nitrate, exclusive of capital charges, packing and losses of combined nitrogen.Assuming a capital cost of the order of  5 per ton of nitrate per annum and making deductions from the various items for the increased cost of manufactureunder present conditions, the figures indicate a pro-bable pre-war conversion cost of  2-75 per ton of nitrate, exclusive of packing and of losses of combined nitrogen, or  7-86 per ton of combined nitrogen. According to the information available, the losses amount to about 10 per cent.An approximate idea of the cost of ammonium nitrate manufactured by this process may be obtained by taking the pre-ivar market prices of calcium nitrate and of pure ammonia spirit in conjunction with the above figures.i   Combined Nitrogen as Ammonium Nitrate .

Modified Ammonia-Soda Process.The conversion costs for this process appear to be approximately of the same order as those previously given, and the losses of combined nitrogen amount to about 10 per cent,Taking the pre-war market prices of Chile nitrate and of pure ammonia spirit in conjunction with the conversion cost given above, the approximate cost of ammonium nitrate manufactured by this process would be as follows, apart from any credit for the sodium bicarbonate obtained as a by-product:Combined Nitrogen as Ammonium Nitrate Cost per metric ton.Chile nitrate (15&apos;6/5 per cent.

N).The cost would be reduced by some  3 or  4 per metric ton of combined nitrogen if credit is allowed for the sodium bicarbonate. t,Double Decomposition of Chile Nitrate and Am-ammonium Sulphate.The Sub-Committee has no definite information as to the costs involved in this process. It is known, however, that considerable care is necessary as regardsthe temperatures at which the reaction is carried out, and it seems probable that the requirements in con-nection with evaporation and crystallization are at least as great as in the other processes. It should also be noted that the process must be debited with the cost of sulphuric acid.Assuming, for purposes of comparison, that the conversion costs are of the same order as in the previous cases, and that the losses of combined nitrogen amount to 10 per cent., the approximate cost of ammonium nitrate manufactured by this process on tho basis . of pre-war market pi-ices would be as follows :Combined Nitrogen as Ammonium Nitrate Cost per metric ton.Chile nitrate (as in previous ex-ample) : 0-5 metric  ton   combined nitrogen at  67*21    -     .

They may be compared with the figures previously given for the pre-war market price of ammonium nitrate, and for the estimated cost of manufacture by other processes.note.-Since the above figures were compiled by the Processes Sub-Committee, further experience in the manufacture of ammonium nitrate by double decomposition processes has resulted in a considerable reduction in the losses of combined nitrogen. The Committee has been informed by the Explosives Supply Department that the loss should not exceed about 5 per cent, under good working conditions, as compared with the allowance of 10 per cent, taken by the Sub-Committee.
SECTION IX.THE HAUSSER 01? EXPLOSION PROCESS,The Hausser process for the fixation of atmo-spheric nitrogen depends upon the fact that the temperature attained by exploding a mixture of a combustible gas and air or oxygen under proper con-ditions is sufficient to cause the direct union of a small proportion of the nitrogen and oxygen present. It is also claimed that liquid combustibles, such as crude oil in a fine state of division, can be utilised for the process. The primary product is dilute nitric acid as in the case of the arc process.According to a patent taken out in this country in 1906, it appears that Hausser originally contemplated the employment of an explosion engine for carrying out the process, the energy of the explosion being utilised for performing external work. It was also proposed to supplement the cooling of the products of explosion during the expansion stage by injecting a cooling agent, such as water, into the engine cylinder with the object of preventing the dissociation of the nitric oxide in the gases. In Hausser&apos;s later patents reference is made to the wear of the valve gear of the engine, and other forms of apparatus for carrying out the process are described.It is not clear whether trials were originally made with an explosion engine, and all the available evidence dealing with the experimental work upon the process indicates that a stationary explosion vessel or bomb has been employed, the admission of the ingredients of the explosive mixture and the exhaust of the corn-combustion products being controlled by mechanically operated valve gear.A fair amount of information concerning the pro-cess has been at the disposal of the Sub-Committee, and special reference may be made to a detailed report supplied to the Department from an Allied source. This report contains an account of the Hausser installation at Heeringen, near Hamm, in Westphalia, a description of the system of operation, and details of independent tests carried out at the works by experts. A summary of the information in this report is given later.THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS.The Hausser process represents an attempt to solve the problem of effecting the direct union of atmospheric nitrogen and oxygen without the expendi-ture of the large amount of electrical energy required by the arc process. Reliance upon energy liberated by the explosion of gases in closed vessels imposes a number of limitations to the process, and a brief examination of their general character must therefore be made.As the process is essentially a thermal one, the factors determining the formation of nitric oxide are the temperature and the partial pressures of the nitro-gen and oxygen in the burnt gases resulting from the explosion. According to the law of mass-action, the explosion pressure as such is without effect upon the reaction, since the union of oxygen and nitrogen does not involve any change in the number of mole-cules present.Assuming that the explosion temperature is main-tained for a sufficient length of time to ensure the attainment of equilibrium conditions in the formation of nitric oxide, the relation between the concentra-tions or partial pressures of nitric oxide, nitrogen and oxygen in the products of combustion will be given by the equation:[NO]2 = K[N2] [OJ. where K is a constant for a given temperature and independent of the composition of the burnt gases. As the formation of nitric oxide is an endothermic reaction, the value of the equilibrium-constant K in-creases with an increase in the temperature.Use of Aii-Gas Mixtures.Dealing first with the employment of simple air-gas mixtures, the highest working temperature and the maximum value of K will be obtained by using a rich explosive mixture consisting of a combustible gas of a high calorific value with the minimum quantity of combustion air, the mixture being compressed and pre-heated to the maximum degree consistent with safe working.Under these conditions of operation, however, the burnt gases will contain the minimum proportion of nitrogen, and little or no free oxygen, so that the value of the product of their partial pressures will be a minimum. In order to increase the value of this product, it is necessary to employ a larger proportion of air in the explosive mixture, but this results in a decrease in the maximum temperature attainable, and consequently in a fall in the value of the equilibrium-constant K.It can be shown that these opposing factors lead to an increasing concentration of nitric oxide as the initial mixture is progressively diluted. The concen-tration, however, attains a maximum value at a definite dilution, depending upon the nature of the combustible gas and the conditions of operation, and beyond this stage the concentration diminishes.It is important to note that the partial pressures of &apos; nitrogen and oxygen in the products obtained by ex-ploding a mixture of air and gas are in all cases less than the corresponding partial pressures for air alone. On account of this limiting factor, the maximum con-centration of nitric oxide obtainable by an explosion process using an air-gas mixture will be lower than -that obtainable by heating air alone to the correspond-ing explosion temperature, as is apparent from the above equation.Influence of Added Oxygen.The above observations are subject to certain modifications if explosive mixtures containing the minimum quantity of combustion air are enriched by the addition of pure oxygen.   Taking the per-centage of residual oxygen in the burnt products from a definite volume of combustible gas as a basis of comparison, it is clear that enriched mixtures will give higher explosion temperatures- than equivalent air-gas mixtures, so that the values of the equilibiium-constant K will also be higher.   Moreover, a pro-gressive increase in the proportion of residual oxygen in the case of enriched mixtures has less influence in diminishing the explosion temperatures, owing to the avoidance of dilution with nitrogen, so that the value of K also decreases less rapidly,   On the other hand, the partial pressure of the nitrogen in the burnt pro-ducts will be less for enriched mixtures and will continue to diminish as the proportion of residual oxygen increases.These opposing factors have a similar effect to that previously indicated, causing the concentration of nitric oxide to attain a maximum value at a definite stage of enrichment, this value and all intermediate values being greater than those for equivalent air-gas mixtures.   The attainment of the maximum value, however, necessitates a much larger percentage of residual oxygen in the burnt gases than is required for the attainment of the maximum value with an air-gas nuxture.    From an examination of the possibilities attaching to the use of a typical coke-oven gas for the Hausser process, it appears that the concentrations of nitric oxide theoretically attainable by the employment of enriching oxygen up to and even beyond the optimum  conditions are lower than the thermal equilibrium concentrations for air alone when heated to the corresponding explosion temperatures.
Concentration of Nitric Oxide in Gases.Except under special conditions, the temperatures obtained by exploding combustible mixtures in closed vessels will range up to, say, 2,000&quot; C. to 2,500o C, and, according to Nernsfs table of equilibrium constants, the maximum possible concentrations of nitric oxide for air at these temperatures only amount to from 1 per cent, to 2- 6 per cent, by volume. Apart, therefore, from any modifying factors due to in-complete combustion, dissociation of the explosion products, and inequalities in the distribution of temperature, it would appear that the amount of nitrogen capable of being fixed by the Hiiusser process as hitherto operated must be less than the above values.Considering next the exhaust stage of the explosion, the amount of the combined nitrogen in the burnt gases will suffer a diminution on account of the in-nuence of dissociation. In this respect, however, the Hiiusser process is claimed to present advantages as compared with the arc process by reason of the facility witli which the gases can be rapidly cooled. By accelerating the exhaust, the gases undergo a great reduction in pressure, and consequently in temperature, so that dissociation of the nitric oxide is reduced to a minimum.Another factor, perhaps of only minor import-ance, tends to increase the concentration of oxides of nitrogen in the cooled gases, this factor being the contraction in volume of the burnt gases due to the condensation of water vapour. For a given volume of combustible gas, the partial pressure of the water vapour diminishes as the proportion of oxygen and nitrogen in the burnt gases increases, so that the relative contraction diminishes as the initial explosive mixture is progressively diluted with more air. In the case of enriched mixtures, however, the contrac-tion is relatively greater, and does not diminish as rapidly with progressive dilution as in the case of air-gas mixtures. The value of the contraction . factor in raising the concentration will therefore depend upon the particular conditions of operation, and also upon the extent to which the oxides of nitrogen are absorbed by the condensed moisture.A consideration of the nett effect of the explosion and exhaust stages of the Hausser process as hitherto operated leads to the conclusion that the percentage of combined nitrogen available in the cooled exhaust gases for recovery in the absorption towers will be substantially lower than that normally available in the case of the arc process. This view, based upon the theoretical aspects of the process, receives confirmation from the evidence given below as to the concentration of nitric oxide obtainable in actual practice.PEACTICAL INVESTIGATIONS.A trial installation at Nuremberg, comprising a bomb having a capacity of 100 litres (3-53 cu. ft.), served for carrying out a large number of experiments upon the various aspects of the process, and was ap-apparently in opeiation for about two years As the outcome of these investigations, a trial factory, stated to have cost  10,000, was erected in 1913 at Heeringen, adjacent to a coke-oven installation, from which the necessary gas, electric power&quot;, and water were obtained.The plant at Heeringen comprised separate gas-holders, into which the coke-oven gas, air and oxygen were compressed, and two water-cooled bombs, each having a capacity of 100 litres (3- 53 cu. ft.). Each bomb was provided with a set of mechanically operated valves for admitting the separate ingredients of the explosive mixture and scavenging air, and another valve for exhausting the products of combustion. The gases were introduced at a pressure of about 85, lb. per sq. in., and after ignition by means of an electric spark the pressure rose to about 500 lb. per sq. in. The bombs were worked at a speed of 50 explosions per minute, and it was expected that a modification of the valve gear would enable a speed of 75 explosions per minute to be attained.The exhaust gases, after leaving the bomb, passed through a multitubular boiler, the flue of which contained a series of coils in which the compressedair passing from the gas holder to the bomb was pre-heated to a temperature of about 300o C, In passing through the boiler the exhaust gases were cooled from about 700o C. or 800o C. to about 200o C, but according to a report based upon an inspection of the^ plant which was made in August 1913, no steps had been taken at that date to utilise the steam raised in the boiler or to measure the quantity of steam obtainable. The cooled gases from the boiler were led through aluminium cooling coils, in which the moisture contained in the products of combustion was; condensed. The. recovery of the combined nitrogen in the gases was then effected in the usual way by means -of oxidation and absorption towers, the column of air in the boiler and oxidation tower serving a secondary-purpose in absorbing the shocks from the exhaust. The solution obtained in the first absorption tower contained, about 30 per cent, of nitric acid.The main difficulty experienced in the operation of the plant was the regulation of the valves in such a manner as to&apos; get the desired mixture of the various gases in the bomb. This difficulty, which apparently had not been overcome in 1913, gave rise to faulty explosive mixtures and misfires, resulting in a waste of the different gases, in danger of explosions in the parts of the apparatus succeeding the bomb, and in a greater dilution of the nitric oxide in the exhaust gases, the latter factor rendering subsequent recovery operations more difficult. At temperatures above 200o C., oxides of nitrogen are without corrosive action on iron, and it was thus possible to employ iron or steel in the construction of the bomb and cooling boiler. From ,: this point onwards, however, the apparatus had to be constructed of aluminium, glazed stoneware, or glass. &apos;With regard to the power requirements of the above plant, it appears that an electric motor of 140 h.p. was used for the Linde oxygen plant, a motor of 220 h.p. for driving the three single-cylinder com-pressors used for the gaseous ingredients of the explosive mixture, and a small motor of several horse-power for operating the valve gear.EVIDENCE ON YIELD OF HN03,The evidence available deals with the. results of experiments earned out with town lighting; gas and coke-oven gas in stationary bombs, and in some cases is not very definite with regard to the conditions of operation, being more in the nature of a summary of results that have been achieved. Moreover, it seems that the yield of acid was determined from-the con-centration of nitric oxide in the exhaust gases, and none of the evidence specifically mentions the actual recovery in absorption tower apparatus of the quantities of nitric acid mentioned.According to a statement by Hausser, a &apos;con-centration of from 1- 3 per cent, to 117 per cent, of nitric oxide was obtained by exploding a mixture of air and 10 to 11 per cent, of lighting gas in a bomb of 100 litres capacity. The initial pressure was about three atmospheres and the explosion pressure about 22 atmospheres, the temperature of the explosion attaining a figure of l,600o to l,700o absolute. The calculated equilibrium concentration for this tempera-ture amounts to about 0&quot;1 per cent, of nitric oxide and the increased concentration mentioned above was secured by maintaining the explosion pressure at its maximum value, which was attained in about 0-09 seconds, for a further period of 0*07 seconds.It should be noted that the formation of nitric oxide is not accompanied by any diminution in the molecular volume of the gaseous mixture. In con-sequence, a result of the above character in the case of a purely thermal process would appear to be contrary to the law of mass-action.Investigations at Nuremberg.An account was published by Prof. C. Matignon in 1914 (Chemical Trade Journal, January 17th, 1914) of the results obtained during some experiments carried out in his presence at Nuremberg with a bomb of 100 litres capacity. In one set of experiments the initial composition of the explosive mixture was in the pro-portion of 38 volumes of lighting gas to 340 volumes
of air, and tho mean concentration of nitric oxide in the exhaust gases was equivalent to 9 &apos;8 gms. of HN03 per cu. m. This figures corresponds to about 0135 per cent, by volume of nitric oxide. In another set of experiments, &apos; oxygen was added to the explosive mixture, the ingredients being in the proportion of 40 volumes of lighting gas, 128 volumes of air, and 13 volumes of oxygen. When using this mixture the initial pressure amounted to 3 kg. per sq. cm. (about 3 atmospheres) and the explosion pressure to 22- 5 kg. per sq. cm. The duration of the period of increase of pressure was   sec, the duration of the compression itself being I- sec. In these experiments the mean concentration of nitric oxide per cu. m. of exhaust gas was equivalent to 15&apos;5 gms. of HNO;i, corresponding to about 0155 per cent, by volume of nitric oxide. The above figures are apparently exclusive of the small quantities of nitric acid present in the water of combustion condensed in the aluminium cooling coils.Information derived from another source deals with the general results of experiments carried out apparently at Nuremberg, with illuminating gas having a calorific value (nett) of 4,300 kg. cal. per cu. m. (483 B.Th.U. per cu. ft.). According to the first set of experiments, which were made with a mixture of illuminating gas and air in unspecified proportions at an initial pressure of 3 atmospheres and without preheating, the yield obtained amounted to 9 to 10 gms. of nitric acid per&apos; cu. m. of exhaust gas, or 80 gms. per cu. m. of illuminating gas. According to these figures, the concentration of nitric oxide in the exhaust gases varied from 0&apos; 32 to 0&apos; 35 per cent, by volume,Similar experiments were carried out at an initial pressure of 4 atmospheres with the combustion air pire-heated to from 250o to 300o 0., with accelerated exhaust, and \with  improved scavenging of the bomb. These modifications in the conditions increased the yield to 11 or 12 gms. of HN03 per cu. m. of exhaust gas, or 125 gms. per cu. m. of illuminating gas, indi-cating a concentration of 0 * 39 to 0&apos;42 percent, by volume of nitric oxide in the exhaust gases.Comparative experiments, with and without the addition of oxygen to the explosive mixture, were then made under similar conditions as regards the mean compression and retarded exhaust, the initial com-pression amounting to about 3 atmospheres. The combustion air was not pre-heated in these experiments as it was considered that the apparatus would not have withstood the higher strain in the case of the enriched explosive mixture. Without the use of oxygen, the yield varied from 9 to 10 gms. of HNO:i per cu. m. of exhaust gas as before. The addition, however, of 0&apos;33 cu. m, of oxygen (98 per cent, purity) per cu, m. of illuminating gas increased the yield to 17 or 18 gms. of HNO3 per cu. m. of exhaust gas, or 130 gms. per cu. m of illuminating gas. The nitric oxide obtained in the exhaust gases in the course of the last experi-ments is stated to have amounted to 0-7 per cent, as compared with about 1&quot;2 per cent, in the case of the arc process. The yields actually quoted, however, correspond to a concentration of 0-6 to 0&quot;64 per cent, by volume of nitric oxide.According to the evidence, two samples of the exhaust gas were taken in every case, and gave results differing by about 3 per cent., and this is adduced in support of the uniformity of the reaction. It is stated that if the best figures obtained in the course of the two sets of experiments with and without oxygen are combined, the yield with an initial compression of 4 atmospheres would amount to 200 gms. of HN03 per cu. m. of illuminating gas with one-third of a cu. m. of additional oxygen, and that the exhaust gases would contain about 26 gms. of HN03 per cu. m., representing a concentration of 1 per cent, of nitric oxide. It wa3 considered that an actual yield of 190 gms. might be expected, allowing for a loss of 10 gms. during con-densation. There is no indication, however, that figures of this order were actually confirmed by experiments combining the features of a high initial compression, the pre-heating of the combustion air, and the addition of oxygen to the explosive mixture. As in the case of the evidence previously given, the above figures apparently take no account of the nitric acid contained in the condensed moisture of combus-tion, namely, about 2 to 3 gms. of HN03 per litre.Reference is also made to tho utilisation of American natural gas and of crude oil in a fine state of division as the combustible elements of. the explo-sive mixture. On the basis of the experiments made with illuminating gas, it was estimated that American natural gas having a calorific value of 8,000 kg. -cals. per cu. m. (900B.Th,U. per cu, ft.) would yield 350 gms. of HNO3 per cu. m. when enriched by the addition of 0&apos;6 cu. m. of oxygen per cu. m. of gas. In the case of crude oil it was estimated that an actual yield of 530 to&apos; 580 gms. of HNO3 would be obtained per kg. of crude oil by the addition of 0&apos; 7 to 018 cu. m. of oxygen per kg. of oil.Investigations at Heeringen.The Hausser process was investigated on behalf of a company in 1914 with a view to the purchase of the patent rights for certain European countries. The purchase was to be subject to definite guarantees as to the yield of nitric acid per cu. m. of com-bustible gas, and this yield was to be established by actual trial runs. Owing to the absorption apparatus at the factory being dismantled for reconstruction, complete trial runs do not appear to have been made. A number of tests, however, were carried out on the exhaust gases, and these seem to have satisfied the experts that the guaranteed yield would be obtained. The results of the tests are summarised below.The coke-oven gas employed had a calorific value of 3,900 kg. cals. per cu. m. (438 B.Th.TJ. per cu. ft), and each charge of explosive mixture contained 35 litres (1&apos;23 cu. ft.) of the gas measured at 0o C. and 760 mm. pressure. The initial pressure in the bomb throughout the tests was 3&apos; 2 atmospheres, and the combustion air was pre-heated to 240o 0. In the absence of any specific reference to the addition of oxygen, it is to be presumed that the explosive mixture consisted of coke-oven gas and air alone. The amount of scavenging air introduced after each explosion was 100 litres (the capacity of the bomb) and the air was at a temperature of 80o 0.The average yield measured by the combined nitrogen in the exhaust gases was found to be 15&apos; 85 gms. of HNO3 per cu. m.-, thus indicating a concentra-tion of about 0- 56 per cent, by volume of nitric oxide. The volume of the exhaust gases, after allowing for the theoretical contraction, amounted to 7&apos;8 cu. m. (27516 cu. ft.) per cu. m. of combustible gas employed, so that the total yield of nitric acid was 12316 gms. per cu. in. of coke-oven gas measured at normal temperature and pressure. On the basis of a com-bustible gas having a calorific value of 4,300 kg. cals. per cu. m. (483 B.Th.TJ. per cu. ft.), the yield under similar conditions of operation would have been 136&apos;2 gms. of HNO3.An examination of the condensed moisture in the aluminium cooling tubes revealed the presence of 1 gm. of HNO3 per litre of condensate. As the coni-combustion of 1 cu. m. of coke-oven gas was found to result in the production of 0&apos;7 litres of water, the loss of combined nitrogen due to condensation only amounted to 0-7 gms. of HN03 per cu. in. of coke-oven gas utilised. No allowance for this loss is included in the figures previously given.The purchase contract was based upon the em-ployment of coke-oven gas having a calorific value of 4,300 kg. cals. per cu. m., and of initial pressures of 5-5 to 6 atmospheres, and the guaranteed yield per cu. m. of combustible gas was 150 gms. of HN03 with a margin of plus or minus 10 per cent. The experts were satisfied that the yield in the experiments carried out at a lower initial pressure, namely, 3-2 atmo-spheres, showed a margin of 1 2 gms. of HN03 over the minimum yield guaranteed, namely, 135 gms. ^ In considering these figures from the point of view of the losses of combined nitrogen in the con-densation and absorption stages^ and during the concentration of the weak tower acid, the experts deal with the question of the increase in the yield conse* quent upon the use of higher initial pressures. According to the law of increase established experi-ment&amp;lly at Nuremberg, the yield in the above trials if carried out at increased initial pressures, and with
coko-oven gas of 4,300 kg, cals. per cu. m., would have been as follows: Initial Compressionof Explosive Mixture. (Atmospheres.)Yield per cu. m. of Coke-oven Gas, (Gms. UNO,.,.)4-0 4-6 5-0 5-5 6-0157 170 180 190 200As there appeared to be no doubt concerning the correctness of the experimental law, the experts con-sidered that the losses of combined nitrogen were altogether unlikely to reduce the ultimate yield belowthe minimum figure guaranteed when operating at an initial pressure of 5 atmospheres, especially in view of existing experience in similar recovery operations. They concluded, therefore, that it was extremely probable that the results of final tests would confirm the validity of the guarantees specified in the contract. In consequence, however, of the outbreak of war, the contract was not carried through to completion.Summary of Evidence.The following table summarises the evidence given above regarding the yield of nitric acid and the corresponding concentration of nitric oxide in the exhaust gases: YIELD OF NITRIC ACID.Summary of Experimental Evidence.Combustible Gas and Calorific Value per cu. m.

The addi-tion of scavenging air for clearing the bomb of the products of explosion may, however, have resulted in further combustion during the exhaust stage.The figures also indicate a marked improvement in the concentration of nitric oxide when the explosive mixture was enriched with oxygen, but even in these cases the exhaust gases were very dilute, containing only about one-half the percentage of nitric oxide ordinarily present in arc furnace gases.   (Section III.)Recovery Operations.In order to assist in the formation of tentative conclusions from the above evidence it is necessary to consider the extent to which the very small percentage of combined nitrogen in the exhaust gases can be recovered under commercial conditions-The reactions involved in the recovery operations have already been discussed in dealing with the arc process (Section III.), which normally yields gases containing about 1-25 per cent, by volume of. nitric oxide, and special mention was made of the large dimensions of the absorption system reqriired.In the case of the Hausser process, the much lower concentration of nitric oxide coupled with the relatively small percentage of free oxygen in the burnt products adds materially to the difficulties of recovery. The time required for the conversion of nitric oxideinto nitrogen peroxide during the various stages ot the reactions is substantially increased, the rate of absorption of the peroxide by water is diminished, and the evaporation of the nitric acid in the towers is augmented by the increased percentage of inert gases present. On account of these factors, the dimensions of the absorption system must be largely increased to ensure efficient recovery, while the limiting concentra-tion of nitric acid attainable at ordinary temperatures will be lower than in the case of the arc process. In the latter connection it appears that the solution obtained in the first absorption tower of the Hausser plant at Heeringen contained about 30 per cent, of nitric acid.The practical aspects of the recovery problem when dealing with gases containing a low concentration of nitric oxide have already been indicated in the case of the Pauling arc process (Section III.), and details were given of the dimensions of the absorption plant used for gases containing a much smaller percentage of nitric oxide than usual, namely, 0 - 8 per cent, by volume.The losses specified in connection with the plant there under review were of the order of 1 per cent, and must be regarded as exceptionally low. Accord-ing to reliable evidence, the overall losses when dealing with arc furnace gases containing about 1 - 25 per cent, by volume of nitric oxide may amount to about 9 - 4 per cent, of the total fixed nitrogen in the gases. Unless, therefore, the Hausser process is operated in connection with a well-designed absorption plant of the excessive dimensions necessitated by the dilute gases, it seems probable that the overall losses are likely to amount to at least 10 per cent.
APPENDIX V. :  HAUSSKR PROCESS. .., 281-.The only information upon this point is of an indirect character, and has been deduced from an estimate for a Hausser installation prepared by one of the experts previously referred to. The estimate is based upon an output of 5,000 metric tons of pure HN03 per year of 8,500 hours from a plant capable of utilising 4,000 cu. m. of coke-oven gas per hour, the yield of HNO:t per cu. m. of coke-oven gas being taken at 186 gms.According to the latter figure the annual output would amount to 6,320 metric tons of HNO:1 (calculated as 100 per cent.), so that the estimate appears to allow for an overall loss of about 20 per cent, of the nitrogen fixed.Observations and Conclusions.The evidence obtained as the result of the trials , carried out under expert direction just prior to the war establishes the fact that the Hausser process, when utilising coke-oven gas of. 3,900 kg. cals. per gu. m. under specific conditions in bombs of the type installed at Heeringen, is capable of producing exhaust gases containing the equivalent of 123 - 6 gms. of HNOn per cu. m. of coke-oven gas employed.The experiments, however, can hardly be regarded as having fully demonstrated the possibilities of the process, for two important reasons. In the first place, the fact that the absorption plant, which appears to have been of quite an ordinary type, was dismantled, did not permit of any comparison being made between the yield measured on the exhaust gases and the marketable products recoverable. In the second place, the trials were carried out with coke-oven gas of a lower calorific value and at lower initial pressures than the stipulated values. Granting the validity of the Nuremberg experiments upon the relation between the ,yield and initial pressure, there is no definite evidence that the bombs installed at Heeringen were capable of working either intermittently or con-tinuously under the much more severe conditions specified in the contract. In this connection it may be noted that the bombs were of the same type as those which were used at the Nuremberg plant, and reference has already been made to conditions under which it was considered unsafe to operate the bombs at the latter place.Given a bomb or explosion engine capable of operating continuously under the conditions specified, it seems probable that the yield of combined nitrogen measured on the exhaust gases might attain values of the order of 150 gms. of HNO;), or even more per cu. m. of coke-oven gas employed. In order, how-ever, to obtain such yields it might be necessary to rsly upon explosive mixtures diluted beyond the optimum value, the lower concentration of nitric oxide in such cases being more than counterbalanced by the increased volume of the products of combustion per cu. m. of coke-oven gas consumed. Thus, the higher yield does not necessarily represent a higher con-centration of nitric oxide in the exhaust, and, from a commercial standpoint, the concentration is the governing factor as long as reliance has to be placed upon standard methods of recovery. The necessity for installing costly absorption plant of the very large dimensions previously indicated would seriously detract from the apparent simplicity of the process, and would render its application of very limited scope. From an economic point of view the prospects would be improved if absorption plant of moderate dimensions could be utilised. Under such conditions, however, there are certain to be substantial losses of combined nitrogen, and the extent of&quot; these losses still remains to be established.A marked improvement in the concentration of nitric oxide and in the yield of nitric acid should be obtained by the addition of oxygen to the explosive mixture. The experimental evidence available, how-ever, is not sufficient to indicate the probable order of the benefits obtainable under commercial conditions. Moreover, the extent to which oxygen could be pro-fitably employed involves economic considerations, as is shown later.In order to provide a working basis for dealing with other aspects of the process, the Sub-Committee has provisionally adopted the minimum figure for yieldstipulated in the purchase contract, namely, 135 gms. of HNO;i per cu. m, of coke-oven gas of an average character having a calorific value (nett) of, say, 450 B.Th.U. per cu. ft. (4,004 kg, cals. per cu. m.) when operating at initial pressures of the order of 5 to 6 atmospheres with the combustion air preheated to a temperature of the order of 250o C.There is reason for believing that a yield of the above order. could be obtained under the conditions outlined even when allowance is made for a fairly substantial loss of combined nitrogen during the recovery operations.The production of a metric ton of HNO:j (calculated as 100 per cent.) would, upon the basis of the above figures, necessitate the utilisation of over 7,407 cu.&apos;m., or, approximately, 261,600 cu. ft. of coke-oven gas, representing a total calorific value of about 117 700,000 B.Th.U, or 29,660,000 kg. cals.POWER REQUIREMENTS.From a consideration of the general characteristics of the Hausser process as hitherto carried out, it is clear that the power requirements are mainly involved in the compression of the large volumes of gases employed. The operation of the valve gear of the ; bombs and the circulation of the solutions in the absorption towers represent requirements of a minor order.Some evidence, based upon the operation of the plants at Nuremberg and Heeringen, is available as to the power requirements and is summarised below.In order to eliminate uncertainty as to the validity of the figures for the yield of nitric acid, it is con-venient to express the total power requirements in terms of the consumption of combustible gas per unit of time. It is then possible to apply any desired figure for yield (eg., the figure provisionally adopted by the Sub-Committee) and thus express the power requirements in terms of the output of nitric acid or combined nitrogen.The first set of figures under review relates to a plant requiring 50,000 cu. m. of coke-oven gas, 260,000 cu. m. of combustion air, and 16,000 cu. m. of enriching oxygen per day of 24 hours, corresponding to 13,583 cu. m. of explosive mixture per hour. The power requirements for compressing the ingredients of the mixture to a pressure of four atmospheres are given as 0&apos;063 k.w.-hour per cu. m., the hourly re-quirements thus amounting to about 856 k.w.-hours. The compression of the scavenging air accounts for an. additional 60 k.w.-hours, thus bringing the hourly re-quirements to 916 k.w.-hours. The estimate also specifies the power requirements of the liquid air plant for making the necessary oxygen, but this figure has been omitted. The total requirements expressed in terms of the capacity of the plant for utilising coke-oven gas thus amount to about 440 k.w.-hours per 1,000 cu. m. (or 12-45 k.w.-hours per 1,000 cu. ft.) per hour.The provisional figure for yield adopted by the Sub-Committee corresponds to the utilisation of 7,407 cu. m. of coke-oven gas for every metric ton&apos; of nitric acid (calculated as 100 per cent.) produced. The power requirements per metric ton of nitric acid per hour would thus amount to about 3,259 k.w.-hours, or 0 - 388 k.w.-year of 8,400 hours, the equivalent value per metric ton of nitrogen fixed being 1 - 75 k.w.-years of 8,400 hours.No allowance appears to be made in the estimate for the utilisation of the waste heat of the exhaust gases.The second set of figures under review relates to a plant requiring 4,000 cu. m. of coke-oven gas and 24,000 cu. m. of combustion air per hour. The power requirements per hour for compression to about 6 atmospheres are placed at 2,400 h.p.-hours, or 1,790 k.w.-hours, corresponding to 0-06 k.w.-hour per *cu. m. of explosive mixture, while the other require-ments of the plant amount to 240 h.p.-hours, or 179&apos; k.w.-hours. The total requirements per hour expressed in terms of the quantity of coke-oven gas utilised thus amount to 492 k.w.-hours per 1,000 cu. m, On the basis of the figui-e for yield adopted by the Sub-Committee, the power requirements per metric ton of HNO3 (calculated as 100 per cent.) produced would
therefore be 3,644 k.w.-hours, or 0&apos;434 lc.w.-year of 8,400 hours, the equivalent value per metric ton of nitrogen fixed being 1/95 k.w,-year of 8,400 hours. It was estimated, however, that the steam raised by means of the hot exhaust gases would be sufficient to provide 1,200 h.p.-hours, or over 45 per cent, of tho total requirements, leaving 1,440 h.p.-hours or 1,074 k.w.-hours to be provided externally, for example, .by means of gas-engine plant using the coke-oven gas. According to these figures, the nett requirements, expressed in terms of the capacity of the plant for utilising coke-oven gas, would be 268&apos;5 k.w.-hours per 1,000 cu, m. (or 7&apos;6 k.w.-hours per 1,000 cu. ft.) per hour. On this basis the nett requirements per metric ton of nitric acid (calculated as 100 per cent.) would thus amount to 1,989 k.w,-hours, or 0-236 k.w.-year of 8,400 hours, the equivalent value per metric ton of nitrogen fixed being 1&apos; 06 k.w.-year of 8,400 hours.Observations and Conclusions.The two estimates, although derived from separate sources, are in substantial agreement upon a number of points, as indicated in the above figures. Moreover, when allowance is made for the amount of scavenging air utilised in accordance with the first estimate, the two sets of figures show approximately the same ratio between the volume of the coke-oven gas and the total volume of gases compressed, namely, 1: 7.Taking the Sub-Oommittee&apos;s provisional figure for the yield of nitric acid, it appears, therefore, that the gross power requirements of the Hausser process, when operated with bombs of the type in use at Heeringen, will be of the order of 1&apos; 75 to 1 - 95 k.w.-years of 8,400 hours per metric ton of nitrogen fixed.The nett requirements are governed by the steam-raising value of the exhaust gases, and this will depend upon the conditions under which the explosion is effected and upon the conditions of exhaust. It is possible to estimate the approximate value of the waste heat for any specific conditions, and the figure put forward above by the experts may be taken as indicating the possible saving in the gross power requirements under particular conditions of operation. Assuming a saving of, say, 45 per cent., the nett power requirements of the process as hitherto operated would, upon the basis of the yield provisionally adopted, appear to be of the order of 1 k.w.-year of 8,400 hours per metric ton of nitrogen fixed, thus showing a very substantial economy as compared with the arc pro-cess, which requires 8&apos;41 k.w.-years of 8,760 hours (Section III).The position would be quite different, however, if the process were carried out by means of an explosion engine, and the possibilities in this direction are dis-cussed later.ECONOMICS OF THE PROCESS.Two detailed estimates for full-scale Hausser installations based upon the working results obtained at the plants at Nuremberg and Heeringen have been available to the Sub-Committee.In each case a definite yield of nitric acid is assumed to be obtainable under specified conditions of working, and the figures thus taken govern not only the capacity and capital cost of the installation, but also the operating costs. The estimates are dealt with in some detail below, and modified figures are also given in order to indicate the approximate capital and operating costs on the basis of the yield provisionally adopted by the Sub-Committee, namely, 135 gms. of HN03 per cu. m. of coke-oven gas of average character (450 B.Th.U. per cu. ft.) without the addition of oxygen to the explosive mixture.First Estimate. vThe installation in the first estimate is intended to deal with 50,000 cu., m. of coke-oven gas (4,300 kg. cals.) per day, the combustion mixture being enriched with oxygen, and used at an initial pressure of 4 atmospheres. The yield is taken at 190 gms. of HNO;t per cu. m. of combustible gas, corresponding to an output of 3,325 metric tons of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) per year of 50 weeks, or 3,500 metric tons of 94 per cent, nitric acid. Taking the figure for yield adopted by the Sub-Committee, tie annual output would amount to 2,362 metric tons of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.), or say, 2,500 metric tons of 94 per cent, acid.The plant is provided with a lime nitrate section, and the power requirements are met from an external supply.Capital Cost.   The capital cost is quoted as follows: Concentrated Acid (91 percent) per metric ton per annum.

The price of the coke-oven gas is based upon its calorific value as compared with that of coal of 7,500 kg. cals. at. 11s. per ton. It is assumed that the employment of the gas for the Hausser installation might necessitate the use of coal-firing in other parts of the plant, and after making allowance for this factor the price of the gas is taken at 7s. 6d. per 1,000 cu. m., or 2-55d per 1,000 cu. ft.The cost of energy in the case of gas-engine power plant running continuously at a uniform load of 90 to 100 per cent, is taken at 0-216$. per k.w.-hour, inclusive of attendance, depreciation, and interest.The cost of concentrating the dilute nitric acid (30 to 40 per cent.) to a strength of 94 per cent, is taken at  2*5 per metric ton of 94 per cent, acid, inclusive of attendance, depreciation of the concen-trating plant, and interest.Upon the basis of the above figures, the following operating costs are quoted for a working year of 350 days, the yield of HNO:t (calculated as 100 per cent.) being taken at 190 gms. per cu. m. of coke-oven gas: ConcentratedAnnualCosts.Coke-oven gas:  50,000cu. m.   per day  at.s-. fi(Z. per 1,000 cu. m.(2-55d.    per    1.000cu. ft.) - - - 0,550 Oxygen (98 per  cent.purity) : 10,000 cu. m.per day at  1-4 per1,000 cu.  m.

The stallation is intended to deal with 4,000 cu. m. of coke-oven gas (4,300 kg. cals.)per hour, the combustion mixture consisting of coke-oven gas and air alone, and being used at an initial pressure of 6 kg. per sq. cm. (85-3 lb. per sq. in.). The yield is taken at 186 gms. of HN03 per cu. m. of coke-oven gas, and the output of the plant per year of 8,500 hours should, on this basis, amount to 6,320 metric tons of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.).  The output actually reckoned uponis 5,000 metric tons of HN03 (calculated as 100 percent.), so that the figures appear to allow for an overallloss of about 20 per cent, during the recovery andconcentrating operations.The power requirements of this installation havebeen referred to under a previous heading (pp. 281-82).

It is interesting for purposes of record to quote the details given in the above estimate for the cost of manufacturing oxygen by the Claude liquid air process. The plant is assumed to be in operation for 7,200 hours per annum, and the pur-chase price of the electrical energy is somewhat higher than that for the Hausser plant, presumably on account of the lower load factor.The operating costs for oxygen of 80 to 90 per cent, purity are given as follows : Per 1,000 cu. m.  Per 1,000 cu. ft.For a yield of 135 gms. of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) per cu. m. of coke-oven gas after allow-ing for all losses during absorption and concentration, the output per year of 8,500 hours would amount to 4,590 metric tons, corresponding to a capital cost of  18 - 3 per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) per annum.Operating Costs. The price of the coke-oven gas is taken at 9-6s. per 1,000 cu. m.

Taking the lower yield of 135 gms. of HrT03 (cal-oulatod as 100 per cent.) per cu. m. of coke-oven gas, corresponding to an annual output of 4,590 metric tons of acid, tho operating costs would be equivalent to  12-2 per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent&apos;.).Observations and Conclusions.In comparing the estimates for capital cost, account must be taken of the fact that one installation includes oxygen plant and relies upon an external supply of electricity, whereas the other comprises the necessary motive-power plant, but does not include oxygen plant. Allowing for these differences, the estimates are in substantial agreement.Special reference, however, must be made to the items dealing with the capital cost of the absorption and acid concentrating plant. According to authori-tative evidence available to the Sub-Committee in respect of a small-scale arc process installation having a maximum output of combined nitrogen equivalent to nearly 6,000 metric tons of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) per annum, the capital cost of the absorption towers and accessories amounts to  9 - 26, and of the acid concentrating plant to  4 - 5 per metric ton of HNO3 (calculated as 100 per cent.) per annum. These figures are based upon conditions prevailing in Norway before the war, and are exclusive of the cost of buildings, miscellaneous equipment, work-shops and of any charges in connection with the preparation of the site. When regard is had to the dilute character of the nitric acid obtainable by the Hausser process, the items in the estimates can hardly be taken as adequate even if an allowance is made for the use of stoneware towers in place of granite towers.From the evidence available it appears that when using the stationary type of bomb, the capital cost of an installation for producing concentrated nitric acid on a moderate scale might be of the order of  20 per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 percent.) per annum apart from accessories such as oxygen plant and motive-power plant. This figure may be compared with the cost of the chemical sections of a large-scale arc furnace installation for producing concentrated nitric acid, namely,  20-5 per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) per annum. (Section III.)Considering next the principal items involved in the operating costs, the charge allowed for the con-centration of nitric acid is in accordance with other evidence, and the figures taken for the cost of coke-oven gas could doubtless be realised at certain plants in this country. The cost of the electrical energy, however, in the case of a demand of comparatively small magnitude, would probably be higher than that indicated.Allowing for this factor and for an increased charge for depreciation, it would still appear that the Hausser process is capable of manufacturing concentrated nitric acid at a cost substantially lower than that incurred under pre-war conditions in connection with the retort process, via Chile nitrate, namely,  22 - 3 per metric ton (calculated at 100 per cent.). (Section I.) On the other hand, the cost, of the acid would probably be higher than that obtainable by an arc furnace instal-lation operated in connection with a large-scale steam turbo-electric power plant.   (Section III.)The figure for yield provisionally adopted by the Sub-Committee represents the utilisation of about 261,600 cu. ft. of coke-oven gas per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) recovered, and an increase or reduction in the cost of the gas by one penny per 1,000 cu. ft. would thus affect the produc-tion costs to the extent of  1 - 09 per metric ton of HN03. Even in the case of a substantially higher &apos; yield of acid than that taken, it is clear that Hausser process is only likely to find an application in cases where cheap power-gas of high calbrific value is available, as at coke-ovens. The employment of illuminating gas costing, say, 2s. per 1,000 cu. ft. would obviously be out of the question from an economic point of view.With regard to the addition of oxygen to the explosive mixture, the first estimate shows that the cost incurred is substantial if pure oxygen has to be manufactured specially for the purpose, and might debar the use of oxygen in sufficient quantities to obtain the maximum benefit. It is possible, however, that this drawback might be avoided if waste gases rich in oxygon, such as are obtained during the separation of nitrogen from the^ air by liquefaction, could be utilised for the process.APPLICATION OP PROCESS AT COKE-OVENS.Apart from developments involving the employment of crude oil or other liquid combustibles, the preceding observations point to the fact that the Hausser process is likely to find its main application as an adjunct to coke-oven plants where surplus gas is available. It is possible that the successful development of the process might lead to the withdrawal of a certain amount of coke-oven gas from uses to which it is at present put. In this event tho cost of the gas to the process would be represented by the equivalent cost of the coal or other fuel needed in the industry from which the gas was withdrawn.A brief examination maybe made of certain aspects of the process in relation to coke-oven plant.Relation between Output of Nitric Acid and Capacity of Coke-oven Plant.In modern types of regenerative coke-ovens about 40 to 50 per cent, of the gas generated has to be utilised for heating the oven flues. When allowance is also made for the heat and power requirements of the plant, which will vary somewhat according to the system of ammonia recovery adopted, it may be taken that, on an average, about 40 per cent, of the total amount of gas generated will be available for external use.A ton of good coking coal having a calorific value of, say, 13,000 B.TI1.U. per lb. when coked in an aver-age oven, will yield about 0 - 72 ton of coke and about 11,500 cu. ft. of gas having a calorific value (nett) of about 450 B.Th.TJ. per cu. ft. Of this quantity, there-fore, some 4,600 cu. ft. of surplus gas will be available for the Hausser process after the total requirements of the coke-oven plant have been met.According to the figure for yield provisionally adopted by the Sub-Committee, namely, 135 gms. of HN03 per cu. m. (35-31 cu. ft.) of coke-oven gas, about 261,600 cu. ft. of gas must be utilised to produce a metric ton of HNO:1 (calculated as 100 per cent.). This amount of surplus gas necessitates the coking of 2,6164-46=56 - 87 tons of coal.In the case of a battery of 50 modern by-product ovens, each having a capacity of 10 tons of damp coal and burning off in about 30 hours, the amount of coal carbonised per week would amount to, say, 2,750 tons. Taking the surplus gas at the figure given above, the output of nitric acid from a Hausser plant utilising the whole of the surplus would amount to 44 -53 metric tons per week, or 2,226 metric tons of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) per year of 50 weeks.Larger coke-oven plants, comprising batteries of 60 ovens, are in operation, and two such batteries are installed in some piaces. At many existing plants, however, the surplus gas is already made use of, and if this were diverted to a Hausser plant it would be necessary to substitute coal.Prior to the war, the amount of coal coked in recovery ovens in England amounted to about 16,000,000 tons per annum. Upon the basis of the figures in the above paragraphs, the surplus gas from this quantity of coal would be sufficient to produce about 281,300 metric tons of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.), equivalent to about 62,500 metric tons of combined nitrogen. Assuming that existing users of the surplus gas had to consume coal instead, the total quantity needed to replace the gas would amount to about 1,183,000 tons (calorific value, 12,500 B.Th.U. per lb.).Manufacture of Nitrates.In view of the availability of by-product ammonia at coke-oven plants, the Hausser process would appear to have some attractions as a method of manufacturing ammonium nitrate, especially in cases where indirect ammonia recovery is adopted.  An indication may
therefore bo given as to the relation between tho amount of nitric acid produced and tho amount of ammonia available for its neutralization,According to the average practice, tho yield of ammonium sulphate per ton of coal carbonised may bo placed at about 27 lb. Assuming that the ammonium sulphate contains 25 per cent, of NH;1, the yield corresponds to about 3 kg. of actual NH3l so that 3 x 50-87 = 170 kg. of NH:t would bo available per metric ton of HNO;) produced from the surplus coke-oven gas. Apart from losses of combined nitrogen, about 270 kg. of ammonia are required for neutralising a metric ton of HNO:) (calculated as 100 per cent.). Taking the provisional figure for the yield of nitric acid, it thus appears that sufficient by-product ammonia would be available upon the spot for neutralising about 63 per cent, of the output of nitric acid. Additional supplies of ammonia could probably be obtained from adjacent coke-ovens for neutralising the remaining acid, or the latter could be marketed as such or con-verted into lime nitrate at the Hausser installation.POSSIBILITIES OF THE HAUSSER PROCESS.In describing the trial installation at Heeringen, reference was made to a number of difficulties en-countered in the operation of the bombs. Additional troubles are also likely to arise in opening the exhaust valves against high internal pressures, and on account of the corrosive action of the escaping hot gases upon the exhaust valves. Another serious disadvantage of of the stationary type of bomb resides in the fact that the energy developed by the explosion is wasted as far as the performance of external work is concerned.It was originally contemplated employing an ex-plosion engine for carrying out the process, and, although Hausser appears to have confined his investi-gations to the use of stationary bombs, there is evidence to show that, prior to the war, other investi-gators in Germany were exploring the possibility of using gas engines, and that some measure of success had been achieved. Having regard, however, to the conditions of temperature and pressure necessary for rendering the process a commercial possibility, it seems doubtfid whether gas engines of ordinary type with reciprocating parts and dead-ceutre gearing could be relied upon to withstand the shocks and unusual stresses involved.The process when considered from the point of view of a method of power production giving nitric acid as a by-product presents some attractions, and it is probable that ultimate developments may take this direction. The success of such developments, however, will depend, among other factors, upon the devising of a form of explosion engine that is better adapted to the requirements of the process than an ordinary gas engine. An investigation of this aspect of the problem suggests that distinct possibilities attach to the employment of a, simple form of explosion motor with a free piston. Such a motor would not only accurately measure the&apos; gaseous mixture for each explosion, thus preserving uniformity in operation, but would compress its own explosive mixture, thusrendering external compressors unnecessary. Tho use of a free piston also avoids tho troubles due to dcad-centre gearing. It appears that an ongine of the above type, if used for a Hausser installation consuming, say, 4,000 cu, m. (141,240 cu, ft.) of coke-oven gas of average calorific value per hour, might be capable of generating some 4,000 continuous b.h.p. in addition to meeting all the requirements of the chemical plant.From the process point of view, other advantages would seem to attach to a free-piston engine since pre-ignition can be arranged for and higher com-combustion temperatures and a high-peak diagram thus obtained. Moreover, the rapid reversal of the move-nient of the piston, and the quick expansion of the gases while doing external work, tend to diminish the dissociation of the nitric oxide contained in the pro-ducts of combustion.The economic possibilities of the process, however are materially influenced by the physical and chemical limitations governing the amount of nitrogen capable of being fixed by an explosion method, and by the difficulties attending the recovery operations. Granting the possibility of devising a simple and inexpensive explosion apparatus on the lines indicated, there still appears to remain the necessity for using elaborate and costly absorption tower plant of the kind previously mentioned. In addition, the plant required for con-concentrating the primary product, or for converting it into solid nitrate salts, is of a more extensive character than that needed in other processes, owing to the low strength of the tower acid obtained.The operating costs will also be affected by the low concentration cf nitric oxide and the losses during recovery, as these factors will govern the capital charges and the relative price of the coke-oven gas per unit of nitrogen recovered. Moreover, with stationary bombs, the cost of compressing the gases for the explosive mixture will also depend upon the yield from a given volume of combustible gas.The prospects of the process would be improved if cheap oxygen, or waste gases rich in oxygen, were available for enriching the explosive mixture and for replacing the scavenging air required. By its use the initial concentration of nitric oxide in the combustion products would be increased, and the enrichment of the burnt gases would lead to a more rapid conversion of the nitric oxide into nitrogen peroxide, thus diminish -ing the difficulties of recovery and perhaps enabling the size of the necessary recovery plant to be reduced.Apart from the possible use of oil fuels, the Hausser process is clearly of limited application, owing to its dependence upon a supply of cheap power-gas of good calorific value. Given such a gas, the process, not-withstanding its handicaps, appears to be capable of producing nitric acid at a cost substantially lower than that of the acid obtained by the standard non-synthetic method. (Section I.) It is improbable, however, that the process will attain any extensive commercial development for the fixation of nitrogen as long as present methods of recovering oxides of nitrogen have to be relied upon.
SECTION X.CYANIDE PROCESSES FOR FIXING ATMOSPHERIC NITROGEN.Since the early part of the 19th century it has been known that when a mixture of alkali or alkaline earth and carbon is heated to a sufficient temperature iii an atmosphere containing free nitrogen, the latter combines with the carbon and metallic base to form a cyanide. It was also observed at an early date that cyanides were decomposed when heated in the presence of steam, the nitrogen being evolved in the form of ammonia.These two reactions have formed the basis of a very large number of investigations having as their object the development of commercial processes for the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen as cyanides and the production of ammonia therefrom, The various researches that have been carried out upon the problem have been fully described in technical pub-lications (e.g., Norton, Utilisation of Atmospheric Nitrogen, 1912, pp. 116-32; Lunge, Coal Tar and Ammonia, 1916, Part 3, pp. 1113-23; Robine and Lenglen, The Cyanide Industry, 1906; Bucher, Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, March 1917).In spite of many determined efforts, the establish-ment of the processes upon a sound commercial basis still remains to be effected. Having regard, however, to the renewed interest that has recently been taken in the problem, it has been considered desirable to deal with the history and general characteristics of the processes in greater detail than might otherwise have been necessary.Nature of Cyanide Reactions.* -The chief attempts to effect the synthesis of metallic cyanides from atmospheric nitrogen have involved the employment of alkali or alkaline earth salts, and it was shown in the course of early investi-gations that carbonates and hydroxides were equally suitable for the reaction. The nature of the metallic base, however, was found to have an important influence upon the facility with which the nitrogen Avas fixed, barium compounds being more active towards nitrogen than potassium compounds, and the latter again more active than those containing sodium.At a later date, a detailed study of the absorption of nitrogen by metallic carbides revealed other differ-ences in the behaviour of alkali and alkaline earth metals. It was found that the products consisted of mixtures of cyanide and cyanamide, the proportion of the former increasing with the temperature. In the case of alkali carbides, the product was mainly cyanide, but with barium carbide the proportion of cyanamide in the product was larger. When calcium carbide was used, practically the whole of the nitrogen fixed up to temperatures of about 11000 C. was in the form of cyanamide. This marked difference in the behaviour of barium and calcium bases and the subsequent dis-covery of the fertilising value of calcium cyanamide eventually resulted in the commercial development of the cyanamide process on a large scale.  (Section Y.)The chemical reactions involved in the formation of cyanides from metallic bases and free nitrogen are indicated in the examples given below.With Alkali Bases. The complete reaction for the formation of sodium cyanide from sodium carbonate, carbon, and nitrogen is given by the equation :Na2C03 -(- 4C -f N2 zr 2NaCN 4- 300 - 138,500 cals.The carbon monoxide evolved during the reaction represents a potential source of heat, and its complete combustion would yield 61,500 cals. in excess of those needed for the main endothermic reaction.   If, there-fore, the carbon monoxide could be utilised to the maximum advantage, the process as a whole might be regarded as exothermic.In the event of impure nitrogen being employed for the reaction, the crude cyanide may be contaminated with sodium c anate owing to the action of oxygen upon the cyanide when the latter is in a fused or plastic condition,   iWith Barium Salts as Bases. When baryta or barium carbonate is employed, metallic barium is liberated by the reducing action of the carbon and then combines with the excess of carbon to form a carbide. The absorption of nitrogen by the carbide results in the formation of cyanide and cyanamide, the latter reaction being accompanied by the liberation of free carbon. Under favourable conditions, however, the cyanamide combines with the liberated carbon to form barium cyanide. The reactions are represented by the following equations: BaO-f-C = Ba4-COBa4-2C = BaCoBaC+N,    BaCN,-f-0BaCN24-C ^ Ba(CN),If the crude barium cyanide is lixiviated and the solution treated with alkali carbonates for the manu-facture of potassium or sodium cyanide, the barium base of the original reaction mixture is regenerated.Ammonia from Cyanides.One of the attractions of cyanide fixation processes resides in the facility with which the combined nitrogen in the crude cyanide products can be obtained in the form of ammonia. The reactions involved are indicated in the examples given below.From Alkali Cyanides. The formation of ammonia when solid cyanides are treated with steam or when aqueous solutions are boiled under certain conditions has been variously attributed to the following reactions: NaCN4-2H20 = NH;i4-NaCOOH 2Na0N-f-4H2O = 2NH34-Na2CO34-C0-fH2There is some doubt, however, as to whether the precise conditions under which the above reactions occur have been completely investigated.If the crude cyanide is contaminated with cyanate, the latter is also decomposed according to the equation :-NaCN04-2H20 - NH;i-l-NaHC03The sodium salts obtained as by-products during the ammonia stage can be utilised for the preparation of a further quantity of reaction mixture for the cyanide stage.From Barium Cyanide.   The decomposition of barium cyanide with steam at a temperature of 300o to 5000 C. results in the evolution of ammonia and the reaction has been attributed to the equation:  Ba(CN)24-4H20 - 2NH:,4-Ba(OH)24-2COThe Sub-Committee has been informed on good authority that the yield of ammonia from the crude furnace product obtained in the barium process is in excess of that indicated by the above equation, the excess being attributed to the presence of other nitrogen compounds decomposable by steam. Accord-ing to the same authority, it is unnecessary to crush the product, the reaction proceeding naturally and being difficult to stop if the. material is heated to about 300o C. and simply treated with steam.
APPENDIX V. : CYANIDE PROCESSES.On the other hand it has been stated that when alkaline earth cyanides aro decomposed under the con-ditions mentioned above, the evolution of ammonia is not quantitative, being accompanied by the liberation of free nitrogen. It is claimed, however, that the yield is almost quantitative if the cyanides are heated with water in an autoclave at a temperature of about 1500 0., a formate being obtained as a by-product. (Lunge, previously quoted.) The reaction in this case is given by the equation :-Ba(CN)2 4- 4H20 = 2NHa -r Ba(COOH).,If the crude furnace product contains barium cyanamide, the latter will also yield ammonia according to the equation: BaCN2 -f- 3H20 s 2NH:1 4- BaOO;t.Reference must be made, however, to the possibility of the formation of complex nitrogen derivatives of cyanogen, which are difficult to decompose, although the presencejof caustic baryta in the furnace product may prevent subsidiary reactions of this character from occurring.   (Section VI.)In view of the evidence given above, it is not clear that the best conditions for the production of ammonia have been definitely established. As in the case of alkali cyanides, however, the barium salts obtained as by-products in the ammonia stage can be utilised again for the cyanide stage.Observations. The fact that the alkali or barium base of the cyanide reaction mixture is regenerated during the production of ammonia and thus rendered available for further use, foreshadows the possibility of devising a continuous process for fixing atmospheric nitrogen in the form of ammonia through the inter-intermediary of metallic cyanides. In this respect the cyanide processes, if successfully developed, may stand at an advantage as compared with the calcium oyana-mide process when the latter is applied to the produc-tion of ammonia. Although proposals have been made to utilise the waste lime sludge resulting from the conversion of cyanamide1 into ammonia as a raw material for the carbide melt (Section VI.), as far as is known this has not hitherto been practised commercially.Temperature of Reaction   and  Influence   of Catalysts.The temperatures involved in the fixation of nitro-gen as cyanides are on the high side, ranging from upwards of l,000o 0. when alkali bases are employed, to about l,200o 0. when barium salts are used. As the reactions are endothermic, the equilibrium will be displaced in favour of the formation of cyanide by a rise in temperature. The practical difficulties experienced in the commercial operation of cyanide processes on account of these elevated temperatures are referred to later.In the course of a research upon the manufacture of Prussian blue, it was found by Lewis Thompson, as long ago as 1839, that potassium cyanide could be obtained by the action of air upon a mixture of potash and carbon under suitable conditions, the presence of metallic iron in the reaction mixture facilitating the fixation of the atmospheric nitrogen at a comparatively low temperature, namely, at a full red heat. He also noted that a much higher temperature was necessary when iron was not employed. For his researches, Thompson was awarded the Isis Gold Medal of the Royal Society of Arts.Other investigators have stated that the reaction is facilitated by the addition of metals such as nickel or manganese, which are capable of combining readily with carbon. There is no evidence to show, however, that such metals have been employed in any of the commercial attempts to manufacture cyanides, although Margueritte and Sourdeval, who worked a barium process for the manufacture of ammonia for some years, mentioned that the reaction mixture could be made up with or without the addition of iron filings. (Lunge, previously quoted.)The influence of metallic iron upon the formation of cyanides from atmospheric nitrogen was observedindependently by Timber under rather interesting circumstances. (Beriehte, 1899, 35, p. 8150). It had been recommended by an earlier investigator that iron powder should be mixed with organic compounds when testing for nitrogen in the well-known way by heating with metallic potassium. Timber found that this method of testing led to grass errors, and observed that &quot;powdered iron at the temperature of reaction &quot; possesses so strong an influence upon the fixation of &quot; nitrogen that, under the conditions recommended, &quot; very appreciable quantities of potassium cyanide &quot; may be produced even when the substance examined &quot; is quite free from nitrogen.&quot; He therefore carried out experiments with the object of devising a technical method of preparing alkali cyanides by the action of atmospheric nitrogen upon alkali carbonates or hydrox-ides. The research gave positive results which were &quot;in part so satisfactory&quot; that he considered the applicability of the method on a large scale to be &quot; not only possible but even probable.&quot; After making a search through literature, however, Timber found that the same process had been patented by Adler as early as 1880, and that after efforts extending over six years these patents had been allowed to lapse. From this ho concluded that there were great technical difficulties to be overcome. Nevertheless, as the result of his own researches, he considered that it was possible to hn-prove the method so as to lead to an economically -sound technical process.The presence of iron as a catalyst for lowering the reaction temperature is considered to be essential by Bucher (previously quoted). He goes so far as to attribute the lack of success of all previous com-mercial undertakings to the fact that the importance of this point, disclosed by Thompson, was not realised. According to the account published by Bucher of a number of experiments made with sodium carbonate mixtures, the formation of cyanide can be effectively carried out at a temperature of 920o to 950o C. when iron is employed as a catalyst.Character of Reaction Mixture.Various forms of reaction mixtures have been employed or proposed, in some cases consisting of simple mixtures of metallic salt and crushed coke or charcoal, and in others of briquettes made by agglo-merating the mixture with a binding material, such as pitch, and then strongly igniting or heating in a reducing flame. The latter type of mixture has been more particularly employed for the barium cyanide process, the barium carbonate initially incorporated in the mixture being in some cases either wholly or partly converted into barium oxide during the coking stage. The advantage of employing an intimate mixture in the form of a porous mass was recognized by several investigators.More recently Bucher has given considerable attention to the preparation of briquettes, containing an intimate mixture of the reagents in a fine state of divi-sion, without the employment of foreign binding agents. He mentions two methods of accomplishing this in the case of sodium carbonate mixtures, the first consisting in heating the mixture out of contact with air to the melting point of soda ash and then agglomerating by slight pressure. The second method, which he considers to be more practical, consists in treating the mixture with hot water under such conditions that the heat of hydration of the soda ash, when supplemented by rapid drying, results in the production of briquettes of the necessary compactness. Bucher also investi-gated the effect of varying the proportion of soda ash in the briquettes and found, as the result of &quot; rough quantitative &quot; experiments, that the yield of cyanide was definitely influenced and the rate of reaction altered, the latter becoming more sluggish with increasing percentages of soda ash.Little importance appears to have been attached by early investigators to the particular form of carbon employed for the reaction mixture, although it was noted, for example by Newton, that wood charcoal gave better results than coke. It is pointed out, however, by Bucher that if coke is employed, the accumulation of ash would be detrimental to the operation of a continuous cyanide process.  He there-
fore contemplates the production of finely divided pure carbon in the reaction mass itself by a method proposed by a previous investigator, namely, by the decomposition of carbon monoxide according to the following equation: 200 = 00s 4- 0 4- 38,080 cals.By this means he considers that it may be possible to avoid grinding the carbon and mixing it with the other ingredients as hitherto. He also points out that the evolution of heat in the mixture itself will assist the main reaction. According to Bucher&apos;s experiments the decomposition of carbon monoxide is greatly facilitated by the presence of an iron catalyst. It is not clear, however, that the reaction indicated above was actually utilised by him for the production of the necessary carbon in a mixture containing sodium carbonate and iron alone.Quality o  Nitrogen required.The production of cyanides from alkali and barium salts can be effected by the employment of various impure forms of nitrogen. The process was originally carried out with air, but an important advance was made by Margueritte and Sourdeval, who took steps to eliminate all the oxygen by passing the air over glowing coke, before admission to the reaction mixture.Among other gases containing nitrogen that have been proposed or employed, mention may be made of the waste, gases from sulphuric acid chambers and from the ammonia-soda process, and of producer gas. From the practical point of view the employment of producer gas would appear to offer a distinct advantage, since the nitrogen - is supplied in a heated condition. Moreover, the carbon monoxide in the gas might possibly be utilised as a source of finely divided carbon and to liberate a certain amount of heat in the body of the reaction mixture in accordance with the equation previously given, although it has still to be established that this can be effected successfully on a technical scale.Other investigators have shown that the nitrogen gases employed should be as free as possible from oxygen, carbon dioxide and moisture,) mce these have a deleterious action upon the formation of cyanide.Yield ol Combined Nitrogen.The evidence available as to the amount of nitrogen that can be fixed by alkali and barium bases in the production of cyanides is summarised in the following paragraphs.With Alkali Bases. One of the earliest attempts to operate upon a commercial scale was made at Newcastle in 1844, the cyanide process being used as a method of manufacturing potassium ferrocyanide. It appears that the crude furnace product contained 30 to 50 per cent, of potassium cyanide, corresponding to from 6*4 to 10 * 8 per cent, of combined nitrogen (Robine &amp; Lenglen, previously quoted).According to the results of the small and large scale experiments carried out by Bucher with sodium carbonate and iron mixtures, the amount of actual sodium cyanide in the products of reaction appears to have varied from 20 to 30 per cent., corresponding to from 5-7 to 8-6 per cent, of combined nitrogen. Bucher considers that with larger or continuously acting furnaces, it should be easy to obtain cyanized briquettes containing at least 30 to 35 per cent, of actual sodium cyanide, corresponding to from 8-6 to 10 per cent, of combined nitrogen. It is interesting to note in this connection that Tauber, in the course of his researches upon the influence of metallic iron, found it possible with some certainty to convert 10 per cent, of the soda used into sodium cyanide, in some ^ cases the yield being more than 25 per cent. (Berichte, previously quoted.)In the course of an unsuccessful attempt by Bettel to manufacture potassium cyanide, it was found that under the most favourable conditions only 25 per cent, of the potassium carbonate in the reaction mixture could be converted into cyanide.  (Norton, p. 125.)With Barium Salts as Bases. With regard to the barium process, it appears from the operations of Mond that the crude products of reaction contained about 39 to 40 per cent, of barium cyanide, corre-sponding to about 5&apos; 8 to 519 per cent, of combined nitrogen.   (Robine &amp; Lenglen, previously.quoted.)Information concerning the Readman process, winch is described, later, indicates that the furnace product also contained about 5*8 per cent, to 5&apos;9 per cent, of fixed nitrogen, some 4*8 per cent, being in the form of barium cyanide and the remainder in the form of other compounds such as barium cyanamide.According to other authoritative evidence supplied to the Sub-Committee, the barium process cannot be made to yield a product containing more than 50 per cent, of barium cyanide and cyanamide.Upon the basis of the above figures, cyanide pro-cesses are at a distinct disadvantage as compared with the calcium cyanamide process which yields a primary product containing from 19 to 20 per cent, of combined nitrogen.SEMI-INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS.Several serious attempts have been made to establish cyanide and ammonia processes on a semi-industrial or commercial basis, but hitherto without success. These attempts may be broadly classified under the same two headings as before, namely, those involving the use of alkalies and those involving the use of barium salts. A short summary of the more important efforts is given below, and it is interesting to note that several of these have been carried out in the United Kingdom.Processes utilising Alkalies.A process for making potassium ferrocyanide was worked at a small factory near Paris in 1843 by the French chemists, Possoz and Boissiere, but as the product Avas not able to ,meet foreign competition owing to the high cost of fuel and of refractory brick, the factory was subsequently transferred to Newcastle in this country. The plant was in operation there for three years during 1844-1847 and regularly pro-duced about 1 ton of potassium ferrocyanide per day, but the manufacture was eventually abandoned as too costly.Operations at Newcastle.   The reaction mixture employed consisted of good quality wood charcoal saturated with 20 to 30 per cent, of caustic potash or potassium carbonate made up with just sufficient water to dissolve it. The material was desiccated and charged into vertical retorts the upper part of which consisted of refractory clay and the lower part of iron, the latter serving as a cooling chamber. The retorts were heated externally to a white heat, and a portion of the gaseous products of combustion, rich in nitrogen, was passed through a superheater and admitted to the retorts. The reaction was con-tinued for 10 hours, and automatic arrangements were provided for removing a regulated quantity of the cyanized mixture and for charging in a corresponding amount of fresh mixture, thus rendering the operation semi-continuous.The plant comprised 24 retorts, of which 20 were in operation together, and each retort dealt with 720 kg. of mixture, containing 460 kg. of charcoal and 260 kg. of potassium carbonate, every 24 hours. The mixture decreased in volume by one half during the process and the product contained from 30 to 50 per cent, of potassium cyanide. The latter was dissolved out of the mass and converted into potassium ferro-cyanide by treatment with an iron salt, each retort yielding 50 to 70 kg. of ferrocyanide per day.It should be noted that the quantity of reaction mixture required for the production of a metric ton of ferrocyanide upon the basis of the above figures is not in accordance with the items in the statement of cost set out below.The nett cost at the works in 1846 amounted to 1 - 86 francs (1719 pence) per kg.  of ferrocyanide
3(Robbie A Lenglon, previously quoted), tho items of cost being given as follows:-Per 1,000 Kg, of Ferrooyanide,Prunes.     &amp;17:&quot;)	7-0500	20-0210	9-650	2-025	1 -I)37 a	15-0500	20-01 ^	 74-0Crushed woo 1 charcoal: 7,000 kg.at 2; 50 fr, per 100 kg.   -Potash from America: 1,000 kg.at. 50 fr. per 100 kg. Coke : 30 tons at 8 fr. per ton -Coal : 20 tons at 2&apos;50 fr. per ton Powdered carbonate of iron : It mi Labour : 120 men and children -Maintenance,  repairs, interest,etc......total the above figures indicate that the cost of main-tenance, repairs, etc., amounted to nearly 27 per cent, of the total.Assuming the production of the crystalline salt K4 Fe(CN)8 3H30, containing approximately 20 per cent, of nitrogen, the cost of operating the process was equivalent to about  373 per metric ton of combined nitrogen produced in the form of potassium ferro-cyanide (20 per cent. N).Another factory was started at Newcastle by Eramwell after some improvements had been made in the process, but in this case also the project was abandoned after considerable loss had been incurred.It appears that the lack of success in these cases was due to the high temperature required, which necessitated a large consumption of fuel, to heavy wear and tear of the furnaces, and to the considerable loss of potash by volatilization, amounting to about three parts for every part of prussiate produced. Only about 4 per cent, of the nitrogen used was fixed, and the yield was too small to enable cyanide to be pro-duced at a competitive price. Moreover, the product obtained was so impure that considerable cost was involved in its purification. (Robine &amp; Lenglen, pre-viously quoted.)Buckets Investigations. Reference has besn made to the experimental work of Buoher carried out in America since 1912, and an indication given of some of the results obtained. According to the evidence published, the experiments were conducted on both a laboratory and a semi-technical scale, the iron tubes employed varying from ^ in. to 8 in. in diameter and from 30 in. to 22 ft. in length. The charge of briquetted material required for the largest tubes amounted to 500 lb., and as much as 3,000 lb. of l-eaction mixture was dealt with in the course of 24 hours. Fairly satisfactory yields appear to have been obtained by working with externally heated iron tubes at tempera-tures of from 900o to 9500 0.. although in some cases temperatures of l,000o 0. and upwards are referred to. In other experiments, the heating was effected by the employment of simple forms of electric furnaces and the results were also considered to be satisfactory. No definite information is given as to the consumption of electrical energy per unit of combined nitrogen recovered. In one instance, however, Bucher states with &quot; current available &quot; of &quot; not over about 9 kilo-watts,&quot; a charge consisting of 15 lb. of briquettes was worked off in 3 hours, the product containing 25 per cent, of actual sodium cyanide. According to these figures, an approximate calculation appears to show that the power requirements per kilogramme of nitrogen fixed were of the order of 64 k.w,-hours.It must be noted that most of the experiments involving electrical heating of which details are given, seem to have depended upon the employment of the walls of the iron tubes themselves as resistance elements, so that the heating was practically external. In discussing the question of internal electrical heating, however, Bucher states that he had made trials using the furnace charge as a resistance with very hopeful results which he is &quot; not at liberty to disclose.&quot;Various factors having an important bearing upon the practical application of the process are indicated in the course of the experiments. It is shown, for example, that the heat penetration is slow, even when using externally heated iron tubes of small diameter, owing to the low thermal conductivity of Boda ash.It is stated, however, that the time required for heating the charge can be substantially reduced by internal electrical heating if the briquettes are heated to allow the current to start, or are placed in a furnace which-is already hot, on account of the rapid increase in the electrical conductivity of soda ash at higher temperatures. Reference is also made to the volatilization of the cyanide during the process, the sticking of the material in parts of the apparatus owing to the plastic condition attained by tho reaction mass, the destructive action of carbon monoxide upon the cyanide when the cyanized briquettes tire allowea to cool off in a current of producer gas, and to the troubles experienced with horizontal retorts through the sagging of the charge and the consequent provision of a free passage for the nitrogen. Methods are indicated whereby these difficulties were or might be overcome in larger scale operations.Bueher discusses the theory of the discontinuous or batch process and of the continuous process, and concludes that internal heating is the most promising, either electrically or by the decomposition of the carbon monoxide in producer gas in the presence of iron according to the equation previously given.With regard to the extraction of the cyanide from the reaction mass, Bucher shows that if the product is made into a stiff paste with water and steamed in an agitator, sodium forrocyanide is formed and hydrogen evolved on account of the presence of the finely divided iron catalyst. If it is desired to obtain sodium cyanide by lixiviation, the operation has to be carried out rapidly at a temperature slightly above 35Q 0. in order to avoid the &quot;setting&quot; of the mass, which Bucher attributes to the hydratiori of the sodium cyanide, and also to avoid losses due to the ferrocyanide reaction which proceeds slowly even at the temperature mentioned.Bucher enumerates a number of causes that have contributed to the failure of all previous commercial operations in connection with the cyanide process, the chief of which he considers to be the omission of iron from the reaction mixture, He also considers that iron is probably the only suitable technical catalyst when alkali carbonates are employed.Processes involving Barium Salts.The other base upon which commercial trials have been made is caustic baryta which, in the presence of carbon, is much more active towards nitrogen than potash and is much less volatile. On account of its relative infusibility at the reaction temperatures involved, the baryta mixture does not cake on the exterior and the penetration of the nitrogen gases to the interior of the mass is not impeded.Investigations by French Chemists. The barium process was carried on for several years, from about 1862, by the French chemists Margueritte and Sourdeval, who utilised a mixture of barium carbonate, coal-tar, pitch and sawdust, with or without iron filings. The mixture was strongly ignited to convert the carbonate into barium oxide, and the porous mass was treated with a slow current of air from which the oxygen was eliminated by passage over glowing coke. The reaction mass, after being cooled to about 300o 0., was exposed to the action of a current of steam for the purpose of converting the crude cyanide into ammonia. The process was operated primarily for the production of ammonia, but was eventually abandoned owing to technical difficulties and on account of the costs involved.MonaVs Barium Process. The barium process was taken up again, however, by Mond in 1882, and was worked out in very careful detail. The mixture employed, consisting of barium carbonate, coke or charcoal, and pitch, was agglomerated into briquette form and heated in a reducing atmosphere until the pitch was coked and the carbonate wholly or partly converted into oxide. The briquettes were charged into earthenware retorts, arranged in a circle, after the manner of a Hoffmann brick-kiln, with a view to thermal economy, and treated with a gaseous mixture rich in nitrogen but containing little carbon dioxide, oxygen, or moisture. The entering gases were pre-heated to a temperature of about l,400o 0., and the sources of nitrogBn contemplated or employed wera the waste
gases from the ammonia-soda process, ana producer gas obtained by the combustion of coal or coke with the minimum quantity of air.When a sufficient quantity of cyanide had been formed the stream of hot gas was shut off and cold gas of the same or similar composition was passed through the mass until the temperature had fallen to about 500o C. At this stage the gas supply was cut off and the material treated with steam in situ, in order to convert the cyanide nitrogen into ammonia. As an alternative, the reaction mass could be discharged and treated in a separate container with steam or a spray of water at a temperature of 300o to 500o&apos;C. If, how-ever, the product was required in the form of cyanide, the mixture, after cooling to at least 500o 0., was removed from the retorts and lixiviated with Water, the cyanide being recovered from the solution in the usual manner. The carbon monoxide evolved during the cyanide stage was used as a source of heat. The process, although tried on a fairly large scale, did not lead to practical results on account of the large ex-penditure of fuel required, as many as 97,000 metrical heat units per kg. molecule of cyanide having to be communicated through the walls of the earthenware retorts. (Lunge, previously quoted.) The yield of barium cyanide in the crude reaction product is stated to have been about 40 per cent. (Robine &amp; Lenglen, previously quoted.)Scottish  Cyanides  Co.&apos;s  Operations.   The next serious attempt to operate the barium process was made in Scotland by the Scottish Cyanides Co.  The method adopted was based upon Readman&apos;s patent, and  differed from  others hitherto  tried in  that internal electrical heating was employed, thus to some extent anticipating the subsequent development of the calcium carbide and cyanamide processes.   The electric furnaces consisted of carbon cylinders mounted upon water-cooled iron cylinders into which the furnace product was discharged after the reaction.   The carbon cylinder constituted one electrode, the other being attached to the top of the furnace so that the current -passed through the charge which acted as a resistance. The mixture employed consisted of barium carbonate and carbon briquetted with pitch, and was treated with impure nitrogen in the form of producer gas.   The crude barium cyanide obtained was lixiviated, and the solution converted into the sodium salt, the baryta being recovered and used again.  According to the evidence available, the fixation of a ton of nitrogen involved the employment of about 36 * 9 tons of uncoked reaction mixture which was reduced by coking to about 2411 tons prior to being charged into the furnaces.    The furnace product amounted to 17&quot;2 tons and contained about 5-8 per cent, of nitro-gen, some 4 - 8 per cent, being in the form of cyanide nitrogen, as previously indicated,   The electric current supplied to the furnaces was at a pressure of 40 volts, and the consumption of energy appears to have amounted to about 34 k.w.-hours per kg. of cyanide nitrogen fixed, or about 28 k.w.-hours per kg. of total nitrogen fixed, as compared with about 74 k.w.-hours in the case of the arc process and about 18 tc 20 k.w.-hours in the case of the cyanamide process.The works were on a considerable scale, and with 8 furnaces in operation, each capable of dealing with about 1-5 cwt. of mixture per hour, the capacity of the plant was about 100 tons of mixture per week. A large quantity of sodium cyanide was made by the process.It has been stated that the production costs, with electrical energy costing about 0-3d per k.w.-hour, amounted to about 6d. per lb. ( 55 per metric ton), or about  197 per metric ton of combined nitrogen in the form of sodium cyanide (28 per cent. N). Diffi-culties were experienced in connection with the quality of the sodium cyanide produced, in its efficient recovery from the crude products, and also in the regeneration of the barium-carbon mixture for re-use. Moreover, the cost of the electrical energy was a serious factor, and although the process was worked for some years it was eventually abandoned prior to 1910, after more than  100,000 had been spent upon its development.The process was never operated as an ammonia process, but according to private information it seems possible that it might have been in a position to produce ammonium sulphate for about  10 per ton with electrical energy available at a figure of  3&apos;75 per k.w.-year. It is important to note in this con-nection that the whole of the fixed nitrogen in the furnace product was liberated as ammonia upon treatment with steam,The Badisehe Co.&apos;s Experiments. Tho barium pro-cess was also investigated in 1900 by the Badische Co., who found that when a mixture of barium carbonate and carbon was saturated with nitrogen at a tempera-ture of about l,500o 0,, 60 per cent, of the nitrogen fixed was in the form of barium cyanide and the remainder in the form of barium cyanamide. On lowering the temperature to at least 1,100&quot; C. and passing a current of acetylene through the apparatus during continued cooling, the whole of the cyanamide was converted into cyanide.   (Norton, p. 126.)The Worh of the British Cyanides Co. The attracted-tiveness of the barium process is shown by the fact that, from the year 1907 and onwards, another serious attempt has been made in this country by the British Cyanides Co. to establish it upon a works basis. According to evidence supplied to the Sub-Committee, it is stated that all the difficulties previously experienced in connection with the repeated utilisation of the barium mixture, in the purification of the materials, and in avoiding fusion of the reaction mass in the furnaces have been overcome after many experiments, both upon a laboratory and upon a small works scale. It is considered that the furnace problem, including the charging and discharging of the materials, is the only point remaining to be solved, and the construction of new extornally-heated furnaces&apos; has therefore been undertaken. The new furnaces are now being com-pleted, and, if successful, will have a capacity of about 10 tons of high grade sodium cyanide per week. On account of the ease with which ammonia can be obtained from the crude furnace product, it is con-cidered that the process, if proved as a cyanide process, is also proved as an ammonia-producing process, and that the cost of producing ammonia might not amount to more than  20 per ton.The Sub-Committee was informed that the furnaces would represent about 75 per cent, of the cost of the installation, the plant for handling and treating the barium-carbon mixture accounting for the remaining 25 per cent.QUANTITIES OP SOLID MATERIALS REQUIRED.It is of interest to consider in further detail some of the figures previously quoted from the point of view of the quantities of solid materials required for the production of a metric ton of combined nitrogen in the form of cyanide or ammonia.Since the cyanide processes yield a crude product which is not directly marketable, account must be taken not only of the quantities of initial reaction mixture needed for the manufacture of the crude furnace product but also of the quantities of the latter together with any other solid materials used in the subsequent recovery operations for obtaining a finished cyanide or ammonia.The figures set out below indicate the approximate quantities of reaction materials in metric tons, and are exclusive of the fuel required for heating purposes or for obtaining impure nitrogen in the form of pro-producer gas. No account is taken of any losses of combined nitrogen during the recovery operations, or of the number of times the different solid materials have to be handled during the entire process.For purposes of comparison, corresponding figures are given for the calcium cyanamide process which is allied to the cyanide processes and mainly involves the employment of solid materials.Using Alkali Carbonates.According to the figures given in connection with the operations at Newcastle in 1846, the quantity of raw materials employed per metric ton of ferrocyanide obtained amounted to 7,000 kg. of charcoal and 1,000 kg. of potash. Assuming as before the pro-duction of a crystalline salt containing approximately
APPENDIX V. : CYANIDE PROCESSES.29!320 per cent, of nitrogen, 40 tons of reaction mixture were needed per ton of combined nitrogen recovered. The other set of figures quoted for the same operations specify a yield of from 50 to 70 kg. of ferrocyanide from 720 kg. of reaction mixture, thus indicating the employment of from 72 to 51 - 4 tons of mixture per ton of combined nitrogen recovered. No account is taken in either case of the quantity of iron salts used in the conversion of the crude cyanide product, which contained from 30 to 50 per cent, of potassium cyanide, into ferrocyanide. Upon the basis of the last figures, and neglecting losses of combined nitrogen, the furnace product utilised in the recovery operations amounted to from 15&quot;5 to 9-3 tons. Even if allowance is made for a substantial loss of combined nitrogen, the striking differences between the quantities of material charged into and removed from the retorts may be emphasised as indicating the order of the losses that contributed to the failure of the undertaking. The scale of the fuel requirements, namely, 50 tons of coal and coke per 1,000&apos; kg. of ferrocyanide, or 250 tons per ton of combined nitrogen recovered in the form of ferro-cyanide, may also be noted in the same connection.Considering next an experimental example quoted by Bucher, it appears that a crude fuxmace product containing 30 per cent, of actual sodium cyanide was obtained from briquettes consisting of equal parts by weight of soda ash, carbon and metallic iron. This mixture corresponds approximately to the following molecular proportions:Na2 CO;i 4- S&apos;8C 4- l&apos;9Fe&apos; and contains a considerable excess of carbon in addi-tion to the iron catalyst. Assuming that no loss of carbonate or cyanide occurred, a process operated on the basis indicated would involve the employment of about 13- 6 tons of briquettes for every ton of nitrogen fixed in the form of crude furnace product, the latter amounting to about 11-6 tons and serving as the raw material for the recovery of finished cyanide or ammonia.Using Barium Carbonate.On the basis of the figures previously given, the Headman process, when operated for the production of cyanide, involved the use of about 44- 5 tons of uncoked barium mixture or 29 tons of coked mixture per ton of cyanide nitrogen fixed. The quantity of crude furnace product to be dealt with during the recovery operations amounted to 20*8 tons (4*8 per cent, of cyanide nitrogen), and the conversion of the barium cyanideinto sodium cyanido necessitated the employment of a minimum of 3 - 8 tons of soda ash. The quantities of materials involved would have been smaller if the process had been operated for the production of ammonia. In this case about 3G- 9 tons of uncoked barium mixture or 24-1 tons of coked mixture, yielding about 17&apos;2 tons of crude furnace product containing 518 per cent, of total nitrogen, would have served for the production of a metric ton of ammonia nitrogenThe Calcium Cyanamide Process.The approximate quantities of solid materials required for obtaining a metric ton of combined nitrogen in the form of calcium cyanamide are as follows (Section V.): In the first stage of the process, about 950 kg of lime and 620 kg. of anthracite are required per ton of carbide produced, the lime itself being obtained by roasting 1,750 kg. of limestone with about 230 kg. of coal. Neglecting the small consumption of electrodes, every ton of carbide manufactured thus involves the use of 3&apos; 55 tons of solid materials. Eor the second stage of the process, 4 tons of carbide have to be used as raw material in the cyanamide furnaces in order to fix a ton of nitrogen in the form of cyanamide (20 per cent. N). The quantity of raw materials thus required for the production of a ton of combined nitrogen amounts to 14&apos; 2 tons for the carbide stage and 4 tons for the cyanamide stage, a total of 18&apos;2 tons.If the combined nitrogen is required in the form of ammonia and conversion losses are neglected, the product from the cyanamide furnaces, amounting to 5 tons, has to be transferred to autoclaves for treatment with steam. A complete carbide-cyanamide and ammonia process therefore necessitates the treatment of 23&apos;2 tons of solid materials per ton of nitrogen recovered in the form of ammonia.Assuming that the waste gases from the carbide furnaces were utilised for roasting the limestone (Section V.), the total quantity of solid materials needed for the carbide-cyanamide stage would be about 17&apos;3 tons, corresponding to 22-3 tons for the complete ammonia process.The figures given above are summarised in the f follow-ing table, the first column showing the total quantity of solid raw materials necessary for fixing a metric ton of nitrogen. The second column indicates the quantity and the nitrogen content of the furnace products, and the last column the total quantity of materials needed when account is taken of the subsequent operations for the recovery of cyanide or ammonia.SOLID MATERIALS REQUIRED PER METRIC TON OP NITROGEN FIXED ORRECOVERED.Summary of Evidence.

The eyanamido process thus appears to be upon a parity with the alkali cyanide processes as far as the quantity of solid materials required for the production of ammonia is concerned. It stands to advantage, however, in yielding a primary product which not only has a much higher nitrogen content but is marketable without requiring auxiliary recovery, operations such as are necessary in the case of all cyanide processes.The effect of the high atomic weight of barium upon the quantities of solid materials dealt with is clearly indicated in the table at the foot of the previous page,GENERAL OBSERVATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS.The numerous efforts made to solve the problem of fixing atmospheric nitrogen in the form of cyanides afford a striking testimony to the advantages, whether real or apparent, which the process is considered to possess.Possible Advantages.In the first place, the reaction temperature is com-paratively low as contrasted with that involved in the manufacture of carbide for calcium cyanamide or in making nitric acid by the arc process (Sections III. and V.). On this account there has always been the pi-ospect of avoiding the use of relatively costly elec-trical energy in countries where cheap water-power is not available, and of devising a method whereby the process could be economically carried out by the direct use of fuel.In the second place, it has been clearly estab-lished that various impure forms of nitrogen, such as producer gas, can be employed for the cyanide process, so that the necessity for separating pure nitrogen from the air, as in the cyanamide and Haber processes, is avoided; having regard, however, to the low cost of separating nitrogen by modern liquefaction processes (Sections IV. and V.), this point cannot be considered as of great importance. In the third place, the plant required for carrying out the process appears to be of a comparatively simple nature so that the capital outlay should be moderate. Mention may also be made of the possibility of devising a continuous cyanide-ammonia process, which is discussed later, and of the inexpensive character of the raw materials required.Practical Difficulties.On the other hand, practical difficulties have still to be solved in rendering the process a commercial one, as is clear from past failures, and the apparent advantage of the comparatively low reaction tem-peratures has not yet been realised in practice.In the first place, cyanide processes are hampered by the well-known fluxing properties of alkali car-bonates and baryta at the temperatures in question. The reaction mass when in a plastic or fused condition has a very corrosive action upon most refractory materials, becomes less pervious to nitrogen, and is troublesome to discharge from the apparatus. Fur-ther, the volatility of the cyanides and alkali bases may result in appreciable losses, as has been noted in connection with previous operations. In the next place, a suitable apparatus and method of heating capable of economical operation have not yet been developed on a works scale.External Heating. In considering the question of external heating, it is important to remember that the temperatures involved are above the limit at which iron retorts will stand up under continuous working. Although Bucher claims that a reaction mixture containing sodium carbonate and iron will fix nitrogen at about 900o to 950o 0., even these temperatures are too high for iron vessels in continuous operation. The employment of ordinary refractory materials for the retorts is also attended with serious disadvantages on account of corrosion a,nd of the considerable increase  in  the  fuel  requirements  for   external heating of tho retorts,Internal Healing. On the other hand, internal heating of the charge by means of gaseous fuels is attended by the difficulty that the&apos; necessary oxygen required and the products of combustion, such as carbon dioxide and moisture, are detrimental to the formation of cyanides. It has been suggested, how-ever, that these difficulties might be overcome by the use of producer gas.From a consideration of the results of past achievements, it would appear that the application of internal electrical heating making use of the charge itself as a resistance, as in the operation of Readman&apos;s barium process, is likely to offer some prospects of success.Power Requirements.With regard to the question of power requirements, the temperatures necessary in the barium process &apos; are considerably higher than those which have been indicated by Bucher in the case of sodium carbonate mixtures containing metallic iron, In the event of it being established that the addition of iron enables the sodium process to be effectively carried out under commercial conditions at temperatures of the order of 900o to 950o 0., the power requirements should be substantially lower than those of the barium process as operated in Scotland. An approximate calculation, based upon the consumption of electrical energy by the latter process, appears to indicate that the power requirements of the sodium process when using iron in the mixture would not exceed about 19 k.w.-hours per kg. of nitrogen fixed, as compared with about 18 to 20 k.w.-hours in the case of the calcium cyanamide process, and there is reason for believing that the figure might be still lower.Marketable Products.The primary product of the cyanide processes is only a crude material requiring further treatment before the combined nitrogen is obtained in a marketable form. On this account, the large quantity of solid raw materials to be handled is an obvious disadvantage. The use of reaction mixtures containing the large proportions of metallic iron specified by Bucher would appear to add to this disadvantage in addition to limiting the possible yield of cyanide from a given furnace charge, Past experience has also shown that the extraction of the crude cyanide and its conversion into a solid salt present difficulties and may be attended with losses of combined nitrogen. . Moreover, it is not possible by evaporation alone to obtain the high strength fused cyanide which the market demands.Possible Continuous Ammonia Process.Efforts have been made to minimise or avoid the handling of solid materials by rendering the process a continuous one particularly when used for the manu-facture of ammonia, but the problem is not straight-forward owing to the necessity for auxiliary treatment to renew the carbon content of the reaction mixture which is depleted during the cyanide stage. There appears, however, to be a possibility that the process could be so arranged as to produce ammonia without removing the materials from the retort or furnace by steaming the cyanized product in situ for liberating ammonia and then replacing the necessary carbon in the reaction mass in situ by utilising the. decomposition of carbon monoxide in accordance with the equation previously given.A method of operation of this character might prove economical even if internal electrical heating were necessary for effecting the main reaction. The employment of reaction mixtures containing metallic iron, may, however, lead to complications in devising a continuous ammonia process owing to the fact that the treatment of the crude cyanide with steam under certain conditions results in the formation of ferro-cyamde and not in the evolution of ammonia
Economic Considerations.No definite evidence is available as to the probable costs of operating cyanide processes under modern commercial conditions, It is important to remember, however, that the value of combined nitrogen in the form of pure cyanide is high, the average (1911-13) pre-war market price of sodium cyanide being Id. per lb., or  64&apos;3 per metric ton, which is equivalent to approximately  230 per metric ton of combined nitrogen in the form of sodium cyanide (28 per cent. N). On the other hand, the corre-sponding market price of combined nitrogen in the form of ammonium sulphate (25 per cent. NH;t) only amounted to  66-1 per metric ton. The economic position of the process when considered from the point of view of cyanide manufacture will thus be substantially different from its position as an ammonia process. If the process has to be worked upon the batch or discontinuous system, involving the removal of the reaction mass from the retorts or furnaces for auxiliary treatment, commercial success in making cyanide might be quite consistent with failure as regards the manufacture of ammonia. . Should itprove possible, however,, to treat, decompose, and re-generate the furnace mixture in situ, the process in such a form might prove successful for the manu-facture of ammonia. Experimental investigations in this direction appear to be desirable.It is clear from the work of many investigators that there is no difficulty in producing cyanide or ammonia on the laboratory scale or upon&apos; a large experimental scale. The problem of translating the process to a works scale, however, has hitherto bee a attended with less success than that attained in the case of other apparently more difficult nitrogen fixation processes. 4From a general, consideration of the evidence and of the history of past failures, it appears doubtful whether cyanide processes can be made commercially successful if reliance is placed upon external heating. But with internal heating, either by means of producer gas or electricity, and with the assistance of engineering, skill such as has been devoted to other fixation pro-cesses, there appears to be a possibility of placing the cyanide processes in a position to compete with other synthetic processes on nearly equal terms.
NITROGEN PRODUCTS COMMITTEE: FINAL REPORT. SECTION XI.THE SERPEK OR ALUMINIUM NITRIDEPROCESS.Many metals and non-metals show a marked affinity for nitrogen, and combine directly with it to form nitrides. On account of the high nitrogen content of some of these compounds (nitrides containing upwards of 50 per cent, of nitrogen having been prepared), and of the comparative facility with which the nitrogen can be liberated in the form of ammonia, many pro-posals have been made for utilising the nitride reaction as a method of fixing atmospheric nitrogen. Owing, however, to the high price of the metals which show the most marked affinity for nitrogen, it has not hitherto been commercially feasible to utilise such metals directly, and endeavours have been made to solve the problem by methods which avoid the direct use of the metals themselves. Of the various processes that have been proposed in this connection, the aluminium nitride process of Serpek has, perhaps, attracted the most attention, and appears to be the only one that has been experimented with upon a sufficient scale to justify its consideration as a commercial possibility.A useful summary of the position and prospects of the process was published in 1912 (Norton, Utilisation of Atmospheric Nitrogen), and a certain amount of information of more recent date is also available (Matignon, Bulletin de la Societe d&apos;Encouragement pour VIndustrie National&apos;.&apos;, 1913, Vol. 119, No. 6, pp. 817-825; Rochet, Comptes Bendus Mensuels de la Societe de VIndustrie Minerale, January 1915, pp. 11-14).The Serpek process, as indicated later, also holds out the prospect of associating the fixation of nitrogen with the production of a pure alumina for the manu-facture of aluminium. The developments that have taken place in the aluminium industry during the war. period, and the probability of a still further extension after the war, may have a marked influence upon the future of the process, and it has therefore been considered desirable to summarise the information available concerning it.Formation of Aluminium Nitride.In the early investigations of the- process the raw material employed consisted of aluminium carbide. The behaviour of this carbide when treated with nitrogen at an elevated temperature is different from that of the alkali and alkaline earth carbides (Section X), the absorption of the nitrogen resulting in the for-mation of aluminium nitride and not of cyanide or cyanamide or a mixture of these products. It was subsequently found that the separate preparation of aluminium carbide could be avoided by utilising a mixture of alumina and carbon or coal. According to the view held by Serpek, the alumina was partly converted into carbide which reacted with the re-maining alumina to produce free aluminium, the latter then combining with the nitrogen to form nitride.-3 The complete reaction can be represented by the following equation: AlA-f3C4-N.2     AhjNj+300.Other investigations have shown that mixtures of alumina and coal are more active towards nitrogen when various metallic oxides are also present in moderate proportions (Norton, p. 141), and that impure alumina, in the form of minerals like bauxite, is well suited as a raw material for the nitride process (Rochet, previously quoted).The reaction between nitrogen and metallic alu-minium is strongly exothermic, the heat of formation of a gm. molecule (A12N:j) of the nitride at tempera-tures ia the neighbourhood of 750o to 800&quot;C being ofthe order of 110,000 gm. cals. In consequence, however, of the great heat of formation of aluminium oxide, the reaction involved in the manufacture of nitride from a mixture of alumina and coal is strongly endothermic, the formation of a gm. molecule of the nitride being accompanied by the absorption of from 183,000 to 187,600 gm. cals. (Matignon and Rochet, previously quoted.)The Temperature   of   Reaction   and  Power Requirements.The temperatures necessary for effecting the re-action are substantially higher than those required in the cyanide processes (Section X.), ranging up to l,800oC. The absorption of the nitrogen begins at a lower temperature, of the order of l,100oC, but the rate of absorption and the yield of nitride show a marked increase at higher temperatures.As in the case of the cyanide processes, impure nitrogen in the form of producer gas can be employed for the reaction. It should be noted, however, that the reaction is a reversible one&apos;, and the equilibrium conditions depend upon the concentration of the carbon monoxide in the gaseous phase. For a given temperature, an increase in the concentration of carbon monoxide results in a diminution in the amount of nitrogen fixed. As the proportion of carbon monoxide in the gas mixture increases with increasing tem-temperature, the utilisation of impure nitrogen, such as producer gas, which already contains a large per-centage of carbon monoxide, thus necessitates the use of higher temperatures for the reaction than would be required if pure nitrogen were used.The carbon monoxide evolved during the reaction represents a potential source of heat, its complete combustion yielding 204,600 gm. cals., which is in excess of the heat required for the formation of the nitride. From a practical point of view, however, the heat of combustion of the carbon monoxide is less useful than an equivalent amount of electrical energy, but the utilisation of the heat regeneratively for pre-heating the bauxite prior to its admission to the furnaces, results in a considerable economy in the thermal, requirements of the process (Matignon previously quoted).It has been stated that the total power require-ments of the Serpek process vary from 10 to 12 k.w.-hours per kg. of nitrogen fixed (see Norton, p. 140; Lunge, Coal Tar and Ammonia, 1916, Part 3, pp. 1102-1110). This is equivalent to about 1*18 to 1 - 42 k.w.-years of 8,400 to 8,500 hours per metric ton of nitrogen fixed, as compared with 1-97 to 2-3 k.w.-years in the case of the cyanamide process, and with 8-41 k.w.-years of 8,760 hours in the case of the arc process (Sections III. and V.).Yield of Combined Nitrogen.The preparation of pure aluminium nitride, which contains just over 34 per cent, of nitrogen, has been effected by the Serpok process. When a high grade bauxite is employed as the raw material, it appears that practically the whole of the alumina in the bauxite can be converted into nitride. For example, it has been stated that the production of a nitride containing 25 to 26 per cent, of nitrogen from bauxite containing some 75 per cent, of alumina was currently effected at Serpeks works (Norton, pp. 145-46).According to more recent information dealing with the investigations of the process at Salindres, in France, it is claimed that a yield of 776 kg. of commercial ammonium sulphate containing 20-8 to 21 per cent.
of nitrogen can be obtained from a metric ton of bauxite containing GO per cent, of alumina (Rochet, previously quoted). On the basis of these figures, the yield of aluminium nitride per metric ton of bauxite amounts to from 472 or 477 kg. as compared with a theoretical yield of about 482 kg. from GOO kg. of pure alumina, so that the conversion of 98 per cent, to 99 per cent, of the alumina in the raw material is thus indicated,Properties of Aluminium Nitride.Aluminium nitride, especially the crystalline pro-duct obtained from mixtures of alumina and carbon, is very -stable in dry air; Even at 800o C. it is decom-posed very slowly, and oxidation is never complete even in the presence of pure oxygen. The nitride can be heated in an atmosphere of nitrogen to a temperature in the neighbourhood of 22000 0. without signs of fusion or dissociation; moreover, hydrogen and hydro-carbons are without action upon it. The nitride is also characterised by highly refractory qualities, and by low thermal conductivity and high electrical resistance at elevated temperatures (Rochet and Lunge, previously quoted). On account of the latter qualities, the nitride has been employed not only as a lining for the furnaces in which it is produced but also for the electrical heating elements of the furnaces.Production of Ammonia from Aluminium Nitride.The evidence relating to the production of ammonia and ammonium salts from aluminium nitride is some-what contradictory, as shown by the summary given below.Aluminium nitride is stated to be decomposed by water and more easily by steam under pressure, the nitrogen being liberated in the form of ammonia and the aluminium being converted into oxide or hydroxide. The reaction is greatly facilitated by the presence of small quantities of alkali (Rochet, previously quoted).According, however, to a statement by Serpek, even boiling water at ordinary pressures does not act very easily upon the nitride, but under pressures of 4 to 6 atmospheres the latter is completely decomposed in about two to three hours. Moreover, steam has no action upon the nitride at high temperatures (Lunge, previously quoted).It is also stated that the nitride is decomposed by acids yielding the corresponding salts of ammonium and aluminium. In the case of sulphuric acid, for example, the reaction is attributed to the following equation (Rochet, previously quoted):  A12N, -f 4H2SO, = (NH4),S04 4- Al2(S04):i.On the other hand, by using a limited quantity of acid the reaction results in the formation of an ammonium salt and aluminium hydroxide according to the following equation (Norton, p. 142): &apos; AloNo4-H2S04 -4- 6H20^(NH.,)2 S04 f Al, (0H)this reaction appears to occur in two stages, a portion of the nitride being transformed into salts of am-monhnn and aluminium during the first stage. The aluminium salt then reacts upon the undecomposed nitride, yielding an ammonium salt and aluminium hydroxide in the following manner: 3Al2N4-t-Al3 (SO4):i-(-24H20^3 (NH4)1S04-r4Al,(0H)6.It appears, therefore, to be technically feasible to use a solution of aluminium sulphate for decomposing crude nitride in order to obtain alumina as a by-product (Norton, p. 142).With regard to the above reactions with acids, it is worthy of note that, according to a statement attributed to Serpek, the nitride resists all acids and is only slowly decomposed by hydrofluoric acid (Lunge, previously quoted).Solutions of alkalies also decompose the nitride with great facility, yielding ammonia and a solution of aluminate of soda from which pure alumina can be recovered. It has been claimed that the facility with which the ammonia is liberated by alkalies constitutes one of the principal superiorities of aluminium nitride as compared with other nitrides, such as those of silicon and titanium, which, under similar conditions, onlyyield their nitrogen with difficulty, and even then incompletely (Rochet, previously quoted),Many of the above reactions, it wtfll be observed, result in the direct or indirect regeneration of alumina&apos;. There is thus the possibility of devising a continuous nitrogen fixation process for the production of am-monia from atmospheric nitrogen through the inter-intermediary of aluminium nitride, the original alumina being regenerated in the ammonia stage for further use in the nitride stage. In this respect the nitride process has a close analogy with the cyanide processes (Section X.).The Nitride Process and the Aluminium Industry.The Serpek process appears to have considerable attractions as a stage in the aluminium industry, combining, as it does, a method of obtaining pure alumina, which may have advantages over existing processes, with the recovery of synthetic ammonia as a by-product.A. process devised by Bayer for the preparation of pure alumina involves the treatment of bauxite in an autoclave at a pressure of about 7 kg. per sq. cm, (100 lb. per sq. in.) with a solution of caustic soda having a concentration of about 40o Be. The resulting solution of aluminate of soda, after the separation of the insoluble residue, is diluted with water or weak alkali until the concentration has been reduced to about 240 Be. From the latter solution hydrated alumina is precipitated on standing, the process being facilitated by agitation, by certain conditions of temperature, and especially by the presence of sufficient quantities of hydrated alumina in suspension. After the re-moval of the precipitated alumina, however, it is necessary to re-concentrate the caustic soda solution to about 40o Be in order to render it suitable for treat-ing further quantities of bauxite (Favre, Comptes Bendus Mensuels, Jan. 1915, pp. 4-11).The decomposition of aluminium nitride for the production of ammonia is easily effected by boiling under slight press\ire with a solution of caustic soda having a concentration of 20 to 210 Be, the aluminium passing into solution as aluminate of soda. Pure alumina can then be precipitated, as in the Bayer process, and the resulting solution of caustic soda can be utilised directly for the treatment of further quantities of nitride without requiring re-concentration (Matignon, previously quoted), thus representing an economy in fuel as compared with the method described above.In considering the association of the Serpek process with the aluminium industry, it should be noted that the world&apos;s production of the metal in 1914 only amounted to approximately 70,000 metric tons. If the whole of the alumina required for the above output had been made by the Serpek process, the amount of ammonium sulphate recovered as a by-product would have been about 170,000 metric tons (Rochet, previously quoted), or roughly 11 per cent, of the world&apos;s pro-duction of sulphate at that date. The output of aluminium in the United Kingdom prior to the war only amounted to some 7,500 tons, and the adoption of the Serpek process in this country would have resulted in the recovery of less than 20,000 tons of ammonium sulphate, or about 5 per cent, of the output of the by-product industry.There has been a very large development in the aluminium industry during the war period, and it is probably safe to assume that the world&apos;s production at the present time is of the order of 150,000 to 200,000 tons per annum. On the basis of the latter figure, the utilisation of the Serpek process for the manu-facture of the whole of the necessary alumina would result in the recovery of about 500,000 tons of am-ammonium sulphate as a by-product. The world&apos;s visible supplies of ammonium sulphate early in 1914 amounted to about 1,500,000 tons, and it is known that the output has been substantially increased during the war period, particularly in Germany and in the United States.Even when allowance is made for such increases, it will be seen that the Serpek process, if generally adopted in the aluminium industry, might eventually lead to a veiy substantial contribution to the world&apos;s production of ammonium sulphate.
SEMI-INDUSTRIAL OPERATIONS.A good deal of experimental work upon a semi-technical scale was carried out by Serpek during the year 1905 and onwards at an installation near Mul-hause, in Alsace. According to evidence supplied to the Sub-Committee, the process was being worked successfully during 1911-1912, but the cost was stated to be prohibitive. The installation at that date comprised eight or nine electric furnaces, the largest of whicli was about 2 m. in length and capable of discharging about 3 cwt. of nitride. The employment of rotary kilns of the type used in the cement industry was at one time contemplated, and a firm in the United Kingdom was approached to go into the question of a design capable of operating at a temperature of l,020c C. with a reducing atmosphere. A suitable kiln was designed and tried at Sunderland, about 150 tons of crude bauxite being treated. The product, however, was not analysed, but was sent to Serpek&apos;s factory in Germany, and it was subsequently learned that a small percentage of aluminium nitride had been found in the calcined material. Although further negotiations took place, the matter was not carried to completion with the firm in this country.The process was eventually acquired by a French company with a view to its exploitation in connection with the aluminium industry, and a plant was con-structed in the Savoy district to produce about 30 tons of aluminium nitride per day. Owing to the high temperatures involved, and to the fact that few re-fractory materials are capable of withstanding tem-peratures higher than about l,600o 0., considerable difficulties were met with in constructing a suitable furnace; moreover, in carrying out the process a re-ducing atmosphere was necessary and the presence of carbon dioxide had to be avoided. On account of these factors it was found necessary to employ elec-trical heating, and the furnaces themselves were lined with amminium nitride, which possesses the requisite refractory qualities. An excess of carbon had also to be added to the reaction mixture in order to improve its conductivity.It is unnecessary for present purposes to describe the types of experimental furnaces that were employed, as details of these are to be found in technical publi-cations (e.g., Norton, pp. 139-40, and Matignon, pre-viously quoted). It is worthy of note, however, that some of the electric furnaces of the revolving cylinder type comprised cylinders 25 m. in length, and were fed with a current of 10,000 amps, at a pressure of 230 volts (Matignon, previously quoted).   --.Attempts were made to avoid a number of the diffi-culties encountered by modifying the method of operation and carrying out the process in two stages. In the first stage, bauxite containing from 55 to 65 per cent, of alumina and from 20 to 25 per cent, of iron oxide was reduced in an electric furnace, of the type employed in the manufacture of carbide or ferro-silicon, in order to produce an aluminium-iron alloy. This alloy was then heated to about l,200o C. in the presence of nitrogen, the latter being absorbed with considerable evolution of heat, sufficient not only to raise the temperature of the whole mass to about l,850o O, but also to convert the whole of the aluminium into nitride (Lunge, previously quoted).Although the two-stage process appears to be more easily carried out than the direct preparation of the nitride from ahunina and coal, the consumption of electrical energy required for the decomposition of equivalent quantities of alumina is less in the single-stage process owing to the fact that the heat of formation of the nitride compensates for part of the heat required for the reduction of the alumina (Rochet, previously quoted). In spite of the advantages that the single-stage process was considered to possess, the problems involved in devising suitable electrically heated fur-naces for effecting its operation had not been solved prior to the war, and investigations were still in progress.It was proposed to utilise the Serpek process in connection with an aluminium factory of 40,000 h.p. capacity under erection in Norway in 1914 (Rochet,previously quoted), but in view of the position of the process it was apparently decided to produce the necessary alumina by means of the Bayer method instead (Lunge, previously quoted).ECONOMIC ASPECTS.Little information is available as to the order of the costs likely to be involved in operating the Serpek process. Some interesting estimates, based upon theoretical considerations and upon thermal values, were prepared by Bougerel (Norton, pp. 144-46), and were considered by Norton to afford valuable approximations to what might be the more favourable results of actual practice.The following figures, which are exclusive of labour, electrode wear, etc., represent the estimated cost of producing a metric ton of combined nitrogen in the form of aluminium nitride (25 per cent. N) from bauxite containing 74 to 75 per cent, of alumina. It was assumed by Bougerel that only 59 per cent, of the alumina was converted into nitride, the remainder being lost in the form of a double silicate of iron and aluminium.Per 1,000 kg. of Combined Nitrogen.Bauxite: 7*5 tons, deliveredCoke : 2 tons, deliveredPower:   at  $13-51 ( 2-8) per c,h.p.-year  For fusion of bauxite For heating producer gas For reduction of bauxite -Total   -Dollars. 34-74 15-442G-20 5-37 35-20  7-24 3-225-40 1 12 7-33$116/95    24-37Norton calculated that if the whole of the alumina in the bauxite was utilised in the reaction, a further 254 kg. of nitrogen would be absorbed at an extra cost of $10-5 ( 2 -19) for power, thus making a total cost of  26-56 for 1,254 kg. of combined nitrogen, or  21-18 per metric ton. He also considered that the additional outlay involved in converting the com-bined nitrogen into ammonia and then into sulphate should not bring the cost of nitrogen in the form of sulphate above 7 cents per lb. ( 32-14 per metric ton), or less than half its market price in 1912.Upon the basis of the above figures, the cost of converting the nitride into ammonia and of fixing the latter would amount to about  11 per metric ton of combined nitrogen. Taking the cost of fixing a pure strong ammonia at  8 - 65 per metric ton of combined nitrogen in the form of sulphate (Section II.), the conversion costs alone would thus be of the order of  2-5 as compared with about  4 in the case of the cyanamide process (Section VI.).According to other figures quoted by Norton, the total cost of production, at the works, of nitride made from bauxite amounted to 55 centimes per kg. of com-bined nitrogen, equivalent to  22 per metric ton, In the case of pure nitride (34 per cent, nitrogen) made from alumina, the cost amounted to 1*04 francs per kg. of nitrogen, equivalent to  41 - 6 per metric ton.The products were on sale in France, the prices in 1911 being as follows, namely: crude aluminium nitride 6-5 cents per lb. of nitrogen, equivalent to  29-84 per metric ton, and pure aluminium nitride 11-8 cents per lb., equivalent to  54-18 per metric ton of nitrogen. The then current prices of combined nitrogen in the forms of Chile nitrate, ammonium sulphate and calcium cyanamide were 13 cents, 14-5 cents, and 10-1 cents per lb. respectively (Norton, p. 144), the equivalent prices per metric ton of combined nitrogen being  59 - 69,  66 - 58, and  46 - 37.According to Serpek, the cost of manufacturing pure alumina from aluminium nitride does not exceed 63 &quot;8 francs ( 2-55) per metric ton, whereas the cost of manufacture from bauxite, presumably by the Bayer process, amounts to 125-25 francs ( 5 -01) (Matignon, previously quoted). It may be noted that the latter figure is much below current practice.
APPENDIX.&apos; V. : SERPEK PROCESS.29?OBSERVATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS.Although the semi-industrial operations hitherto carried out have been attended with some measure of success, the establishment of the Serpek process upon a sound commercial; basis presents a number of dim-cult technical problems arising from the high tern-temperature necessary, the construction of a suitable form of electric furnace being the outstanding problem.Attempts have been made to overcome some of the difficulties by modifying the method of operation, but such modifications have been accompanied by a loss in economy. It is possible that further investigations upon the conditions of operation and the effect of catalysts may lead to the discovery of a method of effecting the formation of nitride direct from alumina at somewhat lower temperatures than those previously found necessary. Improvements in this direction would be of material advantage from the practical point of view. In this connection it is also open to question whether the apparent advantages involved in the employment of impure nitrogen in the form of producer gas are not more than outweighed by the higher reaction temperatures necessitated, especially when regard is had to the low cost of separating pure nitrogen from t be air by modern liquefaction processes (Sections IV. and V.).As regards the fixation of nitrogen, the aluminium nitride process offers the possibility of working with a limited quantity of raw material in a simple cycle of operations. It has yet to be established, however, that the regenerated alumina is as equally well adapted as the original material for conversion into nitride, and that the cost of regeneration is sufficiently eco-nomical to render it preferable to utilise the alumina in the cycle rather than for the manufacture of aluminium.The utilisation of the process for the manufacture of alumina with the recovery of combined nitrogen as a by-product appears to be the natural line of develop-ment, and the process has hitherto been viewed commercially mainly from this standpoint. As the result of a detailed examination of the work carried out upon the process, a leading electro-chemist closely associated with the aluminium industry has expressed the matured opinion that, while the Serpek process might ultimately be rendered of great value, at present it is certainly not a sound commercial proposition The large extension in the output of aluminium that has occurred during the war period, however, should serve to provide a further stimulus to the endeavours already made to bring the Serpek process to a successful issue.
SECTION XII.THE BENDER OR COMBUSTION PROCESS.It has long been known that when gases are burnt in air under suitable conditions, atmospheric nitrogen is oxidized to a limited extent, traces of nitric oxide occurring in the products of combustion. In ordinary circumstances the yield of combined nitrogen is extremely small, and numerous methods have - been suggested for increasing the yield in order to render the reaction capable of technical application for the manufacture of nitric acid and nitrates. Broadly speaking, most of the methods involve the combustion of gaseous fuels under such conditions that the tem-temperature is notably increased, the nitric oxide in the products of combustion being prevented as far as possible from dissociating by rapidly cooling the gases. In this field of investigation, the work of Bender has, perhaps, attracted most attention and appears to have been carried to a more advanced stage than that of other investigators.The combustion processes have a close analogy with the Hausser process (Section IX.), the aim in each case being to effect the oxidation of atmospheric nitrogen by the direct utilisation of the thermal energy of gaseous fuels instead of by the employment of electrical energy.Apart from the particulars given by Norton in his report of 1912 (Utilisation of Atmospheric Nitrogen), little information appears to have been published concerning the technical details and the developments of the Bender process. The Sub-Committee has deemed it necessary, however, to give consideration to the possibilities of the process, and a summary of the available information is set out below, together with some observations on the general characteristics of combustion processes.Description of Combustion Processes.Several methods have been, proposed by Bender for augmenting the temperature attained in the com-combustion of fuels and for cooling the products of combustion. According to one method, the oxidation of atmospheric nitrogen is effected in an ordinary furnace by introducing below the fuel bed and also into the hot gases above the fuel bed a current of air or oxygen which may be under pressure. High pressure superheated steam is sprayed into the hottest part of the combustion space above the fuel, and is partly dissociated, the hydrogen and oxygen mixing with the heated gases. It is stated that when tire mixture begins to cool in the upper part of the furnace, the hydrogen and oxygen recombine &quot;in an oxy-hydrogen flame which still further heats the reaction mixture,&quot; and causes the formation of nitric oxide, A jet of low temperature steam is introduced into the issuing gases in order to cool them and to fix the nitrogen-oxygen compounds formed (Norton, p. 95, and British Patent 8653 of 1907). According to a modified method carried out by means of a gas producer, the gas is burnt imme-diately above the fuel bed by supplying oxygen, or a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen, which may be intro-duced so as to come into contact with the top layer of the fuel and thus augment its temperature of com-combustion. The quantity of oxygen supplied must be sufficient to provide a &quot; surplus of from 10 to 20 per cent, of free oxygen&quot; in the combustion gases, while the combustion itself should be regulated so that the gases contain &quot; about 20 to 40 per cent, of carbonic acid.&quot; In order to prevent the decomposition of the nitric oxide, the gases are cooled by means of pipes which contain a cooling medium and are so arranged that the condensed moisture does not return to the reaction zone. It is stated that from 15 to 20 most. of nitric oxide per litre of gas can be obtained in this manner (British Patent 18203 of 1909), corresponding to a concentration of approximately 1 to 1 - 4 per cent, by volume of nitric oxide. Bender claims that with his latest furnace he is able, when using a mixtureof air and oxygen, to produce a gas containing 2-2 per cent, of nitric oxide (Norton, p. 96).Another type of apparatus proposed by Bender consists of a furnace provided with a set of long tubular burners, practically Bunsen burners, supplied with gaseous fuel which is burnt under pressure. A current of heated air is cirevdated around the burner tubes, and serves to augment the temperature of the flames at their upper ends (Norton, p. 95).Reference may also be made to a method proposed by the Badische Co. for obtaining oxides of nitrogen and nitric acid by the combustion of carbon monoxide, under pressures ranging from 15 to 30 atmospheres, in the presence of oxygen and nitrogen. By using a long thin flame and avoiding the presence of free or combined hydrogen it is stated that relatively large quantities of oxides of nitrogen are formed, and that liquid or solid nitrogen tetroxide can be separated by passing the products through a condenser before the pressure is released. It is also stated that con-centrated nitric -acid can be condensed from the products of combustion if water vapour, hydrogen, or a combustible containing hydrogen is added to the carbon monoxide. The total quantity of water vapour ultimately present should not be more than is necessary for converting the oxides of nitrogen into concentrated nitric acid (British Patent 20406 of 1908).According to other information, it has been found by Haber that, when the combustion is carried out under a pressure of 8 or 9 atmospheres with heated air, 3 or 4 molecules of nitric oxide are obtained for every 100 molcules of carbon monoxide consumed, the yield being doubled if a mixture containing equal volumes of oxygen and nitrogen is employed in place of air (Norton, p. 94). &quot;When hydrogen is burnt in air under pressure, the yield of nitric oxide is stated to amount to 3 volumes for every 100 volumes of hydrogen consumed. Upon the basis of the above figures, the possibility of utilising cheap gaseous fuels, such as water-gas, which are rich in carbon monoxide and hydrogen, is thus foreshadowed (Norton, p. 95).Thermal Considerations.In order to form an estimate of the possibilities of combustion processes, it is necessary to consider briefly the nature of the results that might be obtained under the best conditions at different working tem-peratures.Dealing in the first place with the formation of nitric oxide at elevated temperatures, the table given below indicates the maximum concentrations of nitric oxide obtainable at temperatures ranging from l,500o to 3,000o C. The figures in the table have been calculated from Nemsfs experimental value for the thermal equilibrium concentration of nitric oxide in air at ordinary pressure and at a temperature of 2,200o absolute, namely, 0 - 99 per cent, by volume.	Equilibrium ConcentrationTemperature, 0C.	of NO	Per Cent, by volume.1,500	0311,000	0-421,700	0-591,800	0-731,900	0-932,000	1-152,100	1-402,200	.    1-672,300	1-972,100	2-302,500	2-652,600	3-022.700	3-422,800	3-832,900	4-253,000	4-68
It will be seen that the value of the equilibrium concentration shows a progressive rate of increase for each increment in temperature, the value at 2,4000 0., for example, being double that- at 2,000o 0. It is apparent, therefore, that any expedient capable of augmenting the temperature of combustion in these upper regions, even by one or two hundred degrees, will have an important influence upon the ultimate con-centration of nitric oxide in the burnt products.The general conditions of temperature in the operation of combustion processes are of a less deter-terminate character than those of an explosion process. It is known, however, that flame temperatures of the order of l,800o 0. can be obtained in the combustion of coal gas in Bunsen burners under atmospheric conditions, while values of 2,300o 0. or higher are attained in the oxy-acetylene flame. By employing fuel gases of high calorific value in conjunction with recuperative heating of the gaseous mixture to be burnt or with pre-heated air or oxygen, as has been proposed, it seems probable, apart from the limitations indicated below, that temperatures comparable with those of the Hausser process and even of the arc process could be attained, especially if the combustion is effected under pressure. It does not necessarily follow, however, that the whole of the free oxygen and nitrogen circulated through or in contact with the zone of combustion could be raised to the maximum temperature of the flame, and that the corresponding thermal equilibrium concentration of nitric oxide could therefore be obtained. Moreover, the percentage of nitric oxide actually formed will be lower than that obtained with pure air, as in the arc process, on account of the effect of the inert products of com-combustion in diminishing the partial pressures of the oxygen and nitrogen,An important factor governing the maximum tem-peratures attainable in practice is the question as to the availability of materials capable of withstanding the severe conditions imposed by the continuous operation of combustion processes at augmented temperatures. Although the materials themselves would not attain the maximum flame temperatures, the degree to which the gases would have to be heated in order to secure commercial yields of nitric oxide would probably neces-sitate the employment of the most refractory of known materials for lining the apparatus, such as pure lime, high-grade zirconia, or carborundum. Having regard also to the temperatures which the most resistant of metals are capable of withstanding in continuous use, there are limitations to the employment, as has been proposed, of metal tubes for recuperative heating.Dealing next with the influence of dissociation, it may be recalled that in the case of the Birkeland-Eyde process the furnace gases only contain about 1&apos;25 per cent, of nitric oxide (Section III.), although the tem-pcrature of the arc is stated to be over 3,OOO0 0. (Norton, p. 51), corresponding co a thermal equilibrium concentration of at least 4 - 7 per cent. According to the evidence given in connection with the Hausser process (Section IX.), the exhaust gases contain from 0&apos; 3 to 0 - 6 per cent, of nitric oxide, whereas, if explo-sion temperatures of the order of 2,000o to 2,500o 0. are assumed, the corresponding equilibrium concen-trations for air would be from 1 -15 to 2 - 65 per cent.The problem of effecting the rapid cooling of large volumes of gas heated to an elevated temperature presents technical difficulties, as previously mentioned in connection with the arc process (Section III.), and it appears unlikely that the expedients proposed by Bender would be as effective as the sudden expansion of the hot gases characteristic of the Hausser process.In view of the considerations presented above, there are primd facie reasons for doubting whether a com-combustion process, even if coupled with efficient cooling of the gaseous products, could be relied upon to give a concentration as high as that claimed by Bender, namely, 2-2 per cent, of nitric oxide.Yield ol Combined Nitrogen in terms of Fuel consumed.It has been stated 1 (Norton, p. 96) that when the Bender process is carried out in a gas producer in the manner previously described, a kilogramme of nitric acid is obtained by the consumption of 42 kg. of coalhaving a calorific value of 7,000 cals. (12,600 B.Th.U. per lb.). Upon this basis, tho production of a metric ton of nitric acid involves the consumption of 42 metric tons of coal representing a total calorific value of 294,000,000 kg. cals., or approximately 1,166,700,000 B.Th.U.In the case of the Hausser process, a yield of 135 gms. of HNO;i per cu. m. of coke-oven gas having a calorific value of 4,000 kg. cals. per cu. m. (450 B.Th,U. per cu. ft.) represents the utilisation of 29,660,000 kg. cals., or 117,700,000 B.TLU. per metric ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) obtained (Section IX.), equivalent to 4-2 tons of coal (calorific value 12,500 B.Th.U. per lb.). The Bender process according to the above figures involves the consump-tion of about 10 times the amount of fuel needed by the Hausser process for obtaining an equal output of nitric acid.It is interesting to compare the above figures with the corresponding fuel requirements of the arc process if the latter were operated in connection with a large steam turbo-electric power station of, say, 100,000 k.w, maximum demand. Taking the fuel consumption o  the power station at 20,000 B.TLU. per k.w.-hour, or 6-25 tons of coal (calorific value 12,500 B.TI1.U. per lb.) per k.w.-year of 8,760 hours, the amount of coal consumed in the production of a metric ton of HNO;i (calculated as 100 per cent.) would amount to 1-87 X 6-25 = 11-7 long tons. This figure also shows to marked advantage in relation to that quoted for the Bender process.No evidence is available to the Sub-Committee as to the consumption of gaseous fuel per unit of corn-bin ed nitrogen recovered when the Bender process is carried out with a furnace and tubular burners of the kind previously described.   The figures quoted for the yield of nitric oxide by the combustion of carbon monoxide and hydrogen may, however, be briefly con-sidered in connection with the possible utilisation of water-gas.   Taking an average &quot; blue &quot; water-gas as consisting of 50 per cent, by volume of hydrogen and 40 per cent, by volume of carbon monoxide, and assuming a yield of three volumes of nitric oxide for every 100 volumes of hydrogen or carbon monoxide burnt, the combustion of 1,000 cu. ft. of water-gas would result in the production of 27 cu. ft. or 1,024 gins, of nitric oxide, equivalent to about 2,150 gms. of HNO:) if losses in the recovery operations are neglected.  The fuel requirements of the water-gas plant may be taken at 49 lb. of coke per 1,000 cu. ft. of water-gas (Section XV.).  Upon the basis of the above figures, the production of a metric ton of HN03 would thus involve the consumption of 1,000 x 49 2-15^ 22,790 lb., or over 10 tons of coke. The yield of nitric acid per cu. m. of water-gas burnt would be approximately 76 gms., as compared with the figure of 135 gms. per cu. m, of coke-oven gas provisionally adopted in the case of the Hausser process. When account is taken of the nett calorific values of the two gases, namely 290 B.Th.U. per cu. ft. in the case of &quot;blue &quot; water-gas, and 450 B.Th.U. per cu. ft. in the case of coke-oven gas, the production of a metric ton of HNO;j by the combustion method and by the Hausser process corresponds to the utilisation of approximately 135,000,000 B.TI1.U. and 117,700,000 B.Th.U. respectively.   From the point of view of the thermal units consumed for a given yield, the two processes are thus about on a parity.SEMI-INDUSTRIAL OPERATIONS.The Bender process appears to have owed its appli-cation on a practical scale to the chance discovery in 1909 of a jet of natural gas at Kissarmas, in Tran-sylvania, during the course of investigations concerned with deposits of potassium salts. The jet was obtained from a bore-bole 300 m. in depth, and took nearly two years to get under control, the daily output amounting to 1,000,000 cu. m. (35,000,000 cu. ft.), and consisting of practically pure methane, the composition being as follows : Crl4, 99 per cent., H2, 0-4 per cent., 02, and N2, 0-6 per cent. (Matignon, Bulletin de la Societe d&apos;Encouragement pour Vlndustrie Rationale, 1913, Vol. 119, No. 6, pp. 813-814).A provisional concession of 200,000 cu. m. of gas per day was granted by the Hungarian Government
to a company formed for exploiting the Bender process and was subsequently made definite after it had been demonstrated at a small trial plant, in which the gas was burnt under pressure in burners of the Bunsen type, that tho process was workable. A factory was in course of erection in 1913 for utilising the whole of the gas granted under the concession for the manu-facfcure of nitric acid, but no information is available as to whether the enterprise was a commercial success.Assuming that the yield of nitric acid per ou. m. of natural gas amounted to the figure provisionally adopted for the Hausser process when using a coke-oven gas of average calorific value, namely, 135 gms. of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) per cu. m., the production of nitric acid from 200,000 cu. m. of natural gas per day would amount to about 9,450 metric tons per year of 50 weeks, equivalent to about 15,800 metric tons of lime nitrate (13 per cent, N) (Section III.).OBSERVATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS.In spite of the attractions possessed by processes offering the possibility of effecting the direct oxida-tion of atmospheric nitrogen by the combustion of fuel, relatively little progress appears to have been made in their technical development. This is doubt-less attributable both to the considerable practical difficulties that have to be overcome, and also to the limitations imposed by the character of the processes themselves.In the first place, it is necessary to heat very large volumes of air to an elevated temperature in order to oxidise a very small percentage of the nitrogen present, and the thermal requirements for this opera-tion are of considerable magnitude even when the heat is applied as effectively as by the electric arc (Section III). When the heat is applied in a less effective manner, as by the combustion of gaseous fuels, the thermal requirements are still larger, while products of combustion such as water vapour and carbon dioxide act as diluents and lower the equilibrium concentration of nitric oxide. If the figure previously quoted, namely, 42 tons of coal per ton of nitric acid recovered, can be taken as an index of the magnitude of the fuel requirements of the Bender process, the prospect of it being developed as a competitor of fixation processes , involving the generation of electrical energy from coal would appear to be remote. Even the figures deduced in the case of the utilisation of water-gas show little margin as compared with the requirements of the arc process which demands a far larger consumption of electrical energy than any other established nitrogen fixation process.In the next place, the chemical and physical limitations previously discussed render it doubtful whether combustion processes could in practice be made superior to the arc process or even the Hausser process as regards the concentration of nitric oxide in the gaseous products. The additional handicap of large and costly absorption tower plant has thus to be faced as long as the efficient recovery of small percentages of nitric oxide from large volumes of gases is dependent upon the methods at present in use.In the last place it may be noted that the demand for nitric acid under normal conditions is compara-tively limited, and that the costs involved in converting the acid into a solid nitrate salt packed for the market are substantial (Section III). Unless, there-fore, it can be established that combustion processes offer a prospect of competing on equal terms with other methods of producing synthetic nitric acid, there would not be a strong inducement for their industrial development.It is apparent from the available evidence that the processes in their present stage can hardly be regarded as serious factors in the problem of fixing atmo-spheric nitrogen. The introduction of a successful combustion process, however, would have an important bearing upon nitrogen fixation in countries possessing large supplies of coal or where natural methane.gas is available, as in certain districts in Canada.      -,rr,
91 appendix V. : PEAT. 301       ^SECTION XIII.NITROGEN RECOVERY FROM PEAT.The magnitude of the problem of the recovery of nitrogen from peat may bo measured by tho fact that the estimated quantity of raw peat in the United Kingdom alone is not less than 5,000 million tons calculated as free from moisture.The average nitrogen content of dry peat may he taken at about 1- 5 per cent., although in the case of some bogs the figure is as high as 2 &quot;5 to 3 per cent. It has been claimed that as much as 85 per cent, of the nitrogen contained in peat is recoverable as ammonia by gasifying the material in producers, and there is evidence to show that a figure of 70 per cent, and over has been attained in commercial practice. Upon the latter basis, and assuming an average, nitrogen content of l-5 per cent., the deposits in the United Kingdom represent a potential source of upwards of 50 million tons of nitrogen, equivalent to over 250 million tons of ammonium sulphate.The chief difficulty in all schemes for utilising peat for nitrogen recovery or for the production of fuel resides in the fact that - the raw material usually contains from 85 to 92 per cent, of water. When once the moisture content has been reduced to a suitable amount, the gasification of peat in pro-ducers for the recovery of ammonia is a straight-forward process. The crux of the problem lies in the provision of a method, independent of climatic con-ditions and capable of continuous operation for large-scale working, whereby the necessary reduction in the moisture content can be effected at a cost which will not render the whole process uneconomical.general characteristics of peat.The term peat is often applied to two very different substances, namely:  .  (a) True peat, such as is found in moorlands.This substance is acid in nature and com-monly occurs in districts of high rainfall and low temperature. (b) Fen, which is neutral in nature and occurs more locally, in, this country mainly in the eastern counties.Peat consists of more or less decomposed vege-table matter, together with mineral substances such as soil, clay, etc. The vegetable matter consists mainly of the fibres and remains of various mosses and plants, and, as already indicated, holds a very considerable quantity of water.Some doubt appears to exist as to whether the water is mechanically retained in the cellular tissues, or whether it is held by the peat in a chemically combined state. It is clearly established, however, that the bulk of the water cannot be removed from raw peat by a filtration process involving pressure alone. This characteristic of peat has been attributed by Ekenberg to the presence of large quantities of a colloidal or gelatinous substance, which he termed &quot; hydrocellulose,&quot; possessing the property of absorbing large quantities of water and of retaining it. with great tenacity. The older and more decomposed peat contains the greater percentage of &quot;hydrocellulose,&quot; and the substance thus occurs to an increasing extent in passing from the upper to the lower layers of a bog. The older black peat has a slimy feel, and a micro-scopic examination of the slime itself reveals distinct cellular structure although no trace of fibrous or vegetable structure is visible to the unaided eye.A certain amount of water, termed surface water, can be removed from raw peat by drainage, but the average moisture content is seldom reduced below SS per cent, by this means even in the case of the most thoroughly drained bogs. (Peat, Lignite, and Coal, Department of Mines, Canada, 1914, No. 299, p. 9.) The amount of water capable of being removed from rawU  6019peat by pressure alone varies with the character of the peat, In the case of the most recently formed brown fibrous peats, the moisture content has been reduced by pressure to about 70 per cent., and this appears to be the lowest figure attained. It corre-sponds to the removal of about 74 per cent, of the total moisture in the raw material. In the case, how-ever, of the older black peats, the moisture content is usually incapable of reduction below 80 to 85 per cent, by the application of pressure alone, i.e., only about 37 to 55 per cent, of the original moisture can be removed in this way.The mineral substances associated with peat reduce its value from the point of view of fuel production and also of nitrogen recovery. Quantitatively, the mineral substances are estimated as &quot; ash &quot; in the dried product, and in the case of European peats, analyses have shown that the ash varies from I per cent, to 25 per cent., with an average of about 5 por cent. (Bidletin, Imperial Institute, 1907, Vol. V., No. 3, p. 251).thermal considerations.Peat is a fuel of a comparatively low grade, the calorific value varying from about 7,500 to 9,500 B.Th.U. per lb. of the theoretically dry product, as compared with 11,500 to 13,500 B.Th.U. per lb in the case of coal.In dealing with the problem of gasifying peat in producers for ammonia recovery, it must be remembered that the moisture content of the material has not only to be heated and evaporated but also superheated to the temperature of the exit gases.The following calculated values indicate the amount of heat required for these purposes and also the surplus heat available per lb. of peat gasified, neglecting losses due to radiation, etc. The calorific value of the peat is assumed to be 9,500 B.TI1.U. per lb. of theoretically dry product, and the temperature of the exit gases is taken to be, 600o E. (3150 C.) (Peat, Lignite and Coal, pp. 53 and 54).Moisture Content of Peat. Per cent.	P..Th.U. for Heating, Evaporating, and Superheating Moisture.

It follows, therefore, that the moisture content of the peat originally handled must be reduced to a value at which the surplus calorific power is sufficient not only for steam-raising and for drying the peat prior to gasification, but also to provide for losses. Taking, as before, the case of peat having a calorific value of 9,500 B.Th.U. per lb. calculated as anhydrous, and allowing only for the heat required to evaporate and superheat the moisture content, the following theoretical figures indicate the percentage of dry peat that would be available foru
steam-raising and other plant requirements, and for external use.Moisture Content of Peat at, producers. Per cent,	Proportion of Dry Peat used for heating, evaporating, and superheating moisture.

According to standard recovery producer practice, the nett steam requirements amount to 1 - 5 lb. per lb. of coal. In the case of peat, the nett amount of steam to be supplied would thus amount to 1 lb. per lb. of theoretically dry peat, or 0-65 lb. for a peat fuel containing 35 per cent, of moisture.It has been found in practice that under favourable conditions from 40 per cent, to 60 per cent, of the calorific power of the peat gasified is sufficient for steam-raising and for partially drying the whole of the peat prior to gasification. In such cases it is clear from the theoretical figures given above, that a plant operated solely for ammonia recovery cannot be self-supporting from the thermal point of view unless the moisture content of the peat at the stage at which the application of heat becomes necessary is below 80 per cent.Permissible Moisture Content for Gasification.A balance sheet of the heat quantities actually involved indicates that it should be possible to gasify peat containing 60 per cent, of moisture, and there is evidence to show that this has been accomplished.In this connection reference may be made to the Frank &amp; Oaro process, in which the gasification is carried out by the aid of air and steam in such a way that the &quot; total organic matter&quot; of the peat is con-verted into heating gas. It has been claimed that peat containing up to 60 per cent, of water can be utilised by this process and that the process can be worked all the year round as peat of the character mentioned can be obtained by spontaneous drying practically throughout the year. It has also been stated that the process, in addition to yielding a power gas of good calorific value, enables 85 per cent, of the nitrogen in the peat to be recovered in the form of ammonia, since &quot; the organic nitrogen of fresh peat is &quot; completely transformed by steam into ammonia &quot; whilst this is not the case with dry peat&quot; (Lunge, Coal Tar and Ammonia, 1916, Part 3, pp. 1179 and 1180).From the information available concerning the commercial operations of this process, it has been deduced that, under the most favourable conditions, the quantity of heat generated by the gasification of peat containing 60 per cent, of moisture is insufficient to effect the various reactions, to provide for losses, and at the same time to give a power gas of the heating value claimed (Peat, Lignite and Coal, pp. 131 and 134). vIt appears that peat containing 50 per cent, of moisture makes a good fuel for gas producers, and information available to the Sub-Committee indicates that peat of this quality has been successfully used for ammonia recovery. If, however, the surplus power gas resulting from the process is to be employed for gas engines or for firing, boilers, it is desirable that the moisture content should be reduced to about 35 percent, to 40 per cent, before the peat is charged into the producers. It is worthy of note that in the case of two successful commercial installations in Italy, every effort is made to keep the moisture content of the peat as fired to a figure of 32 to 35 per cent., as this has been found to result in the most efficient working, the maximum recovery of ammonia, and the product tion of the best power gas which has a calorific value of from 155 to 160 B.Th.U. per cu. ft.The information available indicates, therefore, that the utilisation of peat for the recovery of ammonia, as distinct from its utilisation for the production of a solid fuel, does not necessitate the reduction of the moisture content of the raw material beyond about 35 to 50 per cent.The gasification of such a material for nitrogen recovery will thus result in the production of surplus gas available for power purposes after the require-ments of the drying and gasification processes have been met, as will be apparent from the figures pre-viously given.METHODS OF REDUCING MOISTURE CONTENT.The crux of the peat problem resides in the eco-nomical reduction of the moisture content of the raw material to values of the order indicated above. A brief account is therefore necessary of the principal methods hitherto employed or proposed for rendering raw peat suitable for use as a domestic fuel or for gasification in producers.In dealing with the various methods, it is important to appreciate the results that are implied by figures specifying the extent to which the moisture content has been reduced from its original value. The follow-ing figures are therefore given in order to illustrate the relation between the percentage moisture content at any stage and the percentage reduction of the total moisture originally present in the raw peat, which has been taken as 90 per cent.Moisture Content reduced from 90 per cent, to	Percentage of original moisture removed.85	37-0SO	5$S575	66-070	74-065	79-360	83-355	86-450	88-845	90-940	92-6It will be seen from these figures that the pre-liminai-y stages in reducing the moisture content will result in the removal of a much larger proportion of the original moisture than the later stages. In these circumstances, it is clear that the introduction of an economical method of effecting the first stages would have an important influence upon the whole problem of drying peat.Natural Air-drying.The only method hitherto found economical for drying peat on a large scale is that adopted in many countries for the preparation of a peat fuel, namely, natural air-drying. Although large quantities of peat fuel are produced in this way, the practice is seasonal and is not found capable of operation throughout the year owing to its dependence upon climatic conditions.The main factors governing the open air-drying of peat are the percentage humidity of the atmosphere and the influence of wind, rain, and sun, their relative order of importance being approximately as stated. It should also be noted that peat usually occurs in districts where the rainfall is high.When peat is cut and stacked in such a way that there is free access of air, the moisture content can be reduced to about 25 or 30 per cent, in the course of six or eight weeks depending upon the atmospheric conditions.   The season during which peat can be
APPENDIX V. : PEAT.30.Hdried in the open, however, is comparatively short, ranging from 95 to 120 days, practically no drying being possible in the late autumn, winter, and early spring.   .In considering the applicability of air-drying to large-scale nitrogen recovery operations carried out continuously throughout the year, regard must be had to the fact that the method involves considerable labour and the handling of large quantities of raw peat. It also involves the provision of a very con-siderable space for the drying operations owing to the time required by the process and to the necessity for providing free access of air to the stacked peat.The bearing of the latter point upon the question of drying space may be illustrated by the following approximate figures dealing with the volume of air under ordinary atmospheric conditions necessary for reducing the moisture content of raw peat (90 per cent, water) to a value of, say, 50 per cent., so as to render the peat suitable for direct use in producers. The drying of the peat to the extent indicated represents the removal of about 90 per cent, of the total water originally present in the raw materialAccording to the records over a period of eight years at a station in the Midlands in this country, where the conditions would probably be more favour-able to air-drying than those prevailing in the majority of peat districts in the United Kingdom, the mean temperature of the air in winter (January) is 38- 40 F. and in summer (July) 60 *20 F., the corresponding mean relative humidities being 88 per cent, and 74 per cent.The quantity of aqueous vapour in a cubic foot of saturated air amounts to 2-69 grains at 38- 40 F. and to 5-78 grains at 60-20 F. From the above figures it appears that the moisture removed from one ton of raw peat (90 per cent, water) in obtaining a producer fuel containing 50 per cent, of water is sufficient to bring to saturation about 40,000,000 cu. ft. of air under winter conditions, and over 8,000,000 cu. ft. under summer conditions, without making any allow-ance for the fall in temperature of the air due to the evaporation of the moisture, for the consequent raising of the relative humidity and for the loss in the drying power of the air.In this connection it should be noted that the fuel requirements of a continuously - operating nitrogen recovery plant of even a moderate scale would involve the evaporation of very large quantities of water per day. In the case, for example, of an ammonium sul-phate factory operating at a bog containing 115 per cent, of nitrogen, and. having an output of about 5,000 tons of sulphate per annum, about 2,160 tons of water would have to be evaporated daily from 2,700 tons of raw peat (90 per cent, water) in order to provide about 540 tons of peat fuel (50 per cent, water) for the producer plant.In view of the impracticability of maintaining open air-drying on a large scale in this country during the winter, the operations of obtaining and drying the peat would have to be carried on in such a manner as to provide during the summer months for the total annual requirements of a nitrogen recovery plant. This would necessitate the provision of storage space for a sufficient reserve of fuel to enable the plant to be supplied during periods when the weather conditions rendered drying operations impossible, and the approximate scale of the storage arrangements can be gathered from the figures just given.The problem of maintaining an adequate reserve of fuel of the proper quality is complicated by certain characteristics of air-dried peat. When peat is in-sufficiently air-dry, it absorbs moisture with avidity up to the amount of the original moisture content of the raw material, and if this occurs the drying has to be started over again. Peat is also liable to become frozen, and when in this condition, the material is quite unsuitable for burning under boilers. On the other hand, if peat is sufficiently air-dry it does not absorb moisture aud is also immune from cold weather and does not become frozen (Peat, Lignite and Coal, p. 173). On account of the above characteristics, precautions have to be taken in stacking and pro-tecting the peat on the field, especially in the case of the peat obtained towards the end of the workingseason when the conditions have become less favourable for atmospheric drying.The above observations, when considered in tho light of the climatic conditions prevailing in tho peat districts of the United Kingdom, make it apparent that it would be commercially impracticable to rely upon natural air-drying alono for providing the fuel require-meats of a large scale continuously-operating nitrogen recovery installation.The Wiesmoor power installation in Germany pro-vides an interesting example of a continuously-working plant of moderate capacity depending upon air-dried peat obtained during a portion of the year only, namely, between April and August. The chief difficulties encountered were concerned with the problem of ensuring the availability of an adequate reserve of peat fuel sufficiently dry for immediate use. For example, the reserve immediately available in January 1910 amounted to 6,000 tons, while a further quantity of 6,000 tons of insufficiently dry peat was expected to be available in May. In consequence of unexpected demands upon the power plant and of the increased daily consumption of fuel, the immediate reserve was only sufficient to last until the end of March. It became necessary, therefore, to employ lignite briquettes as a supplementary fuel in order to main-tain the plant in operation at full load. At a later date it was found that the further reserve of 6,000 tons which was expected to be available in May had been almost completely ruined by frost. In conse-quence of this experience, large storage depots were erected and special transporting arrangements installed in order to render the conveyance of the peat to the plant independent of contingencies (Peat, Lignite and Coal, pp. 174-79).Artificial Drying by Hot Air or Waste Gases.The problem of drying raw peat by means of hot gases is much less complex than that of natural air-drying, but the application of the method is limited both by thermal and by economic considerations. It has already been shown that a plant operated solely for ammonia recovery cannot be self-supporting from the thermal point of view unless the moisture content of the peat at the stage at which the application of heat becomes necessary is of the order of 80 per cent, or less. Natural peat of this quality is not of frequent occurrence, and as a general rule the material would require preliminary treatment, such as by natural air-drying, to render it suitable for further drying by means of hot gases. From the economic point of view, schemes combining power production with nitrogen recovery offer better prospects than nitrogen recovery schemes alone. It follows, therefore, that the calorific power expended in drying the peat must be kept as low as possible in order to leave a greater surplus available for power production. For such schemes it is thus obviously necessary to effect as large a preliminary reduction in the moisture content as possible in order to permit of economy in drying by hot gases.Artificial drying by means of a mixture of air and hot gases is relied upon at two successful installations of moderate capacity in Italy, namely at Oodigoro and at Orentano. The waste gases from the plants and a certain proportion of power gas are utilised for the pur-pose, the mixture being forced through special drying sheds containing trays of peat. At Orentano the raw peat has a moisture content of about 77 per cent, which is reduced to about 30 to 35 per cent, by the drying operation. The hot gases are used at a temperature of about 1503 C, and the plant deals daily with about 30 tons of peat calculated as anhydrous. The plant at Oodigoro has the advantage of operating at a carefully drained bog where the moisture content of the crude peat is as low as about 58 per cent. The hot gases enter the drying sheds at a temperature of about 110o to 1200 0. and leave at a temperature at which the exit gases are below full saturation. The moisture content of the peat is reduced to about 33 per cent., and the drying sheds, which cover an area of 2,000 sq. metres (about 2,400 sq. yds.), have a daily capacity of 200 tons of peat calculated as anhydrous.
Methods of drying involving tho preliminary reduction of the moisture content and tho subsequent use of hot gases arc dealt with below.Filtration under Pressure.Many attempts have been made to improve the economy of peat&apos; drying processes by resorting to mechanical filtration raider pressure for carrying out the preliminary stages during which the bulk of the moisture is removed.Having regard to the previous remarks concerning both the variations in the composition ,o  the different layers of bog and also the extent to which the moisture in various kinds of peat can be reduced by pressure alone, it is apparent that any method of reducing the moisture content must, in order to be of general application, be capable of dealing with the most difficult varieties of peat. Any such method should obviously comprise, as a preliminary stage, means for rendering the raw material amenable to the process of filtration under pressure.The wet-carbonising process devised by Ekenborg and Larson utilises the conjoint action of heat and pressure. The raw masticated peat, containing about 90 per- cent, of moisture, is heated to a temperature of about 180oC. under a pressure of from 25 to 30 atmospheres, with the result that decomposition begins, and the peat is partly carbonised. The material ia then passed through a filter press, the amount of - moisture removed depending upon tire pressure employed, Operations carried out on a fairly large scale have shown that the application of a pressure of about 6 atmospheres results in a reduction of the moisture content to about 65 to 70 per cent., i.e., in the removal of about 74 to 80 per cent, of the total moisture originally contained in the peat. A more detailed account *6f the process is given later in this section, together with an estimate of the costs involved in its operation.According to another process devised by Buckle, the raw peat, after pulping, is heated to a temperature of at least 100o C. under sufficient pressure to prevent the formation of steam, and then submitted to the action of an electric current. It is said that the con-sumption of electrical energy is equivalent to &quot; about 50 0. of heating power,&quot; and that the total require-ments of the combined operations are equivalent to &quot;about 105o to 110o 0. of heating power.&quot; During the demonstration of an experimental plant in the presence of officers of the Munitions Inventions Depart-ment, the electrical treatment was effected by the use of a direct current of 10 amps, at a pressure of 20 volts. The patent specification describing the process states that either continuous or alternating current may be employed, preferably the former, and the preferred voltage is stated to be 200 volts. The treatment is followed by the subsequent application of pressure in a filter press, and it is stated that the moisture content can be reduced by this process to about 66 per cent. It is further stated that the material, when removed from the filter press and allowed to cool, loses another 5 per cent, of moisture, and that if the material is then broken up and subjected to hydraulic pressure for about an hour, the moisture content is reduced to 50 per cent.The electrical conductivity of peat presumably de-pends upon the nature and amount of the mineral matter present, and is thus liable to considerable variation. As a rule, high moor peats contain less mineral matter than low moor peats and fen, and would therefore appear to be less suitable for treatment by this process. In the case of high moor peats, for example, the chief mineral content, namely, lime, is present in smaller quantities than the nitrogen, whereas the quantities are approximately equal in the case of low moor peats : and fen. According to the evidence available, the electrical treatment, when applied to low moor peat or fen, appears to render the material amenable to filtra-tion under pressure, but has not hitherto succeeded in doing so in the case of high moor rieats. The process has not yet been subjected to an extended trial on a commercial scale, but an estimate as to the economic possibilities of the process is dealt with later in the section.According to another method, which is based upon a patent by Franke, the raw masticated peat, con-tainrng about 90 per cent, of moisture, is subjected to pressure in the cold in an hydraulic press of special design provided with perforated drainage devices to allow egress of the expelled water. It is claimed that the moisture content itr reduced to about 75 per cent, during this stage. Steam is then admitted to heat the material to about 90o 0., the pressure being simultaneously continued and increased, and it has been stated that the moisture content can be reduced by this treatment to about 40 per cent., corresponding to the removal of about 92 per cent, of the original moisture. Tho claims made for this apparatus, however, have yet. to be substantiated on u large scale, and a commercial press is in course, of construction for this, purpose by the Power Gas Corporation, Limited.THE ECONOMICS OF PEAT PROCESSES.All processes for the utilisation of peat on. a large scale, whether for nitrogen recovery or for the pro-duction of a fuel, are hampered by the high moisture content of the crude material and the consequent high ratio between the amount of material handled and the amount of realised products.This point may be illustrated by a brief exami-uation of the requirements of an ammonia recovery factory having tho moderate output of, say, 1,000 tons of combined nitrogen or 5,000 tons of ammonium sul-phate per annum. Taking the moisture content of the raw peat at 90 per cent., the nitrogen content of the theoretically dry peat at 1&apos; 5 per cent., and a yield of 70 per cent, of the nitrogen in the producers, over 952,000 tons of raw peat would have to be treated per annum for an output of the scale mentioned above, or over 190 tons of raw peat per ton of sulphate obtained. Assuming that the moisture content is reduced to 50 per cent, prior to the gasification of the peat, cor-responding to the removal of nearly 90 per cent, of the original moisture, the annual requirements of the plant represent the removal of over 760,000 tons of water from the raw material, or over 150 tons of water per ton of sulphate obtained. The weight of a cubic yard of peat (90 per cent, water) may be roughly taken as 17 cwt., so that the annual requirements of the factory would necessitate the excavation or dredging of about 1,120,000 cu. yds, of peatbog.It is clear from the above figures that the handling and drying sections of even a moderate-sized ammonia recovery plant have to be of very large capacity and involve a substantial capital cost. It is also obvious that all possible labour-saving appliances must be re-sorted to and careful attention given to the most efficient utilisation of the calorific value of the peat and to other details, in order to ensure the economical operation of a process depending upon such a low-grade raw material.&quot;When operating for nitrogen recovery alone, an important factor is the uniformity of the nitrogen content throughout the peat bog, and any appreciable variation in this factor will have an important influence upon the economics of the process. Another item of some significance is the cost of sulphuric acid de-livered at the plant, and in this connection it may be noted that peat bogs are usually situated at some distance from an industrial centre, thus adding to the cost of transport.There appears to be only one commercial instal-lation, namely, that at Codigoro, in Italy, operating mainly for nitrogen recovery, and precise information is not available as to the lower limiting value of the nitrogen content of peat at which such operations can be carried out economically. It has been stated, bow-ever, that unless the nitrogen content amounts to 1*5 per cent, it is not profitable to work peat for by-product recovery (Peat, Lignite and Coal, pp. 195 and 251).In cases where nitrogen recovery is combined with the production of power gas it has been found neces-sary, in order to avoid the destruction of the ammonia, to employ more steam in the producer blast than is required for making power gas alone, so that the thermal efficiency of the plant is correspondingly sacrificed. Nevertheless, it appears that combined schemes of the kmd indicated offer better prospects than recovery
APPENDIXschemes alone, and this is particularly the case if the power section of the plant can be operated at a high annual load factor. In general, however, there are not many eleetro-chemioiil processes suitable for installation in proximity to a peat bog, and the power would have to be transmitted to a neighbouring centre with a consequent addition to the cost of the scheme.There exist but few examples of commercially suc-cessf ul schemes operating on a considerable scale and working continuously all the year round, Reference has already been made to schemes in Italy and in Germany and most of these combine power production with nitrogen recovery. The costs involved in their operation cannot bo regarded as of any general appli-ability in view of the important influence of local conditions in respect of the cost of labour and materials, the demand for power, and so on.The following account gives a brief indication of the working results of two successful installations in Italy.Codigoro Installation.This power gas and ammonia recovery installation operates at a bog having an area of 3,000 acres, the average thickness of the peat being 21 inches, and the average moisture content 58 per cent. The average nitrogen content of the dry peat is on the high side, amounting to 2&apos;35 per cent. Crude peat to the extent of 750 cu. m, per day is excavated, partly by hand and partly by machinery, and is mixed and partly pulverized in machines. The peat pulp is extruded on to wire gauze frames carried by tracks, which are run into drying sheds divided into galleries and covering an area of 2,000 sq. metres. Each truck carries 42 frames holding about two tons of wet peat and remains in the galleries until the moisture content of the peat is reduced to about 33 per cent. The drying is effected by a mixture of air and hot gases as described earlier in this section, the mixture being forced through the sheds by fans at the rate of about 130 cu. m. per second. The hot gases consist of the products of combustion from boilers fired with gas and tar and of gas purposely burnt for the drying operation, and the drying plant has a daily capacity of 200 tons of peat calculated as anhydrous. The installation comprises six working producers each capable of gasifying 30 tons of peat (33 per cent, water) per day. At a load of 150 tons per day, the producers yield 270,000 cu. m. of gas containing 40 per cent, of combustibles and having a calorific value (gross) of 1,432 kg. cals. per cu. m., or 160 B.Th.U. per cu. ft. The yield of ammonium sulphate amounts to 172 lb. per ton of dry peat.The amount of steam raised in boilers for the power plant and the sulphate evaporators is 6,000 kg. per hour, and the power generated on the site amounts to 7,000 k.w.-hours per day which serves the whole scheme, including sulphuric acid plant. The gas obtained from 60 tons of peat per day is utilised for the requirements of the plant, and a considerable pro-portion of the remaining gas is burnt to waste.Operating Costs.   The cost of obtaining, con-surveying, drying, and delivering the peat to the producers is stated to bo under 3 lire or 2s. (id. per ton of peat calculated as anhydrous, equivalent to 12-6d. per ton of raw peat (58 per cent, water). No other figures relating to the installation are available to the Sub-Committee.Orentano Installation.This installation operates at a bog having an area , of 1,482 acres, of which 494 are owned by the com-pany. The peat is in two layers separated by a belt of gravel- and clay, and has an average total thickness of about 5 ft. The nitrogen content reckoned on the dry peat is 15 per cent. The peat is excavated by manual labour, and a portion is machined and air-dried in the field. The larger portion, however, after being stacked is taken to the power plant, where it is mechanically treated and dried artificially as described earlier in this section. The drying is effected by the exhaust gases from the gas engine plant, by the boiler and chimney gases, and by burning a proportion of the power-gas from the producers, the moisturev.: PEAT. 305    37 5content of the poat being reduced from about 77 poi cent, to about 32 to 35 per cent.The plant comprises four producers capable of dealing with 70 tons of theoretically dry peat per day at the full load of the power plant. Notwithstanding the low labour charges, it has been found difficult to produce the required quantity of peat, and the plant is therefore operated much below its maximum capacity, dealing with about 30 tons of theoretically dry peat per day. The peat, as fired, contains about 32 to 35 per cent, of moisture, and 1*04 per cent, of nitrogen. The producers yield about 40,430 cu. ft. of gas per toe. of peat (33 &quot;5 per cent, water), the gas containing about 37 per cent, of combustibles, and having a calorific value (gross) of 1,380 kg. cals. per cu. m, or 155 B.Th.U. per cu, ft. About 63 per cent, of the gas is used for steam raising and drying, the remainder being avail-able for power production. About 70 per cent, of the nitrogen content of the peat is recovered as ammonia.Capital Cost. The capital cost of the installation, inclusive of a power transmission line to Pontedera, 10 miles distant, amounted to 800,000 lire, or about  31,000.Operating Costs. The cost of excavating a metric ton of peat on the basis of 30 per cent of moisture is said to be 2s. Gd., equivalent to about 9- od. per ton of raw peat (77 per cent, water).A summary of the operating costs of the installation is given below (Peat. Lignite, and Coal, pp. 108 and 109), allowances being made for stand-by losses for shutting down during 15 days per annum. The original figures are quoted in dollars, and have been converted on the basis of 5 dollars per  1 sterling.Annual, Charges.

As previously remarked, however, the power plant is worked considerably below its maximum capacity, and an improvement in this direc-tion would lead to a material reduction in the cost, provided the cost of the fuel remained unaltered.Other Processes.More detailed reference will now be made ,to two processes which have received considerable attention in this country, but have not hitherto been brought to the successful commercial stage, namely, the Wet-Carbonising process and the Buckle process.Wet-Carbonising Process.A serious effort has been made to establish this process on a fairly large scale near Dumfries in Scot-land, at a bog having the relatively low nitrogen content of about 1 per cent, reckoned on the dry peat. According to information supplied by the company operating the process, a very large sum has been expended in experimental and factory work, and over 300,000 tons of raw peat had been treated at the installation up to the time of shutting down in July 1915, which was occasioned by labour difficulties. The plant has been inspected by a member of the Com-mittee and by officers of the Munitions Inventions Department, and is characterised by a number of interesting engineering details embodying the results of much experiment.  In the absence of direct evidence
based upon the continuous operation of tho plant ovor an adequate period, it is not possible to form con-elusions as to the commercial soundness of the process, or as to whether various difficulties that are admitted to have been encountered have been successfullyovercome.The installation at Dumfries has a capacity of 5,000 tons of raw peat per day, and the excavating is elf ected by an electrically-driven bucket dredge floating on a large pontoon. A pulp mill upon the dredge macerates the peat after the removal of stones and roots by a mechanical device, and the pulp is pumped through a pipeline to the factory, traversing a system of concentric pipes in which it is pre-heated by the effluent from the filter presses and then by the hot carbonised peat. The pulp passes to the carboniser in which its temperature is raised by a steam-jacket to about 180o C. under pressure, and is then treated in filter presses at a pressure of 100 lb. per sq. in. The press cake contains about 70 per cent, of moisture, and part of the cake is utilised as indicated below. The remainder is broken up into a finely divided state, and subjected, to the drying action of hot exhaust gases, the moisture content being reduced to from 5 to 10 per cent. The dry material is then briquetted without any added binder and mixed with the undried press cake in the proportion of one part of briquette to two parts of press cake, thus giving a producer fuel having a moisture content of about 48 to 50 per cent.The plant comprises a battery of five producers of a type specially suitable for nitrogen recovery, and in practice about 70 per cent, of the nitrogen in the peat is obtained as ammonia. The other products of the operation consist of gas having a calorific rvalue of about 155 B.Th.U. per cu. ft. and tar amounting to about 6 per cent, of the dry press cake, Upon distilla-tion, the tar yields about 47 per cent, of crude oil and 47 per cent, of pitch. If the plant is run primarily for nitrogen recovery, about 5 to 10 per cent, of the calorific power of the peat treated is said to remain as surplus after all the requirements of the process in respect of heat and power have been met.The following figures have been put forward by the company in connection with the cost of operating the wet-carbonising process for nitrogen recovery. They are stated to be based upon data from the large-scale plant which has been at work, and are applied to the cases of peat bogs containing respectively 1- 5 per cent, and 2-5 per cent, of nitrogen reckoned on the dry material.Capital Cost. The pre-war capital cost of a fully equipped installation for dealing with 1,750,000 tons of raw peat (94 per cent, water) per annum is placed at  175,000. In the case of peat bogs having nitrogen contents of 1 - 5 per cent, and 2 - 5 per cent, respectively, the corresponding annual outputs of ammonium sul-phate would amount to approximately 5,500 tons and 9,100 tons, assuming the recovery of 70 per cent, of the nitrogen as ammonia.Operating Costs.--It is stated that according to observed results the operating costs per 100 tons of natural peat (94 per cent, water) amount to  1- 8 upon the basis of pre-war prices. This figure, which is equivalent to 4&apos; 32d. per ton of raw peat, covers the cost of handling, drying, gasification, and manufacture of by-products and includes labour, maintenance and renewals, stores, management, depreciation, and capital charges.The by-products obtainable from 100 metric tons of raw peat (94 per cent, of water) having a nitrogen content of 1&quot;5 per cent., or 2-5 per cent.calculated on the dry material, are given as follows : 1&apos; 5 per 2 - 5 per cent.

The most important factor in the above estimate is the cost of operation from the ex-cavating stage to the by-product stage, and this is placed at 4&apos;32cZ. per ton of raw peat (94 per cent, water), or 6s. per ton of peat calculated as anhydrous.Considering, first, the gasification and by-product recovery stage alone, reliable information has estab-lished the fact that the cost of gasifying coal in recovery producers amounts to about 3s. per ton, inclusive of charges for labour, repairs, renewals, stores, management and insurance. There is no prima facie reason for a reduced cost when operating with peat fuel, which is a more bulky material; on the other hand, there is evidence to indicate that the costs are somewhat higher. Upon the basis, therefore, of standard coal practice, the operating costs involved in gasifying peat containing 50 per cent, of moisture would be at least of the order of 3s. per ton of fuel, or 6s. per ton of peat calculated as anhydrous.The figure given in the estimate for the overall cost of the complete process thus appears to leave no margin for the cost of excavating, conveying and drying, the most vital factor in all peat processes. In this con-nection it may be recalled that the operating costs at Codigoro are stated to amount to 2s. Qd. per ton of anhydrous peat for excavating, obtaining, drying, and delivering to the producers. Although the labour costs in Italy are on the low side, the excavating at Codigoro is carried out partly by hand, whereas in the case of the wet-carbonising process, it is the practice to pump the pulp, which does not undergo any handling until the briquette stage is reached. It should be noted, moreover, that the company claims that their special knowledge concerning the pumping of peat, gained as the result of experiment and ex-perience, has enabled them to reduce the amount of labour required for handling raw peat below that needed for any other process. Nevertheless, the cost of excavating, conveying and drying cannot be negligence-gible even in the case of an automatic process carried out entirely by the aid of machinery. The cost of repairs of the machinery and pipe lines under the particular conditions of operation is also a factor of importance, and does not appear as yet to have been fully established.The only other item calling for special comment is the credit allowed for the sale of the fuel oils. The allowance is presumably based upon the proved value of the oils, but no definite information as to their value is available to the Sub-Committee.In summing up, it is clear that the precise cost of excavating and drying, including repairs, is a matter requiring substantiation by the continuous working of a large-scale installation over an adequate period of time. The figure practically determines the economics of the process as a whole, and a small margin of in-crease in the operating costs per ton of raw peat would make an appreciable difference in the estimated prospects of the process.   For the reasons previously
indicated, the figure put forward cannot he regarded as adecpiate.The Sub-Committee is informed by the War Do-partment that it has been decided to restore the Dumfries factory for the purpose of providing&apos;peat fuel briquettes for use in the trenches, and it is ex-pected that the output will begin in the summer of 1918. An opportunity of obtaining practical infor-mation as to the economics of the wet-carbonising process will thus be provided,Buckle Process.The special feature of this process, namely, the electrical treatment of peat prior to filtration under pressure, has already been referred to in dealing with methods of reducing the moisture content of peat.It is contemplated operating the process at a fen in Norfolk having an area of 6,000 acres, and estimated to contain 8,000,000 tons of surface peat calculated as free from moisture. The moisture content of the raw &apos; material amounts to about 85 per cent., and the nitrogen content of the dry peat is stated to be 2 1 39 per cent. It is estimated that at least 200 lb. of ammonium sulphate will be recovered per ton of dry peat in addition to tar amounting to about 6 per cent, of the dry peat, acetic acid, acetone, and other pro-diicts. The power gas obtainable per ton of dry peat is placed at 90,000 cu. ft. with a calorific value of 134 B.Th.U. per cu. ft. The total requirements of the process are stated to account for about 60,000 cu. ft. of the gas, leaving about 30,000 cu. ft. per ton of dry peat as a surplus for power purposes.The following estimate has been put forward in connection with the cost of operating the Buckle process.Capital Cost. The pre-war capital cost of a com-plete installation for dealing with 240 tons of dry peat per day and comprising excavating plant, Buckle process plant, electrical generating plant, producers, buildings, and accessories, is placed at about  115,000.The installation has a capacity equivalent to 560,000 tons of raw peat (85 per cent, water) per year of 50 weeks, and on the basis of a nitrogen content of 2&apos; 39 per cent, and a 70 per cent, recovery in the pro-ducers, the annual output of ammonium sulphate would be approximately 7,000 tons.Operating Costs.   The estimated working costs under pre-war conditions are given as follows :-Per ton Dry Peat.d.Excavating-, including labour, stores, and depreciation at 10 per cent. -     -     -   1   2Buckle process, including labour, stores, &amp;C, for generating plant, and depre-ciation at 10 per cent, on plant and 5 per cent, on buildings      -     -     -   2 10Producer and by-product section, inclu-ling labour, and depreciation at 10 per cent.   ---     -     -    -     -  1   ] Total    -     -     -     -  5   1JOn the basis of a yield of one ton of ammonium sulphate per 12 tons of dry peat and with sulphuric acid at  1- 5 per tou, the cost of a ton of unpacked sulphate after allowing for establishment charges is placed at  5.In this estimate the whole of the working expenses are charged against the sulphate, and no credit is taken for the other by-products or for the surplus power gas amounting to about one-third of the total output.Observations. The information available concerning the Buckle process is insufficient to enable the Sub-Committee to form a definite opinion as to its practical value. The following observations, however, may be made upon the costs quoted.The figure given in the estimate above for the cost of excavation is equivalent to about 2d. per ton of raw peat (85 per cent, water), which is con-siderably lower than any figure for the cost of excavating and conveying raw peat hitherto obtained in commercial working.   Moreover, the operating costs of the producer section of the installation per ton of dry peat are very substantially lower than those involved in standard producer practice when dealing with coal, and in the light of previous observations they must be regarded as altogether inadequate. The estimated cost of the electrical treatment stage, which apparently includes subsequent filtration under pres-sure, still remains to be proved, as the process had not yet been tried upon a commercial scale.Even if credit were taken for the other products such as tar, surplus power gas, etc, the economics of the process are so largely determined by the operating costs referred to above, that there would appear to bo little prospect of obtaining ammonium sulphate at the figure given in the estimate.THE PEAT PROBLEM IN IRELAND.Considerable attention has been given to the peat problem in Ireland on account of the extent of the deposits in that country. The problem of utilising -the peat on a large scale for nitrogen recovery or for other purposes is complicated, however, by the fact that the cutting of peat is, to a large extent, a right or appurtenance of tenants and tenant purchasers. The right of turbary is governed by many considerations, and by way of example it may be noted that a tenant may have the turbary within his own holding entirely to himself or subject to the rights of others, or may possess the right to cut on the holding of another tenant or on another bog in the possession of the land-lord. It will be apparent, therefore, that existing customs may render the development of large installa-tions a matter of some difficulty.Several attempts, however, have been made to conduct operations upon a substantial scale. For example, the Woltereck ammonia recovery process, involving the treatment of peat with air and steam at a carefully regulated temperature, was installed upon a commercial scale, but appears to have failed on account of the cost involved in reducing the moisture content of the peat by artificial drying. A small power gas plant, utilising peat apparently without by-product recovery, has for some years been in successful opera -tion at Portadown.An Irish Proposal.A detailed examination of the position in N.E. Ireland was made in 1906, with a view to the establish -ment of a nitrogen recovery and power gas installation at a bog haying an area of 4 sq. miles, and containing sufficient raw peat (85 per cent, water) to last for a period of about 50 years. The following particulars concerning the scheme have been supplied to the Sub-Committee.It was proposed to excavate the peat by dredgers, and to submit it to a preliminary air-drying. The peat was then to be conveyed through tunnels traversed by a counter-current of hot gases in order to reduce the moisture content to 35 per cent. The scheme provided for the dredging of 1,479 tons of raw peat per day, equivalent to about 340 tons of fuel contain-ing 35 per cent, of moisture. Of this quantity 150 tons were to be gasified per day, 11 tons burnt directly under boilers, and 100 tons to be further dried to a moisture content of 15 per cent, for sale as a domestic fuel. The power gas from 30 tons of the producer fuel was to be used for gas engine electric plant, that from 42 tons for boiler firing, and that from 4016 tons for the drying tunnels, the gas from the remaining 3714 tons being intended for sale for heating and power purposes.The nitrogen content of the dry peat approximated to 2 per cent., and as the result of actual trials it was considered that the amount of sulphate recoverable by the use of suitable producers would amount to 5 per cent, reckoned on the peat as fired.After a full investigation of all the local conditions, it was concluded that the results indicated below were possible by the employment of the most up-to-date methods and machinery.
Capital Cost. Tho estimated capital cost of installation was as follows:  Excavating and handling appliances,drying tunnels, wharves, &amp;e.  -     - 33,000Recovery producer plant : complete installation comprising 12 producers (2 spares) with all accessories and buildings       -     -     -     -     - 85,000Electric   generating   station: 8,000e.h.p. installed at  10 per e.h.p.     - 80,000Electric transmission lines and outsideelectrical equipment     -     -     - 40,000Gas main to neighbouring town -     - 25,000Contingencies and working capital    - 28,000Purchase oil bog at  15 per acre -     - 38,400Total  -     -  330,000Operating Costs.

The estimate as a whole is governed by particular local conditions, but the most important items may be briefly examinejd in ,the light of the evidence previously given.In the first place, it is interesting to note that the cost of excavating and delivering peat (35 per cent, water) by the most up-to-date methods and plant is placed at 3s. per ton, or 8-3d per ton of raw peat (85 per cent, water), apart from the small additional cost involved in working the drying tunnels. This figure is equivalent to about 4s. 7d. per ton of dry peat, and is somewhat lower than the costs quoted in respect of various installations abroad where machinery of different kinds is employed for excavating and handling peat.In the second place, the cost of gasification and ammonia recovery is placed at 4s. 6d. per ton of peat as fired (35 per cent, water), as compared with the -standard figure of about 3s. per ton in the case of the gasification of coal. This item is thus in accordance with ordinary producer practice.In general, the estimate may be taken as a, reason-able forecast of the possibilities of a particular pro-position, and  indicates that only a moderate profitwas to be expected. Having regard to the fact that about 40 per cent, of the annual revenue would have boon derived from the sale of ammonium sulphate at  11 per ton, it is clear that the economic position of the scheme would have been vitally dependent upon a sustained market value for this product,THE BACTERIAL UTILISATION OF PEAT.Under certain conditions peat provides a favourable medium for the growth and activity of nitrifying bacteria, and endeavours have been made.,to devise practical methods of utilising this characteristic. A brief account may therefore be given of the more important investigations upon this aspect of the peat problem.The researches of Miintz and Lainc in 1906 disclosed the possibility of intensifying the known conversion of ammonia nitrogen into nitrate nitrogen by treating peat with solutions of ammonium salts in the presence &apos; of sufficient lime to combine with the acids liberated, and at a temperature favourable for the activity of the nitrifying bacteria, namely, about 30o 0. In this way solutions containing 1 per cent, of lime nitrate were collected, a cubic metre of peat yielding 6-5 kg. of lime nitrate in 24 hours. It was found that only dilute solutions of ammonium salts were susceptible of quick nitrification, and that the activity of the bacteria was not affected by the presence of considerable quantities of nitrate in solution. By taking advantage of the latter point and repeatedly passing dilute solu-tions of ammonium sulphate through a thick bed of peat, solutions containing 22 per cent, of nitrate were easily secured (Norton, Utilisation of Atmospheric Nitrogen, .1912, pp. 44 and 45).The utilisation of a process of this character on an industrial scale would be hampered by many difficulties. In the first place, the process involves the excavation of peat, its transport to a factory, its treatment with large volumes of dilute ammoniacal solutions under carefully regulated conditions of temperature, the evaporation of large volumes of nitrate solution of moderate concentration, and the packing of the solid product for the market. It is obvious that the costs involved in these operations would be considerable (Sections III. and VII.).Another factor of importance in commercial working would be the time factor inherent in the nitrification process, since this would govern the output obtainable from a given installation. The determining factor, however, appears to be the relative market prices of ammonia nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen, and hitherto these prices have been substantially on a parity, Unless, therefore, the margin between the prices became sufficient to cover manufacturing costs, and this appears to be improbable, it is unlikely that the pi-ocess could ever be operated economically, except, perhaps, by the utilisation of waste ammoniacal liquors.Recent investigations of a different character have been carried out by Prof, Bottomley, and the following summary is based upon a statement furnished to the Department by him.The research has been directed to the production of a bacterised peat suitable for direct use as a fer-tiliser, since ordinary peat is not only useless for this purpose, but may even be harmful. It is claimed, however, that when raw peat is inoculated with certain aerobic bacteria, and incubated under suitable conditions, a large proportion of the humus is rendered soluble, and a non-acid, non-toxic substance produced which forms a suitable medium for the growth of nitrogen-fixing bacteria. It is further claimed that specific growth-promoting substances, analogous to the &quot;vitamines&quot; concerned in animal nutrition, are produced in all decaying organic matter, but in much larger quantities in bacterised peat than in any other source.According to the statement supplied, field ex-peidments with bacterised peat have yielded varying results, remarkable iucreases in crop growth in some cases, and no difference in others. Investigations into the causes of these variations revealed the fact that the presence or absence of phosphates, mineral nutrients in which peat is lacking, was the deter-mining factor.   Experiments were then made in the
laboratory In order to ascertain how far with advantage the necessary phosphate could ho incorporated with peat during tho bacterial treatment. It is stated that the experiments have shown that when raw peat is mixed with certain insoluble mineral phosphates, and then treated bacterially, some of the insoluble phos-phate is rendered water soluble, and, in addition, certain humo-phosphates are formed which are readily available as plant food.According to available evidence tiie field experi-ments hitherto made do not appear to have justified the claims put forward on behalf of bacterised peat (Journal, Board of Agriculture, April 1917, p. 11), and the problem of the bacterial utilisation of peat can only be regarded as in the early stages of develop-nient.GENERAL OBSERVATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS.From a review of the evidence available, it appears to be doubtful whether the utilisation of peat on a largo scale for nitrogen recovery and power production is likely to result &apos;n the production of ammonium sul-phate at the low costs sometimes put forward, or in the attainment of the high profits that have often been estimated.Cost of Recovering and Treating Raw Peat.In the first place, the enormous quantities of raw peat that have to be handled and dried to provide for the requirements of an ammonium sulphate factory of even a moderate capacity render it imperative that the handling and drying operations should bj carried out with, the utmost economy. The costs involved in these stages, including the cost of repairs, are the crucial items in all peat processes, and the difference between an economical process and an unsuccessful one may be accounted for by a comparatively small margin in the operating costs per ton of raw peat. From the ex-amples previously given it appears that the production of a ton of ammonium sulphate may involve the treat-ment of from 90 to 400 tons of raw peat (according tc its nitrogen and moisture content), and the removal of from G3 to 360 tons of water therefrom. Every in-crease or reduction of Id. per ton of raw peat in the cost of obtaining and drying will thus affect the pro-duction cost of ammonium sulphate to the extent of from  0- 375 to  1- 66 per ton.In this connection it may be useful to indicate the order of the costs involved in handling other classes of material in bulk. In the case, for example, of the carbide and cyanamide works at Odda, the cost of un-loading coal and limestone from ships by means of cranes having a lifting capacity of about 2 tons, and of transporting the material by a cableway to silos about 1,000 yards distant, is stated to work out at 35 ore (4-7$.), 40 ore (5-4d.), and 45 ore (6-Id.) per ton respectively for limestone, gas-coal, and anthracite (Engineering, 1909, Vol. 87, p. 405). In thej-South African mining industry, where vast quantities of materials are dealt with, the costs involved in sorting, transporting, and crushing the ore amount to about 6d. per ton, the transport alone accounting for about 2d. per ton.- Taking the case of the briquetting in-dustry in South Wales as a last example, the labour costs alone amount to about 4&apos;5cZ. per ton of briquettes made.Reviewing the evidence available upon the peat problem in the light of the above figures, it is clear that the costs involved in excavating or dredging peat, and in transporting it to the drying and producer plant, are not likely to be less than several pence per ton of raw peat even when the most up-to-date machinery and methods are employed. A reduction in the operating costs may, however, be effected by the development of other systems of dealing with raw peat; of these, the method, attempted on a large scale at Dumfries, of pumping macerated peat and thus avoiding to a considerable extent the handling of solid materials, appears to be the most promisiug.Revenue  rom Sulphate and By-products.In the second place, the revenue from the sale of ammonium sulphate must always represent a sub-stantial factor in the economics of peat processes, Although the market price of sulphate has been on the increase during the last 10 years, the prospects of the price being maintained cannot be regarded&apos;as definitely assured in view of the increasing compe-tition of synthetic nitrogen processes. Moreover, the cost of manufacturing sulphate at peat installations is, in general, likely to be higher than at most gas-works and coke-ovens owing to the distance of peat bogs from industrial centres and the consequent en-hanced cost of sulphuric acid. Increased working costs of this character tend to diminish the nett re-venue obtainable from the ammonium sulphate.Other by-products are also obtainable by the gasifi-cation of peat; for example, the aqueous distillate from the producers contains organic substances such as methyl alcohol, acetone, and acetic acid, while the peat tar. upon distillation yields light oils, fuel oils, creosote oils, wax, and pitch (Journal, Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland, Vol. XVI, No. 1). The revenue from the sale of such products, for which there is a large demand, may have an important bearing upon the development of peat utilisation processes, but the information available to the Sub-Committee on this question is not of a precise character.Influence of Local Conditions.In the next place, the success of ar.y particular nitrogen recovery installation is certain to be infiu-experienced to a considerable extent by local conditions, particularly as regards the availability and cost of transport and labour, and the proximity of a demand for power gas or electricity. Failing a neighbouring demand, the installation would have to be operated for by-product recovery alone, with a loss in economy consequent upon the waste of the surplus power gas resulting from the process, or in conjunction with the manufacture of peat briquettes.Capital Costs.Lastly, the capital involved in operating peat pro-cesses is substantial, as is shown by the following summary of the figures previously given :- (a) Orentano Installation. The capital cost, in-cluding power plant and power transmission line, is given as  31,000, the rated capacity of the plant being 70 tons of dry peat per day, or 106,500 tons of raw peat (77 per cent, water) per annum. Upon this basis the capital cost is equivalent to  29 -1 per 100 tons of raw peat per annum.(b) Wet - Carbonising Process.   The   estimatedcapital cost of a nitrogen recovery plant , &apos; dealing with 1,750,000 tons of raw peat (94 per cent, water) per annum is given as  175,000, or  10 per 100 tons of raw peat per annum,(c) Buckle Process. The estimated capital cost ofa nitrogen recovery plant dealing with 560,000 tons of raw peat (85 per cent, water) per annum is given as  115,000, or  20&apos;5 per 100 tons of raw peat per annum.(d) Irish Scheme.   The estimated capital cost,including power plant, power transmission line, and purchase of bog, is given as  330,000 for an installation dealing with about 540,000 tons of raw peat (85 per cent, water) per annum, or  61-1 per 100 tons of raw peat per annum.; In the case of the estimates relating to nitrogen recovery installations alone, the capital costs, when calculated in terms of the output of ammonium sulphate, amount to from  24 to  40 per ton per annum according to the figures given in connection with the wet carbonising process, and to  16-4 per ton per annuin according to the figures given for the
Buckle Process. These figures, however, are governed by the nitrogen content of the peat, and hence the quantity used in the production of the sulphate.Value of Cleared Land.Reference must be made to one other factor that has a distinct bearing upon the economics of the utilisation of peat, namely, the value of the land for agricultural and other purposes after the removal of the peat. This factor depends upon considerations such as the nature of the subsoil, the relative drainage level of the country surrounding the bog, and faci-facilities for transport, and in general must be regarded as an asset of indefinite value. In particular cases, for example, at favourably situated bogs in Ireland, it ds^anticipated that the removal of the peat will render the land available for agriculture, and thus cause its value to appreciate. In other cases, as at Wiesmoor in Germany, the main objective has been the clearing of the land for cultivation, the peat installa-tion serving the secondary purpose of providing the necessary power.The attractiveness of the peat problem is evidenced by the large number of attempts that nave been made to solve it, both from the point of view of fuel and power production and of nitrogen recovery, It still remains, however, to be substantiated on a commercial scale that the reduction of the moisture content of raw peat can be economically effected by a method capable of continuous operation throughout the year tinder varying climatic conditions and applicable to the different varieties of peat.
9r; qI ll c  appendix v. : sewage. 311SECTION XIV.NITROGEN RECOVERY FROM SEWAGE.Until comparatively recent times the excretions of human beings and domesticated animals, together with refuse animal products such as bones, horn, wool and blood, constituted practically the only commercial sources of ammoniacal compounds. The fermentation of urine, resulting in the conversion of the urea into ammonium carbonate, and the destructive distillation of animal products such as bones and horn provided methods of obtaining ammonia, while the sublimation of the soot formed in burning dried camel&apos;s dung, which is saline as well as nitrogenous, was long the only method of manufacturing sal ammoniac. Moreover the heating of nitrogenous animal matters with potash or soda constituted the standard method of obtaining cyanides and ferro and ferri-cyanides. including Prussian blue, prior to the development of the modern cyanide industry.The amount of combined nitrogen actually recovered in operations of the above character represented an insignificant proportion of the total potentially available, but further large quantities were conserved and utilised directly owing to the extensive application of animal manure and refuse to the soil for fertilising purposes. Such methods of utilisation, however, were attended with considerable losses of combined nitrogen, and this is equally the case under modern conditions. It has been demonstrated, for example, that the losses from farmyard manure may vary from 3 per cent, to as much as 40 per cent, or more, according to the conditions of heaping and storage (Russell, Soils and Manures, 1915, p. 153).The above observations clearly indicate that the nitrogen problem in relation to excremental and refuse matters has two distinct aspects, namely, the con-servation of the nitrogen by the direct utilisation of the products, and the actual recovery of the nitrogen in a marketable form. This Section is devoted mainly to the consideration of the problem of the recovery of combined nitrogen from domestic sewage, but reference is also made to a number of methods of utilising the sewage directly on the land.Although it has long been recognised that the combined nitrogen in human excretions represents a potential asset of considerable magnitude, but few systematic attempts have been made on a large scale to recover this nitrogen on account of the difficulties and unpleasant character of the operations involved. Practically the only successful recovery operations have been carried out abroad at places where the sewage available was in a concentrated form; their application to water-borne sewage would be altogether uneconomical. With the advent of main drainage systems, the difficulties in the way of recovering nitrogen from sewage have been greatly increased, by far the largest proportion of the combined nitrogen being carried away in solution, as noted in more detail later.In view of the statements sometimes made as to the possible output of ammonia nitrogen from the sewage of the United Kingdom, the Sub-Committee has taken steps to ascertain both the extent and also the general character of the problem. The information sot out below is largely based upon a memorandum supplied to the Sub-Committee from an authoritative source.Nitrogen Content of Human Excretions.The urine secreted by a man weighing 70 kg. on an average nitrogenous diet (118 gms. protein) amounts to about 1,500 c.c. per day, and contains 16 gms. of nitrogen. The urine contains 60 gms. of solids, of which 25 gms. are inorganic salts, while the remaining 35 gms. are organic bodies containing nitrogen, 30 gms. being urea. -In the case of a woman, whose averagediet is considered to contain about 80 per cent, of the protein content of that of a man, the nitrogen excretion in the urine may be taken at 13 gms. per day. In the case of children, up to say 15 years of age, the daily excretion of nitrogen in the urine varies from about 6 * 4 gms. to 9&apos; 5 gms., according to age, and the average value may be taken at 8 gms. per diem.With regard to fseces, the amount and the nitrogen content vary with the nature of the diet. It is generally accepted that the undried frcces contain from 5 to 9 per cent, of nitrogen, and a fair average for the nitrogen excretion in the fajces taken on the whole population may be placed at 2 gms. per person per diem.The Extent of the Problem.Upon the basis of the census of 1911, and of other information, the pojmlation of the United Kingdom may be allocated approximately as follows : Adult males.....14,560,000Adult females .... 15,440,000 Children up to 15 years of age    &apos; -   15,000.000Total45,000,000Taking the figures given above for the daily excre-tion of nitrogen per person, the nitrogen content of the domestic sewage in the United Kingdom is approxi-mately as follows : Per Day.     Per Annum.Nitrogen in urine Nitrogen in faicesTotalMetric tons.- 553- 90- 643Metric tons. 202,000 32,900234,900Of the total excretion of nitrogen, about 86 per cent is thus contained in urine.The average annual output of ammonia in this country during the years 1911-13, reckoned in terms of ammonium sulphate (25 per cent. NH.,), amounted to about 394,000 long tons, corresponding to about 82,400 metric tons of combined nitrogen, while the average annual consumption of fertilisers in the form of ammonium sulphate and Chile nitrate amounted to about 25,000 metric tons of combined nitrogen. The quantity of nitrogen excreted annually by the population of this country is therefore over nine times that employed under pre-war conditions in the form of the fertilisers mentioned, and nearly three times as ,much as the average pre-war production of ammonia nitrogen.In addition to the nitrogen contained in domestic sewage, much nitrogen is also lost annually in the excreta of animals, while the waste liquors from certain trades, such as from wool scouring and glue factories, contain considerable quantities of combined nitrogen.General Character of Problem.According to the census returns of 1911, 60 per cent, of the inhabitants -of Great Britain and 25 per cent, of those of Ireland then lived in &quot;towns.&quot; It would be impossible to obtain accurate figures at the present time, but it may probably be taken with a fair degtee of accuracy that the houses of about half the population inv the United Kingdom are connected or partially connected up to the sewers.With regard to the population whose houses are not connected up to sewers, the excreta, together with a considerable proportion of the urine, is either even-tually put on the land or might be made available for this purpose. Under present conditions, however, most of the nitrogen must be lost from leaky cess-pits and the like.   The transference of the excreta to the soil of a
garden or field, if properly carried out, can ho done quite inoffensively and with great benefit to the soil. The difficulty, in practice, is to ensure this being properly done.Considering that the largest proportion of the ex-creted nitrogen is in the urine, it might he expected that attempts to conserve or utilise the nitrogen would have some prospects of success, especially in cases where concentrated urine is available in large quan-tities, for example, at military camps, Processes involving the distillation of putrefied urine for the recovery of ammonia have been carried out upon a substantial scale in other countries, but have, not found an application in the United Kingdom. In the case of other processes for dealing with concentrated urine, investigations have demonstrated that schemes depending upon methods of bacterial nitrification such as are in common use cannot be applied without con-siderable losses of nitrogen. The direct absorption of the nitrogen compounds for the production of fertilisers ,affords another line of investigation, and experiments have been initiated by the Munitions Inventions De-partment. The action of two types of material will be investigated, namely, materials capable of entering into chemical combination with various products eon-tained in urine and materials possessing high powers of physical absorption.With regard to the population whose houses are con-nected up to sewers, pratically all the urine and most of the faeces are lost altogether a* far as nitrogen recovery or manurial purposes are concerned. In the case of London, for example, the sewage is clarified by precipitation and the tank liquor discharged into the Thames, the sludge being taken out to sea and dis-charged. In the case of Manchester, the sewage is sedimented in septic tanks and the sludge is sent out to sea. The tank liquor is treated on contact beds and the effluent from the beds discharged into the Ship Canal. Towns on the coast mostly discharge direct into the sea, with or without preliminary settle-nient of the sludge.It will be seen, therefore, that with existing con-ditions and methods of sewage disposal a very large proportion of the annual excretion of nitrogen is dis-charged as a very dilute solution from which its recovery by existing methods appears to be economically impossible.Nitrogen in solution in Sewage.Sewage of average strength contains approximately 5 parts of ammonia nitrogen and from 2 to 2-5 parts of organic nitrogen per 100,000 parts of sewage, together with 30 parts of organic and inorganic solids in suspension. The only practicable way at present of utilising the nitrogen in solution i.e., the ammonia, .whether from crude sewage, settled sewage, tank liquor, or bacterial filter effluent (in which case the nitrogen will be partly in the form of nitrate) is by irrigation and filtration on sewage farms, the sludge from the settled sewage or tank liquor being used for manuring another portion of the land for such crops as will not stand much water.C, Since the degree to which nitrogen is assimilated by plants depends upon the temperature, the soluble nitrogen of a sewage farm can, in general, only be utilised during the warmer months of the year. In cold and wet weather the nitrates and, to a lesser degree, the ammonia find their way through the drains to the streams; this loss is at present unavoidable.It is possible that in course of time some cheap reagents may become available for precipitating the ammonia and.nitrate nitrogen from sewage liquors and effluents, and thus lead to the recovery or the more^fficient utilisation of soluble nitrogen at present largely wasted.Insoluble Nitrogen in Sewage.Of the solids in suspension in sewage, namely; about 30 parts per 100,000 of sewage, some two-thirds are volatile on ignition, they are for the most part organic, and include nitrogen compounds.Except in those cases where unsettled sewage can be safely discharged into the sea or run directly on to the land without risk of nuisance, sewage is alwayssubjected to some lciiid of sedimentation prior to further treatment, with the production of sludge of one type or another, such as settled sludge, precipita-tion sludge, septic tank sludge, and sludge from the &apos;new &quot;activated sludge&quot; process of sewage purification to which reference is made later.Taking the percentages of water in the sludges generally at 90 per cent., the following figures show the production of wet sludge in dry weather per million gallons of sewage : Tuns.(jo) Quiescent settlement without chemicals - 12 Qi) Continuous   How   settlement   withoutchemicals......11(e) Quiescent settlement with chemicals - 17 (rf) Continuous (low settlement with chemicals 10 (e) Septic tank......6&apos;5Upon the basis of an average flow of 30 gallons of sewage per head per day, the production of such sludges from a town of 100,000 inhabitants would be as follows per day(ft) 30 tons. (JO 33 00 61   ,,(d)0048 tons. 10-5 ,,The sludge contains the organic nitrogen corn-pounds previously referred to, and when dried down to a moisture content of about 20 to 30 per cent, may contain from 1 per cent, to 2 per cent, of combined nitrogen. This nitrogen, however, appears to be in a condition in which it is not readily assimilable by plants, and the resistant character of the nitroger compounds is probably increased by the considerable amount of grease that is always present in domestic sewage.The use of efficient grease traps and household recovery would not only lead to the conservation of large quantities of fat, but the&apos; absence of fat would lessen the labour at sewage works, would increase the effi-ciency of bacterial filters and of the soil of sewage farms, and would improve the value of sewage sludge as a manure.UTILISATION OE SEWAGE SLUDGE.Sewage sludges are utilised in various ways, and the following brief summary indicates some of the methods whereby the nitrogen content is made use of for agricultural purposes. Methods involving the re-covery of ammonia from sewage are dealt with later.In some cases the sludge is run or pumped in a semi-liquid condition into shallow trenches dug in a field of good porous soil. After the mud has drained and dried sufficiently, the trench is filled in with its excavated earth. If the ground is suitable and the proportion of added sludge not too great, the soil is naturally improved by this treatment, and good crops can be grown on it.In other cases the sludge is mixed with lime and as much water as possible is expressed by a suitable sludge press. The pressed cake, which contains a -considerable excess of lime and is highly alkaline, has a moisture content of from 50 to 60 per cent. It is used to some extent as a manure, but has not much value for this purpose, partly because it is not in a line enough state of division, and partly, no doubt, because of the fat present in it.Sludge is also made up direct into a manure by submitting it to drying and grinding operations.By the addition of yeast to sewage, the resulting fermentation also brings about a concentration of the sludge to a moisture content of approximately 82 per cent. The residue is then dried for manure, the product containing from 2 to 2-5 per cent, of nitrogen.Mention may also be made of a method by which the grease is recovered before the sludge is utilised as a manure. In this process the sewage is acidified with sulphuric acid and allowed to stand for some time, resulting in the concentration of the sludge to a moisture content of about 80 per cent. The concen-trated sludge is then dried, mixed with a continuous stream of sulphuric acid, and the fatty acids distilled off, the degreased residue being mixed with phosphate, etc. and sold as manure.
ACTIVATED SLUDGE PROCESS.Among the more recent developments in the purl-fication of sewage, the establishment of the activated sludge process on a largo scale both in this country and in America calls for special mention on account of the prospect it holds out of conserving more of the nitrogen contained in domestic sewage than has hitherto been the case.The process consists in mixing fresh sewage with some &quot; activated&quot; sludge from a previous operation, and then blowing air into the mixture for several hours through porous tiles. The bacterial oxidation of the sewage can be stopped at the end of the carbon oxida-tion stage, or carried further, according to the quality of effluent desired. Only a very small percentage of the air blown in is actually required for the oxidation, the air also serving as an efficient stirrer, and prevent-ing any deposition of sludge which would result in the setting up of local deoxidising action.A resume of the present position of the process with details concerning the operation of the trial and large scale installations in this country at Manchester, Salford, &quot;Worcester, and Stamford, and in America, has recently been published (Journal of the Society of Chemical Industry, Vol. 36, No. 14, pp. 822-830), and indicates the factors that have to be taken into account in considering the future of the process. It appears that the cost of energy for running the air compressors has been a serious item,in several cases up to the present, and reference is also made to the compliea-tions introduced by the presence of excessive quantities of oily matters and strongly inhibitory trade effluents in the sewage. The outstanding feature of the process is stated to consist&apos; in the recovery of a considerable proportion of the total nitrogen content in a form available for agricultural purposes. The dried sludge contains from 4 to 6 per cent, of nitrogen, according to the character of the sewage treated, and also appreci-able quantities of phosphate. It is pointed out that the problem of removing the water from the sludge and of drying it to render it transportable is therefore of great importance; also that the full agricultural value of the sludge, including any advantage due to bacterial inoculation, would be utilised by pumping the sludge direct to farm lands in the vicinity of the sewage works.AMMONIA RECOVERY.Although many methods have been proposed for recovering nitrogen from sewage, the number of instances in which large scale operations have been carried out is limited. The systems mainly used have involved distillation processes, and have been applied abroad in cases where the conditions permitted the utilisation of sewage of a concentrated character. It is obvious that such processes could not be economically applied in the case of sewage diluted with very large quantities of water as is obtained under modern conditions of sanitation.It was at one time proposed to instal a conservation process at a small town in this country, but the project fell through. A system involving the carboni-sation of sewage sludge has, however, been in operation in this country since 1913, and an account of the process is given later.iDistillation Processes.The systematic collection of urine and &apos; faecal matter for the manufacture of ammonium compounds by methods involving the distillation of the clarified liquors has been successfully practised abroad, for example in France, but the operations are of a nauseous character, and are stated to be both costly and dangerous. A brief account may be given of some of the methods that have been in vogue in France, where the recovery of nitrogen from sewage has probably, on the whole, been carried out on a larger scale than in other countries.In Paris, for example, urine and night-soil to the amount of about 2,200 cu. m. were collected daily and, after being partly disinfected, were allowed to undergofermontation and settlement in largo reservoirs (Lungo, Coal Tar and Ammonia, 1916, Part III., pp. 1154-1101). The process was completed in 3 or 4 weeks, the urea being mainly converted into ammonium carbonate, although other ammonium compounds, some of which have intensely disagreeable smell, wero also formed. Tho loss of nitrogen during fermentation was considerable, some being evolved as such, while ammonia was also lost not only by evaporation, but through partial oxidation to nitric acid. The clear liquor was finally drawn off and distilled for the recovery of ammonia, the deposited sludge being converted into a manure.Another method of operation (Lunge, previously quoted) involved the chemical treatment of the sewage to promote rapid settlement, the sewage being me-chanically agitated and mixed with a measured quantity of reagent, principally milk of lime of sp. gr. 1&apos; 16 to 1- 20, before admission to the tanks. The clear liquor after settlement was periodically decanted and re-placed by fresh mixture from the agitator until the tanks were finally full of sludge. The ammonia con-tained in the clear liquor was recovered by distillation, while the sludge was heated by steam and filter-pressed, the ammonia liberated during the heating being fixed by means of sulphuric acid. Every 100 cu. m. of crude sewage yielded 75 cu. m. of liquor and 25 cu. m. of sludge, the latter yielding 6 or 7 tons of filter cake containing 50 per cent, of moisture. The manurial value of the cake was small, but the nitrogen content was higher the less the amount of lime added in the agitators.A third system involved preliminary settlement of the sewage, the clear liquor being distilled for ammonia and the sludge afterwards treated in a closed mixer with a-eagents consisting of chlorides of iron and aluminium and phosphate of lime. The materials remained in the mixer for about 24 hours, and after decantation of the clear liquor that collected, the sludge was filter-pressed. The cakes contained 3 to 3- 5 per cent. of. nitrogen and 10 to 12 per cent, of assimilable phosphoric acid in the form of bicalcic phosphate and were used as a manure. (Lunge, previously quoted.)The processes described above depended upon the availability of sewage in a concentrated form.The distillation of sewage with lime was also tried on a large experimental scale at Amsterdam, the plant having a capacity of 50 tons per day and being similar to that employed for distilling gas liquor. The sewage contained 2 - 018 per cent, of free ammonia and 0&apos; 326 per cent, of fixed ammonia, while only 0&apos;008 per cent, remained in the waste liquors from the process. The treatment of 8,750 tons of sewage, involving the use of 123 tons of quicklime, 153 tons of coal, and 72 tons of sulphuric acid, yielded 72 tons of ammonium sulphate. The fixed residue mixed with lime and pressed in a filter contained 58 per cent, of dry sub-stance, 52-27 per cent, of calcium carbonate, 0&apos;518 per cent, of nitrogen, 0&apos;155 per cent, of K20 and 0*157 per cent, of P3Os.   (Lunge, previously quoted.)It has been stated that the production of ammo-nium sulphate from sewage in France amounted in 1909 to 13,000 tons, of which 10,000 tons were manu-factured from the sewage of Paris,Carbonisation of Sewage Sludge.Reference has already been made to the con-siderable quantities of fatty matters present in sewage, and interest attaches to a process now being operated in this country on a moderate scale for the recovery of aminonia and oils from sewage sludge by carbonisation at a low temperature. The plant deals with the whole of the sewage sludge from a population of 55,000, or thereabouts, corresponding, to about 12 tons of solid sludgeper day. Full details of the process, together \with estimates of the probable costs involved in operating it upon larger scales, have been supplied to the Sub-Committee, and the plant has beon inspected in operation by one of its members. The method, whether ultimately successful or not, provides an indi-cation as to the nature and quantities of the products which may be obtainable from sewage sludge, and for this reason it is dealt with in some detail below.
The process is carried out in the following manner: Pressed sludge cake containing (35 to 75 per cent, of water and about 0&apos; 9 per cent, of nitrogen is passed on to a chain belt conveyer and carried through flues supplied with hot gases from the retort settings at a temperature of about 200o to 2150 C. The dried cake, containing about 25 per cent, of moisture, is then carbonised in vertical cast-iron retoits for a period of about 6 to 8 hours, the gaseous products being carried through a main to scrubbers. where the oils and ammonia are taken out. The products obtainable per ton of sludge carbonised are stated to be as follows, namely: 54 to 60 lb. of ammonium sulphate, 14 to 15 gals, of fuel oil, 5 to 7 gals, of light oil and spirit, a fuel gas having a calorific value of about 130 B. Th. U. per cu. ft., and a solid residue amounting to 10 or 12 cwt. The residue consists of a black powder containing 0*19 per cent, of nitrogen and a considerable quantity of lime, the latter having been used in the precipitation of the sewage. The fuel gas is used for heating the retorts and for drying the pressed sludge cake, and it is stated that a ton of sludge cake (25 per cent, water) yields about 12,500 cu. ft. of gas when carbonised at a temperature of 700&quot; 0.At the date (May 1917) when the plant was in-inspected, the oil-rectifying and sulphate recovery sections of the installation had not been completed. The plant, however, was considered to be quite substantial, although somewhat experimental in lay-out. The working temperature was about 560&quot; to 600o 0., but the fuel gas obtained was insufficient for heating the retorts, and had to be supplemented by producer gas. Moreover, by the system of drying, the moisture content of the pressed sludge cake was not reduced below 40 to 45 per cent., and practically the whole difficulty of any such process may be said to reside in the di^ying of the sludge.cake. If presses could be obtained to reduce the moisture to 40 per cent, by filtration, it was proposed to carbonise without further drying.Yield of By-products from Sludge.The composition of the sludge, and hence the yield of by-products, is stated to be fairly constant for a particular district where the sewage is wholly or mainly domestic. In industrial areas, however, there is variation, leading to the recovery of larger amounts of some products; for instance, the sludge from the Bradford district, where the sewage contains wool-washing liquors, yields about 43- 5 gals, of oil per ton.The following figures were supplied to the Sub-Committee to indicate the order of the quantities of by-products recoverable by the more extended appli-cation of the carbonisation process.The approximate amount of sewage sludge (50 per cent, water) available per 1,000 inhabitants is placed at 100 tons per annum, and the quantity available from all the towns in the United Kingdom with a population of over 100,000, is placed at about 1,800,000 tons per annum. Taking the latter figure as equivalent to, say, 2,750 tons of dried sludge (20 per cent, water) per day, the products obtainable by the carbonisation of the above quantity of sludge are given as. follows upon the basis of the results already obtained, and of tests of the sludge from other districts: Per day.

One relates to an installation capable of dealing with 600 tons of dried sludge (20 per cent, water) per day, and the other to an installation having a capacity of 100 tons per day. The larger installation would be approxi-mately adequate for dealing with the outfalls at Oross-ness of the London County Council drainage area, while the smaller would be suitable for cities such as Glasgow or Sheffield.Total13,250-   204,500Large	Smallplant.	plant.  per day.	  per day.210	6010	541	9-h2gi	 74  .The capital cost of the corresponding smaller instal-lation is given as approximately  45,000.Operating Costs and Revenue. The estimated daily-costs involved in the operation of the two installations are quoted as follows : Works costs (management, labour, light, power, stores, &amp;c.) -   &quot; -O verliead charges -Depreciation at 7&apos;5 percent.total the carbonisation of a ton of dried sludge (20 per cent, water) is estimated to yield on an average the following quantities of products : 50 lb. of ammonium sulphate, 12 gals, of fuel oil, 4 gals, of light spirit, and 10 cwt. of solid residue which can be utilised as a fertiliser base.The value of the fuel oil is placed at 3d. per gal., of the light spirit at Is. per gal., and of the residue at 10s. per ton. On the basis of these figures, and taking the value of ammonium sulphate at  12- 5 per ton, the daily revenue in the case&apos; of the large installation would amount, to about  526, and in the case of the small installation to about  88.Observations. Upon the basis of the estimated&apos; operating costs and of the revenue figures given above, a moderate margin of profit is shown in the case of the small installation, and a very substantial margin in the case of the large one.The Sub-Committee has no information as to other sewage disposal operations involving the carbonisation of sludge, or of the quantities and values of the products recoverable. In the absence of further evidence, no attempt has been made to examine critically the esti-mated operating costs put forward, but the following general observations may be made : Assuming that the costs involved in recovering and working up the by-products were in accordance with the practice in other industries in which ammonia and oils are dealt with, there is some uncertainty as to the cost of handling and drying the original sludge cake and of carbonising it at a low temperature. The sludge cake as delivered to the plant will probably contain from 65 to 75 per cent, of water, and taking an approximate figure of 70 per cent., the production of 100 tons of dried sludge (20 per cent, water) involves the handling and drying of about 266 tons of sludge cake (70 per cent, water), the latter operation corresponding to the removal of about 166 tons of water. The problem of reducing the water content below about 70 per cent, by mechanical means does not appear to have been economically solved, and the further drying has to be effected artificially. In this respect the utilisation of sewage sludge presents a close analogy with the problem of utilising peat. (Section XIII.) The breaking up of the raw sludge cake to feed uniformly on to conveyers also appears to present some difficulty.The Sub-Committee is of the opinion that the experience gained with the comparatively small and incomplete installation at present in operation can hardly be regarded as sufficient for establishing the operating costs likely to be incurred with much larger nstallations of the capacity specified above.
GENERAL OBSERVATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS.From a consideration of the general conditions of modern sanitation, and from the evidence previously discussed, it is apparent that a very large proportion of the combined nitrogen excreted annually in domestic sewage is irrecoverable, at any rate by existing methods.About 86 per cent, of the total nitrogen is excreted in the form of urine, and in the case of the half of the population connected up to sewers, the sewage is so largely diluted with water that in the present state of our knowledge it would be uneconomical to attempt to recover the nitrogen. In this connection, however, reference may again be made to the possible discovery of cheap reagents capable of effecting the precipitation of the soluble nitrogen. It is also clear that a con-siderable portion of the faeces passing into main drainage systems is lost, and as far as nitrogen recovery is concerned, the utilisation of sewage sludge is hampered by the high moisture content and the low nitrogen content of the material. Even in the case of the activated sludge process of sewage purification, it appears that the sludge when free from moisture does not contain more than 4 to 6 per cent, of nitrogen.In the case of the half of the population not con-nected to sewers, it is possible that in special cases the systematic collection of the concentrated sewage might be undertaken for the recovery of ammonia as has been done in places abroad. Such operations, however, have not hitherto found favour in this country, and judging by experience in other countries the amount of combined nitrogen that could bo profitably recovered in this way would be very small as compared with the output from the by-product ammonia industry in the United Kingdom.The detrimental effect of the considerable amount of fatty matters present in domestic sewage upon the efficiency of bacterial filters, the soil of sewage farms, and the manurial value of the sludge could be largely or wholly avoided by the employment of efficient domestic grease traps, while the systematic collection of the fats would lead to the conservation of large quantities of valuable products at present wasted. The latter result could also be achieved, although perhaps in a less advantageous manner from the point of view of sewage purification, by the extended development of a carbonisation process, such as that previously referred to, for the treatment of sewage  fudge. By this method a certain amount of com-bined nitrogen would also be recovered.It is clear, however, that the application of carboni-sation processes to sewage sludge would have only a small effect irpon the home production of combined nitrogen. The annual excretion of nitrogen in fracas amounts to about 32,900 metric tons, and of this quantity only one half,&apos; namely, 16,450 metric tons, equivalent to about 82,000 metric tons of ammo-nium sulphate, passes into sewers. The amount of sulphate estimated to be recoverable from sewage sludge by installing a carbonisation process at all towns having a population of 100,000 or over is only about 22,000 tons, or approximately 5 per cent, of tho pre-war production of the by - product ammonia industry.
SECTION XV.FUEL REQUIREMENTS OF NITROGEN FIXATION AND RECOVERY PROCESSES.Note. Attention is drawn to the note (ii) on the title page of this Appendix.In a country like the United Kingdom where large water-powers are not available, reliance has to be placed upon coal for the generation of electrical power for nitrogen iixation purposes. It is of some importance, therefore, to compare the approximate quantities of coal required for the fixation or recovery of a ton of combined nitrogen by the various processes and methods already considered.The consumption of fuel may be conveniently dealt with under two headings, namely, that necessary for meeting the power requirements and that needed in process operations such as in the working up of ammoniacal liquors for the production of ammonium sulphate, in the manufacture of calcium carbide for conversion into cyanamide, and in the production of hydrogen for the Haber process by methods involving the employment of water-gas.For the purpose of nitrogen fixation it appears irrational to generate electrical power by the direct combustion of coal seeing that the whole of the combined nitrogen contained in the coal is lost in the process of combustion. It is possible, however, to convert the coal into power gas by means of by-product recovery plant and to conserve about 70 per cent, of its combined nitrogen in this manner, although it has yet to be demonstrated that such methods can be economically applied to large-scale power production. Apart from economic considerations, it is desirable to indicate the quantities of fuel needed for power production by the two systems just referred to, namely, by the direct combustion of raw coal and by the employment of power gas, the latter being obtained by the complete gasification of coal in recovery producers, or by submitting the coal to low temperature carbonisation as a first stage and then gasifying the resulting coke in recovery producers.The quantities of by-product nitrogen lost or recoverable from the coal in each case are specified later.POWER REQUIREMENTS.The consumption of coal per unit output of power depends among other factors upon the scale or size of the power plant, large plants being rather more economical than the small ones, and upon the particular method adopted for utilising the coal.Having regard to the wide variation in the power requirements of the main synthetic processes, it is necessary, in order to render the figures closely comparable, to assume that each process is operated on a sufficient scale to ensure reasonable economy. In the case of the arc, cyanamide, and Haber processes, the scale selected is equivalent to an annual output of 12,000 to 15,000 tons of combined nitrogen, the sizes of the corresponding power stations being of the order of 100,000 lew., 30,000 lew., and 5,000- to 6,000 k.w. maximum demand respectively. For such stations it has been assumed that turbo-electric generator units of 25,000 k.w., 7,500 lew., and 1,000 to 1,250 k.w. capacity respectively would be employed.Alternative figures are given in some instances for the fuel requirements of gas-engine electric plant, but only in cases where the consumption of electrical energy is small, such as in the Haber, ammonia oxidation, and Hausser processes.   With regard tothe Haber process the fuel for a gas-engine power plant could be obtained from the water-gas plant used for the manufacture of the necessary hydrogen, and in the case of the Hausser process, coke-oven gas could be utilised partly for gas-engine power plant and partly for the chemical plant.Basic Figures.The whole of the figures relating to direct coal-fired steam power plant are based upon the employment of coal, having a calorific value of 12,500 B.Th.U. per lb. as fired, the thermal efficiency of the steam boilers being taken as 80 per cent.The quality of coal required for the production of power gas with by-product recovery will differ from that required for direct coal-firing, a high nitrogen content, for example, being a desideratum. In the case, therefore, of power production by methods in-volving the complete gasification of coal in recovery producers, or preliminary carbonisation at a low temperature followed by gasification of the coke, the data given in a previous Appendix (Appendix IV.) has been utilised. The calorific value of the coal as fired has been taken at 12,000 B.Th.U. per lb,, and it has also been assumed that the thermal efficiency of gas-fired steam boilers amounts to 75 per cent, as compared with SO per cent, in the case of direct coal-fired boilers.In the case of power production by methods in-volving the gasification of coal or low temperature coke in recovery producers and the subsequent employ -ment of the power gas for raising steam for turbo-electric plant, it has been assumed that the nett steam requirements of the producers and recovery plant are met by abstracting steam from a low pressure stage of the main turbines. On the other hand, when the power gas is subsequently employed in gas-engines, it has been assumed that the waste heat in the exhaust gases from the engines is fully utilised for steam-rasing, and that the whole of this steam and any additional quantity required to be raised in gas-fired boilers is passed through steam-turbo plant before being used as exhaust steam in the recovery producer installation (Appendix IV., Sections III., V., and VII.).The figures for the fuel consumption for power production by schemes involving low temperature car-bonisation represent the mean value for the two systems dealt with in Appendix IV.Coal Requirements of Power Stations. /The tables given below are based upon the figures just mentioned and indicate the overall coal require-ments in the case of coal-fired and gas-fired steam turbo-electric power stations, and in the case of gas-engine electric plant. The first column in each caw, specifies the number of thermal units required either by the steam boilers or by the gas-engines per k.w.-hour available at the station switchboard. Other columns are given to show the total consumption of coal per k.w.-year of 8,760 hours and per k.w.-year of 8,400 to 8,500 hours, corresponding to the operation of the power plant at load factors of 100 per cent, and of 96-97 per cent, respectively.

By taking the values there specified in conjunction with the figures set out in the above tables, the following comparative statement has been obtained showing the quantity of coal consumed by the power plant per metric ton of nitrogen fixed or recovered. It should be noted that the quantities of coal are expressed in terms of long tons (2,240 lb.) as in the previous tables.TABLE I.-DIRECT COAL-FIRED STEAM TURBO-ELECTRIC STATIONS.

It is due to the low overall thermal efficiency of the gasification processes.PROCESS REQUIREMENTS.The quantities of fuel required for the chemical operations involved in the various nitrogen recovery and fixation processes are set out below.The figures given under this heading are based in all cases upon an output of a metric ton of combined nitrogen in the form of the products specified, the fuel requirements being expressed in terms of long tons (2,240 lb.) as before.Nitric Acid from Chile Nitrate.The fuel required for the production by the retort process of a long ton of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) in the form of concentrated nitric acid amounts to 4 cwt. (Section I.), thus corresponding to 0-88 ton of fuel per metric ton of combined nitrogen in the form of concentrated acid. This figure does not take account of the fuel used in the production of the nitrate itself in Chile.By-Product Ammonia and Ammonium Sulphate.A brief examination may be made regarding the fuel required for converting crude gasworks liquor into ammonia spirit (20 to 25 per cent. NH3) and for the production of ammonium sulphate from gas-liquor.Ammonia Spirit. According to evidence from one source, the manufacture of ammonia spirit from crude gas-liquor (10 oz. strength = 2-17 per cent. NH3) involves the employment of 1 ton of fuel (coke and breeze) for every 10 tons of liquor dealt with. Allowing for a loss of 5 per cent, of the ammonia during the concentration and purification process (Section II.), a metric ton of ammonia in the form of pure spirit (20 to 25 per cent. M;I) is obtained from 47-7 tons of gas-liquor, thus involving the employment of 4-77 tons of fuel.Other information places the fuel requirements at 22 cwt. per 2,600 gals, of gas-liquor (10 oz. strength) corresponding to approximately 0-95 ton of fuel per 10 tons of liquor. In this case the fuel required for obtaining a metric ton of ammonia in the form of pure spirit amounts to 4 -53 tons.Upon the basis of the above figures, the fuel re-quired for converting gasworks liquor (2-17 percent. NH3) into pure ammonia spirit (20 to 25 per cent.) appears to be of the order of 4 - 6 tons per metric ton of actual NH3, or 5 - 6 tons per metric ton of combined nitrogen -in the form of pure ammonia spirit.Ammonium Sulphate. With regard to the manu-facture of ammonium sidphate (25 per cent. NH3) from gas-liquor of 8-oz. strength (1 - 73 per cent. NH3) evidence received from an authoritative source indicates that about 2 cwt of fuel are utilised in i making a long ton of sulphuric acid (70 per cent.) by the chamber process, and 1-3 tons of fuel in the ammonium sulphate stage of the process. As 1-1 tons of acid are used for the production of a long ton of sulphate (25 per cent. NH3), the total fuel require-ments for the two stages amount to 1 - 41 tons. Upon this basis, the production of a metric ton of ammonia
in the form of sulphate (25 per cent. NH3) from 8-oz. gas-liquor, including the manufacture of the necessary sulphuric acid, entails the use of 5&apos;55 tons of fuel, corresponding to 6-7 tons of fuel per metric ton of combined nitrogen in the form of sulphate.Production of Gasworks Liquor. The above figures take no account of the quantity of coal that has to be carbonised for yielding the necessary ammonia liquor. Taking average gasworks practice, the amount of ammonium sulphate obtained from a ton of coal may be placed at 28 lb., corresponding to 3 &quot;176 kg, of ammonia. The quantity of coal carbonised in obtaining a metric ton of ammonia in the form of pure spirit or sulphate thus amounts to about 315 tons, or to 331 tons if allowance is made for a loss of 5 per cent, of the ammonia during the conversion operations. The equivalent figures per metric ton of combined nitrogen in the form of ammonia or ammonium sulphate are 382 tons and 402 tons respectively.The Arc Process.In the case of an arc furnace installation of large size, the whole of the process requirements as regards evaporation, concentration, etc., are met by the utili-sation of the waste heat of the arc furnace gases ^Section III.), so that no fuel is needed.f he Haher Process. .Apart from the power requirements dealt with in Table TV (p. 318), the main item to be considered in connection with the Haber process is the quantity of fuel required for the manufacture of the necessary hydrogen by one or other of the water-gas processes referred to in Section IV.Since the water-gas catalytic process appears to be the most economical in respect of fuel require-ments, an attempt may be made to estimate the approximate consumption of fuel involved in manu-facturing hydrogen by this method. It is claimed, for example, that the production of a definite volume of hydrogen only necessitates the employment of LI volumes of water-gas as compared with from 2 to 4 volumes of water-gas in the case of other processes. As, however, precise information is not available concerning the commercial operation of the catalytic process, it will be assumed for the purposes of the present calculation that 1-5 volumes of &quot;water-gas are employed for every volume of hydrogen produced.The water-gas is mixed with, say, three times its volume of steam and passed over a catalyst at a temperature of about 400s to 5000 0. (Section IV.). In practice it is probable that the catalytic stage can be made self-supporting from the thermal point of view by the employment of efficient regenerative arrangements for utilising the sensible heat of the water-gas and of the converted gas mixture. Assuming this to be the case, the fuel requirements would be approximately as follows: On an average, the production of 1,000 cu, ft. of &quot;blue&quot; water-gas from coke fuel involves the con-sumption of 30 to 34 lb. of coke in the producer, and 12 to 15 lb. of coke for raising the necessary steam. About 2,250 cu. ft. of air at a pressure of 20 in. of water have to be supplied to the producer for every 1,000 cu. ft. of water-gas made, the power requirements of the fan in the case of a plant making 200,000 cu. ft. of water-gas per day amounting to 14 - 5 b.h.p. The water-gas contains approximately 50 per cent, of hydrogen and 40 per cent, of carbon monoxide, ,and has a calorific value (nett) of about 290 B.Th,U. per cubic foot. Taking the upper values of the above figures and neglecting the power requirements which have already been dealt with, every 1,000 cu, ft. of water-gas produced necessitates the consumption of 49 lb. of coke, corresponding to 1 - 5 X 49 = 73 - 5 lb. per 1,000 cu. ft. of hydrogen.The steam required for the catalytic stage amounts to, say, 3,000 cu. ft. per 1,000 cu. ft. of water-gas used, or 4,500 cu. ft. per 1,000 cu. ft. of hydrogen produced. Since 1 lb. of dry saturated steam at 100o 0. and atmospheric pressure occupies 26 *79 cu. ft., the steam requirements represent the evaporation of 4,500-^26*79 = 168 lb. of water. Taking a realised figure for the evaporative capacity of coke-fired boilers, namely, 9 lb.of steam per lb. of coke utilised, the catalytic stage necessitates the consumption of 168 4- 9 sz 18- 66 lb. of coke. The total quantity of coke consumed per 1,000 cu. ft. of hydrogen produced thus amounts to approximately 92- 2 lb.Allowing for losses during the synthesis of ammonia; 77,000 cu, ft. of hydrogen are required for the manu-facture of a metric ton of ammonia (Section IV.), corresponding to the consumption of 92-2 x 77 = 7,099 lb. or 3&apos; 17 tons of coke. The equivalent quantity of fuel for the production of a metric ton of combined nitrogen in the form of ammonia amounts to 3- 85 tons. These figures take no account of certain minor re-quirements involved during the purification of the hydrogen.The Cyanamide Process.The information given below summarises the evidence available as to the fuel required in the carbide-cyanamide stages of the process, and also in the conversion of cyanamide into ammonia and ammonium sulphateCarbide-Cyanamide. The manufacture of a metric ton of carbide involves the consumption of about 620 kg. of anthracite, and the use of about 230 kg. of coal for roasting limestone to produce the necessary amount of lime for the carbide melt (Section V.), making a total of 850 kg. of fuel.The quantity of carbide required for fixing a metric ton of nitrogen in the form of cyanamide by the con-tinuous process is 3&apos; 625 metric tons (Section V.). The total consumption of anthracite and coal thus amounts to 3-625 X 850 ^ 3,081 kg. or, say, 3 long tons per metric ton of combined nitrogen in the form of 5 metric tons of cyanamide (20 per cent. N.).According to the practice at Odda (Engineering, 1914, Vol. 98, p, 352). the waste gases from the carbide furnaces are utilised for roasting the limestone, and assuming that the employment of coal were thus obviated, the total requirements for anthracite alone would amount to 3-625 x 620 zz\ 2,247 kg., or 2-2 long tons per metric ton of nitrogen fixed. These figures take no account of the small quantities of carbon electrodes consumed in the carbide and cyanamide-mide stages.Ammonia from Cyanamide.  With regard to the conversion of the cyanamide into ammonia, it has been stated that the amount of steam required is 60 per cent, of the weight of cyanamide used (Landis, Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, 1916, Vol. 8, No, 2). The production of a metric ton of ammonia from cyanamide containing 20 per cent, of nitrogen, allowing for a loss of 5 per cent, of nitrogen during the conversion, would entail the ixse of 4-33 metric tons of cyanamide, and thus of about 5,750 lb. of steam. Taking the evaporative capacity of coal-fired boilers at 8 lb. of steajn per lb. of coal, the fuel requirements would amount to approximately 720 lb., or 0-32 long ton of coal per metric ton of ammonia recovered, corresponding to 0*39 ton of coal per metric ton of combined nitrogen obtained in the form of ammonia.Upon the basis of the figures given above, the quantity of anthracite and coal used in the manufacture of the cyanamide required for obtaining a metric ton of ammonia nitrogen amounts to 3-15 tons. The overall process requirements for the carbide-cyanamide and ammonia stages thus involve the consumption of 3 - 54 tons of fuel per metric ton of nitrogen recovered as ammonia.Ammonium Sulphate via Cyanamide.   Evidence which has come before the Sub-Committee relating to the manufacture of ammonium sulphate from cyanamide indicates that the fuel required for the conversion and sulphate stages, but exclusive of that involved in the production of the necessary sulphuric acid, amounts to about 1*56 to 1-63 long tons per metric toi. of ammonia recovered in the form of sulphate. The equivalent requirements per metric ton of combined nitrogen in the form of sulphate are 1 - 9 to 1 - 98 tons. According to the figures given, the overall losses of nitrogen in the conversion and sulphate stages are of the order of 6 to 9 per cent., and allowance is made for these losses in the fuel requirements specified above.
Taking account of the anthracite and coal used in the manufacture of the necessary quantities of cyanamide-niide, the overall process requirements for the carbide-cyanamide, ammonia and sulphate stages involve the consumption of 5-1 to 5 - 3 tons of fuel per metric ton of nitrogen recovered as ammonium sulphate. No allowance is made in these figures for the fuel used in making the sulphuric acid.The Ammonia Oxidation Process.The fuel requirements for the chemical operations will depend upon the source of the ammonia that is employed, and an example may be given based upon the assumed employment of crude gasworks liquor.Taking the losses in the oxidation process at 10 per cent., every metric ton of HNO;i (calculated as 100 per cent.) obtained in the form of dilute acid involves the utilisation of 0-3 metric ton of NH:i (Section VII.). Upon the basis of the figures pre-viously given in connection with the preparation of pure ammonia spirit, the fuel requirements per metric ton of HN03 would amount to 0-3 x-4* 6=1 *38 tons, equivalent to 4-5 xl&apos;38^6&apos;2 tons of fuel per metric ton of combined nitrogen recovered in the form of dilute nitric acid.In the case of the ammonia oxidation process being installed in connection with a factory for producing synthetic ammonia by the Haber or cyanamide pro-cesses, the overall fuel requirements for the process operations can be deduced from the above and previous i figures.Taking the case in which cyanamide is purchased from an external factory and converted into ammonia at the oxidation plant, the total fuel requirements would amount to 0-3x0-32x4*5 = 0-43. ton per metric ton of combined nitrogen obtained in the form of dilute nitric acid.Reliable evidence as to the fuel requirements for concentrating the dilute acid is not available to the Sub-Committee.The Hausser Process.The figure taken (Section IX.) for the yield of nitric acid when using the stationary type of bomb was135 gms. of HN03 (calculated as 100 per cent.) per cu. m, of coke-oven gas having a calorific value (nett) of 4,004 kg. cals per cu. m. (450 B.Th.U. per cu. ft.). Upon this basis, the production of a metric ton of HNO;, (calculated as 100 per cent.) in the form of dilute acid represents the utilisation of about 261,600 cu. ft. of gas, having a total calorific value of 117,700,000 B.Th,U.Assuming the coke-oven gas had to be diverted from other uses, and that coal having a calorific value of 12,500 B.Th,U. per lb. had to he employed in its stead, the fuel requirements of the Hausser plant would be equivalent to 18-9 tons of coal per metric ton of nitrogen fixed in the form of dilute nitric acid.With regard to the quantity of coal that would have to be coked in the ovens themselves to provide the necessary gas, it must be remembered that of every 11,500 cu. ft. obtained per ton of coal car-bonised, only 40 per cent, is available for external purposes after the requirements of the ovens and by-product recovery plant have been met. (Section IX.) As the quantity of surplus gas needed for the recovery of a metric ton of combined nitrogen by the Hausser process amounts to 4-5 x 261,600 - 1,177,200 cu. ft., it would be necessary to carbonise about 256 tons of coal to produce sufficient surplus gas for the purpose.Other Processes.The fuel requirements of other fixation processes, such as the cyanide processes (Section X.) and the Serpek process (Section XL), are not sufficiently well established to justify detailed consideration.The table below summarises the figures given above for the fuel requirements of the different process operations expressed in terms of long tons.OVERALL FUEL REQUIREMENTS.The table opposite sets out the quantities of fuel required for the fixation or recovery of a metric ton of combined nitrogen by the different synthetic processes inclusive of power requirements and of the require-ments of the chemical stages.

The arc process stands at a marked disadvant-age when considered merely from the standpoint of fuel consumption.A comparison between the synthetic and non-synthetic processes shows that the latter yield the higher return of combined nitrogen per ton of fuel when the requirements involved in the production of the raw materials themselves are disregarded.The substantial reduction in the yield of combined nitrogen per ton of fuel in the case of gas-fired steam turbo-electric power plants as compared with the yieldin the case of direct coal-fired plants is due to the largely increased fuel consumption in the former case consequent upon the low overall thermal efliciency of the gasification operations,LOSSES AND POSSIBLE YIELD OF BY-PRODUCT NITROGEN FROM COAL UTILISED.The direct combustion of coal for power production involves the total loss of the combined nitrogen con-tained in it, whereas the conversion of the coal into power-gas enables a large percentage of the nitrogen to be recovered as a by-product in the form of ammonia or ammonium sulphate.The losses or possible yield of by-product nitrogen consequent upon the employment of fuel in various ways for the production of power for nitrogen fixation will now be considered, the following assumptions being made, namely: (a) That the average nitrogen content of coal used for the direct firing of boilers amounts to 1-2 per cent.(ft) That the average nitrogen content of coal utilised for the production of power-gas with by-product recovery amounts to 1 -;5 per cent.(e) That it is possible to recover 70 per cent, of the combined nitrogen contained in the coal by methods involving complete gasification alone, or low temperature carbonisation followed by gasification of the resulting coke.From the above assumptions it follows that the utilisation of a ton (1,016 kg.) of coal for direct firing represents the loss or possible recovery of 8-53 kg. of by-product nitrogen, equivalent to approximately 41 - 5 kg. of ammonium sulphate (25 per cent. NH3), whereas the possible yield from coal of the quality specified for making power-gas amounts to 9-24 kg. of by-product nitrogen, equivalent to approximately 44-9 kg. of ammonium sulphate (25 per cent. NH3).Applying these figures to the power requirements of the synthetic processes as given in Table IV., the following quantities of by-product nitrogen would be lost or recoverable from the coal needed for the fixation of a metric ton of combined nitrogen by the processes themselves.TABLE IX.-BY-PRODUCT NITROGEN LOST OR RECOVERABLE PER METRIC TON OF NITROGEN FIXED BY SYNTHETIC PROCESSES.

The large quantities of by-product nitrogen recoverable are due to the low overall thermal efficiency of coal-gasification systems and the consequent high figures for coal consumption, as shown in Table IV.For every metric ton of synthetic nitrogen fixed at a coal-fired power station, the realisable nitrogen from an equivalent gas-fired power station will be greater owing to the additional by-product nitrogen recover-able. If the processes are compared from the point of view of the realisable nitrogen per ton of coal consumed for power purposes, their relative positions are shown in the following table.

This apparent anomaly is due to the fact that a ton of coal is more effective from the power point of view in fixing synthetic nitrogen than from the by-product nitrogen point of view. On account of the low overall thermal efficiency of gasification systems, and the consequent increase in the coal consumption per unit output of power, the effect of gasification is to lower, the total yield of nitrogen per ton of coal.The above considerations, however, only deal with one aspect of gasification systems in relation to the nitrogen problem, and take no account of other im-portant aspects such as the possible reduction in ,the cost of generating , electrical energy, as compared with the cost by direct coal-firing, and the recovery of other by-products of national importance. These aspects are dealt with in a previous Appendix (Appendix IV.)
