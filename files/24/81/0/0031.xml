From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department, hth June 1919. Priority A.   Clear the line.Foreign Secret. Your telegram of 2nd June. Afghanistan. His Majesty&apos;s Government would have preferred to have an opportunity of considering draft of your reply to Amairullah before actual despatch. Although it is directly concerned with the terms of armistice only, in effect it outlines and delimits conditions of peace, and the decision of the latter must necessarily rest with 11 is Majesty&apos;s Government. We, share your desire for early termination of hostilities, but we should have preferred to conch last three paragraphs of Your Excellency&apos;s letter in language which would have more effectively recognised gravity of Amir&apos;s conduct and shown less willingness to condone an offence for which there can be no excuse. We should have feared that unexpected clemency might he mistaken for conscious weakness. Terms of armistice also seem to us open to criticism in certain particulars. It is understood, however, that your letter has actually issued, and in these circurn-stances there is nothing for it but to await Amir&apos;s reply. But His Majesty&apos;s Government wish to make it clear that they expect to be fully consulted about terms of final settlement, and that in meantime nothing further should he said or done that would limit our freedom to impose such conditions on Afghan Government or exact such reparation from it as may be deemed desirable.
