&quot;His Document fs theif/fXT1&apos;&quot;F?*o?/i Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, lo Secretary pf Statefor India, 1st&apos;June 1.919.-- - . (deceived 2nd.)    \ , ......:&apos;    Clear the line.78(5 8, Secret, Afghanistan. - Following is translation of AmlFs letter, as telegraphed Iron) Peshawar:-.&quot; liny it he known 1 (/friendly minds of bis&apos;illustrious&apos;&apos; Excellency, my friend Mis Excellency the Viceroy and Govcruor-Oeueral of India of the Government of Great Britain.   While friendly.communications were pasting between our two exalted Governments and our trusted; envoy Sardar Resilient,, the exalted &quot;Abdur Rahman was deputed to your Court for strengthening relations and raising high the connections, certain&apos; unpleasant events happened owing lo some misunderstanding.   These led to strain of relations and resulted m bloodshed between \\$.   Consequently I was obliged by considerations of humanity and obligation rights of civilisation to use my endeavours as far as possible to prevent bloodshed &quot;amongst mankind, which is&quot;a sign of barbarity, and to pay no heed to personal slight which has been caused from your side.   Firstly, it is&apos;necessary to. offer certain explanations of misunderstanding which has. occurred.   At, the time our envoy arrived at Peshawar he could only be summoned to Simla after much delay owing to disturbances and disorders which had occurred in that country.   These disturbances and disorders had created such a panic that railways and telegraph lines between Simla and Peshawar were cut, though only temporarily, and much bloodshed and disorder occurred so that delay occurred departure of our envoy, perhaps due to these causes, while at Peshawar itself  Muhammadans and Hindus who have intercourse with Muhammadans and Hindus ol our country held meetings and made demonstrations to such an extent that news of such an event compelled us to despatch number of troops to mark and control frontiers of our  own  country   under  the   orders   and   Commands of   certain trusted officers of ours, so that they might inspect and protect line of frontiers.   Sipah $alar Saleh Mohameci Khan,, who was deputed, to Eastern frontier of our country, started to make certain defensive preparations as precautionary measures.   Since the feelings of our frontier and trans-frontier hillmen had been excited, these preparations  appeared to  be necessary.   The other cause of these preparations was that on the 8th Shaban 1337 Hijra Sagu 9th May 1.919, your aeroplanes made a flight into the air of our country with certain threats, and the reply to our letter was also delayed.   I am very sorry that certain undesirable events also occurred on both sides in the meantime which very nearly caused a breach of old friendship of long years past between you-and us.   As we had given orders to our Commandant to inspect and protect the frontier he considered certain points as included in his own territory according to the map and plan which he had in his possession and proceeded to carry on some digging as a precautionary measure.   Without the exchange of any written communication on the face of the earth between Kamrups on subject matters came to such a pass that aerial operations resulted in bomb throwing, which wounded our Commander-in-Chief.   Tour troops, moreover, violated our territory.   We were therefore obliged to issue general order declaring war. In Kabul and surroundings of Kabul the Ulemas Saiad and Sheikhs, everyone of whom commanded influence amongst thousands of Afghan Mussalmans, assembled and created excitement.- In the meantime&apos;our Envoy Abdur Rahman, who was permitted by you to come away, reached Kabul, and it became quite clear from  his  statements  and explanations  that  the Foreign   Secretary Of  high  dignity  discussed  with him  with  great emphasis the necessity of desisting from Avar, which was  injurious, and had clearly asked that hostilities should be stopped.   It became apparent that  events  and, movements which had taken place ,were accidental   and   undesirable.    Consequently   the   duties   of   humanity made it necessary before anything that an attempt should be made
to put matters right. Accordingly we put off the publications of the proclamations of a holy war by the Islamic Sheikhs of: Afghanistan, and referred matter to the Exalted National Council who decided that our envoy should he sent again to your Exalted Side to offer explanations and to stop fighting and bloodshed. . A day had&apos; hardly elapsed after the departure of Our envoy from your camp when one of your aeroplanes Hew over Kabul and bombed our Royal Palace,, thereby causing . great excitement and panic among our loyal people. The machines bombed the sacred mausoleum of my great grandfather His Majesty Amir Abdul Rahman Khan, may he rest in peace between, and certain other quarters were bombed. Similarly at Jelalabad also the sacred grave, of my revered father, His Majesty Siraj III Millat Wadden, on whom be peace between, who discharged the obliga-tions of friendship toward you to the extreme during his lifetime, and, many other favourite buildings in our official quarter and in unprotected town were bombed. It is a matter for great regret that the throwing of bombs by Zeppelins on London was denounced as a most savage act and the bombardment of places of worship and sacred spots was considered a most abpminable operation, while now we see with &quot;our eyes that such operations-were a habit which is prevalent amongst all civilised people of the West&quot;. Notwithstanding this, it is not our desire that the&quot; century-old friendship between you and us should be broken and that bloodshed should occur between us which would again lead to perpetual enmity, hatred and malice between these two nations in such a way that it would be impossible to extinguish these feelings, because once a nation prepares for death and thirsts for revenge,&quot; it becomes impossible to restrain it. In this respect, singular proof of our Royal good intentions is the despatch of this friendly letter to Your Excellency. At the same time we have sent our Royal commands to our commandant to suspend move-ments of troops in different directions and to stop (.? group omitted) and a certified copy of said firmans is forwarded herewith for Your Excellency&apos;s perusal. Relying on this I state to Your Excellency with great sincerity intention that our sublime Government has never had anv idea of severing friendly relations with illustrious Government of Great Britain, is in no case whatever desirous of upsetting old obligations and old relations. Oil the&apos; contrary it is desirous of honourable and dignified peace that may be advantageous to both parties at present and in the future enable Afghanistan to acquire honourable and dignified existence. And it is possible to settle the question in this manner that some personage on behalf of your illustrious Government and some on behalf of our sublime Government may be selected and nominated to assemble at Landi Kotal or Peshawar to discuss the matter and to conclude an honourable and dignified peace for both parties. The earlier action is taken in this affair the better it will be for both parties. For the rest may the days of friendship endure for ever. Dated 28th May 1919.-Amir Amanulla,&quot;Enclosure : &quot; May it be known to our Exalted and (corrupt group) brother Dost Muhammad Khan (corrupt group) Naib Salar Ali Jan. According to information received by us in these days from the Exalted Government of India it appears that fighting has taken place between the troops of the two sides owing to some misunderstanding. You should suspend hostilities until the door of discussion and communication is opened. As we had no intention of fighting with this old friend (corrupt group) and were obliged to take defensive measures, now that he is also desirous of peace we order and.command you to keep back your regular troops, tribes, Mujahidin and Ghazi, for whom we are liable to be responsible with your masterly effort and wait for further orders. Von should, however, keep in view defensive and offensive preparations. To the result of discussion between Your Sublime Government illustrious British Government is the conclusion of peace or otherwise I shall inform you. That is to say you should suspend action until further orders. Dated 27th May 1919.  Amir Amanulla.&quot;
