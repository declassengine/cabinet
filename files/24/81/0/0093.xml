From, Viceroy, Foreign Department&apos;, \.5tk-June 1919.  1 1 * &quot;;(Received Kith June&apos;1919.). &apos; &quot; ,(dear tlie line. -.   877 S.&apos; Bee ret.   Afghanistan.   Following&apos;from lioos-Keppel dated loth June:-&quot;Numbers of Afridis from southern Waziristan Militia and northern Waziristan Militia&apos;who have arrived at Tirah with rifles and loot are describing modifications in the Afridi evacuation of &quot;Wano Agency and Upper (?

Interiialsituation iinprpved.&apos;&apos; &apos;&quot;.      ^     &apos;\ . j. Following from Baluchistan dated 13th June :      r : .; rr*&quot;1. On afternoon of 11th -June one Mullah Nek Miillammed&apos; Kandahari, Tdniierly refugee at Quetta reached Ohaman with Abduls reply to   Sou frolics&quot;&apos; lettei1;&apos;&quot;&apos; communicating armistice terms.: Emissary was also charged with important verbal explanation  of  Abd&apos;ul&apos;s  real views; and was  inimediately brought by l(corrupt&apos; group), to Quetta, where he presented letter to Soufront, and was interviewed by; SoufrOnt and me last night and this morning.   Gist of military portion of letter is that Abdul is most anxious to avoid aggressive &quot;action, and has ordered his regular troops and tribesmen not to fire a single shot, but capture of Baldak lias aroused old resentments, but (? and) new people are flocking to Afghan standard daily, all of whom cannot be made immediately acquainted with his orders not to fire.   He therefore hopes that aeroplanes will not fly, and that General will trust to him to restrain his people.   There will be no attack without Amir&apos;s order, but he cannot manage to keep them back behind  20  miles  limit  suggested.   Moreover, for so long as British occupy fort of Baldak he cannot withdraw troops and tribesmen, since they would not ohey his orders.   As soon as Baldak is evacuated lie will demonstrate only a small body of troops on the (corrupt group), and will feel himself free to negotiate.   He had already issued (? flying) orders to Farrah and Chakansur to avoid aggression.   As to Viceroy&apos;s conditions for armistice Abdul has received copy from Amir, and has written reply to Amir which he cannot (corrupt group).   Full acceptance or rejection of these conditions is right of the Amir alone.   Remainder of letter deals in wild political speculations as to danger to Britain and Afghanistan of Russia combined with Germany, Austria, Turkey, Bulgaria, and ultimate (? destruction of the) people, and the book by internecine warfare which will enable the idolatrous powers of China and Japan to dominate the world.   Verbal message sent by Abdul is that he himself is virtual ruler of Afghanistan, and Amir will follow his advice regarding acceptance of armistice conditions and all other matters.    His position is very difficult, and he looks to us to get him out of it.   Troops and tribesmen having been assembled on this front and filled  with fanatical and  patriotic spirit he dare not order them to retire without definite settlement, or leave  them and go to Kabul or elsewhere to negotiate.    Apparently he   has   advised   Amir that terms of armistice cannot be enforced since tribesmen will not carry them out without first obtaining definite assurance against annexation or punishment, and without some proper orders which excuse of necessity of combating Bolshevism will  provide.    What  he asks  for is  early  announcement  of full forgiveness to Afghanistan from Britain without encouraging terms of frontier rectifications or indemnities on ostensible grounds that Bolshevist menace to Afghanistan is so great that Britain must treat her with generosity Avhatever may have been her fault aud fault of Amir for fear she should succumb entirely to Bolshevism and cease to be barrier for India.   If Government of India will not adopt this suggestion and persist in presenting formally demands regarding armistice conditions Abdul evidently thinks or wishes us to believe there is no chance of peace,   (r AniiFs) life is threatened by tribesmen and Abdul even fears for his own safety if he does not play up to their patriotic sentiments.&quot; 2. Bruce has returned from Musakhel reports Sheranni sustained fairly heavy casualties in attack on Musakhel of 11th June. Many were dressed in khaki. None of Musakhel tribe seem to have joined them, and all Musakhel Maliks now profess loyal sentiments. There is now every hope that disorder wall be confined to Sheranni country.&quot;Following from Meshed, dated 13th June&quot;Herat quiet up to (? 7th) June. Notice of Jehad was read after Friday prayers on 30th May and received with applause much activity in purchasing arms and
HI  &quot; &apos;    31. lift  .;; &apos;ammunition and rifle practice by the general -public has since been observed. Commander of Afghan force at Kafir Kila informs Herat that British force at Karez has been withdrawn, and that no further reinforcements need be sent to him. Much dissension exists between various regiments in Herat, and, there is said to be general enmity between Herat and Kabul garrisons, Fourteen J amshedis prisoners were brought into Herat on 3rd June, but General ^ateh Mohammed Khan (? word omitted) them to go to (? p,la,ce omitted) saying tjiey &apos;were not guilty. This.was possibly to placate their leader. It is reported in the city that there are. rnany Bolsheviks on Ijtussian frontier who are ready to help Afghans to give them arms and ammuhitipn. Risaldar Yar Mohammad Khan writes that Russian officers at Sheikh Junaid invited him to come over and occupy it, offering him help ih arms,and wen.
