In the event of the Amir accepting the proposals for negotiations at Rawalpindi, I have selected Grant, Foreign Secretary, as British representative, with Maffey as Political Adviser. It might strengthen his position, and both impress and gratify Amir if Grant were given a Royal Commission on lines of one issued to McMahon in 1913 for Tibet negotiations. See Foreign Office letter dated 13th August 1913, 31252/13. If you agree, please arrange and despatch as soon as possible. I shall telegraph shortly our proposals for conduct of the negotiations and proposed substance of peace terms and new treaty.
