From Viceroy, 6th June 1919. (Received .10.55 a.m.)809 S. Secret. Afghanistan. Following I from Roos-Keppel, dated 3rd June : &quot;Result of Afridi jirga at Bagli on Friday was that Afridis discussed three important points in full tribal jirga. First was origin and authorship of looting at Jalalabad and consequent breach with Afghans at a critical time. Kazi Mir (of) Haiclar and others, who were suspected of having engineered looting and of being in our pay, cleared themselves on oath and matter was settled. Second point was, recovery of rifles taken by Afridi deserters from Khyber Rifles, and jirga decided that in the interests of Africlis generally it. was (? necessary that) these rifles should bb returned to Political Agent, Khyber. Warnings were sent to all deserters in Tirah forbidding them to dispose of the rifles taken under penalty of tribal punishment, and arrangements were made to recover them from deserters as rapidly as possible. Third point discussed was general future policy of Africlis, and jirga decided that another deputation should be sent to Jalalabad to ascertain Amir&apos;s intentions, and that tribe should come to no definite decision until return of this jirga. This last move was partly to gain time and partly because Afridis are genuinely puzzled at constant rumours of peace overtures from Amir, also propaganda that Amir wishes for peace which English refuse to grant and simultaneous distribution of more arms in Kabul and more Fatwas of Jehad in Tirah with Amirs sanction.&quot;It is evident that responsible leaders of the tribe who have succeeded in keeping Afridis out of war up to now, will endeavour to do so as long as possible.&quot;In this connection please see our telegram No. 783 S. of 1st June.Following from Baluchistan, dated 3rd June: &quot; Baluchistan Sherannis now appear definitely -affected by movement in North-West Frontier Province, as Manikhwa post was attacked last night and wire between it and Sandeman cut. Garrison and civil inhabitants of Sandeman have gone within perimeter, but militia not being trusted, remain outside. Sandeman is being-reinforced, and some troops are going to Murgha with Harris as Political Officer. All the rest of Baluchistan quiet. Very friendly messages received from all principal Sardars of Persian Baluchistan on Mekran border deploring Amir&apos;s conduct. 200 Indian officers and men, Zhob militia, out of a total of 1,259, have deserted. Informer who left Kandahar 29th May, reports much excitement over fall of Baldak, and large gathering of the tribesmen of the Sturi Khel, who are receiving Government rations and rifles, are awaiting arrival of Abdul Kuddus before attacking British. Abdul Kuddus was somewhere between Kelat-i-Ghilzai and Kandahar. Informer passed through large encampment of troops (? ready) at (corrupt group).&quot;
