4 Vc Mm&apos;JU      ft       Ngravity   of   BEER.W? 1( :jiemorawlum by the pood controller.I have read Mr * Fisher&apos;s memorandum sotting forth the result of our interview with the representatives of the Brewers1 Society on the 12th June,,   Tlie 3ense of the mee ting was that it would he plainly unfair that the additional &quot;burden should fall wholly upon the brewers who mainly or entirely brewed industrial beer? while the brewers of high gravity beer were wholly exempt.I understand that the draft Report of the Technical Advisory Committee to the Liquor Restrictions Committee of the Cabinet favours the abolition of all Government control of gravity,   I think that this Report should be considered before a conclusion is reached.My own view is that any change now made should be expressed to continue until next Budget.   The change which I favour is to raise the gravity in each category 40 and raise the permitted average gravity a like number of degrees.    I understand that this solution would be accepted by the Trade notwithstanding that it would involve them in a loss of more than double that inflicted by the 10/- duty.geo. h. roberts.Ministry of Pood, 17th June, 1919,
