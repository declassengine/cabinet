It is too early yet to know whether the risings in different parts of Hungary will be put down by the Communist Government.   There in reason to think that if any invitation to visit Paris is given to the Communists at Budapest the result may be disastrous; the latest reports.from Hungary show that the people are eagerly awaiting some sort of invitation from without and if the Allies appear in any way to recognise the existing government they will be plunged into disaster.The latest reports from Faris show that the Government isin no anxiety about the issue of the present strike movement,and the Socialists themselves are foreseeing impending failure; their great hopes lie in the next strike.The worst orisia in Canada appears to have passed.   There is apparently evidence showing that the notorious Industrial Workers of the V/orld seoretly promoted the strikes and are alsobehind/
behind the Anarchist bomb outrages In tho Eastern States. The result has been thoroughly to alarm the publio, and there are indications that there will be panic legislation both in Canada and the United States to restrict immigration and to punish revolutionaries.   The State Department has been furnished with evidence from this Offioe that Ludwig Martens, the leader of the Bolsheviks in the United States, is, by his own declaration, a German.  He is to be dealt with,Pan-lslamio agitation, combined with Bolshevism, is strong in Central Asiaj it takes, of course, the form of attacking the British Empire.   India is quiet.   In Egypt there is a movement for a national strike as a Nationalist demonstration.   With one or two exceptions, the charges of oruelty made against British troops are without foundation.There is a strong Socialist movement in North Italy against the use of Italian ships to carry munitions to Russia.  Aooording to Reuter, a general strike was to be declared at Naples early this morning.In Germany the Government has suffioient foroe for dealing with any strike,disturbances.   The only official    1 recognition accorded to the reoently formed German Polios Unions is that they arc allowed to exist.    There is agitation at Hamburg and Konlgsberg in favour of union with Russia. The belief is wide-spread in Germany that war with Poland is inevitable, whatever happens at Versailles; there is a continuous movement of German troops towards the Polish frontier.
IS?The French Government are said to take, a serious view of. the strike situation.   Socialistic circles, however, hold the movement to ho doomed to failure. The permanent Administrative Committee of the Socialist Party are,endeavouring to secure the sympathy of the Frenoh peasantry.The Miners&apos; 3yndioate has determined to unite itself with the syndioates of merchant Seamen and Railway Workers. &apos;&quot;,,,  -        The Increase in the Annual&quot;Budget and the. profiteering in. food continue to be the principal subjects of discussion. ..The -morale of the. Army on the whole remains good.The food supply in Beigium is.improving and the sugar rationi has been increased.   Though large stocks of i i    goods are held up at Antwerp by wholesale houses,probably for trado&apos; with Germany when restrictions have . been removed&apos;,&apos; there have not been quite so many strikes during th&amp; week.    Brussels has resumed its pre-war aspect, building is in progress, and there, is a general, growing air of prosperity.    The exohange, however, is very low (about 32 franos to the pound).There has been a re-grouping of Parties;   the . Cathollo Party, having taken alarm, is in a conciliatory mood, and there is a tendenoy for the various Bourgeois elements in.the&apos;different Parties to coalesce against the Sooialists.    The Walloon element in the Socialist Party favours the idea of an alliance with France, while the Flemish element seeks a rapprochement with Holland.There are signs that aB soon as maohinery and raw material are available there will be a vary rapid return. to prosperity. iSWITZERLAND/
In addition to &quot;theaisuai:.$exmar.-. propaganda, the-&quot;Gaeiio-Amerioan&quot; and the Journal of the IMependonoe Party of South Afrioa have been on sale in. G-snera.Ramsay MACDONMiD , Sydney BUXTQN. and LCNGI7ET have so. far failed in their attempt to persuade the, Swiss socialists to, join the second International.It is now known, that. Robert MINOR end Philips PRIcJ who were in. Dusscldorf during February and Maroh, have been, advising the German. Bolsheviks how to operate against British and American troops. MINOR was arrest in Paris by the French Authorities on June 8th and takej to Coblenz to be handed over to the Americans, probably for trial by Court Martial.. There is reason to belie? that this arrest will: cause some stir, as, MINOR was in, possession of an offioial pass as an aooredited Peace Conference journalist. Rillips PRICE is probably still in. Germany and, as there is now believed to be sufficiej evidenoe for putting him on his trial, it is unlikely that he will venture to pass the frontier.AUSTRIAThe position, in. Austria is disquieting.    The Peao Terms are having a very depressing effeoit, and the successes,of the Hungarian Red Army mayy, *it is thought 1 provoke a Communist outbreak.    The local conditions very-much favour Bolshevik-propaganda at the moment, fo: German-Austria has not a single ooal mine left, and the Polish and Czech Governments both refuae to export ooal There is consequently a very real danger of a general strike.At/
1S8At a meeting of tho Soldiers1 Councils in Vienna on June 5th, it was decided that the time had oome to adopt a definitely Communist policy.   The Volkswehr is beginning to support the Communists, who are provided with arms and ammunition.MIA KJM claims to have driven a wedge- between the Czeohs and the Roumanians and apparently now contemplates extensive operations against the Czechs in Slovakia.A later report States that the Caeohs have already evacuated Pressburg and that Soviet rule is being proclaimed in the reconquered country as the advance proceeds.The Frenoh General MITTBKHAUSEN, with his staff, has assumed oommand of the C2eoho-Slovak troops in Slovakia.Another report from Budapest states that the Hungarian Soviet Government has declared its readiness to retire in favour of a Government headed by H, GARANIS, whqfcelonged to the Right Wing of the Social Democratic Party and was Minister of Commerce in Count KAROtiY^s Cabinet.   The new Cabinet would be formed in agreement with&apos; the SZEGEDXN Government.   This development is due to the fact that the Communist Party realises that the majority of the workmen in Budapest is against it,A report, which has been received from two separate sources, indicates that a strong entente exists between a large Italian Mission and the Soviet Government in Budapest.   It is alleged, that Italy has sent not only large quantities of food to Hungary but also arms and *munitions/
munitions for the fiungariaiTKed Army.   There appears to he no doubt that there i3 much smuggling across the Serbian frontier. /The Wireless Press announces that in the province Pesth the Soviet authorities have issued loans to small land holders amounting to 20,000,000 kronen for the purohase of agricultural implements.The strikes continue; 60,000 waiters and tramway workers are on strike in Rome.   There is a threatened strike of Government employees, and a scheme for improv; their conditions of servioe is how under- considerationThough the food situation has somewhat improved, prices are rising.There appears to be an organised anti-Amerioan propaganda in whioh diplomats as well as five or six deteotives of the Seoond Italian Bureau are employed. Some of these persons are now in Paris.THB BALKANS -SerbiaFrom an American source it is reported that unresi is growing in Serbia.   The rank and file are war-wear^ many of them having been under arms for seven years. The present Government is suffering in publio estimati by the treatment of Serbia at the peace Conference.  fl thirds of the population are said to be Socialistic, they- will make the.most of what is regarded as an ina^ to Serbia in the matter of indemnities. GreeceUnfounded rumours have reoently been circulated ^the/
(Foreign)the effect-that Bolshevism is spreading among the Greek Forces in Bessarabia.The Government is conduoting a vigorous anti-Bolshevik oampalgn by means of the Press and special lectures, large funds having been voted for the purpose. Bolshevism is pointed out to the peasants as being anti-Greek and as involving the defilement of the Greek Churohes by burying Jews in the seme ground as Christians.Although there is no definite evidence as yet of Turkish complicity with the disturbances in India, it is significant that three days before the outbreak rumours were circulating among the members of the Pan-Islamio Association in Constantinople to the effect that risings had taken place in India and Egypt, and that the All-India Moslem league was heading the movement.A meeting was held at Lausanne on the 29th April to disouss a movement for dei-ounoing the present Turkish Government as non-representative, and therefore powerless to sign Peace in the name of the Ottoman people,   It was decided to await the publication of the peaoa Terms before beginning work,   There is definite evidenoe that    ! Mohammedans in Switzerland are communicating with those in Turkey through the Turkish Legation at Berne,CZECHO-SLOVAK states the &quot;Bourgeois&quot;, tendency of the Government and the national and consequently non^Bolshevik feeling in the   a Czecho-Slovak States oontinue to oounter-balanoe the Socialist element in tie administration.An anti-Bolshevik tendenoy may be traoed in the      a reported economic boycott against the Jews,  Jewish teachers in the sohools have been dismissed.The/ t
The Czech press emphasises the neoessity for direct territorial connection with OTOO-SLAVIA in order to . seoure an outlet to the Adriatic, Independent of the Western Hungarian line to PII3MB.......mmGeneral YuDBNlTCTi is delaying his advance on Petrograd until the arrival of food supplies for its starving population.  His ouooess and that of DENIKIN in the south have counteracted the temporary Bolshevik suooess against Admiral KOLTCHAK on the Eastern Front.The Bed Terror, which broke out in Petrograd after the proclamation of the state of siege, has resulted in a daily increasing exodus from Russia to Finland.The strong support given by the Lettish Battalions to the Bolshevik Government in Russia, is due to their being practioally foreign mercenaries.Aooording to information recently supplied by an exchanged British prisoner at Moscow, 90$ of the Red toy appear to be against Bolshevism, while in the City itself the faotories and the shops are shut, and there is no gas and very little electricity.A large Bolshevik propaganda sohool for Indians is stated to have been started in Mosoow.KOLTCHAK&apos;s Ministry of Finance announced the receipts of revenue for the first four months of tho current year as being 150 million roubles, - . The Georgian- representatives at the reoently opened Georgian Commercial Agency and Press Bureau at Berne maintain that their Government has effected so many Social Reforms as to eliminate the danger of Bolshevism from Georgia.-POLAND^
-7- 200PQL&amp;ND. - - ;&apos; -1   ; - &apos;  &quot; &quot;       &apos; &apos;The Military suooesBes of the Polish Army against, the Bolsheviks in the Ukraine have served to concentrate . attention for the moment orr the exterior rather than the? interior affairs of the&apos;oountry.  it may be said that, temporarily, Bolshevism is &quot;submerged under the Nationally wave.   It is, however, an ever present, but not an immediate, menace.The Ri^ot Socialists at present outweigh the Bolshevik element, and although KIHLBOM, a well-known Bolshevist leader in Stockholm, is publishing a newspaper entitled &quot;Upplandefolket&quot; for Bolshevik propaganda, Bolshevism in Sweden would appear to depend mainly on unemployment.The Young Democratic Party has decided to adopt an anti-parliamentary and revolutionary attitude.DENMARKThe Bolshevik element In Denmark:, though existent, is feeble, in oharacter. &quot;No Bolshevik money has arrived in the oountry since April 5th.It is stated that&apos;the Copenhagen Zionist Bureau, which is thought to have Bolshevik leanings, is to bo closed.HOLLAND , ,,: ,01 Whilo Bolshevik propaganda a,t.the,German Legation at the;Hague is reported, to. be dead,,.it is said that arms are being smuggled ipto Holland across the German , frontier; oertainly revolvers are being purchased by both the bourgeois and the workers in Amsterdam.VOTKOOP/
M    R    WWYNKOOP is much pleased at the results of the latestmunicipal ^elections, in which six Communists were eleotecli-   for Amsterdam.  He is violently opposed to TROELSTRA, whoa] he. aoouses of working in the interests of the bourgeoisie,There appears,to be general confidence that the Burgerwaoht is equal to any&apos;ball that may be made upon it and knowing this the extremists are unlikely to beoome. violent.FINLAM) ,General -MANNBRHBIM&apos;8 military organisation tends to . consolidate the actual political situation.   The Socialist Party, who have a majority in the Diet, are , ,    not represented in the new Cabinet for the reason that their demands were considered too radical for aooeptanoe . by the other parties.   &apos; .; Bolshevik agents meet with little suooess in thecountry.Pood conditions are much improved.There is not much change in the political situation. The issue of pamphlets and the ventilation of opinion in the Press has been authorised by Royal Deoree, but it is still illegal to hold publio meetings.   The Left Party makes the most of this concession, as betraying a weaknes on the part of the Government.The dispute between agricultural labourers and their employers has been settled.   The labourers have returned to work with ah&quot;&apos;improvement in pay and conditions..   Baroelona is still under military control, and the military censorship of newspapers is maintained.There/*J
&quot;9&quot; 20!tForeign)There is talk of another big strike, and the Sometanesvare organising to assist the Military in dealingtwith any disturbances.   There are rumours that the Government is negotiating for 15,000 rifles with which to arm the Sometan, &apos;-&apos;Two regiments left Madrid on May 29th for Cordova, to deal with riots whioh had broken out in connection with elections, but were believed to be secretly organized :   &apos;   by the Sybdioalists.The Am erloans are said to be making great efforts to.capture the Barcelona market before England and Franoe-can recover^their position.   The Germans are less in evidenoe.- PORTUGAL\- The labour situation is reported to be easier, butthere appears to be a substantial growth of Bolshevism.&apos;   The high oost of living, oombined with the squalid conditions among the poor, form a fruitful soil for propaganda, and, though there may be no great social upheaval;in the near future, the politioal situation of the Government is said to be precarious.EGYPT.The situation remains quiet in Egypt.   The charges of cruelty recently levelled against British troops prove, with one or two possible exceptions, to be without foundation.The censorship of foreign letters shows an appreciation of British lenienoy.The Nationalist Party intend to proclaim a general strike aB soon as the Paris Delegation has definitely failed.   They estimate that the starvation conditionswhioh/

It now take the form of saying that the British are wantonly schemin to destroy and annex the last remaining Mahometan kingdom Afghanistan.The bombing raid which was carried out on Kabul and Jelalabad has had a great effect on the population of - - Afghanistan and has shaken the prestige ox&apos; the Aiair,   Hi troops are reported to be deserting wholesale.There is now further evidenoe about the Indian Bolshevik Propaganda Bureau in Moscow.   It appears that H&quot;. S. SUHRAWARDY, a member of a well-known Caloutta family, who left England for Russia in 1916, is at the b of-the organization and is working in olose touoh with ^LENIN/

He is obtaining his recruits in Switzerland in the hope of being able to send them to Japan, via Stockholm.CANADAAlthough the arrival at Winnipeg of KENNEDY and DUNCAN - the Bolshevist leaders of the reoent strike atSeattle/
