ocnraent is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government,.]FIDENTTAL. Political Intelligence Department,Foreign office.Spain /009.v--..,..:..^ne 3,1919.2Q.T. 745.MEMORANDUM    -onTHE SITUATION IN SPAIN.IN a memorandum issued on the 24th January (Spain /007) an opinion was expressed that Count Romanones, as the only statesman who all through the war had unequivocally taken his side with the Allies, would remain in office till the signature of peace. This prophecy held good for three months, but in the course of April Romanones left office in a somewhat mysterious fashion and was succeeded by Senor Maura, who formed a Cabinet entirely of the Right, with the single exception of his Foreign Minister, Senor Gonzales Hontoria, who is a follower of Romanones and who is probably included owing to the necessity of having Spain&apos;s foreign relations conducted by one who is persona grata to the Allies. Senor Hontoria was lately in Paris as Spain&apos;s representative in the discussions about the League of Nations.The new Cabinet is the seventh which has governed Spain in two years. It is just two years since Romanones fell from office on account of his determination to do something more than make paper protests against the German submarine aggressions; he was partly intrigued out of office by the Marquis of Alhucemas, who succeeded him, and who leads the Left wing of the Liberal Party. He remained in office only a month or two, and was succeeded by the Conservative leader, Senor Dato. The fall of Alhucemas was due to something like a pronunciamiento on the part of the officers at Barcelona, who formed Committees or Juntas and practically overawed the Government. Dato held office until October only, when he in his turn was overthrown because he had failed to give satisfaction to the officers and partly, perhaps, because of the vigorous tone he took up with the German Ambassador on the submarine question. But undoubtedly the dominant part was played by the officers, who resented Dato&apos;s unwillingness to surrender to them in various, matters which were at that time in dispute. He was succeeded by the Marquis of Alhucemas once more, who was obliged to satisfy the army by appointing as War Minister their nominee, Seiior La Cierva. This Ministry carried on a troubled existence, with many resignations and reshuffiings, till March 1918, when La Cierva and the army between them brought matters to a crisis, and it seemed for a moment as if the King might adopt the policy of allowing La Cierva to govern the country on a system which would practically have been that of a military dictatorship. But at the last moment wiser counsels prevailed, and the Ministry of all the Talents and all the ex-Prime Ministers was formed under Senor Maura, the oldest of the ex-Prime Ministers and the leader of a small ultra-conservative faction. This Ministry lasted nearly to the end of the war and undoubtedly saved the country for the moment from a very grave crisis. But it failed to live up to the reputation which was given to it on the strength of language used by the Prime Minister himself, which led to its being called by a foreign observer &apos;&apos; The Ministry of Supremacy of the Civil Government over the Military.&quot; In spite of the firm language of the Prime Minister, it merely damped down the fires of military insubordination; it never stamped them out. It fell in November just as the war came to an end. In spite of the good intentions of Dato, its Foreign Minister, of Romanones, and even, it is believed, of Maura himself, it had failed to take .any vigorous action against German outrages till too late, and was in no position to take any advantage of the Allied victory and the wave of feeling, both Spanish and foreign, which it produced. It fell before violent attacks and opposition in the Cortes, and was followed by a very short-lived Ministry under the inevitable Marquis of Alhucemas with Count Romanones as his Foreign Minister.&apos; This Ministry, however, collapsed in December, on which Romanones ^became Prime Minister and remained Prime Minister until the middle of April, when Maura returned.It has seemed worth while to recapitulate this Ministerial history of Spain during the last two years, in order to illustrate the extreme instability of Spanish Governments and the weakness of the whole system. The greatest weakness of all is shown by the&apos; Cortes. Cabinets are attacked frequently in France, but they seldom or never fall except by- a defeat in the Chamber. Few or none of the.seven [1130V703
Spanish Cabinet crises were occasioned by a defeat or even a threatened defeat in the Cortes. Alhucemas partly fell in July 1917, for fear of meeting the Cortes, and opposition in the Cortes had. a good deal to do, perhaps, with the fall of Maura last November; but Parliament has sat only a very few weeks in the whole two years, and it has, in fact, played a very secondary role in directing the course of events. The dominant powers in the country are, first, the King, who exercises real power through his occasional direct interference, and more by his great power of influencing all the leaders of the old parties; secondly, the leaders of the various political groups, of whom there may now be said to be some six or eight and who are for the most part rather practised players of the game of intrigue and self-interest than standard-bearers of any definite political principle; and thirdly and most important of all, the Army. It has been one or other of these three causes, ministerial intrigue, royal initiative, or military threats, which has caused all the ministerial crises. And outside these three forces there is the revolutionary element taking shape in Republicanism, Socialism and Syndicalism, which have only a small representation in the Cortes but are able to affect the fates of Ministers by creating distrubances out of doors. It is these last two, the Army and Syndicalism, which, working in opposition to each other, have overthrown Count Romanones. In the memorandum of January 20th mention was made of the serious disturbances in different parts of Spain, and of the reports from private sources that a definite revolutionary outbreak would be attempted in April or May. It was pointed out that such reports had been received on previous occasions and had been disproved by the event. This fortunately has again been the case, but different schools of political thought still give the credit to different causes. It is certain that Romanones followed an ultra-liberal policy towards the extremely violent strikes which, as described in the memorandum, took place in Barcelona, where it was necessary for martial law to be proclaimed. Whether his policy was wise or foolish it is probably too early to say, but it is certain that it gave great offence to the military authorities in Barcelona, who were not allowed to deal with the revolutionary elements with all the vigour they desired, although martial law had been proclaimed and the strikers summoned to serve as soldiers. On resistance being organised by the strikers to this mobilisation the Government surrendered to them and allowed the soldiers who had refused to obey orders to go mostly unpunished. The result was such indignation on the part of the officers that they took matters into their own hands and forced the Civil Governor to leave the city, on which he naturally went to Madrid and informed the Prime Minister of the treatment he had received. The Prime Minister, being unable or not being permitted by the King to support him, resigned.There is no doubt that the Cabinet which Maura has formed to take his place is avowedly reactionary. The presence in it of Senor La Cierva, whose intrigues with the officers&apos; committees caused the crisis of March 1918, is notoriously dictated by the army. He has not, indeed, become Minister of War, as he was fifteen months ago, but his presence in the Cabinet is a challenge to all liberal forces in the country and a practically public admission that both the King and the Prime Minister are the prisoners of the army. When Maura took office fifteen months ago he used strong language about the officers&apos; committees, declared for the Civil supremacy, and asserted that he would on no account have any dealings of any kind with La Cierva. He is now the chief of a Cabinet of which La Cierva is the most important member, so much the most important that it is freely said that Maura himself is only a figurehead and that the de facto ruler of Spain is neither the King nor the Prime Minister, but La Cierva.In spite of the efforts of the censorship it has not been possible to disguise either the nature of the crisis or the direct antithesis between the policy followed by Romanones and the policy which the present Cabinet has been formed to carry out. That very phrase &quot;direct antithesis between the two&quot; has been used by Count Romanones, or his organ in the press, the &quot;Diario Universal.&quot; And in a speech Romanones has referred to the contrast between his policy and that of Maura as representing a conflict of principles, his own being the solution of social problems by legal means without having recourse to violence, while those of the new Government allow what Romanones euphemistically calls &quot;energetic measures.&quot; Nor does Romanones conceal the fact that he was driven from office (although the first official announcement endeavoured to say that he resigned because his work was done), and had not voluntarily left it. He has publicly declared, &quot;I did not i leave office of my own free will.&quot; The issue of principle is therefore clear. It appears that Maura hoped at first to meet the Cortes and pass the budget, but this
which had proved impossible for Bomanones naturally proved even more impossible to Maura and Cierva, who were threatened&apos; with opposition which was certain to make the passage of the Finance Bill impossible without recourse to a guillotine closure, to which it was certain the Chamber would not consent.   Maura therefore resigned and obtained on his resignation the grant of dissolution which it was believed at the time the memorandum of March 20th was.written had been granted to Count Romanones.   In fact, it may have been so granted, but when the crisis occurred, both King and Prime Minister may have felt a dissolution impossible or extremely undesirable.   Maura, however, had adopted the policy of &quot;thorough,&quot; and was determined to go through with the elections and obtain a majority with which he could carry on the Government. For that purpose he has no doubt resorted to the old system by which the elections were managed.   In fact, he has gone back altogether upon the system introduced in the beginning of 1918, when the election of mayors was left to the towns themselves and no longer dictated by the Crown, and the general election itself was held under conditions which were at any rate nominally free, and were in fact partially so.   The Maura Government has made a clean sweep of all officials whom it could not trust, and has used all the pressure which it has in its power.  The result of this avowed intention, first to govern in a reactionary spirit, and second to create a Cortes which will support such a method of government, has been to cause a union of the whole Left; and all the sections of it, from the Whigs which follow Romanones  to the Social Republicans, have declared that they will not recognise a Parliament elected on present methods, and will combine to use all methods to make its work impossible.   In reply to this there has been a modified alliance between Dato, the leader of the official, or, as he calls it, Liberal-Conservative, party, and the Prime Minister; but the language used by Senor Dato is by no means cordial, and he lays special stress on the intention of his party to maintain its independence, and treats Maura&apos;s secession from the leader-ship in 1913 as simply the departure of an individual leader, and not at all as a split between two sections of the party.   He adds that while he will act with Senor Maura as far as. possible in the elections, the degree of support his party will give the Government in the future Cortes will be determined by the nature of the measures Senor Maura introduces.    It is obvious that this is a non-committal attitude, which indicates that the jealousy shown before against Senor Maura still exists among the official Conservatives, and Dato evidently distrusts both Maura and La Cierva, whose departure from the party he expressly alluded to as not having prevented its obtaining as large a following as before in the Cortes.   In fact, on the Right, as on the Left, the personal jealousies of the leaders and the absence of real conviction and principle make union difficult; but, as a Liberal paper says, the Left is even more riddled by personal jealousies than the Right.   Alba, for instance, certainly hates Romanones at least as much as he hates Maura, and Alhucemas had not much love for either of his Liberal colleagues.   Besides, the Right has the advantage, at least, of a more definite principle to stand by that of the maintenance of law and order than the Left, which indeed has the general principle of Liberalism and sympathy with modern ideas to unite it, but suffers from the fact that while the maintenance of law and order means one thing plain and obvious, Liberal principles mean a thousand things, out of which endless disputes and divisions constantly arise.This was the situation in which the parties approached the election. As this is being written, the first reports of the result come in. It appears that the Government has not been so completely successful as was expected. The machinery for managing elections does not work in large towns, and it appears that Regionalists have been elected in Barcelona, and, what is more significant, six Republicans in Madrid. The minority will at any rate be large enough and active enough to carry on a vigorous guerrilla opposition to the Government, which is at once reactionary and even more artificial than the ordinary Spanish Ministry.What will be the outcome? It is, as always, very difficult for a foreigner to judge, but it seems certain that the fall of Romanones and the accession to power of Maura and Cierva at the scarcely disguised dictation of the army have made inevit-able within a comparatively short time the raising of the direct issue whether Spain is to be governed by Parliamentary and constitutional and more or less liberal prin-ciples, or whether it is to become once more a military absolutism. Romanones during the last six months or so had more and more definitely committed himself to a policy of radical reform, and if he would at the same time have firmly maintained order he might have guided Spain through&apos; the crisis which seems to lie before her. He boasts of having settled 300 strikes during his short term of office, but the fact that
there were 300 to settle scarcely seems to his credit, and many strong and genuine Liberals must have felt some sympathy with the veiled criticism which Alhucemas, himself neither strong nor genuine, made on the weak surrender to the Barcelona strikers. The military Juntas have everywhere shown an arrogance and violence which is incompatible with a constitutional and parliamentary system, but many constitutionally minded people will sympathise with their indignation at the feeble-ness which Romanones snowed in allowing the release of the mutinous soldiers to be made one of the conditions of the settlement of the strike^ It is certain that a liberal policy could not succeed unless it maintained order. A capitulation to the forces of anarchy was certain to lead ultimately to an undisguised, or, as at present, a disguised form of military government. So far Romanones, on his side, with the best political professions, perhaps intentions, failed to find the solution. It is much to be feared that Maura will fail even worse. For, though the most urgent of the immediate needs of Spain may be order, it seems certain that a surrender to military dictation will prove ultimately as dangerous, or almost as dangerous, as a surrender to Syndicalism. The mere maintenance of order has no issue, and unless after a time the King or Maura pluck up the courage to deal with the urgent problems of political, social and economic reform, which can probably only be handled after first subduing the bullies of the army, they must sooner or later, it would seem, find themselves face to face with a wave of popular agitation in which the whole system they represent, even the Monarchy itself, may only too probably be engulfed.The general condition of the country has considerably improved. The great strike in Barcelona ultimately produced a reaction. It is reported that there was considerable evidence of feeling against Syndicalism and against the terrorism it employed, and that this feeling was widespread, not only among the well-to-do classes, as: might be expected, but also among the workmen. The Citizen Militia, or Somaten, as they are called, were very active, undertook the distribution of letters and other public duties, and the Red Censorship, an attempt to control the press through the Syndicalists, utterly failed, and the whole situation was normal before Romanones left office. The strikers had been foolish enough to reopen the strike, or threaten to do so, after the extremely liberal settlement made by the Government, with the result that they were in the end completely defeated, and the whole agitation appears, so far as substantial results are concerned, to have collapsed ignominiously. So a strike of postmen in Madrid failed altogether, and finally an attempt of the telegraph workers to make a strike as a protest against the appointment of their enemy La Cierva to office was a complete&apos; failure, the men having to return to work on terms of unconditionaal submission. Whether these failures mean a return to saner and more orderly methods of conducting trade disputes it is too early to say. For the last few weeks at any rate labour conditions in Spain have been comparatively quiet, and if the masters can behave reasonably it is probable that the discredit of the Syndicalist leaders may keep the situation quiet for a time. There is some evidence of a movement among the more intelligent workmen of a definitely anti-Syndicalist character.Meanwhile many observers think the situation in agricultural Andalusia more serious than that of the great towns. Agricultural labourers and small farmers who have to go out as labourers have been forming themselves into very threatening unions, and many landowners have fled to the towns for refuge. The land system of Andalusia is as bad a one as it can possibly be; large tracts being held by absentee landowners and worked so badly that the crops produced are far below those obtained in other parts of Spain less fertile by nature. Fears are expressed that this move-ment may get worse during the harvest, and of course it is much more difficult to deal with sporadic outbursts of violence occurring in villages all over a large province than with anarchical disturbances in the crowded areas of a great city. The only thing to be said on the reassuring side is that nobody has ever heard of a revolution which began among peasants in a thinly populated rural district, Andalusia may be troublesome, but if the Monarchy is to be upset it must be done in Barcelona or Madrid.P S. The results of the elections are not yet fully known, but it appears from telegrams in to-day&apos;s papers s(June 4th) that, while the Maurists and Ciervists have gained some fifty or sixty seats from Liberals and Regionalists, the official Conserva-tives who follow Seilor Dato still number nearly 100. It is therefore plain that Maura and Cierva will not be able to govern constitutionally without securing a continuance of DatoJs support. . &apos;o
