On the other hand the Boards &quot;power to grant such certificate is not taken away and, &quot;if the Board is asked for such a certificate, I think &quot;that it is &quot;bound either to grant it or refuse it.   others  &quot;may quite well &quot;be numbers of cases in whioh the Board&apos;a &quot;Certificate will &quot;be helpful to the Court in deciding a &quot;question under the 1919 Act.&quot;Since the 1918 Act came into force, the Board have received numerous applications for certificates, hut there has only been one case in whioh it was necessary for the Bo to issue a certificate.II.
