IEGRETi^     &apos; S /s \L(This Docyraent is the Property ofHis Britannic Majes&apos;ty&apos;s Government.)POLICE   UNREST. (Circulated by the Home Secretary).ZCI desire if possible to make before the House adjourns for the Witsuntide Reooss, a statement on the Police question,iAs such a statement, if it is to have any value, must disclose thenpolicy we propose to pursue, I Bhould like to have the approval of the Cabinet of what I propose to say.Of oourse all matters dealing with pay and pensions are in abeyanoe until Lord Desborough^s Committee reports and I should therefore only propose to repeat with regard to these matters what I have already said.    The same applies to the Provident Association.    I am, however, very anxious to make a definite statement with regard to the Police Union,    I should like to   , explain to the House exactly what the arrangement was in AugusjAast and then detail to the House exactly how that arrangement has worked and how it has been treated by the leaders of the Union,    I want to say that that arrangement oannot bo allowed to oontinue,    I and those who advise me have been working out a soheme of organisation for the Police managed by them-selves within their own body, which will ensure that the interests of the youngest constable will be completely safeguarded, and any grievance, he may have can be taken to the highest authority.    1 understand Lord Desborough&apos;s Committee has boen considering the same question, and I should consult with Lord Tesborough as to how far it was possible in any statement I made to mention any details,    I want to be able to tell the House that we propose to place such an organisation upon a statutory basis.    It will, of oourse, be entirely confined in every way to serving police offioers, will oover the whtle oountry, and will be free from any description of outside interference,The policy I suggest which I should like to outline to the House is that when that organisation has been created wo should then call upon every serving police officer to leave the Polioe and Prison Servants1 Union,    Suoh a declaration must be made sooner or later, and I am advised that the present ic by far the best time to make it,    I should of oourso make it quite clear that when the Polis-e were asked to withdraw from a body which they had been permitted to join there was at least an equally effioiont organisation for their mutual protection,I should be glad if I oould have an immediate decision,E, S.4th June, 1919
