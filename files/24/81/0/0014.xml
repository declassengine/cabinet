I ms U( HIjttmannic sv3a.je3ty&apos;s 0 MEMORANDUM BY MI^I^TM&apos;&apos;^&quot;iroOtJr&apos;.T-ffWAR CABINET IN REGARD Ttt EMPLOYEFOR DISABLED EX-SERVICE MEN.i!ALk5^^$t Is necessary again to call the attention of the v/ar Cabinet to the position of disabled ex-service men, which was dealt with in a joint memorandum of the 15th.December, by the Ministers cf Labour and Pensions (Memorandum No; G*T* 64^3).   The recommendations made In that memorandum were not adopted; but an Appeal, signed by the Prime Minister, was Issued on the 8th,March to employers generally throughout the country, inviting them to employ disabled ex-service men in as large a proportion as possible.   This appeal has not had the anticipated effect, and it becomes necessary to contemplate other measures.The present position is ae followsThe number of disabled ex-service men on the Registers of the Employment Exchanges in Great Erltlan, for whom employment cannot be found was on 9th. May, 1919, 37,983,   Within the next few months 40,000 men in receipt of disablement pensions are expected to fee discharged from military hospitals, and a further number will continue to reach the Exchange from L&amp;charge Centres and Munition Works,   There seems at present no prospect of the labour market   absorbing any considerably proportion of   these men.I view the position with great anxiety.    The numbers concerned are relatively small if compared with the whole number of the unemployed.     It is not, however, necessary to emphasise the effect, which will be produced on discharged service men as a whole if no adequate provision is made for the employment of the disabled,A certain number (though necessarily small) can return to, and are iro fact, cither under statutory obligations or as/result of voluntary ipledre-B being reinstated in their old occupations. A further quota can be and are being fleaIt with by the Training facilities offered by the Training Department of the Ministry of Labour,    But it cannot be hoped that even the majority of the men now unemployed can be absorbed in this way^-sIt Is necessary. *o formulate a policy immediately if we are to avoid compulsion on the employers or the creation of national factories for the employment of these men - a proposal which the Government has already rev jested as Impracticable * -In framing proposals it is, however* essential that nothing should be done to bring the disabled men into conflict with the Trade Unions,The agreements my Department have concluded with Trade Associations In most of the staple trades relate to the admission o disabled men into the ranks of skilled workers only after a long period of training.    These schemes will only cover a small part of the unemployed^ disabled men and I cannot risk jeopardizing the existing agreements by asking for the admission of further unskilled men without such a period of training.     ^y present proposals do not interfere with the agreements already made as to the training of disabled men in certain of the staple trades, either, in factories or institutions or both,The proposals set out below therefore proceed throughout on the assumption that disabled men shall not, unless qualified, be employed on work ordinarily performed by skilled men,/The
The War Cabinet may be aware that for some timo past two scher.es designed to secure the absorption of disabled men have been before the public, known respectively as the Roth-band and Rotherham Schemes.   The Scheme I outline adopts a portion of both these schemes, but involves in addition certain new ftvaturesSv-^ features.I propose in the first place to initiate immediately a national scheme under which employers will be asked to give an undertaking to find work for as many disabled men as possible, but in no case less than b% of their total staff. Tliis percentage can be varied either by an application centrally by a trade to the Ministry of Labour or locally by application of an individual employer to the Local Employment Committee.     I should be prepared to negotiate on this point with any trade which desires negotiation, and In any case propose to explain the scheme in detail to trade organisations, both at meetings and by circular.    Employers who sign the under-taking will be given a certificate to that effect by the Ministry of Labour, and will be authorised to stamp their stationery with an official ,die*.The employers who or* authorised to use the die will have their names inscribed In a Central Register, which will be known as the Roll of Honour.     If the scheme be adopted I am anxious that the C-government should give a load to employers,   I propose that this should be dene in throo ways:--(1) by the Government undertaking to employ not less than b% of disabled men in the various Government Departments,(2) by.the ^Government undertaking, to employ not less than 5% of disabled men in Government industrial establishments$(5) by deciding that no contractor shall be eligible to tender for a Government contract, unless he has signed an undertaking and is in possession of the certificate^I should propose, as the procedure to give effect to the third proposal, to ask for a Resolution of thDbHousc of Commons on the analogy of the Fair Mgos Resolution, and would ask leave to introduce this Resolution t^mediaiely after the 1/whitsun Recess.     Further the English and Scottish Local Government Boards- should be asked to urge Local Authorities tonfoliow the lead of the State in this matter.The question of the wages to be paid to a disabled man is a difficult one on-the whole I should not propose to disturb the existing arrangement which, is that a man should bo paid tho rate for the job unless the employer can show that his earning capacity has been definitely impaired.    In that case, if a ga$rratc cannot be agreed the matter may be referred to a Local Employment Committee.     The Committee will either refer the matter for advice to a competent local organisation of the trade, dr where one does not exist, will refer it to a Technical Sub-Committoe o  its own.     This procedure Is based on a recommendation made to the Board of trade in 1916 by a Sub-employed Coranitteo of Statutory Pensions Committee in which employers lzi&amp;/ wore represented.   *I am fully alive to the * fact that the position has been profoundly modified by the large increase in the numbers of disabled men, but the objections to^:apy othor course 3eem to me very difficult to surmount.   This proposal would apply generally to Government and private Contractors.I also think that the rhole question of the employment of temporary female staff In Government Departments should be considered with a view to replacing it as far as possiMe by aisablod officers or men, according tc the grade of work.Ahe
The Heads of Government Departments should bo invited to effort this change as rapidly and as oampletcly as the interests of thfl work will permit.f/hile these proposals arc made for dealing with disabled hen I think that it would be a phychologlval mistake.to omit reference to demobilised men as a whole,     I propose therefore to issue an instruction to Employment Exchanges that in offering a nan for a vacancy, other things being equal, preference shall be given to ex-Dervicc men over civilians.It appears to me that it is essential to announce these proposals at once,     1 cr.i further of opinion that, it should be made clear that, in the event of failure, the Government will have to contemplate some compulsory measure-,I therefore ask for the authority of the War Cfbinot,(a) to launch the schome providing for a fixed percentage, an official die, and the roll of honour *(b) to take stops to secure a Resolution of the House of Commons to deal with toe employment of disabled men by Government contractor3*(c) to announce that the Government will, give a lead by undertaking to employ 0$ of disabled Ren both in tho Government Service and in Government IndustrialEs tabli shmcnts*(d) to arrange with the Treasury for a circular t* be issued to al 1 Government..Departments with regard to the employment in substitution for women holding temporary posts of men who have served in the Forces.-and   (e) to issue an instruction to Employment Exchanges that ex-service men are to have a preference other things being equal over civilian labour in being offered for vacancies,R.S.
