(THIS DpCUMJ IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRIT AMI c MAJESTY! ^OVlMSffXw56secret.war cabinet:,j 0*.Gr T   749^- &apos;  r u REI1TSTATBMSKT OF CIVIL SERVICE OOISClg^TIQUSobjucItors&quot;;(Memorandum from the Treasury).As a result of the decision of the Government to release the Conscientious Objectors who have been employed under the Home Office Committee numerous applications have reached the Treasury from Departments asking whether they should reinstate Civil Service Conscientious Objectors.Excluding the men allowed to join in the non-combatant corps (who have &quot;been in receipt of army pay and have &quot;been treated in precisely thfc same manner as Civil Servants in the combatant Forces) there are five different classes, which have been dealt with hitherto in the following manner:-1.   The Civil Servants who were granted absolute exemption by their tribunals,2.   Those who were granted conditional exemption by their tribunals but were allowed to continue working in their Departments.Both the above classes have hitherto been treated on the lines laid down by the Treasury in February 1917 anfl con-firmed by the War Cabinet decisions of 14th December 1917 (W.C.298.Minute 18) and 22nd February, 1918 (W.C35?- Minute 12) iVe, they have been receiving either their former race of pay without any increase, cr the rate of pay for a temporary employee doing the same work, whichever was the less, and their period of service in this capacity has been regarded as special leave which will not count for increment Or pension in their permanent posts.3*   Those who were granted exemption by their tribunal on oondition that they took up work of national importance else-where than in their Department.   These men have been granted special leave of absence without pay.4. Those who, having failed to obtain exemption from -their tribunal and having been called up for service with the forces, were subsequent1&quot; imprisoned for offences committed on the ground of conscientious objection to military service but who were subsequently transferred to take up work of national importance under the Home Office Committee.5.   Men who belong to the same class as 4, but who either refused or were not allowed to take up work under the Home Office Committee and continue to serve their sentences.The men in both the above classes were dismissed from the Service, but the question of reinstatement after the war was left open.( There is a difference in the legal position of these classes in that the first three have ntot been guilty of any offence against the law but exercised the right given to them by Parliament to claim exemption from military service, whereee? the last two classes have definitely broken the law.   At the same time the precise position in which these men find thera-selves is no doubt largely dependent on the caprice of the
tribunal before which they appeared, and the Wurth class may be- -regarded as having been recognised by the Government as aleo genuinely entitled te exemption under the Military Service Acts. I understand that both the War Office and the Home Office are inclined to take the view that the men who actually suffered imprisonment include a larger proportion of genuine though mis-guided Conscientious Objectors than the other olasses.   It is therefore difficult to draw any distinction between them and I think that the first four classes at least, must all &quot;be dealt with on the same lines.Many of these men appear to have been capable arid efficient Civil Servants and in several cases Departments have expressed their desire to reinstate them.   Apart from this, it is difficult to justify a permanent refusal to reinstate the men who were granted exemption by their tribunal, and who committed no offence against the law.On the other hand a definite announcement by the Treasury that Conscientious Objectoie Bhould be reinstated would, I feel, be received with considerable resentment by the discharged soldier and by the public geneially,   Respite the provisions of the Military Service Acts the discharged soldiers would certainly argue that any posts which are vacant should be filled by the employment of men who have fought for their country rather than by those who refused the obligations of eitzenship^I feel, therefore, that the time is not ripe for taking any definite decision to reinstate these men and that this should wait until a general amnesty has been proclaimed.In the meantime I would propose to notify Departments (1) that, in view of the release of the men employed under the Home Office Committee, it is open to them if they so desire to re-employ Civil Servant Conscientious Objectors in the first four classes, provided their record is satisfactory, but that the remuneration and status of any men so re-employed should continue to be regulated on the temporary basis approved by the War Cabinet in 1917;   and (2) that any Civil Servants who fall under Class 5 above (i.e, those who wore not allowed or refused release to take up work under the Home Office Committees) should not be re-employed.As the treatment of Conscientious Objectors was one of the questions raised by the &quot;Triple Alliance&quot;, I should be glad to have a decision of the Cabinet on these proposals before carrying them into effect.Treasury, S.W.1.
