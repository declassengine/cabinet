Following from lioos-Keppel dated 11th June :  (J) &quot;All quiet districts and agencies north of Kabul River. Khyber Agency all quiet on Khyber and Mulhigori roads, and in (corrupt group). Villagers are successfully guarding telephone line and arrangements are again being mude to use Mullagori road for pack transport, convoys being guarded by tribesmen. Afridis held tribal jirga on Friday at Bagh and discussed raiding in Peshawar district by Afridi deserters and Peshawari outlaws. This raiding is being actively stimulated by Afghan agents who appear to be well supplied with money. Afridi elders say that these agents have been sent by Amir to embroil tribe with Government. If peace is not made with Afghanistan, Afridis may bo driven to join Afghans while if peace is made Government will still be forced to punish Afridis which Afghans desire on account of their disappointment that Afridis have not yet risen as hoped. Maliks and elders wrote a letter to the Political: Agent assuring him of Afridis&apos; determination to remain loyal, but when the letter was despatched it was forcibly intercepted by a large number of well-armed deserters under command of Afghan agents. Elders have sent in messages to the Political Agent that they&apos;will continue to endeavour to restrain their tribesmen as far as possible and point out that both in Peshawar District and in Afghanistan many offences are attributed to Afridis which are really committed, by local people. Orakzais quiet. Cholera is spreading among them. arabia Khel have severe epidemic. Kurrani reports 9th June, 18 hours, Nadir Khan reported to be at Zambar north of Matun waiting for orders from.

Kohat Jovvaki jirgas came in lor allowances, which were paid as they have not committed themselves. This is unusual in Ramazan and shows desire to keep in touch with authorities though Jowakis may be influenced by belief current in Kohat district, of Afghans&apos; intention to attack again at the Id.

Some influential Hindus from Peshawar visited Pandi Kotal yesterday to discuss with Zakka Khel Maliks and elders recent kidnapping of some Hindus from Peshawar district. Zakka Khel heatedly pointed out to them that they were mainly responsible for the disturbances in India, and Peshawar which had contributed to the war and that if they now suffer they have no one but themselves to blame, also that Musulmians would as usual suffer in the end for the intrigues of Hindus. Recrudescence of raiding into Peshawar district and carrying off Hindus after so many years of quiet has completely broken up the idea of unity of the two races, and the leaders of the unity movement are universally blamed. Mohmands all quiet. Mahasal, the Mohmand raider, with a gang of about 100 Afghan Mohmands went to Hazarnao on 9th instant intending to attack our foraging parties. Villagers of llazarnao refused to allow him to stay there so he moved to the hills. Another gang of about 50 Sangu Khel Shinwaris is out in the same neighbourhood. Chaknawar Mullah is endeavouring to raise a lashkar to attack our camp at Dakka but has so far failed.

In Peshawar City more copies in English and vernacular of the manifesto of Provisional Government of
India have been found. Also a new lealJot emanating from the Frontier Young Men&apos;s Association which is dated from Kabul containing exhortations to help the Amir to free India, and is signed by one of the schoolboys and by a veterinary assistant of Koliat who went with him to Kabul in II] 10.&quot;(3) &quot;Knrram reports receipt of polite message from Sarsaros commanding Afghan troops on Peiwar Kotal. Sarsaros writes that he launched his attack of 5th instant in ignorance of orders which he received on 0th. In accordance with orders he withdrew to ridge, but cannot withdraw to Ali Khel without further instructions for which he has asked.&quot;Following from Baluchistan, dated 11th June: &quot;Bruce readied Musa Khel evening of l()th June with small escort. Telegraph line between Murgha and Musa Khel cut shortly afterwards. Aeroplane reconnaissance morning of 1.1th June reported attack by small bodies was proceeding on Musa Khel, posts and water (? cut off). Infantry reinforcements have reached halfway, and will arrive to-day or to-morrow. Attackers may possibly be Sherannis only. If Musa Khel tribe have definitely risen, disorder may be expected shortly among neighbouring Punjab tribes.&quot;Following from Consul, Seistan. dated 11th June: &quot;Report states Farah, Bakwagirishk and Lower Helmand Valley have now been constituted single military district under Chakansur, and that steps are being taken to despatch towards Seistan frontier all regulars and irregulars who can be collected in these areas. It is rumoured I hat additional troops may also be expected from Kandahar and Herat. With adoption of a definite policy political situation now enters a new phase. Hitherto talk has been faster than precautions against possible aggression by ourselves. This was attributable to arrival of two companies of regulars in Seistan over estimate of our localstrength, to natural inclination to maintain peaceful relations with Persia, and 1o confusion caused by contradictory orders as to movements of troops. Present tendencies in Chakansur now tending daily io become more aggressive, fanatical and bombastic, and while better opinion there appears in favour of avoiding offence tu Persians, and awaiting arrival of reinforcements, there are also strong supporters of policy of immediate aggression in form oil large raiding gangs, and of hampering our arrangements for collection and transport of supplies for main line of communication.&quot;
