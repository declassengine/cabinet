[This Document is the Property of liis Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.   June 1919.CONFIDENTIAL7435MAINTENANCE ORDERS.mm?I CIRCULATE to the War Cabinet copies of a draft Bill to facilitate the enforcement in the United Kingdom of maintenance orders made in other parts of His MajestyJs Dominions and vice versa. The origin of this Bill is a resolution passed by the Imperial Conference in 1911 in favour of the adoption in the constituent parts of the Empire of reciprocal legal provisions in the interests of deserted wives and children.It will be observed that the draft Bill provides for the enforcement in the United Kingdom of maintenance orders made by the Courts of those parts of Plis Majesty&apos;s Dominions outside the United Kingdom which may enact reciprocal provisions; for the enforcement in the United Kingdom, after confirmation by the Courts of the United Kingdom, of provisional orders made by the Courts of such parts of His Majesty&apos;s Dominions, against persons resident in the United Kingdom; and for the making by the Courts of the United Kingdom of provisional orders against persons resident in such parts of His Majesty&apos;s Dominions with a view to their enforcement in such parts of His Majesty&apos;s Dominions after confirma-tion by the Courts thereof. The delay in dealing with this matter is due to correspondence with the Governments of the Self-governing Dominions&apos; regarding the terms of the Bill, and the enactment of reciprocal legislation in the Dominions.All the Dominions in the case of Australia, the six States have accepted the principle of the Bill and have undertaken to pass reciprocal legislation, with the exception of Canada, in which case the views of the Provincial Governments are still awaited.In view of the long delay which has occurred, it is thought desirable to proceed as soon as possible with this measure, and I trust that sanction will be given for the introduction of the Bill in Parliament during the present Session.MILNER.Downing Street, June 4, 1919.[2047]

jurisdiction sitting and acting for the same place shall, after A.D. 1919, giving the prescribed notice, proceed to take the evidence in     &quot; like manner and subject to the like conditions as the evidence in support of the original application.5 If upon the hearing of such evidence it appears to the court that the order ought not to have been made, the court may rescind the order, but in any other case the depositions shall be sent to the Secretary of State and dealt with in like manner as the original depositions.10 (5) The confirmation of an order made under this section shall not affect any power of a court of summary jurisdiction to vary or rescind that order.
