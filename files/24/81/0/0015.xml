On 21st March the policy was approved that the two British battalions now in Siberia should be withdrawn ; and that steps should be taken to continue our support of Admiral Kolchak by enlarging on a voluntary basis the present mission in Siberia, so as to provide a moral stiffening to his forces. The Canadian brigade was already awaiting repatriation to Canada.General Knox was informed of this decision on the 29th March, and he was asked to state how the increase of the Mission, which was not to exceed 2,000 all ranks (exclusive of General Jack&apos;s railway staff and certain medical personnel needed by the Mission), should be affected. Two suggestions were made to him : the first, that the Canadian brigade should be reconstituted as a Russian formation, with Eussian personnel and a proportion of British officers and other ranks ; and the second, that parties of British officers and men should be attached to fighting units for the purpose of instruction, encouragement and example.2. General Knox replied (wire received 14th April) that the only way in which he could use non-Russian speaking officers and men was as an example in actual fighting at the front and for demonstration to troops in rear; and that a number of machine-gun units to be attached to Eussian troops at the front would be the best method of using the personnel of the Mission. He amplified this statement (wire received 29th April) by informing the War Office that he had spoken to Kolchak on the subject of forming a brigade of Eussian troops led by British officers and non-commissioned officers, with an artillery detachment included, and that Kolchak was inj j *favour of the scheme.He proposed to use the l/9th Bn. Hampshire Eegiment as a nucleus for this brigade and to move it to Ekaterinburg without delay. Those of this regiment that did not volunteer would be sent bacK on the arrival of volunteers. He repeated the suggestion that the bulk of the enlarged Mission should come in the form of machine-gun units.3. General Knox&apos;s proposal for the formation of the Anglo-Russian brigade was approved on 14th May by the Secretary of State for War, as a departmental matter, in pursuance of the policy approved in March. The considerations which guided the Secretary of State were that while the proposals of General Knox differed considerably from the suggestions that had been put before him by the War Office, they were not essentially opposed to them; and that as he had already, by speaking of them to Admiral Kolchak, more or less committed the Government to their support, it would have been impossible to withdraw from them without affecting our relations with the Admiral and without causing uncertainty and confusion, which would inevitably have had a prejudicial effect on the military situation. - General Knox was therefore notified that his proposals were approved, but at the same time was informed that he should not have committed himself to this scheme, which was materially different to either of the two alternatives originally suggested to him, without having received prior sanction. A special condition was made that none of the l/9th Bn. Hampshire Eegiment should be employed unless they volunteered.4. On the 14th May the Chancellor of the Exchequer drew tho attention of the War Cabinet to a telegram from Mr. Hodgson at Omsk, in which the latter referred to to the proposed Anglo-Russian brigade, and pointed out that this step committed the British Government to a more definite support of Admiral Kolchak&apos;s Government than they had hitherto afforded. Lord ^Curzon agreed that it was closely related to the question of recognition of Kolchak, and the War Cabinet decided to refer the proposal to the Foreign Office and War Office and to the British representatives in Paris, and that pending receipt of the latter&apos;s views sanction should not be given.5. When it became known at the. War Office that the formation of this Anglo-Eussian brigade had been discussed as a matter of policy at a War Cabinet meeting, a letter was sent to the Foreign Office (dated 19th May) informing them of the measures that had then been taken and of the considerations that had led to their adoption.(B19/269)   70 6/19  H&amp;s  7198wo
6. The Secretary of State for War gave his opinion that the details of how the increased personnel of the Mission should be employed was purely a departmental &apos; matter concerning the War Office only, and therefore did not need to be referred to the * t War Cabinet, and directed that action to carry out the proposals put forward by General Knox should continue. In this Mr. Balfour concurred. On 23rd May a further telegram from General Knox making proposals relative to the numbers of officers and non-commissioned officers required and to their emoluments was received. The proposals were approved by the Secretary of State for War, who directed that all necessary steps should be taken to give effect to them.7. In view of the fact that the War Cabinet had given their attention to the question of the formation of the Anglo-Russian brigade, and had referred it to the Departments concerned for their opinions, and to the British Military Representatives in Paris, instructions were given by the Secretary of State for War to submit the matter for discussion by the War Cabinet.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.UhJune, 1919.
APPENDIX.The scheme formulated by General Knox for the formation of a brigade of Russian troops under British leadership is as follows : A. Organization The Brigade is eventually to consist of two regiments, each of four battalions, to which will be attached a division of two 4-gun batteries.Total force    ...     ..      ..   8 battalions.2 batteries (8 guns).B. Command The command of the Brigade will be vested in a Brigadier-General, with a Colonel as his second in command. Bach battalion will be commanded by a Major and each company by a Captain with another officer as second in command. There will presumably be a Lieutenant-Colonel to command each of the two regiments, but this is not specified in the scheme.Tne platoon commanders and platoon Serjeants are to be British non-commissioned officers, and there will further be two regimental serjeant-majors, with eight battalion serjeant-majors and eight battalion quartermaster-serjeants.The total British personnel for the infantry amounts to 1 brigadier-general. 75 officers.274 non-commissioned officers.The details for the artillery are not stated, and in the last wire General Knox states that this is to be entirely of Russian personnel.Allowing for additions that may have to be made to the numbers stated above, the British personnel with the Brigade is estimated by General Knox at-90 officers. 300 non-commissioned officers.&apos; C. Pay and allowances General Knox proposes that ^1.) All British personnel shall receive the pay of their acting rank, and shall receive thesame pay and allowances as the personnel of the Mission. (2.) That Government rations shall be issued when possible, and that allowances shall begiven if rations cannot be issued. (3.) That non-commissioned officers with the Brigade shall be given the same bonus thatwas given to non-commissioned officers employed in training Indian troops in indian 1918..D. Comparative cost Even if the Mission is filled up to its full established strength of 2,000 aDd the extra pay and allowances asked for in (U) above are granted, it is obvious that the total cost of theiVIission is much lower than the cost of the British and Canadian troops now in Siberia.
