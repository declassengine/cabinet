SEC HE T.G.T.,7445.W A RCABINED1.THE EDUCATION fCOMPLIANCE V/ITHMemorandum by tho President of the Board of Education.Tho draft Bill which is circulated with this Memorandum is designed to meet tho difficulty which presents itself in the case of schools and other educational institutions conducted under Trusts or Instruments which are inconsistent with the conditions for tho rocoipt of grant imposed by the Regulations of the Board of Education,      Tho application of such an institution for grants cannot be ontertained unless tho Trust Deod or Instrument of Government is altered by a Scheme made under the Charitable Trusts Acts, or the Endowed Schools Acts, or by a competent Court.       Such alteration ofton occasions great delay and inconvenience.Tho Elementary Eduoation Act of 1870 contains a provision enabling the managers of elementary schools to fulfil tho con-ditions of a parliamentary grant notwithstanding any provision contained in any instrument regulating the trusts or management of their schools.     Tho present Bill placos tho Governing Bodies of Secondary Schools and other institutions of higher education in the same position as Managers of Public Elementary Schools; and in view of tho recent modification of the Regulations for Secondary Schools in receipt of grants I have reason to believe that the Bill will be weleomo to the Governing Bodies, who will now wish to apply for Grants,(Initialled).
