There is already a very serious shortage of personnel, especially in the skilled trades. In the case of motor drivers the shortage amounts to not less than 2,500, and drivers cannot be enlisted. It is impossible to deal with the repair and operation of Rolls-Royce engines, owing to the complete lack of properly trained personnel.The increasing deterioration caused by the present uncertainty and the loss of the best men is shown by the formidable list of fatal accidents since the armistice, nearly all of which would be preventable under good conditions. Ten times as many officers and men in the Royal Air Force have been hilled since the armistice in ordinary flying as in all our operations in Russia out of much smaller numbers who actually fly.The above particulars indicate that the present situation is very grave and that the whole framework of the Royal Air Force is in danger of collapse immediately after the declaration of peace unless drastic action is taken at once.The essential preliminary to such action is to settle the terms for permanent service, and to publish them quickly as a basis for recruiting.The situation as regards officers is as serious as the situation as regards other ranks.Officers have now been waiting for months for information as to what the terms of permanent service will he, and the feeling in the Force as to the delay which has occurred, and the complete uncertainty of the future, is so strong that it is doubtful whether, in the absence of immediate action, it will be possible to fill up the estab-lishment of 1,500 permanent officers and 2,500 temporary officers recently approved by the War Cabinet.There are, for instance, not now sufficient applicants above the rank of Major to fill the establishment. On the 11th November there were 283 substantive Lieutenant-Colonels on the Air Force list. The proper course would have been to fill the new permanent List of Lieutenant-Colonels with a portion of these and to revert the remainder to the rank of Major. As matters stand, there will still be vacancies after all recommended applicants have been selected. There will be, of course, a certain number of Flying Officers and Captains, surplus to those holding permanent commissions who will take temporary commissions, but a large number of the officers whom it was desired to keep, and who had gained decorations at the Front, are applying day after day for work outside. If the terms of permanent service are issued quickly, it may be possible to retain some of these and to get back others, but it is to be feared that the delay which has already occurred will involve, in too many cases, the retention of officers who are not the best officers.To meet the above situation it is imperatively necessary that the Cabinet should settle at once permanent pay andv pension terms, Unless this is done, I apprehend something approaching a collapse of the air defence of the country on the declaration of peace.I accordingly submit for.approval the proposals for pay of officers and other ranks and pension of officers shown in the schedules to this memorandum. These proposals have been framed independently of the Jerram proposals for the Navy, and are put forward on their own merits. Attention is, however, directed to the rates proposed by the Jerram Committee for the officers of the Royal Marines.(B19/282)  100  6/19  fl&amp;s  7226wo
The rates of pay proposed for officers below the rank of Colonel, though in some cases higher than the pre-war rates, are always lower than the war rates, including bonus, whereas the Jerram Committee scale is considerably in advance of the present Navy rates, including bonus. In any comparison with the emoluments of the Navy and Army, it has to be remembered thet the risk of flying is shown by statistics to be even greater now than it has been in the past, the reason being that much more is demanded of the pilot. He has to control a swifter machine and perform more difficult feats, such as flying low between obstacles, landing in a small space and night flying.The fact that a large proportion of the officers will be held on short temporary engagements makes it imperatively necessary that the nucleus of permanent officers should be men of exceptional aptitude for practical flying, and of exceptional attainment in flying and mechanics. The emoluments should be on a sufficient scale to attract men of this calibre. It is in fact a question whether the&apos;emoluments generally are not on too low a scale, being less than the present rates with bonus. 4s, however, the pension terms are more generous than at present, I trust the terms will be sufficient to attract the best i  glass of officer now likely to be available.The rates are high in relation to the Jerram Committee rates for junior ranks only, because it is the Lieutenant and the Captain who will do continuous flying, while for the higher ranks, who will fly much less, the rates correspond very closely with those proposed for the Navy.The Army proposals for the pay of officers are not yet decided, but they will not in any event be dependent or reacted upon by these flying rates of pay. The army level will be affected not by the flying rates but by the rates fixed by the Cabinet for the Royal Marines and generally in regard to the Jerram report. These Jerram rates will dominate the Army rates, there is therefore no reason why an immediate and independent decision should not be taken on the flying rates.In the scales for other ranks, the chief point of divergence from the Jerram Committee&apos;s proposals is the annual increment for the Serjeant-Major Class 1. He will be a highly trained technical non-commissioned officer, and the intention is that when qualified serjeant-majors exist in sufficient numbers, they will be employed in many appointments now filled by commissioned officers, and a substantial economy will thus be effectedI draw special attention to the fact that the scales have been drawn on the basis that officers&apos; messes and officers&apos; quarters will be furnished, and the furniture maintained, at the public expense, and that officers will be provided with rations. It appears to me that these concessions are reasonable and are not more than is necessary to meet existing conditions.&apos; If lodging and other allowances are increased to about the scale recommended by the Jerram Committee and the present beneficial rates for income tax are continued, the figure of 1,850,000/. per annum which represents the pay of 3,700 officers would be increased to about 2,775,000/. per annum (to represent the total effective cost) and a corresponding increase would result in the other figures for officers given in the table. As regards other ranks, any increase of allowances, apart from separation allowance, would not have an important effect, as other ranks are as a rule provided for in kind.12lh June, 1919.WINSTON S.
