IIS DQCTOKT 13 TO PROPERTY OF HIS BRIT AMI C MAJESTYjS GOVERNMENT.)IJFC RE T..T.7408.WAR CABI1ST.OFFICE ACCOMMODATION AND DEMOBILISATION.Note &quot;by the Acting Secretary..The enclosed letter from the Director of Quartering to the President of the Board of Trade, together with a list of premises occupied in the London area by the Dominion and American forces, is circulated for information,(Sd) Thomas Jones Acting Secretary.2,t Yfriitehall Gardens, S.W. &apos; 4th, June, 1919.
.M.2212.U.M.G.1.)EN CLOSURE.29th May, 1919.Sir,With reference to paragraph 3 (a) of the proceedings of the conference held at the Board of Trade on the 20th May, 1919, I forward herewith a list of premises occupied in the London Area by the Dominion and American Forces,This list shows in all cases except that of the South African Forces the approximate dates of release of the premises.   In the case of the South African Forces the occupation may be regarded as semi-permanent, as it is essential that they should retain for some time to come military offices in London to deal with the many questions that arise as an outcome of the war.   The quantity of space occupied is however negligible.I consider the situation as disclosed by the list is satisfactory.   In the majority of cases premises occupied will be released by the Autumn, and in those isolated cases where surrender is delayed until 1920, I am satisfied that to disturb the establishments now occupying the premises would only delay the demobilization of the Forces concerned, and ultimately defeat the object we all have in view, namely, the speedy and orderly re-establishment of peace conditions.In some cases, notably the Belgrave Mansions Hotel and Revesby Street Garage, the dates have been substantially advanced under arrangements made with the Dominion Authorities concerned, and other cases are also in hand, notably those premises occupied by the Australian Imperial Forces; but in connection with the latter it is pointed out that the repatriation of the Australian Forces has been delayed owing to shipping difficulties.Yours etc.(Sd) H.L.AlexanderMaj or-GeneralThe Private Secretary to Director of QuarteringSir Auckland Geddes,President, Board of Trade.
