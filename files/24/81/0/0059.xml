Thism His d(P 3108)        From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign, Department,Vilh June 1919.Priority A.   Clear the line.Foreign Secret. Your telegram, No. 837, 9th June. Afghanistan. I have no wish to discuss an incident and action which are past and must now be accepted, but you have misunderstood my telegram. His Majesty&apos;s Government have no sort of wish to prolong war with Afghanistan, or to impose unnecessarily stern terms, and the advantages of a speedy peace are quite obvious. The dangers of prolongation of warfare are equally plain. The only suggestion of a possible advance to Kabul came from your Government. My criticism was based on an apprehension, as I stated, that in seeking that peace which we all desired you had used language which, in our opinion, insufficiently conveyed the fact that your attitude was the attitude of the victor.do is ment js,.11110 SVl Cl.J-0;)erty *emnrM
