Secret.   Afghanistan.   Following from Roos-Keppel, dated 6th June: &quot; Tochi wires (corrupt group) 5th instant, 18 hours, Waziris and Mahsiids again sending (corrupt group) to (corrupt group) Shah (? Bazurg) to ask for help (corrupt group) all lashkar will probably disperse. Most lashkar already broken up, and many of Afghan lashkar have deserted Nadir Khan. Total Mahsud and VVazir lashkar in Upper Tochi probably do not exceed 1,200. Kohat reports cholera in Kohat city and cantonments, also at Hangu and Thai. Donald reports from Hangu that gathering of Orakzai to meet Mullah Mahmud does not appear hostile as tribal jirgas proceeded to rendezvous without standards, drums, or fifes. Donald considers that jirgas assembled out of respect for Mullah Mahmud Akhundzada will disperse on learning of Nadir Khan&apos;s retirement. Eight Orakzai were killed and wounded at Haclmeala on 1st June. Small parties of Zakka Khels out on Kohat border for looting. Political, Thai, telegraphs 5th June, 14 Lours, five large towers of Biland Khal blown up, some sniping, no news of Nadir Khan&apos;s army. Khyber reports further information confirming news that Afridis are watching results of peace negotiations and are unlikely to move. Another jirga is being held at Bagh to-day, and vernacular copies of leaflet announcing that Amir has formally sued for peace have been sent to Tirah in time for jirga. Assistant Political Agent, Chitral, telegraphs from Mirkani on 5th June, 12 hours : &apos; Report received to-day that all quiet in Dhyand Dir tribesmen who may have gone towards Asmar probably only scallywags attracted by prospect of looting Bashgalis. The live Asmar regiments have remained stationary. Movable column arrives in Drosh to-day, scouts and bodyguards remain at selected positions. A^ery friendly letters passing between Nawab of Dir and Mohtar of Chitral and Assistant Political Agent, Chitral.&apos; All tribes north of Kabul river quiet, also all districts except Dera Ismail Khan.&quot;Following from Baluchistan, dated 6th JuneForce of Sherannis, &amp;c, with some Waziris and renegade militia in hills round Kapip, roughly estimated at about 3,000, though reports naturally much exaggerate numbers. Officer Commanding Zhob Militia telegraphs, afternoon of 6th June, from Lakaband, he has received a letter from Jacob, dated 5th June, stating that Sulaiinan Khel lashkar is marching on Fort Sandeman. Numbers of lashkar and Jacob&apos;s source of information not stated. If Jacob&apos;s report is true it is possible that, as the Sulaiman Khel have ample (corrupt group), that this new force (of) is formidable. In anticipation of authority asked for I communicated (corrupt group) Musa Khel&apos;s statement concerning Muafis to those helping us.&quot;We have authorised Agent to the Governor-General to promise Muafis to secure loyalty and co-operation of tribes and individuals in case of serious emergency, but have deprecated any general proclamation on subject as likely to give idea of panic.Following from Meshed, dated&quot;6th June Herat all quiet up to 1st June. On 28th May (six corrupt groups) left for (? Kafirkila), and 150 infantry and 2 batteries of 6 guns each were detailed to be in readiness to start at a moment&apos;s notice for same locality. Note of congratulation on succession sent to new Amir by public of Herat received gracious reply; same communication sent by garrison received none, much to their disgust. Mohained Sarwar Khan, former Governor of Herat, left Kabul 16th May to take up Governorship, and firman appointing him reached Herat 28th May; with this arrived from Amir general exhortation to holy war against British, reference being made to previous Afghan wars and obvious, desire of British to absorb Afghanistan now. This has caused much talk in the city, but arrival of Abdul Kudus Khan is awaited. On the 3.0th May letter addressed to Governor-General of Khorassan was prepared in which be was told to eject British troops from Khorassan-otherwise Afghans would invade province. No news here yet of the arrival of this document.&quot;
