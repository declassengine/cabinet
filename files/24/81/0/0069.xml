ministry OP SHIPPING.imorandum by the Shipping Controller,The Shipping Controller thinks the time has come when a statement should be made by him to the War Cabinet as to the past, present and future, st. At a Conference of Ministers held at the Ministry ofShipping on the 19th December   last tin proposals of the Ministry contained inrG.T-.6472 and G.T, 6544 were approved and it was then decided to arrange for the substitution of direction and license in controlling shipping in place of control by requisition, with the avowed object of trying to-. recover &quot;some of the enormous trade which during the war has been lost to Great Britain&quot; .(G.T in other words to restore shipping to the Cross trades and the more distant routes while there   was yet time.and before our competitors had established themselves too firmly,Arrangements were inaugurated accordingly in January 1919 and the policy has been followed until the large majority of feent      British vessels are&apos;now off requisition and are running subject to license and direction as to cargoes carried. The Government cargo is being carried at rates equal to the Blue Book rates,
I tLi 30 7It was expected that by the middle of the summer the generalmarket rates might have fallen to or, oven below the Govern-mont Blue Book rates but this hope has not been realised inpractice.   The increased tonnage space left free by thereduction in Government cargo across the Atlantic in FebruaryIbrought about a rapid fall in the worth Atlantic rates (which to-day are the key rates of the world) but the downward tendency has been cheoked by the following unexpected difficult-ies which lessened the effective supply of tonnage in the market and very adversely affected the interplay of supply t, and demands-(A) Serious delays.in British and Foreign Ports consequent on labour difficulties and congestion of ports with    certain classes of cargo.(B) Serious disturbance of conditions by shortage ofthecoal and/threatened coal strike which held up a large numberof vessels and prevented others from coming to the United Kingdom.(0) Strikes of ship repairers extending over about two months at the time when extensive outfitting and conditioning for repatriation of troops was necessary.-2-
9 G(D) Continued large demand for tonnage for Army purposes; also unexpected expeditions to India, Russia,(E) UnexpeHed whoat shipments INTO India. (P) Increased cereal demand for Europe.It will be noted how large a share has been taken by Labour difficulties and disturbances in causing delays toi    shipping and the same root cause is to be seen in the unsatisfactory shipbuilding returns^   It was anticipated that approximately 2^000,000 tons would bo completed-this year but chiefly in consequence of indifferent work)unrest and other difficulties, as well as extensive repairs work to vessels damaged during the war* It looks probable that the completed figures will be reduced to about 1,000,000 ton&amp;*It la now expected that the world  tonnage will not equal the pre-war figure till the autumn of this year. In spite of these and other difficulties consider-able progress has been made.aiOjtSOO troops being repatriated from the various theatres of war( excluding the cross channel services) and taking the sailings arranged up to the    same date the position of the Dominion troops is estimated   as followsUp to 30th June conveyance has been arranged for

400and also owing-to tho shortage of coal.The Shipping Controller considers it has been in the interest of the country to create, extend, and latterly reduce such controls, but unless past progress is to bo wastedthe movement towards freedom must be continuous. In 1916 andwas Tpart of 1917 the movement/towards complete control, in the last half of 1917 there were few classes of commodities left freebut the movement though slower continued in the samo directionit1&apos;right up to the date of the Armistice.   Up to that date the problem included the difficulty of getting man-power to work on essential war trades.   After that date it included the difficulty of dealing with unemploymentrSince the Armistice the expansion and revival of commerce though very considerable has not yet been able to absorb all demobilised labour..The maintenance and existence of the 45,000,000 people in the United Kingdom in reasonable comfort depends entirely on the further expansion of commerce.   If the expansion is delayed or checked unemployment must increase until emigration, when this is possible, produces an equilibrium.Further, the control of commodities as exercised during
the war Involves the unduo restriction of British ships to British trades., and corresponding discouragement of foreign flag tonnage.   Before the wax&apos; British shipping was world wldo and British mercantile supremacy turned largely on that fact. At the same time large numbers of foreign ships came to our ports attracted by supplies of cheap coal, etc. The nearer we can approach to the pre-war position,(having our ships in foreign trades and foreign ships in our trades) the better It will be for British trade.   Before the war over one third of our imports were carried in foreign bottoms. Now out of a greatly reduced volume of imports only one seventh are so carried,It may be argued in some   quarters that the advantage of this policy must give way to the necessity of securing low prices.   In this connection tho following statement shows the small part played by freight in the total landed cost of some of the more Important food importsi-
402proportion,of freight la the landed cost of certain foodstuffs.Landed cost       Freight per lb, per lb..Wheat and Flour Bacon Tea SugarMeat (Plate) &quot;     (Australia) &quot;      (New Zealand)In these circumstances and for the above reasons, among others, the Shipping Controller considers that the general policy of His Majesty^ Government should be a8 follows:-(1)    To continue and extend the substitution of the machinery of private trade for that of Government control as regards commodities, and specially immediately to get free of all inter-allied organizations including wheat executive which are a drag and unfavourable to this country.b * d.2a31/6.4 1/3.13.47.17fd.L. &quot;3.621.618*2 2
(2)   As regards ships, to maintain control by ship licence until a world tonnege market has boen restored using the machinery of ship licence when necessary so as to secure reduced freights for essential commodities wherever the conditions of import are such as to secure the benefit of such reduction for the public, but otherwise, by giving the greatest possible freedom and fluidity to British tonnage, to aim at bringing down the -general world freight market.(5)   To relieve the competition for ships space as far as possible by a carefully devised system of regulation of imports.The Controller feels he cannot conclude this Memorandum without referring to the coal positionJjMchJie views with tho utmost, alarm and anxiety.In pre-war days the export of coal amounted to about 77,000,000 tons whereas under the   new conditions initiated by the Coal Controller it will be reduced to about 23,000,000 tons.The direct outcome of this will be that large    numbersof ships must leave the United Kingdom in ballast, foreigntonnage will largely cease to come, and the cost of the import of raw material must be greatly increased. On steel and ironthe influence will be very material.   During pre-war days-8-
-&apos; \ - 404the freight often did not exceed from North and South of Spain a cost of about 6/- per ton.   Such low basis of freights was consequent on our large -exports of coal to Italy, iioditerranean ports and France.   The outward freight paid the bulk of the expenses of the voyage and profit. Freights for ore for some time have been equal to about three times the pre-war freight and they have only been kopt from rising above this level because of the hi&amp;h   outward freights to Italy and Franco.It will interest members of the War Cabinet to know that ships which originally did this trade were generally valued at acmething between  5,000 and  20,000.    Old vessels were specially used for it but those were practically wiped out during the period of the war, being the glass of vessel which suffered most, whereas now the trade is being done to a great extent by vessels valued at  100,000 to  150,000 and the oost of working is something like three to four times more.Imports this year are estimated at about V&apos; *d less than pre-war times - say 35,000,000 to 40,000,000 against 55,000,000 to 60,000,000. Exports of goods will also be enormously down. What applies to ore for production of steel and iron applies equally to cereals for food purposes and other imports.   In the past the out ward freight paid a large proportion of the costof working ships and profit, but under new conditions the inward cargo wil^lar0the greater burden. 12th jmeJ19.
