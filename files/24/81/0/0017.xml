Unfortunately, the chief agitators in the Polioe and Prison Services remain.
POLICE! TJNRB3T.The threatened Poltoe Strike ended in a fiasoo.   , The ballot was partial only, no ballot papers having been sent to men who were likely to be loyal.    It is. therefore quite possible.that a.large number were in favour of a strike, but the; whole situation changed with the announcement of the extra pay and of the penalties that would be exaoted from the strikers.:   Moreover, the ISxeoutlve of the Polioe Union failed to secure a promise from the Triple Alliance that they would, come out in sympathy, and many Labour speaksr on whom they had counted for support deolined to speak at the Hyde Park Meeting on Sunday.    In one small Division alone where, during the strike last August, all exoept six of the subordinate ranks had come out, only three out of one hundred and thirty-five balloted for a strike.Throughout Saturday telephone messages were pouring in from the Provinces, and from these it appears that whole Forces had abandoned the Union or had decided to stand fast. Whereas on Saturday telegrams in code had been sent.to the Provinces calling out the men, on Sunday oode telegrams in the oontrary sense were despatched.Arrangements had been made in London and also in the Provinces to &quot;carry on&quot; in the event of a strike, and&apos;it is believed that London would have been perfectly safe even if three-quarters of the Regular men had left their duty and attempted to picket the remainder.The worst move made by the Union was the apology to the rioters who had attempted to force their way to the House of Commons, and responsible Labour leaders, seeing that the movement had got into t3ae hands of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; and revolutionaries such as carmichael, took alarm,    Neverthele; there was some promised support from Labour.    At Leeds the Municipal employees promised to oome out, and one or twoTrades/
my c-oiT^esiMmdeirbfl think that unless the men hud seen any benefit fcr themselves, they would not have been oontent to saorifioe wages for purely altruistio motives.    9?he Manohest workers were not ooming out, and the railwaymen on the lancashire, Yorkshireand Midland Railway would not have ocme out.    At Bradford the Police repudiated the Union in a body.During the agitation there was wild talk that the Prison Warders would throw open the prison gates and liberate all tb prisoners.NEED FOR PROPAGANDA.My1 Yorkshire correspondent again lays stress on the benefit that would result from the visit of a few good speakers to enlighten the working men on the dangers of striking and the difficulties enoountered by the Government 1 providing for the employment of returned soldiers. &apos;THE HOUSING QUESTION.Thore is still much agitation about the delay in taokli, the housing question, and meetings were held in Newcastle an Gateshead on the 1st. June, at whioh the speakers showed muoh Irritation,    It is understood that tke Local Authoritl are now really beginning to move,&apos;THE LIQUOR CONTROL BOARD.In Durham, Northumberland, and lancashire , the beer question is still aoute, and until it is smoothed over my correspondents think that the men will not settle down to work.    They demand the abolition of the Liquor Control board and the restoration of pre-war rights and privileges. Alderman Leese, J.P, ,   auid that he would be prepared tosuppo;
(English) - 3/- &apos;support a &quot;down tools&quot; policy unless this was done.THE INCOME! TAX. - &apos;I referred last week to the agitation for raising the exempted inoome to  250 a year.   At a meeting at Pontypridd, Councillor A.J. Cooke urged that all demand notes should be returned to the Chancellor with compliments.    A resolution was read to the effeot that the miners should not pay taxes on inoomes less than  $00.mm party.At a Conference of the North Eastern Federation of the Labour Party at Newcastle on May 24th there was considerable disorder.    A resolution demanding the withdrawal of troops from Russia and the raising of who blockade was proposed, and it is stated, was passed unanimously.THIS IMPENDENT LABOUR PARTY.JSx-Priv&amp;te Simmonds hag again.oome into prominence by the violence of his language.  His audiences, however, are small, and as long as he continues, to refer to the Government as &quot;that bloodstained crowd at Whitehall&quot;, his influenoe will remain negligible.   Though a discharged soldier, he was not accepted as a member by the Discharged and Demobilised Sailors&apos; and Soldiers! Union, ,A meeting held at Liverpool on May 28th, to oppose oonsoription, was poorly attended. .WQMfiN&apos;8 INTERN&quot; AT 101&apos; AL LSAGUE. ,.This League has held several meetings, but the speeches are not worth reporting.  Miss fivelyn Sharp, of Suffragette notoriety, deolared that the League stood for very muoh the same policy as Bela Kun is setting up in Hungary to-day -one of the finest Governments &quot;in principle&quot; that had ever
(English)been set up by Socialists,in the history of the world.   This League requires no other comment.   It is showing slides of starving children whioh are said to be vouched for by a Geneva Sooiety.   Suoh photographs are, of oourse, obtainable in any ohiWs hospital in this country.LOUDOK WORKERS&apos; COMMITTEE: There appear to be differences between W, P. Watson and his oommittee. The dispute is temporarily settled, but there is a soreness.The West London Branch is appealing for money to carry on a revolutionary bookshop.The Committee is said to ,be removing to the CommuniBt ; Club, though it is still holding its Wednesday Classes at Featherstone Buildings.FEDERATION OF DISCHARGED AND DEMOBILISED SAILORS AtjD SOLDIERS. A well informed correspondent draws a disquieting pioture of this body.   He says that many Branohes are ripe for a row, and an agitator would reoelve every encouragement, Many of the men, especially the hooligan element in London, do not want work, and think that they should be maintained by the Government for the rest of their lives.   Men turn&apos;* &apos; v.-down jobs at  2 a week on the ground that It is equivalent only to 1.6&apos;b. before the War.   Some of their grievances are genuine.   Their wives, who have been earning big wages, are now out of employment, and they fire very angry to find women in Government employment.   During the demonstration in Hyde Park any woman driver who passed wr,s greeted with shouts of &quot;Pull her off.   The men claim that if the Government would set the example, Municipalities and private employers would follow suit and discharge their women..On/
P On the night of Sunday, the 1st, there was a disturbanceat Wolverhampton headed by discharged soldiers, in consequence of the arrest of an ex-soldier for drunkenness.   It is stated that some of the hotheads are aiming at a revolution, and that they are armed.   In this connection it is worth noting that in view of Labour unrest the New Zealand Government is passing speoial legislation against the oarrying of firearms.Prom a conversation between two members of the Federation in a train it was gathered that there is an intention of making another raid on the House of Commons,THE BAKERS1 UNION   -  -Preparations are believed to be in progress for a strike of bakers in the Bast End of London,   Secret meetings with this objeot were held on the 26th and 28th May,   The object is not better working oonditions, but the furtherance of Bolshevik propaganda.   The instructions are to work oautiously and to pass instructions from.mouth to mouth, but never in the presence of a third party.   The Committee is composed of men of Bolshevik views,COMRADES I BUSINESS LEAGUEThis League, formed about four months ago, is composed principally of ex-soldiero and sailors,   The objeots are to get an inorease in the allowances to disabled men and to reotify oases of injustioe.   Mr. Chandley, 26&quot;, Bertham Road, South Hackney, is the secretary, and the headquarters are at 275, Mare Street, Hackney,SAILORS1 . SOLDIERS 1 AND AIRMEN&apos;S UNIONThis Union is making a wild appeal for funds through extremist newspapers and oiroular letters to Trades Unions, i carmichael/
Oarmlohael, of the London Trades Council, was to preside at a meeting held on the 2nd for merging this Union with the National Union.of Ex-Service Men,&apos; - The. off ices at 2, Vihitefriars, Street are to be olosed, and the premises of the British Socialist Party will be the future office.THE TRIPLB ALLIANCEThe Southport resolutions (Consoription, the Blockade, Intervention in Rupsia, Conooientious Objeotors, the Income Tax, and the &quot;Secret Circular&quot;) having been rejected by the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, are now to be hawked through the country.   The Triple Allianoe agitators will not let the matter drop.Mr, Robert Blatohfr-id points out in the &quot;Clarion&quot; the difference between an ordinary strike and a strike against the State.   In the letter otise he justifies the use of the Army, Navy, a,nd Police, and is confident that the Government would have the support of the public.THE RAILWAYMANThere appears.to. be an incipient movement among the railwaymen in Lancashire for claiming an eight hour day inoluding meal-time&amp;. V.     &apos;   Complaints are made against the London and NorthWestern Railway of employing discharged soldiers:: in prefereij &apos;to railwaymen .of two years&apos; standing.   The Ilford, West Hendon, and Wembley  ranches of the National Union (N.U.R.) have been making protests against Conscription and Interven tion in Russia. 1 IAt Salisbury the Branch is affiliating with the Trades1 ;:      and &quot;Labour Counoil, and West Hendon with the LandNationalisation Society. 0There&quot; is a growing tendency in the Triple Allianoe touse/

Trouble is expected with workers.on the Clyde in the Autumn.- At present their wives will not let them strike, as all arrangements are made for the holidays,JOHN MoLEAN  :At a meeting of the British Socialist Party on May 26th, with his usual extravagance, John MoLean deolared himself to be the &apos;l.enin&apos; of England, and said that he would die fighting against the Capitalists of this oountry.Mi;. JOSEPH KING, late M.P.Though no longer to be heard in the House of Commons, it may be gathered from the following extract from a letter that Mr. Joseph King is doing his duty aooording to his lights&quot;I an doing my utmost to make men realise how brutally unjust the peace Terms are.&quot;He goes1&apos; on to attack British Military Imperialism and president &quot;Wilson.   In addition to the I.L.P. pamphletNo, 7 i &quot;Soviets&quot;, Mr, King has written articles for &quot;TheHuddersfield/Worker&quot;-, the &quot;Bradford Pioneer&quot;, and &quot;the worker&quot;,   To the last named he contributed on apology forBolshevism, entitled &quot;Give the Bolshevik Devils their due.&quot;MISS 3ELVIA PAMHPRST * \-A meeting was held at 400, Old Ford Road last Thursday to raise  200 for an agitation in the dooks to get the mento/

Tom Mann is to be employed as an agitator.THE &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot;,The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; is.on sale at the following places : in the Worth of PranceDunkirk Huoqueliers AmiensEtaples Lille ValenoiennesPiennes Aire s/Lys ParisDouai Calais ;   Boulogne.It allows its agents full rates for returns on oonditionthat they send back the portion bearing the name and date.No other English paper does this, therefore this actionof the &quot;Herald&quot; is a strong inducement to Frenchnewsvendors to push the sales.My Liverpool correspondent states that the sales are increasing in Lancashire, andt that since the disclosuresre the Army and the Polioe. the demand has gone up 500 peroent.   On the other hand, I have reoeived information, notyet confirmed, that the proprietors approached Bomanjee,the Indian extremist politician, for finanoial aid.   Inthis they were unsuccessful, but it is said that Tilakhas recently subscribed  5,000.- i &apos;&quot; V&apos;,-&apos;&apos;&apos;&quot;THE WORKER&quot;.A leading article in &quot;The Worker&quot; (24th May, 1919),the organ of the Workers1 Committee in Sootland, contains the following passages&apos;    &quot;Wage the class war relentlessly ........ponVt look for quarter, you won&apos;t get it? don&apos;t give any, they don5t deserve it.   Let the acid of olass hatred enter into your vitals, let it oiroulate through your veins, don&apos;t try to oheck it in any way, don&apos;t strangle it in its embryonic stage of crudity, but fan the flames into suoh a roaring fire of hate fcvt not even a oruoible could withstand its, heat.   Remember the pitilessness of Capitalism in the past.   Peterloo, Tonypandy, $ Peatherstone, Belfast, Dublin, Leith, and a hostof other outrages on the workers must be avenged.Remember/
Remember the legions of workers who have been sacrificed to the God of Mammon - the workers who fought for you, who risked everything on your behalf, the workers who were oast into dungeons, who were transported to orime girt islands, who were hanged, quartered, and drawn, the workers wno were tortured until they became miserable wreoks unfit for anything, martyrs of past generations, aye! martyrs of this generation, each and all of thorn ory aloud for vengeance.  Let the iron enter into your soul&quot;., ,  It is a question how far the Authorities ought toallow such incitements to go,5,000 oopies of the June issue whioh is to be published at 2d. have been ordered by the Sailors&apos;, Soldiers1 and airmenfs Union.   In this issue the. Union changes its ground and disolaims having taken any part in inducing men to refuse duty on May 11th.   It also denies that provoking oamp riots or organising meetings is any part of its policy.  This appears to show that it has lost muoh ground by its notion in the early part of May.The week ending May 26th was comparatively quiet. There appeared to be signs of a split in the Sinn Fein Party in the North. There are still agrarian troubles in the West.Public feeling towards the Police and in some places towards the Military is bad, and the Sinn Feiners have abandoned the hope of winning over the Police to their  , side.The refusal of the^ American representatives at the Peaoe Conference to support the Irish American Delegation is embarrassing the Sinn Fein Executive, who will haveto/
