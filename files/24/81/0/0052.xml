(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITABTIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.)s8cr b-t;WAR CABINET.STATS (MJm Iff aid of JCAIKTWAKCE allowancesjgg pupils pjlacesTf higher education.Menorandum &quot;by the President of the Board of Education,19 When the Education Aci of 1918 was in Committeea good deal was said, especially &quot;by members of the Labour Party, as to the necessity for more general and adequate provision of maintenaeeeallowances to enable poor and promising children to follow courses of higher education.    Local Education, Authorities have for some time had power to provide scholarships for children over the age of twelve, and a provision was inserted in the Act of 1918 declaring that the power to provide scholar-ships included a power to proTide maintenance allowances.2. It is undeniable that if facilities for higher education provided by Local Education Authorities, with the assistance of the State, are to be really and widely accessible to promising children of all classes it is necessary that maintenance allowances should be provided.     It is also undeniable that a great deal of money spent out of the rates and the taxes on the provision of Secondary Schools and other insti-tutions of higher education is thrown away because many of the pupils who attend them stay for so short a time, and therefore do not comijlete or derive full benefit from their courses of education.    Many parents are willing to make great sacrifices for the education of their children, but as the pupil grows older his or her value as a potential wage-earner increases, and the sacrifice entailed on the parents by keeping the child at school becomes more severely felt.    There can be no doubt that the mischief of leaving school prematurely is largely due to the insufficiency and uneven provision of maintenance allowances.3. Some Local Education Authorities exercise their powers liberally, but in a very large number of areas the provision is most inadequate, and the children living in them are without the opportunities which they would enjoy elsewhere.     LTo State aid is at present given for this purpose, and there can be no doubt at all that if progress is to be made throughout the country towards a reasonable standard of provision of maintenance allowances State aid is essential.     I therefore propose that a State Grant,, at the rate of $0 per cent, of expenditure incurred by Local Education Authorities under arrangements, approved by the Board, for pro-viding maintenance allowances tenable at institutions of higher education, Bhould be established.     In order, however, to protect the Treasury against extravagance,, or an indefinite expansion of the grant, I propose that in each area the total grant should not exceed the sum . of three shillings per head of the children in the area
who are attending public&apos;elementary schools.    This limiting- figure is purely an index figure;   hut representing as it docs the density.of the population which uses public elementary schools and which therefore prima facie is likely to require maintenance allowances, it is not inappropriate.&apos;   Under this limit,, if all Local Education Authorities wero to qualify for the maximu: grant, the State expenditure could not exceed  78-7 -,500P On the basis of the present expenditure it is estimated that the grant might in the first year amount to  250,000.*   Under the operation of Section 44 of the Education Act, 1918, which lays down the principle that, where the total State grants amount to loss than half the Local Education authority&apos;s expenditure on elementary and higher education respectively, the difference shall be made up by means of a deficiency grant, any substantive grant in aid of maintenance allowances will operate to diminish the amount of deficiency grant in those areas in which it is payable.    A very large share of the deficiency grant if payable in London, and it is in London that the expenditure on maintenance allowances is, and is likely to \]q9 greatest,,      In this and s ome -other areas therefore, the effect of the new grant in aid of maintenance allowances will he merely to transfer the State expenditure from one head to another, but it&apos; is not posri&amp;Ie at present to determine with any exact-ness how much of the proposed new grant wilxfmerely a substitute for deficiency grant otherwise ^payable,I bring the matter before the Government be-cause I consider that it is one of social policy and of great importance in the interests of the Nation. It is universally recognised that for purposes of citizenship5 as well as of industry, every endeavour must be made to educate the people.    For this purpose the system of public education, on which the State spends; very large sums, must be made more accessible to all classes, and further&quot;security must be taken that the State Obtains-full value for its expenditure.    It is useless to&quot; spend money on providing courses of higher education Unless those who begin them are enabled ,to complete them.Prom the political point of view it is very desirable that the grant which I propose should be established at once, and that a supplementary estimate should be taken for the purpose.      If no provision of this kind ia made this year I think it is certain that the Government will have to face a good deal of criticism.(Intd.)H. A. L. P.Board of Education, Whitehall,S.1*10th Juno 1919.
