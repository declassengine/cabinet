Extension op Agreements by Legal Sanction.It will be remembered that the extension of agreements to non-federated firms was one of the subjects considered by the Industrial Council in 1912, the terms of reference including the question &quot;&apos; How far, and in what manner, industrial agreements which are made between representative bodies of employers and of workmen should be enforced throughout a particular tracle or district.&quot; The Report of the Council was in general in favour of extension of agreements, subject to certain safeguards, such as the agreement being a proper one and full opportunity being given to firms likely to be affected to state their views prior to extension. Since the date of that enquiry, however, the position has to some extent been altered by the fact that the Unions have become more strongly organised and are therefore more able, by their own efforts, to secure the observance of settlements by non-federated employers. Nevertheless the difficulty has remained a substantial one, as is shown by the fact that power had to be taken by the Minister of Munitions to extend awards under the Munitions of War Act 1917, and by the Minister of Labour to extend awards or approved agreements or settlements, under the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act, 1918.(0 1806)   150 6/19  h k s ASECRET. G.T. 7457.
2*   4The following Orders making binding an agreement or award on the whole of an industry have been made under the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act:-(1) India Rubber, No. 635 ; (2) Asbestos, No. G34; (3) Women in Engineering Shops, Boiler Shops and Foundries, No. 260 ; (4) Women in Wonien&apos;s Clothing Trades, No. 357. (This is a somewhat different kind of Order, but for the present purpose the same considerations apply.) There are also under consideration Orders in the following trades : (1) Commercial Carting. An Order for the London District has just been signed, and similar Orders will be applied for in other districts. (2) Shirt and Collar Trade, and the Clothing Trade. (Now before the Interim Court and the Appropriate Trade Boards.) (3) Tin Box Trade. (About to be referred to the Court.) (4) Leather Trade : (a) Harness and Fancy Leather Goods; (b) Leather Belting. (Joint Industrial Council settlement.) (5) Hosiery. (Joint Industrial Council settlement.) (6) Wool. Northern Counties (Joint Industrial Council settlement).   (7) Furniture Trade in London.Some experience thus is available as a result of administration connected with the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act, and it may be worth while to summarise the main . points that have arisen.(1) A difficulty of some general significance has arisen in connection with the dis-tinction between a prescribed and a substituted rate. A prescribed rate is defined as &quot; the recognised time rate or other basis for determining wages . . . generally applicable,&quot; on 11th November, 1918, while the substituted rate is any rate thereafter substituted by the Interim Court of Arbitration for the prescribed rate. It has in the administration of the Act hitherto been assumed that while a prescribed rate is binding on all employers in a trade in a district, a substituted rate is binding only on the parties to it, unless an Order extending it lias been made under Section 2 (3) of the Act. It is open to question, however, under Section 1 (1) whether the substituted rate should not be binding on precisely the same people as the prescribed rate. In that section it is stated that any person employing, &amp;c. . . . shall pay not less than the prescribed rate or such other rate as.may be substituted. If the latter interpretation is correct the object of Section 2 (3) might be held to be that, in a district where a national settlement affected only a minority of employers ^and it was desirable to bring the wages of the whole trade in that district under the national settlement, an Order applicable specifically, to that district should be made. The necessity for making Orders would, however, largely disappear. This particular difficulty is, of course, a temporary one, due to the require-ments of the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act.(2)-It is undesirable that agreements reached between federated bodies should be applied to other persons in the trade without giving the latter an opportunity of expressing their views before the settlement becomes binding on them. This is an important point, especially in view of the present position of the Joint Industrial Councils. Some of these are more representative than others. In the Woollen Trade, for instance, the Joint Industrial Council covers practically the whole ground. In the Vehicle Trade, however, not only are important districts unrepresented, but a large section of the trade, viz., engineering firms engaged for part of their time on the manufacture of vehicles, are un-represented. It is obviously extremely difficult to make binding on a trade in a district where the firms represented by the Joint Industrial Council are non-existent or in a minority, a settlement which includes important engineering firms in a majority. The remedy, of course, is to secure that the Joint Industrial Councils, before their recom-mendations are accepted, really represent the trade, but as things stand they are not unnaturally claiming that such legal sanction as is possible should be given to their arrangements,(3) To some extent the difficulty (indicated in (2) supra) is bound up with the question of the definition of particular trades ; when an agreement is entered into between a Trade Union and an Employers&apos; Association, its terms are binding upon the members of the association, i.e., the agreement covers certain specific establishments. When, however, it is proposed to extend such an agreement to the whole &quot; trade &quot; the question at once arises what establishments are to be included, and where is the line to be drawn ? Thus an agreement, is entered into between the London Master Carters and the Trade Unions fixing wages for the carting trade. What is a carter ? Should the&apos; agreement be enforced upon all employers who employ men to drive horses, retail drapers, furniture removers, butchers, bakers, &amp;c. ?  If not, who is to be included, and who excluded ?(4)&apos; The practice of the Department under the current interpretation of the Act has been to approve otherwise proper agreements under Section 1 (1), which approval makes them binding on the parties to the settlement, and then to take the advice of the Court under Section 2 (3) on the extension of the settlement to non-federated firms.   The Court
for this purpose holds a public hearing. It is often difficult to find the firms concerned, and in such cases the only step which can be taken is to put an advertisement in suitable newspapers. In practice this notice has attracted very few people to the hearing, and it cannot be said that the parties who would be affected by an Order have really made any serious representations. This is important, because Orders made on incomplete informa-tion of this kind might on occasion lead to difficulties. The case of the Women&apos;s Clothing Order, for instance, illustrates this. The hearing of the Court was duly announced, but beyond the Federations and Trade Unions few others were present ; while at the hearings of the Shirt and Clothing cases it is understood that there was a complete absence of representatives of non-federated firms.(5) Another important consideration is the position of small firms outside a federa-tion and in rural areas. It is difficult to expect a small vehicle builder or a small carter in a country district to pay the minimum rates applicable in the big towns where the cost of living is much higher. The issue of an Order which is binding on such firms would probably in some cases cause serious disturbance to their business and might have the effect of closing local avenues of employment.(6) Section 2 (3) of the Act reads as follows : &quot; Where an award determining or varying a rate has been so made by the Interim Court of Arbitration, or an agreement or settlement for such purpose has been arrived at, the Minister of Labour may, on the advice of the Interim1 Court of Arbitration, by order direct that the determination or variation effected by the award, agreement, or settlement shall be binding on all workmen to whom the prescribed rate in question is applicable and the employers of those workmen.&quot;It will be observed that the only matters that can be extended under the Act are determinations of prescribed or substituted rates or the fixing of new substituted rates. Agreements as to hours, for example, cannot as such be extended. This gave rise to a certain amount of difficulty in the Commercial Carting case. An agreement for a 48-hour week was reached and urgent representations as to its extension to the whole industry were made. The parties then had to be instructed to produce supplementary agreements showing, by districts, the substituted rates brought about by the shorter working week. In the Flour Milling industry a similar policy was adopted, wdth the result that the employers decided not to proceed with the request for an Order.(7) The Act, as regards men, applies only to those who already had prescribed rates as defined in the Act. There are considerable bodies of men, especially in unorganised trades and also partly in organised trades, where prescribed rates do not exist. If prescribed rates did not exist, there could not be any claim for substituted rates, or agreements or settlements fixing substituted rates, and accordingly such workpeople have no claims under the Act. This difficulty occurred in the Lace Industry and resulted eventually in the parties, while at first denying that any prescribed rates existed, subsequently changing their minds and insisting that prescribed rates did exist. The Department have in practice given a broad interpretation to the Act in this respect and have frequently passed over this point rather than raise difficulties. In a number of cases there are standard war advances as distinct from standard rates.(8) A further difficulty is the manner in which agreements are drawn up. It is obvious that if statutory effect is to be given to an agreement its terms must be perfectly clear and definite. The agreements are often vague and difficult to construe, but it is hoped that the steps now being taken will minimise that difficulty.(9) Mention may perhaps be made of another difficulty which has come to notice, and which illustrates the care with which agreements need to be scrutinised before they can properly be extended. An agreement was arrived at under the auspices of the North Western Building Trade Conciliation Board (the parties to which include the Master Builders&apos; Federations and practically all the trade unions connected with the building trade), which provided for certain rates of wages to be paid to the various classes of work-people covered by the Conciliation Board. This agreement was submitted by the Con-ciliation Board for the approval of the Minister of Labour in accordance with the terms of the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act. Subsequently the Plumbers&apos; Industrial Council (which is representative of the Master Plumbers and of the Operative Plumbers) arrived at an agreement covering a considerable proportion of the area covered by the North Western Conciliation Board agreement, but fixing a rate of wages for Plumbers which differed from the rate agreed upon for Plumbers by the North Western Area Board. The Plumbers&apos; agreement was also submitted to the Minister for approval.  It is to be
noted that the Plumbers, both employers and operatives, were parties to the general North Western agreement.It will be seen that the experience of the administration of the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act indicates that the question of the legal enforcement of wages upon the whole of a trade is far from being a simple matter. There are, of course, also many questions of policy (such as the effect upon the consumer of the elimination of compe-tition) which must be considered.Part II. Demobilization and Resettlement.Nil.Part III. Press Comments. (1) Labour and Socialist Press. (A). Foreign Affairs.The Peace Proposals.(a) Austrian Peace Terms.-The proposed peace terms with Austria excite little cdmment, when a comparison is made with the voluminous discussions upon the German Peace Terms. The &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; and the Merthyr &quot; Pioneer &quot; dismiss them as in full accord with the terms proposed to Germany. Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; describes them as &quot; sheer and unadulterated brigandage.&quot; Such other papers as mention the proposals merely summarise their terms.(b) German Counter-Proposals. The &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; maintains that the German Counter-Proposals are in full accord with President Wilson&apos;s speeches, pledges and under-takings. Mr. Hyndman in &quot; Justice &quot; discusses what may be described as &quot; the condition of Germany question.&quot; He doubts whether the poverty of Germany at present is as dire as it has been said to be in some quarters ; but he agrees that the banking system of the country has utterly broken down.(c) Labour and the Peace. Mr. Ben Tillett in the &quot; Democrat &quot; attacks an unofficial manifesto which he says is being circulated for signature among Labour Leaders. He maintains that Kaiserism is still in existence in Germany, and answers the argument that Germany is being starved by the assertion that ten millions of our people are wanting proper food. He trusts that no false sentimental generosity towards Germany (in the matters of reparation and food supplies) will blind labour to the needs of our own fellow citizens. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; publishes some fragments of criticism on the Labour Convention and matters connected with it which have been made by a deputation of American seamen to Paris, and expresses its opinion that this Labour Convention is a highly reactionary document, full of the most obvious flaws. The &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; in a leading article, says that the Peace Terms are a challenge to Labour and International Socialism, and calls upon the Labour Party to declare definitely and clearly that its first work as a Government would be to&apos; undo the &quot; treacherous betrayal of democracy which the Allied Junkers have perpetrated.&quot; &quot; Rob Roy &quot; in &quot; Forward &quot; repeats his conditional approval of the Peace Terms and the League of Nations. Europe, he says, reconstructed on the lines laid down and with a League of Nations operating, will be a vast improvement on the Europe of the past: but he asks for more detailed.information in order that he may assure himself that the reparation proposals will not involve a degradation of the standard of living for every German man, women and child for the next generation.Russia.The &quot; New Statesman &quot; concludes that the policy of intervention in Russia has broken down before the logic of facts\ TheLabour Leader &quot; alleges that in France, America, Greece and Italy an effective protest has been made against intervention in Russia and, as a result, the soldiers and sailors of these countries are being withdrawn from Russia : it asserts that our own soldiers are being compelled to march onPetrograd, and calls for a similar effective protest here.
Other.The &quot; Nation &quot; contains an article by Mr. Bertrand Russell in which he maintains that the Labour movement must be international&quot; [i.e. must include America) or else it will be doomed to failure. The &quot; British Citizen &quot; compares the situations of Dantzic and Fiume in order to show that those who both object to an Italian regime in Frame and support a Polish regime in Dantzic are inconsistent.(B) Home Affairs.&quot; Protection.&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;Mr. Hyndman maintains in &quot; Justice &quot; that the differential duties against Chinese and Japanese tea are serving to give the English producers in India a big bonus, and that the preference is as &quot; politically fatuous as economically it is unjustifiable.&quot; Mr. F. W. Jowetfs article, in the &quot; Pioneers &quot; of Merthyr and Bradford, is mainly a criticism of Sir Auckland Geddes and the Board of Trade for their proposals for the encouragement of English industry.Labour Legislation.The &quot; New Statesman &quot; hopes that agreed bills dealing with hours and minimum wage scales will be secured without delay and passed into law. Otherwise it prophesies a serious situation in the autumn. With regard to the &quot; Pre-War Practices Restoration (No. 3) Bill,&quot; the &quot; New Statesman &quot; admits that the Bill may have results not entirely advantageous to women and semi-skilled labour in certain trades, but maintains that this consideration cannot affect the obligation to restore the skilled workers to the position they voluntarily surrendered during the war. The sooner the Bill becomes law, the sooner, it says, will the Trade Unions and employers be able to discuss the necessary industrial readjustments and consider the claims of the workers who were not parties to the original contract. Mr.&quot; Philip Snowden adopts similar views in the &quot; Labour Leader.&quot; The &quot; British Citizen &quot; asserts that the Bill will require careful consideration in Committee. The &quot; Democrat &quot; insists that reconstruction cannot be done in a hurry and urges its readers to learn the great lesson that the &quot; quick-change-artist principle of legislation introduced during the war had many failings.&quot;Unemployment and the Donation.Sir Leo Chiozza Money in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; explains the Socialist objection to &quot; unemployment doles &quot; ; and the same paper urges the Government to organise public works to provide unemployment, and calls upon the I.L.P. to insist upon work being pro-vided, or, in default of this, upon adequate maintenance. The &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; says that the rule by which a man must have been employed for 20 weeks in the course of 1918 in order to qualify for the donation is unfair upon a man who may have been out of work owing to an illness or an accident during that time, and it asks for an amendment in the regulations to cover a case of this kind. This paper congratulates the Employment Exchanges for the arrangement by which sundry winders, warpers and reelers in Ashton, who were disqualified on technical grounds (owing to their own misunderstanding) for the . receipt of the donation on account of part of the 12-day stoppage at Easter, will receive the donation morally due to them. The &quot; New Age &quot; thinks that Sir Robert Home was too optimistic in the estimate of prospects of employment which, he made in. the House of Commons on 28th May. It maintains that even if the bulk of the ex-servioe men were to be absorbed into industry by the end of the summer, this would merely result in the unemployment of women and old men, whose places they would have taken.Mines and Miners.The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; asserts that it is part of the coalowners&apos; policy to make conditions as bad as possible for the worker ; it alleges that many skilled miners are out of work, and urges the Miners&apos; Federation to force the employment of every miner at the minimum wage rate. This paper also moralises upon Royal Commissions. They tend, it maintains, to divert attention to the question of what may or may not be done for the workers by the Government, from the question of what the workers can achieve for themselves. the Triple Alliance, the Trade Union Congress and the Labour Party.Mr. Philip Snowden in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; says that the Trade Union Congress Parliamentary Committee in refusing to call a conference to deal with the so-called South-port resolutions has thrown down a challenge to the Labour movement.  He regards Mr.
Bonar Law&apos;s speech to the deputation of the Parliamentary Committee as most unsatis-factory, and alleges that the decision of the Committee lias caused consternation in the ranks of Labour. The &quot; New Age &quot; rs equally critical. The &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; concludes that the balance of reasoning is in favour of the decision of the Committee. It points out that it would be ultra vires for a special conference of the T.U.C. to order a strike, and that it could only pass pious resolutions. With regard to industrial action, it asks whether the cotton operatives in particular could strike now on these political matters in the midst of their present agitation for higher wages and shorter hours. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; goes further than Mr. Snowden and the &quot; New Age.&quot; In its opinion not only has the Parliamentary Committee failed ignominiously, but the Triple Alliance has failed also. The Executive of the Triple Alliance, it maintains, is reactionary and timid, and, in addition, has no real power. It cannot act without the rank and file, and the &quot; Workers&apos;Dreadnought &quot; urges that the time for the rank and file to assert themselves is now. The London Workers&apos; Conference summoned for 14th June presents, it says, a splendid opportunity for those who are working to bring the &quot; industrial power of Labour into conflict with the forces of reaction &quot; ; it calls upon the conference to confront the Triple Alliance and the Labour Party, when they meet at Southport, with a fait accompli. Ihe &quot; Clarion &quot; with reference to this same question, says that the Labour Party must make itself clear as to the right of individual trade unions to forestall its decisions and to commit it to political aims and methods ; but the &quot; Call &quot; echoes the sentiments of the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; and the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; supports Mr. William Lunn in his attitude, which is that the Parliamentary Labour Party must take a more determined attitude to be in line with the rank and file of organised labour.Industrial versus Political Action.This last matter has received a great deal of attention this week, and some of the papers proceed to discuss the political principles involved in the problem. Thus the &quot; New Age &quot; reviews the political and industrial situation. With regard to the political situation, it thinks that the intelligence of the Labour Party is hardly equal to the task it has assumed of Parliamentary opposition. Therefore, this paper is not surprised that Mr. Straker and the industrial leaders of the Triple Alliance are disposed to turn from Parliament altogether and to threaten industrial action against it. Having thus explained why the temptation to employ the organised force of the Triple Alliance in this manner is so strong, the &quot; New Age &quot; nevertheless expresses the opinion that such direct action would be of dubious value, even if it were to succeed, and it does not think it would succeed. It maintains that industrial forces must be concentrated on industrial reconstruction, upon which the political reconstruction would automatically follow. In &quot;Forward&quot; Mr. Ramsay Mac-donald explains and justifies the so-called &quot; Soviet &quot; system for Russia, but in this country he maintains there is no need for revolution nor for Soviets. The working classes,-he says, have already the political power in their own hands, and the only thing necessaiy is their realisation of this fact. Mr. John Bryan in the &quot; Call &quot; disagrees with this verdict. Parliament, he maintains, is not a source of political or social progress. He points out how, in his opinion, a Labour majority in Australia failed to do anything, and thinks that the &quot; Soviet &quot; system has finally made clear the failure of &quot; Parliamentarism.&quot; On the other side, both the &quot;Democrat&quot; and the &quot;British Citizen&quot; quote with approval Mi\ Clynes&apos; article in the &quot; Observer &quot; of 31st May, in which he said that &quot; Labour had nothing to fear more than making the country fear Labour &quot; ; and the &quot; British Citizen &quot;addresses an expose of Bolshevism to the British sympathisers with, and would-be imitators of, Russia It may be noted that the &quot; Railway Review,&quot; the official organ of the N.U.R., also discusses Trade Unionism, but only in furtherance of its campaign against craft unionism in the railway shops.(2) The Press on Demobilization and Resettlement.Demobilization Unrest in Egypt.The &quot; Daily Herald &quot; (4th June) alleges that unrest is spreading among the British Expeditionary Force in Egypt in protest against delay in demobilization and that Soldiers&apos; Councils have been formed. No unconstitutional action has been taken, but a general strike is reported to be threatening. ^Unemployment and Public Works.In the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; (5th June) Sir Leo Chiozza Money contends that the Govern-ment can put in hand more strictly economic work than there are workers to accomplish.
Instead of using the national factories and the stores and means of transport which the war has given us, &quot; we put&apos; all up for sale and are spending tens of thousands in the incontinent disposal of national capital.&quot; Similar arguments are advanced in a leading article in the same issue of the paper.The Restoration of the Pre-War Practices Bill.&quot; The Common Cause &quot; (6th June), in discussing the Restoration of Pre-War Practices Bill, complains of the indifference shown in the debates in the House to the interests of women workers. It argues that the exclusion of women from industry is the chief pre-war custom which it is intended to restore, and emphasises the view suggested by Mr. Clynes that the bill, which was arranged by employers and the recognised unions, ignores the workers in other groups and the rest of the community.Part IV. General Topics and District Reports.(1) General.Coal Commission.. The Coal Commission held sittings on the 4th, 5th and 6th June. On the 4th June Mr. Justice Sankey presented a number of returns in regard to the output of coal, which had been furnished by the Coal Controller. On the 6th Sir Richard Redmayne, Chief Inspector of Mines, gave further evidence with regard to output and other matters. Evidence was also heard from Mr. C. W. Bowerman, M.P. (as to the opinion of trade unionists with regard to nationalisation as shown by the resolutions of the Trade Union Congress), Mr. Frederick Mills (Managing Director of the Ebbw Vale Steel, Iron and Coal Co.), Mr. J. H. Bowden (Poplar Electricity Department), Dr. G. Knox (Principal of the South Wales School of Mines), Lord Haldane, Lord Devonport (Chairman of the Port of London Authority), Dr. Walter Leaf (Chairman of the London Clearing Bankers), Sir Hugh Bell (National Federation of Iron and Steel Manufacturers), Sir Lionel Phillips (Chairman of the Central Mining and Investment Corporation), Mr. D. E. M. Watson (President of the National Gas Council), Mr. J. J. Terrett (Secretary of the National Food Vigilance Com-mittee),Mr. C. T. Cramp (President of the National Union of Railwaymen), Mr. A. Pugh (General Secretary of the Iron and Steel Trade Confederation), and others.Resolutions against the nationalisation of coal have been passed by the British Empire Producers&apos; Association, the Parliamentary Committee of the Hull Chamber of Commerce, the Council of the Bradford Chamber of Commerce, and the Batley and Birstall Chamber of Commerce.&apos;Resolutions that no definite recommendation should be made by the Commission, or that no legislation should be effected, till the opinion of manufacturers and various associa-tions had received full consideration have been passed by the Bradford Chamber of Commerce, the Coventry Chamber of Commerce, and the Committee of the Swansea Royal Jubilee Metal Exchange.A.committee of Members of Parliament has been formed to hold meetings at regular intervals in order closely to watch developments in connection with the coal industry.Coal Miners.The Miners&apos; Federation Executive is reported to have decided to make some effort to resuscitate the Miners&apos; International.Conferences between the Northumberland Coal Owners&apos; Association and the Miners&apos; Association for the purpose of formulating schemes for the operation of the Sankey Award are reported to be proceeding amicably.The Executive Committee of the Rhymney Valley Miners&apos; Association is protesting against the alleged action of certain coal owners in inducing men to transfer from the Miners&apos; Federation to the Master Hauliers&apos; Union. This protest is significant in view of the campaign, referred to in last week&apos;s Report, which is being carried on by the miners&apos; leaders in South Wales, for compelling all colliery workers to join the Miners&apos; Federation.Transport Workers.The annual meeting of the General Council of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation was held at Swansea on the 5th and 6th June. The President, Mr. Harry Gosling, in his opening address, stated that the Federation would not associate itself with the National Industrial Council,  which it regarded as only a temporary expedient
to checkmate the workers&apos; demands. The main importance of the meeting lay in the discussion that took place with regard to the policy of the Triple Alliance in threatening industrial action to secure political results. Mr. Havelock Wilson, after criticising Mr. Robert Williams for his eagerness to commit the Triple Alliance to a strike policy for political ends, moved a vote of censure on the- executive of the Federation for allowing the resolution on conscription, &amp;c, to be tabled at Southport without any notice being given to the affiliated unions. Mr. Wilson&apos;s proposal was defeated, but the Conference passed a resolution proposed by Mr. Ben Tillett, instructing the executive, when in confer-ence with the Triple Alliance, to refrain from committing the affiliated unions to strike action without a ballot vote of the unions concerned. Resolutions were also carried instructing the executive to take immediate steps, in conjunction with other organisations, to secure the complete conversion of increases obtained during the war into actual wage rates, and endorsing the policy of co-operation with the miners and the railwaymen to obtain improved working conditions. A resolution was also passed condemning the secret Army circular.The discussion on the whole is significant as showing that the leaders of the Triple Alliance could not count on such a backing in their pursuit of political aims as they could in the case of industrial objects. It is true, of course, that from the point of view of organisa-tion Transport is the weakest&apos; arm of the Alliance; but such&apos; a result might have been, anticipated in any case. On purely industrial issues, all the men concerned have as a rule an equal interest, because they are all in the sahie position regarding them. But on many political issues, there is little or no more reason why two members of organisations under the Triple Alliance should think alike than any other two members of the community.Shipbuilding.&apos;At a meeting of the National Joint Committee of employers and workpeople held in Manchester on 6th June, a National Agreement was drafted for the avoidance of disputes; this will cover all federated firms in the shipbuilding and ship-repairing industries, and also all workers, skilled and unskilled. The recommendations are to be submitted to the executives of the various unions concerned.Textile Workers.The dispute with regard to hours and wages in the Lancashire Cotton industry is still unsettled. The Ministry of Labour has invited the employers&apos; and operatives&apos; repre-sentatives to a conference, on the 18th June, on the question at issue.The annual conference of the Beamers, Twisters and Drawers Amalgamation on 9th June passed a resolution in favour of the nationalisation of the Cotton industry, and called for an enquiry into the industry similar to the Coal Commission.Teachers, Clerks, Insurance Officials. -   .A conference of the Association of Education Committees of England and Wales on the 5th June adopted a resolution approving the formation of a National Joint Advisory Committee with the National Union of Teachers. The formation of a Whitley Council was discussed, but rejected as impracticable.At the annual conference of the National Union of Clerks on 7th and 9th June, it was decided to leave the question of association,with an Industrial Council under the Whitley Scheme to the sections of members directly concerned. This is a decision by an occupa-tional union in favour of industrial demarcation that is of some interest.The Guild of Insurance Officials held its first conference in London on 9th June, and steps were taken to set up a national organisation.Local Government Officers. .The National Association of Local Government Officers on 9th June rejected a resolution for the registration of the association as a trade union.Corporation Workers.The National Union of Corporation Workers on 9th June protested against the action of the Trade Union Congress in refusing recognition to them. . &apos;Ex-Service Men.The National Federation of bischarged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers, at its annual conference on 8th and 9th June, refused to amalgamate with any other ex-service organisation. It was decided to admit conscientious objectors to membership. It was agreed to send five delegates to a conference to be held under the auspices of the Ministry of Labour on the 12th June.
&apos;Conscription, Russia, &amp;c.The agitation against conscription and &quot; militarism &quot; continues, though the attitude of the Transport Workers&apos; Federation at its conference at Swansea (referred to elsewhere in this Report) was much milder than the extremists wished. At the annual conference of the National Union of Clerks on the 7th June, the president spoke strongly against conscription, the Government attitude to Russia, &amp;c. Devonport and Plymouth branches of the Boilermakers&apos; Society have passed a resolution against the continuance of the war in Russia. The London Workers&apos; Committee has convened a &quot; national rank, and file conference &quot; of industrial organisations for the 14th instant, and it is stated that an attempt will be made to promote a general strike to enforce demands with regard to conscription, &amp;c.Income Tax.The Erith branch of the Friendly Society of Ironfounders calls on the National Council to confer with the Shipbuilding and Foundry Federations with a view to taking steps to obtain the raising of the income tax level to  250. A similar demand was made at the third annual conference of the County of Pembroke Labour Party.As a result of the arrest of two miners for non-payment of income tax, all the miners of the Coedely and Tylcha Collieries, Glamorganshire, came out on strike on the 6th inst. The two men were released in the afternoon and work was resumed.M-hour Week.A 44-hour week has been obtained by Swindon Corporation employees, Tees Wharf workers, and (for four months in the year) by the Plymouth branch of the National Federation of Building Trade Operatives.A proposal for the introduction of a 44-hour&apos;week has been approved by a large majority by the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners.Morpeth Corporation employees are on strike for a 44-hour week.Piece-work and Overtime. s -. .The movement against piece-work and overtime continues. A strike against piece-work is in operation in Lincoln, and plumbers in the Clyde area have been advised to stop all overtime as from the 9th instant. The new agreement in the Making-up Clothing trade in London between the London Employers&apos; Association and the trade unions concerned provides for the avoidance of overtime. The Executive Council of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners has issued definite instructions to its members against accepting payment by results.Co-partnership.A scheme for. enabling employees of the Staveley Coal and Iron Co., Chesterfield, to invest in the company on favourable terms was approved by the shareholders on 6th June.Amalgamation and Federation.The Postmen&apos;s Federation and the Postal and Telegraph Clerks Association have both decided by overwhelming majorities in favour of amalgamation.A joint meeting of the Executives of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen and the National Union of Railwaymen resolved on 5th June to set up a joint committee to consider the linking up of the unions for industrial and political action.The Municipal Employees Association passed a resolution on 9th June urging the speedy completion of the amalgamation with the Workers&apos; Union and the National . Amalgamated Union of Labour.Negotiations are stated to be proceeding for the amalgamation of the Stonemasons&apos; Union and the Bricklayers&apos; Union.A resolution in favour of amalgamation has been passed by a joint meeting of the Amalgamated Society of Tailors and Tailoresses and the United Garment Workers&apos; Trade Union.New Unions and Associations.Unions and associations whose formation has been recently reported include the South Wales and Monmouthshire Dispensers&apos; Association, Newspaper Printing and Publishing Clerks Guild (under the auspices of the National Union of Clerks), and Clergymen&apos;s
Association (to secure a living wage for clergymen and such a redistribution of endowments, as may be necessary for this purpose). Bookstall managers and assistants have decided to form a new union in preference to joining the Paper Workers&apos; Union.Joint Industrial Councils.Boot and Shoe Manufacture. The first meeting of the Council was held on the 27th May. The question of raw material for the trade was raised, and the Director of Raw Materials at the War Office is to be approached with regard to the delay in distributing to manufacturers the American leather purchased by the War Department.Building. The Northern Sub-Committee of the Committee on Scientific Management and Reduction of Costs met at Edinburgh on 28th and 29th May, and more fully discussed the following proposals. (1) The regularisation of employment by means of National,. Regional and Local Joint Committees, with a view to spreading public and the work over season to season, and also by &quot; dove-tailing.&quot; (2) The provision for maintenance during unemployment by means of weekly pay on an ascertained percentage on the Wages Bill, .to be held in trust by a National Joint Committee and administered by the trade unions.Furniture National Conciliation Board. The recent award by the Board fixing the standard rate of women polishers in the London District at Is. per hour has been approved by the Minister under the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act. This award is of great interest to women workers because it implies official recognition for the first time by the trade unions of the introduction of female labour into the French Polishing trade in London.Packing Case Making. The Bristol employers have refused to carry out the CounciPs agreement for the establishment of a 47-hour week without reduction of wages. The local, trade union is threatening a strike, and has asked the Council to take the matter up with the Ministry of Labour in order to compel the employers to accept the decision of the Council.Trade Boards.Tobacco Trade. A conference has been held between the representatives of the Imperial Tobacco Company and certain trade unions, and a scale of wages agreed to between the parties in excess of the minimum rates proposed by the Tobacco Trade Board. The conference also had under consideration the institution of a normal week of 44 hours,, but the consideration of this matter has been deferred.Laundry Trade Board. The Board held their first meeting on the 29th May, and it was continued on the 30th May. Certain proposals as to the fixing of minimum rates, of wages which were made will be considered further on the 20th June, 1919.Sugar, Confectionery, and Food Preserving Trade Board (Great Britain). The Minister has made an Order, dated the 6th June, confirming overtime rates fixed by the Board. The overtime rates fixed are time and a quarter for the first two hours, time and. a half! thereafter, and double time on Sundays and holidays.(2) District Reports.London and South-Eastern.Unemployment.-Hh.eve is a general decrease in the number of civilians unemployed, in this area, but the continued unemployment of ex-Service men is a matter of some concern. Outside London unemployment is naturally most acute in the towns on the Lower Thames (Chatham, Dartford, Erith, Gravesend), and in such isolated areas as Hastings, Brighton and Newhaven. Road-making and housing schemes are still retarded by lack of material and transport. London has somewhat peculiar problems in the resettlement of fairly highly-educated young men who would naturally have entered the banking, insurance and legal professions, and of such superior workers as are unable to enter industry as skilled tradesmen, but who are not eligible for the benefits of the interrupted apprenticeship scheme. The training of disabled men is, here as elsewhere, an urgent question.General.-Industrial agitation is in a state of suspended animation until the Whitsun holidays are over. The woodworkers&apos; unions have called out all their members working on piece-work systems in the engineering and allied trades. This development in the premium bonus controversy is resented by some of the workers affected, particularly at Ipswich.
South Midlands and Eastern.Unemployment. There is a temporary increase of unemployment at Ipswich and King&apos;s Lynn ; otherwise, the decrease is general over the area. There is no indication of a revival of unemployment on a large scale.South-Western.Unemployment. Unemployment is marked in three industrial areas: the Severn towns (Bristol, Cheltenham.and Gloucester), the Hampshire basin (Southampton, Ports-mouth and Cowes), and the isolated industrial area of Plymouth and Devonport. At Bristol unemployment among engineers is decreasing; a temporary increase is reported from Gloucester. Large schemes of road-making and harbour construction are being arranged at Plymouth. Swindon complains of a shortage of material, and there is a brisk demand for clothing operatives at Stroud.General. The unemployment of discharged soldiers is attracting attention in Bristol, and there is a movement to cease overtime work so as to absorb them.  A Joint Industrial-Council for the Mercantile Marine of the Bristol Channel ports is being discussed. Generally speaking, there is little movement of industrial opinion in the area.West Midlands.Unemployment. Unemployment still continues to present a problem of some acute-ness in Greater Birmingham, Coventry, Dudley, Smethwick and Cradley Heath, especially in the last-named town, where chain-makers have been recently thrown out of work by a shortage of iron bars. In Birmingham, an attempt is being made to furnish, suitable training in tailoring for discharged and demobilised ex-Service men. Otherwise, matters are settling down to pre-war conditions, and actual or pending disputes can be regarded as individual outbursts.Yorkshire and East Midlands.Unemployment. Decreased numbers on the male register of unemployed for the week ending the 30th May were announced from 41 exchanges, but there are small temporary increases of unemployed labour of the general workers type at Dewsbury and Lincoln. The manufacture of textiles and metal canisters and glass is proposed to relieve unemploy-ment in Sheffield and Barnsley. There is little change in such centres as Bradford, Derby, Hull and the lace towns.General. Sectional strikes have occurred among engineers in the area, which the trade union officials have been unable to control; but the West Riding Corporations, which were faced with threatened strikes of their employees, are endeavouring with some success to avert an open break. In Lincoln, the piece-work strike still continues. The &quot; Notting-ham Guardian &quot; has published an open letter from Mr. C. Wardle, General Secretary of the Amalgamated Society of Operative Lace Makers, protesting against the sale of lace machinery in operation at fancy prices to the French manufacturers as encouraging unemployment and profiteering.North Western.Unemployment. For the first time all the local Employment Committee areas in this division report a decrease of unemployment; this is most marked in the cotton centres. Local reports indicate that in Warrington the wire-drawing industry is busy, but appre-hensive of American competition. The soap works at Warrington and Widnes complain of the rapid rise in price of West African raw material since Government control has been removed. The chemical industry at Widnes is quiet, but in the same town copper smelting is absorbing labour. Shipbuilding at Birkenhead is active, but expansion is hindered by the absence of sufficient housing accommodation for the workers.General. A crisis in the cotton trade seems more and more inevitable unless some third party intervenes before the 21st June. At Liverpool, congestion at the docks continues, as the dockers refuse to work overtime. Feeling is running high on the Mersey against the employment of coloured labour on ships. Demarcation disputes among the Liverpool unions still continue.Northern.Unemployment. While the number of unemployed in such centres as Newcastle, Gateshead, Sunderland and Middlesbrough is decreasing, there is an unwrelcome rise in the -figures for unemployed male workers in Blyth, Carlisle, Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, and
Sunderland. The iron and steel works in the area complain of labour difficulties and lack of transport due to the shortage of wagon wrights and wagon builders and to the congestion on the railways caused by the high freight charges for sea transport.General. The ballot of the metal trades on the question of the 44-hour week as against a 47-hour week shows an overwhelming majority in favour of shorter hours. The brick-layers and bricklayers&apos; labourers in the steel and iron works have abandoned their agitation to enforce the shorter week by refusing to work overtime and during week-ends, but the skilled mechanics threaten to stop work on the 18th June unless some concession on the matter is granted. The lack of houses in Newcastle has been the subject of a labour demonstration which complained of the inflated prices of raw materials, and demanded public control over rents. Over three thousand new houses are required for Newcastle alone.  A dispute over the times of unloading has laid up most of the Tyne trawlers.Wales.Unemploymenl.-GeB.Qml factors retarding the absorption of unemployed men in Wales are various sectional strikes, the shortage of raw material, of rolling stock and of houses, and the uncertainty of future markets and prices, especially in the building trades.. The settlement of strikes has brought down the unemployment figures for Cardiff and Carmarthen. In Pembroke the unemployed from His Majesty&apos;s Dockyard present a peculiar local problem.General.- The industrial situation is comparatively quiet, but the recent rise in the cost of living is adding to the undercurrent of unrest. In a dispute in the Bristol Channel ports over the wages of riggers, boatmen and dock pilots, the Transport Workers&apos; Federa-tion are taking up a very firm attitude and threatening drastic action. The shortage of coal is viewed with apprehension by the Siemen&apos;s Steel Association and the Swansea Metal Exchange in the face of American competition ; the increase of  8 a ton on the price of sheet bars since 1914 is regarded as largely due to the factor of fuel. There is a tendency in the coalfield to develop the &quot; in-strike &quot; with some ingenuity and pertinacity ; local opinion assigns the responsibility to the propaganda of the Plebs League.Scotland.Unemployment.-Whi\e there is a general absence of reference to widespread unemployment, the figures indicate a sufficiently Serious condition of affairs in Inverness,. Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Dumbarton, Glasgow, Paisley, Lanarkshire and Kilmarnock.In the South, the Dumfries Employment Committee is urging that workshops at Gretna be used to train disabled soldiers. In Dumbarton and Clydebank proposed extensions of Messrs. Singer&apos;s workshops and the introduction of rope works in the Vale of Leven should ease the situation. Public works on a large scale are contemplated in industrial Fife, which, include new waterworks for Cowdenheath and a new port for Dunfermline at the Inverkeithing basin. In the Highlands, the problems of water-power, local industries, afforestation and small holdings are still being discussed.General. The wave of unrest has not yet reached the Clyde ; even the refusal of the Secretary for Scotland to reconsider the sentences on the Glasgow strikers has created no excitement. But unemployment and bad housing provide subjects of serious if somewhat inarticulate discontent. Tn Lanarkshire, the A.S.E. Committee is interesting itself in the expulsion of dilutees, and seems to be acting on the assumption that men who have joined the Society since 1914 are necessarily skilled. Generally speaking, the restoration of pre-war conditions in Scotland has been effected so far very quietly.Part V. Disputes.(a) Involving a Stoppage of Work.Miners. \,Black Country-The strike in the Earl of Dudley&apos;s Collieries has been settled as a result of conferences initiated by the Mayor of Dudley. The terms of settlement have not yet been published.South Wales.-The strike at Bedwas on the question of the workmen&apos;s safety shows signs of settlement. The Executive of the S.W.M.F. has accepted a Home Office suggestion that a deputation of workmen should visit and inspect collieries in Yorkshire where the new conveyors
are being worked, and it is stated that steps are being taken for the resumption of work. Bargoed miners have agreed to resume work on condition that the practice of knocking out timber on conveyor faces is discontinued pending negotiations. On the 7th June brief strikes took place in two Glamorganshire collieries owing to the arrest of two miners for non-payment of income tax. The men were released and work was resumed the same day. At Clydach Vale work has been resumed unconditionally; at Pwllbach the dispute has been settled by the with-drawal of two outside hewers to whose employment the men had taken exception; and at Blaengarw, the strikers have returned to work pending negotiation.Nottingham. The dispute which began at Mansfield last month, owing to a difficulty of demarcation between miners and enginemen and firemen, has been settled by a compromise.Yorkshire. An unofficial strike of some 1,200 workers, caused by a dispute about overtime for surface workers, is in progress at Pontefract. The Yorkshire Miners&apos; Association refuses to intervene or to grant strike pay.Scotland. The dispute at Polton Colliery, Midlothian, continues. Clothing Trade.West End Tailors. The strike has been settled by the acceptance by both parties of a recommendation from the Ministry of Labour for the resumption of work pending a conference. Work was resumed on the 10th June, and a conference was held at the Ministry of Labour on the 11th.  The employees complain that 40 tailors have not been reinstated.Birmingham. A strike affecting 100 tailors, mostly women, is in progress in Birmingham. They are all employees of middle-men, and they complain that an agreement arrived at last Easter is not being carried out.Building Trade.The strikes of builders at Totnes and Boston have been settled on terms favourable to the workmen. Those at Carnarvon and in Ireland continue. At Lincoln it was decided on the 11th June to resume the strike which had been suspended pending a re-hearing of the Court of Arbitration. The Court reaffirmed its decision not to ratify the local wages agreement between employers and operatives.Over 7,000 plumbers at Liverpool struck work on the&apos; 7th demanding an increase of Qd. an hour.

HadfiekTs (Sheffield) the men on strike agreed to return to work on the 11th June on the understanding that the wage agreement in dispute should be carried out in the main. The strikes of 1,500 fitters at Wakefield con-tinues. At Middlesbrough, 1,000 bricklayers, engineers, electricians, &amp;c, in the employ of Messrs.

(&amp;) Not Involving a Stoppage of Work.Miners.Two thousand miners in the Durham area threaten to strike unless a dispute at the Bolden Colliery is settled. Trouble is also threatened among the NottingJiamshire and Derbyshire enginemen and firemen (who have been induced to continue work, pending a conference, although their notices expired on the 10th May), and the miners of Lanarkshire, Ayrshire, and the Lothians, who complain that the owners have failed to carry out an agreement suggested by the Coal Controller and accepted by the men.

The Minister of Labour &apos; has suggested a joint conference for the 18th June.Boot and Shoe Operatives.The National Union of Shoe Makers continues to resist the demand of the Amalgamated Society of Boot and Shoe Operatives for a 30 per cent, advance.
