THE TKANSggggHOE Off THE MINISTRY OP MUNITIONS HOUSING 30HMES TO THE OPHOg Of &apos; WORKS.Memorandum by&apos; the First Commissioner of Works.To the Chancellor of the B:-chequer.The question has arisen of the transference of the housing Schemes of the Ministry of Munitions to my Department,     These housing schemes are of various types and in various phases of development.   The appended statement contains the details.   The Stage3 of completion of these buildings will be seen from the statement, and that whilst some of the schemes are practically finished, others are scarcely commenced.   There are also a large number of temporary bungalow buildings, mostly at Woolwich, which require separate consideration.As a general principle, I think it is undesirable that any Government Department should own and manage housing property of this character.   The experience which has been obtained of the management of the Well Hall Estate at woolwioh, tho buildings of whioh were put up during the war, confirms me in this opinion, if anything like an economic rent is aimed at.     Government Departments Obviously are more subjeot to House of Commons and outside political pressure than private owners.     The difficulty is further enhanced if the Government own small numbers of scattered properties in various towns, the reason for the erection of which has disappeared   with the cessation of the war.     Such property should be taken over by the Local Authorities, or by the firms for whose benefit they were originally built.     It appears that this is the policy which the Ministry of Munitions has been following in most of the schemes submitted, with few exceptions, but, unfortunately, the number of agreements seem to allow of an interregnum for a considerable period after the war, during which the Government remains responsible for&apos;the management of these properties.   I would recommend that every possible affort should be made to cause such agreements to be carried out as speedily as possible, even at some substantial monetary sacrifice.   In the long run, I think, it would prove more economical.   In such cases where any agreement has been come to, arrangements could be made with the Local Authorities, or with the firms mentioned.If this proves impossible, the question of forming Public     t Utility Societies with government assistance should, I think, be considered.The question then arises as to which Department should deal with this matter.   As regards the mere construction and com-oletion of the buildings, the Office of Works is certainly the most suitable Department^and quite prepared to carry out this work. As regards the negotiations for the disposal of these houses, it would appear to me this is more the function of the Local Sovern-ment Board, who can negotiate   with Local Authorities and Public Utility Societies, and&quot;has tho power of financing the work.     The other cases where it is proposed to dispose of the building, the Disposal Board of the ministry of Supply could deal with the houses.     It seems to me that it would be just as easy to sell
some of this houso property, oa it is to sell other things now under the control of tho Disposal Board.A more difficult question is the one relating to the temporary buildings which are known to be of a very unsotis-factory character, -:n&amp; have already caused a considerable amount of trouble.    as far as these temporary houses at V/oolwich are concerned, or others connected with Government Factories, it appsaru to me that the beat method would be for the firms who control the Factories to control these houses. There is an interrelation between factories and housing for workmen working thero, both as regards rent and wages:; which makes it difficult for another party to intervene.   This has apparently been recognised at ysrnborough, where the Office of Works is erecting housing for tho Royal Air    a to ry, by the latter undertaking the management of the property when completed.I would like to draw attention to the arrangements made in the case of the Hoe Green Housing scheme, as snotrer example of a firm managing the buildings on completion. Particulars of this scheme are attached.My proposals, therefore, are as follows:-(1)   That the Office of &quot;.7orks ta&apos;;:e over and complete all outstanding housing schemes, it being open to further consideration as to whether those houses- which are only in an early sta&amp;e of development should be proceeded with, either by Government, or by Local Authorities, or abandoned entirely.(2)   That negotiations /or the disposal of houses immediately should be dealt with by the Local Government Board, or the sale of the houses effected^by the Disposals Board.(3)   That a conference be ooiled between theTreasury, Ministry of Munitions, Local GovernmentBoard and the Office of Works to discuss and dooide the question.(Initialled)    A*H.H.M-OF.PICE 01 WMS.5th June. 1919.
