General Officer Commanding, Wazforce, must decide regarding terms to Mahsuds.   1&apos;ersonally, I am opposed to making terms.   Addressed to Crosthwaite, Tank, repeated Wazforce and Chief Political Officer, Dera Ismail Khan.&apos;   Barton telegraphs from Dera Ismail Khan that General Officer Commanding considers that Jandola can easily hold out till 13th, and hopes to relieve it in a few days.   Also that measures taken in Draban and Kulachi area have appreciably relieved  situation.    Draban attacked nightly by Sherannis, but all attacks successfully driven oil&apos;.    Bannu and Bazara report situation normal.   No news from Toclii.   Kurram reports situation greatly improved ; our villagers protect road against Massozai.   Thai Parachinar. road open, but wire and wireless interrupted.   Minor punitive operations being undertaken against Biland Khel and Khoidad Khel Zaimukt villages, for siding with enemy.   Constant rumours of movement amongst Orakzai discredited by Donald and myself.   Afridis quiet; many Afridis are going to Kahi to watch events, and to loot Kahi if Afghans withdraw.   Our reports show that (inhabitants) of Mingrahar are not enthusiastic about helping iVfghans.   Mir Mukhtar of Batikot and Dehgan Malins of Barn, intimate willingness to provide supplies when our forces advance to Jalalabad. Chaknawar Mullah is trying to force people of Lalpura to break off relations with us and abandon Lalpura; hitherto they have refused to obey him, and are preparing to defend Lalpura against his lashkar.   Last night raiding party carried away nine bullock Chahar drivers and 21 bullocks from Khyber road  near Lalabeg. Khyber Zakka Khel villagers pursued and recovered  10 bullocks and five men. Chitral,  Reilly telegraphs from Mirkani 4th June, 17 hours: &apos; Movable column arrived  Mirkani.   Scouts  and bodyguard also arrive Mirkani-Paitasun  line, as reports   indicated four regiments  of regular with fifth in   reserve marching from Asmar with unknown number of tribesmen to attack us.   Report to-day that tribesmen from Dir, Jandol, kharre and Barsul are joining these Asmar troops, who have occupied Birkot aud Arendu, and are also penetrating to punish the Bashgalis for aiding us looting.   Bashgalis have begun flight into Chitral.   It is reported that Dir tribesmen also contemplate attack by passing into Shishi Valley.   I do not think this would be attack on large scale.&apos;   Peshawar district quiet except for nightly dacoities by deserters, outlaws, and local bad characters.  Most of victims are Hindu money lenders and traders, and these dacoities have shattered brief unity of Hindus and Mussulmans.   Nawab of Amb writes expressing gratitude for gift of rifles, and giving assurance of unswerving loyalty and determination to fight.    All quiet Malakand Agency, Black Mountain.&quot;   Baluchistan reports 5th June,   that news has been received that on 23rd May two Pathan Mullahs took letters from Amir to Luni and Marri Chiefs.   Baluchistan is apprehensive of effect of situation in Zhob, particularly if Muss Khel is attackedsby Shirannis and other Zhob tribes, and fall of Pathan and Baluch tribes generally.   Dispositions are being made to meet the situation which it is hoped will prevent widespread conflagration.
