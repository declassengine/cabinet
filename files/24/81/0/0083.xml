oammm -as m, pohts    on m ummMemorandum by the president of the Board of Trade. -CONGESTION 01 EilLTiil GOODS MFFICI should like to bring to tie notice of my colleagues the present position of the railway3 as regards goods traffic and the rate3 charged for its carriage, where is at the present time a considerable congestion of traffic in some of&quot; the ports.    There is no actual congestion on the railways themselves, though this is owing to the railway policy of not accepting traffic for carriage unless there are facilities for dealing with it at the other end.     The policy is a correct one from the point of view of railway management but the trader who cannot get his traffic accepted is naturally of opinion that there is congestion on the railways.There are difficulties at the terminal stations, probably due to the effect of the 8 hour day  and the consequent reduction in the capacity of the terminal facilities, but largely also due to&apos;the shortage of cartage to meet demands, and it is a fact that Railway Companies under present conditions are called upon to provide cartage for a greater amount of traffic than in pre-war days.   The reason for this is that the co3t of cartage when performed by the trader has very much increased and the railway rates, which in many instances include collection and delivery, have not been raised.     The conseouence is that it pays the trader much batter to have his traffic delivered by the Railway Companies and whereas in the past he got a rebate from the collected and delivered rate if he himself prforma-d the cartage, there is not a sufficient sum included in.the rate to enable the Companies to give a rebate which would pay tlie trader for the&apos;cost of cartage.Congestion at the ports is again to a considerable degree due to the fact that railway rates have not been raised.    A large -amount of traffic which hitherto wa3 distributed by the coastwise steaimrs now comes to the railways, the railway rates being much less than the      $ freights on the coastwise steamers..     Examples of sach traffic are China Clay from Fowey to Staffordshire, which formerly&apos; went by soa to the Mersey and thence by canal, Tinplates from Swansea for shipment at Liverpool, wool brought into London of riiich a large proportion was formerly seni; coastwise to the Humber and distributed thence by canal or rail and which is now sent by rail from London, coal from Durham to the South, and there are many others.it/
It would be of great advantage to the ports and the trade of the country generally if the steamers which formeil/ carried traffic coastwise could be brought back into trade, but with railway rates as they are there is little chance of this.  It had been supposed that when the Ministry of Ways and Communications Bill becomes law this question of rates would be dealt with, but there seems no immediate prospect of any effective step being possible under the&quot;Bill for some time to coma, and in the meantime the railway problem is urgent and the position will be a very serious one unless some-thing&apos; can now be done.  Distribution by canal is also hampered by the existing railway rates which are lower tv.an the cost of canal carriage.&amp; cure for the difficulties of Coastwise Shipping, Cartage, and Canal Carriage would be a power to mare a substantial increase in the present railway rates for the carriage of goods and mineral traffic, without regard to the present statutory maxima.There would seem to be four different courses1.  To force the fays and Communications Bill through befpre the Recess.2.  To pass before the Recess a special Measure giving the necessary powers.3.  To make a Regulation under the Defence of the Realm Act.4.  To let matters take their course.Of these, the fourth hardly appears to be worth the Realm Act. presents special difficulties as, in the first place it may be doubted whether a&quot;Regulation could be intra vires and, in the second place, it would not get over the difficulties created by the Railway end Canal Traffic Act, 1894.  It would be possible for a trader to lodge a complaint with the Railway and Canal Commission against the increased rate, and to continue to pay the Railway Company on the old rate until a decision was given by the Court.The introduction of special legislation to giva power to make the increase, which might possibly take the form of setting up the Ministry of Ways and Communications, but limiting its powers to Railways, Light Railways, and Canals, would be welcomed by the opposition to the Ministry of Ways and Communications Bill, but would have a very weakening effect upon that Measure.
For these reasons, the first course would appear the most desirable, but the Government should not he left in the position at the Recess that the Ways and Coinmunications Bill has not become law, and that there is no time to obtain special powers to deal with the emergenoy.   It might therefore, if it is not possible to obtain the Ways and Communications Bill before the. Recess, &quot;be necessary to pass a short emergency measure giving power to the Boar a of Trade to direct an all-round, percentage increase in railway rates.It has been suggested as an alternative or supplementary measure that power should be taken by a Defence of the Realm Regulation to enable the Railway Companies to refuse to accept traffic which was previously carried either coastwise or by canal.   The working of such a scheme would be difficult and raise more difficulties for the trader than even a large increase of rates as he would not know whether his traffic would be carried by rail or be diverted to the sea or canal and in the latter case he might, as matters stand at present, have to pay a higher rate for carriage than he would with an increase of even as much as 50$ in. the present railway rates.
MEM SfflLThe wagon stock in Gfreat Britain is divided into two blocks, namely, privately owned and railway owned.As regards privately owned wagons, the total stock in 1914 was about 700,000, and though exact figures are not available as to the stock to-day, it may be asaimed that the usual wastage has continued during the years of war; that a diminished construction of wagons in replacement has taken place; and that no additions have been possible during the same period.  Also the policy of the Government, as announced in connection&quot; with the Ministry of Ways and Communications Bill has had the effect ox discouraging owners of private wagons from atteonts to make up wastage.., and the stock of -orivately owned wagons at the present day is probably as&quot;much as 50,000 to 60,000 less than it was before the war.As regards railway owned wagons, the stock prior to the war was about 740,000 and&apos; in addition to the wagons which were sent to Ifcance, no additions to stock apart from replacements have been possible chiringiho war, no  has it been possible to repair and raijahtain the stock as under peace conditions.It is estimated that die stock of railway owned wagons is about 75.000 below what it nould have been under normal conditions, and this number is accounted for as follows:-Wagons sent to the Armies in France and not yet returned.......................25,000The normal rate of increase before the war was 7.000 wagons per year and as no additions have Been possible during the war the deficiency under this heading is, say....30,000taiber of wagons immobilised for repairin excess of me number normallyawaiting repair.........................20,000^T^OOCT&quot;mini mm   i  * i u &quot;* &apos;.....-The Railway Companies are talcing steps actively to make up their deficiencies in railway wagons, but this process1 is at the. pr&amp;sant time considerably handicapped by shortage,of&quot;skilled men, and.to a certain extent, by tm difficulties in obtainingsuitable timber.
4 d oThis is not, however, the pesHion as regards private ly owned wagons, because, as I have said, the announce-meat by the Government of its intention to prohibit in future the system by which railway wagons can be private-ly owned, has discouraged owners of private wagons from taking action in the direction of making up wastage.It is important that steps should be taken to nain-tain this block of stock and to make additions to meet the normal growth in trade, and on the whole, I think it is clear that the position is sufficiently serious to warrant direct action by the Government which has for its object the increase of the wagons available for carrying the traffic on British railways.There are about 11,500 wagons which were construe-ted or arc still due for delivery for service with the Armies in Prance, or for Government service in this country, and which have been declared surplus by the Government Departments concerned.All these wagons should be placed at the disposal of the Railway Companies as quickly as possible, and as there are financial difficulties regarding the purchase of them by the Railway Companies, I suggest that, pend-ing the establishment of the Ministry of Ways and Con-munications, the wagons in question should rormfra Govero-ment Pool, and should be hired to the Railway Companies upon terms to be approved by the Treasury, and steps should be taken ii investijmtion proved them necessaryHux supplement production by placing orders at ftoolwich or other national factories.There is undoubtedly a shortage of locomotive power on the Railways as a whole, for sinilar reasons to those outlined in the case, of wagons, and it is not, I think, necessary to re-state these reasons.Delivery overseas was stopped in aarch 1919 of 216 locomotives which remain to be delivered under a Govern- -raent contract for 2-8-0 type of locomotives for service in Prance.   On the formation of the Disposal Board, these 216 engines were handed over to that Board for disposal and were offered to the Railway Companies, but the result was disappointing, as only 60 locomotives have been taken up by them.The reasons given by the Railwav Companies for not acquiring these locomotives are based on price and type. As regards the latter, it is true that certain Companies could not utilise these large locomotives on account of load and structure gauge limitations, but in view of the general shortage, arrangements should, I consider, be made for Companies which can use these large loco-motives, to take them, and hand over to other Railway Companies lighter types of locomotives.The
9 h4 lk5ht alternative is to dispose of the locomotires abroad, a transaction which is -unthinkable in the existing circumstances.I therefore submit that I may be authorisedfl) If it is considered impracticable to pass the Ministry of Ways and Communications Bill through its remaining stages through both Houses before tho Recess, to introduce a measure as emergency legislation to enable the Board of frade to direct an allround percentage increase in railway rates.(2)      arrange in consultation with the Disposal Board for the formation of a Government pool of the 11,500 wagons constructed for and de-clared surplus by the War Office, Ministry of Munitions and other Departments; and to allo-cata these wagons to the Railway Companies on hire terms to be approved by the Treasury.(3) $0 deal similarly with the 216 locomotives of the 2-8-0 type due for delivery under a Govern-ment contract.ID To prepare in conduction with the Ministry of Supply a scheme for supplementing the Govern-ment Pool of wagons by placing orders with such private firms as are available, and by arrang-ing for the construction of wagons at Woolwioh or othor national factories which could be adapted for the purpose and whioh it is in the National interest to Keep in operation.!Thare is a further point r/hich I would like conoid-ered. When the Railway feecutive Committee was first set up the  resident of the Board of Trade was made Chairman, with the idea that if there arose a confliot between Naval, Military or Civil needs which the Committee them-selveft could not satisfactorily deal with., the President of the Board of Trade could be called in as Chairman and if he could not settle the matter ha would refer it to the Cabinet.   Fortunately there was no need for the Pree-idexit of the Board of Trade to act in this capacity, and although the Board of Trade hare dealt with tha lailway Bareoutire Committee in many matters, mainly relating to financial control, the Hallway Executive Committe hare largely managed their business for themselves.   I am, however, responsible to Parliament for the action of- th* Committee and I am inclined to think that the time haa come when there should be a closer connection between the Board of Trade and the Railway Executive Committee. That Committee, though it has done tho most excellent work and continues to do so, is naturally nyt in a good.position-
itposition to advise on future polioy in view of the un-oortainty of the position -of the railways,   I should feel myself in a soundor position with regard to the future if there was someone on the Committee acting as my representative and having as such a leading voice on policy.   General Sir Philip Hash would, I think, &quot;be admirably qualified to act as my representative, and as he is well-known to the General Managers his appoint ment would be calculated to raise the minimum amount of friction with the present members thereof.A.
