i p, iDECONTROL   OP   THE   FLOUR   MILLS   . &apos;:t U &quot;)$7* THE BREAD SUBSIDYMEMORANDUM   BY   THE   POOD   CONTROLLERI desire to submit for the consideration of the War Cabinet two memoranda from the Royal Commission on Wheat Supplies ifi the first of which it is urged that the present system of cental of the Flour Mills should be terminated as from 31st December-, 1919.I am of opinion that the course proposed is desirable, as it will not only lead to a reduction of staff, but is also calculated to benefit the consumer by freeing the Milling industry from what is in effect an uneconomic system of guaranteed profits.The Wheat Commission will continue to sell imported wheat at a price which is calculated to ensure the production of the 9d. loaf and may in practice bring the price of bread below this figure.I am advised that the most convenient time for the terminate ion of control is the end of the present year and as the millers are entitled to six months notice in accordance with their agree-ments, it is important that a decision should be arrived at with-   * out delay, so that the necessary intimation may be issued not later than the 30th June.This course can be followed however only on the assumption that no restrictions are placed on the purohase of flour and that the present list of Precluded Purposes, e.g. wholesale biscuit making, industrial uses etc, is withdrawn.I understand that the Licence Duty on flour used for Precluded Purposes entails serious hardships on certain manufact-manufacturers, while lt&apos;s collection is difficult, and in the absence of an Act of Parliament, duty unpaid cannot be recovered.   It would be clearly inadvisable to restrict the use of subsidised flour to the making of loaf bread as this would necessitate the issue of flour permits to registered home-bakers, with the establishment of a par-oial system of bread rationing and an increase in the general retail price of flour used in private households.I accordingly recommend (l) that the proposal in the second memorandum for the withdrawal of the Precluded Purposes Clause of the Flour and Bread (Prices)   Order 1917 be accepted and (2) . that the scheme for tho decontrol of the flour mills, outlined in the first memorandum, be adoptedeMinistry of Pood, 17th June 1919.GEO. H. ROBERTS.
DE-CONTROL   OP   THE   FLOUR   MILLS.1*      In accordance with the instructions of the Food Council the Royal Commission on Wheat Supplies have examined the scheme put forward by the Bread Subsidy Committee for the modification of the system under which the milling industry is controlled.The proposal of the Bread Subsidy Committee was:-(a) that the present control of the milling industry should be removed and the Flour and Bread (Prices) Order withdrawn,   and(b) that the Royal Commission on Wheat Supplies should sell imported wheat to the Millers on a scale of prices governed by the relative intrinsic values of the various grades of wheat to the average Miller; the scale to bo fixed so as to ensure the production of a 9d. loaf under   normal conditions of milling and baking.2,      The Royal Commission are of opinion that this proposal should be adopted and the Flour Mills de-controlled at the end of the present calendar year and the Flour and Bread (Prices) Order be revoked at the same time.      In support of this course the Royal Commission would urge the following considerations(a) The abolition of the present system of Flour Mill control would enable the Commission to dispense with the services of the staff of one of their administrative branches, the Flour Mills Control Committee,(b) The present system with a guaranteed pre-war profit to Millers, without regard to the actual output of the mills, offers no incentive to efficient management and economical working and presents no opportunity for improvements in quality or reduction in price; and although control was essential to the conservation of wheat supplies during the war, it is open to grave objection at a time when certain of the forces of trade competition might be released with advantage to the consumer.(c) The Royal Commission anticipate that they will be in a position to meet the demands of millersho increase their output as the result of a reduction in prices.(d) The withdrawal of tho Flour &amp; Bread (Prices) Order will encourage bakers to take advantage of the opportunity of competitive buying of flour and of improved methods of production, with a view to developing their business by means of a reduction in the price of the loaf.
4G9(e)   The decontrol of the flour mills will thus tend to produce a cheaper loaf, or alternatively will enable the Royal Commission to sell wheat at the highest price consonant with the efficient production of the 9d. loaf.3. With regard to the position arising from the decontrolof the flour mills, the Royal Commission desire to offer the following explanations:-(a)     It is estimated that in order to produce the 9d., loaf, it will be necessary to sell No.l Northern. Manitoba Wheat at approximately 60/* per quarter of 480-lbs. with other qualities at recognised relative prices.   Though it is almost certain that the average cost price of imported wheat next autumn will be lower than the present figure, it will exceed the proposed selling price of 60/- per quarter, and would, therefore, involve the maintenance of a bread Subsidy(b) British Wheat will be sold to the millers at a price on a parity with the prices fixed for imported wheat by the Royal Commission, hut this will raise no fresh administrative problem, as it is understood that the Board of Agriculture are preparing the machinery through which the British farmer will receive any payment required to bring his price up to the guaranteed minimum for home grown wheat.(c) Under the agreements drawn up between the Food Controller and the millers six months notice of decontrol must be given, and if the proposal to decontrol the Flour Mills be accepted, a decision must be taken immediately in order that the notices may be issued before the 50th June. For administrative reasons a date at the end of next December will be the most convenient to the milling industry aad the Royal Commission.(d) If the Flour Mills are to be decontrolled -as from the end of the year, it will be. necessary before any of the 1919 crop of British wheat comes to the market - which may occur as early as the beginning of August - to reduce the selling price of imported wheat to the figure at which, it will bo sold after de-control has taken place.   This must be done so that the &quot;parity price&quot; of British Wheat may be approximately the same for the whole of the 1919 orop.4. The Royal Commission would suggest that if it be decidedto obtain Cabinet authority for the de-control of the flour mills, copies of this report should be sent to the board a of Agriculture.CRAWFORD &amp; BALCARRES. Chairman.Royal Commission on Wheat Supplies. 16th June, 1919.
470MEMORANDUM ON THE BREAD SUBSIDY&quot;The decision of the Government to subsidise bread necessitated an adjustment in the wholesale selling price of flour and the issue of an Order regulating the price of both bread and flour.It is understood that the original intention of the Cabinet was to confine the benefit of the subsidy to flour used by bakers and householders for bread baking, but it was found impracticable at that time to devise a satisfactory system which would   effect this object, and the Cabinet subsequently decided that the subsidy should be ex-tended to all flour used by bakers and confectioners and to all flour sold for domestic consumption.   With a view to placing some limita-tion on the uses to which subsidised flour might be applied, a list of the use a of flour not to be subsidised was prepared but the list was confined to those uses in respect of which it was practicable at that time to enforce the taking out of a Licence, and the payment of a duty approximately equivalent to the difference between the subsidy-dised selling price of flour and its cost to the State.Under the stress of war conditions the collection of the duty was not a difficult matter, because the goodwill was assured both of the public and of the trades affected.   In the altered circumstances brought about by the cessation of hostilities it is considered doubt-ful whether the Ministry will be able to support its action in face of abjections raised by those who claim to be victimised under the extra-ordinary anomalies that arise from the imposition of the duty. These anomalies which have always existed could be ignored so long as war conditions prevailed, but since the armistice real hardship has been experienced, particularly amongst manufacturers of forms of food that are normally used as substitutes for bread.In these circumstances the Royal Commission on Wheat Supplies was of opinion that the situation should be fully reviewed, and in March last the Pood Controller appointed a Departmental Committee under the, Chairmanship of Mr. McCurdy to investigate the incidence and adminis^a-tion of the Bread Subsidy (Minute 456 of the Foog Council).After carefully considering the present system and several possible alternatives this Committee reported (Minute 518 of the Pood Council) thati-1, Although the present system, hastily devised to meet an emergency, had on the whole worked admirably as   a war measure, it is now open to serious objection, the main points being (a) that out of the total subsidy estimated at  50,000,000 per annum some  14,500,000 is due to the use of subsidised flour for purposes other than the manufacture of bread, (b) that the Licence Duty on Flour for Precludod Purposes entails serious hardships on certain manufacturers, its collection is difficult and in the absence of an Act of Parliament duty unpaid cannot be recovered,2, That the present system could be improved by the abolition of the Licence Duty except In the case of Export, Ships&apos; Stores and Industrial Uses.That as an alternative to the present system it is now administratively practicable to confine the subsidy to flour used in the manufacture of loaf bread,Under the Bread Order bakers are compelled to keep records showing the manufacture and sale of loaf bread and on returns based on these   records a rebate of the difference between the cost of flour and the subsidised price could be paid to bakers in respect of flour used for this purpose.     Flour used for rolls, buns and cakes would not be subsidised.3,
471The price of flour sold retail all of which is at present subsidised, could, in order to cover the cost of production to the Government, be raised from 2/8 per stone to the full cost price of 3/10.In order that home bakers might not be penalised it would be necessary to institute a system of registration, with flour permits *   A householder who baked at home, having filled up an application form giving particulars of the family would receive from the Pood Control Committee a permit which she would lodge with a registered retailer of flour authorising the purchase of so much flour per week at the subsidised price.The rebate to bakers on flour used for bread making and the refund to retailers on flour sold   to home bakers would be made by an accounting staff under the control of the Divisional Food Commissioners,The present subsidy is paid on an estimated output of 42,000.000 sacks per annum.   Of this 30,000,000 sacks are used for bread making, 25,000,000 by registered bakers and 5,000,000 by home-bakers.    The subsidy would therefore be reduced by approximately  1,200,000 a month.To make the scheme watertight would involve full registration of the home bakers with notification of deaths, births, demobilisation, immigration and emigration.The Food Council held that the objections to the introduction of the alternative system outweighed any possible advantages and adopted the recommendation of the Committee that the present system I with the continued collection of duty on Export, Shipsf Stores and Industrial Uses, but with the abolition of the Licence Duty in tho home market, be maintained and that Treasury assent be obtained to the proposal.The Treasury having refused their assent Mr. mcCurdy on the 12th June interviewed the Chancellor of the Exchequer who requested I that a memorandum might be laid before the War Cabinet stating that I the question of restricting the Bread Subsidy to loaf bread had been! considered, that the Ministry had not thought it practicable to suggest that course but on the other hand desired that the existing [ Licence Duty should be modified. royal Commission on Wheat Supnlie Trafalgar House,H.F.
