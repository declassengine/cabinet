The use of military personnel for the handling, movement, storage, etc,, of surplus stores and this division of responsibility in regard thereto between the Ministry of Munitions and the T,&apos;ar Office.Memorandum by, the Secretary of State for War.1.     Immediately after the Armistice it waa recognised that whatever arrangements were made for the dispooal of surplus stores, some provision must be made for the storage, handling and movement and guarding the stores prior to disposal.     As soon as the responsibility of dealing with all surplus stores was allocated to the Ministry of Munitions, the entire control of all matters in regard to these passed to the Ministry of Munitions.     As however the Ministry had at the time no personnel either in the United Kingdom or abroad to take over the storage, guarding, handling and movement of the surplus stores, and, in the early days of demobilization:, the War Office had military personnel available for the purpose, the war Office agreed as a transitional measure to undertake this for the Ministry of Munitions until the latter could make the necessary arrangements or dispose of the stores.     This transitional arrangement was later embodied in Army Order 304 of 1919.2.    While the War Office are anxious to assist the Ministry as far as passible, the time has no1? arrived when these functions can no longer be carried out by military personnel.   Since the Armistice, over 2i million men and one hundred thousand officers have been demobilized, and a point has been reached when the continuance of these functions by the War Office means that Military personnel entitled to be demobilized are being retained for purely civilian duties in regard to surplus stores and the organization of the after war armies is hampered by the diversion of military personnel who are urgently required for the New Armies, to duties in regard to surplus stores-.3.    The matter was represented to the Ministry of Munitions on SOth May in letter Ho. 57/Gen.Uo./9554 (c. 0f S.S.), but as will be seen by their reply No. Secretary/ Disposals/?92 of 22nd May, 1919, the view taken by the Ministry   is that apart from a somewhat qualified and partial offer of consultation in regard to stations and Parks in the United Kingdom, the Army should undertake the   entire burden of these duties in regard to surplus stores indefinitely until the Ministry have disposed of them.The Army Council, cannot accept this vie&quot;.4.    From the point of view both of the organization of the after war Army, and the hastening of demobilization, the Army Council consider it essential that civilian duties such as those in regard to surplus stores should be carried out by civilian personnel.    Ths indefinite liability proposed in the letter of the Ministry to be placed upon the Army is one which        hamper Army re-organization, and at the same time seriously delay demobilization.WAR CABINET,m
5-     From the financial point of view also,  the proposal of the Ministry of Munitions is open to serious objection, Though postponement   of sale may increase the price&apos;realised, if the expenditure on personnel retained for this purpose exceeds the increase in price realised,  the result will be a financial loss a     It is only when the expenditure and the power to hasten disposal are under the same Department and the responsibility on these matters is centralised and clearly defined,., that rival advantages can be effectively balanced.It is only when actual responsibility for expenditure rests with tho Department which has the power to make the decision which governs it, that all the factors can be adequately considered^     Per instance, the longer surplus storesare retained,, especially in foreign stations,  the greater will be the progressive increase in loss by depredation on the part of the local inhabitants.     The Ministry suggest that this should be met by the War Office enrolling a corps of commissionaires and not by hastening the rate of sale and by the aoceptance of a lower price than was first contemplated. The retention of personnel for surplus stores involves not only the normal expenditure such as pay, etc., but also the retention of attendant services such as hospitals, etc-, ana in unhealthy localities such as Macedonia, involves liabilities in regard to casualties and pensions which might in many cases far outweigh, any ordinary reduction in price due to prompt as opposed to prolonged sale.This aspect of the question is illustrated by the telegrams from the G.O.C. Constantinople, copies of which are attached in an Appendix..6.     rhile the Army Council recognise that tho Ministry of Munitions are anxious to give adequate weight to the requests for increasing the rapidity of disposal which they have repeatedly urged, they are of opinion that it would be more satisfactory if the Ministry   were placed in direct relation with all the factors, since they alone possess the deoisive control in regard to them.The Army Council therefore consider that the recommendations contained in their letter of the 20th May should be confirmed and the question is referred to the V/ar Cabinet for decision.(Intd.)

57/Gen..lfo./9564 (C* of S. &amp; S.)20th Kay, 1919.Sir,1 hare the honour to refer to the question of the storage handling and movement of stores surplus to Army requirements in regard to which provisional instructions for the guidance of military officers concerned are contained in Army Council Instruction 204 of 1919 to which reference is made in a letter No, Sec./Diep./792 of tho 25th April, 1919*The Army Council Instruction embodies a provisioft&amp;l arrangement intended only to cover the transition period of demobilization of the Army and the re-organisation of the Ministry, it would appear that the time has now arrived when it is necessary to reach a definite understanding as to the responsibility respectively of the War Office and the Ministry on these questions,.2.    1&apos;Tom the point of vie?/ of completing demobilisation and the organisation of the post helium army, it is of the utmost importance that duties which are not of a military character&apos; should be transferred to civilians as soon as poasiblfe^ It is very   undesirable, even if   it were possible, that men who can claim to be demobilised should be retained in the Army for purely civilian duties.   At the same time, military personnel required for the post be Hum army which is now being organised cannot be spared for duties in regard to storage, handling or movements of stores surplus to Army requirements.3*     $his question also has a direct bearing on diepoaal policy,   $To doubt postponement of disposal may in certain cases, enable a higher sale price to be obtained.   But if the expenditure on storage and personnel, together with the loss through depreciation involved in postponement, exceeds the increase in price realised, this policy would from a broad economic point of view result in an eventual deficit. No doubt the balance of economic advantage in regard to this matter is receiving adequate consideration from the Ministry; but it would appear that the Ministry would be in a better position to estimate the cost of storage;,, etc., if the whole matter were in their hands, viz,, if the necessary l&amp;T&amp;our and staff were composed of civilians in the direct employ of the Ministry and all expenses were paid directly by the Ministry.4.  &quot;While of course every endeavour is made by the Military&apos; Authorities to a-roid depreciation during storage, this is a matter of increasing difficulty, particularly outside the United Kingdom, when in addition to normal vicissitudes such as weather, etc., there is the further risk of pilfering and depredation on the part of the local inhabitants, an element of lose which with the progressive decrease in available military personnel is daily becoming more formidable.5,    The following arrangements are suggested for regulating the transfer of the responsibility for handling movement and storage, etc., of surplus stores fron the War Office to the Kinistry of MunitionsIn

Sir,Your obedient Servant,
Ministry of Munitions of rar, Whitehall Place, London,&apos; S.vr.2 2nd If ay, 1919.Sir,1 aw directed by the Minister of Munitions to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant No. 5?/Genal-follow/9554 (tf/S I: S.), relating to the question of the storage, handling, and movement of 3tores surplus to Army requirements.The Minister entirely concurs in the vier c*&apos; the Army Council as to the importance of a definite understanding being arrived at as to the respective responsibilities of the &apos;,Tar&apos;Office and the Ministry of Munitions in regard to this matter, but lie had been under the impression that such an under-standing had already been reached and that effect has been given ^ to it by the Army Council Instruction No.304, to which reference is made in your letter under reply.    He had regarded that Instruction, which was only promulgated as recently as the 8th of the present monthf not as embodying a merely transitional arrangement, but as defining^once for all the respective spheres of the Army and the Ministry, wherever and so long as both Departments were concerned in transactions connected with the stores in question and there was, therefore, a possibility of doubt arising as to their relative responsibility in the matter.Nor can the Minister accept the view expressed in the third paragraph of your letter that the storage, handling, and conservation, until it can be properly disposed of, of property r:hich has been purchased and imported into the oh eat re of war for the purpose of the Army, can be regarded as a &quot;purely civilian duty&quot;.    He v-ould on the contrary have regarded this function as definitely the responsibility for the War Office, and indeed as one of the most important duties at present falling to be discharged by your Department.The responsibility of the Ministry of Munitions is, and in the opinion of Lord Inverforth, should continue to be,, strictly limited, as regards all property declared to be surplus In the theatres of *mr, to determining the method of disposal to be adopted (including the fixing of prices fcc), and communicating to the Deputy Quartermaster General of the Command information as to the administrative arrangements necessary to fulfil the disposal requirements, it being the duty of that officer, as indicated in your circular letter to Commands No.S7/Gen.No./9239 of the 25th February last, to give orders to Corps or Departments to carry out the disposal instructions.soy. /Di spo sals/7 t/2.Secretary, ar Office,
1  * t 0i air. to point out that it v-ould he quite impossible in existing circumstances for the Ministry to improvise without excessive delay the neoessary Staff and machinery for carrying out the executive and administrative duties connected with the handling, sorting, inventorying movement, storage f-c^, of the vast quantities of stores involved, scattered as they are over ^ide areas; and further, that even if such a course were practicable, any system under which two virtually duplicate organisations were established side by side in each theatre of war, one of which vrould be responsible for handling., movement, storage &amp;o.t of stores up to the time at which they were declared surplus to requirements, and the other for carrying out the same functions after that time, would not only be inj the highest degree wasteful and extravagant, but would also Jfe likely to lead to overlapping of functions, ill-defined responsibility, and other serious administrative difficulties.Lord Inverforth therefore regrets that lie is unable to concur in the adoption of the arrangements suggested ih the fifth paragraph of your letter, although, as regards Collecting Stations or Parks in the United Kingdom which contain only disposal stores, he would be billing to consider in consultation with your Department whether the Ministry is in a position to render any assistance which might enable a gradual reduction of military personnel to be effected.X am to add that the Minister iss fully alive to the importance of disposing rapidly, and as far as possible in bulk, of the immense quantities of stores in the various theatres of war and particularly in the Eastern area of Prance       Ke is moving the Foreign Office to endeavour to secure an early agreement with the Prench Government, and it possible with the other Allies, as to the ;waiver of customs duties on the scale of surplus stores; and provided that a satisfactvrj. deoision is obtained on this question it is hoped that rapid progress may be made in the sale of such property       has already been reported as surplus.   The Minister also appreciates the 4    : cuvlv experienced by the Military Authorities in safeguarding stores from depreciation due to weashfu conditions, and from pilfering and depredation; and in regard to the latter point he had already suggested to the Army Council in the Ministry letter of the 25th April that the protection of such property as &apos;-fas specially liable to depredation might be entrusted to a Corps of Commfcsfionaires recruited from disabled soldiers.1 am, Sir,Your obedient Servant, (Sgd.)   W.Oraham Greene.
