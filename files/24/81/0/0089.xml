Military Secret. 942 \&amp;db*suu-*mW 4,.Front Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India,lblhJiinc 1919.     -   &apos;. . ....(Received 3 p.in.)&apos;   8093.   1 Jlh June.1. Malleson in his telegram M.-D.O. 1755. 10th June, refers to our orders of April last, in which he was informed that object of maintaining his force in Khorasan was to% protect north-east Persia from Bolshevik incursion vide your telegram-No; nil, 9th February. -2. He says : --(I) With arrival of Bolshevik forces on the Kaahka-Dushak section of Persian frontier, and their probable imminent arrival at Sarakhs, contingency contemplated in your telegram matures.(2) At present 1 have 100 levies at Bajgiram, 200 men 98th Infantry&apos; at Kuehaii, and remaining troops concentrated at Meshed.(3) Is it desired that I should notify Bolshevik and Afghan Commanders that any infraction of Persian border will be resisted by our troops ?(4) Since your telegram was despatched, question has been complicated by hostilities with Afghanistan. There is a more warlike tone in Herat, according to latest reports. News spread by me of Amir&apos;s application for cessation of hostilities lias reached most people on and beyond border. It is not generally believed. Even if true, it is argued, it is only Afghan dodge to gain time. Feeling among Afghans here, and among whole frontier, is that Afghan. Government is merely waiting till end of Ramzan when war will, be begun in earnest. By that time, it is said, large numbers of-troops and much Bolshevik assistance, will assure success. .....:;.(5) Talk everywhere amongst Afghans in Western Afghanistan is that when things are ripe they will attack Sistan in force, sever our communications, and that then regulars and Bolsheviks together will proceed to destroy our force in Khorassan.(6) There is no doubt that what now looks like military operations of Trans-Caspian troops will greatly encourage both Bolsheviks and Afghans. &apos;(? Magistrates) and party from Caucasus are continually landing on &apos;(? same)&apos; Caspian shore with view primarily to raise Vamuts, and generally to spread Jihad. Local Caucasus Turks, as always, are actively talking against&apos;(? word omitted). &quot;(7) Some definite indication of British policy seems desirable. &apos;3. Our force in East Persia now amounts to four squadrons Indian Cavalry and seven Companies Indian Infantry at Meshed (including one Company at Kucheii) and two squadrons and 11 Companies on lines of communication between Meshed and Duzdap. In addition there are about 2,000 Khorassan and Seistan levies, 1,200 Persian gendarmerie and 250 Persian Cossacks in Khorassan and Seistan,4. The presence of our troops at Meshed enables us to keep touch with develop-ments in Central Asia.   &apos;5. Total Bolshevik strength in Turkestan is estimated at 10,000 but owing to lack of organisation and transport it is improbable that more than half of that number could take the field away from railway and bulk of these would be Austro-Hungariau prisoners whose attitude towards campaign in Persian would be doubtful. The only road from Transeaspia southwards to Khorassan. fit for wheeled traffic is via (? Askabad) and other two via Sarakha and via Diveli Btiiposs are lit for pack transport only. Along two (? latter) routes supplies would be scarce until Meshed Valley was reached.0. We consider Malleson has at his disposal sufficient force to meet any probable Bolshevik incursion, but it is doubtful whether he has sufficient force to meet an Afghan and Bolshevik combination, and Ave have therefore directed him, as a precautionary measure, and as a last resort, to prepare plans for gradual withdrawal of Indian troops towards railhead at Duzdap, but no move to be made without reference to us. With our present commitments on North-West Frontier we cannot send him any large reinforcements, and in any case could not maintain additional forces beyond railhead.
7. Afghans could dispose of some 4,500 regular troops, with 24 guns from. Herat area. They would have some difficulty in maintaining these numbers1 in Persian territory so long as the Persians were hostile to them. Our advance to Jelalabad, with its threat to Kabul, would encourage anti-Auiamilla sections in Afghanistan, and may be expected to have deterrent effect on offensive plans from Herat. It is to be remembered that according to reports the greater part of Herat garrison was recently sent orders to proceed to Kabul, which the local Commander did not issue as lie knew that they would not be obeyed.8. In Seistan, the Afghans could dispose of some 1,500 troops, with six guns, but operations in this area are unlikely for climatic reasons until after September. By drawing on the Kandahar garrison, these numbers could be increased, but We should be able to prevent this by a demonstration from Chaman.0. For the present the chief danger appears to lie in an attack in Khorassan. It seems entirely inadvisable for General Malleson to notify the Bolshevik and Afghan Commanders as he suggests as this might merely serve to provoke without deterring them. Close military co-operation between Afghan and Bolsheviks is improbable, and even if effected is unlikely to become dangerous without considerable warning. At the same time Malleson should be prepared against contingency of a concerted and simultaneous attack in superior force, which might as a last resort force hinr to vvilh-draw to the neighbourhood of Kain and so cover his line of retreat. In our opinion such withdrawal should not be contemplated until it has been clearly established that concerted operations are being directed against him, and then only on a direct order from the Commander-in-Chief. Once begun, however, it should be carried through without, hesitation and without regard (o any bad effect likely to be produced in Persia. (Corrupt group) Jose all touch with Central Asia.10. We understand that intervention with regular troops in Russian Turkestan is (? still) contrary to the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, so we are not considering effect of such action.11. Our conclusions are briefly as follows:-(1) Malleson should be strong-enough to deal with any Bolsheviks fur the Afghan force that can bo brought against him if he can engage them separately and in detail. (2) He may not be strong enough to deal with both simultaneously. (3) It is desirable to remain in Meshed as long as possible in order  to keep in touch with Central Asia affairs and \o steady East Persia. (4) In the event of a combined attack developing against Malleson with which he is unable to deal, he should, as a last resort, withdraw to the Kain area.12. We should be glad to know if His Majesty&apos;s Government approve instructions on the above lines being issued to General Malleson.
