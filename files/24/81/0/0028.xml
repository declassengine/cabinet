Winter wheat generally looks well, but spring corn in some districts.is making little progress owing to the drought, and there are further reports of attack by wircwor/EeLand Division.(i ) La nd Settlement.&quot; Aupli cat ions for Small Holdings.   - The follovang is a summary of a return obtained by the Board showing the number of applications received by Local Authorities:-Local Author i tyCoui^ty, Csainoi IsEnglandAppli 2 at ions fromBevice- o:r ox-Co: v j. cr- w nApjp 1 i c at ions from.CI.V3,lb ans ,Total.Nq,r f Appl.&apos;&apos; cant *No - of&quot;Valeacreage, a .--------   Appj leant s11,797 707215.

The area of land acquired by the Board under the Small Holding Colonies Act, 1916, remains at 12,012 acres* in seven localities.    Negotiations are at present in progress for the acquisition of several other Estates.The number of ex-Service men at the Farm Settlements is now 156 and of these 62 have been settled on holdings.The settlement at Pembroy was visited during the week and sites were chosen for sixteen cottages.     The building of these cottages will be commenced by the Office of 7orks as soon as possible. A hut is being erected to serve as a Hostel for ex-Service men during their probationary period.    The crops on this Settlement are looking i.7cll and all oats have now been sown.    The sowing Of mangels and planting of potatoes will be completed this week.    Tenders have been invited for repairs to buildings and cottages.    All the stock looks well and a large number of bullocks will be ready for sale at the end of June.At Fatrington all crops and stock are looking well,The planting of potatoes at Holbeach was completed during the week.     The riddling of last year&apos;s crop is being proceeded with, but the potatoes are not being got away as quickly as desired, owing to the difficulty of obtaining the necessary trucks.Five, additional ex-Service men have been given holdings on the Heath Hill Colony during tho week.(ii)* A slight correction has been found to bo necessary in the acreage given in the previous reports.
o t(ii) ^Vork of Agricultural Executive. Committees .Cultivation of Lands (Conrnitteeq))Order, 1919.     In accordance with the terms of thj.s&quot;order the BVard&apos; have &quot;now appointed the majorTty^-of their nominees on the new Agricultural Executive Committees.     It is expected that all Committees will meet at an early date to appoint their officers, and to consider their future work, and in this connecticn a memorandum has been circulated dealing with the organisation and duties of the nev Committees, and the question of &apos; their staff.*^eterminatjon of Tenancies.     Two determination orders of tenancy were served lasc \veek,     In one case, at the request of the West Sussex Count;/ Council and after consultation v/ith the Agricultural Executive Committee, the tenancy of one of the Council&apos;s small holdings of about 22 acres of land,   the holding was reported to be in a disgraceful condition;   about 10 acres had been ploughed and sown with spring corn, but was found to be very foul;   4 acres of stubble had -been untouched sines harvest.     The County Council have undertaken to indemnify the Board against any claim by the tenant in consequence of the determination of his tenancy under v.- /-Regulation 21,&apos;        Relaying, of land to, grass.     Several Committees have enquired whether the freedom of cropping which is being allowed this season to good farmers, includes liberty to relay land broken up last year by order of the Committee.     Tho position is that any farmer may relay land to grass unless a further order, is served on him by the Committee requiring that the land shall continue to be cultivated as arable land.     The Board havo advised Committees that they would be justified in making such an order in cases where it would not be in accordance with good husbandry to relay the land;   for example whore it is foul, owing to the taking of two corn crops in succession. In one case a Commit toe sought to make it a condition of relaying certain land broken up by a Golf Club under their Order?, that, she Club should make bo claim for compensation for loss on the cultivation, of the land.     Tho Board had to point out to the Committee that, as their permission to relay the land was not required, they could not make such a condition.Payment of Grass Seeds for Relaying.     Where it is desired to relay land broken up by order of the Agricultural Executive Committee that has been found unsuitable for arable cultivation, tho Board have approved of an arrangement whereby the Committee will pay for the cost of grass seeds up to a specified maximum per acre, on condition that such payment is accepted in full settlement of all claims arising out of the Cultivation Order served by the Commi ctee.(ill) Provision of land for Allotments.Slep^crd.     The Urban District Council have now arranged to take on lease for a term of&apos; years 10 acres of arable land acquired for allotments during the V/ar, together with a further quantity of 25 acres.$?:IsJ.njgton^Petjsrborough.-&quot;.  In March. 1917, the Board, in the exercise if&apos; &quot;the Jr&quot; pone r sT under the Defence of the ilsolm Regulation&quot; 2l; entetea on a plot of land known as The Pound, Kassirgton, and authorised the village- schoolmaster to arirnge for its cultivation by the scholars of the viliege school.     This has been can led out ^successfully during the       ,     The agent to the Icrd of the Manor (-Ka;i:ir Leonard Brassy   M.p.. ) has now agreed to allow the V3l.lc.ge School master to continue in occupation on a yearly tenancy at a nominal rent of Id. per annum.
(lv)   Land Drainage,Work in Norfolk and gagj guffoik.    On the Waveney, 14 miles abflve Bung ay have been cleared of 3ilt and weeds&apos;, and 3t miles from Hoxne kill.     In many places 40 oubio feet of mud to the yard had to &quot;he removedo     Unfortunately, however, there is an interval pf 7 cr    miles between these two cleared stretoheo, whioh has been left untouched because a prisoner of war oamp cannot be obtained near enough to bring the prisoners to the work, and nc means of transport are available,The Yaro has &quot;been cleared for 1-J- miles from Trcwse (just below Norwich) to above its junction with the Tas, and the Tas for four miles above the junction^     The Wejisum has been cleared for two stretches of 6 and 3 miles respectively;   these rivers wer3 in a better condition generally than the Waveney, and the clearance of the worst stretches has been effected, the remainder being comparatively unimportant.The above does not exhaust the clearances effected by the Norfolk Executive Committee;   other works will be inspected in June.     Work is now being carried out on the Wissey and That by a concentration of prisoners,,The clearing work on the River Dove, a tributary of the Waveney, in East Suffolk, has also been inspected;   very satisfactory work has been done, and the river cleared of silt banks and fallen trees for 3-^ miles;    it is hoped to complete a considerable further stretch by concentrating the prisoners before they are withdrawn,!     The greater part of what remains to be done is the removal of fallen timber.-Yorkshire fNorth Riding).     The total length of stream which has Veen freed of weeds, trees, bushes and similar obstructions during the past two years is approximately 45-g- miles,     A considerable length of the, bo&amp;s ef these streams have been bottomed out and graded., The chief streams on whioh work has been done are the Swale, the Foes, and the Kyle, but many smaller streams have also been dealt with-, and the work of the Executive Committee has led owners of land in several cases to take in hand the streams running through their estates,     The wsrk done by these cwners is not included&apos; in the above figures.Ncttj3,     2,570 chains of drains have been put in order in the parishes cf Ererton, Gringley cn the Kill and Mistertcn, and about 3,900 acres have received substantial benefits     The work was done by the Everton Drainage Commission, at the instance of the Executive Committee.    Prisoner labour was employed;   the total cost cf the labour was  1,010, of which half was remitted as it was thought inequitable that the present cwners should havo to bear the whole cost of works rendered necessary by the neglect cf many year?..Scheme under Section 15 cf the Act of 1913.     At the request of the Dorset Executive Committee, the River Piddle was reported upon by sne cf the Beard&apos;s Inspectors, and after discussion with certain landowners a scheme for dealing with the river under Section 15 cf the Act cf 1918 was prepared by the Executive committee     The river has been neglected -for many years, and the adjoining meadows, 595 acres in extent, which are in the hands of a small number of cwners, have very greatly deteriorated.     The scheme, when deposited, was met by objections from four proprietors, owning 472 acres cut of the ^   595 acres concerned.     The Executive Committee arranged a conference
Q f\with the objectors to ascertain their views as to the best means of restoring the land near the river to its former value, but found that those owners were unanimous in objecting to any description of concerted action, and in holding that each riparian proprietor should be left tp do what he thinks best for his own interests.     There is therefore no alternative but to drop the scheme.(v)   Tithe, Commons, Copyhold and Survey,,,The number of applications for redemption continues to show a substantial increase as compared with previous years0     The following statement shown the extent of this increase Is.at month as compared with the corresponding month in previous years.$ l&amp;l Number of Total rent-1st to 31sfr             2L%&apos;^ifi  5pPPi?if-ri ofcargetolj Nations,   applications.

The Fertiliser laanufacturers5 Association are, however, much concerned with regard to the difficulties in obtaining the necessary shipping to enable thegE. to lift the Rook from North Africa.     The Ministry of Shipping state that, in accordance with the general policy, tonnage for this material must be chartered in the open market, but that every facility in the way of licenses will be given when a shio has been O
definitely chartered.     It is understood that the difficulty which is &quot;being experienced in regard to shipping is due to tho fast that before the war-a large amount of. tonnage from the Mediterranean for this country was carried in neutral vessels, and it will only be possible to restore the trade to its normal condition by again attracting neutral voe.se.ls to carry rook ac rates which are as favourable as those offered for the carriage of Iron Ore and Pyrites..ki^e.     Technical advice is being given to various firms engaged in lime production;   as a result, it is anticipated that a supply of ground limestone will shortly be available in the South Wales area.     Alterations have boon suggested in the lime-grinding plant of one firm, and a considerably increased output is expected as soon as these alterations have been carried into effect.     In the Yorkshire area, one firm visited weie found to be progressing rapidly with a new and large plant for producing finely ground limestone. This firm had hitherto only supplied small quantities of comparatively coarsely ground stone.Seed bill the Board of Agriculture   for Scotland, having referred&quot;&quot;the draft of the proposed Bill confirming the requirements of the present Testing of Seeds Order to the. Scottish Seed Trade for their consideration, an early meeting of the Seeds Advisory Committee has been arranged in order that the views of the English Seed Trade. on the proposed Bill may be obtained at once.B.9-9,l-S^.cL^?-^.2.(&apos;     Reports from the seed-growing districts show that the swede plants are being seriously damaged by canker and by insect attacks.     Rain at an Barly date might overcome the insect troublej but plants affected with canker will be useless for seed purposes, and the outlook in all districts is very unsatisfactory. Very small quantities of swede seed of the 1918 crop are being carried over so that there will probably be a comparative shortage of this seed for next season&apos;s sowingo     The condition of the Turnip and Mangel plants is more satisfactory but all are badly in need of rain.Horticultural.Division*County Organisation*Isle of Ely,     The Education Committee with the sanction of the County Council are calling a Conference of growers with the object of securing their active co-operation in the organisation of horticulture in the county.     A representative of the Board will address the Conference,West Suffolk,     A Horticultural Sub-Committee under the Agricultural Education Committee has been formed in this county, with iir,, Bilsland as Chairman,,     Pour members of the Education Committee have been appointed and the remainder of the Committee 1b to be co-opted from the different horticultural interests,,PlL^-ann     Steps are being taken to form a Horticultural Sub-Committfee&quot;under the-Education Committee on the lines laid down by the Board,

The annual meeting of the Visbech Fruit Growers&apos; Association was held on the 24th ult* when there was an attendance of over 200.     The main points discussed were (l) Postal arrangements,. (2) Railway Facilities, (3) Cheap Return Tickets for Casual Labour and (4) The Cambridge Commercial Fiuit Show,     The general opinion of fruit prospects expressed was that all fruit except apples will be a light crop,     The Spraying Scheme organised by the Worcestershire Horticultural Sub-Committee has been a decided success, 17 large and 24 smaller orchards having been pruned in spite of the difficulty caused by lack of labour^     Many growers seeing their trees defoliated by caterpillars are anxious to take advantage of the scheme, and requests are being met as quickly as transport difficulties will allow,Bee-Keeplng,     The reception and transfer of Italian Queens has been going on during the week under the Board&apos;s Bee Restocking Scheme.Fruit and Vegetable Preservation.     A very successful exhibit was held at the Royal Horticultural Society&apos;s Show, Chelsea, and reports received by the Board1s Chief Demonstrator showed that the demonstrations held last year had given a great impetus to the work of fruit and vegetable preservation in the country generally,.     One instance was quoted to the demonstrator by. a lady living at Farnham Royal, Buckinghamshire, who after receiving instruction at the Board1s Canning Kitchen decided to stcrt a Depotc     She collected a capital of  300, and started work in a cowshed, which was converted for the purpose;   her original scheme was to preserve the fruit grown on about three acres of  round.     The success of this Depot has been so great however that in epite of the fact that two additional acres of fruit have been planted, a large quantity of fruit has new to be purchased to keep the Depot fully employed.     This Depot now consists of seven Army Huts in addition to the original shed, and it is proposed at an.early date to increase still further the accommodation.     The profit last year, after paying all expenses, including bonus, grant to Sinking Fund and allowance for depreciation; was ,2500.     The working expenses include the sum of  300 and  2QQ respectively&apos;paid to the kanager and Sub-iianagcr.(

This disease has never been investigated in detail, but it was exceedingly prevalent last year, and questions were raised regarding the amount of damage oaused.     Resenrch was carried out, and from the results it appears that although the fungus does not cause material damage to the flesh of the tuber (being prevented from reaching the inner layer by the formation of cork), it is liable to cause serious injury in &quot;seed&quot; potatoes by killing or weak&amp;ning the &quot;eyes&quot;.    The disease is especially prevalent in Scotch &quot;seed&quot; and its development in all prebability was oonsidersbly favoured by bad methods of storage.    The work is being continued over another season.Utilisation of Explosives. -   Since the signing of the Annietioe considerable attention has been paid to the possibility of using the stores of explosives for agricultural purposes.    This problem had been anticipated, and as occasion offered it had been attacked at Rothamsted during 1917.    One of the most urgent needs was to find ! a method ef   using ammonium nitrate on the fern.    Enormous stocks of this material became available at the cessation of hostilities, but hitherto it has not been used as a fertiliser owing to certain undesirable properties whioh presented grave difficulties in practice.   These difficulties, however, have now to a large extent been successfully overcome.A more difficult problem, not yet completely solved, is the utilisation of the considerable stocks of cordite now available.. Experiments have been instituted, in conjunction with officers of the Ministry of Munitions, and considerable progress has already been made.Seed Testing Station.-   The number of samples received ft* testing during tne month of May was 1759.    The testing season is continuing much longer than last year.    This Is in part due to the lateness in threshing out seed, but it is made to appear to be later owing te the fact that &quot;control samples&quot; which came in during February, March and April had to be put aside owing to the large number of samples being received from farmers and the Trade.Tractor Section.During the week ended 16th May, 2942 tractors were in the hands of Committees and 1030 of these were being operated unitr the new Tractor Scheme.    Of the 1912 operated by Committees directly, 228 were being got ready for sale, leaving 1684 available. Of these, 1062 (or 63$) were in commission and were idle for only q% of the time on account of bad weather.    305 tractors were idle through lack of work, 292 were under repair and 25 were not being worked owing to labour shortage.in England and Wales 7,462 acres were ploughed and 23,843 cultivated by 1525 tractors, giving an average of 4*9 acres and 15.6 acres respectively.    The acreage dealt with shows an increase over the previous week of 6% in the case of ploughing and 36$ in the ease of cultivating. ^   The highest average screage was again dealt with in Anglesey, where 20 tractors ploughed 87 acres and cultivated 881:   average 4.4 and 44 acres respectively.The number of tractors to be retained by Committees is now approximately 1350 out of 4050.r^auiroments and Disposal Section.During the week ended 31st May, returns of sales have been forwarded by Derby, West and Bast Sussex, West Riding, Oxon, /     Nottingham, Wiltshire, Devonshire, Warwick, Leicester, Cheshire

The number of allowances at present authorised for farm gaining in England and Wales is 1.000 only.     The Board have therefore jpplied to the Treasury for authority to increase this number at once to J&apos;500, and also that where an allowance is not held by a selected candidate for the full period of two years, the vacancy so caused may be filled by some other approved applicant for the unexpired term.l&amp;ZW 3- P&amp;Ji8J&apos;%L$ 2.4 Si $5*    A few County Committees - particularly the &quot;Home&quot;CouriHes&apos;7&quot;    ieporVthat they are finding some difficulty in getting further farmers to come forward to train i;offioer pupils1&apos; r    In its case of Surrey it has been neceseary to di-verfc all fresh&quot;applications for training in that County to other Counties,     It will probably be necessary for the Board to make a special appeal to farmers to offer to take &quot;officer pupils&quot; for training on their farms,^SIi9.yl^I^training^^Overeeas.

Of the latter allowances 100 will be allotted to &quot;officer pupils&quot; selected from amongst those who receive residential farm training in England or Sales, and the remainder (20) from Agricultural Scholarship holders.It is expected that there will be a very large demand for these overseas allowances, when the matter becomes generally known.Detailed preliminary arrangements as to the award of these ; allowances will be made as soon as possible, in consultation with the Colonial Office, Imperial Education Committee, and the Ministry of Labour,ELnancJaViassistance to j?x-Serv.1 ce Agricu 1 tural ,Student s to complete&apos;, their ::brairriiig.

Among them may be mentioned the following.
/ On the report from the Committee which had &quot;been appointed toconsider the various criticisms and suggestions made by members of District Wages Committees at the conference of District &quot;/ages Committees held on 7th May, the Board decided to adopt the     ! :.-following rules;-(l)   That no unanimous decision of a District Wages Committee shall be altered by the Wages Board until the District Committee has been furnished with the Board&apos;s reasons, and has had an opportunity of further considering the matter.(2)   That after the question of harvest rates has been dealt with, every Notice of Proposal before being passed by the Board for publication shall be sent in draft to the District Wages Committee concerned for consideration and report before the next meeting of the Wages Board.(3)   That copies of the Press Notice of the Board&apos;s meetings shall be sent to all members of the District Wages   -Committees ono clear day before the Nctice is issued to the Press.(4)   That in addition to dealing with actual Orders made, the Press Notice might properly deal with Proposals and other matters not finally settled, subject to proper safeguards and the omission of specific figures. , &apos;The Board considered, county by county, the recommendations made by the various District Wages Committees as to the fixing of special rates for corn harvest and decided to issue proposals to fix such special rates in the following areas:-   Cambs., Hunts., and Beds; Cheshire;   Derby;   Dorset;   Gloucestershire;   Herefordshire;   Lines; Notts;   Oxon;    Salop;    Somerset;    Suffolk;    Surrey;   Wilts;   Yorkshire; Anglesey and Carnarvon,, and Denbigh and Flint;   in the case of Devon the decision of the Board to fix special rates for Corn Harvest was contingent upon the receipt of a unanimous recommendation from the District Wages Committee.&apos;    No special rates for Corn Harvest will be fixed in the case of the other areas in England and Wales, and the payment for        harvest in such areas will accordingly be a matter for mutual arrangement between employers and workers, subject to payment of the workers at not less than the minimum and overtime rates applicable to them under the Orders of the Wages Board already in force.     Notice of the Board&apos;s proposal to fix special rates for Corn Harvest in the areas mentioned above will be published in due course.The Board, having consulted the various District Wages Committees,&apos;decided to issue a Notice of Proposal to increase the minimum and overtime rates at present in operation for female workers of IC years of age and over.     No variation in the present rates can be macte, however, until&apos; the expiration of a month from the date of the Notice of Proposal.Considerable discussion took place with regard to the question of a variation in the minimum rates at present applicable to boys and to girls.     It was eventually decided not to vary the present rates for boys and for girls; but steps will be taken to provide that, in the case of those areas where the hours on which the weekly wages for boys are based in excess of 54 in summer and 43 in winter, or    i in excess of 52 all the year round, such hours shall be reduced to 54 Ln summer and 48 in winter without any reduction in the weekly wages.The next meeting of the Wages Beard will be held on the 3rd or 4th July.*
