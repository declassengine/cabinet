G.T. 7421.WAR CABINET.(: KB CEKTFALI SAT I OH OP THE MINISTRY Off PENSIONS *Note &quot;by the preventive^erit^JMihe^ Bosrd^^f^J-u^tion onTtlTe ffiffipo eaT To &quot;^TuTethe&quot; S b af F&quot;b Ft he Mi ii JLfc t ry of PeniI^is^n&quot;3Fo Albany Ho ad School s, Car dif f *......     (&quot;g.T-. &quot;7389 TA3 President of the Board of Education I cannot acquiesce in this proposal.   The Board have &quot;been subjected to strong criticism for their inability to secutie earlier evacuation of school build-ings occupied for military purposes and I cannot afford to lend any colour to the charge that the Government are continuing co sacrifice educational to other interests after hostilities have ceased and the immediate need has passed,   My refusal to sanction this proposal has been advertised and warmly welcomed in the Press, and public feeling against the occupation of schools and other buildings by Government staffs is so keen that there is bound to be an outcry if I am now compelled to withdraw from my position.The argument is advanced that in any case, owing to shortage of labourf it would be impossible even for a start to be made before September upon the work of readapbing the   buildings for sbhool. purposes by which time it is &quot;expected&quot; that other premises will be ready for the Pensions Staff.itOn this I would observe :-1.   That if labour is so scarce (which I do not accept) there is a danger that the other premises will not be read by September and&apos; that the schools could not be evacuated by that date, and presumably would not be ready for use as schools until the end of the year.2.   That I cannot believe that at a time when there is serious ijnd widespread unemployment the Cardiff Corpora-tion could not find the labour to readapt the schools for school purposes between now and September if they were in earnest about the matter.The record of Cardiff as regards school accommodation is bad and the situation in that Town is serious.   The Cardiff Authority has in the past proved lax in providing school accommodation. Three years before the War its grant was reduced by a substantial sum for habitually overcrowding some of its schools.   Only one tie&quot;&quot; Elementary School has been built in the City in the last 15 years No Town has suffered more seriously than Cardiff daring the TSi-ir through the occupation of school premises by the Military;    ore child in five has been affected by this and been obliged&quot;to acterd a school conducted on the very unsatisfactory double--shift system in Cardiff at present the buildings of five Elementary Schools, with accommodation for 7,063 children, and the buildings of three Secondary Schools, with accommodation for 1,0?0 children are still in military occupation or not yet restored ffo use as; schools, 11I submit that this is not a time to retain for non-educatio &apos; al purposes school   buildings with accommodation for 1*577 children.(Signed)   H. A. L. PISHER. fifth June, 1919.
