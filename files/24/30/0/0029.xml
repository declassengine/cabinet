1       sjLO-l-id       G. T,,-2429!                      W A,R__.0 A B I M E T9f            COMf M3ATI0I&apos; FOR DAMAGE DOB 3 BY AIR RAIDS.Memorandum by Mr. Stanley Baldwin, iLPa           The War Cabinet decided on Ootobor 4th (War Cabinet     245) that a complete indemnity for the destruction of     property caused directly by an enemy air raid up to a     maximum of  500 should be payable by the Government without     insurance, but anything over that figure must be covered by     insurance,  The Treasury were instructed to produce a     scheme in detail to ^ive effect to this decision, and tc     publish the same as soon as possible./          The attached scheme, which has been prepared by the     Treasury and the Board of Trade with their advisers, gives     effect to this decision.  Owners of property not exceeding      500 get full cover against all tho risks covered by the     Government policy,,  Owners of property exceeding  500 are     givon in effect the benefit of a freee policy for  500 if     they require it, provided that ell value in excess of      500 is insured under the Government Insurance Scheme.           As the free policy is a free gift, it is not     unreasonable to require that the remainder of the property     be  insured with the Government, and it would in practice bo     extremely difficult to work the scheme if policies issued     outside the Government schemo had to bo taken into account.           The scheme is ready to put into operation at once,     and the question for the V/ar Cabinet to decide is from what     date it should take effect.   The Prime Minister&apos;s soeech     to  the deputation at which something of this kind was
                              -       promised was made on July 13th.   The objections to going     back ciS far as that are that it  would be difficult now     to get at the facts,  ynd who damage- has probably to a .     large extent been made ^ood.  From the ooiht of     view of mere administration, October 1st would be a     good date,  for the new office would be able to &quot;startfairly     clearo    But if September 1st is chosen, it would     include the moonlight raids.           It is suggested that the scheme might be     announced by means of a friendly question in the House     of Commons./    Draft attached,                            (Signed)    STANLEY BALD&apos;:II!...Treasury,  S      2 it hM0ctpber^ 1917,
HOUSE OF COMMONS.229MR...................             to ask the Prime Minister whether he  is  in a position        to make any statement as  to  the compensation  to be given        for damage to  property caused by air  raids. MR . BONAR LAW -              A scheme has been prepared for  giving owners of        property not exceeding  500  in value  compensation for        damage done by air raids  and bombardment without payment        of any premium.
