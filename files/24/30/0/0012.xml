/IJIJMBNT IS THE PROPERTY&apos;OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENTWAR   CABINET.2.         A  NOTE  ON   TONNAGE.By  the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs .          I am compelled to press upon the Cabinet, with allthe power I can command, the gravity of the tonnage situationThe subject is not obviously within my Department, butcertain salient facts of the case have been brought to mynotice, partly by the representations of the French andItalian Ambassadors about the wheat position in theirrespective countries, parti:/ by the results of certain-statistical investigations which I am making at the requestof the Prime Minister..          I regard it as incontestable that the wheatposition, both in Italy and France, is of a very seriouscharacter.  The Italian and French reserves are very low,and are still diminishing.   Unless some thing be done,and done quickly, a condition of actual want is in sight;and neither of the two Governments are prepared to guaranteethe steadfastness of their population through the Wintermonths if they have not a sufficiency of bread.   The ItalianGovernment have been thoroughly-^ and , as far as I can see,justly--frightened by the food riots in Turin, which weresuppressed only after a great loss of life; and the FrenchAmbassador talked of the possibility of famine as earlyas January next.   In my opinion, therefore, some reliefmust be provided for this situation, at whatever cost inother directions .          So much for the diplomatic side of the question .I now turn to the shipping side .          The enquiry which the Prime Minister asked meto undertake involves some estimate of the rate at whichAmerican forces could be brought to the European theatreof war.  Obviously this depends in no small measure uponthe shipping available, and in this connection I put somequestions to the Ministry of Shipping.  They have sent mea paper (GMT,2386&apos; herewith); which reveals a most seriousstate of things .  It proves conclusively that we shall notbe able to give any assistance to the United States asregards the transport of their troops .  It also provesthat unless, in addition to transporting their troops,the United States can give us substantial assistance intonnage , the European Allies are faced with a problem ofextreme difficulty . &apos;          It seems that on the most sanguine estimate forwhich the Ministry of Shipping are prepared to make themselveresponsible , our Imports in 1913 will be 3- million tonsless than they were, in 1917.  This assumes that Americacan lin this respect); give us no assistance, but thatneutrals and European Allies will provide shipping on thesame relative scale as in the current year .
          If this estimate is anything like the truth,it is evident that we ought at once to consider whatimports should be cut down and how soon the processof cutting down ought to begin .          It seems that out of the 37; million tons ,(exclusive of Admiralty oil); which were Imported in1917, 15 million tons were required for munitions and14 million tons were foodstuffs .  If we estimate thatin 1918 the same amount of tonnage is required for munitionsand for foodstuffs, we shall not be able to importa single ton of anything else ^ba^ever, either in the natureof raw&quot; material or manufactured articles.  This is equivalentto saying that , that unless we can withdraw ships frommilitary operations, or unless the Americans can lend usships, we musii cut down heavily our imports of food ormunitions - or both.          The matter, I venture to think, is of greaturgency and I hope the Cabinet will investigate itwithout delay . Initialled)  A.  J.  B.FOREIGN OFFICE,27th October ,  1917 .
