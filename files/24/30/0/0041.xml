Colonel Jones26713779a/l?CErttH, CONTROL BOARD (LIQUOR TRAFFIC)*Proposed increase in withdrawal of wines and spiritsfrom bond.   1.   In reply to the Prime Minister*s request of the17th October the Central Control Board submit the follow-ihg observations on Mr.  O^rady1^ letter of the 15th Oct-opportunity thus afforded them of placing their views onrecord, for the information of tho Prime Minister and ofthe War Cabinet, in view particularly of the fact thatsince the Prime Ministers request for their observationswas received, they have been informed that on the  6thOctober the Pood Controller&apos; proposed to the War Cabinetthat the release of wines from bond should be permitted upto the pre-war standard, and of spirits up to two-thirdsof.that standard.   2.   The policy of restricted output of intoxicatingliquor was adopted, not on the Board1s advice, nor to meetobjects with which they have to deal, but, it is believed,with a view to meet the general requirements of the foodsituation.  The Board are specially charged to dealwith the relationship between excessive drinking and thewar-efficiency of the nation, and they are,not fully in-formed of the reasons upon which the present restrictionson the delivery of wines and spirits from bond were based,and still less as to the reasons for now relaxing thoserestrictions.  Prom the Board1s point of view, a heavyrestriction upon the normal output of beer such as is nowin operation, even with the special increase allowed forober with reference to a suggested increase in the suppliesof wines and spirits.    The Board are glad of thethe/

While  this scarcity  continues,  the Board could not  take Responsibility for  the  effect on war-effioiency of the  present proposal to increase the  supplies of spirits from 50 por cent of  the- 1916  delivery  to two-thirds of the pre-war standaixU    3.  The emormcus fall  in  the convictions for  drunkenness which could be recorded at the end  of  1916,  has progressed Still furthenduring  the last  10 months.  It is  no doubt probable that the  scarcity Of  beer  has in  some  districts- contributed to this  result, but there  is evidence to  shew (l).that in other  districts it has  l d to an undesirable increase of spirit drinking, and ( ) that even  apart   from spirit drinking, the scantVj unequal and intermittent  supplies ef beer have led to  scesies and practices which  are prejudicial to public order and  efficiency^  Few things could be worse tharj&amp;lternatlons of &quot;rush&quot;  drinking and drink famine, a d9 whilet  ... the consumption of intoxicating liquors  is permitted at allj    measures taken should aim at seouring, so far as-                                                &apos; possible /
October 30,  1917,...possible,  a  regularity  of  supply.  From this point  of  view, Mr.  0*GracLy*s  suggestion  that during  the  Christmas  season  there should  be  an  increased delivery of spirits  (with a view to their being obtainable  at a lower price)  appears to the. Board to be open to grave objection.   The  fluctuation in the supply would, it mcjy be  anticipated, be attended by the same undesirable results which  hasre recent- ly attended flucdniations in the supply  of beer, and the evil would be aggravated if the price of spirits were in fact lowered in consequence of the increased quantity available.      4,    With regard to wines,  it is desirable tc guard against  a possible  misapprehension as regards a plea in favour of the consumption of &quot;light&quot;  wines.   The alcoholic sftrength of most wines drunk in this  country is far above the alcoholic strength of beer,  and during the present scarcity there  is a danger that  women who are unable to obtain their usual supply of beer  might,  if wines were cheaper  and more plentiful, be driven into an in- jurious  habit of drinking port,  sherry and other strong wines.      5*    The Board cannot, therefore,  advise the removal of the existing restrictions upon the  delivery of such-wines from bond.  If, however, the  Government are  satisfied, having regard to  other  considerations,  that  some relaxa- tion should be  allowed,  and if they could introduce  safe- guards which  would  limit the relaxation to wines of comparatively low alcoholic strength,  the Board, in  the special  circumstances of the moment, would not desire  to offer objection to  the proposal.
