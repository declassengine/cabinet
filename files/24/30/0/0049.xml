rItalyof 21st. October 1917.             No.1442 4im&amp;fii \% fits property 0*347iiesty^ ocvernmeni.ITALY.I forward herewith three maps showing the disposi-tions of the Italian Second and Third Armies on the Isonzo frontas well as what is known of the Austrian Forces up to date,together with a table showing the organisation of the ItalianSecond and Third Armies .increasing insistence, the arrival of considerable German forcesat Laibach and about the Lines of Communications. The indicationsfurther go to show that the German forces are being directedtowards the Upper Isonzo, that is into the area north of Tolmino.Reports have been received of the appearance of German troopsabout the Wocheiner Lake and about Grahovo, east of Tolmino.The assumption is that the German troops are being kept fromcontact with the Italian Army until the moment for action.  TheGerman troops are said to be wearing Austrian uniform capsinstead of their own.   It is known, also, that the GermanArtillery and Trench Mortars have been considerably augmented.Other German technical troops have been reported and a few daysago the body of a German soldier, of the 3rd Battalion ofPioneers, was fished out of the Isonzo about Doblar.   The GermanAlpine troops in the Trentino are reported to be on their way to.the Isonzo front.  A considerable reinforcement of Germanaeroplanes has been received by the Austrians, the number beingstated to be about 200.   There are rumours current derived fromthe statements of prisoners that Bulgarian and Turkish troopsare also being brought up to reinforce the Austrian Army  butthese are probably rumours which the Austrians are circulatingto encourage the ir own troops.              One of the most significant indications  of  animpending offensive is the number of deserters who come overThe reports received recently indicate, with Jfrom
from the Austrian lines.   These deserters include a certainnumber of officers.   In some cases they are men who are averse,on racial or political grounds, from fighting with the Austrianforces, and in others they are merely men who wish to escapethe fighting which they know to bo in prospect.               There appears to be no doubt that the Germans andAustrians attach considerable importance to hopes that an out&quot;-break of internal troubles in Italy will coincide with thisintended offensive.   From various parts of the front messagesare shouted across the lines to the Italian troops to informthem that the war will soon be over as revolution has brokenout in Turin and elsewhere.               These hopes of the enemy are based on miscalcul--ations, but they have possibly so much foundation as may bedue to the groat efforts which German agents and sympathisershave been making, for some time past, to corrupt the patriotismof Italy.   The Germans, no doubt, have reports from theiragents in Italy that these efforts have been successful.               There appears reason to believe that therevolutionary organisation in Italy has been considerablydeveloped of late, and that the revolutionaries are evenpossessed of arms to a great extent.   But the Italian authorityies should have no difficulty in controlling the situation.The appointment of General Ragni to command the newly declaredWar Zone area round Turin, Alessandria and Genoa and theappointment of General Alfieri as food controller, are anexcellent augury for the future.   General Ragni will probablydeal very expeditiously with any attempts at disturbance, whileGeneral Alfieri, who was formerly Intendant-General of the Army,and is a very able officer, may bo relied upon to do all thatIs possible to prevent any trickery with the food supplies,which might be intended for the purpose of creating discontentand political trouble.               The Italians, on their side, have frequentlysent messages - printed and verbal - into the Austrian lines                                                      pointing
pointing out the advantages of surrender to the Italians *Captured Austrian orders show that the Austrian Command hasordered Straf feuer to be opened upon those sectors of the Italianfront from which these invitations are sent out.               The dispositions of the enemy- would appear toindicate an intention of making a strong effort against theItalian front about Tolmino and to the north of that place.All this area is very difficult and very ill-supplied withroads on the Austrian side, but in other respects it offersopportunities for the attacker which the Austrians or Germansmay desire to take advantage of.   At the present moment theamount of Italian troops and artillery is less in proportionhere than further south.    The defensive works have not been  *elaborated %o the same extent and, above all, if the enemy shouldsucceed in crossing the Isonzo and in gaining possession of theridge which runs on the right bank of the Isonzo, between theIsonzo and tho Natisone and which is marked by the hills calledMonte Matajur, Monte Cucco and Monte Kolovrat,- the situationwould be very serious for the Italian Army as all the lines ofcommunication further south would be directly threatened bya series of valleys formed by the affluents of the Natisoneand Judrio rivers.                To meet this threat from the north the ItalianCommand has at present the TVth. Corps, consisting of 3 divisions(5 brigades) and 13 additional battalions of Alpini.  Immediate-ly in rear of the IVth. Corps is the Vllth. Corps of 2 divisions(4 brigades and two additional regiments of Cersaglieri)  and theXXVIIIth. Corps with 3 divisions (8 brigades).  The position onthis flank therefore should bo reasonably secure.                The disadvantage of this part of the front fromthe Italian point of view is the angle it forms  and that,  owingto the steepness of the ground, movements of troops and ofvehicles can only take place by the roads which can be easilyreached by the enemyfs artillery.                \Ari enemy attack in strength from Tclmino  down the                                                          Isonzo
VuwmiMimmmBmamMiaLissmmmr&apos;-  r------ -.......----- -Isonzo valley would, if successful, threaten the bridges-overthe Isonzo and all the communications of the troops on theBainsizza Plateau.   The position of the Italian troops on thelatter to the north of the Avscek stream is not very happy;The advanced line at the present moment passes from just westof the Volnik, just west of the Vrh Souz, through Koprivsce,Mesnjak and Point 540 to Lob Dolenje.  In case of a very heavyoffensive on this portion of the front the Italian troopswould probably be withdrawn to a line running along the heightsextending from Point 800 (south-east of Madoni), through SantoSpirito, Levpa and the Veliki Vrh and Point 545.  The positionson the heights just west of this line are better for defenceand have been prepared as well as time has permitted.               The Italian artillery strength as far as numbersof guns is concerned is approximately the same as it was at thebeginning of the last Italian offensive.  The Second Army hasabout 1,300 heavy guns, 600 field guns, 250 mountain guns.The Third Army has about 800 heavy guns and 420 field guns.There are 14 French heavy batteries and 5 British heavy batteriesstill on the Italian front.   The Italian supply of TrenchMortars has been -increased since the last offensive.               The total ammunition available is about 1\ millionrounds of heavy artillery with the armies and ij millions asa reserve at the disposal of General Cadorna.               The enemy artillery has been notably increasedduring the last few weeks.  He has now a much larger number ofheavy pieces, of 12 inch and 15 inch calibres, with which he hasfired at many places in rear of the Italian lines.   Fragmentsof 13 cm and other typically German projectiles have been pickedup.   The Italian roads and lines of communication  are beingsystematically shelled.  It is reported that the enemy has atleast 1,000* more guns swa liable than in August.   His chiefconcentration of artillery appears to be about Tolmino and eastof Gorizia,  A large number of German Trench Mortars are reportedto be in the Plezzo basin, to which part German troops are saidto be going.  Deserters; report that the enemy intends to rely                                                         largely

It is most unfortunate that the weather duringthe last ten days has completely prevented air reconnaissancein that it has not been possible to watch  the few roadsavailable for the movements of the Austrian or German troops.               General Capello, upon whose Army it appearsprobable that the brunt of the enemy&apos;s attack will fall, isan alert and quick-witted commander.   He  has already madehis plans so as to hold a powerful manoeuvre force in readi-ness to counter-attack the enemy as soon as the latter iscommitted to the offensive.   Some of the  Corps Commandersin the Second Army are young and excellent generals.               On the front of the Third Army an attack isexpected which however will probably be demonstrative andintended to contain the Italian troops on  that portion of thefront, while the main Austro-German offensive is deliveredfrom the north.   The Italian General. Staff viewsthe prospectof an enemy attack with confidence and the army as a whole  isin good condition and morale, though perhaps not quite somuch so as at the beginning of the last offensive.   Itremains to be seen how the Italian troops  will stand up toa serious German attack.   It is certain that the moraleffect of a German attack will be much less now than it mighthave been in the early days of the war.   But the prestigeof the German Army has not entirely lost its effect on theItalians yet.               It is difficult to understand the motive ofthe Austrians in attempting a big offensive with forcesnumerically inferior at the present  time.    Whatever happensthe Austrian  forces, already much reduced, are certain tolose very heavily.   Again the direction of the thrust isperpendicular to the Italian main lines of communications andtherefore a big strategical success  is not likely to beachieved, even if the inferior Austrian forces were capable                                                       of
To9 s 9w ty (0a.of driving back the Italian Army,   consequently there maybe,more foundation than is yet known in the rumours of theapproach of German reinforcements, which General Cadornahas always considered possible.   If the enemy has reallya sufficient number of German divisions at his disposal tochange the situation his motive in making an offensive isquite plain.(Sd.)  C  Delme Radcliffe.
