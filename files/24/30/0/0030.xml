   ^5^^^^^^                   Government)*^fimJ^W   ^OOD PRODUCT I OH.                       232          Witli reference to the memorandum by Lord Milner(G.T.235.2),  I submit  the following observations: -          Scotland undertook by the end of 1918 to increase herarable acreage by 350,000 acre?! as compared with 1916.   The amountof increase  obtained  in 1917 was 50,000 acres.  In every county theExecutive Committees  in co-operation with the Board of  Agricul-ture are making strenuous efforts to obtain the balance of300,000 acres for 1918.  If this increase is accomplished thearable area  of Scotland will be within 2% of the  area in 1889.In that year the extent, of arable cultivation in Scotland wasthe greatest recorded in that  country.  The increased acreageobtained in  1917 represents almost entirely voluntary efforton the part  of Scottish farmers, who have been mueh handicappedby shortage  of labour.   Executive Committees only commenced workin the spring and early summer of this year,.and  the pressureexercised by them with  a view  to increased cultivation  will notproduce its  full result  until  1918.   The Hoard were able  to ob-tain 43 tractors for  spring cultivation in 1917,  but  the  iraper-fect  development of these machines considerably diminished thebenefits which were anticipated fro:.-, their use.   The Board have               tractorsnow obtained 107/more -  making 150 in all - and they hope toutilise a greater number as opportunity arises.   A TractorSchool has been established for training drivers,  a SupervisingEngineer with local assistants has been appointed,  and  avigorous tractor ploughing campaign  is  in operation.          The chief obstacle to the  execution  of the  cultivationProgramme is the lack of efficient labour.   A  large number  ofuseless men  were supplied  for  the  harvest work of  1917.   This not                                                          only
/only delayed the work hut  hod a discouraging  effect  upon theScottish formers, who view the prospect  of  cultivating  feh4 harvest-ing the 1910 crou with considerable  alarm.  A better and largersupply of soldier labour is essential if the  contemplated programmeis to be carried out.          Another serious  obstacle to increased  cultivation islack of superphosphate. This fertiliser is essential to the  produc-tion of large crops  of cereals on the class of land  now beingbrought under cultivation  in Scotland.   It  is also of great valuein shortening the ripening period -  a matter  of  considerableimportance under Scottish  climatic conditions.  The  PhosphateRock necessary for the manufacture of superphosphate, has to beimported.  During the months Hay to  August  inclusive of this  year,the total importation of phosphate rock  was only 67,411 tons  ascompared with 141,519 tons in 1916 and 206,854 tons  in  1915 forthe same period.  At  a conference of representatives of theDepartments of Agriculture on May 4th (War Cabinet G.T.650),  itwas agreed that 800,000 tons of rock phosphate t.r about  70,000tons per month must be imported to provide for the necessarysuperphosphate.  The  Importation per month has fallen far shortof that amount, and unless it  can be rapidly  increased,  the re-sults of the tillage  campaign in Scotland will be jeopardised.          A third obstacle is  the understaffed condition of theBoard of Agriculture.  Its st-ff has been largely deputed  bymilitary service while its work has  been enormously  increasedby war time conditions.  The staff urgently requires  augmentationboth in salary and in number.   I  represent strongly  to the WarCabinet that unless certain proposals which I have laid  beforethe Treasury for this purpose  are accepted, and  that timeously,it will not be possible  to guarantee the accomplishment  of theprogramme for increased  cultivation.                        (SD)  ROBERT MHRO.Scottish Office,  29th October, 1917.
