          THE EDUCATION BILL.                 * * * *With reference to Dr. Fisherfs report (G.T.2570)a minute (G.T.2594),  while I do not  presume jbb  ofieir ,any  observations with regard to the educational situation  in  England, I den Ire to state in a few sentences&quot;the position  in Scotland.           I can entirely confirm Mr. Barnes^ view that feel- ing in Scotland runs very strongly in favour of the introduc- tion  and passing of a Scotch Education Bill.  That feeling was evidenced at a meeting of over a thousand tes.chers which I addressed in Edinburgh during the vacation, at various depu- t at ions which I have received, and in iiwwitrf other influential quarters.           I have devoted a considerable amount of time recently, along with my advisers, to framing an Education Bill for Scot- land. That ?-ili is now substantially complete.  I propose in a week or  two to lay it before the -far Cabinet and to ask their authority  to  have at least a First Beading given to it before the end of the session.  The Bill would then be printed and circulated, end an opportunity would be afforded of &quot;collecting tting  the voices&quot; in Scotland with regard to its various provision           As  to the future progress of the Bill, I quite reeog- nise  that  that must depend upon Parliamentary developments which it  is impossible at present to foresee.  I venture to suggest, however, that the Bill might run pari passu with the English Eiucrtion  Bill, - a course which would give rise to no practical inconvenience, as in all probability the Scotch Bill would be referred to a Standing Committee.           There will be keen disappointment in Scotland if Engfcfc is  permitted  to have an Education Bill while Scotland is denied a similar  opportunity.                    (SIGHED) ROBERT MUIFRO . Scottish Office, &apos;    31st October, 1917.
