(This Document is the Property erf7His Britannic Majesty^ Government.380C;1xPMPffAinDUM FgR JHE WAR CABINET./S     I observe that the Secretary cf State for Forlign Affairs-proposes to appoint a Committee to review the whole question offood supplies to iur Allies and to ourselves.  The gravity of thequestion cannot be too seriously considered, but if it is decidedto appoint an additional Committee I venture to press upon theCabinet that the supplies of oil cannot be excluded from the review.       The Prime linister stated the other day in the course of adiscussion that food supplies cannot be considered alone, but must03 considered as part of the whole.  In my opinion it is impossibletc exaggerate the importance of this statement.  The supply offoodstuffs is, of course, of vital importance.   So far as the UnitedKingdom is concerned I am satisfied that what is really needed ismuch more drastic econsmy in consumption:  but  be that as it may,  itis undoubtedly the fact that whatever may be our supplies of men,munitions or food, everything is dependent upon our supply of oil.Without oil the Navy cannot move,  supplies cannot be conveyed to ourtroops, and cur whole industrial output cannot  be maintained.  It istherefore essential tc the successful prosecution of the war that theposition of our oil supplies should be considered simultaneously withthe investigation of other problems.       May I remind the Cabinet that last week  I  warned them that  theshortage of oil is very serious.  Since I assumed control I  haveconsiderably increased the supplies in this country,  but the marginis still perilously small.  It is  all a question of  tonnage,  and inmy judgment satisfactory results can only be secured by all  theseproblems being considered together.W.H.L.31.X.17.
