Government )           MUNITIONS POSSIBILITIES  OF 1918.    1. IN deciding upon the Munitions Programme for1918, the first question  to  be  answered is, &quot; What isthe War Plan 1  When is it to reach its climax.?&quot;  Havewe the possibility of winning in 1918, and if so, how arewe going to do it ?    Two  alternatives  immediately  present  themselves(a) to try to beat and  break up the German armies inthe West so that they are no longer able to offer effectiveresistance; or  (6) to stand on an active defensive in theWest until 1919, when the American armies should havebecome a decisive factor,  and meanwhile to attack andendeavour  to  crush  or square Turkey, Bulgaria, andAustria.   There  is much  to be said for either of theseplans ; there is nothing to be said for weak compromisesbetween  the  two.   The  character of  our MunitionsProgramme  and  the  use we should make  of our man-power, largely depend upon   the  decision,   and  thesooner it is  taken, the easier it will be to make goodarrangements.    2. It is obvious that  the defeat and breaking-up ofthe  German armies  in the  West affords  the  best, thesimplest and the swiftest method of arriving at decisivevictory,  The  only question is, &quot; Have we the powerto do it ?&quot;   It would be a thousand pities to discardthis, direct  and  obvious method of victory in favourof weaker, more roundabout,  protracted  and  far lessdecisive strategy unless we are  convinced  that we havenot the power to conquer on  the Western Front.   Itwould be equally wrong to go  on  punching away in theWest,  consuming  our resources in men  and  materialand meanwhile  neglecting  all opportunities  in  othertheatres  without the  conviction  that  decisive victorycan  and  will  be  secured.  This is the same  questionwhich has presented itself in the autumns of 1914,  1915,and 1916, and  which  we have either answered  wronglyor not answered  at  all.  To answer it now with anyprospect  of  being right it is necessary to survey thewhole of our resources in comparison with  those of theenemy.   The argument of this paper is therefore directedsolely to the question  of whether we have the means  ofoverthrowing finally  the enemy&apos;s main armies on theWestern Front during the campaign of 1918.    3. We have hoped to do this  every year since thebeginning of the war, and  have received the most con-fideut assurances from all the highest military authorities.Ever since the  autumn of 1914 we have  heard the  sameaccounts of the exhaustion of the enemy&apos;s man-power, ofthe decline of his moral, and of how near  we  stand, ifwe only make the effort, to the  supreme  and final result.Every year we have  in consequence made  exertions onthe greatest  possible  scale, and  every year  the close  ofthe campaign has seen the enemy&apos;s front, however dinted,yet unbroken.  But this in itself is by no means con-clusive; for  the  effects of our efforts  upon the enemyhave been cumulative, the exhaustion of his man-powerand the deterioration of his moral have been progressive,our superiority in munitions of all kinds has continually     [1007-3]                                B
  augmented;  the offensive power of the British army has  continually increased;   that  of  the   French  is  still  formidable.  The German  armies in the West, on the  other  hand, appear  to have  completely  lost,  their  offensive power.  The Germans have now been for four  campaigns extended to their maximum war effort.   They  have maintained in continual battle upon all fronts armies  of four or  five  millions  of. men.  The very efficiency  of  their  organisation  enabled them to  strain  themselves  to their fullest  compass  from  the outset, and  the  draft  which  they have made  upon  the life energies of  their  whole  nation is proportionately equal to and possibly  greater than the draft which  has been made  upon the  life-energies of  France.   We can measure the effect  of  the strain upon the French ; and this affords perhaps the  best guide to the  actual remaining fighting  power  of  Germany.  Therefore it may  well  be  that  conclusions  drawn  from  our   disappointments  in  four  successive  campaigns  would  not apply to the fifth, and that the  assertions and hopes that have proved unjustified in four  successive  campaigns might be vindicated in  the  end..  For  this reason it is imperative  not to abandon the  Western effort  and resign ourselves to the  formidable  dangers involved in the  prolongation  of  the  war into  1919, without the most searching consideration  of all our resources.    4. If we are to conquer in the West we must for that purpose provide for the concentration of all our methods of attack upon the enemy simultaneously afc the decisive period.  This does not by any means imply the abandon- ment still less the  abandonment  in  failure of  our efforts  in other theatres.   It does involve,  however, the clear selection of a  culminating point  or period up to which everything shall l^ad, to&apos; which everything must be preparatory,  ancillary, and subordinate. It  demands a sure and  effective method  of  the  offensive  and  a definite time-table  governing  the  whole of our  War Plan..    5. Success can  only  be  achieved by the  scale  and intensity of our offensive effort within  a limited period. We are seeking to conquer the enemy&apos;s army  and not his position;  and  one stroke  must follow another so rapidly that no breathing space for recovery or recupera- tion  is afforded.   Unless  the effort  reaches and is maintained  at the   required degree of intensity or on a sufficiently large scale  the campaign will be. indecisive like  all the others, however successful  and  profitable individual  battles may have been.  It is this principle of the intensity of the effort during a culminating period which must govern all our calculations.   With armies so large as those  which   confront  each  other  in  the West,  and  with  numerical superiority  on  our   side- which cannot be large,, and  may  well  be non-existent,. a &quot;Succession  of  heavy   blows  at  intervals  during the   campaigning  season  may,,  however  successful,. result only m reciprocal losses without  substantially altering the  strategic situation.    A  policy  of pure- attrition between armies  so evenly balanced cannot lead to a decision.  It is not a  question of wearing  down  the enemy&apos;s reserves, but of wearing them down so rapidly that recovery and replacement  of  shattered divisions is.impossible.   In a struggle between,  say, 250 divisions.on one  side and 200 on the  other, the  small mai-gin ofsuperiority possessed by the stronger  cannot be made to
tell decisively before the winter respite is reached unlessthe war effort  of the  offensive  reaches  a far higherdegree of general intensity than has hitherto been foundpossible.  In  other words, our attack must be of sucha  character  that a division  once us^d  up  on  eitherside cannot  reach the  battle front again during theculminating period in  time to influence the conclusion.Unless this problem can  be solved  satisfactorily we shallsimply be wearing each other out on  a gigantic scaleand  with fearful  sacrifices, without  ever  reaping thereward.   6. It is clear that in 1918 we cannot hope for anylarge numerical superiority in men.  The relief  whichwill  be  afforded even on the most  favourable assumptionto the German armies in the West by the collapse ofRussia must be  set against  the reinforcement  we shallreceive from the United  States.  I have witnessed withprofound disappointment the slow and frugal developmentof American fighting strength in France.  From the day-when America entered the war, the stream of Americanmanhood, trained, half-trained, or untrained, to Europeshould have been continuous, and all the available meansof transportation  should  have been assembled and con-tinually  used to  their  utmost   capacity   the  men,of  course,  being  properly  trained   either   on  oneside  of  the  Atlantic  or  the  other.   The melancholydecision to adopt a different form  of armament, both forthe infantry and artillery, has also seriously retarded thedevelopment of American war power.  This is now beingrealised by the American authorities, but too late.   Wecannot,  therefore, count on  any  gi*eat  superiority innumbers on  the Western Front in  1918.   Our calcula-tions must proceed upon  an  assumption that there willbe no decisive preponderance in the number  of formeddivisions or  in  the number  of men in  the  line or inthe reserves available within the year.  We are, however,entitled to count  upon  a  marked and possibly increasingsuperiority in quality  and  moral.   There remain, inaddition, only the great  province of war machinery andthe resources  of  supeiior generalship operating throughwar machinery.   Wiil  these suffice ?   7. There  are  six  principal forms of  machinery bywhich  our infantry on  the  Western  Front  (slightlysuperior  in numbers, markedly superior in qualityj maybe aided, viz.:          Artillery preponderance,         Air supremacy,         Railway or mechanical mobility,         Trench mortar development,         Tank development,         Gas development.   In what way can these be  combined and applied bygeneralship so as to produce  the  maximum intensity ofoffensive power during the culminating period ?  Secondly,what distribution of the  limited resources at the disposalof the Ministry of Munitions is best calculated to yieldthe maximum development and  the  highest economy ofresultant war power  in  harmony  with  the War Plan ?These questions will now be examined.                         n.  -   8. During the Somme offensive the British artilleryfired an average of 26,000 tons of. shell a week.  During
      the twenty-two weeks of  the  present  offensive  the      average has been 47,000.   If the programmes on which      we are now working are executed, the average weight of      shell  per  week available  during the whole of the  1918      offensive should rise to approximately 6G,000 tons.   Both      the guns  and ammunition on that scale  are being pro-      vided.  This figure, however, constitutes  our maximum.      The  magnitude of the effort should not  be underrated.      Steel is the  limiting factor,  and,- having  regard  to      increased  shipbuilding demands and declining tonnage of      imported ore, no further expansion can be  expected.         On the contrary, attention is drawn to  the fact that, if      there is  a  1919 campaign, the  drain  which  wre are    -  planning to put on  our  stocks  of shell (especially theX^Zv  heavier Bftww-febiss)  to meet  the 1918  programme will      result in a smaller firing rate (except for 6-inch howitzers)      during the summer months of 1919.         9. On  the  other hand, we have not yet  reached the      limits  of  our  High  Explosive  supply.   Many of  our      factories have been working short time,  and others are      almost closed down.  Our capacity for manufacturing High      Explosives considerably exceeds our present  means of      discharging it  upon the enemy through  the  agency of      steel guns and shells.   If  therefore we are to realise our      full  potentiality,  we should  develop other  additional      methods of discharging High Explosive upon the enemy.         10. T WO lii ethods readily suggest themselves.  The      first is by  aeroplane bomb.  This will be dealt wdth in its      place.   But the second,  and far the  most  important      method, can be found in an  extensive development of      trench mortars.  This would be po-sibk\ within limits      w-hich are being accurately ascertained, without making      inroads upon our limited  supplies of steel, or competing      seriously  with other  important supplies.   Thus a new      and additional method of making war  on the  enemy      w^ould be created.         11. In order that this proposition may be fairly judged,      it is necessarv to consider it in its true tactical relation.      Trench  mortars  have not played an  important  part      hitherto in our operations.  Except in the  opening stages      of a  great offensive,  it has been found impossible to use      them.   Once the ground  has been torn up by the bom-      bardment  and the  troops have advanced  on  to  the      battlefield, it is not physically possible to&apos; carry  up into      close proximity to the firing-line the masses of ammunition      which they require,  especially when the enemy is  firing      ceaselessly upon the communications with his concentrated      artillery.   On  the  main  battle-front, therefore, or on      ground where the rival artilleries are concenti-ated, trench      mortars are relegated to a subsidiary part.           12. But none of these difficulties hamper the em-      ployment  of trench mortars on a scale many times greater      than has yet been practised provided they are used not      on the main battleneld but on other and quieter parts of      the front.   One or more sectors of the front each fifteen      or twenty miles long can be chosen in advance and loaded      up  with  large stores  of trench-mortar  ammunition      wdiich can be carried up during quiet periods for those      sectors and safely stored without imposing undue labour      on the troops holding the line, and without and this is      the important point revealing any trace to the aeroplane      photograph.   The  mortars themselves are very easy to      make  and to  establish,   and owing to  their extreme      rapidity of fire the numbers required are not excessive.
 The manufacture of the mortars and  of the ammunition sufficient for a series of very considerable operations could be  prepared  without  encroaching  upon  our steel  or sensibly  affecting  artillery or other  programmes.   Tn this way the  Ministry of Munitions  would be able  to utilise the full limit of their . explosive capacity and the trench-mortar  armament would come as a  clear addition to the offensive power of the army.     13. The range of the mortar is  already more than 1,000  and will it  is  believed soon  be raised to about 1,500 yards.   Even greater ranges are confidently hoped for.   Thus if 40 to 50 miles of our Front were systema- tically prepared with this trench mortar installation, it would be possible during  the  culminating  period and  at the  true psychological  moment in  relation to the main battle,  to pulverise and  rip away  the  whole of the enemy&apos;s  first  system  of trenches  simultaneously   or successively  over  very  considerable   stretches  of the Front.   On  *these  quiet sectors of the Front the enemy has  few troops and&apos; no  concentration of artillery.  It is possible even  that because  he is weak he maintains  in the  first system a larger proportion of such troops as he has  on the ground  than is now his  habit on the actual battle-front.   Such  troops as he has  there  are resting and recovering from the ordeal of the main battle.  The well-recognised symptoms which  indicate the preparation of an  offensive, viz., the massing of guns, the  develop- ment of railways, the digging of assembly trenches, &amp;c,. would all be lacking.  The priceless element of surprise might therefore  be secured.  No great superiority   of infantry would be  required to yield  the  moderate and limited  results which  are  to  be expected&apos; from this subsidiary method of attack.   On  the other hand, the bombardment  on a  great  scale by trench mortars firing heavy bombs is certainly not less formidable so far  as the  rano-e allows than  even  the most severe  artiherv attacks.   If  it is thought worth while to cultivate this addition  to  our  offensive  power,  estimates   will  be furnished by the Ministry  of Munitions  showing the the  full scale on which trench mortars and ammunition could be provided.  It would, however, he indispensable to the efficient execution of any of these schemes that the  trench-mortar  service  should  be organised  as  a special  branch, and  that it  should receive its  due pro- portion of the best officers and men.    14.  We have, in fact, to contemplate the simultaneous&apos; or successive concerted fighting of two different kinds of battles involving in their  aggregate  all the  practicable portions of the front.  There is the main battle or battle of Exhaustion, and  the subsidiary battle or  battle  of Surprise.   They mutually aid each other, and  it might well be  that the results  of the battle of Exhaustion would be reaped on the battlefield of Surprise.  The battleof exhaustion is appropriate to ground which the enemy cannot  afford to give up, of  which  he has  to contestevery yard.   The battles  of surprise are appropriate tothe less  strategically significant portions  of the front.The  battle of exhaustion should proceed as at presentby  regular  steps  from  the earliest period of the cam-paigning season until the culminating period is  reached.The  battles  of surprise should  then  be  successivelyreleased  until the whole front, now at  one point now atanother,  is involved.  The methods of the  battles ofsurprise  should be  wholly different from those  of the     [1007-3]            &apos;                       C
 battle of exhaustion.   The material required should as far as possible not compete with the needs of the main battle.  Above all the preparation should not  reveal the conventional  symptoms  of  an  offensive  to  a  hostile aeroplane  photograph.  It is  believed  that botli these conditions can be&apos;satisfied.                          III.    15. There are other means  besides trench mortars for delivering the battle or battles of surprise.   The original conception of the Tanks was to use them (a) by night, (6) by surprise, (c) as a novelty, (d) as an independent arm, (e) in an operation specially planned for them under the most favourable weather conditions, and (f) on ground not torn up by artillery.  The comparatively small numbers that have been so  far available, the  imperfections of their design, the urgent needs  of the  army,  have  led to an almost complete reversal of all  these conditions.  Tanks have been  condemned  to wallow  in twos and threes in broad daylight in the most astounding crater fields,  con- fronted by the enemy&apos;s massed  artillery,  and where every special preparation has been made to receive them.  Even so  they have  played their part.  But  the resources of next year will for the first time make available numbers of Tanks with trained personnel sufficient not only to act as auxiliaries  to the infantry in the main  battle,  but  to provide  the  forces  necessary  for attacks  of their  own under the most favourable conditions and on a  very large scale.  While the existing pattern of Tanks will be avail- able  in  considerable  numbers  to support  the  main operations of  the army  during  the spring  and early summer, it should be possible by July to provide an ample force  of a  greatly improved  pattern, lighter, faster, and with far greater radius of action.   It will not be  necessary,  as with  the present types, to bring these Tanks up  in   close  proximity to  the  battlefield  some days before the attack.   They can be held back along an  arc 15  to 20 miles from the  centre  of  attack, and concentrated for battle by complete surprise. There is no need to elaborate these possibilities.  At  present, how- ever, only 18,000  men are assigned for the Tank  Corps. This  imposes  severe limitations on this method of  multi- plying infantry men.    10. The third factor which could be made to play its part in the battles of Surprise is Railway Artillery.   The French have made a  very great  development of this, using for the purpose all kinds  of long-range guns,  old  and modern,  taken from  their Navy and their fortresses and mounted on many kinds  of carriages,  from  the  most- complex  to the most primitive.   The total number of guns of all kinds employed by the  French in this special service amounts to not fewer than 1,100, and next year it is contemplated to raise the number to 1,800.   Approxi- mately two-thirds of  these  guns fire  from railway mountings, and the  rest  are moved by tractors.  The method in contemplation is to construct in four or five, or even  more, selected sectors of the front the  necessary sidings from which the railway guns can  be brought into action.  Thus,  even  if the enemy notices these prepara-tions beforehand, he has no means of knowing at anygiven moment which of the four or five points  of attackis going to be used.  He could  be  further mystified&apos;by acamouflage preparation of additional points of attack.
It should thus be possible to secure for the heavy artillery,or at least  an  important portion  of it,  that mobilityfrom one part of the front  to another which is essentialto surprise.   The French general  who  commands thisservice (&quot; Artillerie lourde de grande Puissance &quot;).statesthat with good arrangements,  well thought  out andprepared  during the winter, it  should  be possible  tobring into action in  a single  night 300  or 400  powerfullong-range guns in a sector where previously the enemyhad no reason to expect an attack.    17. The relation  of this method to the other factorsavailable for  Surprise battles is obvious.   If preparationswere begun now and  continued throughout, the winter, theBritish  Front might be equipped not only with trench-mortar installations  covering wide  sectors, but also withthe railway facilities and  railway  artillery necessary toenable a  heavy artillery to intervene in  battles of Sur-prise in several alternative or successive points of attack.The  possibilities so  far as  materials are  concerned arebeing thoroughly examined in the Ministry of Munitions.Simplified  forms   of  mountings   of  various  kinds,including  a   new  &quot;semi-mobile&quot;  pattern,  are  beingdesigned. If, as we have been led to believe, the manningrequirements  of the Navy for their new program me. foranti-submarine craft of all kinds should necessitate duringnext year the laying up of larger numbers of older battle-ships, it is possible that a considerable supply of guns mightbe obtained from this source. t  Many of our fortresses athome and abroad also contain guns which are not  likelyto be required  which could now be safely spared for amore urgent  service.  It ought to be possible without anundue strain on either our labour or material to developby next  summer a  very  considerable force of  mobileand  semi-mobile (i.e., requiring  a concrete bed) heavyartillery together with a series of &quot;jumping-off grounds &quot;from which it could act as required.   18. Thus  our front might during the wdnter be syste-matically prepared  both with the  properly protectedstores  of trench-mortar  ammunition and  the railwayfacilities for the long-range artillery which would enablethe Gommander-in-Chief to move powerful trench-mortarand  heavy artillery  organisations from sector to sectorwith great rapidity and  ease and  open up a  series ofSurprise battles ail  along the front at the  psychologicalmoment  of, or in the necessary interludes between, thegreat attacks on the main battle-front.   There are, ofcourse, many other factors  in connection  with  the swiftmovement of troops  laterally or from points in rear toparticular sectors of attack;  but these fall outside  thescope of a paper written solely from the point of view ofmunitions..   It  may, however, be mentioned that a verylarge reserve of mechanical transport manufactured forEussia, but not now required for that purpose, is avail-able and idle.   If, however, our Army next year found itself endowedwith the  power at four or  five  different points (a)  topulverise  the enemy&apos;s front  system up to a depth  of1,500 yards with trench  mortars, and (6)  simultaneouslyto bring  a greatly  superior heavy  long-range  artilleryinto  action  both by complete surprise  and at  periods&apos;accurately related to the main operation, it would possessthe means of  sensibly extending the scope and enhancingthe intensity of its offensive action.
     19.  Most  important  of  all  the  mechanical factors which are available, comes the Air Offensive.   So much progress in  thought  has been  made on  this subject, even since this paper was under preparation, that it is not necessary to dwell upon it at any length.   But there are  certain general principles  which  may be stated or re-stated.     War proceeds by slaughter and manoeuvre.  Manoeuvre consists either in operations of Surprise or in operations against the  flanks and communications  of the enemy. Owing  to the lines now stretching continuously from the Alps to the sea, there are no flanks.  But the Germans, striking under the sea at our vital communications, have threatened us with a decisive peril, which  we are warding off only by an immense diversion of our resources.  If we take, on the one hand, the amount of national life-energy which the Germans have put into their submarine attack and compare it with the amount of national life-energy we are compelled to devote to meeting and overcoming- that attack, it will be apparent  what a  fearfully profit- able  operation this attack  on  our  communications  has been to the enemy.   Would it be an exaggeration to say that for one.war-power unit Germany has applied to the submarine attack we have been forced to assign fifteen or twenty ?     Even  better  than an operation against communica- tions is an operation against  bases.  Air predominance affords the  possibility  of   striking at  both.   It  can either  paralyse the  enemVs  military  action  or compel him to devote to the defence of his  bases  and communi- cations a share of his straitened resources far greater than what we need in the attack.     20. All attacks on communications or bases  should have their relation to the main  battle.  It is not reason- able to speak of a.n air  offensive as if it were going to finish  the  war  by itself.  It  is improbable that  any termrisation  of  the  civil  population which could  be achieved by  air a(tack would  compel the Government of a great nation to surrender.   Familiarity with bom bard- men t,  a good system of dug-outs or shelters, a  strong control by police  and  military  authorities, should  be sufficient to preserve the national fighting power unim- paiied.  In  our  own case  we have seen the combative spirit of  the  people  roused,  and not quelled, by  the German air raids.  Nothing that we have learned of the capacity of the German  population to -endure suffering justifies us in assuming  that they could be  cowed into submission by such methods, or,  indeed, that they would not be rendered more  desperately  resolved  by them. Therefore our air offensive should consistently be directed at  striking at the bases and communications upon whose structure the fighting power of his armies and his fleets of  the  sea and of the air  depends.   Any injury which comes to the civil population from this process of attack must be regarded as incidental and inevitable.     21. The supreme and direct object of an air offensive- is to deprive the  German armies on the Western Front of their  capacity  for  resistance.   It  must therefore  be applied and reach  its maximum development in  proper relation to the  main  battles  both of Exhaustion  and Surprise during  the culminating period  of our general
offensive.   German armies whose communications werecontinually  impeded  and interrupted and  whose  baseswere unceasingly harried might still, in spite of all thatcould be done from the air, be able to maintain themselvesin the field and keep the front.  But if at the same timethat this great  difficulty and menace to &quot;their services inrear had reached its maximum,  they were also subjectedto the intense  strain of a great offensive on the groundproceeditig by battles both of Exhaustion and  Surprise,the complete defeat and breaking  up of their armies inthe West  as a whole might not  perhaps be beyond  thebounds  of possibility.  There is an immense  differencebetween merely keeping an army fed and supplied on acomparatively quiescent front in spite of air attacks, andresisting the kind of offensive which the  British  aredelivering at the present time.   It is imperative that  thedefending  army  should be  able  to move  hundreds ofthousands of tons of stores  and ammunition within verylimited  times to the battle front and to maintain a mostrapid circulation of  hundreds of thousands  of troops;and the double  strain  of doing this  under a really over-whelming  air  attack  might  well  prove  fatal.   Moreespecially  might this be hoped for if  the form of  ouroffensive were  not  confined  simply to  the  main battle-front, but if it  were so varied in locality and direction asto require from the enemy an exceptional degree of lateralmobility.   For  our air offensive to attain its full effect itis necessary that our  ground offensive should be of acharacter to throw the greatest possible strain upon  theenemy&apos;s communications.    22.  We have greatly suffered and are  still sufferingin  the  progress of our means  of air warfare from  theabsence of a proper General Staff studying the possibilitiesof air warfare,  not merely  as an ancillary service  to  thespecial operations of the Army or the Navy, but also as anindependent arm  co-operating  in  the general  plan.Material developments  must necessarily be  misguided solonff as they do not relate to a definite War Plan for theAir, which again is combined with the general War Plan.&apos;]    23.  In  consequence  of this many  very  importantpoints are still  in doubt or in dispute, on which systema-tised Staff study could have by now given  clear pro-.nouncements.  The dominating and immediate interestsof the army and the navy  have overlaid air warfare andprevented many&apos; promising lines  of investigation frombeing pursued  with the necessary science and  authority.Extreme diversities of  opinion prevail as to  the degreeof effectiveness which can be expected from  aerial attack.It is disputed whether air attack can ever really shattercommunications, bases,  or  aerodromes.  It  is  contendedthat aerodromes are  difficult  to discover and  still moredifficult to hit; that  tons of bombs have been dischargedon  particular aerodromes without denying  their use tothe enemy j that railway junctions  and communicationshave been repeatedly bombed without preventing  appre-ciably the  immense  and continuous movement of menand material necessary  to the fighting armies; that nobombardment from the  air, especially at great distancesfrom bur  Own lines, can compare  in  intensity with  thekind of bombardment from artillery, in spite of whichnevertheless, operations of a  military and even  semi-military character are continuously carried on.    On  the other hand, it is claimed that aerial warfarehas never yet been practised except in  miniature ; that    ; [1007-3]                                 D
bombing  in particular  has  never  been studied  as ascience; that the hitting of objectives from great heightsby day or night is worthy of as intense a volume of scientificstudy as, for instance, is brought to bear upon perfectingthe gunnery of the Fleet; that much of the unfavourabledata  accumulated showing the comparative  ineffective-ness of bombing consists of results of unscientific action for instance,  dropping  bombs  singly without  propersighting apparatus or specially trained &quot; bomb droppers &quot;(the equivalent of &quot; gun layers &quot;), instead  of droppingthem in regulated salvos by specially trained men, so asto &quot;straddle&quot; the  targets  property.   It is  believed  bythe sanguine school that a very high degree of accuracy,similar to  that which has been  attained at  sea underextraordinarily difficult circumstances, could be achievedif something  like  the same scientific knowledge  andintense determination- were brought to bear.   Secondly, it is pointed out  that an air offensive hasnever  been considered on the  same  scale or with  thesame ruthlessness in regard to losses for adequate objectsas prevail in the operations of armies.  Aeroplanes havenever been used  to attack  vital objectives in  the samespirit as infantry have been used, viz., regardless of loss,the attack  being repeated again  and again  until  theobjective is secured.    It is  pointed out that in 1918numbers will, for the  first  time,  become  available foroperations, not merely on the larger scale, but of a totallydifferent character.   24. On  the assumption  that  these  more  sanguineviews  are justly founded, the  primary objective  of ourair forces become plainly apparent, viz., the  air bases ofthe enemy and  the  consequent  destruction of his airfighting forces.  All other objectives, however tempting,however necessary it  may  be to  make provision  forattacking some of them, must be regarded as subordinateto this primary purpose.  If, for instance, our  numericalsuperiority in  the air  were sufficient  at a certain periodnext year to enable us in the space of two or three weeksto sacrifice  2,000  or  3,000 aeroplaues, their pilots beingeither killed or captured, in locating and destroying bybomb and fire, either from a great height or if necessaryfrom  quite  low  down,  all  or nearly all  the enemy&apos;shangars, and making unusable all or nearly all his landinggrounds and starting  grounds within  50 or  60 miles ofhis front line, his air  forces might be  definitely beaten,and once beaten could be kept beaten.   Once this result was achieved and real mastery oftheair obtained, all sorts of enterprises which  are now notpossible  would become  easy.   All  kinds of aeroplaneswhich it is not now possible to use on the fighting frontscould come  into play.  Considerable parties  of soldierscould be conveyed by air to the neighbourhood of bridgesor other  important points, and, having  overwhelmed  the&quot;local guard, could from the ground  effect a  regular andpermanent demolition.   The destruction  of  particularimportant factories would also  be achieved by  carefullyorganised expeditions of this kind.  &quot; Flying columns &quot;(literally) of this character could be organised to operatefar and wide in the enemy&apos;s.territory,  thus forcing himto disperse in an indefinite defensive good troops urgentlyneeded at  the front.  Ail his  camps,  depots, &amp;c.,-couldbe made the object  of constant organised  machine-gunattack from low-flying squadrons.   But the indispensablepreliminary to all results in  the air, as in  every other
sphere of  war,  is  to. defeat the  armed forces  of theenemy.  &apos; &quot; V/&apos;         f&apos;&quot;&apos;   &apos;V.  ,  &apos;    &apos;  &apos;   &apos;   ; &apos;    &apos;,   25. It should  not be supposed  that victory  in theWest depends  indispensably  on a  large superiority innumbers.   When  one army, partly from superiority innumbers,  partly from superiority in morale, feels itselfdecidedly the stronger, it seeks to assume the offensive.What is lacking is an effective  method of the offensive.A very large superiority  in  numbers wouL I of course beone way, but we have no prospect of getting this.   Threeor four times the artillery we have  at  present would beanother method ; but there is no prospect of getting thisin the immediate future.  Still, if a means could be foundwhereby  the  stronger and  better  army could advancecontinuously and at a sufficient speed on a front of twentyor thirty miles, a general retirement would unquestionablybe forced upon the German armies.    26. How, then, are  we  to  find  this method of  con-tinuous  offensive,  which  is&apos; the inherent right  of thestronger  and better army, and the absence of which  isthe sole cause of the prolongation of the war ?  We haveat present  only the artillery.   If  you concentrate thebulk of the artillery of a great nation on a narrow battlefront and feed it with the whole industry of the people,it is possible to pound  and pulverise certain areas  ofground, so that a limited advance can certainly be made.But  the  artillery is so local in its action, so costly in itsuse, and so ponderous in its movement that the  rate ofthe advance has not hitherto led to.any decsive strategicresults.   It is clear, therefore, that  the artillery alone isnot  sufficient, and will  never be sufficient, to impart  tothe  stronger  army the certain and irresistible  means ofadvancing which  it requires.  It is becoming apparentthat the &quot;blasting power&quot; of the artillery is only one of the  factors required for a satisfactory method  of the offensive.   &quot; Moving power &apos;.&apos; must  be  developed equally with &quot;blasting power.&quot;   &quot;Moving power&quot;  deserves  as sustained a study, as extensive an application,  and  as large a share of our resources as have hitherto been given to the &quot; blasting power &quot; of the artillery.    &quot;Moving power,&apos;&apos; in the  shape of railways,  motor transport,  light railways  and  tramways,  has  already attained  large  dimensions  up to the edge of the battle- field ; but &quot; moving power&quot;  on the battlefield  itself is practically limited  to  the arms  and legs of  human beings.   This is not enough, and it  never will be enough, and  until it  can  be supplemented  on the battlefield by machinery of one kind or another which can be  brought into being and kept in working  order in spite of intense battle conditions,  the stronger  army will remain robbed of its method of advance.    27. It was therefore proposed in November last year that every infantry battalion engaged in  an offensive should be provided with two caterpillar tenders which would undoubtedly carry over the battlefield during the day  of battle, and the  night  following, all  the  supplies necessary for the  immediate continued action  of the infantry.   The Army have now&apos; asked us since  July of this year for 4oO of th&apos;ese supply tanks by the 1st March, 1918.  A serious  delay in meeting this requirement is now inevitable, but that it can be met, and met  on a      [1007-3]                                  E
very large scale, during the course of next year is certain.A satisfactory  universal  carrying-machine  has  beendesigned and will  be reproduced as rapidly as possible.This machine will carry over the &quot; cratered&quot; battlefield10 tons, which by making certain fittings can either beexpressed in guns, men, ammunition, or supplies.   Othermethods of utilising the existing tanks to draw sledgesof supplies are also being developed.   28. Another method which is now being pursued pro-misingly, and  may be found to be capable of applicationon a very large scale, is &quot; rope railways &quot; or &quot; cableways.&quot;Various systems of this have recently been experimentedwith and constructed by  the army  and by  the Ministryof Munitions, working simultaneously and independent!)&apos;&quot;.This work has now been combined, and it may be foundpossible within a reasonable time to support; the forwardmovement of an army by a net-work of cableways, whichwill grow  up as fast as  the troops can move across thebattlefield, and can with  sufficient loss and effort  bemaintained in  working  order during  the battle and inthe night following.   The relative merits  of the  &quot;caterpillar tender&quot; or&quot; supply tank &quot; compared  to the cableway have  yet tobe determined.  It seems not at all improbable that bothwill be needed,  and that the  supply of the fightinginfantry in the most advanced positions could be  main-tained  by the  caterpillars,  while  the supply  of theadvancing batteries would be secured by the cableways.    29.  If we  may assume a stronger and  better armyequally equipped with &quot;blasting power&quot; and &quot;&quot;movingpower,&quot; and capable of operating continuously on a frontsufficiently broad,  its success  would  not necessarily  bedependent upon the relative numbers of troops availableon either side  in the whole theatre of war.  Whateverhis strength in other parts, the enemy would be under acontinual imperative obligation of arresting this offensivemovement on  a given  front.   Someone must stop thetiger.   If the rate of advance was sufficiently rapid, lackof a great superiority in numbers would not paralyse theattackers;  and even bringing superior numbers to thespot would not help the defenders.  For the defensive,even more than for the offensive,  the numbers of menwhich   can  be usefully employed in  given areas ofground is severely limited.  Just as it may be said thatthe  &quot;intensity&quot; of the offensive all along the frontshould be such as to make the whole line rock and keepthe enemy in  continual  movement and uncertainty,  sothe rate of progress  of the attack on the main battlefieldand the obstruction of communications  behind it shouldbe sufficient to prevent reinforcement before essentialpoints are lost.    30.  When  we see these great armies in the  &apos; Westspread  out in  thin  lines hundreds of miles  long andorganised in depth only at very few points, it is impossibleto  doubt that if  one  side  discovered, developed, andperfected a definite  method of advancing continuously,albeit  upon  a fairly  limited  front,  a, decisive  defeatwould be inflicted upon the  other.   If, therefore, wecould by organised mechanical processes and  equipmentimpart this faculty to our armies in 1918 or in 1919,  itwould be an  effective substitute for a great numericalpreponderance in numbers.  What other substitute canwe look  for?  Where else  is  our superioritv comingirom t
VI. ;   31. A survey of these mechanical possibilities together with  a  computation of bur resources compared to those of the enemy should  afford the best means  of judging the fateful question  already postulated, viz., whether we have  the means of overthrowing  finally  the enemy&apos;s main  armies on  the  Western Front during the campaign of  1918.   If.  it is  decided to  answer this  question affirmatively,  certain  very  important  consequential decisions should be taken.  We must  contemplate the campaign of 1918 in France as  the  supreme  climax  of our military effort on the Western Front, and we must back  that  effort with every scrap of strength  we can scrape together.  We must be prepared  to  give an over- riding priority to every service or project which  can be made to play an effective part in  the main struggle. The only deductions of force which  can  be allowed are those which are necessary  for  our defensive security at home and  for the maintenance  of our sea communica- tions, or those which are imposed upon us in  subsidiary theatres&apos; by practical  or physical needs of. the  crudest kind.   We must be  prepared to  draw very largely upon our reserves of men and  our  accumulated reserves  of &quot;material, and wherever possible  to anticipate  and mort- gage  resources  which normally belong  to 1919.  We must  not mind  sacrificing,  within  certain  limits which will presently  be referred to, our offensive  war-making capacity in 1919, if thereby we can increase substantially the weight and  force of our attack in 1918.   We must not, for instance, consume  our limited  materials  andlabour  in  the  construction of factories or  plants or organisations which cannot mature till 1919.   We mustbe ready to make an effort in 1918 which, if it fails, willsensibly weaken our  offensive powers in 1919.    32. The alternative decision in favour  of &quot; climaxing &quot;in 1919 involves in  the  province of munitions measuresof the following kind :     (a.)  Building up strong reserves of  ammunition at          the end of the  year.  This could Nbe  done  if         the  expenditure of ammunition by the British         army  in 1918 did not  exceed  what  has been         provided  for   1917.   There   would  be  no         decrease in  1918, but  the  increase  for which         we were preparing would in principle be held         Over till the following year.                  &apos;.   (6.) Early  and punctual discharge to the  repairing         shops during the autumn of 1918 of all natures         of guns whose lives  are becoming exhausted.         This would enable the offensive of 1919 to         begin at the earliest possible  moment in full         force.   (c.) A large  new heavy gun programme  should be         undertaken  so as to ensure  a substantial         preponderance in heavy artillery in 1919.   (d.) Recruitment  should be  kept low  in   1918, all         our  available labour, especially all our skilled         labour,  being   employed  on  shipbuilding,         artillery, and aeroplanes.   (e.) Considerable   factory reorganisation should be         carried  out in  1918  with a view  to  the         improved  classification of particular  classes         of production in  particular  places,  and  very
           large schemes of training skilled labour should           be taken  in  hand.  These methods  should           allow  a considerable  release of  skilled  men           to the army  in  1919  without  prejudice  to           output.    There  are  many other  features  of a  1919  climax in munitions  with  which  this  paper need  not  be complicated.    33. The  importance of taking  a decision one way or the other is  obvious, and on a clear direction being given depends much of the  efficiency and higher economy of munitions output.  Either alternative can  be provided for, but it will not be sensible for  some departments to stake their all on 1918 while others are calmly preparing plans which cannot reach  fruition  till a  much later period.  Nor would it be reasonable for the army to fight to a  finish in 1918, straining the  lives of the guns and consuming; the reserves  of ammunition to the  utmost extreme and till  very late in the  year, and  then, if a decision has not been obtained,  to expect  an equally good or even larger output in the  following year.  There ought  to  be  a  clear  policy  and  a complete  under- standing.    34. At the same time, while the decision  may be vital in character- its  scope is  confined within certain  limits. If 1919 is  chosen  for the  climax, the British  armies in 1918  will  still  be  very  powerful, equipped wdth abundant  munitions  and capable of  fighting  great battles, though the fewer the better (as we should  be saving up).  If,  on  the other  hand, 1918 is  chosen for the supreme climax, and the German  armies are after all not decisively beaten in that  year, it would still  be possible for  us to go on  in  1919,  and be a formidable partner in a  great American effort.   The clear cut choices of the past year of the war are no longer open.   It is in the main a question of emphasis.  The great bulk of our armies must be employed in the West, and  can only be main- tained and operated on the railway systems of the West, and being there they will certainly  fight.   &quot;Whatever fighting they do in 19! 8,-they will, if  the war continues, be able to fight again in 1919.-  The difference involved is probably  not more  than 25 per  cent, one way or the other.  But  that may be  the 25 per  cent, which turns the scale.  In fact,  the  question at issue is at the same time  one within manageable  limits, and one which ought&quot;certainly not to be left to settle itself by drifting.          Vl         WINSTON S.
