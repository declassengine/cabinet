(This Document is toe Property cfHis Britannic f$ajesty&apos;s Governm^ )S EO-B E219OPERAT IONS.From?- 0eneral Delme Radcliffe,  Italy.C.I.G.S.., War Office,23.10.19172.10 p,m,505. PERSONAL &amp; SECRET.-     your 44069 of 27th instant,   Cadorna thanks yougratefully for the assistance you have promised andrequests that British divisions may be sent as can bearranged with the French authorities.   At present hisintention is to concentrate British and French divisionsround Brescia, as information h&amp;s been received of aGerman concentration in the Trentino with the object ofinvading west of Lake Garda.     Although a debacle of many units of the 2nd Army hastaken place, the troops have not shown revolutionary ormutinous tendency but have laid down their arms and equip-ment and quietly walked off without awaiting contactwith the enemy4    Fugitives are being collected wherepossible and will be placed in concentration camps andone in ten shot.,   Cn the other hand, 3rd Army has so farmaintained its discipline and is retiring in good orderto a line from Codroipo to Latisane,  Three fresh divisionshave been sent up to Pinzano to occupy area-about exitof Tagllamento river from the mountains.   Not all theunits of the 2nd Army have lost their discipline .and itis hoped to collect sufficient force of these to holdline of Tagliamento for some days and reform army.  Therefusal of the troops to fight is apparently an organizedplot on Russian lines and probably put intw operationin agreement with the enemy.   Although Commando Supremohad
had no Idea o.f the extent of&apos; this plot, Cadorna, suspectingthat improper influences were at work,, addressed remonstrancesto the Government four times during the last few months,.because proper steps were not taken in the country to suppressthem and T understand the Government gave him no support..     Apparently the 2nd Army has lost most cf the heavy,.almost all the medium, and part of the field artillery,.  3rdArmy has also lost&apos;heavy artillery but has saved medium andfield artillery so far.     I am informed that British Artillery has been withdrawn.I saw Hamilton yesterday and he felt sure that the 3rd Armywould do all it could to save his guns.     In both 2nd and 3rd Armies ammunition supplies heavy andfield of all kinds have probably been all lost.&apos;     The King went to Rome the night before last In connectionwith the Cabinet crisis.  It is expected that he will takeenergetic steps to recall the nation tc a sense of the gravityof the position and the necessity of straining every nerve tomake good the harm done, pointing out that it is Internaltreachery and not the enemy that has defeated the army.   TheKing&apos;s spirit is high and he is determined to support Cadornato the utmost,  Cadcrna thinks that there are enough disciplinedand patriotic troops left to retrieve the position and to takethe offensive again later on,  As soon as possible he willwithdraw to the line of the Piave,  but recognises that he may bejforced to retire eventually to the  line of the Mincie,  For thepresent, Commando Supremo remains at Trevisc
