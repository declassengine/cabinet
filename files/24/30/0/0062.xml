            (This Pocufflsnt i* the Property of     Colonel Jones            His Britannic %teje8ty&apos;g Government j                                                         383Operations,                            SECRET.From     General Barter, Russia.To       C.I.G.S., War Office.                       Handed in 9.5&apos; p.m. 27th October. 1917.                       Received 2 a.m. October 31st 1917.No. 1342 October 27th.       Following obtained from Q.M.G. to-day.       General strategical situation in North is based ondefence of Gulf of Finland which protects approach toPetrograd in its turn.  There are two organised lines ofresistance and both contain areas defence of which is in thehands of the navy.       First is Revel and Sveaborg.   This includes landdefences of Revel .consisting of several concentric lines oftrenches and both land and sea fortifications.  There are1,270 heavy guns in all in Revel area most of which areold style but contain some modern 9&quot; guns and 6&quot; guns.The majority of the guns from Kronstad have been broughthere a fact not generally known.  The land forces defendingline of coast of Pernau Revel consist of six infantrydivisions and four cavalry divisions under General Hendrikson.Further south a mobile corps of four infantry divisions has&apos;been formed from units of 12th Army.   Outside Revel theislands of Narg Vulf and Vranglesly contain 9&quot; and 10&quot;batteries.  On the Finnish side Sveaborg and Norkola arealso fortified containing guns which range almost to Revel.       The Gulf itself is heavily mined (this is 3rd minefield from entrance to Gulf) there being two passages only.       There are no land defences to north beyond Norkolathe line of trenches projected after the revolution was notbuilt owing to opposition of Finland.       Thus right flank  1st line is defenceless and open toany attack which results from enemy landing in Finland.       Second line is- stronger and runs from south of Pskovvia Lake Chutski Narova river both horns of Lukska Bay(Sea Batteries) to islands of Lavansari, Somer, Tomisaricontaining two 10&quot; batteries and four 6&quot; batteries to Finlandcoast near Kiminlina,  Line of trenches defence northward  -runs from west of Kiminlina to St. Mikel west of the railway.       The shore batteries contain same calibre guns asthose at Revel and Sveaborg,  Gulf here is particularlyheavily mined.  Defence of the Baltic littoral and of theroad to Petrograd depends on question of whether Russianinfantry will fight or not.Q.M.G.
   i    Q.M.G. stated that Improvement in morale wasdistinct and unmistakable since Riga disaster.  There isa  strong movement originating among men themselves fordiscipline which gives hopes that Russian forces willmake better show in future encounters with Germans.Several attempts at landing in Gulf of Riga Line havebeen made but without success by Germans.       In addition to troops already mentioned PetrogradGarrison proposed to form special battalions of infantryfor defence of Revel but Q.M.G. doubted they wouldmaterialize or in any case be of any value.  Q..M.G. quiteconvinced that Germans intend to prolong campaign innorth having Finland and Petrograd as objectives.  It issignificant that German Agents are buying large quantitiesof stores in Sweden which are being sent north.  It ispossible that Germans contemplate moving on Finland overice taking their stores, from north of Sweden.  Q.M.G.was asked ?fhether he did not think so but (? thought) thatGermans would not consider Swedish feelings nor wouldthe Swedes protest too much.   They have nothing to gainby open declaration of war in Finland, as large majorityof Finns are as much against becoming part of Sweden asagainst any further suzerainty on the part of Russia.
