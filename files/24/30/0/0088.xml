mm&amp;m OF BLOCKADE iMom&amp;siQu.47326th Oct.  - let Bov.1917.The German success on the Isonzo front hashad the effect of checking the downward movement of themark exchange on certain bourses.  In Switzerland the markrate rose from 61.50 to 63.00 on Monday, the 29th Get; atStockholm the rate was 34.25 on the 30th as compared with      33.80 on the  29th;   at  Copenhagen it  rose  from  40. to .40.50      between the 26th and the  29th.   It ie perhaps due to the      political  tension between Norway and  Germany that the      Christiania money mar&amp;et  was  absolutely unaffected by the      news of the fall of  Gorisia.  Switserland  is however the      only one of these neutrals who is prepared to pay as much      as 50,1 of the  pre-war price for  marks.MMAiyC.    A serai-offlolal statement  in the Danish prese estimates      that the wheat harvest  of 1917 is 40$ below normal, and that      the rye harvest  is also below normal.  If  the statement is      correct there will be a dearth of bread-cereals in Denmark      some time  before the  next harvest  ie  ripe.  Owing to the      shortage of meat and  edible fats  it is not possible to reduce      the existing bread-rations.   Denmark  has however obtained      from Germany a large  quantity of iioumanian barley in compensa-      tion for exports of agricultural  produce to Germany.  The      barley will be used In  the Danish brewerieB.            This ie not the only way in which the Germans are      assisting  Denmark to  defy the Anglo-American embargo.  Large      quantities of petroleum and petrol have lately reached      Copenhagen from  Germany, to the great relief of Danish      industrial interests.   But the Danes are beginning torealise that Germany charges  too  high  a price  for aachaccommodation.
  The Jutland fishermen hare repudiated their contract for  German petroleum, on discovering that it would hind them to  sell fish to the Central Purchasing Company of tho German  Government at miserable prices.  The Danish Government have -  refused an offer of German potatoes, because it was stipula-  ted that the potatoes should be used exclusively to fatten  pigs for the Danish market, and that the German share of  Danish pork-exports should be increased.  To accept these  terms would have meant an immediate and serious dispute with  the Allies.        The War Trade Board at Washington have dr&amp;fted a  Schedule of rations for Denmark;   tout H.w. Government con-  eider that the rations of lubricating oil, linseed oil and  copper Ore too high and have asked that the schedule should  be revised accordingly.  The draft proposals of the itoard for  regulating Danish agricultural  exports have been approved  toy H.M. Government.        In Sweden as in Denmark the  shortage of mineral oils  is acute.   Twenty tons of machine  oil lately arrived from  Germany, and sixty tons of lubricating oil from Austria;  but!  theso quantities will not go far.   Austria may be  able  to  eUpply some petroleum, but not  more  than one  per cent  of  Sweden^ annual requirements.   The Swedish fishermen are  pressing their Government to obtain petroleum immediately,  either from the Central Powers  or  from the  Allies.   rihey are  prepared,  if the Allies will help  them,  to  desist  from  exporting  fish to Germany and to send ttoir whole exportable  surplus to the United kingdom.        The  new Swedish Government are  apparently desirous to  make a compromise with the Allies,   air K.  Howard expects  to receive a proposal that the exports  of  Swedish ore shall  be equally divided between the two  sets  of  belligerents. He
a 3 K      also learne that the Government would not  object to  an agree-      meat between the Swedish shipowners and H*M*  Government,  if      the agreement is limited to  Bwe&amp;iah vessels trading  in the      Horth Sea and other European waters.   It is also stated that i      a reasonable settlement  of the  Russian transit  question may      be now expected.             The lines!as Ambassador at  Washington does not believe      that Sweden is likely, at this  stege. to intervene in the      war as a belligerent.  But the  United States  Government      apparently think it inadvisable to  press Sweden any  further      until agreements have been concluded  with  Denmark and li or way      and Sweden is left in isolation.  Mr.  Hordmann  of the  Russian      Foreign Office,  who is now in Mm&amp;on, thinks  that the  negotia-      tions with Sweden would  be more likely to  succeed if they were      continued here,  and not  at Washington.   The change of  venue      would enable the Swedish Government to appoint  new delegates      of a more accommodating  temper;   those  who are  actually at      Washington represent the views  of the late Ministry.flOfrffAY.      The discussions of Dr.  $ansen with the  United  states      War Trade Board  de not seem  likely to  serve any useful      purpose,  as he has no power  to  commit hisGovernment, and      has been furnished with  impossible instructions.  The  War      Trade Board are  considering  whether it would not be wise to      transfer these negotiations  to  Ohristiania.  H.H.Government      would welcome this step;   they  are suggesting that H or way      should be invited to stop all exports to Germany, if she      desires to obtain supplies from the United Kingdom and the      United States.  H.M. Government would however be prepared      in the last resort to permit the exportation of Norwegian    .  fish to Germany  at the rate of  40,000 tons  per  annum, if all      other exports to Germany are prohibited and if the fish is
                           - 4 -         exported by monthly instalments.  This concession would be         held to release us from our purchasing obligations under         the Fish Agreement, whioh hate become very burdensome owing         to the unfavourable rate of the Norwegian exchange.  But         Sir M. Final ay reports that the general inclination in         Norway, even among the fishermen, is to stop all exports of         fiah and canned goods to Germany, as a measure of reprisal         for the murders of Norwegian seamen in the 2for th Be a.aiiTHEflLAffPS.    The H.O.T. have notified the Dutch Government of         their readiness to accept our proposals for a Coal and         Tonnage Agreement.              The Dutch Government still refuse to give satisfactory         undertakings as to the transit of sand and gravel.  Conse-         quently the French and British Censors continue to hold up         all Dutch commercial cables.  It is possible that Holland         may retaliate by prohibiting the export of sugar or mineral         oil.  But in that case H.M. Government would refuse facilities         at Halifax to all Dutch vessels, and would prevent them from         receiving British bunker coal.  Bven tho more extreme step         of requisitioning Dutch ships In British ports is under con-         side ration.$Mwm&amp;KXiAIID.     The French Government are asking President Wilson         to leave in their hands the elaboration of any definite scheme         for rationing Switzerland.       Government vdll support this         request.   Uffljg&amp;J) STATES.     The United States Government will probably assume         control of all home-grown cotton in the near future, and         will distribute the exportable surplus among the Allies in         proportion to their needs.  They anticipate an aoute short-
                   - 6 - age of cotton in September, 1918.  But. in estimating the re- quireraente of the United kingdom, they aye apparently prepared to make an allowance on account of our export trade.      we have submitted to the United States a scheme for a joint and comprehensive control over all neutral shipping. 2he Scheme involves close cooperation between the United States Shipping Board and the Inter-Allied Chartering Exeou- tive, but there is no Idea of fusing the two bodies.  All future contracts with neutral ship-owners would be made on the basis of an agreed scale of rates;   and the available tonnage would be divided between the two boards by agreement. All neutral ships would be chartered for the period of the war and six months after, without any restriction as to the nature of the trade into which they may be put.  Mo private chartering of neutral ships would be sanctioned by either Board except on the understanding that the ships may be re- allotted at the discretion of that Board.      It is considered most important that the United States should be induced to accept some such scheme.   At present there is a want of co-ordination between the policy of the United states Shipping Board and that of the Inter-AlliedChartering Executive.  Charter-rates are liable to be in- flat e&amp; by competition between these two bodies.  She UnitedStates Board does not keep a sufficiently  tight hand on the operations of private charterers.   Difficulties have constant ly arisen in mapping out general schemes of transport because of vexations and needless variations in the terms and condit- lons of chartering.  The United States  may not accept every detail of the present scheme.  But the  essential point is that they should accept and abide by some shipping  policy wfrtsh has no other object than that of securing the  maximum amount  of tonnage on the best terms that uan be arranged, and employing it in the most efficient manner for the common purp6ees  of
