E0919.on FRAJCE.a BLEivDECQUESM. le Mardohal.- -     Por some timo past tho enemy air services havo shownincreasing-activity, and havo systematically bombarded theports and factories in tho Northern region..     Their efforts-havo boon soecially directed againstthe ports of BUUKIRS, CALAIS and BuULOGHE, which servo asHavai Bases.to the British Armies, any damage.to whichmay have a very serious, effect. &apos; At DUNKIRK, for example,...there is a danger that the port might bo blocked by asuncon ship.   Again, if a bomb fell on the lock gateswhich enclose the steamer basins, the port 7/ould bereduced to a mere, tidal port,.  The dockers threaten toquit tho town.   In fact, when one considers tho effect  .of loss of life and damage to material which might accrue,it is easy to realise how important it is to afford ampleprotection to this district.     There is reason to believe that the increased activityby the enemy in this district is due to the severe aerialbombardments which oe have carried out against the backareas occupied by the Germans.-  It Is doubtful whether themilitary damage cause  by us to the enemy between the sea.and the Lys is commensurate with that which he has causedto us.     I request, therefore,, that you will be so good as toconsider whether it vyould not be advantageous to modifyour tactics in regard to these bombardments, and to limitour activity exclusively to ettaoks against hostile aero-dromes.   As a matter of fact, the best defence againstaerial bombardments consists in seeking out and destroyingenemy me chines.-:     In order,, however, that the enemy may not interpretour inactivity against towns in the back areas of thonorthern district as a oonfession of weakness,, it wouldbe advisable at the same time to concentrate our effortsagainst territory whioh is entirely German, such asRhenish Bavaria  nd tho Duohy of Baden, and at tho sametime to make it clear that these operations are con-ducted as reprisals.  -For instance,  every time thatDUMIRJC, CALAIS or 30UL03HS are bombarded,  a combined.operation by&apos;the English and French Air Services, mightbe carried out against one of the German towns in. this  -district.I-
     Apart from the; above, there exist at present at33UHZIHK, CALAIS and BOULOGNE a certain num er ofFrench and British Antiaircraft guns and searchlights.In order that closer co-operation may be ensuredbetween these units, I suggest for your considerationthat all the British units, both Anti-Aircraft gunsand searchlights, located in the zone of defence ofthe above ports,  should be placed under the ordersof the French &quot;Defence Commander&quot;.                        III.     I roquest that you will  lot me know-as, soon aspossible your views on the two questions raised ebove.                           Tree Sinee*rement votre,                      (Signed)   Ph.

                                      15th October, 1917.0.B./1837/1From:-           The Commander-in-Chief,                  British Armies in France.Tot-           The Commander-in-Chief;                  French Armies of the North and North-east. .My dear General,        I have delayed answering your letter No.20919 of  the-20th September, in order to cbnsidqrjoaore fully the questionsyou have raised.        The proposal In para *   of your letter, to place  allthe Anti-aircraft defences of the ports of Dunkerque, Calaisand Boulogne under the tactical orders of the local French&quot;Defence Commanders&quot;, ha3 already been put into effect byorders which&apos;I have had issued on the subject.        As regards tho remainder of your letter, while deploringthe loss of life and. material damage already inflicted by theGermans on the ports Of Dunkerque, Calais and Boulogne, andwhile, fully realising the very serious effect which might beproduced under certain circumstances, I regret that I amunable,to concur ih principle in your proposal that in futureour attacks should be limited to the bombing of aerodromes only.        The experience of the last 18 months has convinced methat success in the air can only be attained by the prosecutionof a vigorous offensive at all times.    The bombing of onemyrear oormmini cat ions forms an Integral and important part  ofsuch offensive operations; it is confined to objects ofmilitary, importance only.   To restriot this bombing to hostileaerodromes would be to deprive it of much of its value, andwould probably have the effect of freeing many more enemymachines for offensive purposes against us.        The effect whioh reprisals on German towns in SouthGermany would have on the German army on the Western front,and especially&apos;on the German army in Flanders, is a factorthe value of which has non;/ been fully tested.   As you know,the principle has been accepted by my Government and British -air forces have been detailed for this special purpose.Meanwhile J see no reason to suppose that the gratuitoussurrender.on our part of a powerful means of offence againstthe German army would, result in a corresponding abandonmenton the part of the Germans of a potent means of causing usmoral and material damage.

If you  agree with this  view,  i shall be obliged ifyou will kindly give similar orders to the British squadronswhich have been  detached in the Nancy region.(Sgd)     Petain.O.A.D.  644/1.  &apos;                                            24th October, 1917.From:-The Commander-in-Chief,-    British Armies in France.To:-&apos;       The  Commander-in-Chief,               French  Armies  of  the  North and  North-east.My dear General,        In reply  to your letter No..24068 dated 21st October, Iagree with you in principle that our aerial operations shouldbo directed with  the sole aim of delivering frequent ana heavyattacks on military objectives,  and  that isolated and weakattacks are unsound quite apart from the  question of provokingreprisals,. .         &apos;                        .        My instructions  to the  British air squadrons are to avoidpromiscuous bombing and  ^tO attack selected military targets only.AS regards the  scope of  these attacks,  I have  laid down that
never less than 6 machines shall he detailed either &quot;by  day  ornight to  attack any given objective..    Owing to technicalconsiderations  I do not consider it advisable to lay down aminimum weight  of bombs to be dropped... but I am satisfied thatthe  result of my instructions will be the correct applicationof the  principle on which we  are both agreed.                      Yours very truly,                                (Sd.)   3V HAIG.                                        Field-Marshal.Copies  to  :.- -                 G.O.C.,  !?,F.C,
