Since the  lastreport, 7 convoys, consisting of 99 ships (719,7*00tons deadweight)  have arrived, 4 casualties due  toenemy action having occurred.    Out of H.M.S.  &quot;PUMAH&quot; convoy,the s/s &quot;POLVENA&quot; (a  Prize ship) and s/s &quot;MANCHURIA&quot;  weretorpedoed.     Out of H.M.S. &quot;HIGHFLYER&quot; convoy,  the  s/s&quot;MADURA&quot; was torpedoed a mile astern of the convoy,having lost her position at night.     Out of H.M.S.&quot;MABSHFORT&quot; convoy, the Greek ship &quot;BCAT2RINI&quot;  slowed downand apparently surrendered to the enemy.    This  ship hasnot bsen heard of since,  but is presumed to be  sunk.In addition to the above casualties tho A.M.C.&quot;ORAMA&quot; was sunk.     It is understood that all hercrew were saved.       There were no casualties due tomarine peril  but  the s/s &quot;LESSEPS&quot; and &quot;KAWARA&quot; werein,collision shortly  after leaving Gibraltar inH.M.S. &quot;SENEGAf3&quot;  convoy.    Both shins were slightly^ SECRETARY,WAR CABINET,
damaged, but  the &quot;KlWiiEA- proceeded&apos;v on her journey -Fifteen convoys, consisting of 243  ships are nowon passage home. The  total number of homeward  boundconvoys handled since the system was institutedis 105, consisting of 1604 ships1 of 11,451,700 tonsdeadweight.      (b) Outward bound convoys      Since the lastreport, 6 convoys, consisting of 60 ships  (458,500tons  deadweight) have been escorted through thedanger zone.  Two casualties were sustained by enemyaction.  Out  of the Mediterranean convoy fromLiverpool, the s/s &quot;PERA&quot; was torpedoed East ofMalta Channel, and the s/s &quot;COLLEGIAN&quot; was torpedoed100 miles off port Said. The s/s &quot;SAN NA^IO&quot;, whichsailed in a convoy from Devonport on the 14th instant,was torpedoed, but was able to return to Devonportunder her own steam. The s/s &quot;TROWBRIDGH&quot; out of aFalmouth convoy, had to put back owing jjo enginetrouble. Seven convoys, consisting  of 92 ships, arenow in the danger zone, A statement is attachedshowing the number of convoys, ships and tonnageconvoyed to the 20th October, 1917.           Two tables of percentages are also enclosedStatement &quot;B&quot; shows (in the case of homeward boundconvoys) the  percentage of losses,  including losseswhich have occurred to ships which had got separatedfrom  the main body, while Statement &quot;C&quot; shows onlythe casualties which have occurred while the  shipswere actually in convoy formation.  The figures inthe latter &quot;statement afford a strong argument insupport of the theory of comparative invulnerabilityfrom  submarine attack of ships in large groups.

The following Norwegian ships; have  been requisitioned:-  s/s  &quot;BAMSE&quot;,  &quot;DUX&quot;,  &quot;DENEB&quot;, &quot;BROMMA&apos;%  &quot;NOSTED  I&quot;, &quot;RSIBAR&quot;,  &quot;SIMDET&quot;,  &quot;HUNTER&quot;, &quot;i)JERVM, &quot;ATMS&quot;,  &quot;JOTUN&quot;.

MEDITERRANEAN RISKS.           The question of the extra risks  to whichMerchant ships bound.for the  East Have been exposed, and the casualties  sustained,  notwithstanding theprotection afforded by convoys, since the re-opening of the Mediterranean for through  traffic, has
received Serious consideration; after discussionwith representatives of the Admiralty, howeverthe conclusion was arrived at., that the bossesso far reported constituted .no sufficient reason forcancelling&quot; the arrangements made.   BELAYM^SHIPS&apos;UNDER THE.CONVOY AHRANGEMBNTS.        Representations have1 been made that delayhas been caused to ships owing to the large numberof ships arriving together in convoy, and alsoas to. the loss of work in the tort of Londonoccasioned by the diversion of tonnage to Westernports for. the greater safety of the ships,  acertain amount of delay and of inconvenience owingto the &quot;bunching&quot; of ships is an inevitableincident of the convoy system, but so far aspresent experience goes the advantages greatlyoutweigh-the disadvantages.  With regard to the-port of London, there was undoubtedly for atime a- great reduction in the number of vesselsdischarging, at the port and some unemploymentresulted., Steps have however been taken to directadditional-vessels to London and in the meantime                                              vthe labour is being kept together. The convoysystem so .far from increasing the difficultiesof the port should minimise them, as ships whf$hif unattended could be  sent to a Western  portfor reasons of safety can-be brought in underescort..
b.       LOSSES ON BLUE BOOK RATES.               The Shipping Controller  has  had under     his consideration the  representations  that have     &quot;been made  to  him from  various  quarters to the     effect  that owners fif  vessels requisitioned on     Blue Book  rates  are  in some  cases  unable, under     present conditions,  to keep.their  vessels running     except  at  a financial   loss&apos;to  themselves,  and     for the purpose  of ascertaining the  facts he has  .     arranged for  a joint investigation to  take  place     by  a representative  of this Department,  together     with an accountant nominated by the  Chamber of     Shipping of .the  United Kingdom.               STORAGE OF GRAIN AT WESTERN  PORTS.                   Considerable progress  has  been made    .in  connection with the  provision of  further     facilities for the storage of grain  at the  principal     &quot;estern perts. New sheds h^ve been contracted for     at  Swansea, ^vonmouth,  Cardiff, Barry  and Newport     with a  total-area of 110,1^7 square  yards, an estimated     capacity of 330,381 tons of bagged grain  16r high,     at  a total cost  of  47^,757. &apos;                     I  am,                         Sir,                       Your obedient  Servant,                           (Sgd) John Anderson.
