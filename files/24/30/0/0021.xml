Our lnforma- tion is that not more than five or seven Germans Divisions have gone to Italian front and there has been no material increase of Austrians .  But the Italian left cn Julian front has given way badly and Cadorna is contemplating falling back on the Tagliam- ento and if that is also turned from North then to the Lower Piave. Having regard to relative numbers and terrain, this situation ought never to have arisen,  tut it has arisen and it is of first military importance that it should be adequately dealt with so that Italy may be kept as effectively in the field as is possible. Otherwise the result may be  really disastrous to the Entente cause. The War Cabinet entirely agree with these views.  As the Italian troops are so unreliable it  is quite impossible  to say what effortwill be demanded from us to  restore the situation.  But it is probable that your two Divisions now under orders  will have to be immediately followed by four others and a proportion of heavy artillery and for this contingency you should be prepared.  I askyou to give all assistance you can in the selection of troops  and in expediting their despatch.

As showing our desire to help, it is also mostdesirable that they should reach Italy before all the Frenchdivisions arrive.  The War Cabinet concurs  in these views,  Fochstates that our divisions can be transported alternately withthe French divisions.

Owing mainly to bad morale and peace propaganda,  theItalian situation is very bad,  Cadorna has not yet made  aspecific request for assistance but he represents that the moraleof his Army would be greatly improved by,such assistance  whichwould also reassure the country generally.   The question  will beconsidered by the War Cabinet on Monday. Meanwhile please takepreliminary steps to make two Divisions ready for despatch butdo not make railway arrangements or otherwise communicate in anyway with the French or Italian authorities  on the subject as thatwould place us in an awkward position if the Cabinet decideagainst assistance.  I am aware that your available divisionsare battle worn and Cadorna ought not to require help but wemay have to help in order to prevent the total collapse ofItaly which would be a serious matter.

I am forwarding a memorandum from Cadorna to you whichdescribes the present military situation and states hisintention to hold the enemy as long as possible on the linereferred to in my 495 of this morning, and as an alternativeto withdraw the army on the Julian front by echelon to the lineof the Tagliamento In order to reform it and make freshresistance on that line.   He further states his intention ofwithdrawing the forces in Carnia and Cadoro to their respectivelines of resistance in rear, preliminary to a concentrateddisposal of the army, which he proposes to carry cut If thesituation should require lt facing north on the Trentino frontand east along the course of the Piave river.  The memorandumends with the following sentence:-        &quot;The situation which I have literally represented bothas it is and in regard to future possibilities suffices to makeclear the utmost utility of a direct intervention on the scalealready agreed upon, or even a larger scale.  In pointing outto the High Allied French and British Commands this utility,I interpret also the opinion of the Royal Government, whichthrough diplomatic channels intends to approach the Governmentsof the Entente in the same sense,11

Following for Col,  Fagaide  :*   For Chief of  Imperial General  Staff.   General Cadorna has   asked for Allied help.  At  the  earliest  possible  moment  four   French Divisions complete  in artillery and an Army staff  are   starting; complete  transport will  take 13 days. General  Fooh,   in view of agreement with  General  Cadorna, wishes  to know whether   British troops  are  also  going  tc be  sent.  Transport either   alternate French and British Divisions or British  to follow   French can then be  arranged,        The first  division  to go  will be a French one In any case.

Enemyforces on the left flank must be weak and have little artillery.So time should be gained to complete withdrawal and great partof artillery  and ammunition unless a panic sets in.   GeneralStaff  very anxious that there should be announced even smallcontingents of French or British troops as on their way inorder  to encourage country and army.

    The Italians, I believe, have lost about 500 medium guns and howitzers and over 150 field and mountain guns; also 40,000 prisoners, chiefly of the 43rd and 50th Divisions and Alpine troops surrounded on Monte Nero.

    About 70 Italian medium batteries have been withdrawn successfully from the Bainsizza Plateau. Monte Video Santo and the Vodici are still held. Matajur and Globocak also are still held by the Italians, while, to occupy the new lines referred to in my telegram No. 495 to-day, fresh troops have been pushed up.

    I think the greater part of the Commands Supremo staff will probably leave to-night for Padua.

    The settlement is being faced by Cadorna with resolution: he has no intention of allowing himself to be overcome by it, he says.

    
SECRET .OPERATIONS.Prom:-    General Delme RadcliffeTo: -      C .1.0 .S .497. October 26th 1917.  Handed in 6.40 p.m.     Please read Porro for Cadorna in my telegram 495.     I have since seen Cadorna who repeated substantiallywhat General Fdrro said and added that the heavy artilleryis all now being withdrawn to the line of the Tagliamento.     General Capello is ill and General Montuori commandssecond Army in his place. Headquarters of the 2nd Army havebeen transferred from CIvidale to Udine where CommandoSupremo remain until 2nd Army retires if this should benecessaryj in this case Headquarters Of 2nd Army will betransferred to Pordenone and Commando Supremo provisionallyto Saclie.     Should it become necessary to withdraw from line runningfrom Monte Grapa to mouth of the Piave which is a very strongposition and which Cadorna would hold to the (?)uttermost,the Intendenza of the Army etc would be transferred to Padua *3rd Army is in excellent condition and is being graduallywithdrawn to West side of the Valone.  It will be required tohold enemy for some days to allow withdrawal of the heavyartillery^ ammunition, and stores as all the motor transportfor the moment is engaged on this service for the 2nd Army.     Bainsizza Plateau, Monte Vodicl and Monte Santo are beingevacuated; Monte Korada will be a pivot for the defence of the2nd Army front; if this Is taken by the enemy withdrawal ofthe whole 2nd Army will proceed.   Additional bridges arebeing construetbd in rear of 3rd Army front and on the Tagliam-ento River.     Cadoma said that he has informed the Government that ifpeace propoganda is allowed to continue in the country he willnot be responsible for the Army which has undoubtedly beenaffected and is not so reliable as it should be in the case ofsome units   while others have behaved very well.  He has givenvery stringent orders to open fire at once on any troops thatshow a tendency to misbehave.     He says that he desires the Allies to be clearly informedas,to the positlbn.   fee does not make any direct request butpoints out that the presence of Allied troops would greatlyimprove moral of ihe Army whioh is his chief preoccupation andshould go a long way towards reassuring the country.     6 batteries of French artillery have &quot;been lost, oo Iunders tand.
k o18OPERATIONS.                    SECRET.From :- General Delme Radcliffe.To :-   C.I.G.S.                          26.10.1917.                                                4.0 p.m.495.       I was informed this morning by General Cadorna thatduring the night the enemy succeeded, after a very heavybombardment, in again pushing back the left wing of the 2ndArmy.   The bombardment began at 2 a.m.  Some of the troops,it appears, did not fight well, especially the Rome andSele brigades, and he ascribes this to the effect of thepacificist propaganda which has affected some of the troops.        The enemy is known to have taken over 10,000 ofItalian prisoners on the 24th and about the same number lastnight.  Others again have fought very well) and orders havebeen given to take up a position on the line running fromMonte Maggiore through Monte Joannis and Purgessimo to MonteKorada, which General Porro thinks he can hold until theenemy has again brought his artillery forward.         The troops on this line would be some remnants of the4th, 7th, 24th, 27th and 28th Corps Joining up to the 2ndArmy Corps at Monte Korada.          The enemy&apos;s troops, it appears also, as was expected,are endeavouring to pass from Saga in the Isonzo Valley intothe Tagliamento Valley, and an enemy brigade is reported to bemoving in this direction.  A threat to the lines of communi-cation of the Carnia force is thus constituted, and a furtherstep in the encircling of the left wing of the 2nd Army.           General Cadorna is very much concerned at the effectthat this reverse may have on the country at large, as thereis no knowing what advantage may be taken by neutralistsand revolutionaries of the embarrassment caused by thesituation.           Cadorna Is, I know, meanwhile, very anxious for theoffer of a contingent cf French and British troops to reinforcetho Italian army, and I anticipate that an appreciation  of thesituation and perhaps a request for help will be sent shortly.The arrival of French and British troops will, Cadorna thinks,raise the morale of the Italian army and will have a verytranquillising effect on the country.           I am told by the General Staff that it Is being saidthat the co-operation of German troops with the Austrians isdue probably to the appearance of French and British batterieson the Isonzo front from which, before the present offensivebegan, many were withdrawn again.
