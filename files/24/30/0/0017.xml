(Thi* Document i$ the Property efHis Britannic Majesty&apos;?. Government)SECR ET.Operations.From:  General Ballard,  Roumania.To:C.I.G.SWar Office.22nd -October, 1917.  B.A. 767 cipher.      Dukonin has been  issuing specious  orders regarding discipline;  he has communicated these orders  officially to the Roumanian  G3vernment and possibly to the  other Governments  in  order  to main-  tain a pose of authority.   He  has at the  same time  carefully  re-  moved generals on this front wh^  were likely to carry  out  these  orders;  see my telegram B.A. 759 of October 18th.      This  inconsistent action springs from one of two  causes.  (First, he  is too weak  in any way  to withstand the committees and  these generals were turned out  because  the committees  personally  dislike  (2 groups undecipherable).   Second, Dukonin is deceiving  the Allies deliberately and so  pretending  to maintain  discipline,  while in reality he Is determined to weaken his own  army by remov-  ing all  generals who have any real authority. -  I am inclined  to  believe  in the. second  theory because there has been  a  simultaneous  removal  of the four best generals on this  front;  which l*oks  as if  the order  had been  inspired from  the Stafka.   I  believe the Govern-  ment  is  still  afraid of a counter-revolution and  is  therefore  deter-  mined to destroy any cohesion and authority in the army at any cost.  They have  not  only  dismissed the  fighting  generals but have by this  dismissal  shewn that too much zeal is a crime;  the  officers are  accepting  this warning.   The committees are also accepting this as  an intimation  that  they can dismiss any officer whom they  happen to  dislike;  German advice and money probably assists their choice.       These facts point to total demoralization and the Russianf Government must be  well aware of  it, but they will sacrifice the  cause  of the Allies sooner than admit position to us.Circulated to War Cabinet 23.10.17.
