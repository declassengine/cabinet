November 1917.SECRET.G.T.-2457.THE LABOUR  SITUATION.Report from the Ministry of Labour for the Week ending the 31st October, 1917.                                  SUMMARY.Part I:  General Remarks.    The Executive Council of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation have resolvedto allow the ballot on the &quot; comb-out &quot; to proceed.  Whatever may be the result ofthe ballot, no strike is anticipated.    General discontent has followed the 12  per cent, increase granted to skilledworkmen.Part II: Press Opinions.    The Labour press criticises the Government generally on the score of ineptitude,and specially for the postponement of the Education Bill and the Ministry of Health.The agitation for the &quot; conscription of wealth &quot; continues.    Complaints on  thesubject of shortage and control of food are rife.  The proposed new constitution forthe Labour Party has met with a hike-warm reception at the hands of the Socialistand LLP. press.Part III: District Reports.    In London, Wales, and Lancashire there is renewed agitation on the subject offood, though the trouble is not so much prices as scarcity.    In the West Midlands and Manchester there is much discontent at the methodsadopted by certain employers  following the withdrawal of  leaving certificates.    Yorkshire remains quiet,  but the South-Western area is restless.Part IV:  Strikes.    The serious strike of railway employees at Derby has  come to an end.    There have been no other strikes of first-rate  importance,  though  the  totalnumber  of strikes given by the Labour Statistics Department, namely 55, remainshigh.Part V: Disputes.    Reports from the Shipyard Labour Department and  Ministry of Munitionssuggest  continued unrest in the industries controlled by those Departments.   Thereports  from the  Coal Controller and War Office Contracts Department are moresatisfactory, though a serious dispute exists  in.the jute  industry in Scotland.                           I. GENERAL REMARKS.Developments in South Wales.    In the report for the week ending the 17th  October, the position  in SouthWales was discussed.  Subsequent events have justified the opinion, then expressed,that the resolution of the  Delegates&apos;  Conference of the 8th October on the subjectof the comb-out did not truly represent the attitude of the majority of the workers      [1100-2]                                                      B
in the mines.  During the last fortnight an agitation against the resolution of theDelegates&apos;  Conference has been initiated  by the  miners  themselves,  and  massmeetings have been held at many places at which  resolutions  have been passedprotesting  against the pacifist policy of the delegates.   The Executive Council, aswas reported  last week, gave- the men a  clear lead  against the proposals of theConference.    The central  office of  the Executive continued to be  flooded  withcopies of resolutions from mass meetings, and on the  29th instant the Council helda special meeting to consider the advisability of cancelling the orders for the ballot,which had been fixed for 1st and 2nd November.  After discussion of the questionit was unanimously resolved that the  balance of advantage lay in taking the ballot,and a resolution was passed accordingly, together with a second resolution pressingupon all workmen their  duty to  vote against  the resolution  of the  Delegates&apos;Conference.    At the same time the vigorous campaign of the War Aims Committee appearsto have had outstanding  results, notably the meetings addressed by Dr. Macnamaraat Abertillery on Saturday the 27th October, and by General Smuts at Cardiff andTonypandy on the 29th.   The pacifist party had  made  serious efforts to  organiseopposition  at Tonypandy, but those efforts failed entirely.    Not  only  was themeeting itself enthusiastic in tone, and so large in numbers that an overflow meetinghad to be arranged, but the streets were full of crowds equally enthusiastic, gatheredto greet General Smuts.    At one point thousands had assembled who refused toallow him to pass on his way until he  had satisfied their demands for an impromptuspeech.    Tonypandy is  the hotbed of pacifism, and it was anticipated  that there, if any-where, hostile demonstration stood some chance of success.   It may,  therefore, beconcluded that the pacifist  party&apos;s vociferousness is out  of all proportion to itsinfluence.    The leaders of the  miners are  confident  that the ballot will show a  largemajority against the Delegates&apos; Conference.  They possibly fail to reckon with thelarge number of loyal lodges, which may voice their disagreement by abstentionfrom the ballot rather than by the record of a hostile  vote.  However the ballotmay go, it may be accepted with the utmost confidence that no  strike will follow,and that any attempt to  call a strike will be followed by disastrous  defeat.  Therecan be no question that, as a whole,  the mining population is sound and solid inits  determination that Germany shall be. defeated.The 12^ per cent. Increase.    The increase of 12Jr per cent, in the wages of skilled men is viewed as entirelyinadequate in most quarters.  Complaints on this score are rife in Manchester, theClyde, the Midlands, Yorkshire, and Woolwich, where skilled men are stated to beleaving the gauge room for unskilled work.   A further cause of discontent lies indoubt as to the classes to which, and to the date from which the increase applies.Machinists in particular express surprise and anger at their exclusion, and on theNorth-East coast are threatening to  strike.    An agitation has now commenced, and is spreading with great rapidity, withthe object of securing a similar  advance for semi-skilled and unskilled men.  If thatdemand is conceded it  is clear that the relative position of skilled men, in terms ofremuneration, will become even  worse than  it  was  before the  advance wassanctioned.                             II. PRESS OPINIONS.Criticism  of Government.    Vigorous criticism of the Government is a feature of the Labour press of theweek.   General allegations of incompetence are voiced by the &quot; Clarion &quot; and&quot; Justice,&quot; the  latter of which papers states  that  the only reason  preventing  acomplete revolution is ignorance as to who could possibly  take the place of thosewho are &quot; cleared out.&quot;  Criticism is also specially directed to the postponementof the Education Bill and of the constitution of the Ministry of Health.   On the
    latter subject &quot;Common Sense&quot; prints an article, and refers specially to Sir George    Newman&apos;s Report on the School Medical Service for 1916.  The article ends:              &quot; We are preparing to spend fifty million pounds more a year on the pay of our soldiers         and sailors, but we can scarcely hope that for the care of their children as many thousands will         be found. The sacrifice to Mars brings with it the yet more pathetic sacrifice to Moloch.&quot;    Conscription of Wealth.        The agitation in favour of a tax on capital is maintained.  The &quot; New Age    recommends such a tax on the ground that the proposal to conscript wealth as well    as men would put an  end. to the  war.        The &quot;Leicester Pioneer &quot; has a long article on the &quot; Conscription of Riches &quot;    examining the various methods of taxation which have been suggested.  The writer    is  apparently willing  to accept  any  one  of them.    One  proposal  suggests  the    imposition of a duty at the existing death duty rates on every person in the kingdom    possessing over 300/., such  person being legally deemed to have died and to be his    own heir.  Another of the plans, a product of the ingenuity of Mr. W. C. Anderson,    M.P., is for the sequestration, until further  notice, of all unearned incomes     subsistence allowances at the same rate as the pay of the several ranks  in the army    being provided for persons  who cannot obtain work.    Government Control.        The Labour press is this  week singularly free from criticisms of Government    control, except in the matter of food.   The &quot; Woolwich Pioneer&quot; has a paragraph    on the  struggle for food.            &quot; For the poor, at all events, the struggle for food threatens to  return to the levels of         savagery.  One either has to fight among scores of other women, fighting likewise,  for quarters         of tea and half-pounds of margarine, or stand for hours outside shops in a long queue to be         similarly rewarded for patience as for struggle.  Shopping has now to be classified  with the        most trying occupations.&quot;        The same paper  reports that there is  a shortage  in  Woolwich  of  butter,    margarine, and bacon, the effects of the shortage being aggravated by the fact that    large numbers of married  women who are employed in munition factories start work    before the shops are opened, and do not finish until it is too  late to purchase.        The I.L.P. journals  use the world&apos;s shortage of food and the misery which it    entails  as an argument for conclusion of an early peace.        Several of the papers comment adversely on the fact that, while tea is constantly    rising in price, beer has been cheapened.        Several  papers again recommend the immediate introduction of  compulsory    rationing.  The &quot;Clarion&quot;  in  an article.headed &quot; Yapping &quot;, criticises  Sir  Arthur    Yapp&apos;s  recommendations  as to food economy  and saj^s:   .            &quot; Damn his politeness and his barking.  Why doesn&apos;t he bite?  What is the good of all        these  petty economies on the  part of some people, whilst other  people can and will go  on        indulging  in extravagances which more than neutralise them?   . .   .  The one and only        royal road to economy  is to have every morsel of  food  cooked with the greatest skill and        consumed with the greatest care under  the public eye.  Only invalids  who cannot leave their        rooms should be given food in private.&quot;       Several papers report fixation cf milk prices by Food Control Committees below   the permitted maximum price.   In at  least one case this has led  to the entire with-   drawal  of  the supply of milk from the local area, the milk being sold in adjoining   areas where the maximum price is allowed.   The Constitution of the Labour Party.       The proposed new constitution of the Labour Party has  been the theme  of   articles  in all the Labour  journals of the week, which have, awakened  to  the   importance of the main features.   Its reception can only be described as hike-warm.   There is in most quarters ill-disguised disappointment of  the  hopes entertained   by  the   various   socialist  bodies  that the  constitution  would  be  so  framed   as  to enable  the  minority to exert a  preponderating  influence.    The  I.L.P.   and Socialist journals are particularly disappointed with the retention of the block
 vote, which  practically enables a  few representatives of important unions to out- vote the expression of opinions held by individual members, however numerous the latter may be.     On this  point the &quot; Labour Leader &apos;&apos; writes:          &quot; The tyranny of the massed  vote of the great industrial organisations will still remain,      and the  genuinely political element affiliated to the organisation will still be hampered in the      influence of their opinons.  .  .   .  The  proposals  of the Labour  Party are  a  call  to the      I.L.P. to strengthen its own organisation.  The I.L.P. offers the reform that the Labour Party      cannot namely, a genuinely democratic party with clear and definite principle and aims.&quot;     The &quot; South Wales Pioneer&quot;  (another I.L.P.  organ) hopes that the I.L.P. will sooner  or later be able to persuade unions to allow minority votes to be  cast at Labour Party conferences, while the &quot; Call &quot; considers that the bloc vote is calculated to crush out &quot; aspirations to direct the activities *of the Party in accordance with the [Socialist] objective,&quot;  and deems that a definite  Socialist  Party  will  still remain  essential.    The provision for individual membership is criticised adversely from two points of view, one  group considering that there is a fear that  the party will be swamped by  &quot;middle  class Radicals disgusted with the old parties,&quot; the  other  doubtingwhether the  attractions of individual membership will  be  sufficient to tempt the &quot;intellectuals &quot; or  the women or the soldiers to its standard.                             III. DISTRICT REPORTS. London.     In  the industrial districts  there can be no  doubt that the  chief subject of discussion during the past week has been that of food supplies, and at Woolwich the discontent  would  appear  to  be  becoming  very  serious.   The Woolwich Co-operative Society has set the excellent example ofv rationing its members in such a way that each member is guaranteed his ration without having to stand in a queue for it.  No new  members  are, however, to be  enrolled as far as provisions  are concerned.     A shop  stewards&apos; meeting was held on Sunday at which it was resolved to take drastic action should no improvement occur.     An interesting innovation is reported from Messrs. Cubitfs engineering works, where after  a  period of frequent  strikes and  disputes, a weekly meeting  is being held by the firm in order to discuss grievances brought forward by the men who are represented by four of their fellows.                    . *               -                    * South- Western.     In this  district,  which, has long been one of  the quietest in the country, there have during the past few weeks been signs of  unrest.  Bristol, the Isle of Wight, and Exeter,  are regarded as the most disturbed  centres, and  it is  thought that a succession of strikes is by no means  improbable.  It has been suggested by responsible trades unionists that the men desire a holiday in order to spend the money they have been accumulating during the past months. West Midlands.     At Coventry and Birmingham  the situation in regard to leaving certificates has been less satisfactory.  There is, apparently, a firm conviction at the back of the minds  of many of the men that the employers are instituting a  system of their own, and are  refusing  to  engage men  who cannot produce a satisfactory certificate showing  the reasons  why  they left  their last  employment.   The men are  very suspicious, and it is  freely said that the Ministries of Munitions  and National Service are ultimately responsible, their object beng to recruit for the army the men  I)who remain out of work during fourteen days.  It is thought that the Departmentsconcerned might with advantage issue a notice setting forth  the position clearlyfor the benefit of the parties concerned.     There  is much unrest among  the  sheet-metal workers  in  this  area owing todelays  which have occurred in dealing with a  wages application made  some four.
months ago.   A deputation of men is meeting the Employers&apos;  Federation duringthe course of this week, and it is feared that a strike may ensue unless a satisfactorysettlement is reached.Yorkshire and East Midlands.    An effort at propaganda work has been made by the U.D.C., I.L.P., and otherpacifist bodies during the past week, but the amount of success seems to have beenalmost negligible.  Mr. Ramsay Macdonald addressed a meeting at Sheffield and Mr.Roden Buxton another at Leeds, but, in the latter case particularly, the audienceswere scanty and not enthusiastic.    On the whole the district remains very quiet.North-Western.    Though conditions  are outwardly fairly  normal in  Lancashire, there wouldappear to be an increasing  amount of unrest under the surface.    An important meeting  of  the  National  Union of  Railwaymen was held inLiverpool on  Sunday, and was attended by delegates from various parts of  thecountry.   The chief  point in  the programme  which was put forward  was thedemand for an immediate increase of a pound a  week in  wages, on the ground ofthe high cost of living.    The question  of food  has  been  much to the fore both in Liverpool   andManchester, though it  is  not  price so much as scarcity which is the cause ofdiscontent.    There is little  faith in the  local food committees which are regarded as thepreserve  of the trader and shopkeeping class, and  there is much criticism  of  asystem which allows supplies to  get  congested in some areas while scarcity reignsm others.    In Liverpool the  withdrawal of leaving certificates has been exceedingly wellreceived, but in Manchester  there is reported to be  very acute unrest. Several unionsallege that the employers have come to an,agreement not to take each others&apos; workers,with the result that many men have become unemployed.   The local delegate of theA.S.E. has  intimated  that if this policy  is persisted in &quot;  every individual memberof the A.S.E. will give their employers notice and leave their work.&quot;North-Eastern.    Conditions are normal  in this  area, and the abolition of the leaving certificateand other measures taken by the Ministry of Munitions have caused satisfaction.    With  regard   to  the  question of combing out the mines, no hostility to theproposed action is reported  to exist among the men, and it  is not expected that therewill be any trouble, provided the men  who have entered the  mines since the beginningof the war are all taken before any of the regular  men.    A meeting of the shop  stewards of the North-Eastern district&apos; was held on the20th October last, and was  addressed by the extremists W. E. Watson and Kealey.The local men refused to accept  the  revolutionary views  of these men,  and thediscussion which ensued is  said to have been exceedingly acrimonious.    A rumour is going about the- shipyards that certain of the firms are cancellingcontracts for standard ships, and entering into new contracts in which these vesselsare described as merchant ships.   The object of this is to  escape the application ofthe recent award as to rates on standard ships.  Should the rumour be substantiatedit is thought that a strike would be inevitable.Wales.    The ballot on the question of combing out the mines is discussed in Section I.Apart from this the  position is normal.    The Chief Investiation Officer  of the Ministry of Munitions in  the Cardiffarea reports that the high price of food is still &quot; the root bottom of trouble &quot; in thatdistrict.  The  working classes  are  convinced  that  profiteering is still going on,despite the assurances of Lord Rhondda,  while it  is impossible to obtain tea, sugar,bacon, and other commodities at the prices fixed by the Ministry of Food.      [1100-2]                              &quot;                        C
Scotland.     Conditions  in Scotland  are normal.    On the Clyde the  I.L.P., C.W.C.,  andI.W.G.B. are all exceedingly active, and the efforts of the one body succeed to someextent in neutralising those of the others.  There is no immediate prospedt of serioustrouble in the shipyards.     The situation among the Fifeshire miners has been considerably relieved by thetransference of many of the men who were unemployed to work in  other  parts  of thecountry.                                   IV. STRIKES.     The  most important strike which has been in progress during the  past week,on  which  involved  8,000  employees of the Midland Railway Company at Derby,arose  out  of  a  demarcation dispute between the Boilermakers&apos; Society  and theNational  Union of Railwaymen.          The general dispute began as long ago as the Trades Union Congress of 1915; the particular      dispute in this case arose out of the alleged persecution of two members of the National Union      of Railwaymen, who  were, employed on boilermaking, by the other men engaged on the same      work, the majority of whom were members of the Boilermakers&apos; Society.    The stoppage      occurred  on  the 23rd October, immediately following a mass meeting of members  of  the      National  Union of Railwaymen,  which wras attended by 2,000 men, and which  resolved that      &apos;&apos; under no circumstances shall we be prepared to resume work until full satisfaction has been      obtained.&apos;&apos;  The mass meeting  was  presided  over  by  an official of the National  Union of      Eailwaymen,  but, official sanction was not accorded, and the strike was denounced by Mr.      J. H. Thomas, M.P.,  Secretary of the Union, who was principally responsible for the eventual      settlement.  After a  meeting with the management of the railway company  on the 25th  he      addressed the men, and succeeded in securing a promise from them that they  would return to      work on  the following day.  They are now  all back at work, and it is understood that  the      Executive Committees of the unions concerned are to  hold a conference with the object of      attaining a modus  vivendi in regard to the general question in dispute.     An important strike involving 4,000 coalminers occurred on  the 24th at Blainain Monmouthshire, owing to the dismissal of certain men for  whom  there was  nolonger any work owing to the closing down of a colliery.  A settlement, the  termsoi which are not  yet known, has, however, been  reached, and the men returned  towork yesterday, the 30th.          Arising out of  the recent strike in Leicestershire owing to a demarcation  dispute between      two  trade unions,  the Leicestershire  Branch of the Derbyshire and  Nottingham Enginemen      and  Firemen &apos;s Union, has been dissolved. There is, however, a possibility of  further trouble.      as the men  are joining the Miners&apos; Union instead  of the Amalgamated Union of  Firemen,      which was the other  party to the dispute.     None of  the strikes which have occurred in munition works are numerically ofgreat significance, and in many cases the causes have been of the slightest character.          Among these may be mentioned a strike of 100 men at York because tea provided by the      firm for breakfast was not ready; a strike of women at Newcastle for the reinstatement of girls      dismissed for wearing trousers outside the works; and  a strike at Birmingham through the      action  of a foreman  in dismissing a man for smoking.   In  one case,  at Liverpool, a strika      occurred, although  the firm had in a letter to the secretary of the union  accepted  the demands      which had been put forward.  The secretary had withheld the information, and the  men had      come out.          About 900 men are  on strike at Messrs. Wrigley and Company,  Birmingham,  but -it is      hoped that a settlement will shortly  be  reached.    The point involved is an  important one,      raising a  question of  general principle, for the men  demand that foremen shall  be  members      of their union (the Amalgamated Society of Engineers).     The  number of women operatives still out of work owing to  the dispute in theUlster linen industry is stated to be 4,000.   A representative  of the  Ministry  ofLabour  has  recently visited  Belfast, and in view of his report it has  now  beendecided to  take steps against the firms which have refused to  accept Mr. VeseyKnox&apos;s arbitration award.                                   V. DISPUTES.     The Committee on Production heard on October 23rd the general applicationsfor increases under the special agreement for the periodical review of wages. About150  representatives of the 48  unions were present, in  addition to all the membersof the Committee itself.   The skilled trades put  in a general application for an
advance of 100 per cent, on pre-war rates.  This, it may be noted, is the same demandas that put forward at the last hearing in July  when a general award of 3s. wasissued.  The Labourers&apos; Union claimed a minimum rate of 50s., and also an advanceof 10s. additional to that of  15s. already granted on previous occasions.   In additionto the general claims the Committee has to deal with the special cases of sixty townswhere it is alleged that the rates  are &quot; unduly low.&quot;     The Committee also heard during the week  other cases for review of  wagesunder periodical  agreements, in  two  of these,  viz., the chemical trades  and theheating and domestic engineers, the arrangements  are on national lines.         The Shipyard Labour  Department reports  180 controversial cases  as having been  in      progress during the last week, an increase of 6.   Of these 50 have been settled, and in addition      there have been 6 cases  of stoppage.         The Clyde area continues to be very disturbed, as many as 102 cases being reported from      that  district.   There have, however, been no stoppages  during the week.   There is, in      particular, unrest among the plumbers who have been concerned in several recent strikes, and      who at the present moment are engaged in a dispute  as to the application of an award issued      by Sir Richard Lodge in August, with which they allege the various firms have failed to comply.      In point of fact, this award has been somewhat  modified by a succeeding one,  and an attempt      is being made by the Department,  with the assistance of the Ministry of Labour, to bring      about a settlement by mutual understanding.                          &apos; -     The Coal Controller&apos;s report indicates a marked improvement  in  the situationin the coal mining industry.         The attempts which were being made to bring  out the men in the  anthracite  district      (referred to in  last week&apos;s report)  have  failed.    The important dispute between the South      Wales colliery examiners and the owners has unfortunately broken out anew.   Notices which      had been handed in some time ago were suspended for a month, pending negotiations on the      questions of wages&apos;and the recognition of the  trade  union&apos;s position.  The employers&apos; offers      have now been submitted to the men, and by  them refused, so that the notices have again      been handed in. &apos; A  final conference was held this week, and it was hoped that the parties      to the dispute would be able to arrange a compromise, but news to-day  (1st November) is that      the settlement has broken down, and the majority of  collieries in South Wales are stopped.         The War Office Contracts Department reports nine cases, four of them for the first time.      Trouble which has been theatening for some time among the jute and flax workers at Dundee      shows signs of coming to a head.   Applications for increased wrages have been put forward by      five unions.   These applications are closely bound up with that put forward  by  the Scottish      Council of Textile Unions,  and as in all cases the work is chiefly of essential military  import-      ance, the Chief Industrial  Commissioner has proposed to send them all forward, in so far as      there is a question of munition work, to the Committee on Production.   The Scottish  Council      has refused to accept the decision, but is to discuss the question during the course  of the week.      Should a strike occur the supply  of sand bags and tenting materials would  be seriously      interfered with.         The Cutlery  Industry  continues  to be restless,  the  general question  of wages advances      being still unsettled.    In the building  trades  the  general Question is one of even greater      difficulty, and a conference has been held in regard to it during the past week at the Depart -      ment of  National Service, at which the employers  and  employees  on  the  Substitution      Committee in that trade were present.     The Ministry of Munitions reports 33 cases of strike and dispute.  This is anincrease by 11 over the number given in last week&apos;s report, and incidently the largestnumber  reported  for some  months.  There  were as  many as 21  stoppages inconnection with these disputes, though in all but three cases the men are now back atwork. Most of these cases are, it is true, trifling as to the numbers involved, and inmany cases as to the cause of the trouble, but in the aggregate they suggest a notableincrease  in  unrest  in the  engineering  trades.   The approaching award by theCommittee  on Production is  causing excitement,  but probably in the  majority ofthese cases  the real  reason for the stoppage is overstrain and the desire for a shortrest, even if it last but a few days.     Among the cases of dispute may be  mentioned one at Messrs.  Armstrong andWhitworth, Manchester, where  a  serious  strike was averted by the dismissal ofcertain negroes, whose  employment was leading to  much bitterness.   The question ofcoloured labour has been,  and is, attracting much attention in various parts  of thecountry, and it might be advisable to make  some definite announcement of  policyon the subject.
