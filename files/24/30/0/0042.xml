The latest decision of the Government  is  that  the  Constituent Assembly is to be held in Petrograd and not Moscow,  and that for the present at any rate Petrograd is to remain the  seat of Government This decision may, of course, be interpreted as a concession to the Sovyet, which was opposed to the transference of the Government to Moscow;  on the other hand, it is more probably  intended as a sign of confidence and of resolution to defend Petrograd at all costs.  Officially the Russian Government refuses to recognise any immediate danger to Petrograd, though  it is admitted that a landing on the coast of Finland might lead, to  a rising of the Finns.   This&quot;ganger was no doubt already faced when the  Government decided to remain In Petrograd.  They may well have thought that it would inspire the Finns with more confidence if no hasty measures were adopted for evacuating the capital.     It is extremely difficult to guess at  German plans with regard to Finland.  Private reports both from Copenhagen and Stockholm speak of active German preparations for a landing on the coast of Finland.  The presence of Finnish revolutionaries in Copenhagen has been reported, and it is further stated that they have  come to confer with German and Danish Socialists.    Heanwhile from Stockholm the Germans are trying to smuggle arms across  to  Finland. It is unlikely that the Germans could  land  any very  large numbersyin Finland,  They will, therefore, prepare  the  way in advance for a rising of the Finns.  The Finns  as a  whole are  a  passive
and cautious people,  in spite of the presence of the Finnishactivists,-  and much will depend upon the attitude of the Russianfleet and the military garrison.  In the early part of theRevolution  the fleet  was thoroughly demoralised, and some of theworst excesses against the officers were committed by the crewsstationed on the Finnish coast.  Lately, however, there has beena distinct  change for the better.   The Central Committee of theFleet, in which the Bolsheviks have hitherto exercised considerableinfluence,  is now working harmoniously with the Minister ofMarine,  v/hile in the  ships themselves the sailors have in manycases asked that their officers should be returned to them.     In Petrograd itself the atmosphere is a little less tense.The Preliminary Parliament has begun well, and has set to workin a businesslike fashion.   In Kerenskifs opening speech, whichwas first submitted for approval to the Cabinet, there was anabsence of  that passionate appeal on which he has hitherto relied.For that .very reason  it suited the occasion better, and seems tohave given the cue to later speakers.   Kerenski himself seems tobe showing greater willingness to be guided by his colleagues,some of whom are certainly strong men.  Both Konovalov and Tretyakov- the latter is an exceptionally strong man - are likely to gainin influence at the expense of Kerenski.   At the same timeTereshchenko - now free from NekrasovTs influence - is stiffening,and is less closely associated with Kerenski than formerly.Kerenski himself will perhaps realise that in the future he mustrely more and more upon the opinions of the moderate elementsin his Cabinet, though his name counts for so much that he maybe regarded for the present as indispensable - indeed, since thedisappearance of Kornilov no one has appeared who threatens todisplace him.
     The absence of political excitement makes greater executive activity possible..  If the Government profits by this period oftranquillity it may do much to weaken the already declining power of the Sovyet.  People are sick of political excitement and, provided the Government shows itself able to act, the appeal of the Bolsheviks will grow less attractive.  The Izvestiya, which is the official organ of the All-Russia (not the Petrograd) Sovyet, admits that among the peasants the influence of the Sovyets Is rapidly declining.  The Sovyet of Petrograd may rage and threaten violence, but if it cannot rely on support outside Petrograd it may v/ell hesitate to come to grips with the Government.  Of course something unforeseen may occur, but it appears more likely that all parties will utilise the next few weeks in conducting their electoral cam- paign for the Constituent Assembly.   To judge from isolated phrases recently uttered by Bolshevik speakers the Bolsheviks are looking forward to the Constituent Assembly as likely to strengthen their position.  No doubt they are judging by the municipal elections all over Russia, the results of which show.large majorities for the Social Revolutionaries, with the Bolsheviks second.  On the other hand, the moderate parties - i.e. Cadets, Radicals and Moderate Socialists - are equally hopeful, and predict the victory of the moderate block,  This would lead to another Coalition Government of much the same character as the present. In view of these circumstances,  therefore, it is quite possible that an open conflict may not arise before the Constituent Assembly. The Kiev Congress of Nationalities.      &apos;     The last batch of Ukrainian papers from Kiev give full reports of the Congress of Nationalities  held there at. the end of September- The leading role was, of course,  played by the Ukrainians,  who pride themselves on having initiated the idea of a federal republic.
21 9professor Hrushevski,  as  stated  in last week1s Report, explainedthat the future  constitution of  Russia should be more or lessmodelled on that of the U.S.A,     At the Congress were present representatives from the CrimeanTatars, the Buryate and the Turks of Turkestan.   They all explained- the Crimean Tatar representatives included women - how far theirseparate cultural movements had  advanced since the Revolution.Greetings were sent from various Mohammedan organisations inTashkent, praying that &quot;Allah would send success to the work ofthe Congress&quot;.     Representatives of the Don Cossacks also spoke.  Though at thebeginning of the Revolution the  Cossacks stood for a united,indivisible Russia, they now favoured the idea of federation, asthey could no longer trust Petrograd.  They also supported thenationalisation of the armies, and in this way they welcomed theefforts that had been made by the Ukrainians to form an army oftheir own.  The Cossacks strongly objected to being used forpolice service,  as work of that kind embittered the  othernationalities against them, and &quot;they would always support thenationalities, in their struggle for freedomj&apos;.   jjlhis speech ofthe Cossack representative is an interesting sign of the changesproduced by the Revolution upon the Cossack soldiers.   Thoughofficially the Cossacks support General Kaledin, the democratic.elements amongst them are growing in influence !J     At the.end of the Congress the following resolutions werepassed:-   (1) That a Standing Council of Nationalities shouldbe formed at Kiev.  (2) That the various nationalities should holdConstituent Assemblies in addition to the All-Russia ConstituentAssembly.  (3) That at the Peace Conference no nation should bedisposed of without its consent, and that Russia should be
represented there by the nationalities concerned in the futuresettlement.  (4) That&apos;national personal autonomy.should be securedfor minorities.  JThis applies especially to the Jews who have noterritorial claimsT]   .     In connection With the question of the nationalities two bitsof information haVe been communicated by Reuter during the lastweek, which show how far the Government is  now prepared to yield:-(1) A special Ministry of non-Russian nationalities is shortly tobe created.  (2) The Ministry of War is reorganising&apos;part of thearmy on the basis of separate nationalities.     Both of these demands have  been repeatedly put forward by theUkrainian Rada.   They are indeed the first step to the federalismthat the Kiev Congress demanded.  The military concessions were atfirst refused by Kerenski.  They are not to be confounded, however,with the demand for a separate Polish army, as the Polish, Ukrainian,Cossack and other units are still to remain an integral part of theRussian army.  In other words, the Polish,  Ukrainian and othernational units are to be in more or less the same  position asScottish, Irish and Welsh regiments ih the  British army,  insteadof forming a separate army such  as that of  Canada  or Australia.29.10.17.
