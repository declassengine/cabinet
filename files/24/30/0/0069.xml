 From:- General Barter,  Russia. To:-   C.I.G.S.,War  Office..     Handed in 9.31 p,.m, 29th 0ct.]$17. &apos;                                 Received 10.45 a.m.  1st Nov.1917. i No.1346.   October 29th.           I received the visit of General Levitski, Chief of   -Military Cabinet of Kerenski, this morning.  He Informed me that Skobillof will  assist at Paris Conference as Government representative and not  from Petrograd Committee which he says is rapidly losing power.          General Golovin, who Is going to Paris as- Military representative, came to me few days ago.   I impressed on him the necessity of being absolutely straight forward as regards situation in Russia and Governments  intention. I promised that arrangements would be made for his comfort&apos; in England and I shall  inform you later probable date of his arrival.   I am informed that real reason for Alexieff&apos;s refusal to go was that  he was expected to make representations and conditions only  in  accordance with instructions.   He did not approve of this,    Levitski this morning in strict confi- dence informed me that  Government intends to form under various names an army of volunteers patriots for restoring  - order but that organization of this force would be kept strictly secret..   This is same scheme as wired you yesterday which was given us by Q.M.G.   He says elections are commen- cing for constitutional     assembly and first sitting will be probably held in last days of November, old style. He asked from himself personally what I thought of possibility of landing a British division at Murman with view to exercising moral pressure on Sweden to prevent her breaking her neutrality.  I replied, if he asked me on the part of Kerenski to sound you unofficially on the subject I should do so, but that there would be great difficulties especially at this time of year,   Levinski is very useful and friendly to us and I would suggest, as soon as possible, bestowing on him C.M.G.     He has had a very distinguished career on the front, where he has been since beginning of war.
