WAGES  AND  PRICES.                     Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.    ATTACHED are two memoranda, one received from Professor Chapman, dealingwith the general question of wages and prices from the economic standpoint,  and theother prepared by the Labour Statistics Department,,showing  as far as possible  whathave been the actual increases in wages  and prices  since the beginning of the war.The general conclusions of these two documents may be summarised as follows :     1. Probably an average increase in wage rates of 50 per cent, on pre-war  rateswould be roughly equivalent to the rise in the cost  of living which has taken  placesince the war, on the  assumption that  expenditure was modified  somewhat to suitpresent circumstances.    In the case of well-paid  workmen  the rise would only  have to be 40 per  cent.,while in the case of the lower-paid  grades of  labour  the  rise  would  have  to be60 per cent.    2. Rises in wages do not affect prices if paid for  by taxation or loans representingrestricted purchasing on the part of the wealthier classes of  the community, but wherethey are met by mere inflation  of the  currency, they tend to increase prices  to anequivalent exlent.    This is illustrated by the fact brought out in the Labour Statistics Departmentsmemorandum that the rise in  wages has followed at a considerable distance behind therise in prices.    3. The average rise in rates of wages is between 35 and 40 per cent., whereas theincrease in the cost of living,  according to the pre-war  scheme of expenditure,  isestimated at 80 per cent.    Th,e increase in the rate of wages  varies greatly between different industries, andin some cases it is smaller among the low-paid grades, who  feel the rise in prices  moreacutely, than  among  the more  highly-ski lied  men, whose margin  is greater.   Forinstance, in the textile trades the increase has only been about 20 per cent, on a baserate  of less than 30s. per week  for weavers, and in the hosiery  trade the  increasehas been 2,\d. in the Is., which is less than 20 per cent. ; the miners, on the other hand,have received advances equivalent to more than  50 per cent., while the iron-ore minersand the blast furnacemen and iron and steel millmen in various districts have obtainedincreases amounting to 70 or 80 per cent, on pre-war rates, mainly under the operationof sliding scales.    4. Employers are  able  to  avoid  feeling the increased cost of labour by raisingtheir  prices in  the  munition trades, while  the  same process is  to  a large extentprevalent in the private industries owing to the restriction of foreign competition.  Inother words, the ordinary economic checks  on rises  in wages have largely ceased tooperate.                           ,    5. The employer can increase his pre-war profits to the  extent of 20 per cent., andeven where he has to pay higher  wages he is still able to earn his additional 20 percent, by raising the prices.    The men  are quite  aware  of this, and  consequently know that if they make stillfurther demands it  will  still not  touch the  employers  pocket, and  that  he willconsequently not be disposed to resist in the way that he would in normal times.    The following extract from a labour paper indicates the effect of the large excessprofits which are being earned on working-class readers :         &quot; A story of steel (careful with the vowels, Mr. Printer!), a story of steel!        &quot; Alfred Hickman (Limited), the Staffordshire  steel firm,  with a capital of    320,0001., has jumped its  profits from 70,067/.  in 1914 to  168,000L in  1915    [1129]                                                              B SECRET.G.T.-2465.
    480,000Z. in 1916, and 600,000Z. in 1917.   There&apos;s a rosy, aU&apos;s-well-with-tLe world,    Dickens&apos; Christmas smile on the faces of the happy shareholders.         &quot;And Messrs. Arthur Wheeler  and Co., the stock and share brokers,  in    advising their clients to buy Hickman stock, say :              &quot; &apos; A large proportion of their excess profits tax has been allowed by the         Ministry to  be  spent  upon  plant, extensions,  &amp;c, so the  position of this         company after the war should be a very happy one.&apos; &quot;    Putting these facts together, the general conclusion would seem to  be that thereis  no limit  to  the  demand for  wages as long as there is no restriction on the rise inprices.  If it is granted that the general rise in wages still leaves the purchasing powerof the average workman  10 or 15 per cent, lower than it  was before  the war, it isobviously impossible to ask him to refrain from making further  demands in order tomaintain his standard of living, as long as he can point to the fact that his employeris not only making the same profit as he was before the war, but  a 20 per cent, largerprofit.  This appears to me to be the root of the  whole  matter, and to indicate that theonly sound method oi&apos; dealing with the situation is by further curtailment  of excessprofits.   If the workman was  assured that] profiteering no  longer existed, he wouldapproach the whole wages question in a very different frame of mind.  Moreover, as ispointed out above, rises  in wages only achieve  their object when they involve atransference of spending power from the wealthier classes to the working classes, andthis is only the case in so far as they are  met by  taxation or by loans,  which implya real restriction on expenditure.  A further reduction of excess profits in order to payhigher wages appears  therefore to be a  sound economic measure, and on the side ofthe workers increased facilities might  be  offered for investment  in  war  savingscertificates, &amp;c, to meet the point made at the  end of the first paragraph of p. 5.    It is argued that any further reduction of profits would make it impossible for thenecessary capital to be saved  which will be required for the period of reconstruction.Clearly the saving of capital for reconstruction purposes ought not to be discouraged,but it  seems desirable to distinguish this use of profits from their use in  increasedpersonal expenditure.   Would it not be possible for the Treasury to earmark a certainsum which would be  available  for capital expenditure after the  war if the ExcessProfits Tax was increased further ?  I  would suggest that the financial position createdby the recent advances should be carefully examined by the Treasury  in connectionwith the question of excess profits.    In the  second  place,  something  could be  done to  remedy the present state  ofaffairs by the introduction of some  clearly recognisable principle  in dealing with wageincreases.  In order to secure  this, however,  much closer co-ordination is necessarybetween the different supply departments and the Ministry of Labour than has hithertobeen the  case.  At the present time the various departments grant increases of wageson no set principle and without any  regard  to  the effect  which  such  increases arelikeiy to  have on the wage bills of other departments.   It seems to me that, if theCommittee on Production adopt a principle based on the rise  in the cost of living, it isessential  that  all the  supply departments should  act  on the same principle, if theawards of the Committee  on Production are going  to be  generally obeyed, and to setthe standard for the country.  This can only be secured by some system by which theMinistry of Labour is consulted  before any important increase of wages is granted byany  department; and unless some machinery, either  by means of a Committee orotherwise, can be devised for  this purpose, I can see no end to the present demands forincreased remuneration.                                                             G. H. ROBERTS.    October 29, 1917.     I. Memorandum by Professor Chapman and Others on the Present Economic                       Positipn as regards Wages and Prices.IP&apos; THE purpose of this memorandum  is to consider  (1) what advances in wageswould leave  the wage-earning  classes unprejudiced, on  the  assumption that theymodified their  expenditure to suit the circumstances of the war, and (2)  whetheradvances in wages  are  causing a general rise  in prices.   The first subject is dealtwith in Part I and the second subject in Part II.
PART I.    The real purchasing power of a   to a typical working-class family has obviouslybeen1 diminished by the rise in prices that has taken  place in consequence of the war.But to determine how much money incomes would have to be increased to make up forthis is no easy matter.  We may be sure, however, that, to this end, they need not beincreased to the full extent of the rise in the cost of the group of things bought by anaverage working-class family before the war.  We may be sure of this for two reasons.In the first place, people naturally substitute the. relatively cheaper for the relativelydearer things in their consumption, and so suffer less than they would have  done ifthey had simply spent the same amount  of money as  before upon the relatively dearerthings and obtained in return a smaller quantity of them.  For  instance,  if coffee gotvery dear and tea did not rise in price, in reckoning the advance in the cost of livingit would be reasonable to  assume  that people would largely substitute tea for coffeewithout expecting an appreciable compensation.  In the second place, some purchasingof things  not immediately  essential  for  efficiency  can be deferred  without muchinconvenience till things are  cheaper again after the war.    What we have to discover, then, as a preliminary step is the percentage of wagesincrease that would  leave people  no worse  off (apart from the  taxation  they areintended to bear), on the assumption that  they substitute cheap  things for  dear to areasonable extent, and keep some of their money to  spend  after the war, when priceswill be  lower, on certain more durable things that they can now. do without at apinch.    The problem is analogous to that of determining how much the real purchasingpower of a   to a family in one district or country exceeds or falls short of what it  isat the same time in another district  or  country.   Let  it be supposed that of thecollection of things which a working-class family in country A are accustomed to buywith their income a   will purchase 10 per cent, less  in country A than it  would  doin country B, and that of the collection which a similar family in  country B areaccustomed to buy a   will  purchase 30 per cent, less in A  than it  does in B.  Inthese  circumstances it would plainly be incorrect to say that the real purchasing powerof a   to a working-class family is 10 per cent, less in A than it is  in  B, and  equallyincorrect to say that  it  is 30 per cent. less.  The  common-sense way of interpretingthe facts  is  to  take the  average  of  these two figures and to conclude that it  is20 per cent.  less. . When we have to compare real purchasing power in the sameplace  between two different times, instead of at  one time between two different places,it is evident that the same  procedure is  appropriate.   It must, indeed, be admittedthat in present conditions the problem is complicated by the  fact  that for a numberof articles maximum  prices have been fixed at a level below what would be requiredto reduce  consumption  equally with  supplies.   Consequently people  find  that theycannot purchase  as much of those commodities as  at  the ruling prices they would liketo purchase.  They  thus suffer a  prejudice greater  than they would suffer if theseprice  levels had  come about  in the ordinary way.  Their position will be equivalentto what it would have been with a  &quot; natural&quot; price  level somewhere intermediatebetween the actual official price level and  the price  level which would have equatedconsumption  to  actual supplies.   Some allowance ought to be made for  this; butprobably at the present time  the allowance need not be very large.  ,; In the monthly report on the  cost  of living  of  the working classes for October,it is estimated as for the 1st  October, 1917, that the increase  from July  1914 to the1st August, 1917, in  the cost of  all  the  items ordinarily  entering  into working-classfamily expenditure,  including food, rent,  clothing,  fuel and light,  &amp;c,  was  nearly75 per cent.,  taking the same quantities and descriptions of the  various items at eachdate and eliminating advances arising from increased  taxation.   This means that of thecollection  of things which a working-class family was accustomed to buy in July 1914a   will buy 43 per cent, less in August 1917 than in  July 1914.    This, however, is only one part of the information we require,  for reasons  alreadystated.  For we do not know the collection of things, which a working-class family isaccustomed to buy in August 1917.  Of course,  this  collection is not the  same as theother  one.  Some prices have risen more  than  others,  and purchases  have  naturallybeen shifted from things that have risen  more towards  things  that have risen less.Furthermore, the actual physical  difficulty of finding certain things (e.g., sugar andcoal)  m the shops will have caused a further  remodelling in the  scheme of purchases.Unfortunately^ however, no statistics are available that  will enable us to determinefrom  direct evidence what the constitution  of the new scheme  or collection  of things
proper to August 1917 is.   We do not, therefore, know to what extent the purchasingpower of a   in respect of it has diminished since July 1914.  The fact, however, thatpeople naturally shift their purchases away from things whose price has risen largelyrather than from things that have been less seriously affected, implies that the price ofthe  1917  collection  must have  risen  less than  that of  the  1914 collection.  Thispoint is brought out by the observation made in the October cost of living report,that,  whereas the  average  percentage  increase  in the  cost of food  to  a typicalworking-class family would be 97 per cent, if the  same articles were purchased as inJuly 1914, the increase would be only 5(5 per cent. &quot; if eggs were eliminated from thedietary, margarine  substituted for butter,  and the  consumption,  of  sugar and  fishreduced by one-half.&quot;  Seeing then that the price  of  the 1914 collection of  the wholebody of things purchased by the working classes has increased 75 per cent.,  it seems anot unreasonable guess to  suppose that the price of the  1917 collection has increased50 per cent.  In this  guess  some  allowance is made for the fact that in 1917 therewere purchaseable  valuable objects,  namely, war-savings  certificates, which wouldyield a high return  if their  value was  spent in later years when prices were lower,which were not  in  existence at all in  1914.   A 50 per cent, rise of prices means, ofcourse, that the purchasing power of a    in respect of the 1917 collection has fallen33 per cent.     On this  basis  the average of  the  two falls in the purchasing power  of a   inrespect  of the  1914  collection, and of the  1917 collection, works out at  less than40 per  cent., and allowing  for the prejudice caused by the limitation  of  supply ofthose things for which maximum  prices are fixed,  40 per cent, may be taken as a  faircommon-sense measure of  the reduction in the real purchasing power of a   since thebeginning of the war to a  typical working-class family.  It therefore appears that  thetypical  family  would  not be prejudiced  if the  rate of  earnings for  substantiallyequivalent exertions were increased by about two-thirds of its original amount.     This  lesult, however, holds only of the average or typical family.  Clearly  thepossibility of saving is less to the very poor than to the well-paid, and clearly the verypoor  are  not in  a  position  to  economise to any  appreciable  extent  by buying  thecheapest necessaries because they buy  them already.  Consequently the best way toput  our conclusions up to this point is to say that the required increases of wageswould scale up from say 50 per cent, at least for the best paid artisans to some figurein the neighbourhood of  75 per cent, for the very  poor, the average or typical figurebeing somewhat nearer the latter than the former.     Nor  does  this correction  leave  us  with  a final conclusion.   For  it  must  beremembered, in addition, both that in  present conditions the  risks of unemploymentare practically  eliminated, so that a given rate  of  wages yields on the  average adistinctly higher rate  of earnings than it used to do ; and also that the opportunity ofearnings for  members of  the typical workm an V family other than the man  are muchgreater than they were. Of  course use  cannot be made of these opportunities withoutwork, and it would  be ridiculous to regard the earnings that they yield  as pure  netgain.  Still, some account  ought, it would seem, to be taken of them.   When this isdone, we may conclude that, if the rate of wfiges for any given class of work  stood nowabout 50  per cent,  (to give a round  number) above what it was in July  1914,  theaverage or typical  family whose principal  wage-earner was engaged on that work,would be as well-situated as it was in  July 1914.  The prejudice threatened by  therise  of  prices that  has occurred since  that time  would in  short be balanced by a50 per cent, rise of wages rates.  Or, distinguishing between  the very poor and best paid,as above, we  may say  that the scale would have to rise from about 40 per cent, for  thelatter to 60 per cent, at least for the former.     It must not be inferred from this  conclusion, however, that a  rise  of  wages of50 per cent, on an average would yield to the wage-earning classes as a whole a normalshare of the product of the country&apos;s economic activities, meaning here and hereafterby &quot; normal share &quot; the share that would be brought to them in the long run by  theoperation  of economic forces under ordinary conditions.  For the  value  in  money ofour productive efforts has  risen by considerably  more than  50 per cent., and there isno reason to suppose that anything has happened to reduce substantially the sharein the result that would ordinarily accrue to labour.  All that our conclusion meansis that if,  in a reasonable degree, advantage were taken of the present opportunities ofgetting employment and making -the  most of  income in spending or investing it, atypical working-class  family  would have little to complain of in comparing its presentwith its pre-war position  (despite the fact that  the family would be doing more workand  would be more  curtailed in respect of  diet and other consumption) provided thatwages rates were about 50 per cent, higher than they were before the war.
                                     PART 2.     These rough estimates having been recorded, we come next to the crux  of  the wages question as it presents itself under war conditions, and  we see  at once  that a practical problem of the utmost  difficulty confronts us.   The nature of this problem can best be displayed in the first instance by a consideration of the  way in  which  the war  has affected the volume of civilian goods actually available for consumption outside the army..  This can, of course,  only be worked out very roughly.  Counting the. men in the army and reckoning three women as equivalent to two men, it appears that  the human  force at work for the community as a whole has, since July 1914, increased by about 18 per cent.  Taking account  of the  relative inefficiency of  many  of the new workers and balancing  this  against  longer hours  of work, we  may put  production, including soldiers&apos; services, at about this amount  above what  it was  ^before the war. We are  also, of course, borrowing a great deal from abroad, but this may be taken as roughly balanced by what we are lending abroad.  Consequently our  actual available real  income of all kinds  of things and services  together (including the  services  of  the army and navy), may be taken at about 120 per cent, of  what it  was  before the war. A very large quantity of this is  devoted to war purposes, and we may take  it that -no more than half  of  it  is  available   for  civilian  use.   Now,  before  the war,  it was  estimated  that the  working  classes  received  in wages  about 40 per cent. of the total national  income, and the other  classes about 60 per cent.   Of course, in view of. the  number of men  withdrawn for the army,  real wages per unit of labour to the present  working classes would  come to somewhat less  than  this 40 per cent.-say 35 per cent. of what the total income used to be before the war.   But even so, if the workpeople are to have for their own  consumption  as much  as this, it would seem that  the other classes cannot have for their  consumption more than, say, a third of the total they used  to  have for  all purposes (including investment in industrial capital)  before the war.   This obviously implies a very large reduction, even allowing for the fact that the  other class before the war devoted about one-third  of their income to the creation of new capital.  Unless, therefore, the other class  contribute to the war through loans and taxation an extremely large amount, it seems impossible that the working classes should receive  as high real wages (that is the things which money wages will buy) as they received before, except  on condition that they themselves devote to the war a considerable part of their wages.  These facts give a  starting point,  for the discussion  of our problem.     Suppose  a large body of people on Government work are given increased wages, then the effect on prices hinges upon whether the money is taken from somebody else (in taxes or loans) or is created in the form of notes or bank advances.   If the former, the spending  of  the increased  wages  takes the place of the  spending of  the money prevented  by  its being  taken  from  other people.  Of course,  the more  taxation is imposed and  the more  people  other than the working classes are  ready and able to contribute to war loans, the more extensively this method can be  used.   But if the other method--the creation of notes and bank balances-is  adopted,  and if  the money paid out  in  increased wages is spent on ordinary consumable things  which  cannot  he- increased,  the prices  of these  things  are pushed  up against  the  people with theincreased;wages and others.   More wages would then  be wanted  as  the advances did:not yield what had  been reckoned upon, and the Government, if they had  to concede them, would have to see that more money was created to pay them  with,  and prices would again  rise, thus  leaving the workpeople  still  unsatisfied.   In the  conditions supposed, this process would clearly continue-raisedwages forcing up the prices of the workman&apos;s goods, and raised prices causing a demand for a further raising of wages.     It is  ;true that a large portion of the w^age-earning class is not in a  position to force an indefinite  rise  of  wages in  this way, since it  is not engaged on  absolutely essential Government work.  If the  number  of  workpeople who are in this position press their.claim far enough, it will be satisfied to some extent at the expense olother would-be  working-class purchasers of the  desired articles, and to  some  extent  by indirectly bringing  about increased  production of these articles.  But there is a limit to the increased  production of these  articles, and ithere is practically a limit,to the extent to which other workpeople can be squeezed, particularly in view of the demand ior labour.at work which is directly.or indirectly essential to -the prosecution of the war.  ; The ^workpeople  who  make  the -civilian &quot;goods whose  price has been ,raised cannot  be squeezed much, if at all, for  when  the people whose  wages  have  been raised force up the prices of what they want to buy, they force up  at  the  same time the wages of the people engaged  directlv  and indirectly  in the production of  these      [1129]                                        *                   0
things, for the high prices make abnormal profits, out of which  higher wages can begot.  Also the workmen engaged in supplying what is needed for Government workare in a favourable position for getting higher wages, and the increased cost can easilybe  handed -on.   It might be objected that a check  would be administered by theimpossibility of financing industries when their costs rose if the Government were notinvolved in the finance. &quot; But there seems to be no present impossibility ; the needfulaccommodation can be obtained from banks apparently, the requisite additional cash,in  the  form of  notes, being forthcoming.   In normal circumstances, no doubt,  thegeneral rise of prices would stimulate imports, check exports, and  cause an outflow ofgold, with the result that banks, finding their reserves  imperilled, would be forced toraise the  rate of discount.  This would check business  generally, lessen  the  moneydemand for  commodities and for labour, and so reduce at once prices, and  the  rate ofwages generally.   In present conditions, however, the  cancelling influence of foreigntrade movements is obstructed by the artificial obstacles imposed  on exportation, andby the special arrangements made for liquidating  foreign debts without resort to gold.Hence, in present  conditions,  a general rise  of prices of the kind described abovemight take place, and react to bring about a further rise of wages.  ;     The contention in this part of the present memorandum,  it must  be clearlyunderstood,  is  not that this process-enforced increase of wage-rates  leading  toenhanced  prices, which  in  turn lead to further demands and concessions of wageincreases is actually taking place now.   The mere fact that prices  have been goingup does not prove that it is doing so ; for there are currency causes  at work both athome and abroad which tend to force prices  upwards,  and increases in  wages justsufficient to make up for a rise in the cost  of  living, due  to these causes  and  not toshortage of available goods, would not set up this process.   The contention is merelythat there are signs which suggest that the process may be taking place now, and that,if the pressure for increased wages continue  to grow, it will almost certainly be set inmotion very  soon.   The  sole preventive is to induce or compel people  to furnishthrough taxation or loans all that the  Government  spends before it spends it.  If itwere feasible  to  pay all  advances on  wages to  people earning more than a certainamount in the form of non-transferable  war  savings  certificates, something in thisdirection would be achieved.II. Memorandum  by the Labour Statistics  Department on the Rise in Cost of hiving                    and in Wa,ges since the Beginning of the War.                                1. Cost of Living.     In the first week of August 1914 there was a sharp rise in the retail prices of theprincipal  articles of food.   On  the 8th August  the  average  increase amounted  to15  per  cent.,  but after  that date there was  a decrease,  and at the  beginning ofSeptember 1914 prices of food were only about 10 per cent, higher  than the normalprices of  July 1914.  By the beginning of January  1915 the average increase hadrisen to 18 per cent.  The increase in the prices of other items of family expenditureup  to this date was relatively unimportant, and the average percentage advance  in&quot; all  items&quot;  (including food, rent, clothing, fuel, and  light, &amp;c.) at  the 1st January,1915, was 12 per cent.     After a year of  war, at  the beginning of August 1915, the average increases forfood  and  for  &quot;all items&quot; were 34 and 26 per cent  respectively;  a year later thecorresponding figures were CO and 47, and at the beginning of August 1917 they were102 and 79, a  further 4 per cent, being added to these figures by the 1st September.     Since then there have been important reductions in the prices of  flour, bread, andmeat, but  some other articles have become dearer.  It is difficult  to estimate what willbe  the net effect  of all the  changes, but at the 1st October the average increases forfood and &quot;all items&apos;&apos; respectively were estimated at 97 and 75 per cent.     The following table shows the average increase since July 1914 in the retail pricesof food and in the cost of &quot;  all items &quot; at the beginning of each month  since  the warstarted :                                                              :;

From  1 December 1:14  to May 1915 there was a fractional difference between the percentagesincluding and excluding increased taxation, which was insufficient to affect the whole numbers shown.     In  arriving at the percentage increases given above, regard  is had  to the relativeimportance of  the various items in  pre-war family budgets, and the figures representa statistical comparison of prices  at  the various dates.

During  the early months  of  the war there was  little change  in  rates  of wagesgenerally.   About the end  of 1914, however, a rise in the cost of food and  clothing,combined with which was ah increasing shortage of labour, led to a demand for higher       [1129]                                                                 D
wages, and in February 1915 a sharp upward movement began, the advances largelytaking the form of war bonuses or special increases limited to the period of  the war.The industries first affected were  mostly those concerned  with the  manufacture ofmunitions and the transport trades; but the movement subsequently spread to all theimportant industries.     Following on the continued rise in the cost of living applications were made andin many industries repeated  at intervals  more or less  frequent for revisions of the&quot;bonuses&quot; or &quot;war wage&quot; advances granted.   In most cases such applications havebeen so  far  successful&apos; that the first bonuses or war advances  have  since  beenconsiderably  augmented, and. though the  amounts now being paid vary very widelywith different classes of  workpeople and in different districts the cases in which somesubstantial amount is not being paid must  be few and insignificant.     The great variation referred to renders it difficult  to express  the amount of  warwage by  means of averages.  For example, in the engineering and shipbuilding tradesand in railway service there is a general war  wage  advance of 15s.&apos;:;:&quot; per week on thetime rates of men, irrespective of  age  or occupation,  and  the  percentage  increaserepresented by this figure is obviously very much less with  skilled  men,  e.g., fitters,platers, and engine drivers, at pre-war rates of, say, 40s.  or 50s.  per week than withpartly-skilled men, such as many  classes of machine attendants,  engine firemen,  &amp;c,rated at,  say,  25s. to 35s. per week, and still more so with unskilled  labourers at,  say,20s. to 25s. per week.     In a few cases the increases given during the war are either roughly equivalent to,or not far short of, the increase in cost of living.   Among these may  be mentioned  ironore miners in Cumberland and blastf urnacemen and iron and steel millmen in variousdistricts, whose wages have risen frequently by 70 or 80 per cent, on pre-war rates, mainlyunder the operation of sliding scales, in accordance with the selling prices of  iron andsteel.  Coal miners also have received advances of between 30 and 50 per cent, in theprincipal districts,  and in  addition an advance of Is.  Qd. per  shift  has just  beenarranged, which,  with the percentage referred to, will make the rise in wages little lessthan the  rise  in cost of living.  The case of unskilled  labourers in engineering shopshas already been referred to ; in many cases, where the rate was not more than 20s. perweek at July  1914, the war wage of 15s. means an increase of 75 to 80 per cent.     Such cases,  however,  are only a minority.   In  the  building  trades the usualincrease for men has been, from 2d. to 2\d.  per hour (say, 8s.  to 10s.  6d5. per week); inthe textile trades it has been about 20 per cent, on piece rates in the  cotton industries,40 per cent, on piece rates and 50 per cent, on time rates in  the woollen and  worstedindustry, 2\d. in the Is. (less than 20 per cent.) in the hosiery trade, Ils. to   15s.  perweek in the bleaching, dyeing, and  finishing industry, 12s. per week in the  Belfastlinen trade,  and 30 per cent, to  carpet  weavers.  Boot and shoe  operatives imen)have had 8s.  to 10s. per, week, in addition to  new general piece lists for Governmentwork, giving  varying increases in different districts.  In the printing trade there arevariations in the principal  centres from  7s. or 8s.  per week up  to 11s. 6d. or  13s.per week; cabinet makers have had l^d. to 3^d. per hour;  bakers, 10s. to 15s. or  16s.per week ; carters, 7s.  or 8s. per week up to 14s.  or  15s.  per week ;  dock labourersfrom 2s.  or 3s. per day up to 4s. per day.   In agriculture the establishment recently ofa minimum rate of 25s. per week has resulted in considerable increases in some of thelower-paid districts, and there have also been substantial, though varied, advances indistricts  in which wages were already above that amount.     Taking all industries together, the increases  in rates of wages would appear torange, in the  great majority of cases, from about 20 per cent, up to 60 or 70 per cent.,and even 80  per  cent,  in a few instances,  the average  being  probably  in  theneighbourhood of 35 to 40 per cent.     This figure, of course, is much below the average increase in cost of  living, whichis estimated at about 75 per cent., exclusive of the  extra taxes on tea, sugar,  &amp;c,  andit is evident that, if consideration were given only to  the rates of wages paid for thesame work, the great bulk of the working classes would appear to be in a much worseposition than before the war.     In addition,  however, to the &quot;war bonus&quot; and &quot;war wage&quot; increases in  rates ofwages referred to above, various other factors  have  combined to increase the totalweekly earnings  during the war.  In the first place, employment  generally is nowmore regular than before the war, the percentage of trade union members unemployed,as shown by the  statistics regularly collected by the Department, having fallen frombetween  2 and 3 per cent, in 1914 to 0\5 per cent, at the present time.   And not onlyare unemployment and  compulsory short time, with consequent loss of earnings,  less    * Since increased to 11. by an award issued by the Committee on Production on November 6,  1917.
 frequent: the severe shortage of labour has resulted in a great increase of overtime, night work, and Sunday work,&quot; which are paid for at more  than ordinary rates.  There has  also been an  extension  of  systems  of payment  according to  output,  which, combined with  extra  pressure  on, and fuller  employment of,  piece-workers,  has tended to increase earnings considerably.  In  addition, there has been  a widespread transference of workers from low-paid occupations to  others  in which the wages are higher, and there has also been an increase in  family earnings in a large number of cases owing  to  the  increase in the numbers  of wage-earning women  and girls in consequence of the demand for labour to replace men who have joined  the army.     It is not possible, from any available statistics,  to estimate  the  amount  of the increase in  family incomes resulting from the combined operations  of all these factors; but there can be no doubt that in  many cases it has been very great, and that their total effect must have been to add very considerably to the  average  increase of between 35 and 40 per cent, recorded in rates of  wages.     It is, however, extremely improbable  that the increase, in total earnings is more than double  the increase in rates of wages, as it would require to be if it were to be made commensurate with the increase in cost of living.     In the  light of all the  available information, it  would  appear that  there is a substantial  minority  of the manual labour population which, by reason of war bonuses and  increases in rates, added to the various other causes of increased earnings, is in as good a position as, or perhaps better than, before the war; but for the majority of the workpeople the increase in earnings has  not kept pace with the rise in the cost of living, and  real wages, on  the  average,  are still  appreciably lower than in the first half of 1914.    The  foregoing  statement of the facts merely shows that a readjustment of money wages has  been going on with a view to the workers being paid in goods as much as before the war.  In spite of the active demand  for labour, which of course operates as well as the  rise in prices, and  in spite of the  extra time worked by  many  of the operatives, this readjustment is  not yet complete. It may be argued that the work- people must reduce their standard of living as a result of the war, but as that standard was  not very high even in peace times it seems to be dangerous in the  interests of our future national life to do anything to  enforce  that view.   On the contrary, I am of opinion that the readjustment of wages must go  on in order to maintain, if not to raise,the pre-war standard.
