T. -2467 vi A R   0 A B I U S T4THE SITUATION IK IRELAND,         Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.      I append hereto representations which I have received  during a recent period from the G.O.C. in Ireland (Sir Bryan  Mahon) and the Under Secretary at Dublin (Sir Vi. P. Byrne)  with regard to proceedings which have been ta en sinco July  14th last and others which they think could be  taken  to mend  the condition of Ireland.      Sir Bryan Mahon&apos;s letter of October 5th 1917, was the  first of these communications and is in the terra following:-                                      Headquarters,                                         Irish Command,                                            Par legatee,                                               Publinw.                                          5th October, 1917.       Sir,               The state of affairs in this oountry has lately       undergone a change which renders it, in my opinion,       nocossary to report to you on matters which affect the       Military situation and also the administration  of. the       Defence of the Realm Act and Regulations.               Tho instructions contained in your memorandum.       No. 15115 of the 14th July last have been carefully       followed, subject, however, to tho limitations  which       have become necessary owing to political  expediency.       This aspect of tho question is ono on which.the Mili-       tary Authorities must act on tho directions of  the       Civil Executive.          2.&apos;    The death and funeral of Ashe have resulted       in an outburst of popular sympathy, of 7/hich theI      . utmost use has been made by the Sinn Fein leaders,       ,ln all i)srts of the country.       Rebel uniforms have been worn by many persons in public,       arms have been openly carried in processions, and there&apos;       is every indication of careful organisation of  the dis-       loyal and dangerous elements.  These facts furnish       evidence of the condition of the country  and arc con-       fira.dby the reports of my Intelligence Officers in the       Districts, particularly in the Southern District which      . is reported to be in a most unsattsfactory state.
These recent &quot;breaches of the Regulations have beentacitly permitted, and open defiance of the lawis likely to continue unless firm measures are againinstituted which are, in. my opinion, particularlynecessary in cases of organised drilling, carryingarms, the wearing of uniform of a military character,and speeches containing direot incitement toimmediate violence.It is impossible to forecast the results which mayaccrue from the amelioration of the treatment ofoffenders /nils in prison,  tut it is not unreasonableto afesume that further attempts may be made to forcethe hands of the Government, and that such attemptsmay even take tho form of demanding release.It is to be remembered that one of the aims andobjects of the Sinn Fein movement is to embarrasstho Government to the greatest extont possible.  3.    The dangers which may arise from tho mili-tery point of view appear to me to be as follows:-     (1)  An organised passive resistance            against Government.This a parse of notion has been constantly hinted atby De Valera end other leaders of the Sinn Feinmovement in the course of their speeches.   Theorganisation of this Party is becoming moreperfect, and their followers are exhibiting dis-ciplino to a remarkable degree which is perhapsthe mcst dangerous sign of the times0  As instancesof this, I would refer to the recent by-elections,where disturbances were prevented by the action ofthe Sinn Joiners themselves., and also to thefuneral procoscion of Thomas Ashe. which v/asattended by a vast and highly organised processionof ten to fifteen thousand people entirely outsidethe control of the Police,   A passivo resistancemovement is, in my opinion,  the greatest dangerwe have to face-.  It.might include a Railway strikewhich would most seriously affect the military situa-tion, as regards the movement of Troops and thecarriage of munitions.     (2)  Spasmodic outrages on Munition Works,            Government stores and buildings.Sabotage is always a possibility in Ireland, andthe likelihood of such occurrences oe these Isonly increased in the light of recent events.Armed Guards are provided on vulnerable points, butthese measures cannot bo regarded ss affording com-plete protection.     (3)  Armed rebellion.This danger is, I consider,  unlikely to occur unlessan  enemy landing is effsetefc - nevertheless it is apossibility should a collision occur with the armedforces of the Orownj  I am satisfied that the :preparations which have been made to deal with any
armed rising are adequate for the purpose.  4.    I now desire to refer to the administration ofthe Defense of the Realm Act and Regulations. -Under the Government instructions referred to in para-graph, lo of this letter.  29 portions have been triod byCourt Martial for of ionics against the Drilling Order,and 5 persons for making speeches inciting to violence.These trials have apparently had a good effect in mostoarts of the country in acting,as a deterrent, but itis an undoubted fact that they tend to embitter thecountry and render more probable the dangers to whichreference has already been made.  This is/a measureduo to reports in the newspapers read.by this class ofperson, whichj in endeavouring to provide acceptablematter, invariably put forward distorted versions ofincidents whija occur.,  The true facts and the Govern-ment views are rarely brought to their notice.If the general practice in future is to give FirstDivision or similar treatment to persons sentencedto imprisonment by Court Martial, these Courts maylose much of their effect and will become despisedas well as ha ted *   It would, therefore, appeardesirable to limit Counts Martial JOB far as possibleto offences for which amelioration.of treatment isinapplicable, if other measures can bo adopted fordealing with other cases.  50    The difficulties of the situation are accen-tuated by the fact that Courts Martial are, in nearlyevery part of Ireland, the only possible Courts forthe trial of contraventions of the Defen&amp;j of the RealmRegulations, while many of these offences are of aminor character, often the result of mere bragadCecio,and, therefore, unsuitable for trial by this method.It is to be regretted that there is no Other tribunalat which an imparta .1 hearing of such offences canbe obtained,  It may here be noted that Courts-martialcannot hold to bail, a fact which furnishes additionalargument against the trial by them of minor offences.  6.    Difficulty has also lately arisen in trials forviolent speeches.   The Police witnesses have only beonable to produce mental notes which have been committedto writing after the conclusion of the-, meetings.  Thishas proved unsatisfactory as regards proof.  1 *    Ho proceedings have yet been taken against theleaders of the Sinn Fein movement, though many of therank and file have been tried for various offences,principally for drilling.  This has caused irritationin the country and has; given additional influenco tothe leaders, who consider themselves immune fromhindrance .in their activities.  There appears to belittle prospect of improvement in the situation whilethis feeling continues, and I therefore desire tobring again to your notice for consideration thenecessity for some action being taken againstMessrs. De Valera, L. Ginnell, Darrel Figgis, JohnMilroy, Arthur Griffith, Madame MarkiovicZj and otherprominent extremists.
Such action need not necessarily lead to trial orimprisonment, tout might take the form of deporta-tion or internment^1  8.    The possession of &amp; large number of arms bythe Ulster Volunteers is a source of irritation tothe National Volunteers whoso arms were latelyseized.&apos;  The pretext of seising these arms does not 4--exist in the case of Ulster as it is unlikely thatthey will get into/aesirable hands, though a coupde main by tho Sinn Fein Party for the seizure ofsome of them is riot impossible.It is also recognised that, the risk; of the stop-page of work in the Munition Factories in the Northprevents the taking of these arms by force.  Theonly solution appears to be an arrangement by whichthey would be voluntarily surrendered to tho Mili-tary Authorities for safe custody.  9.    In conclusion I beg to append for yourinformation a table showing the numbers of casesin which persons have been imprisoned under sen-tence by Court3-martial, during two periods -     A. 12 months from 14th July, 1916 - 14th July, 1917,     S.  2  months from 14th July, 1917, to 1st October,           1917,In this connection I dasiro to state that since -therelease of tho Rebel prisoners on 16th June, 1917, Imyself, and the Competent Military Authorities actingundar me,  have determined to take no proceedings underthe Defence of the Realm Regulations in many caseswhich would unquestionably havo been tried by Courtsmartial a year ago.                      I have the honour to be,                             Sir,                         four obedient Servant,                 (Signed)   B* MAHQN.

After the House of  Commonskte of October 23rd I received a further letter  from Sir Bryan inkh he said                                                                erastopped,  rod of course,  the longer it is allowed to continue the  -more dangerous it becomes.me,s i    There have also been several very bad spoeches come to out I have taken no notice of speeches pending a decision  ai regards how the leaders are to be dealt with or if they are to be taken notice of&quot;.

(Signed), .B.MAH0N.          Dublin.-          29th Oct. 1917.     I also  received on Oct. 31st  tho following letter  i-                                       Headquartersi Irish Command                                         Parkgate,  Dublin *                                       30th October, 1917.          My dear Mr.Duke,                        I am  quite convinced  that ourtpresent          mothods or by bringing beforo the  JLM.  and binding to          good behavour for 12 months will not stop  drilling or          wearing of uniform nowi              The only measure I  can suggest  is the arrest and          deportation out of Ireland of the  leaderst I think          there  would Have To  be 15e owe en.140 and 130 arrests, uhon          this is donee  I think the question  con thus  bo effect-          ively  dealt uith but not otherwise,   Dispersing the          parties drilling by  the  troops  I  do  not advise  except          as a last recourse,,  as it Trill  mean  bloodshed.-   It          would  be 7/orso then  useless employing troops  in any          half measure way.              I really think  the  time has  arrived for  some          strong measures to bo taken.  Clemency has been given  a          good trial and without satisfactory  resultsi                Yours very sincoroly,                        (Signed).. B.MAH0N.     Meantime I  had continued  to give directions  as  to  currentadministrative questions on tho lines laid  down by the  docisionof the War Cabinet in July and in  the discussions union took placoin the War Cabinet on 0cto23rd and 0ctv24th, before  and after thoDebate in the House of Commons.  I have also called  for and havesinco receivod particulars of  such proceedings of the individualmembers  of the new Sinn Fein organization as v/ould have to  boconsidered if it became necessary  to docido  whether  they  or  any  ofthem should  be placed under arrests   On  tho balance of the  variedconsiderations involved,. I come to the conclusion that  I  ought to                                                  ezerciso
 erciso tho discretion loft to me by the War Cabinet on Oct.24th7 refraining at the moment from my such arrest, or arrests.   Thebsonce of any directions in this respect appears to have been  thetuse which elicited from the Under Secretary the followinginuto which reached me on Sunday., October. 23th.        Chief Secretary:                       There arc a considerable number of  cases   of drilling, often in uniform, of a serious charactor which   are now under &quot;consideration and Sir Bryan Liahon reports that   this offence has been increasing and seems likely to in-   crease-&quot; Ho has before him some 17 or 20 serious cases  which   will-apparently result in convictions end smart sentences.   Some of them have already boon submitted to you.  The:General   Officer Commanding in Chief,has been proceeding on the  linos                                                    ibjoct, ofthe drilling was military efficiency and organisation.  Thisseems to be&apos; the only course that is in accordonco with thewishes of Government as expressed in the House of Commons -last - Tuosday.havo no sense of security, here until tho leaders and thomore nromin^it orramis.brs^andjxrd tators&quot;&quot;arp put of&quot;Irolrnd.and - safely intornocT aero ss tno QEannoTT     \o\x arc no doubt in possossion of the views of theIrish Convention on tho subject of action against seditionwit it is hard to bcliovo that those viows nave not boon modi*fiod nowt that Sinn Fein has becoxmo oponly a treasonableassociation with which no Constitutional party couldconfessedly ally itself,  I cannot help fooling that if-tho Irish Convention cannot take up the attitude that it isan Assembly of Irishmen seeking a bettor Government of theirCountry; on Constitutional lines, and having no truck with, ordependence-on traitors,  it is not likely to arrivo at anyresult.                                               &apos;-/.                    (Intd.) -Wo. Pt B..27th October, 1917.
I responded &quot;by an inquiry &quot;What is the exact nature of theaction suggested, who are the persons involved,  and when isit suggested action should take place?&quot;   The Under Secretaryreplied in the Minute appended hereto, dated Oct. 30th,  1917,which was accompanied by the annexed paper headed &quot;Declarationof Government Policy&quot;.MINUTE BY UNDER SECRETARY TO DUBLIN ADDRESSED          TO CHIEF SECRETARY.           My note of Saturday 27th instant was not in*tended as a definite proposal for immediate action butas a submission to you of the difficulties in executiveaction which we encounter in endeavouring to give effectto the Government declaration of policy in Parliament lastweek, and a suggestion that a certain course - viz: re-moval from Ireland and internment - might at once orpresently be found the best resource.           The executive difficulties are:     (i)   the considerable number of cases which will           have to be dealt with by Courts Martial           even if all trivial cases are discharged           without trial:     (ii)  the unsatisfactory situation of the CM.A.           in having ta punish the small fry while           the major offenders are left alone; and     (iii) the unsuitability of imprisonment as a mode           of dealing with these offenders.           (a)  In many cases detention, and not                  punishment, is what is needed.           (b)  The relaxations of prison discipline                  which have, to be allowed upset the                  whole Prison system and the discipline                  of the Staff.           (c)  The relaxations are difficult to give                  effect to in an ordinary Prison, and                  are sometimes such as are needed to                  bribe the prisoners into good be-                  haviour and to satisfy Visiting                  Justices who are not over-wise or                  over-loyal, and not such as the Prison                  Authorities themselves regard as                  desirable -           (d)  With such Visiting Committees and such                  a Press as exists in Ireland,  relaxa-                  tion tends to mean anarchy or govern-                  ment&quot;bythe prisoners themselves.  In                  an internment camp such government                  could be largely admitted.
          (e)   Imprisonment involves questions of                    forcible feeding and the use or                    the Cat-and-Mouee Act which in                    this ill-formed and excitable Country     t               always raise trouble.          (f)   Internment would give the offenders                    what they ask for - &quot;the treatment                    of prisoners of war&quot;.  I believe                    they would hate it when they got                    it, but in Great Britain they                    would get no more sympathy than do                    the conscientious objectors, and                    would have to grin and boar it,                    instead of succeeding in weakening                    the Government, as they do here.  If a policy of internment were found expedient, I wouldsuggest that.it should be applied forthwith to some tenor twelve of the leaders including De Valera, Ginnell,Father 0&apos;Flanagan, Plunkett, Stack, Figgis, Markievicz,Milroy, and several others, men and women, but notGriffith or MacNeill.  Also at once to some 20 or moreof the leading and persistent drillers and organizers,and afterwards individually to each fresh offender ashe was brought to book.  They might soon amount to 120or mere.  You have all their names and careers in thepapers which have been prepared for you.  Such a step would, of course, raise the cry - &quot;Whatabp,ut the Convention?&quot;   You have better opportunitiesthan I have of forming a judgment on this point.  ButI think that the rocks on which the Convention may split -quod Deus avertat -  are three : -     1.   A considerable rebellion of any nature, or            open obstruciion of the law in Ireland;     ii.  The refusal of the Unionists and the loyal            minority to hand themselves over to a            country in which disloyalty was wide-            spread and unchecked;  and     iii. The desertion of the &quot;County Council Party&quot;            through sympathy with, or fear of, or            anxiety to get the votes of, the Sinn Fein            organization.  Of these dangers I think the last is the least likelyto be realisofi: bull ioy knowledge is very imperfect.  It would of course be quite, possible, notwithstandingthe emphatic declarations of the Prime&quot;Minister, to goon with  the policy which we have been carrying on underyour directions after  the Cabinet Conference .  But Ibelieve  this would subject us to the danger.--- notindeed of a formidable military rising-.-- but ofsuch extensive and well-planned organization of a semi-military character against the Government as wouldendanger the enforcement of law, distress the loyalpopulation, and discourage the Police, conceivably inthe long run sapping their discipline.   Internment wouldpossibly involve  an amendment, of the D.R.R. , and thiswould be the case eventually if the policy adopted were
(Intd)   W.P.B.   30th October,  1917,removal to England followed by internment in the caseof misbehaviour.  The reasons justifying removal are those set out inthe first jinee of D-R,R^ 14:- and these reasons wouldjustify internment also, i  internment were foundhecessary to bring to an end the agitation carried onby the offenders,  it might be argued that &quot;hostileassociations&quot; within the meaning of D.R.R. 14 B couldnot be held to be proved in the case of Sinn Eeinersnotwithstanding their adoption of the Irish RepublicanProclamation with its reference to &quot;foreign allies&quot;.If so, the Regulations would require amendment.  Deportation, if adopted,  should be carried outsuddenly,  and as sodn as the Government is satisfiedthat it is an advisable course.
                - 11 -ANNEXE TO UNDER SECRETARY&apos; S MI MITEDECLARATION OF GOVERNMENT POLICY.The Chief Secretary used the following words;   &quot;The criminal opinion which aims at secession by    force out of the British Empire.&quot;After giving instances of arming and drilling he.said:-   &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government will,  to the best of    their power, prevent and stop criminal acts of    the kind.&quot;   &quot;While, as we hope,a new Constitution for Ix-eland    is in the making, and while great masses of    Irishmen are inspired with the  same hope, then    no matter what the extreme character of the poli-    tical controversy, if we can keep it within    bounds and reconcile it with safety, there shall    be no arrest which can properly be avoided.    Nothing would have been more helpful to this pro-    paganda cf rebfellion than that  we should have    embarked on wholesale arrest of everybody who was    concerned.  There have been no  arrests except in    the case of people who incited  to violence or    took part in deliberate or determined infringc-    ment of regulations intended for the public safety    There will be no arrests,  so far as I am con-    cerned,  except within those narrow limits.&quot;    The PRIME MINISTER said that, in his opinion, De Valerns utterances were plain,  deliberate and cold-blooded incitements to rebellion.    He laid down three essentials of policy -         i.   incitements to rebellion cannot be             permitted:        ii.   marching in streets and drilling in             Ireland means rebellion. &quot;Organisa-             tion for rebellion must be stopped.&quot;       iii.   The Sinn Feiners are organising rebel-             lion for sovereign independence. &quot;It             is better that we should say at once             that under no conditions can this             country possibly permit anything of that             kind&quot;.         Within three day3 the Sinn Fein Convention    adopted a Constitution which, basing itself on the    Proclamation of a Republic at the Easter rebellion,    set forth as the main objects of Sinn Fein organi-    8ation:-       (1)  to deny the right and oppose the will  of            the British Crown and Parliament as ex-            pressed in legislation;
                 (2)    to make use of  any  and  every means  avail-                       able to render  impotent the  power of                       England to hold Ireland in  subjection by                       military force  or otherwise.                 In pursuance of this policy, De Valera,  a  few             days later at Bailieboro,  said:-               &quot;The Sinn Fein leaders  are  all  out  for inter-                 national recognition of a  free and  independent                 Irish Republic,  They  would use any methods                 and means which were in. accordance  with the                moral law and the will of  the  Irish people.                 They had a perfectly legitimate right to seek                 to attain their freedom by force of arms if a                 suitable opportunity presented itself.   They                 had a moral right to arm and defend themselves                 (against Conscription).  Physical force  was                not morally wrong.&quot;  The course I have followed during the days since  the  House ofCommons Debate has been to keep informed by postal reports andalso by information telegraphed daily whether the leaders of theSinn Fein movement are accepting the warning given them  in  theHouse of Commons,  or whether they or any of thejc committed actswhich left no alternative but to arrest him or  them.   I  am  toldfrom various quarters that restraint is being shown.   I  am  notsure as to this, since nothing very definite has occurred.   Asmatters stand, however, I have learned separately from  the Lord-Lieutenant, the Attorney General, the Solicitor General,  and theAssistant Under-Secretary,  that they individually think  it  wouldnot be wiso to take the steps described in  the  memoranda  of theCommander-in-Chief for the Under Secretary.(Initialled)   H.E.D.ist November, 1917
