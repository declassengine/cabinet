(This Document It the Property cf1Hit Britannic Ma]esty&apos;t Government.)Colonel Jones\MiGeneral Delme Ra&amp;oliffe.  Italy.G.I.&apos;G.SWar Office.Handed in 31st 0otober,1917.         2.40 a.m.6 E CB E T.Received 7.0 a.n.528,  30th October, 1917.      Position this evening is as follows .:-      3rd Army is continuing to cross Tagliamento.There is a good deal of confusion among troops and transportcolumns on the road and also liability to panic.  EightBritish howitzers when nearly across the river were abandoned,as the drivers, becoming scared, cut the traces and departedwith horses.      2nd Amy seems to have degenerated into a mob andthere is great confusion about bridgehead near Sant odoricoand Oodroipo.  It appears that about 60 yards from SantOdorico the bridge is destroyed but enemy is endeavouringto repair it though he is being held off for the presentby artillery and machine guns on right bank.   GeneralDi Giorgio!s detachment is in position near Pinzano wherehe is being joined by part of Carnia force retreatingunmolested and by their detachments under General Badoglicand General Petiti.       It appears that one of the bridges west of Oodroipowas blown up too soon,this adding to confusion on the furtherbank where enemy is beginning to press.       Some enemy aeroplanes have dropped bombs on massesof transport and vehicles accumulated near bridges on far sideof river.   Morale in 3rd Army seems to be diminishingconsiderably; also troops wouia require some days to recoverfrom the fatigue, hunger and exposure,also confusion ofthe retreat,before being fit to fight effectively, evenif they have the wish to do so.  It is impossible not tohave doubts about this.Commando
          Commando Supremo has  changed Its mind againconcerning destination of French Divisions which I understandwill new concentrate around Brescia as the Italian Divisionsfrom 3rd Army, intended to cover Giudicaria gap, could not hegot there for several days yet.          There are about 240 guns now in position onthe right bank of the Piave which is fordable at allseasons, but owing to lack of morale in some units, the greatconfusion also lack of cemmunications and control, it isuncertain that an effective defence will be made onthis line*    If the enemy refrains from pressing at allorder may be restored to some extent but it must be expectedthat enemy pressure will now increase considerably,          It is hoped ten serviceable divisions may becollected to take up the line of the Piave but thismay prove too sanguine an estimate.
