Colonel Jones10 463(This  tecyroiiit it the Pmmriy ofHit Irjtannfc Majettyyt Government.)248&apos;s sGRIT,From:- C.I*G.S0/  Rome.To:-*Secretary of State for War,- LondonHanded in 11,20 P.M. 1.11.17,Received   6.5  A.M. 2.11,17.R 6. Secret.     I have seen Sonnino who says  energetic and firm measureswill be taken at once and that country has behaved muchbetter in recent circumstances than he had feared it might.He seems satisfied that it can be  held together providedno further great disaster occurs-.   As I have already explained,this depends mainly on the Italians themselves as matters willbe largely decided during the next fortnight.  New War Ministeralso assures me order shall be restored in the Army and he assertsthat country may be trusted&apos;.   My  difficulty Is to reconcilethis view of feeling in the country with hard fact of thedisappearance of the 2nd Army and  both Ministers admitted feeling-same difficulty.   I showed Ambassador my R 5 and he too holdscountry has behaved well and is not as lukewarm as I havesuggested.   He also, disagrees with me in regard to unpopularityof French and- ourselves.   It is right that War Cabinet shouldknow this and I cannot, of course, set up any opinion againsthis-. / At the same time Rome is very distant from the theatreof War and I cannot account for 2nd Army situation except byattributing It  to country and no one has  been able yet to accountfor it otherwise.
