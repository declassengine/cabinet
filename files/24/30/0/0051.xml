TO cabinet.        &quot;possibilities  as  to &quot;aircraft production in ^,               THE -UNITED  STATES OF  AMERICA.(Telegram  from Lord  Northcliffe. Received 51st October,  1917.)53982.  Lord Northcliffe requests following be transmitted toC&apos;i  J. Phillips for War Cab me b,  Derby,  Cowdray and GeneralTrenchard:-.   No. 464.  Stop.  In viw of the requests I have had forparticulars of exact situation as to Aircraft /production inthe United States I send t.ne following estimate,  which Ihave drawn up after visits to the great factories of Detroitand Dayton.  Stop,  Sqaier.  Howard Coffin and Deeds, thethree loading organisers of those wonderful factories,  saythat If^the - 3r.i ti-sh - Government is of opinion that Aircraftis  important in the&apos;war and will say so emphatically, to thePresident they will be. in a position- to turn out planes asrapidly as motor carts are produced here,  and it should berealised that one factory alone issues over 5,000 cars a day.Stop.  The possibilities as to woodwork in such furnjturecentres as Detroit; Grand Pap.&apos; da and Southbend are practicallyunlimited.  Stop.  I would ash jhgs^cone e. rned. to give carefulatteny^pjn^to th^reporyT&apos;  5!&apos; opI am bringing further infor-mation with me, but the fol?.cwing is the result of many weeksinvestigation in the United states, and of close study ofAircraft since 1908.  Step,Begins ....   (l)  It is necessary to realise that the huge aeroplanepreparations which are be3 ng trade in the United Statescannot materialise into aeroplanes actually fighting againstthe Germans in France to any preponderating extent in thespring campaign of 1918.  Stop.   (2)  It is considered that production of the Liberty motorcannot begin until three months hence,  say 1st. February.Stop.  The output  of tested Liberty motors may therefore bea3 follows               February        480               March         1.080               April         l]500               May           1,odo                   Total     It^fLAfter that the output of these motors could increase ex-tremely  rapidly; in fact it is possible that when Ford and theother large Detroit organisations get into production,  thesemotors will be manufactured at the rate of 1,000 per day.  Stopm
However it should be realised that as far as the UnitedStates participating in the spring campaign is concerned, itis unlikely that more than 5,000 fighting planes fitted withLiberty motors will be in France before July 1918.  Stop,   (3)  If we take as a suppositi.cn that the 5,000 WarService machines to be built by Americanswith Americanmaterial and money in Frar-.Ce,  and the. 500 Caproni machinesto be built in Northern Italy with American material andmoney, plus the combined output of the British and Frenchfactories will be sufficient to equalise the big effortwhich Germany i3 said to be making to gain preponderance inthe air, it will be necessary to rely  upon the UnitedStates for prepond-; ranee in the air in the late part of 1918.Stop.   (4)  The resources of United States have not yet beenscratched in the manufacture of. War Service machines,  andwith a proper incentive and if the country ia informedthat their contribution to the war should be in aircraft,they are capable of the most astonishing results.  Stop.They are only on the threshold now of what they can do in12 months time; in fact an organisation like Ford, withthe metal p.v.rts bein-* m-;.de at  an institution such as theNational Cash Rt lister they could turn out more biplanesin a month tha,n all the English factories are turning outin a year.   (5)  If we have the conviction that the result of thiswar is going te be considerably influenced by cutting theenemy1s communications by using large numbers of aircraft,it is necessary tc act accordingly and to ask what is. mostrequired by th:  Allied General Staff from the UnitedStates,             (A)  Aircraft ?             IB)  Infantry ?             (C)  Artillery ?and on this being decided there are only ttro factors leftto consider             (D)  Time             (E)  Tonnage.   Stop.       There i3 no doubt that  large number.! of Biplanescan be shipped across &quot;knocked doymV ready to assemblein American assembling plants  in Ireland or England. Stop.The United States Aircraft Production Board are perfectlycapable of organising such an  enterprise,  and not onlyconstructing the assembling factories in suitable locali-ties,  but supplying all the.equipment and the.trainedassemblers from this country.
