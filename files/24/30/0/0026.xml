AIR BOARD.

G.T.2426

Report to the Cabinet.

A.B. 153/39                                                    27th October 1917.



General Policy.  I. The Board have been before them a letter from the Field Marshal Commanding Home Defences

                on the subject of the failure of the aeroplanes at his disposal to attain the necessary

                height on the occasion of the recent Zeppelin raid. Although some doubt is still felt as

                to the capability of Zeppelins to attain with their load of bombs the extreme ? which are

                sometimes attributed to them, it appears to be established that the machines at present

                available for usp against the new type of Zeppelins have not a sufficiently high "ceiling".

                The difficulty consists in obtaining a machine which shall have the requisite climbing

                power and shall at the same time be capable of being landed sufficiently slowly at night

                to avoid undue risk of accident. Three steps are being taken with a view to remodying

                the present unsatisfactory situation. In the first place, as reported to the Cabinet on

                the 18th August, a specially designed night flying machine, known as the N.E.1, is now

                in course of trial and is likely to prove satisfactory. In the second place the B.E.12

                machine, the type at present used against Zeppelins, is being equipped with 200 HP.

                Hispano-Suiza engine which should materially improve is performance. In the third

                place some S.E.5. machines which are among our best single seater fighters in use at

                the at the Front are being allotted to Home Defence for the purpose of being tried for

                night work.



                  II. The Air Services have been hampered throughout the war by the inability to

                obtain ? large a supply of Rolls Roy? engines as ? desired. Messrs Rolls Royce have made

                it practically impossible for the Services to obtain a supply of their engines from any

                manufactures but themselves, and their own production, though it has considerably

                expanded, is nevertheless limited. The recent attempts of the firm to arrive at an

                arrangement with American manufacturers for the production of their engines in America

                have failed. It has, however, now been ? that the firm shall obtain from America

                sets of parts of their engine to the number of 1300, which parts will be shipped to

                this country and assembled at their works at Derby. This should permit of the firm

                attaining an output of 320 "Eagle" engines of 350 HP. per month by the end of 1913.



                   III. The Board have had under consideration a request by Messer. Reuters, Ltd.,

                to be allowed to            
establish an aerial express service between .London &amp; Paris.  Thoadvantages which this proposal offer from certain pointsof view&apos; are outweighed by the paramount considerationthat at the present time no part cf the aerial rosouroescf this country, either in pilots sr material, can b&amp; divertedfrom the:fighting fronts. .  The roquost has accordingly, forthe present, been refused.Supply. IV.
