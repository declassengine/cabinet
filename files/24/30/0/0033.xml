Memorandum &quot;by Mr. W,S. Churchill.                I observe that the War Cabinet  at  its meeting of October 24th discussed tho question of tho publication of the Second Report of the&apos; Dardanelles Commission and that  the  discussion was adjourned without any decision having been  reached,       T..e Act of Parliament constituting toe Gommission directs that the Report should be laid before Parliament, and  there  is  no  doubt that strong objection will be taken if it is withheld.  There  is no good reason for publishing the First Report and not publishing the Second,   Such a course would be unfair to individuals concerned. They have a right to claim that if a story of this kind is to  be told in public in time of war-,  it should be told in its intrebrityand not simply those parts made public which prejudicially affectsome individuals  whilst shieldin0 others,  The  fact that the firstReport covers the period  for  which  one political party was responsiblewhile the  Second  Report affects  the period where both parties in aCoalition Government were  responsible,  is  also material,  and itwould be- Invidious  to  pick and  choose  in  a matter of this kind.    It must  be remembered  that  the  Commander-in-Chief of  this expeditionSir Ian Hamilton, was  removed from  his command ana has been since  ex-eluded from  all employment,   It  would  be very  unjust  to this  officer,whose has  been the  victim  of  so  much ill-usage at the  hands of hissuperiors, that the  truth  should  not be known  and that he  should eontinu&quot;to  be the  scape-goat of this  extroadinary  delays and neglects on thepart of the whole Government which  led  to  the  failure  of  the  - enterprise
          Of course I recognise that reasons of State  in  thisformidable time may induce Parliament to postpose the publication, it if so it would be an obligation on the Government advocatinguch a course to make suro that the Commander-in-Chief whose militaryIharacter has been impugned should suffer no injustice  or loss from[hat course.           Finally,, it  is in any Case premature to decide againstlublication until the actual text of the Hauort is in the possessionf the Cabinet and can be  studiedofSfad).W,S.
