(This ftocwutftt is the Property ofHis Uritannic Majft*tv&apos;* 0^v*mColonel JonesSCRET.Intelligence Bureau,Department of  Information, y.      Memorandum on  the Dutch  Send and Gravel Questi on.                   (October  31st,  1917) Transit  of sand and,gravel from Germany to Belgium across  - Aether lands territory.   On October  10th  H. 2.*. Government  decided that the favour of using British  cables for  Dutch Commercial messages must be withdrawn.   The action  on the  part of the Netherlands Government which led to this  decision w^y   according to a  communique published by H.T-T. Legation at the Hague (Oct..24).be stated as follows   Jrom  information in the possession of the Allied Governments about 5,000,000 tons  of sand and gravel entered Belgium from Germany between  January and August 31st, 1917.    The upkeep of the roads in Belgium  require 1,320,000 tons  of  materials yearljr and the Belgian quarries can,  if necessary,  furnish four times that amount.   The                               sufficient roads in that  country are amoly/for heavy intercommunal traffic. The German contention is that 420,000 Tons monthly are necessary tomeet  the requirements of pacific road construction.    The Nether- lands Government sent two officers to Belgium to ascertain the truth.They  found that the quantities  imported did not exceed requirementsalthough expert opinion positively maintained that the figuresquoted were greatly in excess of the  amount legitimately required.The Entente Powers  then laid their case before the Hague Government -Months passed  without any reply.   Meanwhile the materials passingin transit through  Dutch territory increased to such an extent thatthe Netherlands Government realised that the traffic was excessive.They  then informed  the Governments concerned that the traffic wouldbe prohibited  from  August 15th  to  January 1st,    Sxcept in the case*f special works of a genuinely non-military character.   A further
Cornrriisslon of Netherlands  officers was sent to Belgium with the resultthat the  traffic  was  suspended for 19i7.    In September, however, itwas discovered  that provision  had been made whereby Germany couldimport during the Autumn of 1917 her requirements for the first monthsof 1918.    This convinced  the  Allied Governments that the materialswere being used for military purposes since road-making is notusually carried on in the  winter.   The British  centention  is based on Act.II of the Treaty of Oct.18th 1907,  which  forbids the transit over a neutral country&apos;s tesri-tory of troops, munitions^  previsions etc   The NetherlandsGovernment decline to recognise this contention, their point tfview being the  following:-   The British  Government  objects  to the  transport of sand andgravel over Dutch waterways from Germany  to Belgium on the groundthat the  quantity so  transported is in excess of peace requirementsand that  the material is,  in fact,  used by the Germans for militarypuiposes.   The Netherlands Government maintain that the RhineNavigation Act  of 1868 compels then to allow free navigation onthe waterways connecting the Rhine with Belgium.   As regards Art.II of the Neutrality  Treaty of 1907 the Netherlands Government,  inorder to  meet the prohibition  contained in that Article, obtaineda declaration from the German  Government  that the materials inquestion  were destined for peaceful purposes only.    They also ontwo separate occasions satisfied themselves that the Germans wereadhering  to their declaration.   During the course of 1917 the                                            -                          HiNetherlands Government informed the German Government that afterAugust 15th, 1917 it  could no  longer permit the transit of sand andgravel as the requirements of  certain specified works of peace wereamply provided  for by that date.    As,  however, during the winterthe traffic is  practically impossible,  the Netherlands Government
- 3 -feareed to permit the transit to  continue  between Sept.  15th andij.;0v.  15th of such quantities as  were  required  for the first three months of 1918 on the same footing as in  1916.    A request for an(extension on the part of the Germans  was  refused by the Netherlands Government.   No transit traffic will therefore  take place betweenI Nov.17 and March 15. &apos;18.   As regards the statistics of the traffic both sides maintain that the statistics of the other are inaccurate. Statement, by the Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs on the  sand  and gravel transit question.   On Oct^.  23 Mr.  Loudon in reply to various interpellations stated in the Chamber that no proposal had been received from the British Government to submit the dispute to Arbitration.   The Netherlands  Government would have no objection to submit to an international arbitration commission the question Whether  the transports complained of should be regarded as war-stores  in the sense of Art. II of the Treaty of 1907;  but after what had occurred it  was not for the Netherlands Government to make such a proposal.    For the last  two years the Netherlands Government had done all in  their power to ascertain what quantities of sand and gravel in transit were used for non-military purposes.   In OE- oosition to  the view of the German Government, the NetherlandsGovernment considered themselves bf?und by the Rhine Navigation Actof 1868 to permit only those quantities of material to pass as werenot destined for military purposes.    He was aware of the possi**bility that  the real use  of these materials does not correspond tothe results  of their investigations.    They had informed theBritish Government  that they would carefully examine any evidencethat the materials  were being used for military purposes.    Suohevidence had not reached  them.    In order th compel the  Netherlands
  Government to adoDt an attitude which the:/ consider contrary to their  treaty tbligations the British Government had denied to Netherlands  Trade the use of British cables.   He had orotested against this  action through the Netherlands Representative in London, so far  without success.   They would consider it contrary to their dignity                                   had  and to the principle to which they/firmly adhered, if, in consequence  of the pressure of one party, they should abandon their duty toI  the other party^ as laid down in existing Treaties.  The transit of metals from Belgium to Germany over Dutch territtry.    H.If.Government also object to this traffic on the same grounds.  The Netherlands Government contend that goods from Belgium are only  permitted to pass in transit if accompanied by a certificate  from a Dutch Consular officer showing that they had not been  requisitioned.   The orders issued in Belgium for the requisitioning  of metals induced the Dutch Government in the course of the year to  issue certificates in the ca3e of metals as the latter must as a  rule be considered as requisitioned.    The Netherlands Government  consider that an exception should be made for metals derived from  ores and scrap iron that had been exported from Germany to Belgium  for working.   The pure metal thus obtained cannot be considered as  requisitioned and the Government would act against its own rulings  if it prohibited the transit of such metal, from Belgium to Germany  along Dutch waterways.
