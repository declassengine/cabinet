p.From:-  CI.G.S, at Italian G.H.Q.To.-    Secretary of State, War Office,                             Handed in 3.25 a,m. November 1st.                             Received  3.25 p.m, November 1st.R,2,  31st Oct. Secret. General Poch and I have been most ofto-day with Cadorna.  The latter insists that recent events arenot due to military reasons, his measures for defence having beencomplete and efficient.  They are due, lie asserts, to treasonableconduct and refusal to oppose enemy on the part of his troops.This resulted in complete collapse of the whole defensive planand the capture by. the enemy of those troops who held their groundafter being left isolated by those which retired and surrendered.General Foch and I both took the line that v;o are ready to helpItaly as much as possible, if she will but help herself, butthat our help cannot avail if she will not or cannot do this..Whether Cadorna can reach tho Piave and then restore the situationmust mainly depend on the Italians themselves,  since French andBritish contingents cannot arrive soon enough to give effectiveassistance for at least a fortnight.  If commanders and staffs takehold of things with both hands there is no reason why situationshould not be retrieved, as enemy is not pressing vigorously andprobably cannot.  But I fear they will not thus take hold. TheGerman communiques are not published in Italy,  nor is there anyclear notion of the losses in men and guns, except that most gunsof all kinds of the 2nd Army are believed to have been lost.                                                         From
     From the above you will understand that there can beno question of an offensive in Italy unless and untilItalian Army is re-organized and that the best that can behoped at present is to save Italy by successful defence ofthe Piave, with an outside chance if this fails of doing soon the Mincio.   Cadorna takes a very pessimistic vievj ofmatters and referred to the six allied divisions as a dropin the bucket of his requirements.   But he has, as we toldhim, more than ample men if he will only get them organisedand commanded.   He admitted this, and said that If thingsdepended on himself all would be well, but he is helplessif the ground gives way under his feet.   We asked if ourGovernments could help him by putting pressure on his, but &apos;he said no.   General Foch and I discussed the possibilityof finding a better chief commander, and agreed there wasno better one to our knowledge.
