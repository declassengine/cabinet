                       POTATOES .          It is estimated that the potato crop in Scotland for 1917 Trill amount to 1,036,000 tons.  This is in excess of the average production for the previous five years by 137,800 tons.  Under normal conditions, the surplus might he absorbed through ordinary trade channels.  Taking the United ringdom as a n7holo/however, the 1917 crop exceeds the average yield of the past ten years by&apos; two million tons-. In addition, the crop grown on allotments, gardens, etc., is estimated to amount to 250,000 tons in excess of the yield so obtained in previous years.  The total excess crop In the United Kingdom therefore mounts to 2% million tons, and consequently the demand for Scottish potatoes  or con- sumption in England is extinguished.          Three pounds cf potatoes are roughly equivalent to one pound of bread, but  at present retail prices 3 lbs. of pctatoes cost 3d. whilst 1 lb. of bread costs 2?M,  Further  i potatoes have to be cooked whilst bread  is purchased ready for the table.  Tho comparative dearnoss of potatoes is producing a decrease in  the consumption of potatoes and an increase in the consumption of bread.  This involves a serious &quot;wa,ste of the potato crop, an increased demand forImported ^heat with further pressure on shipping facilities, and an extension of our indebtedness to &quot;heat  exporting countries .          The total crop of potatoes for the United Kingdom for 1917 is estimated at 0-g- million tons.  It  may be  assumed that 4-g- million tons vill &quot;be account 3d for in  the following ways:-
171     (1) Seed.     (2) Home consumption of: allotments and farmcrops by human beings and livestock.     (o) Portion of 1917 crop already consumed.This leaves a surplus of 4,000,000 tens, and in order tsecure the economic utilisation of this amount,immediate action is imper ative.          The main obstacle to increased consumption ofpotatoes is the price.  In normal times, they wereretailed at fd. per lb. and less.  To effect a reduc-tion in price &quot;would involve the payment direct to thefarmer by the State cf the subsidy which at present  isbeing paid by the consumer.  This direct payment ^ouldprobably require to be made in respect  of 4,000,000tons and the gross cost to the State would amount toapproximately  5,500,000.  The term &quot;Gross cost&quot; isused advisedly;  for if the reduction in the price,accompanied by a campaign for increased potato eon-sumption, resulted: in reducing wheatsonsumption by15$, which appears possible, there would be,  - assum-ing  45,000 ,000 as the cost of the wheat subsidy forthe purpose of the 9d. loaf - a saving  of  6,750,000                            ion the wheat subsidy,  leaving the not cost of  thopotato subsidy at  2,750,000.          The reduction of the price would encouragebakers to use greater quantities in baking bread.  Atpresent the price cf potatoes is too high tc renderthis practice profitable.  Potatoes cooked in  theirnatural condition,  or in bread,  represent  the  cheapestand best methods of utilisation as food.          I suggest that  the price of potatoes to theconsumer should be reduced to fd.  or less  per  lb.and that the loss involved by paying the  farmer  theprice of  6. per ton guaranteed by the  State be  bornefrom Imperial funds and not  by  the consumer.
          I understand that  proposals cf this nature havebeen befora the Food Controller,  and that there is no insuper-able administrative difficulty to prevent the adoption of theprinciple described.               (SB) P.0BSHT liUIJRO.Scottish Office,   27th October,  1917.
