(This DocwrMmt is the Property ofHis Britannic Nfaje*ty*s Govsrnmeriv470SEC RE T.OPERATIONS.From:- General Delme  Radcliffe,  Italy.War Office.Handed in at 1.50 a.m. 2nd Nov.1917.Received     11.0 a.m. 2nd Nov. 1917.-533 November 1st.       To-day situation seems slightly improved.3rd Army is all on right bank Tagliamento now exceptfor a force holding a bridge-head extending six kilometresup and down river  from Latisana and eastward to Stella river.This covers the passage of disorganised units (? of) 2nd Armywhich could not cross at Coroipo owing to destruction ofbridges.   3rd Army is recovering itself and has occupiedline of the Tagliamento.  With the exception of about sixty ithas brought away all its guns and has safely evacuated 13,000wounded *       To-day General Foch saw Duke of Aosta and receivedmore favourable general impression of disposition of 3rdArmy and of solidity of the troops.       2nd Army.   Attack is in progress against GeneralDi Giorgio!s detachment (20th and 33rd Divisions) holdingPinzano bridge-head.       Further south the enemyrs principal forces reportedto-be on the line of the Torre and his transport columns areon roads moving westward.   Enemyrs advanced guards areengaging Italian rear guards which appear to be holdingthem off and there is hope that more of the 2nd Army can besaved than seemed possible at one time.       Italian 1st Cavalry Division acting with rearguard has been badly cut up and its commander General Rubinhas been killed.Retirement
ill          Retirement  of Garnia  force  and 4th Army is  proceedingwithout  molestation by the  enemy so far but  it  is expected thatsome  of  the  guns  and  much heavy stores  must  be  lost.          It is now known German Officer who tried to driveinto  Gividale in  his  motor  car  before the place was evacuatedand who  with his  chauffeurs wore shot dead by the Carabinieriat the gate  while Aide-do-Camp  was  captured  was General VonWohraupt German 3rd Army Corps.          Weather clear and fine and  last night Gotha droppedseveral  bombs on  Treviso and other  places.    It is hoped rainwill  come before  tho  Tagliamonto becomes fordablo and so give timefor reforming of  troops and of  occupation of line Piave.          All the British guns  including 9.2&quot; howitzers have beennow brought  in and only one is  damaged.    Result is due todetermination of  officers and men of  the batteries and of ItalianOfficers attached who behaved admirably.  All  ammunition andmuch  storos  &amp;c.,  lost and consequently  until ammunitionreceived from homo batteries cannot go  into  action.          Collection  of stragglers  of tho 2nd Army proceedingand it is expected that large proportion of, the men can be putinto  the ranks again  as soon as they  have been  re-armed.   GeneralDallolio told me  he&apos; had enough  rifles for this  purpose andthat  only about half  the stragglers had lost their weapons.
