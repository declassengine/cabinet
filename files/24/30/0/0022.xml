EC R.E T.T. 2422.                         WAR CABINET^                     AIR POLICY COMMITTEE,.,                 PROGRESS OF AERIAL. 0PPI&apos;2T3IVE^      Memorandum &quot;by Lieut*.-General Sir David. Henderson.         Under present arrangements no inoependent bombing opera-    tions can be undertaken  before the Spring of 1918,  except by-    aeroplanes detached from the Naval and Military forces.  . Two    military squadrons and half a squadron of Naval machines are    now being sent  to the South-Eastern part of the Allied lines    in France for bombing purposes,   This force will act as  a    detachment from the British Expeditionary &quot;Korce.,  and it  is    anticipated that it will be possible to keep it up  to strength    without seriously interfering with the work of the  Navy  or    Army.  As the new programme of bombing squadrons materialises,    they will be able to take the places of the above squadrons    and a new independent force will  gradually be worked up  under    an Air officer  who will  be either the Commander or  second-in-    command of the  large bombing force spread over the  country    about Verdun, Fancy and  Belfort.   This new arrangement cf    command will probably be practicable in the early Spring. The    disposition cf  these squaarons will naturally depend to  some    extent  on the military situation,  but unless there  is some    important change in the  geographical disposition of the    opposing lines  on the Continent,  the above bases will probably    be the  most convenient.   It is also contemplated that some    long range machines may  be worked from behind, the British    lines.         It is essential that an officer and staff should at    once commence the necessary preliminary work for these    operations.  It does not follow that this officer shall  be    in command of the whole  force when it is established-  The    Senior  Officer  who is actually going to command may not  go    out until the operations are nearly ready to be commenced. -    The principal work which must be  started immediately is    the selection of places  for Aerodromes,  Depots and  Parks,    arranging for transport,  making necessary arrangements with    the French authorities,  and contracts for buildings..         In order that they  may not present a good target  to    the enemy,  the  aerodromes should  be  numerous and  the sheds    scattered,  unless it be  found possible to make the  sheds    bombproof.   Day bombing  squadrons  should have  jumping  off    places  30 to 40 miles behind the  lines with parks as con-    venient.,  and the depots  70 to 80  miles behind  them.  Night    bombing squadrons on long distance  raids  can  start  from    close behind the lines.r,nrTiirgT^^ THE PROPERTY OP HIS  BRIT AMI C MAJESTY&apos;S^OVEaHMENT .)
      It is desirable that until large bombing squadronsare ready to commence operations, the important Bosch factoryand submarine engine factories at Stuttgart, Hages, and Cologneshould not be inefficiently bombed,  as such action serves onlyas a warning to the enemy.  The objectives during the winterwould probably be confined to the iron works and other objec-tives which are situated in areas extending from 40 to 70 milesfrom Fancy,  munition factories in the Karlsruhe area, 100 milesfrom Nancy;  munition factories and chemical works in theStrasburg area,  70 miles from Nancy;  and chemical works in theMannheim area.  120 miles from Nancy.  This latter would be aboutthe furthest point that it would be  advisable to attempt inwinter time, and it might be preferable to leave it till thelarger operations in the Spring.  It  is recognised, however,  thatthis policy may have to bo departed from,  for political reasons.      It would seem unwise,  at the present moment,  to makeprovision for the employment of any  independent bombing forcein distant theatres cf operation.  In any case it is improbablethat the shipping situation would permit of the establishmentof any large force cither in Salonika or Palestine, and theorganisation of a force of moderate  size will not present seriousdifficulty.      The most important consideration to bear in mind is thepossibility cf any political change  in the situation.  There arecertain neutral countries whose entry into the war, either for oragainst us,  would open up new possibilities.  In organising theindependent force these possibilities will be borne in mind.The problem at present before us is  chiefly connected with thepreparation of the site3 in Frarce and the consequent transport,and the training cf pilots and buildin  of machines in thiscountry.      With re ard to the programme of construction,  and itsprogress,  the policy hitherto approved is to increase con-tinuously the day bombing squadrons  of the Expeditionary Force.If the estimates of the Supply Department are fulfilled,  thesquadrons suitable for bombing should number                   6 in November                   7 in December                   9 in January 1918                  11 in February                  14 in March.This allotment should enable the Expeditionary Force to maintain,during the winter,  a strong detachment at  Ochey,  or elsewhere inthat neighbourhood,  without seriously interfering with the workfrom the British. Front.      In April it is anticipated that the  first squadron  onthe &quot;additional  programme&quot; will be ready,  this being a squadronof large hi  tht-flying machines.  In May there will  be 3 squadronsof night bombers.   From this date, deliveries should be at therate of about lo squaarons of day bombers  and 4 oqua^drens  cfnight bombers per month beyond the present programme  of theExpeditionary Force.      There  is reason to hope that, in so  far as  deliveriesof material  are  concerned,  this programme  may be/nearly ful-filled,  although it must be  remembered that supply  is exposedto many dangers  in the way of labour  troubles and shortage ofraw material.. Priority of aeronautical supply has  beenestablished, and owing to thii advantage it is possible  toaccelerate deliveries.  The  corresponding  acceleration in  the-supply of pilots and trained personnel
cannot, however, be guaranteed unless similar priority  is  grantedat once.   The  concessions required are,  in order  of  importance  :-    ,-(a)   Immediate allotment of personnel to the  R.IT.A.S.  and          R.P.C. to make good the present deficit,     (b)   Allotments of additional personnel to accelerate  the          training programme in order to ensure the efficient          manning of the increased number of machines.      (c)  Supply of women to replace  ^en.  Tnore has  been &apos;          much delay over this.     (d)    L;i&quot;. A. S. and P..P. C. have hitherto been very well          treated in the matter of supply of cadets for training          as pilots.   The requirements in this respect, however,          will increase .     (e)   Priorities for the aerodrome programme .  The principal          items are labour and permission to use a certain  amount          of timber .  with reference to the question  of hutting          in winter, the urgency of the provision  of  aerodromes          was so great that D.O.L.A. consented to R.P.G, personnel          being accommodated in tents throughout the  winter ,          although it is believed that all other personnel  of          the Army or havy will be housed .   The lack of hutting          affects efficiency in two ways; the men are employed         principally at their trades , and do not have the          advantages of continuous open air exercise  like other          troops; and also being mostly 3 and C men,.the         percentage of: sickness is certain to be high.  Timber          is now being&apos; used to make huts by other departments,         but General Eabati is properly adhering to his orders         and  is using none .   The  amount required is not          large, and some relief might be given.              The question of labour&apos; for aerodromes&apos;  is being         dealt with.       .  The  Training Division P.P.C.  is making arrangements         to provide pilots  and personnel for  62 squadrons  , outside         Army  requirements , by July 1918 , and if the  men are         provided in due time for  training the  organisation         should be  capable  of carrying out this forecast.    The         extent to  which the P.P.A.S.  can assist is not yet         clear, as  the requirements  for purely   aval  purposes         are  likely to increase , but  taking  into account, the         peculiar, difficulty of  supplying the machines chiefly         required in the  Navy,  it  is  probable  that the  P. *&quot;(./:. .         could man  some  10  squadrons .(Sd.)
