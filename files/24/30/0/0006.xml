:1^Btofiument is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.JPrinted for the War Cabinet.  October 1017.SECRET.THE FUTURE OF  PALESTINE.    I AM not concerned to discuss the question in dispute between the Zionist andanti-Zionist  Jews, viz., whether  it  is  possible to reconcile  the  reconstitution of anational home For the Jewish race  in Palestine  with  the  contented assimilation ofmany millions of Jews in other  countries where they have acquired nationality  andmade a home.    1 am only interested in the more immediately practical questions :     (a.) What is the meaning of the phrase &quot;a National Home  for the Jewish Race           in  Palestine,&quot; and what is the nature of the obligation that we shall assume           if we accept  this as a principle of British policy ?    (6.) If  such . a  policy  be  pursued  what  are the  chances of  its  successful           realisation ?    For important as may be the  political  reasons (and  they seem  to me almostexclusively political) for adopting such a line of action, we ought at least  to  considerwhether we are encouraging.a practicable ideal, or preparing the way for disappointmentaud failure.    If I seek guidance from the  latest collection of circulated  papers  (The. ZionistMovement, G.-164)  I find  a  fundamental disagreement among the authorities quotedthere as to the scope  and nature of their aim.  A &quot; National Home  for the Jewish raceor people &quot;  would seem, if the words are to  bear their ordinary  meaning, to imply aplace where the Jews can be reassembled as  a nation,  and where they will enjoy theprivileges  of an  independent -national existence.   Such  is  clearly the conception ofthose who, like Sir A.  Mond, speak of the creation in Palestine of &quot; an autonomous JewishState,&quot; words which appear to contemplate a State, i.e.,  a political entity, composedof Jews, governed by Jews, and administered mainly in the interests of  Jews.   Such aState might  naturally  be expected  to have a capital,  a form of government,  andinstitutions of its own.   It would possess the soil or the  greater part of the soil of thecountry.   It  would take its place among the smaller nations of the earth.    The same conception appears to underlie several other of the phrases  employed inthese-.papers,  e.g., when  we are told that Palestincis to become &quot; a  home for the Jewishnation,&quot; &quot; a national  home for the  Jewish  race,&quot; &quot; a Jewish Palestine,&quot; and when weread of &quot; the resettlement of Palestine as a national centre,&quot; and  &quot;the restoration ofPalestine to the Jewish  people.&quot;  All these  phrases are variants of  the same idea, viz.,the recreation of Palestine as it was before the days of the dispersion.    Oh the other hand, Lord Rothschild, when  he speaks  of Palestine as &quot;a homewhere the Jeus couid speak their own language, have their  own education, their owncivilisation, and  religious institutions under  the protection of  Allied Governments,&quot;seems to postulate a much less definite form of political.existence, one, indeed,  which isquite  compatible with the existence of an  alien (so  long as  it is  not  aGovernment.    At the other extreme  the late  Lord Cromer,  who  favoured the Zionist  cause,explains that  the resuscitated Palestine is only to be &quot;the spiritual  centre of the Jews&quot;and a reservoir of Jewish culture aspirations whicT are wholly different  from thosewhich I have  just recorded, and which appear to be incompatible with the evolution of acomparatively email and for the  most part agricultural or pastoral community.    I call attention  to  these contradictions  because they suggest some hesitancy inespousing a cause whose advocates have such very different ideas of what they  mean.   . But I must  proceed further to point out that,  whichever interpretation  we adopt,Palestine would appear to be incapacitated by physical and other conditions  from everhecoming in any real sense the national home  of the Jewish people.    That  people numbers, we are told, about  12,000,000, scattered in all parts of  theworld.  Of this total 9^ millions are  in  Europe (including .6 millions  in Russia) and
 2 millions in North America.   The number in the  United  Kingdom is 245,000 ; the number already in Palestine was, before the war, 125,000.     Now what is the capacity as regards population of Palestine within any reasonable period  of time?  Under the  Turks there is  no such place or country as Palestine, because it is divided up between the sanjak of Jerusalem  and the vilayets of Syria and Beirut.   But let us  assume that in speaking of Palestine  in the present context we  , mean  the old Scriptural Palestine, extending from Dan  to Beersheba, i.e., from Bani;is to Bir Saba.  This is a country of less than 10,000 square miles, including 4,000 to the east of the Jordan, i.e., it is a country which, excluding desert lands, is not much bigger than Wales. . Now Wales, in spite of having one city of nearly 200,000 people, and two others of 200,000 between them, only supports a population of 2,000.000 persons.     Palestine, on the other hand, before the war contained a population the highest estimate  of  which  was between 600,000 and 700,000 persons, of which less than  one- quarter were Jews  and  the  remainder  (except for  small  Christian  communities or settlements) Moslems.  The Jews were to a large extent congregated in the few towns, e.g., in Jerusalem, where, out  of a  total population of 80,000, 55,000 were Jews for the  most part living on  alms or charity, or old men come to end  their days in the Holy City.   The  Jewish colonies, about  which so much has been  said, contained a population of only 11,000.  The remainder of the Jews were in the other towns and parts of the  country.     Since the war the Turks  have reduced the country to a  condition,of abject debase- ment.   The  Jewish colonies  have either been dislocated or broken up, the various missionary establishments, except the German and  Spanish, have disappeared,  the local inhabitants have been  conscripted and. to a large extent destroyed on  the front, the urban   populations  have  been  reduced  to   beggary,  and  colonies  of Turkomans, Circassians, Kurds, and other savage races have been planted about to hold the country in subjection.     Before  the war it was calculated by competent  authorities who bad lived for years in the country that for many years it could not support an increased population.  After the devastation wrought by the war it will be many decades  before we can contemplate a population that will even remotely approximate to that of Wales.  This is a position due not merely to the ravages  of war, but to the present physical  conditions of the country, brought about by  centuries of neglect and misrule.  Before any considerable revival can  be  expected  there must be a colossal expenditure  on  afforestation,  on irrigation, on the rebuilding of the broken-down terraces  which formerly supported the cultivation.   The Scriptural phase,  a  land &quot; flowing, with  milk and honey,&quot; which suggests  an. abounding fertility,  must be read in relation to the de-ert  features of Sinai, to  which it stood  in glowing c  mtrast, and  loses somewhat of its picturesque charm when we realise that the milk was that of the flocks of goats that roamed, and still ream, the hills, while the honey was  the juice of the  small grape that was used as a substitute for sugar and still makes a palatable wine.     Further, let it be borne in mind,  when  we speak of this devastated country as a national home for a great people, that in the steamy Jordan valley  no  Europeans can live or  rear  children, that only  the  higher parts of the  country are suited for settlers who come from more  northerly climes,  that malaria,  fever, ophthalmia, and other ailments abound, not to be eradicated save by great outlay and after a long time.     Palestine is, in fact, a poor land, containing no mineral wealth, no coal, no  iron ore, no copper, gold, or silver.   It depends entirely on livestock (i.c, mainly, goats which crop the bare hills) and agriculture.  In parts, but in parts only, where  there is sufficient water and a good climate, excellent crops  of wheat and barley are  produced.  Olive oil, sesame, and  oranges are the chief exports.     Such is the country a country calling for prolonged  and patient toil from  a people inured  to agriculture and even si only admitting  after generations  of a relatively small population-that we are invited (if we can get hold of it, which we have not vet done)  to convert into the national home  of a people, numbering many millions,  brought from other and different climates, and to a large extent trained in other industries and professions.     There arises the further question, what is to become of the people of  this country, assuming the Turk to be expelled, and the inhabitants not  to have been exterminated by-the war ?  There are over half a million  of these, Syrian Arabs a mixed community with Arab, Hebrew,  Canaanite, Greek, Egyptian, and possibly Crusaders&apos; blood.   They and their forefathers have occupied the country for the best part of 1,500 years.  They own the soil,, which belongs either to individual landowners  or to village communities.  They profess the Mohammedan faith.  They will not be content either to be expropriated for
Jewish immigrants,  or to act merely as hewers of wood and drawers of water to thelatter.    Further, there  are other settlers who will have  to  be  reckoned with.   There are100,000 Christians,  who will not  wish to be disturbed;  east of the  Jordan are largecolonies of Circassian Mahommedans,  firmly established;  there are also  settlementsof Druses and Moslems from Algeria, Bulgaria, and Egypt.    No doubt a prodigal expenditure of wealth will secure the expropriation of some ofthese.  But when we reflect that the  existing Jewish colonies, in  the  most favouredspots, after a prodigious outlav, extending over many years, have only in a few cases asvet become self-supporting, it is  clear that a long  vista of anxiety, vicissitude, andexpense lies before those who desire to rebuild the national home.    I spoke earlier  of the dreams of those who foresee a Jewish State, with possiblya Jewish  capital at Jerusalem.  Such  a dream is rendered wholly incapable  ofrealisation by the conditions of Jerusalem itself.   It is a city in which too many peoplesand too many religions, have a passionate  and  permanent interest to render an)&apos; suchsolution even dimly possible.   The Protestant communities are vitally interested  in thechurches and in the country as  the  scene of the most sacred events in history.   TneBom an  Catholics collect annually large sums and maintain extensive establishments atJerusalem and Bethlehem.  The  Greek  Orthodox Church regards  the Holy  Placeswith an  almost  frenzied reverence.   Great pilgrimages  come  annually from the Slavcountries and Russia. I recall a flourishing Russian monastery on Mount Tabor.   TheHellenic clergy have large properties in the country.    Finally, next, to Mecca and Medina, Jerusalem  is  the  most  sacred city of theMohammedan faith.  The Mosque of Omar, on the site of the  Temple of Solomon, isone of the  most hallowed of the shrines of Islam.   It contains  the  great rock  orstone,  from  which  Mohammed   ascended on the  back of  his  miraculous steed  toHeaven, and which  is regarded  with so much awe in the Moslem  wot Id  that  when,a few years ago, an  Englishman was alleged to have been digging under it,  the uproarspread throughout the Moslem world.   It is impossible to contemplate  any  future  inwhich the Mohammedans should be excluded from Jerusalem.  Hebron is a site scarcelyless sacred to Islam.  It is no doubt from a full consciousness of  these facts that thewisest of the Zionists forgo any claim to the recovery of Jerusalem as the centre  andcapital of a revived  Jewish State,  and hope only that it may,remain as a sort of enclavein international, if not in British, hands.    But is  it not obvious that a country which  cannot within any proximate periodcontain anything but a small population, which has already an indigenous population ofits own of a different race and  creed, which can possess no urban centre or capital, andwhich is suited only to certain forms of agricultural and pastoral  development, cannot,save by a  very elastic use of  the term, be designated as the national  home of theJewish people ?  It  mav become  the home of a considerably  larger number of Jewishsettlers than now, mainly  brought from the eastern parts of.Europe (though  the chanceof their coming in  large numbers or being sent for political reasons from Austria  andGermany is by  no  means  to be ignored) ; this colonisation  ma)&apos; be supported by theexpenditure of large sums of  money;  the productiveness and  health of the countrymay be  slowly improved  by the  application of enterprise and science;  a Jewish com-munity, freed from  the  misrule of the Turks and enjoying equal rights  with othersections of  the population, may become prosperous and even powerful.   But again Iask,  is this what we contemplate when we say  in  our proposed formula that  &quot; His.Majesty&apos;s  Government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of  a nationalhome lor  the Jewish race &quot; ?  If we contemplate no  more, is it wise to  use languagewinch suggests so much m^re f  *    In reality is  not the maximum policy that we  can possibly hope  to  realise  onewhich, if the Turks  are defeated and turned out of Palestine,  will     (a.) Set up some form of European administration  (it cannot be  Jewish adminis-           traiion)  in that country.    (b.) Devise a machinery for safeguarding and securing order both in the Christian           and in the Jewish Holy Places.    (c.) Similarly guarantee the integrity of the Mosque of Omar and vest it in  some           Moslem  body.    (dj Secure  to  the  Jews  (but not  to the Jews  alone) equal civil and religious           /ights with the other elements in the population.    (e.) A- range as .far  as possible for land purchase and  settlement  of  returning       .. / Jews,          .;.  ..  ........  ,                  .      -    -
    If this is Zionism there is no.reason  why we should  not all be  Zionists, and  Iwould gladly &quot;give my adhesion to such  a policy, all the  more that it appears to berecommended by considerations of the highest expediency, and to be urgently demandedas a check or counterblast to the scarcely concealed and  sinister political designs of theGermans.   But in  my judgment it is a  policy very wjdely removed from  the  romanticand idealistic aspirations of many of the Zionist leaders whose literature I  have studied,and, whatever it does, it will not in my judgment provide either a  national, a  material,or even a spiritual  home for any  more than  a very small section of the Jewish people.                                                                       C. OF K.    October 26, 1917.
