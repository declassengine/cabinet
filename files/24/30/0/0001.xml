r 4 -        An Executive of,(I believe) 24 persons was nominatedto operate under the direction of a &quot;President&quot;.   I have notthe names at present.        In the course of the discussion of the &quot;Constitution&quot;proposals requiring adherents of Sinn Fein to drill and arm andto establish immediately a Provisional Government ^ere made anddiscussed, but not specifically adopted.   There appear to havebeen divisions of opinion on the question of the Presidency ofSinn Fein, but in the end Count Plunkett and Mr. ArthurGriffith withdrew and Mr, de Valera was elected unanimously.        One of the papers reports that *.r.       &quot;* &quot;The Countess Marxievicz created the sensation of the        &quot;day when she came forward to protest against the        &quot;election of ?-Ir, John Mac^eiH on the executive.   There        &quot;were angry protests as she proceeded to set forth her        &quot;reasons, stating she was eating under a sense of        &quot;obligation to the men who wore dead., as v-*ell as those        &quot;in the movement who were living.   There was a wave of        &quot;cheering when Mr. A. Griffith declared that John        &quot;MaclTeill did his duty to Ireland when it came to him,        &quot;without the mean fear of death.   &quot;I will stand and        &quot;fall, with John MaclTeill&quot;, he declared&quot;.        There are various indications of disagreements betweenthe de Valera section and the Griffith and MacUeill section ofthe Thctremist s,  many people who profess to know name-thesecrets of the  Sinn Fein movement expect that they willrapidly develop.(Intd.)
