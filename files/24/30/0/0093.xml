Oolonel JonesMINISTRY  OF  SHIPPINGr    J&apos;  &apos;                   /49   1 pMIf ALLIED FOOD PROBLEM IN RELATIONALLJ^   TO GENERAL TONNAGE POSITION.          The French Government is pressing strongly upon  the British Government a request that fa) the minimum food requirements of France, Italy and Great Britain should be  a common responsibility upon the tonnage of the three countries, and (b) that for the present the food imports required for the three countries should have priority over all other imports.          The Cabinet while not at present committing themselves to this policy in full have issued an immediate order to divert grain to France and Italy during the next two months.          These proposed diversions are based upon the Food Controllers views as to the extent to which he is prepared to allow British stocks to run down.   If the diversions would in fact  be wholly at the expense of British stocks of food,  the Food  Controller alone of course ;and not the  Ministry of Shipping would be concerned.          The Food Controllers estimates, however,  must  be based upon  some assumption as to the imports of wheat to this country which be would be obtaining apart  from the diversions,  and the Ministry of  Shipping is vitally interested in any such assumptions, as no undertaking has at  present  been given to provide a specified quantity of tonnage for  food imports into  this  country.Nor can any  undertaking, be  given  without  consideration of all of the other competing British demands for tonnage.          That is to say that the  Ministry of Shipping cannot tell  the Food Controller what tonnage  can  be  allotted  to  him, flor therefore can France and Italy know what  their positionwill  be and  make  their arrangements  accordingly,  until  we                                                         have
have arrived at a decision as to the way in which Britishrequirements shall be adjusted to the reduced carrying powerof British ships.          The Ministry of Shipping have submitted a statementshewing (a^ that even if no extra assistance had to be given tothe Allies, British imports next year would be less than theimports this year by some 6,000,000 tons,  (b)  that if thereforethe extra demand of the    ies for cereals amounting to over2;000,000 tons has to fall upon Brilish tonnage the decrease inBritish imports must exceed 8,000,000 tons, and (c) that if itproves that the tonnage under the control of the French andItalian Governments themselves is seriously diminished ascompared with the last year (as indeed must be the case throughlosses, &amp;c.) and if this further deficit has again to fall onBritish tonnage, the decrease in British imports must begreater than even this higher figure of over 8., 000,000 tons.          In these circumstances the Ministry of Shipping isasking that a small Committee with a member of the Y/ar Cabinetas Chairman (who would be able to devote the greater part ofhis time to the work) and including a representative of the FoodController, Ministry of Munitions, the VJheat Commission and theBoard of Trade with representatives of the Ministry of Shipping,should be at once appointed with definite orders to cut down therequirements of British imports so as to meet the deficitindicated above as necessary, or at least as a first measure suchpart of the deficit as is inevitable even if no further aid hadto be given to the Allies, viz-. 6,000,000 tons.          The dislocation of.vital British services resultingfrom such a decrease must in any event be serious.  If, however,each of the main Departments concerned knows approximately theextent of the reduction it must face and at once takesexecutive action on the basis of that reduction, this dislocation                                                         will
  nil be reduced to a minimum.  If for instance it is decided  that  frozen meat must be cut down, the Pood Controller can take steps  to kill more cattle or to introduce meatless days or to substitute  tinned meat, &amp;c.  If it is decided that- sugar must be cut down,  the ration can be adjusted beforehand accordingly.  If it is  known that the supply of cotton must be cut down, steps can be taken  to diminish the use of cotton gradually and to provide for the  displacement of labour.  If it is decided that imports cf ore must  be cut down the Ministry of Itoitions can take steps to reduce the  exports of the products of ore and to increase the production of  home ore.           A decision given by the Cabinet which would impose upon  the Ministry of Shipping the immediate necessity of finding  additional ships from somewhere,  whether  for wheat or any other  specified  article,  without any previously arranged programme  indicating the services from which these  ships should be obtained,  would have disastrous results.           A programme must be made.   It would, it is suggested,  more properly be made by a small  Committee sitting as proposed  above de die in diem, and under direct instructions of the Cabinet.  In the absence of such a body the responsibility must devolve upon  the Ministry of Shipping itself.   But if  that is to happen,  it is  necessary  for the Cabinet to realise the  position exactly.  Nor  can the  other Departments be expected to  accept a programme  so  imposed  upon them without frequent and separate appeals  to the  Cabinet  for over-riding decisions.  If, however,  the Ministry  made no  such programme,  or if the programme  were  cancelled in  detail by  separate  decisions of the  Cabinet,  the  results wouldfcbe  disastrous.  The Ilinistry would then be faced with the immediate  necessity  of finding ships from any  source at short  notice.   They would have to take  them haphazard for instance from ore,  from  nitrates,  from sugar,  or from cotton.  The result would  be that  the  consumption of cotton having  been retained at its present  x                                                       level
 level until  the  last  moment  would suddenly be cut down to such an extent  that confusion  would be inevitable and serious unemployment  result.   Blast  furnaces  would suddenly be put out of action without  the Ministry of Munitions having been able either to  take measures to meet the deficit of imports by increasing home  production or -rearrange &quot;their general programme on tile  basis  of  smaller supplies  of ore.   The sugar ration having been  started  on  the basis of the  old programme,  an  absolute shortage of sugar in  certain districts or  everywhere  for a period would  suddenly occur; and so with every other main  commodity at whose  expense the Ministry of Shipping would  be  forced  to  obtain vessels from hand to mouth to&apos;meet the need of the  moment.          The, necessity for. action is immediate, because with every dayfs delay further relatively unessential imports ara brought in and therefore more essential imports excluded; and because the programme of reduction which may  finally be settled has to work Within a.shorter period and therefore must have  a more serious incidence during that period.          It is therefore  of the utmost importance  that the Committee should  be appointed at once and should sit de die  in diem until its work is done.   It is of the utmost importance that the Committee should commence -as the Babington Smith Committee did early in this year with the assistance of a definite. Cabinet order as to the extent to  which they are to effect reductions. Such an order which was an effective help to the earlier Committee is much more necessary now. because the commod ities which nowhave to be restricted are  so much more essential, and therefore representatives of the different Departments cannot be expected to agree to the serious measures which the position requires unless they are working under definite orders from the Cabinet as to the total reduction  to  be arranged for.                                  End November 1917..   .
    MINISTRY  Off  SHIPPINGNOTE AS TO TONNAGE POSITION FOR            1918.       It is necessary to present to the Government and to thevarious Departments chiefly concerned as close an estimate asis practicable of the tonnage position for 1918, because it isclear that merchant shipping will be the main limiting factorin the operations and preparations of the Allies in everydirection, and because re-adjustment of programmes and policymust be undertaken at once, if unnecessary dislocation anddisaster are to be prevented.       The general position may be stated briefly by sayingthat we shall during 1917 have lost about 600 ocean goingvessels more than we have acquired.   Allowing for increasedbuilding and a consequent decrease in the rate of net loss, wemay take the mean number of large British vessels working during1917.    As these vessels would have been sufficient to import7 or 8 million tons, the imports to this country must be reduced byby that amount if other factors remain the same.        Such a statement of the position is necessarily veryrough and general.    A more precise statement would require anexhaustive examination of such factors as the American position,the possibility of changes in military and naval operations, thefood requirements of all the Allies as affected by reducedharvests, the availability of neutral tonnage as well asforecasts both of future losses and of building.    It must, ofcourse, be remembered that shipping estimates are necessarilymore subject to variation than those relating to the work ofother Departments because they reflect the accumulateduncertainties of all other Departments.     There is  indeed                                              - scarcely -
 scarcely any major event, whether political, military, naval or natural in any country in the world which does not re-act upon our tonnage position.    The Russian Revolution, the entry of America into the war, any proposal to redistribute military or naval forces, or the failure of harvests in Allied or Neutral countries, each and all seriously and immediately affect any forecast.             In the present calculations no allowance has been made for assistance to or from America and it has been assumed that the demands of our military and naval operations will continue as at present, that losses will be in accordance with this yearfs experience and building in accordance with the present probabilities.    This gives the reduction indicated above.   It is necessary, however, to redkon an addition  /ith the fact that France and Italy will together probably have to import over two million tons more cereals during this cereal year than last, and we must regard the whole or the great bulk of these extra requirements as likely to fall upon British Tonnage.   It is true that France and Italy may to some small extent be able to improve the services rendered by thoir own ships.   As against this, however, must be set the fact that the great bulk of these extra imports will have to be met in the first 8 months of next year, as the importations this year have been falling into arrears and cannot be brought upj  and that as the Allies have been themselves sustaining serious losses, they will have less vessels of their own at their disposal.             It is necessary,  therefore,  to face a prospective deficit at the least of over 8,000,000 tons of British imports ascompared with the year 1917.  A closer estimate  is being  made  inconjunction with a further examination of a number of the  un-.certain factors mentioned  above,  and will be  furnished as  soon                                                         as
 as possible.   In the  meantime,  however,  the statement of the position  in this memorandum is  perhaps sufficient as a basis of consideration of the measures to be  taken,  and the position itself so serious that it  is essential  that  this  consideration should commence  at ohce.           These  figures have perhaps a  truer significance if considered in relation to  the following analysis  of 1916 and 1917 imports (oil  fuel for Admiralty and tank vessels conveying it  excluded  from the calculations).

In
    In order to  balance  requirements and available carrying power,  it  is necessary  to  select  reductions  amounting to a total of over 8,000,000  tons at the least  from the above items5 In some cases a reduction  in one  article would not give  the equivalent  in other imports.   As an example,  if  all  paper and paper making materials were stopped, we should not save  tonnage sufficient  to bring other  imports to the amount of the 590,000 tons  of paper and paper making materials which are being imported this  year, as the great bulk of it  comes in  vessels that would otherwise come  from Scandinavia in  ballast.    The  same is true to a  somewhat lesser extent in the case of timber.   With a few exceptions of this kind, however, it may be  said roughly that if reductions totalling something over 8*000,000 tons could be contemplated and consequent departmental programmes arranged - accordingly,  the problem would be solved.   As indications of the lines upon which consideration  of the problem might perhaps most profitable proceed, the following suggestions may be made (a)  The policy of bringing liners employed on more distant routes into the  Atlantic might  be  pushed further with the aim of increasing their  importing capacityj by, say, 1,000,000 tons; and reducing the deficit  to  that  extent.   This  would,however, mean the  sacrifice of  many  articles  hitherto  regardedas indispensable by different Departments,  or finding nearersources  of  supply  than hitherto.                &apos; ,   In particular it would entail  the re-organisation of thewhole of the meat  supply.(b)  A large reduction in our exports of the  products  of  ironore,(c)  large  reductions  in cotton, wool,  flax and jute.(d)  A large reduction in the import of pit-props  which can onlybe  got by a corresponding increase in home production.                                                      (e)
  (e)  4 reduction in the ration of sugar and supplies of other  foodstuffs,  (f)  A general reduction in the munitions programme.      When the utmost possible has been done in these directions,  it might be well to make a considerable appeal on behalf of the  giropean Allies to Amerioa for assistance,  perhaps the appeal to America might precede a decision to take the most extreme measures under (e) and (f)  which would require to be taken if that appeal fails.    In practice,  however,  this appeal would probably only be effective at the cost  of reducing the number of American troops available in France  to the  full extent of the  number of troops which could be  supplied with  the  vessels we should be asking the Americans to give us.    This  is  only to  say, what is already evident,  that the Americans will  have more  troops ready than they  can  transport and supply with  their own ships,  so  that  any loss  of vessels  must mean a corresponding reduction in  the military  assistance  they can give to  the Allies.      To the  extent to  which all the  above measures  are.inadequate to meet the  deficit, it will be necessary to take  the problem into  the  higher  sphere of major political, military  and naval considerations,  and the Government would have  to  donsider for instance  whether it is possible to assist Bussia next year and  to maintain  in our  several foreign expeditions, but it  is  evident that  the problem ought only to be taken,  into this sphere when every possible means of dealing with it  in&apos; other ways has been exhausted.   For the purpose  of finding these other ways, a Conference of representatives  of the Departments chiefly concerned is being at once convened, and while the ministry of Shipping will be prepared with certain further suggestions beyond those indicated in this memorandum,  it is hoped that the representatives of the different Departments will all themselves come  with furtherproposals designed  to secure a substantial contribution  towardsmeeting the deficit.
