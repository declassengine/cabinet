I have considered carefully the Memorandum (u.T. 2372) byMr- Hayes Fisher, supported by a Itote from Mr. -Stephen Walsh,pressing for the iromediate introduction of the L.G.B.ts Maternityand Child Welfare Bill.     2. On August 2nd I presented a Memo, to the Cabinet in whichI made various suggestions that I thought might-be found a moredesirable way of achieving the end in view and would reduce con-troversy.   It was notimy intention then, and it is not my purposenow, to place any obstacle in the way of the desired legislation;on the contrary, I am heartily desirous of seeing new powersobtained for the development of this work at the earliest possiblemoment;  and I earnestly hope that the Cabinet will speedily decidein this sense.     3. The Cabinet may desire, however, to have before them thechief points on which representations have been made to me as tothe lines on which the new powers to be given to looal authorities &quot;should preferably be exercised.     4. In the first place, it is suggested that the new powersshould not be given to all the Rural and small Urban and BoroughCouncils.   It should not be difficult to arrive at an adequatecompromise, quickly, as to where to draw the line, e.g., the corn-promise of 1902, the Boroughs having over10,000 population, andthe Urban Districts over 20,000.   To confer the new powers onBorne 1,700 different authorities (including the Rural Districts)throughout the counties of England and Wales is strongly depre-catedj  especially since the Rural Councils are almost the sameas Poor Law Guardians, and on this account most unsuitable for thepurposes in view.     6. The Health Insurance Committees and Sooietieo have certainimportant powers and duties in respeot of adaternity, and they haverepresented to me that in their view it is of great importance soto arrange the exercise of the new maternity powers by localauthorities that they Bhall not supersede, or impede the develop-ment of, this work of theirs, particularly as regards the provisionof domiciliary medical attendance;  but that the two sets offunotions should be satisfactorily co-ordinated in new looalschemes.   It happens that the Local Government Board can, I think,without difficulty meet this particular point;  for ao they havealready intimated they &quot;have no intentions of using the powers ofthe proposed Bill for the purpose of establishing domiciliarymedical attendance&quot; under the Local Authorities (except specialvisits  in abnormal cases).   (Cab. alemo. G.T. 1662 of Aug. 9th).I  suggest, therefore, that the wording of the Bill, which as atpresent drafted would oomprls*3   these services, should be amendedso as to make explicit these intentions;  I am sure this would goa  long  way towards removing the objections felt by the Insuranceorganisations to it in its present dtepe on this point.                         1. 77 0
     6. The Health Insurance organisations have also stronglyrepresented to me their view that it would be unfortunate thithe central supervision, direction and grant-aiding of the nepowers to be given to the Local Authorities should be in thehands of the L.G.3. alone, since the new Bohemes  of the LocalAuthorities will need to be carefully co-ordinated in this xfwith the work of the Local Health Insurance organisations.anxious, however, not to pre as this latter point  myself, as 1recognise the difficulties of tho situation.   It must beremembered, however, that the Health insurance organisationsdireotly with some 72f* of the married women of child-bearingin England and Wales, and bring assistance to the women in t;Ihomes at nearly 80$ of the confinements taking place annualljin England and Wales, thus playing a very intimate part in tisolution of the problem of maternity and Infant Welfare j  whilthe Approved Booietiee oan provide medioal attendance and trtlment for the dependanto of insured pereons.   I think, therefthat, provided that Xneurance Committees may  be similarlyempowered, my Department oan then eo-operate  sufficiently wttlLocal Government Board in the consideration of all the new dJaents in thie Maternity and Infant Welfare work to secure addco-ordination.                                   (Signed) BOWXH  OORflWALL.                                           31et October,  I9l\
