Rome. To ;-.    S;  of S., London.                          Handed in 11,30 p.m. 1st November 1917.                          Received   2.55 p,m, 2nd November 1917c No. 5,.   November 1st.                     jed       Secret&quot;.   Reference my R.1 and R.2.         You-will have  noticed as showing state of Italian Army that Headquarters, which I have reported already as being full of unarmed stragglers,  is some 40 miles behind Tagliamento, and on  a 25  milfes drive further to rear last night I saw many other stragglers.  The  trains coming from the front are also packed  with  stragglers  much in the same way as the Russians went off.  I was glad  to see Gendarmerie at one place searching railway carriages  and compelling the fugitive soldiers to  descend.   Whole  situation may be termed a military strike  plus  inefficiency of  body of officers from top to bottom.  As  in all strikes where there happens to be a good and determined master  the strike is less pronounced and in these few eases  the troops have behaved well.  Where, on the other hand,  no such master is forthcoming,  which is almost always  the, case,here.,  the strikers do as they like and the evil spreads.   Only 6  or 7 divisions of the 2nd Army have been really  attacked,  as you know, and yet  the whole of that Army of 27 divisions has ceased to have any fighting value while its contagion coupled  with bad staff work,  and consequent fatigue and  confusion,  is fast destroying 3rd Army, v/hich, with the exception of one Corps,  has not been yet attacked at all or even-hard pressed by the  enemy.  To give an example of the situation, when Hamilton made his final visit to Corps Head- quarters for orders he  found they.had fired the village after looting it and had gone off  leaving him there although no enemy was near and there was practically no firing.                                                   The
          The chief point to hear in mind is that a greatpart of the people have always1 opposed the war and the Ministershave failed to remove the opposition whatever may have beentheir efforts.    Further, Gorman propaganda and money havebeen utilised cleverly and both these are naturally much moreeffective in inducing a people not to fight than a similarmeans can ivhose object is persuasion to continue fighting andthat under trying economic conditions.  In this connectionI am told that here, as in Russia, it is not so much a question ofscarcity of necessities of life as bad organisation and consequentbad distribution.          To sum up : I beg the War Cabinet to realizethat political and social conditions here are quite differentfrom those in England in that the utterances of Italian Ministersdo not truly reflect the spirit and intentions of the people.While Sonnino has been advancing schemes of territorialaggrandisement and Cadorna preparing plans of battle many of thepeople and the soldiers here have been quietly wearing a smile ofindifference having no real interest in these schemes and plansand no intention of fighting for them.  I may add that Cadorna1 sCommuniques drafted during the debacle are stated to have beenmuch stronger than those published and were watered down byGovernment orders.   I cannot say if this is true.          There is further no doubt that both the Frenchand we are no longer popular in the country as the Italiansaccuse us of being responsible for keeping Italy in the War.I hear this on all sides.  We have reason to believe that theGermans are not popular with their Allies but I mention thechange of Italian opinion in order to sho?/ that apparently manypeople would now prefer peace to Allied assistance.          I hope to-morrow to see certain Italian Ministersto whom I shall not fail to represent necessity for taking themeasure at the front to which I have alluded in my telegram.
