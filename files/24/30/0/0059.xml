[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet   October 1917.CONFIDENTIAL.MEMORANDUM ON  THE  EDUCATION  BILL,  1917.      I DESIRE to support the suggestion which has been made by  Mr. Barnes to the War Cabinet that the Prime Minister should take  an  opportunity of making  a  declaration to  the  effect  that  the  Government propose to pass the Bill early next session.  My reasons  for taking this ground are as follows :       1st. A very considerable amount of disappointment has been  felt and has been  expressed throughout the country at the post-  ponement  of the Bill, and I fear that, unless some earnest of  the  Governments intentions  be forthcoming, a suspicion will arise that  the  Government is not  seriously desirous of attacking the funda-  mental problems of reconstruction.      2nd. The Bill has secured an amount of agreement unparalleled  in the history of our educational legislation.   Twenty-nine bishops  of the Established Church  have  declared in  its favour,  and  are  reinforced by the  Free Church Council and the  Congregational  Union. . It  is  true  that  the  Roman  Catholics have manifested  apprehensions lest some parts of the Bill may be  injurious  to their  schools and  may conflict with the principles upon  which  Catholic  education  proceeds.  I believe, however,  that  the  apprehensions  entertained in this quarter are devoid of foundation, and  rest upon  a misconception of the purpose and probable working of the clauses-  objected to.   In any case,  the opposition of  the  Roman Catholics,  should it prove to be serious, could be almost  certainly  overcome by  a modification in the  Board&apos;s regulations for secondary schools.  I  should add that, so far  as I have an opportunity of judging,  the  whole body  of  organised  labour is behind  the Bill.   It  has  tho  support of the  Labour party in the House  of  Commons and of  the  trade unions, though in certain regions, such as Preston, there  may be, and probably will be, some local labour opposition to  the  abolition of half-time.  I venture to think that no  measure of far-  reaching social importance has ever  obtained so large a promise of  support in the whole  history of  this country  since the abolition of  slavery.      3rd. It is true that some apprehensions have been expressed by  the  Local Education Authorities  with respect to the administrative  clauses of the Bill, but in the letter which 1  have addressed to  the  Chairman  of the Education Committee of  the London  County  Council I have gone a long way to meet the objections which have  been raised  from this quarter, and  I  do not apprehend that any  serious difficulty will remain if the Local Education Authorities  can  receive an assurance from the Government that at least 50 per cent.  of their approved  educational  expenditure  will be borne by  the  Treasury.   On this point I  am  corresponding  with the Chancellor  of the Exchequer.      4th. The opportunity is unique and will not recur.  There can  be no extension of popular education in this  country which does
 not entail some abridgment of juvenile labour in  the field  of industry.  Indeed,  we should, I take it, all desire to see a greater and more economical use of machinery, an  increased  number  of brain workers, and a reduction  in  the  volume of juvenile labour employed on mechanical tasks.  . It is the object of the Education Bill to  strengthen  these three interconnected tendencies, but it  is clear that the purpose of the Bill cannot  be effected without  some dislocation of labour.  There must be less industrial employment  of young children, a  larger employment of adults, and  an extended use of machinery.   The inconvenience necessarily dependent  upon these changes will  be  very  greatly lightened  by  demobilisation. They will therefore be  much more readily accepted now than they would be at any  time subsequent  to  the war.   Bradford  and Preston will  grumble over the abolition of half-time in any  case, but all our industries have experienced so many shocks during the war that changes which at other times would have seemed formidable, now appear to  be comparatively  insignificant, and there is always the hope that demobilisation will provide  a new source of labour which may take the place, to some extent if  not  entirely, of thelabour displaced by the  extension of the school age.   I repeat, then,that so  favourable  an opportunity for educational reform will notrecur.     5th. Apart from the merits of the specific proposals in the Bill,the country would  greatly benefit by the passage of a measure ofeducation which commanded the general  agreement  of the variousreligious denominations, and  was framed with the sole purpose ofpromoting educational  efficiency.  Nothing would be  more likelyto get us out of the rut of sectarian controversy than the passageof an agreed Bill to  promote popular education.  Such an agreementexists at the present moment.  If we wTait too long  and allow thegenerous atmosphere created by  the common sufferings of the warto be dispersed, I can see very little chance of substantial progressupon rational lines.                                                 II. A. L. F.     October 31, 1917.o
