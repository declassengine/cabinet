As a result of representations from London the          United States War Trade Board and the Embassy at Washington          have  modifled the proposals noted last week for dealing with          Danish livestock and dairy produce.     They now suggest:(1)   That the Panes should be allowed to export     to Gercx,ny not more than 5,000 head of oattle a     week or the equivalent in beef;  that no further     exports to Germany of any agricultural produce,     15.vestock or horses should be sanctioned.( )   That the whole of the Danish surplus of pig and     dairy produce should be exported to the Allies,     and the whole Danish surplus of hides end skins     should bo exported to approved destinations.         Denmark is at present exporting 6,000 head  of  cattleper week to Germany, and the Danish Government have  beenobliged to withdraw the regulation limiting  the  export  ofhorses to 3,000 head per months   Denmark  exported  to Germanyin August 13,700 -^ea&amp;s- of eggs, 1,180 tons  of bacon  and  1,603tons of butter.         H.K. Government have approved the following eugges-tions from Washington;-I  50RWAY.(1)   That the Banish exports of fish and fish produets     to Germany should be limited to 25,000 tons     annually.(2)   That in return for imports from the United States     the Danes should make satisfactory financial     arrangements for facilitating Allied purchases of     Danish produce and continue to deliver their pro-     duce to British ports in Danish boats.(3)   That the exoorts of Danish manufactures to enemy     countries (permitted under the Anglo-Danish     Agreement) be limited- to 08,000 monthly.        The Norwegian Government are becoming alarmed by thegeneral embargo upon Norwegian imports and may be expectedshortly to reach important decisions.    The Korweglan
          Minister in London, in an interview with Lord Robert Cecil,          has discussed the total oestation of Norwegian exports toC         Germany.   He alluded to the possibility of war with Ger-          many, &quot;but admitted that the possibility was remote.                 The Norwegian Government have suggested to our Hinis-          ter in Christiania that discussions should he opened in Nor-          way pari passu with the negotiations at Washington.  There          is a danger that if this favourable moment he lost the          Norwegian Government my attempt to arrange a system of exoh-.          anges with both &quot;belligerents.    The German Minister at          Christiania has gone to Berlin and he will profj&amp;hly be          empowered by the German Government to offer supplies to          Norway in return for Norwegian exports.                  -The negotiations with the Norwegian Mission at          Washington are not for the moment proceeding very satisfac-          torily.   Dr. Hanson is not sure to what extent he is quali-          fied to speak for his Government, and the Norwegian dele-          gates are endeavouring to make piecemeal arrangements which          may prejudice a settlement on more general lines.II ^HSRLAKTg.       No settlement has yet been reached of the Dutch          transit question.   We have intimated to the Dutch Minister          in London that nothing short of an immediate cessation of          the transit of sand and gravel through Dutch territory will          satisfy the British Government;  and the Dutch Minister has          been warned that neutral nations which forfeit the goodwill          of the Allied countries may find themselves after the war          in a serious economic position.    The Dutch Minister for          Foreign Affairs has made a statement of the Dutch case in          the States General.   Public opinion,  however, appears to^         De rather in our favour.    We have authorised the puhli-          oation of a statement in the Butch press in which stress is
s. 13laid on the fact that the transit question is a difficultyof long standing and that It has been necessary for H.M.Government to display considerable patience.   She FrenchGovernment have arranged to hold up Dutch commercialcables concurrently with ourselves ^(sn&amp;ing a settlement.Meanwhile 32,460 tons of sand and 38,820 tons of gravelare reported to have passed from Holland to the WesternFront between October 10th and October 17th.       In a memorandum to the Dutch Mission at Washingtonthe United States War Trade Board State(1)  That no exports of oils or fats will he    licensed for Holland  except for the manu-    faoture of margarine  for the Allies.(2)  !2hat no exports of foodstuffs,  fodder or    other United States materials will he    licensed so long as such commodities are    either (a) exported to  enemy countries,    or (b)  used to release  other foodstuffs    or commodities for export to enemy    countries, or (c)  employed directly or    indirectly in transporting through Dutch    territory materials of  enemy origin or    ownership.(3)  That no American hunkers will he granted    to Dutch ships until  assurances have been    received as to the purposes and destinations    of the cargoes carried.(4)  That Dutch shipping must he as  far as possible    employed in bringing  supplies to the United    States or in carrying supplies  for the    Belgian Relief Commission.       The Italian Government estimate the Italian graindeficit on the harvest year at 4,000,000 tons,  and theyhave deoided that further supplies must at all  costs  he oh-tained.      They have accordingly diverted to  the UnitedStates some 374,000 tons of Italian and neutral shippingat present employed in carrying coal and ore betweenUnited Kingdom and Mediterranean ports.    We have warned
the Italian Government that shipments of British coal toItaly will have to he reduced in proportion to the ton-nag e thus diverted, hut the Italians are apparently pre-pared to face the consequences *   They state that it mayshortly he necessary to extinguish the Italian blast furna*ces.    The Italian Minister of Transport has promised toconsider whether it would not he possible for the Italiangrain ships to conform to a system of triangular voyagesbetween Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States.She saving of tonnage thereby effected might enable us tomeet some part of Italy&apos;s coal requirements.     The War Trade Board have recommended the United StatesGovernment to purchase 85,000,000 bushels of Argentinawheat, maize and oats, including at least 40,000,000bushels of wheat.     The object of the scheme is to securethat portion of the Argentine surplus of cereals whichwoulfi normally he exported to the northern Ueutrals.  TheUnited States Treasury have not yet approved the soheme.     Negotiations are still proceeding at Washington fora comprehensive settlement of the Banish Shipping questionon the lines which we Indicated last week.   Our own nego-tiatlons for additional Danish tonnage are accordingly inabeyance.     She United States are attempting to secure for Alliedservices 150,000 tons of Japanese shipping at a fixedchartering rate of eleven yen.  The Japanese shipowners.
  however, are not prepared to SKifea sacrifices and are  asking nearly twice the rate.     he Japanese Minister  of Communications has legal powers to requisition Japanese  shipping at any rate which he chooses to fix;  Taut he is  not likely to take any drastic action against the powerful  Japanese shipping interests *   !Dhe Japanese  overamsnt may  possibly tend over the ships to the Unitsa States at the  fixed rate and compensate the owners.UBMAHI3B 0AMg M*     ha following is a summary of the  losses to merchant shipping, due to enemy activity,, which  were reported in the period Oet* 19 -  5, 1917, inclusive.
