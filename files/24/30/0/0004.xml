October 1917.SEQJWt-i NAVAL WEEKLY APPRECIATION-No. 22.Week ended 21s  October.NAVAL  OPEKATIONS.    On the loth October the Russian S.N.O. in the Gulf of Riga, with the cruiser &quot; Bayan &quot; Baltic.and a division of destroyers, was scouting towards Irben Strait.   The old Russian battle- 15th Oct.ships &quot; Slava &quot; and &quot; Grazhdanin &quot; were in support towards Moon Sund.   About 3 p.m.German destroyers, supported by heavy ships, forced a passage through Siele Sund, butwere met and engaged by.four modern Russian destroyers.  In the action which tookplace the opponents each lost one destroyer,  and though  at first forced  to retire, theGermans eventually reached Kassar Bay.  The bombardment of Tserel continued duringthe forenoon, but without reply from the Russians, who at 3 p.m. blew up the 12-inchbattery  and set fire  to buildings, &amp;c,  on  the  Sworbe Peninsula.  In  the meantime theGermans appear to  have overrun the  whole of  Osel with  the  exception of the SworbePeninsula, which  was,  however,  completely isolated  by their  southern force.  A con-siderable number  of Russian  troops succeeded in  evacuating Osel from the south-eastcoast, the transports being covered to the  westward by Russian destroyers.    On  the 16th enemy light craft were patrolling  Kassar Bay,  and sweeping operations 16th Oct.were in progress in the Gulf of Riga in  the direction of Arensburg ; at 6  p.m.  Germanwarships were reported off  Arensburg making for Moon Sund, in which  the minefieldhad been already located.  Russian naval  forces were encountered, and an action ensuedat long range, in the course of which the Russians lost the battleship &quot; Slava,&quot;&quot; which wassunk by gunfire between Moon Island  and the  Island of  Schildau.   The remainder ofthe Russian Fleet retired towards the north, and the coast defence batteries at the  entranceto the Moon Sund were in turn engaged and put out of action.   The whole of Osel wasby this time in the hands of the  Germans, who reported the capture of  3,500 prisoners,.numerous guns  and a  considerable amount of  material.  Their aircraft  were alreadymaking use of the Russian aviation stations at Popenholm and Arensburg.  An attemptedlanding  on Dago during the day  was repulsed by the Russians, who also still remainedin occupation of Moon  Island. Run 6 was captured during the night of the 16-17th.    There were no operations of special note on the 17th, the day being  devoted mainly 17th Oct.to clearing up the situation.    At 6.30 a.m. on the 18th the bridgehead opposite Orissar,  which protected the causeway ig^ Oct.connecting Osel with Moon Island was successfully captured by the Germans, and by theend of the day the whole of Moon Island fell into their hands,  bringing the total of prisonersup to about 10,000, and the capture of guns to 50.  Enemy torpedo boats are stated tohave passed the night of 17-18th October off Kuivast, on the east coast of Moon  Island.    By the 19th the Headquarters of the German Fleet had been transferred to Arensburg, 19th Oct.though  Taggalaklet  Bay was still  being  maintained  as  a  supernumerary  base.  Bothanchorages were protected by nets.  The Russians were still  in occupation of Dago ; theyalso held Wormso Sund, with their retreat open to the north.   Mist and rain hamperedoperations generally.    On  the 20th a German force  effected a landing on the  south coast of Dago, and by 20th Oct.the evening it was  reported that good progress had been made.  The German navalforces carried out no operation.  The Russian naval forces were reported to have entirelyevacuated the neighbourhood of Moon Sund, and to have retired with tugs, transports, &amp;c,northwards.    The German official communique, which is not denied  by the Russians, states that 21st Oct.during the 21st German troops reached the east coast of Dago, and by evening the wholeof the island was in their hands.   The Germans also occupied  the Island  of Schildau,situated between Moon Island and the mainland.    Two German  light cruisers of the  latest type  carried out a raid in the North Sea North Sea.during the night of 16th-17th, and on the morning of the 17th, 61 miles east of the Shetlands,  17th Oct.&apos;attacked a mercantile convoy consisting of 12 ships,, escorted by the destroyers &quot;Mary   (C 724)  5Q  10/17  H &amp; S
 -:Rose &quot; and &quot; Strongbow,&quot; : proceeding  from Norway  to the United Kingdom.  The          destroyers engaged the enemy, but were overpowered and sunk by superior gunfire.&apos; The          whole of the crew of the &quot; Mary Rose &quot; were lost except 2 officers and 8 men, who have          been landed, in Norway;  47  officers  and men were lost from the  &quot; Strongbow.&quot;  After          sinking the two destroyers the enemy cruisers fired on, the merchant ships,  10 of  which          were sunk.  Our light cruisers were out in large force, but failed to intercept the enemy          cruisers.Minelaying.     Minelaying operations by submarines have been carried out in the Heligoland Bight,          and additional deep mines have been laid  off the south-west coast of England.Casualties.      The monitor &quot; Terror &quot; was hit by one or two torpedoes and two  or three shell from          enemy destroyers off Dunkirk on the night of 18th-19th,  which resulted in several com-          partments being flooded,  but she was brought in safely and there were no casualties.              The armed merchant  cruiser &quot; Orama &quot; has been torpedoed and sunk in the Atlantic.          but there  were no casualties.              The U.S. destroyer &quot; Cassin &quot; has been torpedoed and badly damaged, but has reached          port.              Two armed trawlers and two drifters have been sunk by mines, and one armed trawler          has been sunk by collision.Flandera.       R.N.A.S. bombing squadrons from Dunkirk have carried  out  raids on enemy aero-          dromes at Varssenaere (on two occasions, when  hits on the sheds  were observed) Engel          and Houttave,  and on three  occasions  on Bruges docks, the total  weight of bombs          dropped being about 11 tons.             A number of offensive patrols have also been carried  out  from Dunkirk and several          engagements with enemy  machines have taken place.   Two of the latter were definitely          and two probably destroyed, and in addition two were forced down.   One of our machines          has not returned.              In aerial  fighting during  the  period  September 23rd October 6th,  R.N.A.S.          squadrons attached to the R.F.C. in France, destroyed 7  enemy machines and drove down          out of control or damaged 15.   An enemy balloon shed was completely destroyed, and troops          and transport have been frequently attacked successfully from low altitudes with machine          gunfire and bombs.  Our squadrons have also co-operated in infantry attacks.Mediter-ranean.    A submarine has fired a few shell into Horns (Tripoli).    A newly established  enemy battery on the Struma front, which was registering onBritish trenches, was silenced by the monitor &quot; M 18.&quot;    Two bombing raids have been carried out on Chanak (east shore of Dardanelles at theNarrows), and a number of heavy bombs dropped in the town.Adriatic.        On October 13th, Italian seaplanes attacked enemy light craft south of Cape Salvore,          dropping 36 bombs.  An explosion was observed on one vessel.              On October 16th, Italian seaplanes attacked enemy Torpedo Boats and minesweepers          near the Istrian coast and drove them into port.Black Sea.      On October 12th, an enemy submarine bombarded the port of Tuapse, but submerged          and disappeared when fired upon by coast batteries.              Russian destroyers operating  on the Anatolian  coast have  destroyed eleven laden          schooners,  and taken 20 prisoners.                                ATTACK UPON ENEMY  SUBMARINES.Submarines      The week under review, especially towards the latter end, has been  marked by aoperating,   recrudescence of intense submarine activity.  Eighteen to 20 large submarines have been          out, of which 12 to 16 have been operating to the west of the British Isles, and in at least          two instances large&apos; boats have passed through the Straits of Dover both on the outward          and homeward voyage.  The areas of greatest activity have been off the  Yorkshire coast          and to the west of the Isle of Wight and a ship has been sunk off the African coast, 400          miles South  of the Canary Islands, by a boat believed to be the  &quot; Submarine Cruiser;&quot;          which first appeared off Madeira and then to the west of Gibraltar.

              The  number  and tonnage of British Vessels  lost this week is much in excess of the          record weeks in September, and it is necessary to go back to the week ending August 25th to          find tomiage losses which exceed those of the present week.              The  tonnage  of Allied and Neutral  Vessels lost this week  also shows some increase.          but it includes 8,414 tons destroyed by the raiders in the North Sea.Losses of       The  table in Appendix I shows in detail the numbers and  tonnage of sailings and ofBritish     losses by submarine and mine of British Merchant  Steamships of over 500 tons grosssteamships,  register.Areas in        The  table in Appendix II is a Comparative Statement of all British Merchant Vesselswhich      sunk, damaged or molested, and of all Allied and Neutral Merchant Vessels sunk in thevessels lost, last two weeks by enemy craft and mine according  to areas.  From this it appears that the          increased enemy activity has taken place in practically all areas and is noticeable as regards          vessels damaged or molested, but not sunk, as well  as regards vessels actually lost.Losses in       The  table in  Appendix III shows by trades as regards British Merchant Steamshipstrades.     the percentage of tonnage sunk by submarine or mine to tonnage sailing to and ,from United          Kingdom ports during the last three weeks. From this it will be seen that notwithstanding          the increase of tonnage lost in overseas trades, the percentage of loss in all United Kingdom          trades  taken together is lower than  in the previous week.  This is  accounted for by the          large increase in coasting and cross-Channel sailings without any corresponding increase in          losses in those sailings.                                           ENEMY  MINES.Minelaying.      The  chief minelaying activity of the enemy has this week been in  the Lowestoft and          Harwich  areas, off Beachy Head, in the vicinity of Milford Haven, and in the approaches          to Lerwick, which have again  been mined after an interval of some weeks, an attempt          to do so  a  fortnight ago having been frustrated by the sinking of the submarine.              Reports have been received which  appear to indicate that the Germans are using          delay release mines, which lie  on the bottom for a period before rising to their intended          position,  and  every  effort is being made to salve  mines of this-description for examina-          tion.  Arrangements have been made for a constant use of  the bottom sweep, which is          the only  means of dealing  with mines of this class.Casualties,      The following table shows the number of Enemy Mines destroyed and British Vessels          sunk by  mine in recent weeks : Week Ended.

One of the four Minesweepers which have been sunk may possibly have been destroyedby an internal explosion and not by mine.                          DEFENCE  AGAINST  SUBMARINE  AND  MINE.Convoy,        During the week 798 ships have  been convoyed as compared with 743 last  week&apos;.          Of the 798 ships convoyed, 409 were engaged in the French Coal Trade and  177 on the          Scandinavia-Lerwick-Humber route, the remaining 212 being engaged on overseas  trade.          104 inward and 108 outward.  There have been 15 losses in convoy this week, one in the          North Atlantic Convoy, two in the Gibraltar Convoy, one engaged  in the French Coal          Trade, and .11 on the Scandinavia-Lerwick-Humber route, which include the 10 vessels          sunk by raiders already referred to under Naval Operations (North Sea).  In addition, oneij          vessel inthe outward convoy from Plymouth was torpedoed and towed into port and&apos; two          vessels sunk in the week ending  7th instant have been notified this week.
    During the week 33 additional Merchant Vessels have been fitted to take defensive Defensivearmament, the number at present fitted being 3,346.                                  aimamen .    The number of guns now available amounts to 3,051.    The number of howitzers and bomb throwers delivered to date is 145, an increase of Offensive9 during the week.                                            .  .  :    Thirty-five additional  Merchant  Vessels have been  fitted with Otter equipment, JJ^Jj^bringing the total  number so fitted up to 597.    Up to the present 163 Merchant Vessels (of which 38 are new ships) have been &quot; dazzle &quot; Dazzle  ;painted, and of these three have so far been sunk and one  molested but escaped.         Paintyig.                           NATIONAL SHIPYARDS.    The arrangements for the construction of Standard Ships in National Shipyards byprisoner of war and other labour unsuitable for private yards are making progress.    Four yards have been decided upon  and the sites  for three definitely selected atChepstow, Beachley and Portbury.  These three  yards together will have 26 slips, eachcapable of accommodating a Standard Ship, and it is intended that the fourth yard shallhave 6 slips.    Preliminary work has commenced at Chepstow and Beachley, nearly 600 men being-employed at the latter place,  and as regards Portbury, plans of railway access and watermains have been prepared and the plan of general layout of the berths is well in hand.               MOVEMENTS  OF GERMAN  MERCHANT SHIPS.    Six enemy merchant ships have this week arrived at Norwegian ports (outside theCattegat), and nine have left.   None have arrived at or left Rotterdam.                     FOREIGN  NAVAL INTELLIGENCE.                                   FRANCE.    There are about 40  vessels completing for  the various divisions of patrols, chieflyfor the Channel and the Atlantic.  Besides these, six Submarine Chasers built in America,have arrived in France, and six more are expected shortly.    Of the 12 Destroyers built in Japan, five are at Toulon and should shortly be incommission.  The remainder are expected at Port Said immediately.    A new division of  &quot; Mine Seekers &quot; (Recherche de Mines) has  been established,composed  of 10 Vedettes.  They are attached to the North Sea and Eastern  . ChannelDivision.                                   PORTUGAL.    The three submarines built at Fiat San Giorgio Yard, Spezia, are complete and readyfor sea with Portuguese crews on board.   They have a radius of 1,200 miles and a surfacespeed of 14  knots, and,  if the crews can be trained, these craft may prove, useful forpatrolling the Portuguese coast.                                     SPAIN.    The enemy submarine interned at Ferrol has had her motors dismantled  and theofficers and men have been interned in the interior.    The escape of U.B. 49 from Cadiz may result to our advantage^ since the honourof the Spaniard has been touched ; even the pro-Germans are annoyed.   &apos;    The Spanish Government took immediate action in relieving the officers in commandat the port, as well as the subordinate officer concerned.  The rumour that a pilot wentout with the submarine appears to  be unfounded.  A reserve  officer endeavoured tostop her in a tug, but without success.                          HD  .  ;!;:::
    There appears to be a renewal of attacks on shipping inside territorial waters, twoItalian and one Greek ship having been sunk on 13th October near Cape Palos, apparentlyin Spanish waters, and one French ship on 14th September off Cape Tortosa, within   milesof the shore with the submarine inside her.  Cape Palos is a few miles only from Cartagenawhere many ships of the Spanish  Navy are based.                                     SWEDEN.    Some interest is being shown by the press in the possibility of a German attack onand seizure of the Aland Islands, which would mean that &quot; the Russian  danger willdisappear, but will be replaced by a German one.  Sweden cannot view with indifferencethe German occupation of territory just outside Stockholm.&quot;    The smuggling of arms into Finland from Swedish ports in the north of the Gulf ofBothnia has been somewhat in evidence.                                      CHINA.    The Chinese Government will let us have such few guns as she can for the defensivearmament of merchant ships, but until things in the south settle down and  the ships atCanton return to their allegiance  to the Central Government there is little hope of anyconsiderable measure  of  assistance.  On October 21st Shanghai Arsenal  was instructedto hand over 11 4-7-inch guns and mountings.                                      JAPAN.    Apart from regular&apos; lines of steamships, some 70 Japanese vessels of roughly 250,000tons should be available for War Service.  About 20 of these are already chartered to theAllies;  and the U.S.A. are endeavouring to obtain the other  50 of about 150,000 tonsin return for a release of steel  for shipbuilding purposes.                                      SlAM,    The Siamese  Government have indicated that they do not desire to charter to theAllies the enemy  ships seized by them, except for purposes destined to relieve the warsituation in  Europe.  This will  frustrate the Japanese  endeavours to  obtain a share ofthe tonnage  for their own use, as opposed to a war use.NAVAL STAFF,    252A October, 1917.[APPENDICES.
