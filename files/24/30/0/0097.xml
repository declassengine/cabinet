8ECRE . &apos;                              Intelligence Bureau,                                  Department of Information.                                         iW/016.                 Weekly Report on France.  XV*                        (Hov.  1st. 1917.)     The Report of Oct. 18th spoke of the smallness  of the Govern-ment majority in a critical debate and the probability of a crisisand a new Prime Minister.    The crisis followed almost immediately,though the Cabinet subsequently had a much better division; butnevertheless it has not at present involved a change of PrimeMinister *   There were a few days of uncertainty:  resignationsoffered and refused by the President: with the  curious resultthat u. Painleve, who sincerely wished to resign,  or at mostretain only the Ministry of War, remains Prime  Ministers whileM.  Ribot, who definitely refused to resign, has been replacedby M* Sarthou, who previously held office without  a  portfolio.The explanation of this must lie partly in personal  considerationsfor, as M. Augagneur pointed out in interpellating the Governmentpn Oct. 25th, it has alwaus been 1 . Painleve and not VL* Ribotin whom the Chamber has shown lack of confidence.    When theCabinet of M. Painleve made its first appearance M.  Painleve*sspeech was very coldly received and M. Ribofe  tead a great success.The set back over the Malvy affair and the abortive  project of anew law of .libel were setbacks to M. Painleve and  not to M. Ribot:and it is M. Painleve and not H* Ribot who has  provoked the manycontemptuous articles which have appeared in all sections of  thePress describing the Cabinet as nerveless, headless  and sick  todeath before it has grewn up.    One paper expresses  envy ofEngland and the United States both of v/hom have found na Man&quot; tolead them, while M. Painleve,  it is alleged,  may be  many good
                            -  2 -tilings but  is certainly not  that-   Privately admiration is ex-pressed for his intellectual pov/er and high character, but itis felt he  has not the oratorical gift required by a FrenchPrime Minister or the driving  pov/er required by the head of anyGovernment  in any country.     It is  not likely that  the present solution of the crisiswill be very long-lived.   It  is vitiated at the start by anobvious inconsistency.   Just  as M.  Painlevi was in a falseposition from the first because he first wrecked M. Ribot !sCabinet by  refusing to join it on the ground that there were noSocialists  in it and then himself formed a Cabinet without asingle Socialist, so now the only avowable reason for dismissingM. Ribot was the hostility  of  the Left, and especially theSocialists,to v/hat they regarded as his too abrupt dismissal ofthe German  peace proposals communicated to him by Briand: and yethe has been replaced by M.  Barthou, who is far more suspect ofImperialism.   The real reason is no doubt Socialist vengeanceon the refusal of passports for Stockholm: and probably personalfriction in the Cabinet played its part too.   V/hat other changeswere attempted cannot be known in detail.   But it is said thatM, Viviani, who is a fine orator, was asked by M. Painleve&apos; tobecome a sort of Vice President of the Council with the dutyof speaking for the Government; an offer which he declined,preferring  probably to wait  for his chance of returning to thePremiership.   And it is known that efforts were made to bringback the Socialists.   But  they still claim to dictate their ownconditions, and no Prime Minister is yet prepared to submit totheir arrogance.     It is  understood that  M.  Thomas desired,  if he joined, tohave either the War Office  or  the Foreiga Office.   It wasimpossible  to concede such demands.   His acceptance of his
                                    tparty&apos;s views about Stockholm made hsm impossible as a Foreign Ministerand against his1 going to the V7ar Office thore are two sufficientreasons.    One is that M.  Painleve,  whose success there is aa generallyrecognised as his failure as Prime Minister,  does not wish to give itup, and another is that General  . detain,  who  is said not to be a par-ticularly easy man to work with,  gets on Very well with M. Painleveand does  not like M.  Thomas.  So the Socialists still stand out, andthe crisis has ended by leaving  all the same  Ministers in office withthe single exception of M.  Ribot.    No one, however, expects thingsto go on  as they are for more than a few weeks, and it is remarked thatwith M.  Ribot the Cabinet had a  majority of 346 - 74 in its lastdivision,  while in its first without him its  majority is o$ly 288 -137.   It is true that the former majority was somewhat artificial,being swollen by a slanderous attack on a personal friend of M.Painleve&apos;s and by fears of an attempt to  bring about a return to powerof M.  Clemenceau.    But still a  Government which resigns after a                                          verymajority of 272 is not very likely tcjfeel/secure with one of 151.   The redaction was due partly  to M. Painleves weakness and dulnessin the Tribune - and it is said  that members  yawned and talked whilehe spoke  - but more to what the  Imperialist Press considers M.Barthou&apos;s strength.    The first  interpellates  M. Augagneur,  entirelyfailed to get a word out of M. Painleve rs to why he had dismissed II.Ribot.    The second,  a Socialist ,  had much more success in drawingM. Barthou to speak of the war aims of France.    His object was  tocontrast  the statement made by M.  Painleve when he took office  withcertain Imperialistic utterances made by  M. Barthou during the  courseof the war and to ask for an assurance that the former and not  thelatter inspired the policy of the  Foreign Minister.    The wordsspecially quoted from M.  Painleve  were &quot;if France pursues this war itis for the sake neither of conquest nor of vengeance:   it is  to  defend
iher liberty at the same time with that of  the world.    Her claims  areIthose  of bare right and are irrespective of  the  fate  of battles;   andIher object is the conclusion of a peace which shall not be one  of[force,  containing in it the germ of future wars, but  a  peace of[rjiustiwe, in which efficacious guarantees protect the  society of na- tions  against aggression on the part of any  of  its members&quot;.    In  the face of this he set various utterances of  M. Barthou  about &apos;holy hatred&apos; and about the unwisdom of prematurely defining  the annexations which  Prance might find necessary at the end of the war.    When IL Barthou rose to reply he came almost immediately to  this matter of French war aims.   He difinec  tfcem as three-fold;  restitu- tions,  that is of Alsace-Lorraine, which he  described as simply som$ invaded departments just like those occupied by the Germans ftr the last three years:  second, reparation, if the damage caused by German savagery in the invaded districts:  and thirdly guarantees.   While defining the first two he carried the whole  Chamber enthusiastically with him.  With the third he put himself into opposition with all  the left.   For though he repudiated energetically  any desire for a policy of aggression or annexation, or one of claims thut would expend as circumstances might rllow (urix a rcllonges) he  entirely declined  to lend himself to  &apos;premature and dangerous precisions1  about the  nature of the guarantees that might be necessary.   He  taunted the Socialists with the fact that in the Secret Session some of them had alluded  to the possible necessity of looking for a guarantee of  future peace, not merely in the democratization of Germany, but in  the neutrali3a- tion of certain territories, to which they replied that the neutralisa-Hions  which they had suggested were part of  the  organisation of a Society of Nations and totally distinct from any that might be  brought about  by force and would always invite force to  annul them.   Already embroiled with the Socialists by this, he  made matters  worse  by
V f declaring  that only  the  conditions  of the war,-  only the nature of the  iotory, could determine the  conditions  of peace.    These words very naturally  seemed  inconsistent with  the words of M.  ?ainleve already auoted,  and at once  brought up M. Thomas to point  out the difference and demand explanation.   He  did  not get a very clear answer. ,  K. peinleve and M. Barthou  each  rose again  to declare  that they were in complete agreement.   But it  was  felt that they had used very different  language and had not disproved^ the assertion that they held a different attitude towards  conditions  of peace;   and the result was that 137 Socialists  and  others voted against the Government.   To  an outside  reader  of the deabte it does not appear that II. Barthou, in spite of his reputation,  managed his case very skilfully. Unless he  really  contemplated a policy of annexations (which he denied. and in which he must well know that he could neither carry France nor                               5              easily her Allies with him) it  seems ad  if he might/have met M.Thomas by explaining that all  he meant  was, what is really obvious,  that the nature of  the guarantees of peace which  may be  necessary must depend on the nature of  our victory  and  on the  condition of Germany at the end of the war.   T/ith a democratic Germany and a visibly defeated German army less  would be needed  than with an unaltered German Empire which  had  merely  found it expedient to come to  terms.   However, the many interruptions  which came from  the Right during the the debate and showed all the old Chauvinistic  spirit of mere revengevere proof enough that the Socialist insistence en  principle,  and on a peace  that will not  orovoke future  wars,  is by  no means unnecessary. The difficulty with  them e and considering thefcr power in the Chamber   is  a  serious difficulty -  is that,  while they are mostly bothhonest and patriotic, they are still  eo  much the dupes of mere  phrases&quot;that they  are liable blindly  to swallow  such formulas as &apos;IJo  annexa-tions  and  no indemnities&apos; without analysing their meaning or
                           6.suspecting their German origin,  and to imagine that the mere constitu-tion of a &apos;Society of Nations&apos;  - without waiting for a monthTsexperience of its working - is  enough to ensure the neutrality ofterritories and to make disarmament practicable.   It is doubtfulwhether they will be.satisfied  with the announcement made by M. Barthouthat M. Ribot before  leaving office had appointed a commission toprepare the organisation of a Society of Nations in the hope of sub-mitting its scheme to an international commission later on.   That willclearly not be a short process:   and patience is not a Socialistcharacteristic.    Their faith removes mountains by declaring they donot exist.   But one may believe that it would be the greatest ofcrimes to iet that great goal pass out of sight without believingthat it cr.n be attained to-morrow by a stroke of the pen.   Meanwhile the political result of the d?b; te is to make theMinisterial future still more uncertain.   M. Prinleve gained nostrength by it,  and M.  Barthou,  who had been expected to succeed in afew weeks to the Premiership, and probably with the co-eperation of  ,the Socialists,  has placed himself in hopeless opposition to themwithout apparently giving any particular satisfaction to the non-Socialist Majority, by whose co-operation,  if he had had it whole-heartedly,  he might even have defied Socialist opposition and governedwithout it,  - which was a solution some people expected.   But asthings are,  the Socialist press  seems scarcely to exaggerate thegeneral impression when it declares as it does that the debate haskilled the Barthou Cabinet before it was hatched.    And as no oneexpects M.  Painleve to  last,  the question is who will succeed.   Oneobserver says,  Viviani,  if things go well with the Allies,  Briand,  asthe strongest man if  things go  badly.    We shall see.
