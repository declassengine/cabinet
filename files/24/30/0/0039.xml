II   ..i   - - &apos;    &quot; &quot;LI       M.  .  ^          With reference to War Cabinet 259 (l), I circulate a copy \-of the letter which Lt,Gen, Dessino, Chief of the Russian ktlitaryMission in this country had prepared for publication&quot;tear Sir,          The Austroverman offensive on the Eastern part of theItalian front has caused a great deal of comment from the Britishpress, owing to the articles which Correspondents  in Italy havesent here.  The articles differ, but almost all speak of Russiafsinactivity as the cause of a large number of troops having beentransferred to Italy, and some articles are written ironicallyat Russians expense.  For example, the following phrasee- appear -in the papers.            * * .          &quot;indeed it might be said that the Germans have trans;ferre4their Russian front here11 and &quot;Goodbye Russia, etc&quot;.  The figureswhich appear in the papers referring to the transfer of men from theRussian front are enormous.  They amount to as many as 300,000 men*I do not know where suc  information comes from,but actually thefollowing troops have been transferred to Italy,          2 German Divisions from Prance, four German Divisions(L doubtful) from Roumania and Galicia and three AustrianDivisions from Galicia.  AS seen, these troops have not only comefrom the Russian but also from the Roumanian and French fronts.The total number of troops transferred does not exceed 80,000 men,          86 German Infantry and 10 German Cavalry Divisions, 33Austrian Infantry and 11 Austrian Cavalry Divisions and 7 Infantryand two Cavalry Divisions of Turks and Bulgarians continue toremalii on the Russian front.          On the Italian front including the German and AustrianDivisions transferred there recently there are altogether 50hostile divisions opposed to the whole Italian front.  X doubtwhether such articles in the Press are useful in furtheringrelations between Russia and England,  towards which end differentAnglo^Russian Institutions are already at work.          All this tends to create ill feeling in Great Britaintowards Russia and when the news reaches Russia will certainly &apos;provoke the Russian nation,          .y.l this is exactly what Germany wants,  and she isspreading her propaganda wit^h this intention.          &quot;During the war every time divisions have been transferredfrom the Russian front the British press mentioned the fact  omittingto state *that other divisions v/ere transferred to replace them fromother fronts.          This&quot;inter-movement of troops netween and along frontshappens constantly but the Press only seems to pick out themovements which give the impression that additional troops are :.being transferred to the British front.                                                              Th-*
of r          The opinion that the Russian front is inactive is notcorrect; local fighting is constantly taking place in Europe aswell as in Asia,  and the hostile troops are &quot;being held on eachfront.          Unfortunately, nothing appears in the Press about allthis.  It is not  my work to write about this nor have I the.time to do so.          I cannot, however, refrain from comparing the foregoingwith the fact that when General Brusiloff advanced last summer inGalicia and eighteen divisions were transferred from other frontsand from the interior of Germany the Russian Press did not complainor write ironical articles.          I should like to point out that my name is not Bessinoas printed in my last article but Bessinc&quot;.DERBY.30th October,  1917.
