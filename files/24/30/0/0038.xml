(This Pocwmtnt is the Property ofHis Britannic Majesty^ Government.)----- -- nrrTTE TOPERATIONS.From::r-Gener.il Delme Radcliffe, Italy;.To:-G . I. G.S.War Office,            29,10,17.. &quot;Handed in at 7,10.p,m,Received at 10,25,p,m.517.Your 44050 of 27th October,Personal and Secret..edI have been doing my utmost to steady ItalianHeadquarters and have used all the arguments you mentionand every other (? means) I could think of &quot;with I thinksome success.   There vss no real panic here as the seniorofficers did not lose their heads and excitement Issubsiding.          The real cause of the trouble was the deter-mination of a portion of the troops to leave the field.Defection of troops undoubtedly compromised the positionof 2nd Army and also 3rd Army and Cadorna decided towithdraw both armies and cut his losses in materialbefore worse could happen/ which I think would un-doubtedly have occurred had he not withdrawn when he did.On the left flank of 2nd Army it was not a question oftroops fighting moderately well, but of their fightingat all,   There is still much to be explained in themain but it appears that German3 marched from Tolmlnoto Gaporetto without any resistance whatever.  As far asI can judge the rest of the army seems to be pullingitself together after great surprise of the first fewdays and to be making its way back in fair order to theline of the Tagliamento,   Affair was not a panic due toaction of tne enemy so much as a disaster brought aboutby
                                                          9 q 9                           2.by the premeditated and deliberate misconduct of a  section ofthe troops which had been contaminated by the demoralisinginfluences emanating from the Vatican, the Socialists.Pacifists and Pro-German agents,          It remains to be seen to what extent these influerioeshave affected the army and I am beginning to hope that- themischief is less widespread than first seemed probable, as thebulk of the troops appear to be withdrawing now in  an orderlyand soldierlike manner, instead of having all thrown down  theirweapons and walking off which is it appears, what the organisersof the trouble were aiming at,  I therefore still trust that  thesituation will be retrieved and Italian army got into fightingshape again.  Country as a whole seems to be taking matter veryquietly and it is hoped by ministers Bissolati,  Commandini,Giardino and others I have seen here that the harm done can bearrested and remedied.  -          There is no doubty  as you say,  Italian army Isnumerically strong enough to  atop the hostile advance.   Themisfortune would never have occurred if Italian troops  had allfought up to their own average performance.   But there  are somany unknown factors at present both as regards  enemy!s strengthand intention and the real extent of the  undermining of fightingvalue of the Italians that Cadorna felt he must  invoke  any aidBritish and French could give to assist him  in restoringsituation.          I never reported having burnt my archives, but onlyunnecessary papers and  books  for which no transport  could havebeen supplied.
