SECRET.Prom:  CI.G.S,  Italian Headquarters.To:Secretary of State for War,London.Handed in 5.55 p,xn. 31.10,17.Received 8.45.a.m. 1.11,17.R.1, October 31st. Secret.       Tile situation is bad.  The original attack came as a com-plete surprise and it succeeded to such an extent that there wasno time to close breach.  I am told by Cadorna that breach wasdue to treason on the part of his troops who made no effort tooppose attack.   Everybody then apparently lost their heads andlarge numbers of 2nd Army laid doim arms and went to the rear,.This Amy has ceased to exist as such and &quot;this town like many-others is full of unarmed soldiers from the front who are movingabout apathetically with apparently no interest in the War.Prom the total stock of ammunition about two thirds are stored.in the West and therefore enemy has taken only what he found ofthe remaining one third.  Some of this, but probably not much,was got av/ay and apparently none of it was destroyed.  Of coursemuch material and large supplies of all kinds have been lost.Cadorna is trying to get his troops on this side of Tagliamento -but as the greatest confusion prevails, I fear he will losemany.  This is due to several causes  \A) There is no real command anywhere. There is much jabber-ing but no one is catching hold of things and getting them clone,  (B) Communications-between units have been lost and even upto to-day Cadorna cannot say where 2nd Army and some of the3rd Army is.  (C) Roads are hopelessly blocked.(D)
\   1  (D) The important bridges at Codroipo were destroyed bysome panicy person and the troops due to cross there werethereby cut off and are now crowding down to.cross furtherSouth by bridges already congested.     (E) Fugitives from the 2nd Army are mixed up with 3rd Armyand this latter is tending to the same disorder as the 2ndArmy.     Result of all above is that Cadorna will be luckyif he reach the Piave with 25 more or less intact Divisionsincluding those of the 4th Army and Carnia force whoserearward movement towards the Piave has commenced.  Fochand I have had long Interview with Cadorna and Impressedupon him the necessity of more energy on the part ofCommanders and Staffs who apparently are all in theiroffices instead of being outside and we have also emphasizedthe need of establishing secure and orderly crossing placesat the several rivers.  The whole question is  one of organisa-tion and energy and both these essentials are  absent.  I amto see Cadorna again to-day and will telegraph result.Headquarters here are probably moving to-morrow and as Ican do no more good here I leave to-night for  Rome whereinterview with certain Ministers may be useful.
