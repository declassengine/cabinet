ITTEES AND REPORTS                 OH RECONS T11UGTION QUESTIONS.          I think the time has come to decide the policythat should be adopted In regard to the publication of theproceedings of tho.Ministry of Reconstruction.          For immediate purposes there are two questionsfor decision (1) whether any, and if SO) which of the Committeset up by the twoReconstruction Committees and by myselfshould be announced with the terms of. reference and membership(2) which IS any, of the reports which these Committees havepresented should bo published.          As regards the first point there are no longer thesame objections that existed originally to publishing the termof reference and composition of Committees.   I believe it wasfelt, in the early days of reconstruction work that it wouldbo neither politic nor convenient to invite public criticismto a field Of inquiry V.hich-was being explored for theInformation of the Government, and in particular,, thatpublicity would&quot; render the manning of Committees extremelydifficult owing to the many claims for further representationthat would certainly be made.    No such apprehension needbe felt in regard to several of the Committees whichhave cither reported&apos;or are about to do so.   The. advantagesof.publication, are that the air. of mystery which someoritics have felt to bo hanging over the work.of reconstruct!&apos;.will bo largely :dispollod, and the Country will be informedat least as to the general character of the questions                                                  which
which are being investigated.The following Committees have  already be. n announced:-          1.   Committee on Commercial and Industrial  Policy.          2.

This would involve  tho omission  of the  Committeeson war Pledges and the preparation  of  an Economic Handbookwhich it would bo inQ.i;pcdicntto announce and the Committee onEducation,.which ceased to meet after  the  appointment of Mr.Pishor.   There remains the question whether it.is expedient topublish the personnel and terms of  reference of Lord Haldane&apos;sCommittee on tho  Machinery of Government.   They  are as  follows          The Viscount Haldane of Clean, 0.1.1.,  II.T.  (CHAIRMAN).          The Right Hon;. E*S.. Montagu, H.P.,          Sir R.L. Morant, K.CvB.,          The Right Hon.

I ami bound to say that I  see no reason why these particulars should not now be given*      As tp reports the following have up to the present been published    It  Gommittoe on Comwaroial and Industrial Policy:-           Lettor to tho Prime minister and Resolution           with regard to ir\p rial ^reference,.    2*  Agricultural Policy Conwittoe?-           &apos; Part lf of tlxo Final Report,    5,  Oomhittoe on the Relations botwecn Employers        and Employeds-           First Interim Report of Joint Standing           Industrial Councils.    4f  Board of Education Oo-iriitteo on Juvenile        Education in relation to e roloymont aftor tho        War :-           Interim and Final Reports and evidence,   - 5,  Board of Trade Committee on financial facilities        of Trade after the war.        I will.now take seriatir: the unpublished reports.. Gorriittoe on Co:-wereial and Industrial Policy.     (a)  Reports on the treatment of imports         and exports during the tra-nsition period:^         These raise ouestions affecting our relations         with neutral as well as eneny countrios, which         Cannot safely be published.
 (b)  Essential Industries ?-      This report can1 I think, be better      discussed without publicity? its      publication would raise a storm of      ficcal controversy, and I imagine      every industry would put forward      claims that they wore essential. (0)  Mineral Surveys (Letter to the Prime      Minirter)      Tho whole question is still undor      discussion. (d)  Shipbuilding (Letter to the Prime      Minister onclosing memorandum bv tho     &apos; Board of Trade Shipping and Shipbuilding      Committee:-&apos;      I understand that tho War Cabinet have      generally accepted the case as stated      and that action is being taken,   There      appear to be no grounds for publication^Army Demobilisation Qornnittoe.      lot and 2nd Interim Reports:-      So soon as the Mar Cabinet havo given      their decision with regard to tho     .policy advocated In these reports I      think it would bo wi/o to publish      the proposals.Ministry of Health Committee,      There arc obvious reasons of policy      against publishing this report at present.Forestry OormiittoOo      The report of this Committee might      be published so soon as the War      Cabinet havo come to a decision as to      its roconmondations *Coal Conservation QoTdttoe. (a)  Intorim Report on geological survey:-      I do not think that this report Is of      sufficient interest to merit publication. (b)  Interim Report on Electric Power Supply;-      I understand that both the President of      the ^oard of Trade and Sir A. Williamson      who is Chairman of tho Board of Trade      Committee: on Electric - Power Supply,      would now welcome the publication&quot;of this      roport and I offor no objection.
C. Acquisition of Powers Committee.

The question of simplifying and expediting the procedure on provisional orders and private bills overlaps so much with the enquiry on Land Acquisition, that it would, I think, be more convenient to await the report of that Committee, and publish the two reports together.

7. Women&apos;s Employment Committee.

(a) Memorandum on assistance in finding employment.

(b) Memorandum on women&apos;s wages after the war.

(c) Observations of the clerical and commercial group on (a) above.

These memoranda are being considered by the Civil War Workers Committee, and by the Departments concerned. I do not recommend publication until a decision has been reached on their recommendations.

I have a report from the panel of the old Reconstruction Committee on Housing which I should not propose to publish whilst negotiations are going on with the Department concerned; and on the same grounds I would deprecate the publication of the report of the Ministry of Health Committee.

The reports of the various Board of Trade Committees are now under review by the Committee on Commercial and Industrial Policy and I agree with the proposals which the President of the Board of Trade has placed before the Cabinet, that certain passages which do not raise matters of policy should be published in the board of Trade Journal.

C.A.



1. SUMMARY OF ? LEGISLATION.

A classified analysis of temporary war measure has been prepared as a basis for the consideration of the prolongation, amendment or repeal of these measures at the end of the War.

This summary is now before the Legal Committee appointed by the Attorney General to interpret the meaning of the words "Termination of the War".

2. PUBLIC WORKS AFTER THE WAR.

Steps have been taken to obtain through the Departments concerned a register of those public works which could be made available immediately on the termination of the War should the state of employment make such a step necessary.

3. PHYSICAL TRAINING.

This enquiry has been conducted by a member of the staff of the Ministry, who is bringing together all the most recent information which is available on this question. The enquiry was undertaken the concurrence of the President of the Board of Education.

4. JUVENILLE LABOUR AND APPRENTICESHIP.

This enquiry is being conducted by members of my staff with the assistance and approval of the Ministry of Labour and the Board of Education. In particular the question of juveniles who have been prematurely exempted for war work, is being investigated.

5. UNEMPLOYMENT.

This was an informal enquiry undertaken during the time 

 
 of the old Reconstruction Committee in order to make a survey of the probable amount of unemployment to be anticipated at the end of the War.

6. HOUSING.

The results of this enquiry, which was undertaken by a panel of the old Reconstruction Committee, have been placed at the disposal of the President of the Local Government Beard.

The various professional bodies have been circularised with a view to ascertaining what changes in the conditions of entry are likely to be introduced as a result of the war, and what is the number of students now serving with the Forces. The answers to this circular letter have been collated, and are now before the Sub-Committee of the Army Demobilisation Committee which is dealing with the resettlement of officers and men of the officer class in civil life.

9. EMIGRATION.

A circular letter was addressed to the various Departments concerned with this problem, and the results of that enquiry were placed before the Empire Settlement Committee.

The original Reconstruction Committee, invited Prof. W.M. Geldart to prepare a full memorandum setting out the present position.

11. TRUSTS AND EMPLOYERS CO?INATIONS.
