1749SECRET.    Intelligence Bureau,Department . ci Information.FSV//012Weeklj? Report cn Snain,  XII.     (Oct. 26th, 1917)   The principal events in ipain since the issue of the Report ofCct. 4th are the abolition of Martial Law which tock place on Oct.7th cr 8th and the restoration of - Constitutional-Guarantees whichhave been suspended since the middle of Junet   The decree terminatingthe suspension was signed by the King cn Oct. 18th.   These two things are not the sane though they are constantly con-fused by the English and French Press in speaking of Spanish affairs.The Constitutional Guarantees are certain rights assured to Spaniardsby the Constitution.   They provide for a right Of trial immediatelyafter arrest, which may be compared to our Habeas Corpus Act;  forthe inviolability of a Spanish residence except under the *rder of aCourt of Law which may be compared to out doctrine of an Englishman&apos;shouse is his castle;  and for the right to hold meetings and expressopinions in the Press which is practioally our doctrine of freespeech.  But the Constitution itself declares that these guarantees&quot;nay be suspended when the State is in danger, and the proviso hasbeen freely resorted to by most Spanish Governments.    They easilyevade the requirement that the consent of Parliament must be obtainedif it is sitting, by taking care that it is not sitting.   The latePrime Minister, the Marquis of Alhunemas,  never met the Cortez, nor,so.far, has Senor Dato.   It appears that the suspension of theGuarantees is a necessary preliminary to the proclcmation ofInitial Law and a State of Siege:  but the one does not involve theother.   For instance Count Romanones suspended the Guarantees fromMarch last till his resignation in April,  but he did not proclaimMartial Law.
    If  the restoration of the Guarantees  is  fully  carried out it willit involve the abolition of the Strict  Censorship which  has so  long helped to darken still further an already obscure political  situa- tion.   The act itself would seem to indicate that the  storm of the abortive revolution has now calmed down, that the country is getting nearer to a normal condition and that the Government  feels stronger and safer than it did.   But the nosition of the Cabinet, and  even of the King,  is a  very difficult one.   On the one hand there are  the Republican and extreme Liberal politicians who, with a good deal of support  from public&apos; opinion,  generally^ demand drastic reforms in the  whole  political system, such as those put forward a week ago by a  body  of Deputies, who insist that Suspension of the Guarantees must  never exceed fifteen days,  that Parliament muot meet  every year, that all the Senators should    in future be chosen by election and  that  it. should be recognised that &quot;the Sovereign power resides  fundamentally in the people&quot;.   On the other hand there are the  official politicians,  mostly elderly men who,  as  several of them told an English enquirer the other day,  declare  that the  Constitution as it is is  quite elastic enough to satisfy the demands of  any reasonable reformer.    The decisive word roots with the Army, but  it:; attitude remains uncertain.    It ie described as  in a state of &apos;respectful rebellion&apos; end Count Romanones took o grave view of its  arrogance in   conversation he had with the British Ambcssador :: month  ago. Our Military Attache has himself seen a circular sent out by the Central Committee of the Officers.to their members which io very hostile to the Government,  accusing them of felling to prevent the revolutionary strike,  and deliberately forcing on the \rmy the u:a- popularity of suppressing it.    There has also been friction between the Army and Scnor Guerra,  the Minister of the Interior,- whoso
dismissal the officers are said t*, have, vainly demanded of the PrimeMinister.   There docs not appear to he any alliance between themand the Republican Left,  and Sonor Mnura,  the statesman whom theywere cuppesed to  favour,  has disgusted them by declaring that if hereturned to power he would abolish their Juntas cr Committees.  Theirattitude is,  therefore,  not a party one,  net Conservative or Repub-lican,  thst is.    Their movement is avowedly professional,  andoctencibly patriotic    It is welcomed by r theoretical Radical likeSenor Castillejo,  the educati-nal reformer, who was lately in England,r-s being t- Syndicalist movement:  end it has some justification inthe combination  of cheeseparing end favouritism which made the attain-ment of efficiency in the Spanish Army impossible.    T- this pr:-fessional movement they give a colour of general patriorism by do-ncuncing the present political system and demanding its aclition infavour jf something more honest and more alive..   Within the last few days they appear to have publicly brought for-ward the demands  for political reform which they drew up at the timeit their successful pr:nunoiamientc in June,  and it is announced thatthey mean to lay  their demands before the  Zing,  which could hardlyfail to provoke a political crisis.   It seems surprising that they should wish to turn cut Sonor Dat),who has dome do much for them during the  last few months.    Perhapsthe explanation  is that he only partially yielded to them in the matterthey had most at  heart.    They detested Sencr Domingo,  the  RepublicanDeputy, for his  criticisms of the Army and, having crrested him in tholate disturbances,  were determined to wreak their vengeance on him.It is at least extremely doubtful whether  his arrest was legal:   forDeputies cannot  legally be arrested except when caught in &apos;flagra:;tedelict-?&apos;&apos;, in the  very act cf crime:   and  he was arrested not in thestreet but afterwards in his sister&apos;s house.    And it is certain that
the  lav: requires that Deputies  must  be  tried by the Supreme Court,5j5v7  although Sen.;r Date yielded so far  to  the Officers as net tointerfere with the crrcst.  to ignore the. or:test.-; :f the Pnrli^mcitTy^leaders requiring that the  Icevo of  the  Oh amber should bo asked inaccordance with th* Constitution, ?t3d to cllcw Scncr Dr:miago&apos;3 j:--ilor&apos;sto treat him very harshly,  yet  he did sot  give way s) f..r .o tc allowof his trial by 0-5urt Martial which  rairrht  have resulted ia his bcinrshot.   And flor thi3 Count  Romaaonos thinks  tho officers have -notfcrrivea Sencr Date and may try to force his dismissal o:i the Kin.;?,A few more weeks will show.   Sonor  Date has lasted much longer al-ready than his enemies expected, and ho  may  weather this storm too.   Meanwhile one  can only repeat that thepllies have no reason  to desire his  fall.    His newspaper,  the Epoco, i3 habitually friendly to us  and  confident in our ultimate victory.   And this attitude is seen in the actions of the Government whose neutrality is far more friendly than that of its predecessor.   The recent escape of a German submarine,  the  fault of subordinates rather $hen of the Ministry, will probably accentuate this,    For the German officer&apos;s betrayal of his word o  honour has,  all accounts agree,  greatly exasperated Spanish opinion even in Germanophil quarters;  and if the submarine is not returned the hands cf the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister who are both friendly tc us,  will  be strengthened to our adsanta^e. They have already showed their  friendliness  by the successful course of the negotiations for the revised Cortina  agreement providing uswith Spanish ore.    This now only  awaits tho settlement of diffi- culties caused  by the state of  the exchange.    /nd another sign of the same attitude is  shorn in their action  in  deporting certain ac-tive German agents  from Morocco.    Probably  here  as in the affair of&quot;the submarine and in  other affairs in other  oountries the  insolenceof the Germans  has  in the long  run played our  game.&apos;J, C. B.
