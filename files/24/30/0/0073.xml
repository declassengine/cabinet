           DEPARTMENT Oil&apos; INFORMATION                   IffiDELLIOBirCB BUREAU.WEEKLY   REPORT   ON   GERMANY.       30 October, 1917.     1.     Quite apart from military considerations, withwhich these reports do not deal, the recent success againstthe Italians will have important political results in Germany.It will certainly be very popular, especially with the&quot;Majority&quot; Socialists, in a way in which no success againsithe Russians would have been.   The prospect of an advance onthe Eastern front has not at any time since the Russian Revo-lution aroused any real enthusiasm in Germany.   There areseveral reasons for this.   Firstly, a real apprehension thatany advance into Russia itself would engage very large bodiesof troops and would thereby commit the army to the squanderingof resources which were more urgently needed on the Westernfront.   There is a traditional feeling that an invasion ofRussia, even if apparently successful, is a military enter-prise which is very dangerous,   Secondly, the Liberals andSocialists, who do not desire a reaction in Russia becausethey fear that that would have an influence on internal affairsin Germany, would much prefer, if not the establishment ofpeace, at least the avoidanoe of open hostilities against theRussian Republic.   Thirdly, they are apprehensive thatfurther occupation of territory would saddle Germany withpolitical responsibilities in Eastern Europe similar to thosewhich arose out of the partition of Poland, which wouldstrengthen the reactionary elements in Germany itself andwould necessarily involve future responsibilities of a kindthat might be highly embarrassing.
            On the other hand, the success against the Italians will he highly popular.   Fighting in the Italian Plains will he free from the associations of gloom and misery which fighting in Russi;  suggests.   Moreover, the feeling against Italy, arising from the method and occasion on which she entered the war, has always been very bitter, even among the Radical and Socialist parties,   At the recent Majority Socialist Conference at WUrzburg, it was declared that had Germany entered into the war under conditions similar to those under which Roumania and Italy entered it, the Majority Socialists would have refused to vote for the war credits. The Germans have never forgotten that Italy was an Ally, and they regard Italian action as gross treachery which deserves a condign punishment.   Thirdly, it will of course be very popular with the Centre Party, for the Catholics in Germany - especially the more aristocratic sections of the party inSilesia and Bavaria - feel in this matter as do the Austrians, and they have never forgotten that the establishment of theKingdom of Italy was closely associated with the overthrow of the temporal authority of the Pope.   This element in political thought was more or less kept in subjection - though even then with difficulty - during the many years when ItalyY/as a member of the Triple Alliance;   Italy,  however,  wasnever really forgiven, and the Italian defeat will be hailedwith great satisfaction.    It is, however,  possible that if this Catholic attitude gains any considerable ascendency, itmay become the source of considerable embarrassment to the German Government.   It would create  a broad fissure between the Catholics and the liberals,  including the bulk of thelational Liberals, and if, as is not  inconceivable,  as a result of further victories, the Catholics  in Austria and in Germany began to talk of the restoration of the temporal
sovereignty, all liberal and Protestant opinion would rise inarms.            Another consequence of this victory which may beof great importance will be its effect on the relations be-tween Germany and Austria.   The fact that the Austrian army,when fighting alone, had been successfully driven back bythe Italians to such an extent that Trieste was in danger, andthat then they have been rescued from this danger by the helpof large German forces under the command of one of the mostdistinguished of German Generals, will necessarily confirmGerman predominance over Austria, and now that German troopsare present, not only on the Eastern Frontier, in Galicia, inthe Bukovina and Transylvania, but also in those olderAustrian provinces nearer to Vienna,  it really means thatAustria is in the complete occupation of the German army.We may be quite sure also that the Austrians will not beallowed to forget that they have had to depend on Germanhelp on every frontier,  against Russia, against Roumania,against Serbia,  and now against Italy.   It is too soon tofciesee what the political results of the cumulative obliga-ticns will be,  but it is not impossible that as time goes onthere will be many in Austria who will regret a victorybought at such a cost-     2.     llo decision has yet been taken -with regard tothe internal crisis in Germany-    The Emperor returned aweek ago;  since that time numerous - often contradictory -reports as to what has happened,  have appeared in the press.Capelle^ resignation has not been accepted;   apparentlyMichaelis has offered his own resignation and the EmperorIs considering whether it shall be accepted or not.    TheInterpretation placed on the situation by the Vorwfirts is
 that if Miohaelis continues in office, this would he a victory for parliamentarism, even though the new Chancellor were one such as Billow, or even the Bavarian Prime-Minister, Count Hertling, who would he more acceptable to the Conservatives than to the  eft.   The Kfllnische geitung maintains that the internal crisis, with or without a change of Cabinet (sib), oan under no circumstances have a weakening effect, and that the hopes of the EntetLte based on internal dissensions in Germany are doomed to disappointment.   There is in truth considerable evidence that the movement represented by the Fatherland Party is of real importance and that it is support- ed by large numbers of electors belonging to the politically unstable lowest middle-olass throughout the country, who are adherents of the parties now denouncing the Fatherland Party in Parliament.   This would produce the impression that the parliamentary criticism of the Government does not command an amount of support in the  country commensurate with the im-portance attached to it in parliamentary and political circles. The effect of the Italian victories will of course be to add strength to the Fatherland Party movement.    In former reports it has been pointed out that any defeat of the Germans mighthave serious political consequences;   what we have now is nota defeat, but a great victory r one perhaps greater than even the German General Staff had themselves anticipated.    Thiswill be very valuable to the German Government and may go far to swamp the growing discontent and dissatisfaction,  and help them to carry on a long through the winter.
 [Ulovernber, 1917.           This report has been held back to await the con- elusion of the Chancellor crisis.   Sven now, however, this appears not to have been reached.   The latest information is that Ivdchaelis resigned and the post of Chancellor was offered to Count Eertling.   It seems, however, at the time of writing that he will be unable to accept it.   The difficulties are many.   Probably the most important is the question as to the separation of the offices, of Chancellor and Prussian X-rime Minister.   It is usual for these to be held together,   Por a short time under Bismarck and also under Caprivi, they were separated, but the 7/orking of the Constitution makes it essen- tial that they should either be held by the same man or that at least there should be the closest understanding between the two.   There are, however, obvious difficulties in appoint- ing a man who is not only a Bavarian,  but a Roman Catholic, to the head of the Prussian Government;  in the case of Prince hohenlohe, this was not so  serious,  partly owing to the very exceptional social and political position ?/hich he held and also because, though a Homan Catholic,  he was a liberal Catholic and did not share  the ultramontane principles which became predominant after 1870;  he belonged to an older generation.   Count Hertling,  however,  was at one time Leader of the Centre or Catholic Party in the Reichstag,  and a few years ago there was a sharp difference of opinion be- tween him and Bethmann Hollweg with  regard to the Jesuits. His appointment as Prussian Minister President would  certainly arouse the strongest objections among  liberals and Socialists, and would be particularly unpopular  in Berlin.      /.s  the mosturgent question of home politics is  Prussian reform,  theposition of the Chancellor  would be  an  impossible one  unless he had control over this;   he  must therefore,  if  he does not
 hold the post himself,, fill it with his own nominee.           It was suggested at one time that Miohaelis should continue to he Minister President;  it is stated, how- ever,. that Hertling refused to accept office if Michaelis con- tinued in any high position.           There are no doubt other points which ?/ould make it difficult for him to secure the necessary backing in the Reichstag.   He has publicly declared himself in favour of the partition of Alsace and Lorraine, Alsace being attached to some South German State (presumably Bavaria), Lorraine to Prussia. This solution, about which there was much public discussion four or -five months ago, would be relentlessly opposed by the Socialists, v/ho are pledged to the autonomy of the Reichsland. His -osition regarding Belgium is not quite clear;  he said on October 11th that &quot;in securing economic and political guar- antees for Germany,  it would be necessary to act with modera- tion and with consideration for the wishes of Belgium&quot;,    This view is not regarded as consistent with those who interpret theReichstag Resolution of July 19 as demanding the unconditionalrestoration of Belgian independence.           According to the latest reports he has not been able to assure himself of sufficient backing in the  Reichstagto warrant him accepting the offered post.   Even if he  hadsecured a provisional majority,  it is not likely that he wouldhave remained long in office,  and he is  hardly the man to givethe necessary internal unity to Germany  and solve the verypressing imperial  and Prussian problems.    It /ould  seem thatno German military successes are able to  solve  the politicaldifficulty.    Germany must have a Government  which has theconfidence of the  military, and also  can  keep in touch withthe Reichstag,   It  has hitherto been impossible to  find any-one who is capable of doing this.    BUlow,  who would be  accept-
 able to the Sight, is detested &quot;by the Emperor and regarded as impossible by the bulk of the other parties;  Euhlmann seems just to have failed;  it is suggested that he allowed himself to be put forward too soon and, by not waiting for the right moment, has much injured his chances.   The difficulty and delay are seriously injuring the position of the Emperor and are demolishing the old confidence in &quot;Government from above&quot;. The Liberal and Socialist papers are now talking of a list of possible Chancellors to be presented to the Kaiser by the parties of the Reichstag, from whom he should choose.   Even two years ago it would have been impossible for anyone in Germany to have made such a suggestion publicly;  that it should be made now shows how much the monarchical authority has weakened.   But It is also almost inconceivable that the Emperor should, with the assent of the military authorities, accept this situation and select *&amp;e**e$*$k9 a Chancellor dictated to him by Parliament, even if the dictation took the form that he should select one from a list of candidates.This is all the more the case that there is not a single name suggested which would command anything like general approval.           Things cannot go on in this way, and if the crisis continues much longer, the Emperor may be driven to accept, as the only solution, the appointment of a man who would have the confidence of the military and would disregard theReichstag.   Ludendorff himself is spoken of.    All reports speak of him as the one dominant personality in Germany.   Hispresent position is that of Quartermaster General,  a postwhich has either been created,  or at least been given a  new importance, apparently in order to enable him to help Hinden-burg in his duties as Chief of the General Staff.    If,  as is generally suggested,  Ludendorff does  all the  work and
 Hindenburg is a figureheadj it does not seem  likely that he could be-fried from his military duties.   Anyhow if he, or any other General, were appointed, he would probable bf with- out the very peculiar qualities required for  keeping in touch with the Reichstag, while the privileges of the Reichstag are such that if there was an open breach between it and the Chancellor, the Government could not be carried on.   A military Chancellor would almost certainly be compelled at the last to ignore the Reichstag and would either not summon it at all or hastily prorogue it any time the conflict threatened to become acute.   Whatever form the conflict took, he would in fact be driven to a military dictatorship.   This is a solution to which of course any country may be driven in the stress of war,  but it is doubtful whether Germany would stand it,  at any rate so long as the war is being conducted away from the German frontier. Things would be different if there were an actual invasion of Germany and the soil of the Fatherland were in danger.           Military successes in fact increase the political difficulties, and they are reaching such a stage that  anything is possible,  among other things even the abdication of the Emperor.    Reports saythat he is falling more and more  under religious  influences,  and spends  much of his time at prayer-meetings.
