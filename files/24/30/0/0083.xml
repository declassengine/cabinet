Colonel Jones9483         (This P^eymsftt it the Property of         His Britannic Majesty fs Government)             / y                                                       /          WELFARE OF THE BLIHD:                         464      MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY FOR... &quot;V! \         SCOTLAND.          I have had under consideration  the Memorandum bythe President of the Local Government  Board  (G.T.2348)  on thesubject of the Report of the Departmental Committee  on  theWelfare of the Blind.  I need not  say  that I am in heartysympathy with his request for money to enable him to carryout the schemes recommended by the Committee.          I regret,  however, that  I am unable to  concur inhis proposal that the suggested Advisory  Committee should actfor the United Kingdom, in -touch with  a special departmentto be set up in the  Local Government Board.          As stated  in the President&apos;s Memorandum, the  LocalGovernment Board would have no statutory  powers to exerciseoutside England and  Wales, and any such powers  would thereforebe exercised in Scotland by the Scottish  Local  GovernmentBoard.          The English Local Government Board,  as  above pointedout, having no jurisdiction in Scotland,  I  am  unable to  regardthe proposed arrangement  as satisfactory.  Although it issuggested by the majority of the  Committee,  I  observe thatthree members of the Committee -  including  the only ScottishMember of Parliament upon it - state  that it would not bepossible in their view for a department  of  the English LocalGovernment Board to exercise control  or  supervision over theSchool Boards or Parish Councils  of Scotland,  both of whichhave many duties with regard to the blind.   They  are according-liy of opinion that an Advisory Committee  should be set up inScotland who would advise the Secretary  for Scotland in  allmatters concerning the welfare of the blind.          It seems to me  that this h the proper  and usualarrangement in such a case as the present.  There is a ScottishLocal. Government Board, and a Scottish Education Department,and, as representing both these departments, I consider  thatthey are quite competent  to deal  with the proposals of theCommittee in Scotland on  the advice,  if  considered necessary,of an- Advisory Committee  set up for that  part  of the UnitedKingdom.          (SIGHED) ROBERT MUHRO .Scottish Office,  2nd November,  1917,
