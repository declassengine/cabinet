                    (This Document is  the Property ofSECRET.         His Britannic  Majesty *s Government.)               MINISTRY    OF    FOOD.Report for  Week ending  Wednesday, October 24,  1917.                        PART L-ACTION  TAKEN.                       CONTROL OF SUPPLIES AND PRICES.    Allied  Purchases. At a  meeting of the Meats  and Fats Executive  held onSaturday, the 20th October 1917, revised  estimates as  to civil and military require-ments were drawn  up  and  forwarded  to  Mr.  Owen  Smith  to  be submitted toMr. Hoover.    The War Office has agreed that purchases of pork and beans or other commoditieswhich are now being  purchased  through Mr. Owen Smith in America should also bemade by him on behalf of the army.                    -    The Ministry of Shipping  have instructed their representatives in New York toinform the Ministry of Food direct by cable as to  all shipments which are en route.    Mr. Hoover has cabled suggesting that pork and beans  should  not be put up asa ration  but shipped separately to the respective Fronts  and thus effect a saving intonnage  and an economy in tin plate.   The matter is  being considered  by the  WarOffice and the Ministry of Food.    Bacon. Hams, and Lard.-Consignments  of American bacon bought  on  Govern-ment account are now arriving at  Liverpool.   12,451  boxes  have arrived, of which3,481  have been allotted to Messrs.  Denny  for army requirements, the remainderbeing allotted to importers for distribution to the civilian population.    Estimates have  been prepared in conjunction with the liaison officer  of  the  WarOffice of army and civilian requirements up to 1919, and negotiations are proceedingwith America for the satisfaction of these requirements.    It is alleged that, in spite  of the increase in price, lard is still being withheld fromthe market.  Another return  of stocks is, therefore, being taken to  discover if theallegations  (if hoarding are correct and whether stocks  must be requisitioned.    The Maximum Prices Order and the  Scheme for Distribution of Imported Baconhave been further considered.   It is hoped to inform the trade of the Scheme duringnext week.    Butter. The negotiations for  the purchase of the entire  output of Australianbutter next season have  been  satisfactorily concluded, the price being 151*. per cwt.f.o.b.   The purchase of Argentine butter has been increased by 420 tons to  a total of7,b20 tons  at 170s. per cwt. f.o.b.    Dried  Fruits.- Advices from Greece recommend the postponement of purchasesuntil currant growers are more reasonable in their demands.    instructions have  been  given for  the  purchase of 5,000 tons of sultanas  inAmerica for shipment in the middle of November.  Inquiries are  being made  as  tothe prices of other dried fruits.    The Foreign Office report  that negotiations with the Spanish Ambassador arestill proceeding, and it is hoped that a quantity of raisins will be purchased in thenear future.    The Portuguese Government have agreed to remove the prohibition on the exportof figs in favour of quantities  purchased by  the Ministry, and inquiries  as to pricesare being made.    Date importers have been  given the? outside price which it is proposed to pay,and cables are awaited from Basra.    Feeding-sbujfs.-YuTtheT  negotiations have taken  place  with  the Oil   Seed Crushers with the object, of inducing them to form a pool for the purpose of averaging costs and sharing profits ; by  this .means it  is hoped to fix the pace of Oil Cake, basing it on the cost of production plus a reasonable proflc, rather than on the highest cost of production at the most uneconomically run mill.     Small committees have been set up  in. the  ports of London,  Liverpool, Bristol, and Hull,  for  the purpose of  acting as links  between the  Central Feeding-stuffs Advisory Committee in London and the Provincial Committees; they will also-collect returns of  stocks, and generally supply the &quot;Central Committee with local information.

    Fish. The Treasury have been, asked to sanction the purchase of 400,000 casesof Norwegian sardines.   It is anticipated that there will be a ready demand for thesein the Home markets.,    Inland Transport and Cold Storage. During the past week further negotiationshave taken place with the object of providing additional cold storage accommodation.    Cold Storage and Inland  Transport Officers have  already  taken up duty  atLiverpool, Manchester, Glasgow, Hull, Bristol, and Birmingham.   The representativefor Ireland will be appointed very shortly.    Arrangements  are being made for a steamer  to be  fitted  with  refrigeratingmachinery for  the  purpose/ of.  freezing fish, chiefly  herrings&apos; at  Stornoway.  Theproposal is to freeze fish, and thus preserve them, in  order that they may reach themarket in a good condition..               ^               -                   -    It  is also intended  that two carriers shall also be provided  with  refrigeratingmaterial for  conveying  the fish  from  Stornoway to  the various ports as may -bearranged.    Meat.-Mr. F. T. Boys,  London  Manager of the New  Zealand. RefrigeratingCo., Ltd.,  has  accepted  the post of  Director  of  Meat Supplies,   but the  necessary&apos;arrangements  with  his firm have not definitely been  settled:  . Mr. S. Young,  of. theBritish and Argentine Meat Co., Ltd.,  has resigned,  but  will continue  to act in anadvisory capacity. &apos;   -               .    A discussion has taken  place with the Board of Agriculture  as to the-proposedcensus of live stock/and it has been arranged that the form of returns, will be drawnup jointly by the -Board of ^Agriculture and the Ministry of Food ;  these forms will be&apos;distributed by the  police and the returns will be tabulated  by the Live Stock Com-missioners. - The Live. Stock Commissioner for Scotland has held meetings of theCentral Feeding.Stuffs- Committee for Scotland, and has appointed, after consultationwith the Scottish Board of  Agriculture, Feeding Stuffs and Live Stock Committees ineach of the six Food Control Areas of Scotland.           .                 . .    Mr.. Brad well, Chairman of the  Agricultural  Committee of- the  Auctioneers&apos;Institute, has .beenappointed to. represent the Institute on the Central AdvisoryCommittee on Live Stock and Meat, and  has undertaken  to enlist the support of allLi-ye Stock-(Auctioneers&apos;in ;t.he&apos; country for the control of live stock.  Mr. Colin  Camp-bell and.Mr: Nunneley,have been nominated by the National Farmers&apos; Union to serveon the same, committee. -   &quot; r  &apos;.    &apos;                -              ,   &apos;    As regards; Irish  cattle, efforts  are being made to increase the export of  cattlefrom  Ireland.; .this:had been held up by the divergence of two cross-channel boats bythe Ministry  of  Shipping for urgent use elsewhere; the  possibility of  using theArdrossan route;for, the cattle trade is being discussed: with the Board of Agriculture.    Schedules of-maximum wholesale prices of meat have been fixed for Birmingham,Plymouth and. Leeds, as  well as  London,            .    A  memorandum (M.G. Meat 4) has been  issued for the guidance of Local FoodControl Committees iin drawing up scales of maximum retail prices of meat;  modelscales are given for each of the different kinds of meat.   . Oils and&apos;Fats-Arrangements are proceeding satisfactorily  for increasing theoutput of margarine and the necessary refining plant.&apos;     Oil Seeds.-Negotiations  are. proceeding for the import of oil  seeds, and for thelimitation of profits  to a reasonable percentage.  For this it  is necessary to controlthe sale of all oil-seeds and oils  in the United Kingdom.  Efforts  are  being  made  toutilise existing trade channels, in order  that dislocation of trade and the maintenanceof a large staff may be avoided.    &apos;     Potatoes.-At the request of Mr. Parker, who is auswering questions in the Houseof Commons on behalf of Mr. Clynes, Major; Carr, the Assistant  Secretary in charge of the Fish, Fruit, arid  Vegetables  Division, attended  a  meeting of  Members:  of Parliament interested in the potato question for the purpose of explaining the Food Controller^ policy.- It was suggested  by one  or two members  that the guarantee given by the Government implied an undertaking to purchase on Government account all potatoes  that ivere unsaleable in the ordinary market  at rjl.   a ton.  The  chief grievance, however; appeared5 to; be that the Potatoes Order fixed a minimum price below which no farmer might sell.&apos; It was pointed &apos; out that the consumer could not fairly complain if he could get a practically unlimited supp]y of potatoes  at a price which fairly, represented the  cost of. production and; distribution.  61.  a .ton  to the grower  was  considered  by  the  three departments  of Agriculture to represent the
average cost of production in 1917, and -the Potatoes Order limited the profits of thedealer and the retailer so as to eliminate profiteering.                 .    Major Belcher,- of  the Navy and  Army Canteen Board, has  been  appointedDirector of Vegetable: Supplies.   -                                :.-    The question&apos;  of controlling the -price  of onions is  under consideration.. TheForeign Office have been asked to - purchase all Dutch onions, available for export, andto prohibit private  export trade.   Large consignments of brined: vegetables are beingimported from Holland, and arrangements are being made, to supply these to picklemanufacturers.     -                       &apos;       &apos;            &apos;   -             / :    Arrangements are  being made to supply, the Belgian Army in France with Irishpotatoes,  the  Belgian  Government - -Undertaking  to. provide the shipping. - : TheAmerican Army&apos;authorities have been asked whether they will purchase potatoes fromIreland  for their Expeditionary Force.; If they are willing to do  this,  a method ofpayment will be arranged which  will- serve as  a  set-off against British purchases to acorresponding amount in U.S.A.   / .&apos;     . :*  -     --    ;-   &apos;......- -    Sugar. On Saturday last a vessel bringing  6,000 tons of sugar from Mauritiuswas torpedoed off  the coast  of  North Africa,  and was supposed  to have been lost.Later information shows, however, that the vessel was not sunk, but has been beachednear Dacca; and there is some hope that the cargo may be salved.    The Sugar (Sales  for Ireland  Returns) ,Orcler,  1917, dated  October  20,  1917,requires all&apos;persons carrying . on-business&apos; in  Great  Britain as wholesale dealers insugar to make a return  specifying .any customers in Ireland to whom they supplysugar, together with particulars of the amounts bf sugar so supplied. *    Tea. The shortage of tea continues, and is acute in many districts.&apos;  &quot;    The arrivals of tea  during the week were  very small, only slightly exceeding3,500,000 pounds.    Endeavours are being ^made  to. equalize distribution  by dealing  with excessivestocks.                               LOCAL AUTHORITIES.  &apos;   . Food.Control Committees-There has been recently a  revival, of protests againstthe present composition of  the Local. Food Control Committees.  Representations arebeing received from Labour Organisations and Co-operative Societies, partly directedagainst  the presence of food traders on the Committees, but in many cases against theinadequate representation, or want  of  any  direct  representation,  of  Labour andCo-operative&quot; ^Organisations.   These protests&apos; are being dealt with  through the FoodCommissioners on  the lines&apos;laid down by Lord Rhondda.    The Committees have now&apos; been instructed that they may pay travelling expensesof their members and compensate them&apos;for loss of  remunerative  time  in attendingmeetings.                           ..... r    The Committees have been asked to advise whether the sale of bread containingfat: should be &apos; permitted &apos; in their  districts,, and whether special. prices should bepermitted locally.for bread, containing fat or ingredients in the nature of fat.    -    The preliminary, returns  of  applications - made: for. sugar cards under the SugarDistribution Scheme show that  the persons included-in the domestic  applicationsamount to about 90 per cent,  of the population in Great-Britain in.1915.   Informationfrom the  Food;Commissioners show . that&apos;, the  /scheme - is developing .smoothly up to    Food Economy. A circular  has  been issued to all Food Control  Committeesasking them  to  appoint  special  Committees  for  promoting, economy in food.   Thefinancial arrangements necessary to provide  those ^Committees with adequate fundswith which to carry on their propaganda have  now been  agreed&apos; with the Treasury,and a circular giving particulars of therri is being issued to the Committee shortly.     Transport. Arrangements have.been completed with  the Road and  MechanicalTransport Department of  the Ministry for  entrusting the  co-ordination of retailtransport of food to the Local Food;Committees, where,necessary..  A circular askingthe Food  Control Committees to take actionin this direction -has been prepared andis shortly being issued to the Committees.. ,   .     r;     -    .           &quot;              .I   -  PROSECUTIONS. r.   ;;    -/ -   - ,      :-      1.:  &apos;  At Biggleswade, on October 24, Joseph Hall, a market gardener,  of  Sandy, who was summoned&quot; on .37 counts for  selling potatoes  above&quot; the maximum  price at Sandy
between April and June, pleaded &quot; guilty &quot; and was fined 100Z. in eacli case (3,700Z.),ordered to pay 200Z. costs, and sentenced to two months&apos; imprisonment in the seconddivision in each case, the sentences to run concurrently.   Notice of appeal was given,but the Bench refused bail.  Hall was allowed seven days in which to pay the fines.    At Waisall  James Bain,  butcher, was fined 201.  for  selling meat at a priceexceeding that fixed by the local Food Control Committee, and at Huddersfield GeorgeHenry Howarth,  a wholesale greengrocer, was fined 82L 11s., and  George Broosbank,wholesale greengrocer, 121. 11s., for selling potatoes  above the prices fixed by theFood Controller.                                                            .......    A number of contraventions of the Butter (Maximum Prices) Order are reportedfrom various  parts of the country, especially from Ireland, and these cases are beinginvestigated.    It is reported from Battersea  that a large number of butchers have rejected thelocal schedule of prices, and the matter is  the subject of special investigation fromthe Ministry.   Several cases have come before the Courts, and  butchers have beenfined for not exhibiting lists of retail prices.    Before the Wallasey Bench, five Welsh farmers were fined in the  aggregate 101for charging excess prices for milk.    In Hampshire  two persons  were fined  301.  and. 5L  respectively for feedingpheasants with wheat.    At Ivybridge, in Devonshire, on the 22nd instant,  a farmer was  fined 10Z. forallowing two  ricks of corn to be spoilt by rats.  For  a  similar offence  in Cornwall,where  a farmer had failed  to thatch  his ricks and had  thereby allowed the corn to bedamaged by rain, a fine of 11. was imposed.              PART IL-SUMMARY  OF THE  FOOD POSITION.    There are two features of importance, neither of these of a favourable character,shown in the present weekly summary and tables.    1. Imports of the principal foods have fallen off, and stand at a very low figure.    2. In the paragraphs dealing with consumption the results of the returns receivedfrom bakers and retailers of flour for the four weeks immediately following the loweringof the price  of bread are set out.  Even, if  allowance be made for the low domesticstocks held on the eve of the change in those districts where baking at home is usual,the consumption in the period  has  risen 3 per cent,  as  compared with that in theprevious four weeks.  For  the  first time since May, the consumption  of  bread andflour is as great in 1917 as in the corresponding period of 1916.                   ..                                    IMPORTS.    The aggregate weight of the principal foods (including rice and tea) importedlast week  was 115,&apos;iOO tons (Table A).   In  last week&apos;s report it was pointed out thatimports had fallen very seriously ; this week there has been a further fall of 54,000tons, i.e., 32 per cent, on last week&apos;s total.    The great part  of this fall, however, is due to a small importation of  sugar(34,000 tons less than last week), following a series of several weeks&apos; high imports.    Only  64.000 tons of cereals (excluding  rice) were received, 18,500 tons less thanlast week, and far below average requirements.    After a  fair.importation of  tea in the week before last the amount fell again, andonly .1,496 tons, about 4 days&apos; supply, was received.    Butter increased 900 tons, but cheese diminished from 3,200 tons to 1,000 tons.    Meat increased from 5450 to 9,650 tons.  .                                  CONSUMPTION;    Meat. Increased supplies both  of home-fed and imported meat were received atfour principal meat markets (Table B) in the week ended October 13th; the aggregatewas 12 per cent, above the previous week, and.nearly 15 per cent, above the averagefor September, but still &apos;6\ per cent.  beloAV the corresponding week last year.    The supplies  of fat  stock  all showed a marked increase in  the&quot; week endingOctober 17th (Table. .0).  The numbers of cattle, sheep and pigs were respectively,.12, 6  and  3^ per cent, above the previous week, of  cattle and  sheep 21  per cent, and28 per cent, above, and of pigs 31 per cent, below the corresponding week last year.
    Bread and Flour-A preliminary: tabulation Has  been made of the bakers&apos; andretailers&apos;  returns  of  the use  and  sale of  flour for dhe four weeks beginningSeptember 17th, the date of the cheapening of the loaf.    The actual numbers are as follows : Date.	. Number of Sacks.			Flour used in making Bread, &amp;c. for sale.	Flour retailed.	Total.Four weeks ended October 14th, 1916 -,, September loth, 1917 October 13th, 1917 -	556,800 548,900 568,200	180,100 149,900 183,200	736,900 698,800 751,400    In the case of bread there is shown an increase of 3&quot; 5 per cent, over the previousfour weeks; last year there was practically no&apos; rise in the corresponding period.Whereas in the four weeks to September 15th the quantity was 1&apos;1 per cent, less thanlast year, in the most recent four weeks it was 2&apos; 1 per cent, greater than last year.    Flour, shows a much greater increase, viz., 22 per cent., when the four weeks toOctober 13th are compared with the previous four weeks, but only 1^ per cent, whenthey are compared with last year.   The great part of this  increase took place in thecounties of Northumberland, Durham, Yorkshire  and Lancashire, where home-bakingis customary, and is no doubt due to a  replenishment of home stocks,which-were at aminimum  on September 15th prior to the fall in price of flour.  It is not unlikely thatthe actual use of flour increased at the same rate as the use of bread.    If no  allowance is made for this  change  in the home stock of flour  the index-numbers are as shown in Table D, but a reasonable modification may be suggested asfollows: Date.	Index Numbers oE Consumption of Bread and Flour. May 1917 = 100.			1916.&quot; -	1917 (Unadjusted).	1917 (Adjusted).Four weeks to August 18th - -,, ; ,, September 15th ,, ,, October 13th - - -	95 941 95$	89^ 901	89^ 921 95^    On any reckoning consumption has increased both in September and October, andis now at least as great as last. year.   Moreover, the last four-weekly period, that isthe four weeks ending October 13th, is the first since May in which the consumptionin 1917 was not less than the consumption  in 1916.  It is  interesting to notice thatthe price of bread in 1916 was 9d. on September 1st and Q^d. on October 1st.                              WHOLESALE PRICES.    The Gazette average price of barley rose lOd. both in the week ended October 13thand in the week before.    English beef has risen week by week from 11.0s. three weeks ago to 114s., but isstill lower than a month ago ;  in the same period Argentine beef has risen 8s. Qd.    English mutton has risen Is. Qd. to the level of a fortnight ago.    Cottonseed cake has risen  from  310s. to 330s. and stands at the maximum pricereached in July.   Palm-kernel cake has risen 25s. and is also at the July level.A 4075-4B
