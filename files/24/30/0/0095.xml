It was pointed outthat the guns would he mounted with stops to preventtheir being fired et a lower elevation than 450.        The Committee decided that:-           These guns^ should be allotted.
  3.   The Committee considered a letter from theMinister of National Service to the Prime Minister,dated 23rd October, 1917 (G.T.2388) representing thepossibility sf over-lapping of functions of the Com-mitten on Man-Power and Recruiting and the War Priori-ties Committee.       The Minister of Munitions stated that hisDepartment had arranged to place.at the disposal ofSirAuckland Geddes the fullest possible informationregarding questions of Man-Power arising within thatDepartment-., -      The Comirdttee decided -      To recommend to the War Cabinet that the         Minister of National Service should become         a member of the War Priorities Committee.  4.   With reference to Minute 3 of the 3rd. Meetingthe Committee were informed that the following gentle-menhad been nominated to serve on the Lataour DilutionSub-committee -.    Mr.. Noel E. Peek of the Department of the jJeputy        Controller for Auxiliary Shipbuilding        nominated by the Pirst Lord.    Mr.. 3, Morgan of the Labour Supply Department of        the Ministry of Munitions,  nominated by the        Minister of Munitions.    The Committee decided -        That the  Minister of National Service should        also be asked to* nominate a member of this        Sub-Committee.  5.   The Minister-of Munitions stated that the.Admiralty had submitted a demand for 15,000 tons ofsteel to. make guns for the arming of merchant ships.This particular gun was designed to be manufactured ofalloy steel which was urgently required to meet the newaircraft programme..       Lord Cowdray said that he desired to emphasisethe fact thH the Air Board could not carry out theirprogramme if the  guns for merchant  ships were made withalloy steel, and  he pointed out that aeronauticalsupplies were being week by week held back for want
                       - 3 -     of such steel.     Mr. Churchill pointed out that in tho case of gunasupplied to the Army carbon steel had been substituted foralloy steel, and he, suggested thst the Admiralty shouldmake a similar concession.     Tho Committee docided that -     The question of the kind of steel to be used in      the construction of the above 1,000 guns should      be settled between the Ministry of Munitions      and the Admiralty represented hy the Admiralty      Controller.  6i   The Minister of Munitions stated that large quan-tities of alloy    steel were required arch month forarmour piercing shell.  The Admiralty demands, in fact,would require double tho amount of this kind of steel thatwas necessary for the output of aircraft.       The First Lord said that the question of armourpiercing projectiles was a most serious one;  they hadhot yet been cblo to produce an entirely satisfactorytypo for the Bavyf  At present alloy    stool wasabsolutely necessary for this kind of projectile, thoughthe Admiralty would welcome tho assistance of tho Ministryof Munitions in designing .v. substitute, if possible.       Tho Committee dooided that -       The Admiralty and the Ministry of Munitions        should go into the question of armour piercing        shell and tho possibility of producing a 3Ub-        stituto for ^lloy steely and thai in the mean-        time, tho Admiralty should scrutinize their        demands for alloy stool for armour piercing        sholl.       It was also agreed that the existing Allocation        Committee for steel should be utilized for the        allocation of all kinds of stool,  including        alloy steels.         :;  7,   The Minister of iuunitions drew the attention ofthe Committee ,to the very extensive demands that theAdmiralty wore making for T.U.T, which demands,  thoDepartment, he feared, would not bo :;..ble  to meet.       The First Lord said he understood  that the HighExplosive&apos;&apos;Department hud given assurances to the
Admiralty that it would &quot;be possible to meet all thedemands in question for T.F.T.        The Committee decided that        The matter should be further investigated        by the Ministry, of Munitions and the Admiralty        who should refer the result of their investi-        gation to the Permanent Sub-Committee.        The Cov. dttee further decided that *        The Permanent Sub-Con ittee should at once        examine the whole question of alloy    steel        and other steels and report to the Com dttee        at the earliest opportunity.8.      sir Arthur Duckham  rev/the attention of theCommittee to the fact that practically a deadlock hadbeen reached in regard to building; each Departmentwas expanding rapidly regardless of material and labouravailable, and,there was a danger that the country mighteventually be covered with unfinished buildings.        Sir Filliam Furse pointed, out that an adaitional20,000 hands were required for the construction of theprojected aerodromes-.  Unless this labour could beprovided and the construction accelerated,  aircraftengines, in accordance with the new programme,  would becompleted a considerable time before pilots and shedswere ready to man and accommodate them.        The Committee decided that -        In order to prevent the wasteful competition           and to secure proper, priority in regard to           labour and material for. the construction of           new buildingsj a Sub-Committee should be           formed to be called the Building Priority           Subcommittee, to consist of members who           should be Officials of high status,  of the           following Departments                   The Admiralty,                   The War Office,                   The Ministry of Munitions,                   The Ministry of National Service.           (the nominee of the Ministry of National            Service to be Chairman of the Committee)            to go into the question of the building pro-            gramme and to report as soon as possible to
      the Committee.      The Head3 of the Departments concerned undertook      to notify the Secretary the names of their      respective nominees.      The question whether the Office of Works should      be represented on the Committee was reserved for      further discussion.  9.  The Committee decided that an InterdepartmentalCommittee should be instituted to sit as required and todeal with the allocation of carbide and oxygen; in theevent of any difference, the point at issue tc be referredto the War Priorities Core: ii ttee.      The Minister of Munitions undertook to initiatethe necessary action to assemble this InterdepartmentalCo&quot;:-2.ii ttee.  10. With reference to Minute 5 of the 3rd.

It was further suggested that the return should -show the rate of wastage/in suns and shell,  the averageoutput for the last six months,  and the amount of railsand numbers of locomotives both manufactured and semi-manufactured.

The Committea decided -        To approve provisionally the skeleton form and           that the final-form should he determined in           accordance with an arbitrary formula definite-           ly laid down by. the Sub-Comivdttee and Sub-           mitted in DUO course to the Committee for           their Information and approval.
