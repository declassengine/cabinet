                 (This Pocmment is the[p^^rtyM 0        468                 Hl* Entannic Maje*ty&apos;* Government.)n ,1 o r  V                 &quot;                               tjF /           Compensation fey Sausage  done  by Air Raids.4c     1,   From my point of view the most important question arising in connection with the Treasury scheme la the date from which it is to take effect.   I am convinced, from the experi- enoe gained by Local Committees in oonnection with the relief of distress, that it will cause the greatest dieeatisfaotion if the scheme does not date from a period which at least em- braces the moonlight raids, and there will certainly be oom- plaints if it does not also cover the June and July raids.          The dates of the principal raids affecting the Metropolitan area are:-v                           1317     13th June, 7th July, 4th September, 34th September,     35th September, 39th September, 30th Septe&amp;ber, 1st     October, 19th October and 30th October.          The Prime Minister1s reply to the Deputation has  ,undoubtedly been legarded by the Local Committees and personsaffected as a pledge in regard to the September and Ootober raide, and it would be difficult to hold that when he met theDeputation on the 13th July he had not in mind the raids of 13th June and 7th July...          There would seem to be no need to go baok furtherthan the 13th June, but the raid of that date and the subse- quent raide should, it is suggested, be oovered.          There is probably no greater difficulty in asoertain-^ ing the facta in regard to the June, July and September raidstfcan in regard to the later raids.   The Police reoorde willshow the houses which were damaged in these raids, and in &amp;anycasea the Local Representative Committees have obtainedinventories of the furniture.          The Looal Representative Committees have beenauthorised to pay out of the National Relief Fund and othervoluntary funds for the replacement of essential artioles offurniture and clothing up to  20 in each case.   This authorityhas been liberally interpreted,  and therefore in a large pro-portion of the cases of small houses the damage will have alreadybeen made good by this means, and the coat to the Exchequer in respeot of the tenants- property should be slight.   It may bepresumed that the landlords will generally have been oovered byinsurance.     3*   The scheme contemplates that, in the oaee  of uninsuredproperty, notioe should be given to the Air Raid CompensationCommittee.   It is su^^seted that the Local RepresentativeCommittees ehould be given full  information aa to the eoheme,and that they ehould be instructed to advise and assist appli-oante in making out their claims.     3.   In the oaae of the East London Munitions Explosionan arrangement was made under which the Looal Relief Committeewere authorised, ponding assseament of the claims against theMinistry of Inanitions,  to make payments on acoount of any corn-pens at ion payable by the Minietty in respeot of loss  of ordamage to household effects.   Such payments were limited to asum not.exceeding  10,  or in special oases not exceeding  2k. in any individual case:  tne payee was required to give e
 receipt in a prescribed form: and the sums thus paid on account out of the grants given to the Local Committee from the National Relief Fund were subsequently recovered from the Ministry and repaid to the National Relief Fund.



Unless the compensation payable under the present scheme can be both assessed and paid within a few days after the Raid, it is suggested that a similar arrangement should be made in the present case. The experience gained in connection with the East London Explosion indicates that an arrangement of this kind would not only provide a prompt means of relieving immediate distress, but would also have a good effect in forestalling possible complaints of delay and in showing that the Government were in earnest.



4. The attached letter from the Town Clerk of Deptford shows the difficulty of working the "average" ? in the case of small householders. As, however, persons of this class will doubtless in future be uninsured this point loses its importance, but it must be assumed that a person at present insured by means of a Post Office Certificate will not be placed in a worse position by reason of the "average" ? than a person at present uninsured.

m^pvou^AS BOROUGH gg EffpygoRP.          Town Hall,              Now Cr oee Roa , 8 J5,3-41                  15th October, 1017.Sir,               BiBtreea jaxiglfig from Afr Raldg.          In connection with the work of the Local Committee forthe Prevention and He liet of -Distress in dealing with applioant.1who had their homes damagsd during the recent air raiaa, I have*found one or two instances in which certain .of t.heee; people, iuretreated with ***iat appeals to he ;undue&apos;harshneeOJ  of course theoases actually dealt with hy my Committee&quot;are only those who hadnot insured against air raids. but the treatment, to which Irefer hae been&apos; experienced hy those who had-insured.          To mention one instance;  a person insured her homesome two years ago for . 50; which was then t ie full value of thefurniture, /but einde that time a piano and other furniture hasbeen added to the home, and the assessor in questioning herafter the raid, elicited the fact that she valued her home atthe present t me at  100:  advantage was. iataedlately taken ofthie fact to reduce the claim by 50$ on the ground that thepolicy contained the average clause.          liy Committee quite understand that, as a commercialtransaction, the assessor was strictly within his rights in boaeting, hut I should be glad if some representation could bemade to the Government&apos;with a view to these small cases beingdealt with in a more aympathetio manner..          1 enclose herewith the blank form of policy which ifissued by the Poet Office, from which you will see t^iat althoughthe average clerse is included, it is in a very inconspicuousposition, and even.if the person effecting the insurancehappened to see it he would in many oases not appreciate it8aotual effect.          The feeling of my Comnittee is that these small oasesshould not be de?,It with in the same manner as a large insuranceolaim, and if any representation could be made to the Governmentto instruct theix ^sueesoio to exercise a little more o on aider4-tion in dealing with these unfortunate victims, the object ofthis letter will then have been achieved.                      &apos;:.&apos;)                    I am, Sir,                        Your obedient Servant,                            (Sgd) Arthur Purkis,                                iown Clerk and Honorary                                      Secretary. oretary,overnment Committee for the  Prevention and Relief of Distress,      Local Government Board,          Whitehall, S,V.l.
