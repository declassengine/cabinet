(Thig Pociifflaat in the ^ro^rty of  Colonel Jones12/^\ Hie Britannic Majesty-sBEG RETOPERATIONS *From:-  General Barter, Russia.To:C .1 .GWar Office.Handed in 11.57 p.m.October 28th 191*?*Received 8.20 a.m.October 31st 1917.1143 .Ifl ah interview to-day with Q.M.G. he told methat he had real hopes of doing something with Russian Armyand of having by January at least 400,000 picked men.  He  is(? receiving) large number of deputations and-applicationsfrom infantry units asking for some measures to be taken toprotect them and troops at front from Maximalist agitation *           They have also themselves suggested to him thedesirability of collecting all men willing to fight andforming them into separate armies.    Q.M.G. has already putinto action scheme for taking advantage of what appears tohim a promising change in morale.  Each Division on frontapproximately one hundred and seventy five in number hasbeen asked to form a company of volunteers who should allbelong if possible to definite area or Zemstvo.companies equal to these divisions has already been formed.The men individually bind themselves on oath to bar agita-tions of any kind and to occupy themsolves -with nothing butthe war.Scheme has so far progressed that number ofThe
           The Zemstvo and the volunteer company will be indirect touch with all Zemstvo and latter have undertaken toclothe and feed all recruits for their volunteers and alsoprotect them from political agitation.   In forming theseCadres guiding principle has been first voluntary enlistmentof men from other units and also right to choose their ownofficer themselves.   As soon.as first companies have beenformed and their liaison officers with their Zemstvo estab-lished they will then proceed to increase their establishmentto battalions and later to regiments maintaining territorialprinciples.           All Zemstvo in an Oblast (province) will unite toform provincial volunteer committee for the purpose of organ-is ing co-operation among Zemstvo in this work and also among                                               ftprovinces themselves.           Opposition in Petrograd to this scheme is expectedby the Q.M.G. but he thinks that it has now got too strong ahold to be stopped.
