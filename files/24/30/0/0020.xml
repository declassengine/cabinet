(This Document hi the Property ofHi-i Britannic Majesty&apos;a Government.)    SECRET          GERMAN OPERATIONS IN THE GULF OF RIGA.r, nf\  &quot;Admiralty Memorandum, for the  War.  Cabinet.       The main strategy of the Russian Fleet has been to actas the guard to the right flank of tfie Army: to effect this,.large minefields have heen laid, the ends of the fields beingcovered by batteries of 6&quot; to 12&quot; gunsr the Fleet lying securebehind these fields and having their aircraft to counter anymove  cn the-part of.the enemy to Sweep a passage.       The German plan was exceedingly simple and effective,Relying on the indiscipline.of the Russian  forces, they firstsweut a channel tc  Osel Island, and seized  Tagga Bay, (which Isnot defended by batteries) as a base: troops were landed andcolumns dispatched  to the East and South,   The Russian batteries                              tr on the South and East side of Osel., be ins constructed to fireseaward only, relied on the military forces.to defend the forts from attack in the rear*       As scon as the German troops were landed, minesweepers                                             ii cf the German Fleet swept a channel South of Osel:battleships bombarded the ill*-served batteries of &quot;guns at Sworbe and attacked Arensborg,  The combined effort was sufficient to cause the collapse of Russian resistance on this front,1Mean-while, the East-bound German troops successfully attacked Orissa, capturing the guns and  forcing their way to Moon Island; A portion of the German Fleet then swept the Moon Island Channel and engaged the retreating Russian Riga Gulf naval forces; The German Fleet thus secured the command of the waters up to,Dago Island.       The Russians have an advanced torpedo-boat destroyer and aircraft base at Hapsal, a submarine base at Eango, and/       to       179
Battleships  and  cruisers  at  Helsingfors.. .  Generally speakingthe discipline  in Russian torpedo-boat  destroyers is fair, butno reliance  can be placed on the  fighting  capacity of thebattleships  owing to the  entire  lack of discipline.       The Germans captured  Dago on the 22nd, thus uncoveringthe southern end of the main Russian minefield.  They now havea clear passage for their Fleet  into the Gulf of Finland as faras the second Russian minefield  laid to Northward of Reval andto Westward  of Helsingfors*   This is not a very extensive mine-field, unless it has recently been reinforced, as to which weare making enquiries.       There are many possibilities should this occur   (1) The Russian Fleet  can remain at  Helsingfors and cover-themselves with a new minefield  or re-inforce the present one,so as to prevent the Germans getting up to Reval,.  The securityof this latter place, however, depends  on the fighting capacityof the Russian Army, because, the Gulf of  Riga being in Germanhands, if the landing at ferder, about  70  miles from Reval, ispushed home, it would seriously threaten the Russian right flank-,and, if the Russian Army will not fight, Reval, which is strongseaward but  weak on the land side, must be at the mercy of theGerman land forces1 *, ...   (2) A German Landing, in Finland.  This, from the latestinformation^ does not appear to bo immediately contemplated,.but it is a contingency which must be reckoned with*  Asuccessful landing in Finland, assisted by Finns, wbuld resultin the Russian Fleet having to abandon Helsingfors and endangeringthe Archangel and Mniman railways, through Finnish action,       Generally speaking, therefore-, the  situation resolvesitself into this
       The  Russiars ftatfe lost their outpost bases except Hangoand Hapsal  and will be compelled either to give fight or remaiilbehind minefields  arid batteries either at Revtil or Helsingfors,Should the  former  place fall, a retirement to Cronstadt would beforced on them. They would then be situated in some formsimilar to the German Fleet in the Heligoland Bight, with thisdifference, that the German coast batteries are very good andwe do not hold an  advanced base on their coast\ whilst the RussianCoast batteries are very poor and the Germans will have animportant advance  base in Russian territory.       On the other hand, it is possible that the German mainoperations in this direction have ceased for the winter, and itis understood that they are relieving part of their land forces-,.leaving garrisons  only in. the Islands, and the more powerful shipsof their Fleet are being replaced by battleships and cruisers ofolder type, though the naval forces remaining will be numericallythe same as before.  Meanwhile the Germans are constructing abattery cn the western headland of Tagga Bayj the number and cali-bre of the guns in this battery is not yet known$ though they areknown to be naval  guns,.-AVAL STAFF,.    26th October.,  1917.
