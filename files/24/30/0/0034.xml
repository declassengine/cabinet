His Britannic Majesty^ Government.)(This PociwwtBt it the Property cf.SECRET.Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information.GSW/001.WEEKLY REPORT ON SWEDEN.  I.(October 27th,1917).The principal recent event in Sweden has &quot;been the fall of theSwartz-Lindmann Ministry and the formation of a coalition Liberaland Socialist Cabinet under Professor Eden, who occupies thechair of History at Upsala University.     The defeat of the Conservatives was heavy and they have lost16 seats.   The position of parties in the Second Chamber is nowas follows:- Conservatives 58,  Liberals 62, Social Democrats 86,Extreme Socialists i2, Farmers&apos;  Union and minor Agricultural parties     The election Was fought on the question of the extension ofthe Communal franchise;   but the main reason for the defeat of thelate Government was the  Commercial policy initiated by Mr Hammarsk-jold which by increasing prices at home fostered discontent at firstamong the industrial and later among the agricultural classes.Professor Eden had considerable difficulty in forming a Cabinet,as the Socialists considered that their number in the Chamberentitled them to more seats than have been allotted to them (fourout of eleven).  There was the danger at one moment that if ProfessorEden failed to form a Government a patched-up ministry of Royalnominees would have been constructed, probably with a pro-GermanMinister of Foreign Affairs.     By far the most important member of the new Cabinet isMr Branting, Minister of Finance.    It may be said that theElection is a victory for him.15.
       One interesting feature of the new Cabinet is the presence  of three new parties viz:   (1)  the Farmers1  Union (9 members),  (2)  the Agriculturists  (3 members),  and (3) the  Agriculturists National  Association (3  members).    These small bodies will tend to vote  with the Conservatives.    The Extreme Socialists lost three seats.  The Election has  shown that the old Socialist party has retained  its unity and the campaign of the Extreme Socialists against Mr.  Branting has been a complete failure and merely led to the faction  losing ground.  Professor Eden&apos;s  Statement of Programme.       This may be  summed up as follows:-  1.   The maintenance of an  unswerving neutrality fully impartial to  both belligerents with a corresponding commercial policy.  2.   Co-ooeration  between the three Scrndin: vi^n kingdoms.  3.   Wrrm L-ssooi-tion with  efforts towards establishment,  . fter the  war, of permanent pe^cc r.nd International judicial organisation  calculated to safeguard peace and render possible gradual  dis-  armament.  4.   Every effort  to be used to  solve the questions of food-supply  end industrial  production.  5.   Extension of  the Commercial franchise and political suffrage  to  &quot;-omen.  Argentine Cables  Scanfc.1.       The disclosures b^ the U.S.A.government of tho unncutral  A-ction of the Stockholm Foreign Office filled tht.- m jority of Sv-dcs  with disgust.  At  the s-me time it is unfortunrte th t a,  section  of the British  press should h- ve visited the cino of the Ministerr of Poreirn Aff r irs  on the-  whole n tion.   The normal Svede is
 intensely  sensitive to adverse  criticism of his country and such headlines  as  &quot;Swedish Spies&quot;  etc.  have  partly undone the good which might have been expected  to accrue- to  the Entente cause from the disclosures.  Still there is  ho doubt  that the revelations made a deep impression in Sweden.    Another  aspect of the violent condemna- tion of Sweden is that it greatly  increases the difficulties of such men as Branting who  are  warm  friends- of the Entente.   No European is more susceptible  to flattery than the Swede, and had our Press recognised this more fully perhaps mere value might have been extracted  from the incident. General State of Feeling  in Sweden.     This  may be said to  be in  a condition of suspense.  A con- siderable  section of the  population is  convinced that it will be difficult  if  not impossible for Sweden to keep out of the *. ar.  The nation may be said to be  clinging  tc  neutrality much as a drowning man clings to a life-raft.    On the other hand competent observers seem on the whole tc be confident  that  only a deliberate act of aggression on the part of Germany  would force Sweden to take up arms. The new Government is at  all  events a  guarantee that during their tenure of  office there will be  no  probability of Sweden joining the Central Powers.   Apart from  the upper  classes and the Bureaucracy in Stockholm  the feeling  of resentment  against Germany is widespread. In some districts such as Norrland the  population is described as being solid against Germany.  The  reasons for this changed sentiment are thus explained.  Among the  business men in Norrland it rests on a wholly selfish basis.  They simply feel that they can get nothing more cut of Germany and must in future  hope  to make money elsewhere.   On$the other  hand, the mass  of the people  considers that Germany, with the help of the Swedish upper class, has  taken the bread out of  their souths.  The  constant sinking by the German submarines of Swedish
 merchant ships and the general conduct of the war by the German Government have convinced large sections of the Swedish people that official Germany is little better than a gang of pirates. In spite of a most active propaganda, on which enormous sums are spent, it is probable that Germany is losing ground in Sweden and that the anti-German feeling of the masses is working upwards.



Destruction of the neutral merchant ships on October 17 in the North Sea.



The loss of Swedish vessels and seamen owing to the barbarous action of the Germans has caused much indignation. Even Conservative ?-German newspapers like the "Stockholm Dagblad" speak in no measured terms and state that the guns were turned even on the life-boats. In the "Dagens Nyheter" Captain Dehlgren describes the incident as a most disgraceful stain upon the honour of the German fleet.



Official announcement on Oct. 23rd that Sweden is negotiating with Germany for the import of wheat and potatoes.

It seems doubtful whether these negotiations will lead to anything which can modify the food position in Sweden. It is perhaps a move to assist the German propaganda, and it is also possible that Germany in order to further her military aims in Sweden in connection with Finland, might actually export corn and potatoes at the risk of starving her own people.

These foodstuffs would, of course, be in compensation for iron-ore.
