     The SUgar Commission has purchased in Holland onehalf of the exportable surplus of Dutch sugar on theterms of the Dutch Sugar Refiners, that is to say cashtermsr   Vfcen this arrangement was made (in May 1917)the Treasury gave their sanction to the purchase on theabove termsc     20,000 tons of sugar have been tendered by theDutch, hut up to the present only 2,000 tons have been.accepted;  and the Treasury refuse to pay for any ofthe balance stating that they are unable to find theexchanger   The Treasury have however authorised theForeign Office to negotiate a credit of  500,000 forsix months or if possible for twelve months, to coverthe necessary purchaser   Sir Wr Townley has been in**structed to endeavour to arrange this, hut it is un-certain whether it can he doner     If the above loan is not secured the Treasury,  itappears,  intend to repudiate the contract entered intoby the Sugar Cornmissionr   The result of such repudia-tion would he that the sugar would be free to go toGermany/..     We are importing large quantities of sugar fromJava (payment in Holland)c   The Treasury are under-stood to  have sanctioned credits for  3,000,-000 forthis purpose, and the expenditure on sugar purchased inHolland was to-he deducted from this amount/ &apos;  The                                             Shipping
 Shipping Controller is most anxious that as much sugar as possible should come from Holland instead of from Java on account of the obvious saving of tonnagee     The Food Controller is most anxious to buy cheese in Holland, especially the quality richest in cream. By purchasing this cheese f rOrb, Rotterdam, we should save the bonus of  19r per ton which  (under ouo5 Agricultural Agreement with the Dutch) is &quot;payable on cheese sold in this country through the ordinary channels, besides saving the shipping required to bring cheese from America,     There is plenty of space in the ships trading from Holland to the United Kingdomr     Repeated and urgent applications have been made to the Treasury by the Foreign Office and by the Food Controller, but the Treasury decline to sanction the purchase of this cheesef     Meanwhile the Treasury have recommended to the Foreign Office that,  in view of the adverse position of the Dutch exchange, the Agricultural Agreement with the Dutch should be denounced forthwithr     Such a step would undoubtedly entail a large in- crease in the exports of Dutch produce to our enemy. In the second place any purchases which might still be made by us would have to be made at the German priee;  and, moreover, there would be (if the Agree-ment were denounced)  difficulties in the way of secur- ing any exports from  Holland to this country at all.Since the above was written I have seen the                                        Food
Food Controller^ Department and they will see theTreasury again regarding cheeser   It appears that IvlrrBonar Law has written to Lord Rhondda saying that ifarrangements are made to take this cheese as part ofour proportion under the Dutch Agricultural Agreement,the purchase may be mader    The R*E*.SrDc and FoodController are now in communication with the Treasuryc                     NORWAYr     le have received instructions from the Treasuryto denounce the Fish Agreement on Saturday to take \ef-fect on the 30thr Novemberc     At a meeting this afternoon it was decided to askthe Treasury to allow us to continue the purchase offish oils which can probably he sold in Norway to DeNo Fa at about cost price and so replace Krbners forthose used for purchase - by this means we keep controlover oils..     We are also asking for permission to purchasecod roes (a very small matter of about  20,000 a year)which we sell to the French Sardine Fishermenr     And we are pointing out that if arrangements can bemade, the Food Controller is most anxious to importfresh herringsr     The years cost for this is estimated at about 1,500,000,     Of course if arrangements cannot be made with theNorwegian Government to restrict exports of fish toGermany and if the Treasury decline to allow this  pur-                                                chase
purchase of ,fresh herrings the whole of the herringcatch may go  to Germany i,e,  about 300,.000 tons a yearin addition to the cod and other salted fish.     Mr,  Volkmaar has been invited to come here todiscuss Scandinavian Exchange,  QUESTION cw emMMmL M&amp; QE HfiMIM PANNED FISH,     Our efforts to control the Norwegian canned fishindustry by withholding supplies of tinplatee and otherraw materials from canners working for the enemy havebeen only partially successful owing to the successfuluse of substitutes by &quot;Black&quot; canners.-   The industryis now divided into two camps consisting of the saidBlack Canners and the White Canners or members of theUnions which have entered into agreements with HisMajesty&apos;s Government,   The former exported some 20,000tons of fish last year, and these supplies have been ofgreat value to the enemy for military and other use,     While the Black Canners have flourished, theWhite have of late been faced with difficulties owingto the acute shortage of tinplates in the United King-dom whence they formerly imported them.   Their businessis threatened with complete stoppage on this account.The shortage here is so acute that there is no hope ofresuming the export of plates, as such export would onlyoe justified if the product were supplied for the use ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government,   It has proved impossible  to                                              arrange
arrange this, as the Army Contracts Department could notoffer prices sufficiently attractive to the earnersf   Itis doubtful&apos;whether, even when the American embargo isremoved, the United States will any more than we be ableto spare tinplates to enable the Canners tc carry onordinary businessr   Their prospects are therefore bad,and they will have an enormous temptation to abandon theUnions and go into the Black businessr     The White Canners,  cut off from the enemy marketand unable to.get their price from His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, have this season been piling up stocks which nowamount to 400,000 cases ire, 40 million boxes worth some-thing like  1,200,000 to  1,500,000,   All this is sub-ject to our restrictions, and is not very likely to go tothe enemy whatever happens, but, if the canners breakloose, the existence of so large a stock cannot fail tobe to some extent a dangerr   This danger would bs re-moved, and the situation of the canners would be tempor-arily relieved,. if a safe and good market could be pro-videdr   If the Canners realised their stock at a goodprice they would have money in hand and the temptationto throw over His Majesty&apos;s Government and go into theBlack trade would be diminishedr     In these circumstances the Food Controller was askedto look into the possibility of buying the stock forcivilian consumption in  this countryr    He did so andwas so impressed b^ the  advantages from, the suppliespoint of view that he decided to negotiate for the pur-chase of the whole stock subject to Treasury sanction,ft). Is has just been refused,  and an arrangement which                                                 would
would have simultaneously served the interests of theMinistry of Pood and the Ministry of Blockade has thusbecome impossible,   The arguments in favour of securinga stock of good keeping food of a popular kind from anear source are obviously strong.   The advantages tothe blockade have been described above.   They wouldhave been the better secured as it would have been pos^sible to make it a condition of the purchase that thesellers should give assurances in regard to their futuretrade.   The Ministry of Shipping would also have gain-ed, as the goods could be shipped to the United Kingdomin ships for which ballast- now has to be.bought in Nor-way.     Failing the purchase of the fish for this country,we are forced to place our hopes on the sale of the fishin Norway, where there is a question of its being boughtup by the local Provisioning Committees*Foreign Office,     November 1st, 1917,
