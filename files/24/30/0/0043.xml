     Sir, 

            I enclose herewith a Resolution road to me in my office by the Lord Mayor of Cork in the presence of the other signatories, except Sir Stanley Harrington. I asked Captain Pringle of my Staff to be present.



2.- After the roading of this document I asked the questions herewith attached, and received the answers written near them. I then informed the Lord Mayor that under the conditions I was unable to remove the restrictions that Officers below the rank (or relative rank) of Lieutenant Commander, and men were forbidden to visit Cork or its suburbs.

3.- I told the Lord Mayor that the last paragraph of the Resolution would be brought to the notice of the U.S.A. Ambassador in London in order that he might carry out the last part of the paragraph in such a way as he considered fit.

4.- I was asked by the Lord Mayor whether the men might be allowed to visit Cork during daylight hours; but replied that I could not consider such a proposition in which it would appear that the men were free to spend their money by day and then required to leave the town before dark.

5.- I have sent a copy of this letter and its enclosures to the British Admiralty and to Captain Peinsett Pringle of the "MELVILLE" for the personal information of the Officers in command.



                                                      I have the honour to be,
