                      Wart  Disease  of Potatoes.          The  indoor staff have  been busily engaged as before withnew cases,  as  well as entering up  in theirvappropriate registersthe substance   of the reports received from the Inspectors asregards existing cases of Wart Disease.          During the last fortnight  493 new cases were registered,bringing up the total record to  17,679 cases.    The last caseregistered before the beginning  of the present planting season wasnumbered 13,764.   These  figures show the great increase of workunder the Wart Disease Order.          17 new infected areas  were notified  during the lastfortnight,  &apos;.7hich brings up the total number to 493 infected areas,and there are  other reports  which  are being dealt with.          The  outdoor staff  was  fully occupied in the work ofinspection and of propaganda against the spread of the disease.In this latter connection there  have been successful prosecutionsagainst occupiers for contravention  of the Wart Disease Orders -which have their educational advantages.                            Ordnance Survey.          75,007 maps were sent  to France during the week and 20,074to the Admiralty.          6 relief models v/ere sent  to France.          A draft of Royal Engineers for the Field  Survey Companieswas sent to France.                            Fisheries Division.          The  Board have  made Orders which have the effeot ofauthorising trawling by motor boats  in Cardigan Bay and in part ofStart  Bay as  from the 1st November.          This is the first  exercise of the power conferred upon theBoard by the Food Controllers  Order empowering this  Department tooverride restrictive regulations affecting fishing operations.          The  effect upon the fishing interests in the Rivers Wyeand Severn of  the proposed Government shipbuilding works at Beachleyis under consideration.    The Board  are in communication with theAdmiralty regarding the best site  for the sewer outfall and theprovision of cottage accommodation for the local fishermen displacedby the new works.          The  Division also  dealt  with important  questions ofaffecting the  raising of  Powick  (Worcester) and  Chester Weirs in theinterest of conserving coal  supplies;.  the closure  of fishing areasin the English Channel for Naval purposes;  insurance against Warrisks of Belgian and Dutch boats fishing from  an  English port;  anOrder made by  the London  Port Sanitary Authority  requiring shell fishtaken from beds near Southend to be  relaid in  pure water previous tosale for human consumption;   the supply of creosote and tar for thepurpose of treating fishing gear,  and grants from the DevelopmentFund for harbour and fishery research purposes.2.
                           Fishing Permits.          41 permits  to  fishing vessels have  been issued during the          notices have been issued to  the  fishermen between the Nazeand the North Foreland acquainting them with  the  regulations for thesprat  fishing, with various amendments of the general fishing and7/ild fowling Regulations.              Fishermen^ Registration &amp;  Recruiting Section.Fishermen  and Naval Service,          The Admiralty, who have throughout  sympathetically regardedthe desire of the Board  to  secure a continuance  of the fisheries ineffective  operation,  have arranged to  replace many of the men calledup by  drafts of  seamen from sections of the Navy  other than theminesweepers and auxiliary patrols.    As  a result of this, and of thetemporary  use of Canadian seamen, the  Board have  been enabled tonotify the great majority of the men at present warned for call thattheir  services will not  be  required before the end of the year.          The claims  of  the trawler owners of Grimsby for particularconsideration for the skippers of their fishing vessels, on theground of  the impossibility of suitably replacing men from thisrating v/ho were  called for  service, is under  investigation,information having been  received from  various sources to the effectthat the services of  skippers overmilitury  age willing to go to seaare  obtainable.Fishermen,  Fish  Trade and Military Service.          The Board understand that the release  from the Army of suchmen as were named in  their  requests for furlough  in connection -?riththe East Coast herring fishery has now been agreed, except in thecase of men in category  &quot;A&quot;,men overseas,  and certain others inhospital or otherwise unavailable.          The Board have arranged with the Ministry of NationalService a  routine treatment for isolated  applications for temporaryrelease from the Army of men for the fishing  trade.          Representatives of the Board appeared before the CentralTribunal in connection with the case of a  fish merchant of Grimshy,and urged  that no further reduction should be made in the personnelof the industry  at that  port until the Board  had  conducted a censusof the shore workers.   The Tribunal urged upon the Board the needof co-operation  and were informed that pending the result of thiscensus the Board could not express an  opinion as  to whether thedepletion  of the staffs  had already proceeded beyond the stage at&quot;tfhich  co-operation could be carried out without a loss of efficiency.The census is being carried out.                            Fish Food Committee.          Owing  to constant reports of illness due to eating shell-fish the Local Government Board will probably cause several beds tobe closed.  A preliminary  conference  has  been held with thatDepartment.          For the present,  action is probable at  Lympstone, Teignmouth,and Glasson Dock.   The  Board  and the  Committee are continuing theirinvestigations with a view  to  purification of the  mussels.
sogood for  curing Red Herrings.          The tops of timber trees and other  similar wood is used for this purpose.   Supplies are very  scarce  owing  to the use  of the -.7ood by  camps as firewood.   The Committee are  in communication v?ith the Controller of Timber Supplies.          The Sorat Fishing is being carefully watched both in the Thames Estuary and on the North-west Coast, with a  view to avoiding tfaste, and preserving as much as possible by  canning and otherwise. The season has now begun and promises to be heavy.good Turnings.          T&amp;e demand continues to grow, and 2,000 further sacks have been ordered through the Army Contracts Department.Preservation  of Fish in Sulphur Dioxide.          Experiments are being made with a quantity of herrings and whiting, which have been for a fortnight in bottles in S.0.2.   It appears  so far that success is improbable.Refrigeration of  Fish.          Experiments will it is hoped shortly be made on behalf ofthis Committee by Professor Gardiner and others at the CambridgeUniversity Laboratories,                        Motor Loan Committee,          During the past week the activities of the Committee havebeen absorbed chiefly in overcoming difficulties of railway transportand supply of engines and installation materials,   One moreinstallation has been completed satisfactorily.          Owing to the large gathering of boats at Yarmouth andLowestoft to take part in the peculiarly successful herring fisherythis season, the supply of paraffin has run short at these ports.Efforts are being made to hurry further supplies to these points,but it is likely that as many as 100 boats may be laid up to-day(31st Oct.) at Yarmouth and 20 at Lowestoft for want of fuel.          Recently a 50 ft. motor boat got on board about 110 cransof herring, abandoning 25 nets with 75 or 80 crans in them.   Themass of fish burst the bulkhead, buried the motor, and filled thecabin.   The boat was towed in by a patrol boat.                     Freshwater Fish Section.          Enquiries have been addressed to all Boards of  FisheryConservators regarding cases of pollution of rivers in theirdistricts, the causes of such pollution and the action, if any,taken in the matter.
