dolonel Jones492PrmfeS for the War Cabinet.  November 1917.SECRET.     f          NAVAL  WEEKLY  APPRECIATION-No. 23.f V*&quot;&quot;                     Fee&amp; ewdetf 28th October.      /                         _     /                            NAVAL  OPERATIONS.    On October 9th and 10th the British Submarine &quot; E.1 &quot; endeavoured to attack ships Baltic.in Libau harbour, but was prevented by the large number  of T.B.&apos;s spread  across thechannel.    On October 15th the British Submarine &quot; E.9 &quot; unsuccessfully attacked a convoy of &apos;5small ships and 2 destroyers.    On October 16th, at 5.30 a.m., in  the Gulf of Riga, the British Submarine &quot; C.27 &quot;sighted the main German Fleet in three lines with transports and a destroyer screen.  Sheattacked the first Dreadnought at 300 yards with two torpedoes which passed underneath,one exploding shortly afterwards but it is not known what was hit.  &quot; C.27 &quot; then firedat the last transport, hitting her amidships.  Fire was opened on the  submarine,  andshe  was attacked with depth charges.  On the 17th &quot; C.27 &quot; dived through Irben Straitsby daylight and seeing the torpedoed transport with four trawlers  alongside gave chasebut could not reach her.    The Germans are now in complete possession of the Islands of Osel, Dago and Moon,and a force has been landed on the Werder Peninsular on the mainland.    Details of the German Fleet are reported to be at Kuivast  (Moon Island).   TaggaBay and Arensburg, in Osel, continue to  be used as bases.   On October 25th and 26th aportion of the fleet  made a demonstration against the Livonian coast, but no troops werelanded, and the ships retired after bombardment.   The Russian Fleet is now in the Gulfof Finland ;  battleships are at Helsingfors; cruisers at Revel,  Helsingfors, Lapvik  andAbo ;  and destroyers and  submarines at the same bases, with a few in the advanced basesof Hapsal and Hango, on either side of the entrance to the Gulf.    The Russian minefield, extending between Nargen Island, off Revel, and Makiluoto,a rocky island on the Finnish coast, is stated to be intact and efficient.    The Monitor &quot;  Marshal Soult &quot; bombarded Ostend on October 21st, and photographs Manderstaken from aircraft show that satisfactory results were obtained.                        and Dover    Three German destroyers, accompanied by 17 bombing  aeroplanes, were engaged on area&quot;October 27th by the flotilla leader  &quot; Botha &quot; and 3 British and 2 French destroyers, at arange  of 6,000 yards.  Two direct hits were  observed on the enemy destroyers who thenwithdrew under their  batteries.  The aeroplanes  attacked  in V formation at 3,000 to4,000 feet, each machine dropping 3 bombs, but they made no hits and their  formationwas broken up by the fire from our anti-aircraft  guns.  The Allied casualties were sixmen wounded, one  severely.    The destroyer  &quot; Marmion &quot; has been sunk by collision at night in the North Sea. Casualties,Two officers and 17 men were picked up.    The Submarine &quot; C.32 &quot; went  aground in Kyno Sound (N.E. of Gulf of Riga), and asattempts to float her failed, she was destroyed to prevent her falling into the hands of theenemy.  The crew were landed safely.    The light cruiser &quot; Centaur &quot; was mined in the North Sea but reached Port safely. &apos;    A large seaplane has been lost in the North Sea owing to engine failure, the crew beingrescued by a Dutch torpedo boat.    R.N.A.S. bombing squadrons from Dunkirk  have  carried  out raids  on enemy R.N.A.S.aerodromes at Vlessighem, Houttave, Varssenaere, Sparappelhoek, and Engel,  on Bruges OperationsDocks and Zeebrugge Mole, and on railway junctions at Melle, Thourout, Lichtervelde, in Flanders.

Mediter-ranean.and Cortemarck.   At Zeebrugge two small vessels or barges alongside the Mole were hit,and bombs burst close to seaplane base and other buildings on the Mole.  At Melle bombswere observed to burst.on the railway.  At Thourout bombs fell&apos; close to a moving train,which stopped, a large explosion being caused.   At Lichtervelde direct hits caused a heavyexplosion followed by numerous smaller ones.    The total weight of bombs dropped was over 12 tons.    In  aerial fighting R.N.A.S. machines from Dunkirk have destroyed  three  enemymachines and driven down six completely out of control.   One of our machines is missing.    On October 26th a large enemy  submarine was bombed near Oran by two Frenchseaplanes, and a French patrol boat has engaged an enemy submarine, also in Moroccanwaters.                              ATTACK  UPON  ENEMY SUBMARINES.Submarines     During the week under review 11 to 18 large enemy submarines have been out, ofoperating,  which 9 to 12 have been operating in the Atlantic and one in the vicinity of the White Sea.              The greatest activity has been experienced off the East Coast, in the English Channel          and  in the Mediterranean, but owing to  bad weather few  reports have  been received          from &quot;the  westward of the British Isles.  The &quot; Submarine  Cruiser &quot; referred to in last          week&apos;s Appreciation has now been out 55 days and was last heard of on the 28th October          when she was 18 miles west of Dakar.Actions        The following Table shows the number of actions with enemy submarines in Homewith enemy Waters during  recent weeks, the  nature of the craft which have  engaged them, andsubmarines. ajs0 ^he number of submarines destroyed by mine : Nature of Craft, &amp;c.SubmarinesSpecial Service ShipsT.B.D. and T.B. ...A.P.

The number and tonnage of British Vessels lost this week show a great reduction onthe figures of the previous week  and are comparable  to the figures for  the three recordweeks in  September,  the tonnage  of British  Vessels lost in the week under  review beingonly just over 200 tons in excess of the record week  (ended September 29th) since thecommencement  of unrestricted  submarine warfare. The figures of Allied  and NeutralVessels which have up to the present been reported as sunk this week are the lowest on record;but last week&apos;s figures of Allied and  Neutral Vessels lost have been considerably increasedby the loss of 8 further vessels reported after the issue of last week&apos;s Appreciation.    The total tonnage, British, Allied and  Neutral,  sunk this week  is 54,180 tons, asagainst 151,289 tons sunk in the week ended  October 20th.    The table in Appendix I shows  in detail the numbers  and tonnage of sailings  and oflosses by  submarine and mine, and the percentage  of losses to sailings of British MerchantSteamships of over 500 tons gross register, and the table in Appendix II  shows by tradesas regards such ships the percentage of tonnage sunk by submarine and mine to tonnagesailing to and from United Kingdom ports during the last three weeks.  It will be seen thatthese percentages show a great improvement on the previous week, being, both as regardstotal oversea traffic to and from United Kingdom  ports and the total of all traffic  to andfrom United Kingdom ports, almost exactly  one-half of last week&apos;s percentages.   This isaccounted for not only by the reduced number of vessels  sunk but by a considerable increasein the total tonnage at sea.  There were no losses in the American Trades.    The table in Appendix III is a comparative statement of all British Merchant Vessels  Areas insunk, damaged or molested, and of all Allied and Neutral Merchant Vessels sunk in the last  whlch]two weeks by enemy  craft and by mine according to areas.  From this  it appears that  VeSSe Senemy submarine activity has declined in practically all areas excepting in the  Arctic andWhite Sea, where losses are reported for the first time for several weeks.Losses ofBritishsteamshipsin trades.                                ENEMY MINES.        &apos;   V    The chief minelaying  activity of the enemy this  week has taken place in the war  Minelaying!channel between Tees and  Scarborough, off the South-East Coast of England, and in theSouthern entrance of, the Sound of Islay.  Drifting mines observed in certain areas  havegiven rise to the suspicion that new minefields have been laid, but as these suspicions  havenot so far been verified, it is probable that the mines have broken adrift from known areasduring  the recent heavy gales.   Steps have, however, been  taken for the  safeguardingof  ships in suspected areas and,&apos; amongst others, alternative channels were brought intouse both for the Mersey and the Clyde.

DEFENCE AGAINST SUBMARINE  AND MINE.    During the week 651 ships have been convoyed as compared with 798 last week.  Ofthe 651 ships convoyed, 351 were engaged in the French Coal Trade and 94 in the Scandi-navia-Lerwick Humber route, the remaining 206 being  engaged, on  overseas trade, 138inward and 68 outward.  There have been seven losses in convoy, four on the Scandinavia Lerwick Humber route, one in an outward convoy from Lamlash, and two vessels in thethrough route from Liverpool to Port Said.    In addition one vessel in the Milford to Gibraltar convoy was torpedoed and sunk inthe week ending 21st October, but has only been notified this week.    During the week 45 additional Merchant Vessels  have been fitted to take DefensiveArmament, the number at present fitted being  3,378. 1    The ,number of guns now available amounts to  3,069.Offensive       The number of howitzers and bomb throwers delivered during the week is 36, thearmament,  total delivered to date being 181.Mine pro-       During the week 50 additional Merchant Ships have been fitted with Otter equipment,tectiongear. bringing the  total number so fitted up to  647.

Four of          these vessels  have been sunk, three by enemy action and one in collision.MOVEMENTS  OF  ENEMY  VESSELS.Merchant-men.Raider.    Four enemy Merchant  Ships have this week arrived at Norwegian ports (outsidethe Cattegat), and four have left.  None have arrived at or left Rotterdam.    On the 6th of October a large launch arrived on the north-east coast of Queenslandnear Pascoe  River.  A  number of men, white and coloured, who  spoke English badly,were on board, and also guns and ammunition in boxes.   A party landed  (one of thenumber being armed  with a rifle with bayonet fixed), and enquired as to the situationof the telegraph line and  whether  it was guarded.   The launch left early the  nextmorning.    It seems probable that this launch was manned by part of the crew of the raiderS.S. &quot; Wolf,&quot; which was last reported to be  south-east of New Guinea on August 12th.                      FOREIGN  NAVAL INTELLIGENCE.                                     ITALY.    Preparations have  been made  to  evacuate  Grado,  and the two  British monitorsstationed there have left for Venice.  Grado is situated  about 12 nautical miles south-west of Hermada, and has been used as a base for the monitors and other craft assistingin the operations of the right wing  of the Italian Army.
                                     FRANCE.    The French Chamber has just passed  a  modification of the Military Code du Justicewhich provides for seamen and soldiers sitting on Courts Martial with their officers.   .                          UNITED STATES  OF AJUERICA.    The British  Commander-in-Chief, China,  has  accepted the offer  of his  Americancolleague (Admiral Knight) to  assume responsibility  for the trade routes between  TorresStrait and Banka Straits, from the North of Australia westward almost to Singapore.  TheTJ.S. force locally available consists of three cruisers and three gunboats.                                     BRAZIL.    On Saturday, October 27th, Brazil declared a state of war to exist with Germany, andattempted to seize the German gunboat &quot; Eber &quot; which has been interned at Bahia sinceSeptember, 1914.  The crew, however, sank the vessel at her moorings.^ BraziTs actionwill have a certain moral  effect on other South American States, and incidently gives hera legal title to the requisitioned German ships which were otherwise liable to arrest inneutral ports.  It also entitles her to more considerate treatment by the Allies for whichshe has little to give in return.   Two battleships, two light cruisers, ten destroyers, andthree submarines of  her squadron are modern units, but all except five of  the destroyersneed repairs.  The personnel is quite inefficient for modern  operations,  and only purelylocal assistance can  be expected from her Navy.  -NAVAL STAFF,    1st November, 1917.[APPENDICES,
