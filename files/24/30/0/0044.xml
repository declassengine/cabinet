280MILITARY  LABOUR ,..^SfR&amp;8.&quot;   kkh      MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF NATIONAL SERVICE     In accordance with the directions of the War Cabinet(No.252 Minute 10 (c)) I now bring forward for considera-tion the question of Military Labour.  .     This Labour may be divided into two classes:     (a)  Military Labour engaged on military                            undertakings.     (b)  Military Labour engaged on civil                            undertakings.    To the first of these no reasonable objection can boraised.  There appears to me to be no difference in sub-stance between the construction of an aerodrome inEngland and the construction of an aerodrome in France.     It is important, however, that military and civilianlabour should not be mixed, and that military units orindividual soldiors should not be put at the disposal ofcivilian contractors constructing military works, to beemployed side by side with civilian labour.     The employment of military labour on civil undertak-ings stands on an entirely different footing.  It appearsto me to be open to grave objections.     Owing to the exigencies of the military situation,however, I think that this labour must in practice bedivided into two categories.  It is necessary to maintaina considerable force for home defence.  A  large part ofthis force is trained in military duties,  and is keptmobilised ready to repel an invasion.  It  is therefore
primarily a fighting force; secondarily.; however, it is apotential reserve of labour.  The man power of the countryhas been so drained that it would be economically unsoundto refuse to use it, when civilian labour is not available,and it can be spared from military duty.     There remains the category of military labour,- and itIs a large one,- which cannot by any reasonable probabilitybe required for military duty, but which has been retainedin uniform and under military discipline, thsagh engaged oncivil work.  This is, I submit, wholly indefensible.     It is agreed that the introduction of industrial com-pulslon is politically impossible.  So long as this is so,it appears to me to be undesirable to countenance indirectcompulsion.  In fact, to do so is worss than undesirable,it is foolish; becaa.se it Incurs the odium of compulsionwithout its compensating results and lays the Governmentopen to charges of breach of faith.     Sooner or later we shall have to join issue with thepacifist and revolutionary sections of the community.  Ifwe are to win, we must carry with us public opinion, Includeing the public opinion of labour generally.  To secure thisour case and record must be clear.  Already we are suffering-from the ill effects of indirect compulsion.  It has createda definite resistance to recruiting; and this resistance laincreasing.  Men, who would be willing to join the Array tofight, have the liveliest objection to being conscriptedand placed on military pay in order to be returned to theircivil work as soldiers.  I have drawn attention to this intwo Memoranda,  (G.T.2236 and 2307).  In the letter from theSecretary of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation
                   mm 3attached to the second of these Memoranda, a case is quotedof a docker who was called to the Colours on the 13thSeptember, and within 10 days was returned as a soldier, undermilitary discipline, to exactly the same class of work asthat upon which he was engaged before he joined the Army,      In this connection it is Interesting to note that oneof the reasons which led the Labour Members to withdraw fromthe Port and Transit Committees in July was the introductionof Transport Workers Battalions where civilian labour wasalleged to be available.  (See Mr. Joseph Davies&apos;Memorandum, G.T.2281).      Very strong representations have also been made to meby my Labour Advisory Committee,      It is hardly necessary to add that, while this fosim of1indirect industrial compulsion is regarded with deep distrustby many loyal working men, it is hailed with delightby every pacifist and revolutionary agitator as a means ofcollecting adherents to the extreme section of labour andundermining the stability of the Government.      These conditions are, I submit, more than sufficient todecide the case against industrial compulsion by militarilycompelled labour.  But apart from the question of good faith,its adverse effect upon recruiting, and its indirectinfluence on national morale, the system is itself unsound.It solves minor problems and creates large ones.      There are important outstanding demands for labour forcivil work.  If these demands are to be met it will necessi-tate the transfer from time to time of considerable numbersof workmen of different classes as and when required by theenrolment of War Munitions Volunteers and War Work Volunteers.
These enrolments are entirely voluntary.  They oan onlybe effected on a satisfactory scale by the assistance ofTrade Unions, and if, owing to the indirect extension ofindustrial compulsion, Labour becomes still moresuspicious of the Government handling of labour, thatco-operation will not be forthcoming and the scheme will           xbreak down.        It should therefore I think be made perfectlyclear that no man is to be retained in the Army who isnot genuinely required in the Army for purely militarypurposes.  If the country can be satisfied that thispolicy is being honestly carried out, I foresee a con-siderable diminution in the existing resistance torecruiting.        Various existing instances, of Military labour areconsidered in some detail in Part II.BIOTE.    A rumour is already current in Woolwich that      any man who enrols as a War Munitions Volunteer,      will probably be called upon to work in Prance,      and the local Branch of the A.  S.  E.  are reported      to be advising their Members not to enrol,
     EXISTING INSTANCES OF EMPLOYMENT OF MILITARY LABOUR.    (a)  The Labour employed by the Inland Water Transport,as used at present, Is theoretically legitimate.  It consistsof military companies drawing R.E. pay, and employed on suchmilitary work as the construction of aerodromes^ cross-channelferries, train ferries, shipyard construction and shipbuildingfor military purposes, and work on camp railways (interchange-ably with France).   In a few cases where men have been sent towork for civil contractors they have, I understand, boon trans-ferred to Class W. Reserve, and do not Y/ork under militarydiscipline or military control.    A suggestion has, however, been made that units of theInland Water Transport should be used for the construction ofnevf slips and for ship construction in ne&apos;w yards 0   I shouldstrongly doprocate such a proceeding.    The great majority of tho Works and Labour Companies putat the disposal of Chief Engineers in Commands also are legiti-mately employed, although the practice is followed of lendingmen from such Companies to help civilian contractors when theyget into difficulties,   I am told that this practice is dis-couraged by the War Office.   It appears, however,  to be resort-ed to not infrequently.   Within the last few days  I have myselfseen a squad of soldiers, fine healthy looking men, doing excava-tion work at Messrs. Thornycrofts Motor Works.   It would be wellI think, that this practice be discontinuede    The A*S.C. Companies engaged on the work of the ForageCommitteo are also engaged on purely military work,  and arenot open to objection.
9 QLa    (b)    The  position  with rogard to the Transport WorkersBattalions is  more difficult.    As originally conceived theproject was not open to objection.   It was originallyintended to invite dockers, whom it was necessary, on militarygrounds, to retain in the Home Defence Forca, to transfer tospecial battalions where they would be employed primarily onmilitary duty, but also would b3 available, subject to thoprior call of their military duty, fordsxsk work in cases wheresufficient civilian labour could not be obtained.   Such aproposal could not bo regarded as objectionable provided it wasclosely adhered to.    In practice, howover, the scheme has been carried farboyond Its original limits.   Men have been onrolled who arenot dockers.  Detachments have been  sent to work on railways atstiel works and on canals;  and It is alleged that they havebeen used  to  compete with and to  coerce  civilian labour.   Itis probable that  these allegations are exaggerated, though arecent case at Bristol has been adversely commented upon by myLabour Advisory Committee.   But oven a few such cases aresufficient to raise suspicion and to jeopardise the scheme.    I therefore submit that these battalions should not beincreased;    that tho greatest caro  should bo taken that theyare not used  to compete with or coerce civilian labour;  andthat no man should be retained in them who is not required asa combatant for Homo Defence.   I would further ask that inorder  to counteract the hostility and suspicion which has beenaroused, an early opportunity should bo taken of declaringpublicly the  status of those battalions and the limits withinwhich they are to be employed.
    (o)    The  Agricultural Companies,  including the TractorCompany,  afford an example of  militarily compelled labour ofalmost the worst kind.   These men are permanently returned toagricultural work.   There is  no intention of recalling them forservice;    they are all  low  category men;   they are distributedsingly, or in two&apos;s and  three&apos;s all over the country;   they aredoing purely civilian work^^jbhey could not be collected tomeet an emergency;   and they would not, judging by the effectof a few weeks&apos; agricultural furlough upon tho average recruit,be very effective if they could be remobilisod,.   The popularityof these companies in the labour world is not increased by thecompulsory Inclusion in their ranks of some active members ofthe textile unions.   There  is, in my opinion, a strong case fornot retaining in the Army the personnel of those companies0    At the risk of some  loss of personnel,  I suggest that sofar as&apos; possible they be  enrolled as War Work Volunteers andassigned to agricultural work, or at least that no furtheragricultural companies be formed.    Generally, I submit  that so long as civil industrial com-pulsion is not legal, any indirect form of such compulsion mustseriously prejudice both recruiting and the enrolment of volun-tary labour for National War Work and must tend to underminepublic confidence in the Government.
