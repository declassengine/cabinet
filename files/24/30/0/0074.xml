Colonel JonesSECRET-:.Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information.DOW/013.            WEEKLY REPORT, ON  GREECE.  XIII.                 (1 November,  1917).     The  Greek  Chamber  re-assembled on October 1 and sat tillOctober 26, when  it was adjourned sine die.    The debates were con-cerned almost wholly with two  topics - the financial and economicsituation and the  enquiry into the conduct of the anti-VenizelistGovernments.  The  latter may be considered first.The Parliamentary  Commissions  of Enquiry.     The  two Parliamentary Commissions appointed to examine theMinisters who composed  the Skouloudhis and Lambros Cabinets begantheir sittings  before Parliament re-assembled.   Some of theMinisters of the  two Cabinets  accused came readily before theCommission, their  line  of defence against  the charges made againstthem being either  that  they were not acquainted with the secretpolicy of the camarilla that controlled Greek foreign policy, orthat they had themselves joined these,Cabinets in the hope of beingable to improve relations  with the Entente Powers.   ProfessorLambros,  who refused to appear and had finally to be arrested andbrought before  the Commission, took a more defiant line.  Mr Rallis,again, refused  to  defend himself before any Court but Parliament,and Mr Skouloudhis, who is not a deputy, declared that he wouldonly appear before a proper Court of Justice.   As a result of theexamination of  various  Ministers accused many interestingrevelations came  to light, and the accused admitted the pro-Germanintrigues of the  King and the  Court camarilla, while declaring thatthey themselves had had no part in these intrigues.   Certain of the
accused,  among them Messrs Iliopoulos,  Kharilaos and Aryiropoulos,who were  members of the Lambros Government,  were finallyexonerated by the Commission,  which on October 20 submitted tothe Chamber its report on the  conduct of the Lambros Government.On the following day a similar report on the conduct of theSkouloudhis Government was submitted to the  Chamber.   Mr Rallismade a long speech in his defence,  but failed to convince theChamber,  which on October 23 voted  by large  majorities thatMessrs Skouloudhis, Rallis,  Dhraghoumis, Khatzakos, Ghounaris(now in Corsica) and other members  of the two Cabinets should bebrought before a specially constituted High  Court of Justice,the judges composing which have been nominated by lot.     The Greek press continues to be full of revelations as to thepro-German intrigues of King Constantine and his Ministers, - thecorrespondence that passed between  him and Berlin, as well asdocuments showing that the formation of the  Reservists&apos; Leaguesand guerilla bands to harass the Entente armies were suggestedby  Germany.   Though these revelations have a particular interestfor Venizelists, they are possibly  now of little importancefrom the point of view of international pclitics.     The Ecclesiastical Commission  appointed to try Theoklitos(Metropolitan of Athens) and some 15 other bishops who took partin the anathema ceremony against Venizelos and in other anti-Venizelist intrigues pronounced their first  sentence on October 8.The Metropolitan and several of his colleagues were sentenced todeposition from their office and relegated as simple monks tointernment for a long period in monasteries.   Similar sentenceswill probably be passed on the other bishops.     Similarly,various professors of the University who owed their appointmentsto anti-Venizelist intrigues have been dismissed from the
University of Athens.     The  same purge has, therefore, new beenapplied to the Church and the University as was applied to themilitary command and the judicial, police and civil service.     Now that undesirable and disloyal elements in the publicservice have been got rid of, the Government has announced thatit intends to return to the principle of the immovability ofpublic officials which had temporarily to be suspended in theinterests of efficient administration.   This decision has beengreeted with enthusiasm both  by the Venizelist press and by anti-Venizelist papers such as the Esperinon Neon Asti.     The Commission to examine into claims for indemnificationmade by the victims of anti-Venizelist outrages has also nearlyconcluded Its labours.  Some  300 applications have been consideredand claims to the amount of 300 million drs. made.   Only a muchsmaller sum (raised by an internal loan) will, of course, beallocated.Financial and Economic Debates in the Chamber.     On October 6 the Minister of Finance, Mr Neghropondis, sub-mitted the 1917 budget.   He  set forth in full the desperatesituation in which the anti-Venizelist Governments has involved thefinances of the State.        (1) The 1914 budget  had shown a surplus of 76 million drs.In reality there should only  have been 38 million drs. when thefull expenditure of the years 1912/13 had been accounted for.At the end of 1915 the surplus was only 8 millions.        (2) The 1916 budget will show a deficit of 160 millions.Further, 43 millions are to be added for the financial relief  ofrefugees etc, but this expense will be transferred to the 1917budget.   Something like 400  million drs. were  wasted during
 1916/17 on unconstitutional expenses.        (3) Coming to the 1917 budget the Minister showed that ordinary revenue amounts to 209 millions, ordinary expenditure to 432 millions:   a deficit of 223 millions.   In this is included the military expenditure of 120 millions, so that excluding this the ordinary deficit is 103 millions.   Extraordinary revenue amounts to 59 millions:  extraordinary expenditure to 163 millions: a deficit of 104 millions.   The total deficit, therefore, excluding military expenditure, is 207 millions;  total revenue 268 millions; total expenditure 595 millions.  From loans Greece is getting 150 millions,  or, subtracting 13 millions for the service of this debt, 137 millions.   This brings the net deficit to 190 millions. The ordinary revenue for 1917 is less by 15,641,581 drs. than that of 1916.  The  ordinary expenditure for 1917, on the other hand, is greater by 133,663,044 drs. than that of 1916.   fchile the total expenditure for 1916 came to 469,361,298, that for 1917 came to 595,912,993.   The total deficit for 1917 is greater&quot; than that for 1916 by 66,019,736.     &quot;Under these conditions&quot;, went on the Minister ,&quot;the situation of the State is truly not a rosy one, but it could not be otherwise considering the fatal policy of my predecessors,  and we knew itwhen we took office.   Fe were under no illusion;  we are sure thatboth in our political and our economic efforts we shall have the support of our great Allies&quot;.     Three methods are proposed for meeting this  difficult financial situation:          (1)   A tax on alcohol.          (2)   An increased tax on war profits,  especially on               shipping profits (this is forcibly demanded by               the whole Greek press).
           (3) An internal loan.Further,  the press rumours that H.  Sergeant, whose financialmission to Greece was alluded to in the last Report, has let ithe known that he will recommend a loan of 500 million drs. toGreece by France and Britain.   This,  of course, has not beenauthoritatively stated,  but apparently great expectations areentertained.  Ministers  lose no opportunity of stating that theyintend to raise the necessary revenue  by the taxation of the wellto-do classes and that they have the warmest sympathy with thepoor, on whom they will  impose  no further burdens.    In fact,as Mr Mikhalakopoulos (Minister of  Agriculture) declared in animportant speech at Patras on October  7, the Government issetting aside 92 millions for the relief of refugees and soldiersfamilies.Economic Distress.     There is certainly wide-spread, if unreasonable, disappoint-ment that Greece&apos;s accession to the side of the Central Powershas not been followed by the speedy solution of her economicdifficulties.    The Me stager d&apos;Athenes (September 20), forinstance, refers to the promises made  by M. Jonnart on June 16and complains that the hopes raised than have not yet beenrealised.  &quot;In fact, conditions have changed for the worse&quot;.Bread, rice, vegetables, meat,  cheese  and butter are all verydifficult to obtain;  this is,  of course, especially true of thetowns.    Mr Venizelos,  who has himself taken the post ofMinister of Supplies, has therefore hastened to improve themeans of transport with a view  to bringing to Athens vegetablesand other produce from the Peloponnese.  (The Government proposesto bring all the railways of the country under State control,
   at present the  systems are very badly co-ordinated.   The questionof transport by sea is  also engaging their attention, and it ishoped that the Entente  Powers will allow further shipping for itsservice).     On October 6 a searching house-to-house investigationwas made by the police  in Athens and Piraeus with a view todiscovering the exact numbers and needs of the population.   Itwas found  that the Lambros Government had distributed bread andother cards freely to their partisans, but not to other citizens.Cards have now been distributed for food and fuel on a properscale.  (There are different cards for the purchase of twelvedifferent  commodities),   The bread ration has now been increasedfrom 50 to 100 drams;  wide-spread satisfaction has been expressedat this step.   The Minister of Provisioning, Mr Embirikos, haspromised that by November 2 the situation will be well in hand andthat Greece can be assured of sufficient food for the next fewmonths.    Possibly this is an over-optimistic statement, but ithas been seized on with joy by the Greek press.   As is pointedout in a very interesting report from Mr Crackanthorpe to MrBalfour, dated Athens October 4^ much cf the distress, especiallyin Thessaly, is due to  the incompetence and local jealousies of theGreek authorities.   But whatever the cause of the distress, it isvital both in the  interests of the reputation of Mr Venizelos andof friendly relations between Greece and the Entente Powers thateverything possible should be done to meet Greek economic necessities,I                                          -                                                                      jotherwise  it will  be impossible to proceed to a full mobilisation,and the feeling will gain ground that Greece has suffered bythrowing in her lot with the Entente Powers.Pro-T^ar and Anti-War Parties.     Mr Crackanthorpe1a report goes in some detail into the questionof anti-Venizelist feeling in the provinces.   It is certain that
in the Peloponnese, the home of clan feeling and parochialism,there is still very strong resentment felt against Venizelos.Partly owing to a feeling of loyalty to King Constantine, partlyowing to the activities of Reservists&apos; Leagues,  aid partly owingto the self-interest of loje\cjl politicians, the Peloponnese,except for towns like Patras, has been for a long time pastcompletely anti-Venizelist.   Anti-Venizelist agents can nowplay on the dislike of the demobilised troops to taking partin the war.   Venizelist Ministers have made great efforts tocope with this feeling, and in his speech at Patras on October 7Mr Mikhalakopoulos hastened to say:  &quot;As to mobilisation, theGovernment has recognised that it would not be just that those whofought in two wars and are worn out by an aimless 10 months&apos;mobilisation, which was maintained for personal reasons and cost400 million drs., should be called again to the colours;  insteadit will call up those who then stayed behind&quot;.   It is obviouslyas yet too dangerous for the Government to attempt a generalmobilisation;  on the other  -hand, the 1916 and 1917 classesappear to have responded to the call to arms very well in mostparts of Greece.    The Governments main argument to induce warenthusiasm seems to be to dwell on &quot;the necessity of sacrificeswhich v/ill show the Peace Conference the value of Greece&apos;s co-operation&quot; (Mr Mikhalakopoulos at Patras).    Martial law isin force in the greater part of the country and there seems to belittle danger of a definite insurrection.   The tone of the anti-Venizelist papers is scrupulously polite to Venizelos, but thePatris complains that they show no enthusiasm for the newGovernment or for whole-hearted participation in the war andprefer to dwell on minor points in their leading articles.
international Relations.    Mr Venizelos has been  compelled  to  postpone  his departurefrom Athens, as his presence  there  is required for the solutionof the difficult provisioning question.    These  is still some difficulty between the Greek and Italianauthorities over the maintenance  of the  Italian occupation ofKonitsa, but for the time being Greco-Italian relations are lessstrained as both countries  are occupied  with other urgent questions.The intrigues  of  certain Italian officials among the population of                                                   AEpirus,  pointed out  by Mr Crackanthorpe in his report, are mostunfortunate, as they not only embitter relations between Greeceand Italy,  but may also arouse old Greco-Rumanian quarrels whichhad happily died  down.The Situation  of  the Greeks  in Turkey.     Almost daily the Greek  press publishes further informationas to the wretched condition of the Greeks of the Turkish Empire.Exaggerated as many  of these reports may be, there is little doubtthat the Turkish  authorities have carried out a systematiceviction of the Greek population  of the coast of Asia Minor.The inhabitants are  sent to  the interior and nothing is known asto their fate. The  reason given by the Turks is thfet the Greekshad been guilty of espionage and helping the Entente fleets, but,according to admissions made by various Turkish authorities, theobject of these persecutions is to destroy the Greek element ofAsia Minor  in  favour of the  Turks and their German Allies, who haveapparently suggested and supported a policy of extermination, asin the case of the Armenians.  It is hoped before long that a fullaccount of  these  persecutions will be published.     The attitude of the Greeks of Trebizond and other parts of
1.11.17.Asia Minor in Russian occupation is interesting.   First-handwitnesses testify to the friendly relations which prevail betweenthe Greeks and the occupying Russian army in Trebizond.The one horror of these Greek populations is that they should bereturned to the Turkish yoke, and this fear gained currencyoYfing to the policy of no-annexation proclaimed by the RussianSocialists.  Consequently,  Greeks from the Black Sea coastliving in France and Russia have formed a committee under thepresidency of a certain Konstandinidhis.   Their programme isas follows:  &quot;If the Russian Republic wishes to hold Trebizondand the Black Sea provinces which it has freed, the Greeks there,not wishing to raise questions likely to embarrass France, Russia&apos;sAlly, will make no objection to this course.   But in caseRussia, In conformity with  the declarations she has made,  weredisposed not to continue to hold these territories, then theGreek provinces of the Black Sea are opposed to a return to Turkishrule and desire to form an  independent republic&quot;.   In view ofhhe latter possibility a permanent &quot;Council of the Greeks  of theBlack Sea&quot; is being formed  in Paris, and Mr Konstandinidhis pointsout that it would represent the wishes of something like one millionGreeks living along the Black Sea coast in towns like Trebizond,Ordu, Kiresun and Samsun.
