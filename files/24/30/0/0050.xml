&apos;:r.;         (This Document is the Property of   &apos;OPERATIONS.                   S E G R E T.   prom :- General DeLmc Radcliffe, Italy.    0  :-   C.I. G.S., V/ar Office.If                                    Handed in 9.40 p,m. 30th Oct. 1917.                                     Received  7.0  a.m. 31st Oct. 1917.   No. 525.     October 30th.                Following is this morning.&quot;s situation.                3rd Army.  All artillery now on the right bank of the   Tagliamento.  23rd and 13th Army Corps are about Latisana. ? 25th   is passing at Madrisio.  11th and Sth are passing by the 2 railway                                                                *   bridges and 1 road bridge west of Codroipo.                Little is known of 2nd Army except that it is pressing   towards the Tagliamento in disordered state rendering the passages   near Codroipo difficult for 3rd Army.  At Sacile about 100,000   fugitives are -being collected.   They are all quiet and show no   signs of mutinous tendency.                 Retirement is said to be still covered by 5 detachments   under Generals Etna, Petiti Ferrero and Paolini on the line between   Fagagna, Lestizza and Muzzana Del Turgnano.   Yesterday cavalry came   into action at Campoformido and Italian counter-attack is said to   be now  in progress.                 Italian aircraft Headquarters has been established at   Aviano  and their machines fly all over the plain without meeting   enemy aircraft which appear only to have dropped some bombs at   Casarsa.                 Last night I saw Duke of Aosta.  He is facing the   situation with coolness and considers that under the circumstances   3rd Army has done well.                Commando Supremo intends to occupy line of the   Tagliamento from Osoppo to the sea with 3rd Army General Di Giorio&apos;s   detachment of 2jr divisions and any still serviceable units of 2nd   Army, allowing bulk of 2nd Army pass through and be reformed in rear.-j
 t in  calculated  that  15 days  should  be  sufficient for the purpose  d that  flooded  state of  tho  River and  tho  bridge-head defences may^vri it eossible  to  check  tho  enemy long enough before returning onto tho Piavo.            Garnia  Force  is to  take  up  a line  from the heed of theArzene Valley  through  the  Force,  di Monte Res to  to the &quot;Mauri a Passwhere  it  joins the 4th Army.                                       356            Tdgliamento line  is 60 kilometres  long and the Piavelino to the  foot  of  the hills  only 35.    It  is  proposed that the3rd Army  should hold Piave line  from  Suseegana  bridge to San Donadi Piave  below which the country is being flooded.            It is proposed that the  British and French divisionsshould hold  the next sector already prepared for defence up toPederobbo.   4th  Army  line would pass over Monte Grappa to theAsiago plateau.            Concerning an enemy offensive from tho Trentino thereis some anxiety.   Tho Stelvio is occupied by a few troops, but atthis season little danger  is  apprehended.   Val Camonica is stillpracticable and is held by 15  battalions.   The Giudicarie is amore dangerous line  and is now held by 1 division to be reinforcedby 2 first  (sic)  divisions of  the 3rd Army which can be despatchedthither.            Another dangerous point  is  the Asiago plateau and thetroops are  to  be  reinforced at Thiene by 1 Corps from the 3rd Army.At the present moment  there is no pressure from forces in theTrentino  and if this does  not  come within the next 20 days snow-willprobably  much  reduce possible  areas  of operations.   Cadorna thinksthat possibly  the line of  Tagliamento could be  held, for a month,                                                                       ife+spooially if  the high water continues and when re-tiring &amp; J^ood- inter-mediate position  can be taken up on  the  Livenza.             It is hoped  that  all the troops will have crossed theTagliamento by to-morrow evening.   In consequence, to-day, to-nightand to-morrow  constitute  a very critical period. j
)             Commando Supremo and the Staffs appear  to  have  lost contact and control to a considerable extent.      Communications services are not working well and supply services  very  much  dis- organized.   Consequently troops must be in many cases  almost  star- ving and artillery can have very little ammunition witfc it,.  Supplies of  food are being sent forward and also ammunition  but distribution is  difficult and cohesicn of supplies has been  lost.             Direction of the roads east of Tagliamento renders  the retreat more difficult, as theru are only S3 principal lines  running east to west and 1 or 2 intermediate oneSi   General direotion of roads, on the other hand, is north-east to south-west,  thus  facil- itating movement of enemy columns across area of 2nd Army  on to  left flank of 3rd Army.   Between the Tagliamento and the Piave road system is more favourable, aa there are 9 separate main roads  by which troops can move.             Whether the sohemes of the Commands Supreme can be carried *ut, depends entirely upon the morale of the  Army and the amount of  troops that can be used effectively as soon  as  Tagliament^  has been crossed.   It aeems that many units are still free from the demoralizing influence which&apos;produced the rout, and  they may be pulled together and act well on the defensive.   But result  would be  very serious if the enemy presses with any vigour on the  retreat- Ing Army now.
