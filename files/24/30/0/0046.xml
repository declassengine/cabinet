SECOND (INTERIM) REPORT OF THE ARMY DEMOBILISATION COMMITTEE.

MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF RECONSTRUCTION.

I submit the Second Report of the Army Demobilisation Committee for the consideration of the War Cabinet and I recommend that the principles on which it is based be generally approved, subject to the further examination and adjustment of certain details.

 In order that the scheme may be fully worked out before the end of the War, it is important that its essential outlines should be settled at once, and I accordingly ask for the immediate adoption of the following main recommendations:-

(1)That the soldiers in France should be brought home and discharged as rapidly as possible and that men should be released from the Armies at home at an approximately equal rate.

 It is estimated that it may be possible to transport as many as 20,000 men per day from France; and on the assumption that an equivalent rate of demobilisation takes place in the forces at home the total number to be discharged per day may reach 40,000. Only about 60% of the forces can however be demobilised at the maximum rate; the remainder must be retained with the cadres for handling stores etc, and can only be released gradually over a considerable period. From the men available for discharge must also be deducted the number required to form the future standing Army.

 The Committee express the view that it would be unjustifiable to keep men with the Colours merely because their rapid discharge might cause a congestion of the labour market,  
and that, while steps must be taken by the State to relieveany such congestion, the men must net bo kept in ths Armylonger than..jaay.b-s necessary on mU^Ltary grounds.   I donot &quot;thinkvthat this view can be contested and I agree thatin fairness to all concerned the rate of discharge from theArmies at home and in Prance ought to be kept approximatelythe same.   In order that the: plans for bringing men home ram abroad may be worked out, it is desirable that theForeign. Office should be authorised to negotiate; at theearliest possible date with Prance and &quot;Belgium as regardsport facilities and with Holland as regards th*? return ofprisoners and those interned,, and to obtain,. If possible,from fpain permission for the repatriation by rail ofPortuguese troops and labourers whe may be in France,(2)   That, subject to military exigencies in individualoases, the order of discharge should be governed fcy^the.needs of trade and industry, or, in other words, thatthose men should be released first for whom immediateemployment is ascertained tc be available or who belongto the industries most important to the. life of the nation,preference being given, wherever possible to married men.I would add that regard should also be had,  s.o far as possible,to length of service,      I think that the alternative method^ namely to bring homethe armies  in Prance by military formations,  is  open to de-cisive objectionsc      It has been suggested  that this  method would make dlscip-iine,  necessarily a difficult matter when fighting is  over,easier to maintain.    But I  understand that  it would take Atleast four  times  as long to  bring over the  complete units,and that the cross-journeyings Involved when the men weredischarged  on this side(which will be  avoided under theCommittee&apos;s scheme)  would impose an impossible strain  on
on the railway in this country,  Again the order of the dischargeof the men would be governed by no principle which could be  explainedto the men themselves,, or defended against public criticism,  Whatis even more important, this method would greatly increase the  diff.i-culty of resettling men in their former occupations and would makeit impossible to provide for the speedy return to Civil employ^ment ,of men most urgently needed by the important industries of thecountryo   For these reasons I hold strongly that acceptance of theprinciple laid down by the Committee is fundamentally essentialto the maintenance of social order and industrial reconstructionafter the War.   It will be observed that the Committee l&apos;s scheme(Para 13) leaves ample discretion to commanding Officers in makingup drafts to be sent home for discharge.          If this principle bo adopted, the Committee!s schemeprovides arrangements whereby assistance may be given throughthe Employment Exchanges and Trade Unions in securing the returnof the men to civil employment and a priority list cf industriesdrawn up according to circumstances.          As regards provision against unemployment it will beremembered that the late Government approved the recommendationcontained in the Committee&apos;s First Report that in addition to amonths furlough on ft.ll pay and allowances -and a War gratuity&quot;the soldier should receive a free unemployment insurance  policyvalid for one year.   It was originally proposed that the rateof unemployment benefit should be 10/- a week, but the Committeenow think that in view of the more rapid rate of discharge nowcontemplated this may be sufficient.   They accordingly recommendthat the legislation providing for the unemployment benefit shouldauthorise the Ministry of Labour to increase the rate,  If necessaryafter consideration by the Central Demobilisation Committee who willmake recommendations as to the rate, to bo paid, and with the consentcf the Treasury,, regard being had tc/&apos;
901ki (j i-nt/to  fix a  precise  figure.  At the same time I do not thinkthe circumstances immediately following tne  end of the War,including the cost of living and  current rates  of wages.  Ithink that an increase of the original  rate  will he necessarybut that the Committee are right  in not attempting at the presentmoiuenthat the flat rate of 10/- will be &amp;igh enough  to withstand public;criticism, and, in view of the Committeels frank acceptance of thefact that a higher rate will be necessary, I suggest that the flatrate be increased to 15/-.  Legislation will be necessary to give.effect to the proposals relating  to unemployment insurance and Iask that the Ministry of Labour should  be authorised to introduceit at an early date,     .  .    The. Committee, also propose that  a  statutory right should,.,^given to the soldier to priority  of employment  with hi.s^ old:employer,   This is no doubt very desirable  im  principlej but theCommittee apparently do not think it  possible to extend it beyondmen who were in the employment of a particular  employer on the4th August 1914 and remained in the same employment until joiningthe Army, and this proposal is of course subject to the conditionamongst others that the employer  is in  a position to take back theMen,   The number of men who would benefit by the proposal evensupposing that it is practicable,  to enforce  it  upon unwillingemployers, would therefore not be as  large as might at firstsight appear,    Cn the other hand it is estimated  as the result of inquiriesmade by the Industrial Section of the Board  of  Trade% early inthe present year?that some 62 per cent  of the men serving withthe Colours have; in one form or another promises  of reinstatement;*tth their former employers.  I think that better results  areP-ikeiy to be obtained by relying  upon these  promises and upon  thepressure of public opinion than by attempting legisiatipn which canpuy apply to a limited number of men and which it may be  administraR-veiy Vsry difficult to enforce..   I propose therefore that thispatter, should be further investigated before  the  Committee^
 recommendation as proceeded with.

There are two special points in the Report to the arrangements as regards Officers and men of like standing on which an immediate decision is sought, viz:-

(a) There are a certain number of Officers and men whose reasonable claims for assistance would not be met by unemployment insurance. The Committee propose that this should be arranged for by continuing the present Civil Liabilities Committee after the War, and that a detailed scheme should be drawn up for the consideration of the Treasury. As this will take some time, I propose that the Civil Liabilities Committee should be authorised to proceed to prepare a scheme without delay.

(b) It is clearly desirable that some general arrangements should also be made to assist the resettlement in Civil life of officers and men of like standing. A Sub-Committee including representatives of the Inns of Courts and Artists officers Training Corps, which was specially appointed under the Chairmanship of Sir Reginald Brade to consider the matter recommended - and the Committee endorse their recommendation - that an Appointments Board should be established for this purpose under the control of the Ministry of Labour to co-operate with the existing University Appointments Board and other bodies. The officials of the proposed Board would be drawn as far as possible from among ex-officers.

In order that the Sub-Committee may proceed further with their task it is necessary that they should know that the Government approve this proposal. I think that it is desirable also that the decision should be made public with an outline of the Scheme since there is evidence that a number of people interested in the subject are already beginning to set up organisations which may conflict with the scheme, some possibly with a view to making a profit by means of registration fees.

 If the War Cabinet approve of the main principles and particular 



   
 proposals set forth in this memorandum I ask for authority to proceed with the settlement of the various matters of detail involved in consultation with the Departments concerned.

In conclusion I wish to say that in my opinion the Committee have produced a most useful scheme, clearly and carefully thought out and admirably explained, for dealing with this most difficult problem, and I hope that the War Cabinet will suitably acknowledge the value of the work which has been accomplished by the Committee in conjunction with the Departmental Committees of the War Office and Ministry of Labour.

CONFIDENTIAL.MINISTRY OF  RECONSTRUCTION.       SECOND (INTERIM)  REPORT  OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE DEMOBILISATION                                  OF THE ARMY. The Right Hon. Christopher Addison, M.P.,        Minister of Reconstruction. Sir,                                                              October Will.     1. IN our first interim  report  dated the 9th October, &quot;1*916, we dealt in the first place with the benefits to be accorded by the State to  soldiers on demobilisation, and, secondly,  with the machinery to he used in assisting them to return to civil  employ- ment.  The recommendations made by us as regards those benefits  were subsequently approved  by the  late Government.   In  paragraph 23  of the report we pointed out that it would be necessary before we could make  any further progress  with the lask entrusted to us by the Reconstruction  Committee that  we should obtain from  the War  Office a draft scheme of demobilisation.  Since the date of that report, both the  War  Office and the  Ministry of Labour, which  now  takes  the place of  the Board of  Trade   in  this  connection,  have  set  up  Departmental  Demobilisation Committees, which have made great progress with the proposed scheme of  demobilisa- tion on its  military and its  civil side  respectively.  Reports which we now enclose have been received from both these Departments, and  it  will  be  seen that, subject to certain modifications,  we concur generally in their conclusions.  We wish at the outset to express our strong appreciation of the work which has  been so admirably  done by the two committees under circumstances, especially  in  the case of the  War Office Committee, of considerable difficulty and  stress.    2. From the report of the War Office Demobilisation Committee and from state- ments  which have been made by  the War Office representatives at meetings of  the Committee,  it  appears  likely that the  rate  of  demobilisation  may be very much more  rapid  than was  originally suggested.  This acceleration depends, however, on satisfactory arrangements being made for the use during the period of  demobilisation of the French and  Belgian ports.   Facilities will at the same time be required for the return from Holland of the prisoners and interned officers and men who may be in that country at the end  of the war.  The British Government is responsible also for making- provision for the repatriation of the Portuguese troops and labourers who may be in France at  the end of the war, and  our attention has been called  to  the fact that the demands upon shipping would  be appreciably reduced, if permission  could be obtained lor their return by  rail through Spain.  The successful working of demobilisation will depend largely on the settlement of these  matters, and  we recommend accordingly that negotiations should be undertaken through the Foreign Office at  the earliest possible date with the Allied and Neutral Governments concerned, with a view to obtaining the necessary facilities.    3. It will be observed  from the report of the  War Office Committee that, subject to such facilities being obtained, the military authorities  now think that the rate at which it may be possible to  bring men  back from  France may  reach 2U,U.lK)  a  day. We concur in the view of the War Office Committee (Part I, paragraph lii) that, so far as possible, the rate of discharge  from the armies in France  and at home  should be kept approximately equal, and on this  assumption the total number of men dischargedper day may be no less than 40,000.  This increased rate of  demobilisation, which is a source of great satisfaction  to us in view  of the prospect, now dissipated, that theprolonged  retention of large numbers of  men on-the Continent after  the war would  beinevitable, necessitates, in our opinion  certain modifications in our original proposals.    4. The position is discussed in the Memoranda which we print as Appendix  1.1to this Report, and before setting out the modifications which we recommend, we desire to  observe that we  do  not  think that it would be justifiable  to  Keep with the colours men who were enlisted  to serve their country merely because a congestion ofthe labour market might be caused by the rapid discharge of the men.   Steps must      [899-27]                                                         B
be taken by the State to prepare for relieving such a congestion, but, in our opinion, itwould be indefensible to keep  men in the army any longer than may be  necessary onmilitary grounds.  Moreover, in view of the terms of  enlistment of the majority of themen,  it would probably he extremely difficult to retain them for any longer period, andpublic opinion would certainly  demand their release  at as early a date as the workingof the military machine would allow.  (We believe it to he desirable from this point ofview, if from no other, that the Government should decide the meaning  of the words&quot; period of the war.&quot;) It must also be remembered that to retain men in the army wouldhe an extremely expensive proceeding.   Nor do we think that it would be in the interestseither of the State or of the men  themselves to extend the period of four weeks&apos; furlough.We may, however, observe in this connection that, should an armistice of some durationprecede the conclusion  of peace, the practical difficulties of  a  rapid demobilisationwould be appreciably lessened.    5. In view of these considerations, it is necessary to make provision for those men&apos;who,  after discharge, may not be able  to find employment, and for the possibility thatthere may be a  considerable number of such  men, at any rate for a  period.  Weproposed in our interim report, that  the rate  of unemployment benefit should he 10s.per week for a period not exceeding twenty weeks during the year.   Whilst this rateappeared on the data then before us  to be  sufficient to meet what might he calledincidental unemployment due  to the dislocation that would occur, even  in  the mostfavourable circumstances, it scarcely appears  to he sufficient to  meet any prolongedperiod of unemployment.   We have accordingly decided  to recommend  that thelegislation authorising the payment  of unemployment benefit should provide for  a flatrate of 10s. as a minimum, with power to the Ministry of Labour, on the recommenda-tion of the proposed  Central Demobilisation Committee, and with  the consent of theTreasury, to increase the fiat rate, if the circumstances should he deemed to  make anincrease necessary.   In  considering any alteration of  the original rate, regard shouldbe had to all the circumstances  of the period immediately following the termination ofthe war, and  in particular to the cost of  living and current rates of wages.  We havediscussed the question whether we should recommend any definite maximum ; 20s.,25s., and 30s. have been suggested  and respectively received the&apos;support of  differentmembers  of  the Committee.  In view, however, of the difficulty of foreseeing at thepresent  time what the circumstances are likely to  be immediately after the war,  wehave  decided not to put forward any figure, and we recommend therefore that thematter should he  left to be  decided by the Central Demobilisation Committee and theDepartments concerned in the manner proposed.    6. A further modification which we think  is necessary, in  view of the possibilityof a  serious  congestion  of  the labour  market, concerns the  date from which theunemployment policy is  valid.  In  our interim  report  (paragraph  4 (d) ),  werecommended that the policy should be valid for one year from one month after dateof discharge from the army (i.e., we proposed that there should be an  interval of onemonth between the end of the furlough, during which time the man will be in receiptof full pay and  allowances, and the date  at which he might  commence  to  drawunemployment benefit).   We now recommend that  the unemployment policy shouldrun immediately from the end of the furlough ; that is to say, it should be  possiblefor any soldier to  sign the vacant book at the employment exchange or trade union, asthe case may be, during the last week of furlough.  This  will thus constitute thewaiting week, and, if he is still  unemployed, he will be able to obtain benefit at theend of the week immediately following the furlough.    7. We are of opinion that, in  order to avoid serious and justifiable unrest afterthe war, it is  necessary  to assure to the returning soldier a prior right to employmentwith his former employer, if and when such employment is available.  This right issecured in the case of  controlled  establishments by the second  schedule  to &quot;TheMunitions of  War Act, 1915,&quot; and, in  addition, agreements have been made on similarlines  between employers and workpeople in  a  number  of  organised trades &quot;at theinstance  of the  Government,   What has been conceded  to  munition  workers andothers can hardly be denied to the soldiers,  Although the  difficulties of enforcingstatutory provisions are  obvious, we consider that, in order to assist soldiers seekingre-employment and  to make it  easier for employers to dismiss substitutes, this rightshould be  made  general and enforceable by  law.  We recommend accordingly thatlegislation should be introduced providing that  any man who was in the  employmentof a particular employer on the 4th August, 1914, and remained in such  employmentuntil  he joined the army  shall, upon his return, have the right to be reinstated by thatemployer in his original  grade at the current trade union rate of wages, or, if  there isno such rate, at not less than his wages before the war.   This obligation should remain
%i force for a period of three months from the date of the man&apos;s discharge from the army, or two weeks  from the dale (being within  the first year of demobilisation) at which work is offered  by the employer to the man, whichever period be the longer, and it must of course be subject to the condition that the employer is in a position to take back the man.  The fact that a substitute is or is not being employed will in most cases afford a sufficient test  of this condition.  The  obligation should be restricted to the man&apos;s first employment, e.g., if he takes other work after the offer of re employment his employees obligation should lapse.   The right  can be exercised once only:  the failure of the man to present himself for work should cancel the obligation.  It should also be a condition that the  returning soldier is fit  to perform his former work, and, in order to obviate any hardship-which might he caused by the discharge of a substitute at short  notice, that the soldier should  be  required  to give before  the end of  his furlough  at least three weeks&apos; notice  of his intention to return.  The  filling up of  the registration form set  out in Appendix (A) of the report of  the Ministry of Labour Committee and the sending  by the local  Demobilisation Committee of the consequent communication to the employer should be treated as a sufficient notice for this purpose. The notice should be confirmed  by the man within the last week preceding  his return to work, in order to  prevent any dislocation of work through his having- changed his mind or having got work elsewhere.     We recognise that cases of difficulty and dispute may arise for the settlement of which it will  be necessary to provide a rapid and simple procedure, and we recommend that the local Demobilisation Committees should  be given powers to decide disputed questions of fact arising out of a soldier&apos;s claim to reinstatement, and possibly also in special cases, in  which serious  hardship  might otherwise be caused, discretion to relieve the employer of his obligation.     8.  We think  it essential that the Ministry  of Labour should  press  forward  as quickly  as  possible  with  their  plans  for  putting  into  operation  the  proposed arrangements for returning the men to civil employment and for initiating the scheme of Unemployment Insurance, and, in  this  connection, we desire to  urge  strongly  the immediate need  for  the appointment  of  the  Central  Advisory  Committee,  the establishment of which was recommended in paragraph 19 of our first  interim report, and for which, we understand, proposals have been made by the Ministry of Labour to the Cabinet.   It is very important that this Committee  should  be associated with  the scheme at the earliest  possible moment, and  should  advise the  Minister of  Labour with regard to the details before they are finally settled and put into  operation.   We trust that the  Government will find it possible to approve of the appointment of the Committee and its announcement without avoidable delay.     9. As regards the order in which demobilisation  is to be carried out, it  has now been definitely decided that, subject to military exigencies in  particular cases, it will be possible to release men from the armies in France and at home, except those needed as cadres for the care of equipment, stores, horses, &amp;c, according to  the requirements of trade and industry.   We proceed to indicate generally the  methods by which  we think this principle should be applied to those armies.   Different  arrangements which cannot yet be detailed  will  be  necessary  in the case of units serving in the more distant theatres of war and in garrisons overseas, and  it will be understood that the release of any individual  soldier must always be subject to  the condition that his services are not required for military  purposes.   The general  military arrangements under which the process of demobilisation will take place on the continent and at home are described in detail in Part II of the report of the War Office Committee.   We are informed that, since the date  of that report, it has been decided that Method (B) is to be adopted.     10. We recommend&quot; that special  arrangements should he made  with  the  War Office by the Ministry of  Labour before the end of the war, if possible, for priority in  demobilisation  immediately  peace is  assured of  men  specially  required  in connection with the work of demobilisation, for example, the officers of the War Office and the  Employment  Department  serving with the  colours,  police, and  a certain number of men belonging to  the railway services.   These and  similar men should  be demobilised in advance of all others,, as their services  are necessary in order to carry out the subsequent  stages of demobilisation.  The question how far these special arrangements can be extended to  other men belonging to  the  public  services or  to similar &quot; pivotal&quot; men in industry should be further considered by the  War Office and Ministry of Labour after consultation with the Departments concerned.   It  will also be necessary to include in the preliminary stages of demobilisation men who undertake to continue their  service after the war,  especially those who will  have to he sent
out to relieve the units now serving  overseas, a large number of whom  belong to theTerritorial Force., We understand that the arrangements  for the repatriation of theDominion contingents have already been decided by the Government, and we thereforemake no recommendations on this head.     11.  The subsequent general order of  demobilisation becomes  of  less importancethan we  originally contemplated, if the period within  which it is to take place provesto be  as short  as the military authorities now anticipate.   We  recommend  that itshould be carried out on  the &quot;principle  that the men to be disbanded first are thosefor whom immediate employment is known to be available,  and who are required lorrestarting on a peace basis  the more important industries  of the country. ^ Subjectto this principle, preference should  also be given  to the married men.  The plansproposed in which we concur provide for this in the following manner.   As indicatedin Part II, paragraph 26, of the report  of the  War Office  Committee, the militaryauthorities have  already taken steps to secure the classification of all men serving withthe colours into occupational groups  (see Appendix  0 to the report of the Ministry ofLabour Committee),  and this information, together with the fact whether  he is marriedor single, is marked on  a document  in the soldiers possession.   In addition  eachsoldier will, as long  before  the probable date of disbandment as is possible, fill in aregistration form giving particulars, inter alia, of his home address, employer previousto enlistment, and his industrial experience.   A  draft  of this form is set forth inAppendix A of the report of tho Departmental  Committee  of the Ministry  of Labouron demobilisation procedure.  These forms will be sent to the Ministry of Labour, wherethey will be distributed to the local offices (exchanges or local agencies) for the  area inwhich soldiers intend to reside on demobilisation, and the local  offices will thereupon&quot;communicate with each mans former employer  and trade union (if  any) in order tofind out whether employment is available for him upon his return, and,  if so, at  whatdate.  In each case  in which a guarantee  of immediate employment is obtained, the&quot; tear off &quot; slip at the foot of the registration form  containing the man&apos;s name, homeaddress,  and military particulars will  be  turn  off  and  returned to his commandingofficer stamped with  a letter or symbol indicating that, subject to military requirements,the men  should be included amongst those destined for early release.  The scheme thusbriefly described is fully  set forth in  paragraphs  11  to  41  of the report  of  theMinistry of  Labour Committee,  and  we  have  only  to  add  that,  with a  viewto the avoidance of  delay, we attach great importance to effective arrangements beingmade for the speedy despatch of the tear-off slips to the officer commanding the unitwith which the man  is serving.     12.  In addition, the Ministry of Labour will draw up, at. the end of  the war,  withthe help  of data  now being obtained  and in the light of the industrial conditions of thecountry at the time,  a priority list of  trades and occupations.  This list will consist ofa selection by classes of  the forty-one industrial groups under  which  the men areclassified in their pay-books.   The selection will be based on such considerations as theimportance of restoring particular trades to full  working order from the national pointof view and  the prospects which  they offer for  immediate employment, regard beinghad to the facilities for export, raw materials, &amp;c.  The first class might, for example,consist  of  agriculture,  shipbuilding,  railways, and  coal-mining ;  the  second  ofemployees  of public and  local authorities, seamen and  fishermen,  iron  and  steelmanufactures, and so on.   This list  will be communicated by the War  Office  to thecommanding officers  in order that, in addition to the men in respect of whom earlyrelease slips  have been sent to them by the Ministry of  Labour, they may select menaccording to the entries on their pay  books, showing the occupational groups to whichthey belong under the classification referred to in the last paragraph.  In framing thepriority  list the Ministry  of Labour will be  guided by the relative urgency of thevarious  industrial requirements  of  the country.   As previously  stated, preferenceshould be given  in all classes, so far  as possible,  to married men.     13.  It may be convenient if we give here an example of how the foregoing generalrules may be expected to work :      After the &quot;pivotal&quot;  men and men engaging for the new army have  been  senthome, commanding officers will have to make up drafts of men to be sent down to thereception camps in order to  he sent home to the dispersal  stations (nearest in each  caseto their homes)- from  which they will be disbanded.  Let us suppose that a commandingofficer has to make up on a given day a draft of twenty men.   If he has twenty or moreearly release slips in respect  of men under his command, he will make up his draft frommen in respect of whom he has received these  slips.  If the number of men  in thedraft is smaller than  the number of men for whom he has slips, he will give preference
                               lllli SI;to married men, and to men belonging to occupational groups included in the priority^St&apos; If the commanding officer has fewer slips in respect of men under his command,then the number of  the draft required will include  all the men in  respect of whom hehas slips in his draft, and he will  select men to complete  the draft from  the tradeswhich have been given first priority in the priority list, and, if more are  required, hewill  add  married men belonging to  other trade groups.  This will probably enablehim  to complete his draft; if  not, he  must make it up according to  his  discretion,.with men for whom he has no slips and who belong to other trades, as it will he under-stood that, towards the close of demobilisation, the drafts will tend to consist more andmore of men for whom there  are no early release slips and no trade priority. ^ In theearly days, of course, it may be  expected that all the men in each draft will either bemen in respect of whom the commanding officer has received slips or who belong topriority trades.      ,                                               ^     In all cases it  will he understood that men will only be released if their servicesare not required for military purposes.     14. We  recommend  that  a  small  Inter-Departmental Committee  should  heconstituted for dovetailing the schemes of the two Departments, and we think that thisCommittee should sit as often as  may be necessary during the period of demobilisationin order  to  settle revised instructions with regard to priority which may  appear to berendered necessary  on public  grounds or by the state of employment in the differentindustries.   The Ministry of Labour should obtain the necessary information from thepublic Departments and the industries concerned.   The  Committee will also considerthe arrangements for dealing  with the &quot;tear-off&quot; slips  referred to  in paragraph 11above.     15. We have dealt in the preceding paragraphs with the most important parts ofthe proposed machinery of demobilisation as outlined in  the Reports of the War Officeand  Ministry of Labour  Committees.  Various  modifications of the detailed arrange-ments  set forth in  these reports will be necessary.  Many points have already  beendiscussed between the two Departments concerned,  and an agreement has been cometo on a number  of  matters.   A list of the  modifications  agreed upon, and  of  thealterations  required  by  the  recommendations  contained  in  this  report,  is beingprepared  and will  he forwarded  shortly, and it will  be understood that furtherchanges of detail may he found  necessary as the  result of subsequent considerationand discussion betwreen the Departments.   Subject to this  observation,  we think thatthose reports embody satisfactory means, on the military and civil side respectively, forcarrying successfully into effect the principles recommended by us.     16. We have considered the  question of the method  of  payment of war gratuitiesand arrears of pay, with special relation to the scheme which has been placed before usfor opening a special account at the Post Office Savings Bank for such men concerned.The  correspondence  between the late  Postmaster-General  and Home  Secretary  andthe Chairman, and  memoranda by Mr. Leith  Ross and  Sir  R. Brade on the subjectare printed  in Appendix. III.  It will be seen  that  there  are serious  administrativeobjections to any arrangements for the use of Savings Bank machinery&apos;&apos; which are notuniform and compulsory.   In view of the experience of previous similar schemes, itseems doubtful whether any such arrangements could be  successfully enforced or thatsufficient  benefit  would result to justify the trouble and  expense  of  attempting to-carry them out. The most important consideration, in our judgment, is that the moneyshould not be paid to the men until  thev  reach  home;  and we understand that theWar  Office  propose, in the absence of any special  arrangements, to pay it in threeequal instalments during the period of  furlough   We think that  this  safeguard willhe sufficient, and in these circumstances we are unable to recommend the adoption ofany special scheme for the use  of the Savings Bank.     17. As indicated in paragraph  20 of  our  first  report, we are of opinion that inaddition to the grant of free Unemployment Insurance it is necessary that arrangements.should he made for giving special assistance to certain officers  and men in likecircumstances whose reasonable claims would not be met by the grant of UnemploymentInsurance.  A sub-committee was set up, under the  chairmanship of  Sir ClarendonHyde, to consider, this matter further and to confer with the Local Government Boardwith regard to it.  The Committee have received  a report  from Sir Clarendon Hyde,which is printed with the minutes of our seventh meeting, and the conclusions of whichwe have  adopted with some modifications.   We  accordingly recommend  (a) that  the-Civil Liabilities Committee should  be continued after the war in order that they may       [899-27]                                                        0
 give assistance to officers and men who are already receiving it  from that committee and to those who, although  they are not at present receiving it, could reasonably ask for assistance upon disbandment to meet their accruing liabilities;  (b) that arrange- ments should be made in accordance with which individuals.of all ranks who are not already in receipt of assistance from the Civil Liabilities Committee  should be able to make application for it some time before they leave the army, and that local enquiry into their  cases should be made through the local Naval and Military War Pensions Committee,  or  through a  sub-committee  of  that  body,  or the  County  Bench  of Magistrates sitting in private, if the applicants so prefer ; (c) that the Civil Liabilities Committee should  at once  proceed to  draw up  a  scheme for these purposes for the consideration of the  Treasury; and (d) that the scheme, when approved, should be notified to  officers and men through the War Office.     18.  We have also  considered the  question what  special arrangements will be necessary in connection with the resettlement of officers.  In this connection various points of  detail arise, particularly as  regards the  means by which  officers and  men belonging  to classes to which officers in  the  main belong may be enabled to receive further education and  training for civil occupations, where necessary, or may be assisted in obtaining suitable employment.  We  have thought it desirable to appoint a  small sub-committee, under the  chairmanship of Sir Reginald Brade, to consider these questions.   We have received an Interim Report from this Sub-Committee, which is printed  in Appendix  IV, and the conclusions of which we have adopted.   We there- fore recommend that an Appointments Board for  officers and  men of like standing (with the  necessary provincial organisation) should be established, under the control-of the Ministry of  Labour, to  co-operate with the existing  University Appointments Boards and other approved bodies, and that  the officials of the proposed Board should, so far as possible, be drawn  from among ex-officers.  We defer the consideration of educational and  other problems connected with this matter until  we have received the further report of the Sub-Committee.     19. The recommendations  contained  in  this report may  be summarised asfollows :      (a.)  Negotiations should be undertaken  at  the  earliest possible date  with the Allied and Neutral Governments  concerned  with  a  view to  obtaining port  and other facilities for demobilisation purposes.     (6 )  The legislation authorising the  payment  of  unemployment benefit should provide for a flat-rate of 10,9. a week as a minimum, with power to  the Ministry of Labour, on the recommendation of the proposed Central Demobilisation Committee, and with the consent of the Treasury, to increase the flat-rate if the circumstances should be deemed to make an increase necessary.     (c.)  The unemployment insurance policy should run from the end  of the month&apos;s furlough, during which  the soldier -will be in receipt of full pay and allowances.     (d.)  A statutory right  to  claim  priority of  employment  with their previous employers  should be conferred upon soldiers generally, subject to specified  conditions.     (c.)  Demobilisation  should  be  carried  out, subject  to military vexigencies in particular  cases, according  to  the requirements  of  trade  and  industry,  upon the following lines :      (1.)  Special arrangements should be made with the War Office by the Ministry of            Labour before the end of the war, if possible, for the release immediately            peace is assured of men specially required  in connection with  the work            of demobilisation.   It will also be necessary to include in the preliminary            stages men who undertake to continue their service after the war.     (2.)  The  subsequent general  order  of demobilisation should  be based on  the            principle of disbanding first men for whom employment has been ascertained            to be available through arrangements made by the War Office and Ministry of            Labour, or who belong to trades specified in a priority list drawn up with            reference  to the relative urgency of the  industrial  requirements of the            country.   Preference should be given in all classes,  so far as possible, to            married men.     (/.)  An inter-departmental committee  of  representatives  of the  War Office  and Ministry of Labour should sit during the period of  demobilisation in order to  settle revised instructions with  regard  to priority,  which  may  appear  to  be  rendered necessary on public grounds or by the state of employment in the different industries.     (g.)  The Civil Liabilities Committee  should. be  continued in  existence after  the war for the purpose  of granting  special assistance  to officers  and  men in like
circumstances whose  reasonable claims would  not be met  by the unemploymentinsurance.  That  Committee should prepare  as  soon  as possible  a scheme for  theconsideration  of the  Treasury, and  the arrangements, when approved, should benotified to officers and men through the War Office.    (h.) An Appointments  Board for officers  and  men of like  standing should heestablished  under  the control of the Ministry  of Labour  to  co-operate with  theexisting University Appointments Board and other approved bodies.  The officials ofthe proposed Board should, so far as possible, be drawn  from among ex-officers.                              &apos;   We have the honour to be,                                               Sir,..

I have signed the Report subject to the following reservation :     If the large sums due in respect of war gratuities, arrears of pay, &amp;c. (amounting,probably, to upwards of 100,000,0OOL), are paid in cash on demobilisation, a considerableproportion is likely to be immediately and unprofitably spent, to the serious aggravationof the general  economic situation, which  will in any case be one of  peculiar difficulty.The method of payment in three instalments during furlough proposed in paragraph 16does not appear to me to provide any safeguard against this danger; indeed, it  maywell conduce to thriftlessness more than one lump sum payment would.  The alternativewhich has been suggested  is to make payment  in all cases  through the medium of aspecial Savings Bank Account, which could  be. drawn upon at any Post Office, subjectto the ordinary Savings Bank rules.  This method of payment would  enable a man toconvert  his holding into cash  if he  so  desired, and it would not therefore disposeentirely of the economic difficulty ; but it would  at least give a lead in the directionof saving, it would be administratively simple, and, in the  interests  both of the menthemselves and of the general  community, it  appears  to me ,to deserve  furtherconsideration.

APPENDIX  I.MINUTES  OF MEETINGS.  Minutes of the Sixth Meeting, held at 11*30 A.M. on April 4, 1917.                           Present:The Right Hon. E. S. Montagu, M.P. (Chairman).Mr. B. P. Blackett, C.B., Treasury.Sir Reginald Brade, K.C.B., War Office.Mr. H. B.  Butler, Ministry of Labour.Sir Clarendon Hyde.Mr. C. F.  Rey, Ministry of Labour.    Mr. Vaughan Nash, C.V.O., C.B,    Mr. W. A. Colegate, Ministry of Labour,    Mr. A. R. McBain, War Office.   (In attendance.)Secretaries.    THE CHAIRMAN explained that since the last meeting the Interim Report of theSub-Committee had been adopted by the late  Government, and both the War Officeand  the  Ministry  of  Labour  had made great progress with the technical  side ofdemobilisation.  As neither Mr. Bellamy nor Mr. Young was present, he proposed at alater date to see them and find out how far they agreed  with  the  conclusions reachedby the Committee at this meeting,  ;    He proposed first  of all to deal with the question as to how far it is possible anddesirable to give priority of discharge to men of certain trades or professions.    MR. BUTLER said that  before it would  be possible to  work out a full  schemeof priority, the questions as  to the early release of (a) men  of certain trades andprofessions, [b) men for whom employers ask byname, and  (c) married men, wouldhave to be considered together.  If you decided to give priority to married  men andto men whose jobs  had  been  kept open  for them, that would cut across any schemefor giving priority  to certain trades.    THE CHAIRMAN  said  that it  might be decided first of all to give priority tocertain occupations, and then  that the married men within those occupations, or themen who had definite jobs,  should be  the first  in each occupational  group to bedemobilised.    MR. BUTLER thought that such a  sub-division of these groups would make itsomewhat difficult for the War Office to put the scheme into practice.    THE CHAIRMAN  felt that  classification by trades was the first essential of thescheme.    MR. BUTLER asked  whether all single  men in a reserved occupation would betaken before the married men in a non-reserved occupation.    SIR REGINALD BRADE explained that the  War Office had  only raised thequestion  of married men coming home first in order to avoid  continued payment ofseparation allowances as much as possible.  If demobilisation had to be started withouta preliminary period of preparation, such as might be had during an armistice of threemonths, it would be impossible to get complete information through employers as toindividuals whom they wanted at once.    SIR CLARENDON  HYDE  asked what was the  latest rate  of  demobilisationagreed upon by the War Office.    SIR REGINALD BRADE said that the utmost speed with  which men could bepassed  through the  dispersal stations  would be  at  the  rate  of  40,000  a  day:20,000 from France and 20,000 from the home forces.
    MR. REY thought  that the discharge of 40,000 men a day would be a terriblething, from an industrial point of view.   It would  he impossible  to absorb them atthat rate.    THE  CHAIRMAN  asked  whether,  supposing it were  desirable to slow downdemobilisation because of the state of industry, and  yet equally  desirable to get themen away  from France as quickly as possible, it would be possible to slacken the rateof actual discharge.    SIR R.  BRADE said that he was not in a position to answer that question.    THE  CHAIRMAN asked whether the task of the War Office would he made moredifficult by a policy of giving priority to married men or to men who had offers of workwithin each occupational group.    SIR REGINALD BRADE  thought it would not, provided there were  an  armistice.    MR. REY said that he feared that every trade would claim priority,  and it wouldhe extremely difficult to differentiate between various occupations.    SIR CLARENDON HYDE asked whether  it would be  possible for an employerto apply for a definite number of men for whom he could at once supply work.    MR. REY thought the Trade Unions would  raise objections to this.  The choiceof men must not be left solely to the employer.    MR. BLACKETT asked if it  would  he  possible to  indicate the proportion ofmen in various industries who would be required at the same time.    MR. BUTLER  said that it would not he possible.   They could indicate the tradeswhich should come first and those which  should come last quite easily, but the inter-mediate trades were too interdependent to  enable them to  indicate priority with anycertainty.    THE  CHAIRMAN  asked  whether it  would he  possible to vary the scheme ofpriority according to the requirements of  the market.    SIR REGINALD BRADE thought it would he quite  possible, provided sufficientnotice were given.    SIR  CLARENDON HYDE thought it would take about a year for  the munitionworks to revert to peace conditions, but arrears of orders might prove so  heavy that itwould be unnecessary for an employer to discharge his substitutes in order to makeroom  for  the returning soldiers.   He asked whether it was proposed to demobilisefighting men before such branches of the  forces as the Army Service Corps.    SIR REGINALD BRADE did not  think it would he practicable to make such adifference, though the scheme  which the War Office had  in preparation could, as ascheme, be applied to any part  of the military forces.    THE  CHAIRMAN  said that they must work on  the assumption that men  shouldhe returned  from France as quickly as  possible.  He suggested, and the Committeeagreed, that the Ministry of Labour should  prepare a priority list of occupations in theorder in which soldiers are to be discharged from the  Army.  It would be recognisedthat, except in broad outlines, this priority  list must be provisional ; it would  requireand should he capable of adjustment from time to time.    THE  CHAIRMAN  said that he felt  that the proposal  to  differentiate betweenmarried and single men would  be a difficult one.   You  would get all kinds of  claims.from such people as the only sons of widows.    SIR REGINALD BRADE said that the War Office would not press for the prior-return of married men.    The Committee agreed that, so far  as practicable, preference within the priorityclasses should be given to married men.                       tnen  turned to  the question  as  to  whether  units at homeshould  be allowed to discharge at a quicker rate than units in France.  He suggestedthat they  should - not settle the definite proportion  of foreign to home troops  in       [899-27]                                                        D
demobilisation,  but should merely indicate that in their opinion troops due for foreignreliefs  should be  brought  home first.   He  asked whether the War  Office  couldindicate the maximum rate at which men could be brought from France.    SIR REGINALD BRADE said that they were not in a position to do so exactly.The present estimate was 20,000 a day.  Sir Eric Geddes had made great improvementsin the facilities  for transport in France, and in due course the Admiralty or the Ministryof Shipping would be able to help towards a more definite estimate.    The Committee decided  that the proportion between the men on home service andthe men in France should he settled as soon as the rate at  which it would be possibleto transport men from France daily had been ascertained.   Due regard should be hadto the prime necessity of getting  men home from France as quickly as possible.    THE CHAIRMAN  next raised  the  point  as to whether  men who intended tostay on in the Army should be allowed to  come home first of all.   He felt  that theArmy of the future should be treated as  an occupation and should  be included in thepriority list.    SIR  REGINALD BRADE said that the War Office would place these men first ofall in order of priority if they were ascertained before the return commenced.  Untiltheir return it would be  impossible to release territorials and other troops at presentserving as  garrisons in  India  and elsewhere, but it was quite uncertain  at presentwhether the men  of  the future  army would  be forthcoming before demobilisationbegan.    The Committee decided that these men should be sent home as soon as possible.    THE CHAIRMAN asked what  was the view  of  the War Office  as  to the earlyrelease of officers in the Employment Department now serving.    SIR REGINALD BRADE said that the War  Office would release these men as60on as possible, and he  was further negotiating with the Home Office as .to the earlyrelease of policemen.    THE CHAIRMAN  called attention to the  question of the  early release of mencalled up from &quot; one man &quot; businesses.    MR. BUTLER said these men were included under Class 41 in the priority list.    MR. REY  said that he had supposed that the  local Committees would deal withcases of this kind.    SIR CLARENDON HYDE suggested  that information should  be obtained fromthe rate collectors as to the number of  shops which  had been  closed in any one largeborough.  The  Committee decided to postpone any recommendation on this point untilthis information had been obtained.    THE CHAIRMAN  drew  the  Committee&apos;s attention  to  the  correspondencerelating to the method of payment of gratuities.    SIR REGINALD  BRADE  said that in  the past the method  suggested  in thiscorrespondence had  been tried  for  the payment  of deferred  pay.   Payment  byinstalments had  also been  tried for the payment of gratuities and  balauces afterthe South African War.   In both cases  the War Office experience  had been that themen resented^ delays in receiving their money.   But that experience  could not be heldto be conclusive, and much would depend on the conditions obtaining on demobilisation.Though on this occasion men might be inclined to be more thriftily minded, yet pricesmay be so high and  obligations so pressing that they might be  actually in pressingneed of their money in cash.    THE CHAIRMAN  suggested that gratuities might  be paid  by  means  of warsavings certificates.    SIR CLARENDON  HYDE  said that a man should draw the bulk  of his-gratuitywhen he reached home and  not before.
    SIR CLARENDON HYDE felt that the Minister of Labour must he the ExecutiOfficer, and that the Committee should be purely an advisory one.    SIR REGINALD BRADE explained that  each man would only draw an advanceof 21. at the dispersal station.    THE CHAIRMAN pointed out that the Admiralty considered  it unwise to paygratuities in a lump sum.   He suggested that the  soldiers should  be given an optionas to the method of payment.    MR. BLACKETT thought  that the  War Savings Committees  might he  veryuseful in this connection.   The machinery  would have to he that of the Post Office.It was decided to leave this question for departmental discussion by the War Office.    THE CHAIRMAN said  that, as regards the scheme of special assistance to menwho would not feel their claims were met by the grant of free unemployment insurance,his own view was that there was  not very great force in the objections  of the LocalGovernment Board.  He thought  that the Civil  Liabilities Committee would be certainto take a very conservative view of their functions.    The Committee decided that Sir Clarendon Hyde, Mr. Blackett, and Mr. Butlershould see Mr. A. V. Symonds of  the  Local Government Board and discuss the matterlurther with him.    THE CHAIRMAN said  he thought the reply to the letter from the Admiraltyon  the demobilisation of  the  Navy should be  that it would he preferable to co-optrepresentatives  of the Admiralty in  order that the  same machinery might be  usedfor the demobilisation of sailors as for that of soldiers.    MR, BUTLER strongly  agreed.    It was agreed that a letter should he addressed to  the Admiralty suggesting thatthe Sub-Committee on Demobilisation might, with the necessary changes of personnel,he utilised for dealing with naval demobilisation.    THE CHAIRMAN said that, with  regard  to  free unemployment insurance, theCommittee would remember that  the rate of .10s. had been fixed partly   because thatwas the rate which the Board of Trade desired and partly because it fitted in with therate paid by Trade Unions.  The Reconstruction Committee were particularly anxiousthat the rate should be increased  because of the great rise in the cost of living.  Heunderstood that Trade Unions were considering  the  question of  raising their ownunemployment rates, and  that the &quot;ailway men proposed to make grants of 15s.    MR. REY said that the  difficulty was that at present  a returned soldier mightduring unemployment be  drawing three sums 7s.  contributory unemployment benefit,10s. free unemployment benefit, and 10s. from his Union.  The Ministry of Labour hadalready drafted  a  Bill to  give effect to this recommendation of the grant of 10s.  Itwas not proposed to pay the two sums simultaneously.     THE CHAIRMAN said he was only anxious, to guard against any final and definiterecommendation until they saw what the position of prices was likely to be.     It was decided to leave over  the question for further consideration.     THE CHAIRMAN asked whether the Committee had any observations to make onthe composition  of  the  Central.  Demobilisation  Committee.  He himself had notvisualised  a body of  quite  this size, hut he  presumed  that they would not  be anexecutive body.     MR. BUTLER said  it  was proposed that the  Central Committee  should  workthrough Sub-Committees. Their duties would  not be executive; they would be  thereto  advise the Minister.
                                  Conclusions.    1. The Ministry of Labour to be asked to  prepare a provisional list of industriesarranged according to their importance, with a  view to determining the order in whichsoldiers should be demobilised.  This list should be so drawn up so as to be capableof adjustment from  time to time in accordance with the conditions of industry.    2. So far as practicable, preference  to be  given within the priority classes tomarried men.    3. The proportion between men on home service and men in France, who will bedemobilised  simultaneously, to &quot;be  setiled  so  soon  as the  maximum  daily  rate oftransport of men from France has been ascertained.  Due regard ^ to be had to theprime necessity of getting men home from France as quickly as possible.    4. The War Office to  arrange for the  earliest possible  release of  all men whointend to remain in the Army after the war, in  order to make possible the return oftroops  temporarily serving as garrisons in India and elsewhere.    5. The  War Office to  arrange for  the release of  officers of the  EmploymentExchanges now  on  active service, and of any classes similarly wanted for analogousreasons, at the earliest possible moment permitted by hostilities.    6. The question of the rate  of free unemployment benefit to be left  open forreadjustment in accordance with the state of prices. Minutes of the Seventh Meeting, held at 3*30 P.M. on Jane 28, 1917.                           Present:Sir Clarendon Hyde (in the Chair).Mr. A.

SIR CLARENDON HYDE explained that Mr. Montagu was unable to be present,and had asked him to take the Chair.  He was sorry to say that Mr. Vaughan Nash,owing to pressure of other work, found himself unable  to continue as their Secretary,but he welcomed Mr.  Qpcott in his place.   He outlined  the  result  of  the conferencewith Mr. Symonds, of the Local  Government Board,  with  regard  to  the specialassistance to be given to  officers and men  in like circumstances  whose reasonableclaims would not in practice be met by the grant of free unemployment insurance.    SIR REGINALD BRADE said that the Civil Liabilities Committee had not beenvery generous in their awards.    SIR  CLARENDON  HYDE said that  Mr.  Symonds  had told  them  that  theCommittee had become much more generous recently.    SIR R. BRADE said that he had had prepared  a note on  the  German proposalsfor dealing with this problem.    GENERAL  BURNETT-HITCHCOCK  explained  that   the  German, schemewas already working.  It was  a  State  scheme  and much more  decentralisedthan that adopted in England.  Imperial assistance was given in certain  cases to  theStates.    MR.  BELLAMY  thought that  it would  be unwise  to eliminate the possibility ofobtaining loans from the Committee.  Such assistance would undoubtedly be needed.
He asked why the continuance of the Committee&apos;s activities was  limited to six monthsafter the war.    SIR  CLARENDON HYDE said it was necessary to have  some limit to  them.The Committee were not bound to that particular one.    SIR  REGINALD BRADE asked whether the  Civil Liabilities Committee onlygave assistance to officers.    MR.  COLEGATE said that men could  apply on exactly the same  terms, exceptthat in their case no allowance was made for children.    SIR  CLARENDON HYDE said that he had been greatly relieved by the resultcf the enquiry into &quot; One man&quot; businesses, since it showed that  the problem was avery limited one.    MR.  BELLAMY did not think that the test had been wide enough.  He suggestedtaking a test in the north of England, say in Manchester, Liverpool, and  some town inthe West Riding of Yorkshire.    SIR  CLARENDON HYDE agreed that this should be  done.    GENERAL BURNETT-HITCHCOCK  suggested that  the  period  during  whichapplication for  assistance might  be  made should be  six months  after  the  manspersonal demobilisation.    MR,  BELLAMY  said that he preferred that the tribunal before whom cases wouldhe assessed should he the  local Naval and Military Pensions Committee, rather than theBench of Magistrates.    SIR  CLARENDON  HYDE  said  that the difficulty about using the  PensionsCommittee was that they only sat in the county towns, and a man would often haveto go a long way to have  his case heard.  He proposed that  the tribunal should bethe Local Pensions Committee, or a Sub-Committee thereof.    SIR  REGINALD BRADE said  that it would  be best if  the War  Office gavenotification of the right to apply for such assistance.    MR  LEITH ROSS asked whether the gratuity granted to officers would not coverall their requirements.    GENERAL BURNETT-HITCHCOCK said that the  gratuity would  certainlyhave to be taken into  account.    The Committee accepted the conclusions set out in the  Report of the Conferencewith the following modifications : -    1. That it should be possible for application to be made for assistance to  the Civil           Liabilities Committee up to a period of six months  after the man&apos;s personal           demobilisation.    2. That local enquiry into individual  cases should he made through the local           Naval and Military Pensions Committee  or through a Sub-Committee of           that body, or possibly the County Bench of Magistrates sitting in private,           if the applicant so prefers.    3. That the scheme should he notified to officers and men through the War  Office.    4. That the question  of the grant of loans should be deferred for the collection of.           further information.    SIR  CLARENDON HYDE drew the attention of the Committee to the questionof a priority list of trades.    MR.  BUTLER  felt that any list drawn up now would he of so  provisional a.character as  not to be worth very much.  His own opinion was  that  the best coursewould  be to find  out now what was  the best means of collecting the data on whichsuch a list should be based, and to defer the preparation of the list until nearer the endof the  war.  If it were  possible  to put into  operation  the proposed scheme forascertaining  what jobs were being kept open for individuals, that would largely solvethe question  of priority.   . SIR  CLARENDON  HYDE asked  whether the Ministry  of Labour  did  notanticipate that a great number of men would not apply to the exchanges at all.     . [899-27]                                                       E
     MR. BUTLER said that a mans job would not always be available at the moment he returns home.   It was very important  that the Ministry of Labour should  have a month or six weeks in which to get  their scheme into working order.     SIR CLARENDON HYDE thought  that firms  would have plenty of orders on their books at the end of the war, but would suffer from lack of material.  The  crucial point would be the amount of shipping available.     MR, YOUNG agreed.   He felt that the problem would depend  very largely on the Governments decision as to the transference of civil war-workers.     SIR CLARENDON HYDE thought  that the engineering and the iron  and steel trades would have plenty of material, also that railwaymen, miners, and agriculturalists could be absorbed  very quickly. The real  trouble  would  come  in  trades like the textile trade.     SIR REGINALD BRADE explained  that  the War Office had almost  complete control over certain textile raw materials, such as wool and  flax, and that  at the end of the war they would have large stocks on their  hands.  He agreed that the  shipping problem would be the most vital one.     GENERAL BURNETT-HITCHCOCK said  that the rate of demobilisation might have to depend also  on the  amount of food available.  It was a  comparatively easy matter now,  when men were concentrated in large numbers, but if  100,000 men were suddenly added to the population of Manchester he was not certain whether they could be fed.     SIR REGINALD BRADE asked whether  the Ministry of Labour would  watch this point.   -  MR. BUTLER  thought  it should rather be a matter for an Inter-departmental Committee.   He asked whether the War Office had made arrangements for the early release of employment exchange officers and other officials.    SIR REGINALD BRADE said that they had worked out a scheme for this.    GENERAL BURNETT-HITCHCOCK said that, if necessary, they could  obtain the return of  500,000 &quot; pivotal &quot; men who were asked for by name.    MR. BUTLER  asked whether the Ministry  of Labour  would be  able to choose these men.    SIR REGINALD BRADE thought it should be their work.    MR. REY felt that this individual priority list should be kept as small as possible.    GENERAL BURNETT-HITCHCOCK  said that he uuderstood it  would bepossible for the railways  to absorb 140,000 men very quickly.    SIR CLAREXDON HYDE  said that  depended on the  amount of rolling stockwhich was returned from France.    The Committee agreed  that  the Ministry of  Labour should obtain data for  ascer-taining the priority list at the end of  the war  rather than draw up a priority list now;special arrangements  to be  made  by  the Ministry  of  Labour for  the  individual demobilisation,  under the orders of the War Office, in the first place of  &quot;pivotal&quot;men  engaged in industries; and, in the second  place, of men engaged in the mostimportant public utility services.    SIR  CLARENDON HYDE  asked  the  Committee  to  consider Sir  R.  Brade&apos;s Minute of  the 24th April, the Ministry of Labour&apos;s Minute of  the 21st May, and  Sir R.Brade&apos;s reply thereto, on the subject of the rate of demobilisation.    MR. BUTLER agreed that the  rate should  be as rapid as possible for  politicalTeasons.  His only fear  was that if. the rate  approached  40,000  a day, the labour market might not be able to absorb  men in such numbers.   He drew the attention ofthe Committee to the fact that  Professor Chapman thought it quite  impossible at themoment to forecast the rate at which  the labour market could  absorb men.   Professor Chapman&apos;s estimate was that 1,200,000 had been  given promise of reinstatement, but it did not follow that their jobs would be immediately available for them.    MR. YOUNG had great sympathy with the doubts of the Ministry of Labour.  He asked on what Professor OhapmaiYs  figures, as to one-third  of the  men in the  Army
having their jobs reserved for them, were based; he very much doubted if this wereso in reality.    MR.  COLEGATE explained that, the figures were based on the  answers to  aspecial question added to the Z 8 Reports.    GENERAL BURNETT-HITCHCOCK said that the War Office for their purposesmust know both ends of the priority problem, i.e., which men must he brought homefirst, and  which would be kept to the last.    MR.  BELLAMY was in favour of extending the period of furlough.    GENERAL BURNETT-HITCHCOCK  thought unemployment insurance was  abetter method of dealing with this.    SIR  CLARENDON. HYDE felt that it was essential to increase the amount ofbenefit to be paid to demobilised soldiers.    GENERAL BURNETT-HITCHCOCK  thought  it would  be  a  very  expensivebusiness to  prolong the period of furlough,  because both employed and unemployedwould  benefit equally from it. Owing to the  different rates of pay obtaining in  theArmy, it would also perpetuate great unfairness.    MR.  BUTLER said that  the Ministry of Labour recognised ^ the  difficulty ofcontinuing army pay beyond the month&apos;s  furlough on administrative grounds,  andthought that a flat rate would be easier to administer and on the whole more equitable,though it did not enable the man with children to get  more assistance than a singleman.   He therefore suggested that a possible solution might he that in the Bill whichthe Ministry of Labour proposed to introduce, they should make the minimum  benefit10s., and  take powers to increase such benefit up to a maximum of  1Z. on the advice ofthe Central  Demobilisation Committee, and with the consent of the  Treasury.    MR.  REY quite agreed, and pointed out that the rate payable  at any  particularperiod must be a flat rate.    MR.  BELLAMY thought it would be very difficult to have a  sliding scale.  Hewas anxious that the maximum should not he fixed at 1Z.    SIR  CLARENDON HYDE asked what maximum Mr. Bellamy would propose ?    MR,  BELLAMY  suggested that 30s. should be the maximum.    MR.  LEITH ROSS thought that was too high; the maximum always tended to bethe actual rate of payment.  He asked whether  it would  not  form a precedent  forraising the rate of benefit for other classes of insured workers ?    MR.  BELLAMY said  that he thought that there was no parallel between the casesof the soldier and the civil  worker.    After further discussion  the Committee  agreed  that  the proposed legislationauthorising  the payment of  unemployment  benefit should provide for a flat  rate of10s. as a minimum, with power to the Ministry of Labour to increase the flat  rate upto a maximum of 30s.; on  the advice of  the Central Demobilisation Committee  andwith the consent of the Treasury, if the circumstances should be deemed to make anincrease necessary.  The  Committee considered  that  a month&apos;s  furlough only  wasdesirable.    SIR  CLARENDON  HYDE  asked what progress had  been made with  theappointment of the Central Demobilisation Committee.    MR.  REY said that the Ministry of Labours Minute had been  in the hands of  theWar Cabinet about three and a-half months,  but that no decision had been reached.    The Committee expressed the opinion  that the War Cabinet should  be urged togive an early decision.    MR,  BELLAMY raised the question of  the early release of men  who joined  theArmy in the first stages of  the war.    SIR  REGINALD BRADE said that the War Office would prefer that this shouldnot be made a principle.
                                  Conclusions.    1. The Committee accepted, with the following modifications, the conclusions setout in the Report of the Conference with Mr. Symonds of the Local Government  Board(see Appendix):     (1.) That it should be possible  for  application  to  be made for assistance to the           Civil Liabilities Committee up to  a period  of six months after the man&apos;s           personal demobilisation.    (2.) That local enquiry into  individual  cases  should be made through the local           Naval and Military Pensions Committee or through a Sub-Committee of that           body, or possibly the County Bench of Magistrates sitting in private, if the           applicant so prefers.    (3.) That the scheme should  be notified to officers  and men  through the War           Office.    (4.) That the question of the grant of loans should be deferred for the collection           of further information.    2. The Committee agreed that the  Ministry of  Labour  should obtain data forascertaining the  priority list at the end  of the war, rather than draw up a priority listnow ; special arrangements to  be  made by the Ministry of Labour for the  individualdemobilisation, under the orders  of the  War  Office in  the first place, of &quot; pivotal&quot;men engaged in industries, and, in  the second place, of men engaged in  the mostimportant public utility services.    3. The Committee agreed that the proposed legislation authorising the paymentof  unemployment benefit should  provide for a flat rate of 10s. as a minimum, withpower to the Ministry of  Labour to increase the flat rate  up to a maximum of 30s., onthe advice of the Central Demobilisation Committee and with the consent of theTreasury, if the circumstances  should be. deemed to  make an increase necessary.  TheSub-Committee considered that a montb/s furloixgh only was desirable.    GENERAL  BURNETT-HITCHCOCK  said  that as  a  matter  of  fact  theCommanding Officer would select married men and the soldiers within  any occupationgroup who had served longest.    SIR CLARENDON  HYDE  asked the Committee to consider the question of thedemobilisation of the professional classes.    MR, REY  explained  the  origin and growth  of the professional  and businessregister.   About 1,200 to 1,400 men had been placed in employment  It was proposedto add to the register a panel of business men who might give advice and assistance toapplicants.  They had had meetings with the University  Appointments Board, whohad agreed to join in any scheme formulated.    SIR CLARENDON  HYDE  thought that the real  problem was  one of givingmonetary assistance.    MR, COLEGATE said that there  were  two sides to the question : (1) assistanceto men in getting into touch with the right jobs;  and (2) assistance  in obtainingtraining.    SIR CLARENDON HYDE explained that Mr. Montagus  idea was that a Sub-Committee be appointed to consider this special point.    The Committee  agreed to set up a Sub-Committee which it was suggested shouldbe composed as follows :        -  Sir R. Brade (Chairman).         Brigadier-General. Burnett-Hitchcock, War Office.         Sir A. Goodson.         Lieutenant-Colonel Sir A. Leetham,  War Office.         Mr. H.  E. Morgan, Ministry of Labour.         Mr. J.  S. Nicholson,  Employment  Sub-Committee of  Ministry of Pensions             Committee,    It was decided to hold another meeting of the Committee on the following day.
Appendix to Minutes of Seventh Meeting.     ASSISTANCE TO BE GIVEN TO OFFICERS AND  MEN IN LIKE CIRCUMSTANCES.Report of Sir Clarendon Hyde&apos;s Conference with Mr. Symonds, of the Local Government                                     Board.    IN accordance with the decision of the  Army Demobilisation Sub-Committeeheld on Wednesday, the 4th April, a meeting was held  on  Tuesday, the 17th April,between                  Sir Clarendon Hyde;                 Mr. Blackett, C.B. ;                 Mr. Butler;                 Mr. Symonds, C.B., of the Local Government Board ; and                 Mr. Colegate ;in order to discuss  the objections put forward by Mr.  Symonds to the scheme proposedfor giving special assistance to junior officers and men in  &quot; like circumstances&quot; whosereasonable claims  would not  in  practice be  met  by the  grant of free UnemploymentInsurance.    Sir Clarendon Hyde explained  to  Mr. Symonds the purpose of the meeting, andasked him to give some explanation  of  the working of the  present  scheme of thefinancial assistance given by the Military Service (Civil Liabilities) Committee.    Mr. Syrnonds briefly explained the work done  at present, in the course of which itappeared that the  present  assistance  was  only given in respect  of certain specificliabilities, namely :     (a.) Rent.    (b.) Interest and instalments payable in respect of loans, including mortgages.    (c.) Instalments payable under agreements for the purchase of business premises,          a dwelling-house, furniture, and the like.    (d.) Taxes.    (e.) Rates.    (/.) Insurance premiums.    (g.) School fees.and in the-case of  officers only     (h.) Maintenance of children, 201. per annum  each child.    Mr. Symonds  then  explained the  reasons that he had already given for thinkingthe scheme circulated to the Reconstruction Committee unnecessary.    After discussion it was agreed  by those present that  the assistance given  toofficers and men in &quot; like circumstances,&quot; whose reasonable claims would not in practicehe  met by the grant of free Unemployment Insurance, should not provide for thegranting of  loans  to applicants.   Such loans would probably, in a very large numberof cases, not be put to a good use by the recipient, and supervision as to the method  ofexpenditure and machinery for repayment would be difficult and costly.  Moreover, ifan applicant required to set up or restart a small shop, for example, hie could get themain items of the expenditure for which he required  the  loan  covered by grants  fromthe  Civil Liabilities  Committee in respect of accruing liability  for rent, interest,instalments, &amp;c.  If with assistance under these headings he was still unable to  starthis enterprise, he would not appear to he a  suitable case  for assistance from the  CivilLiabilities  Committee.  In any  case  it was agreed  that the  assistance  to he given.       [899-27]                                                         F    4.  The  Committee agreed  to  set up  a Sub-Committee, which it  was suggestedshould  he composed as follows:-        Sir R. Brade (Chairman).        Brigadier-G-eneral Burnett-Hitchcock, War Office.        Sir A. Goodson.                      &apos;        Lieutenant-Colonel Sir A.  Leetham, War Office.        Mr. H. E. Morgan, Ministry of Labour.        Mr. J. S. Nicholson,  Employment Sub-Committee of  Ministry of  Pensions             Committee.
 should  not be regarded  as an alternative  to  Unemployment Insurance,  which was intended  to meet a  specific  evil  likely to  arise  out of the  dislocation  caused by demobilisation.   The special  assistance  required by officers ^ and  men &quot; in like circumstances &quot; would be in the nature of help in meeting certain accruing liabilities which it would be difficult for them to. face immediately upon disbandment.  It would be inadvisable to have anything  in  the  nature of two  schemes of  Unemployment Insurance, one  at a  much higher rate than the  other,  based on  the fact that the recipient  came from  a different class.  The  men who might  be  expected to  require special assistance could be divided  into two classes :      (a.;  Those men who  are  already receiving  assistance from the Civil Liabilities           Committee; and     (b.)  Those who, although they  were not  at  present receiving assistance from the           Civil Liabilities Committee, could  reasonably  ask for  assistance  upon           disbandment to meet their accruing liabilities.     With regard to the first class, in answer to questions,  Mr. Symonds agreed thatthe  Civil Liabilities Committee might continue its assistance in cases where it wasproved to be necessary for  six months after the man&apos;s return from the war     In view of these  facts, it  appears  that  the  best  method  of giving such  specialassistance as may be required would be to continue the Civil  Liabilities Committee forsome lime after the war in  order that they might give  assistance  to  both  the  above-mentioned classes in  respect  of  the specific liabilities  enumerated  above.   Thosealready in receipt of  assistance would merely make application for extension of  theiralready existing  grants  for whatever  period  they considered necessary; probablya maximum of six months  after the return of the individual after the war  should beimposed.     With regard to  the second  class, arrangements  should be made in  accordancewith which they could make application for assistance in meeting the specific liabilitiesalready set out some time before they  left the army, although, no doubt, a great manyof them would not be  in  a position to make the full application until their returnhome.  These cases would, of course,  require careful investigation  on the lines ofthe investigations  at  present  carried out by or  on  behalf of the  Civil   LiabilitiesCommittee.  They must, however,  be promptly dealt with, and in cases where  it isnot  possible to deal with them  within one  month  of  the  man&apos;s disbandment  apreliminary grant should be made.     Mr.  Symonds stated   that he  thought the method of  investigation  at presentadopted a little expensive,  and accordingly it would  seem  desirable to ask the  CivilLiabilities Committee to submit a scheme on the above lines  to  the ReconstructionCommittee for their consideration.   It appears that it  is  not the  general  practice tomake local enquiries before grants are made.  There are  obvious  drawbacks to  suchenquiries.  It  would  seem, however,  that  some use could properly  be made  of theLocal Naval and  Military Pensions  Committee,  or possibly  the county  bench ofmagistrates sitting in private.
 Minutes of the Eighth Meeting held at 2*30 P.M. on June 29, 1917.                           Present:The Eight Hon. E. S.  Montagu, M.P. (Chairman).Mr. A. Bellamy.Sir Reginald Brade, K.C.B., War Office.Brigadier-General B. F. Burnett-Hitchcock, D.S.O., War Office.Mr. H. B. Butler, Ministry of Labour.Mr. E, J. Cheney, C.B., Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.Mr. C. F. Rey, Ministry of Labour.Mr. F. W. Leith Ross, Treasury.Lieutenant-Colonel E. D.  SAvinton, C.B., D.S.O., Committee of Imperial    Defence.Mr. R Young.               Mr. G. C. Upcott,   ) w               n,r  TIT A ri i   x.  [Secretaries.               Mr. W. A. Colegate, \    THE CHAIRMAN asked whether the Committee had found it  essential to makethe increased rate of unemployment  benefit a flat rate.   He  pointed out  that  30s:, ifthat rate were reached, would be higher than the minimum wage which it was proposedto guarantee to agricultural labourers.   He was afraid that under such conditions veryfew agricultural labourers would be inclined to  make an early return  to their work.    MR. BELLAMY replied that benefit would only be obtainable  on the prescribedconditions, namely that no suitable employment were available.    MR. REY said that there would be serious administrative difficulties in the wayof paying benefit otherwise than at a flat rate.    MR. LEITLT ROSS said  that  if  the rate were raised to  30s.  there might bedifficulty in trades where half-time was worked.    MR. BELLAMY did not think  so.   If half-time meant working two or three daysa week, a man would be only entitled to a proportion of his benefit.    MR. REY agreed.   Unemployment insurance was paid at so much a day.    THE CHAIRMAN thought it might be as well to  include a representative of theArtists Officers Training Corps on their special Sub-Committee which was to deal withthe question of the discharged officers and men  of professional classes    The Committee agreed.    THE CHAIRMAN asked whether the War Office were doing anything to meet thecase of doctors.    SIR R. BRADE  explained that the War Office were making arrangements  bywhich professional men  and  men  in  certain  public services, should be demobilisedearlier.  Amongst these men would be the panel doctors.    THE CHAIRMAN invited the Committee to discuss the recommendations of theWar Office Demobilisation Committee.    SIR R. BRADE explained that as regards  the alternative methods (a) and (b),the War Office had now decided to  adopt method (o)  in  any  case.  They  had alsodecided  to  do  away with  the  special  dispersal stations  proposed  for  certain corps(paragraph  4, Part II of War Office Report), for instance, the Engineers, Royal Flyino-Corps. &amp;c.  Every man would go to  the dispersal station nearest his own home    GENERAL  BURNETT-HITCHCOCK said  that  some of the  dispersal stationswere not very suitable,  and he proposed to examine them all with a view to revision.    THE CHAIRMAN asked  whether any  plan for the  return  of the Dominioncontingents (paragraph 9, Part I of War Office Report)  had been decided upon.
     SIR R.  BRADE said that that question had been settled.     THE  CHAIRMAN  stated  that  as  regards the  interpretation  of  the words&quot;duration of war,&quot;  a committee of lawyers was to be set up first of all to deal withthe legal side of the question.  When they had  reported it was  proposed to have alay committee representing parties interested to see how far the legal  interpretationwould meet the actual circumstances.     SIR R.  BRADE said that in the meanwhile the various Departments of  the WarOffice were making a statement of  their own requirements in this matter.     THE CHAIRMAN explained to the Sub-Committee that steps were being takento deal with the question of the disposal of Government stores.   He asked  whetherthe War Office had discussed with the French the question of port facilities.     SIR li.  BRADE said that they had not yet done  so, but there had  been somepreliminary communication with the Belgian Government.     GENERAL  BURNETT-HITCHCOCK  said that port  facilities  governed thewhole problem.     THE CHAIRMAN asked whether the War Office proposed to collect the necessaryinformation  as  to the trades of men through the regimental officers  or  through aspecial corps appointed for the purpose.     GENERAL  BURNETT-HITCHCOCK said it   was  being  done  by the regi-mental  officers.   The Deputy Adjutant-General  at the  Base  would  require  someadditional staff for sifting the  information.     MR. REY feared that with  regard to the registration of men on Form (A) theindustrial information so collected might not be altogether accurate.     GENERAL  BURNETT-HITCHCOCK said  that the War Office were  preparedto embody in instructions any regulations which the Ministry of  Labour rniodit propose.He did  not think there would be any difficulty in the registration  of &quot;pivotal&quot; men,but he was very doubtful as to the practicability of obtaining returns on  Form (A), asproposed by the Ministry of Labour.     THE CHAIRMAN  said that  Form (A) was essential to their scheme.     MR. REY agreed.   The  communication  which  they proposed  to address toemployers presupposed that Form (A) would be supplied.     THE CHAIRMAN said that at a previous meeting the Committee chad agreed todemobilise the &quot; pivotal&quot; men first  of all, and after them other men  who were asked forby name by their  employers as a result of the issue of Form (A).     MR. BUTLER asked how long it would take the Army  authorities to procure theinformation to be  given on Form (A).     SIR R. BRADE said it would  take six weeks to complete the registration onForm (A) of the soldiers in France.     THE CHAIRMAN  said  that  the  difficulty  would  be  that in many cases theMinistry of Labour might only receive the forms after the return of the particular menconcerned.  He asked whether, supposing it were  possible to get  Form (A)  filled upbefore the end of  the war, the only difficulty would be one of finding individual men.     GENERAL  BURNETT-HITCHCOCK explained that if the forms  were  filled upsome time before the end of the war, men to whom those forms referred might have beenmovedto a totally different  part  of the field of operations, and it would  be almostimpossible to trace, them.     MR. YOUNG  said that  it was  absolutely essential that the Ministry  of Ltbourshould know which employers  were ready to take back their men at  once.     THE CHAIRMAN asked  whether it  would not  be possible  to have Form (A)filled in, say in October next;  the Ministry of  Labour would then have completeparticulars as to the number of men who had been promised jobs.   If the war continuedfor some time longer, would it not be possible to  have Form (A) filled up  once  more soas to trace the actual position  of the men to whom the forms referred ? &quot;
21306    GENERAL BURNETT-HITCHCOCK said there would be no trouble in gettingForm (A) filled up now, if the General Staff would allow it.    SIR R. BRADE  said  that the  feeling  of the General Staff was that if theyallowed these forms to be filled up now an impression might reach the enemy and theAllies that this country was contemplating an early peace.    MR. BUTLER said  that if the forms were filled up any considerable time  beforethe end of the war it might be necessary to do the work all over again.    MR. BELLAMY  said that if it would take three weeks to get home the &quot; pivotal&quot;men, then the delay in having full information available as to the  men subsequentlydemobilised would only be serious in the case of a small number  of  men who followedimmediately after the &quot; pivotal &quot; men.     MR. REY  agreed.    GENERAL BURNETT-HITCHCOCK  said that he would  try  to  explain theposition.  On the first day of demobilisation there would be approximately 100,000 menon leave from abroad who  would go straight  to the dispersal  stations.  Next wouldcome the &quot;pivotal&quot; men specially asked for,  including those who were the &quot;pivotal&quot;men wanted by  the War  Office  and  the Employment  Department  to  carry outdemobilisation.   Next would come  those men who had enlisted for further service inthe army, and he thought that one  advantage to  be offered to such men would  beearly furlough.   After them would come the bulk of the men who were not required forthe cadres.   Finally would  come the cadres  themselves.  Simultaneously  units wouldalso be brought  home for  reconstruction so as  to provide reliefs  for overseas garrisons,who would all be due for demobilisation.    MR. BUTLER said  that, as he understood it, the men on leave could be disposedof in about three days.  Next would come the &quot; pivotal &quot; men, and after them the menfor the new army.  Those  three groups  might take from thirty-six to forty days todemobilise, and that amount, of time would enable the Ministry of Labour to deal withmost of the (A)  forms.    THE CHAIRMAN summed  up the position by saying that, so far as the WarOffice report was concerned, he  understood  that the  Ministry of Labour was anxiousto receive Form  (A) as soon as possible.   It  would take only  three weeks to fill up.It was  necessary therefore  that  the Ministry  of Labour should reduce the period ofthree months which they had stated would be required  for dealing with  Form (A) fromtheir point of view.    MR. COLEGATE said that he  understood at  the meetings which fad been heldat the War Office that a &quot; tear-off&quot;  slip attached to Form (A) would be returned by thecommanding officers  to the Ministry of Labour, stamped  with a rubber scamp to showto which particular military unit the men belonged.    GENERAL BURNETT-HITCHCOCK  said it  ws essential to his scheme thatall these &quot;tear-off&quot; slips should go from the.Ministry of Labour to  the troops throughhis own directorate.  The position had somewhat changed since the  agreement referredto^ by  Mr.  Colegate had  been  arrived  at.   His  own directorate was  not then  inexistence.    MR. BUTLER asked who would decide whether the demands made for &quot; pivotal&quot;men by any special firm or department were too large.    THE CHAIRMAN  said  that  the  demands  would have to be sifted by theproposed Inter-departmental Committee.    MR. COLEGATE said that  a  great many  firms  would  want  their  foreignagents  first of all.    THE CHAIRMAN said that  the question of shipping requirements would needmuch closer investigation.    MR. BELLAMY  raised the question of prisoners of war.    SIR R. BRADE  said  the War  Office  would from time to time propose schemeafor dealing  with special classes, such as prisoners of  war, hospital units, women inJb ranee, &amp;c.       [899-27]                                                        Q
     THE  CHAIRMAN  asked  what  the  Committee  proposed  to do  about  thepublicity suggested by the War  Office.  He felt that there was the same reason tobe urged against publicity at the  present moment as the General  Staff had  urgedagainst the immediate filling up of Form (A).     SIR R.  BRADE thought that there  would  be no harm in  publishing certaingeneral principles new.     THE CHAIRMAN thought it might  be as well to wait a little.  Before the nextmeeting  he proposed that a further draft report  should  be  prepared which shouldembody any observations which the Committee  desired to make on  the War  Officereport.  He  suggested  that  the  Committee would  wish  to  express their strongappreciation  of the  work which  had  been  so  admirably  done  by  the  War  OfficeDemobilisation Committee.     The Committee entirely concurred in the  suggestion of  the Chairman.                                   Conclusions.     1. The  Committee agreed  that  a  representative of the  Artists Officers TrainingCorps should be added  to the Special Sub-Committee to deal with the question ofdischarged officers and men of the professional classes.     2. The Committee accepted generally the recommendations of  the Interim Reportof the War Office Demobilisation Committee.     3. The  Committee  decided  to postpone,  the  consideration  of  various  pointsconcerned with the order of demobilisation until  after the circulation of the report ofthe Ministry of Labour Demobilisation Committee.  Minutes of the Ninth Meeting, held at 2&apos;30 P.M. on July 17, 1917.                            Present:The Right Hon. E. S. Montagu, M.P. (Chairman).Mr. A. Bellamy.Sir Reginald Brade, K.C.B., War Office.Brigadier-General B. F. Burnett-Hitchcock, D.S.O.,  War Office.Mr. H. B. Butler, Ministry of Labour.Mr. Guy Calthrop.Mr. E. I. Cheney, C.B., Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.The Right Hon. Sir W. J. Goulding, Bart.Sir Clarendon Hyde.Captain Clement Jones, Committee of Imperial Defence.Mr. C. F. Rey,  Ministry of Labour.Mr. F. W. Leith Ross, Treasury.Mr. R. Young.             Mr. G. C. Upcott,   1  c             Mr. W. A.  delegate, \ Secretaries.    THE CHAIRMAN said that the outstanding event  which had  occurred  sincetheir last meeting had been the receipt of a report of the Departmental Committee ofthe Ministry of Labour  on demobilisation procedure.   He himself had circulated aI! emorandum suggesting some modification of the proposed use of Form (A) (p.  12,Ministry of Labour Report), and he need only add one consideration.  He felt that ifForm (A) remained in its present shape a man might write, according to instructions,opposite  to Question  13 the  words &quot;no assistance required,&quot; and by  so doing mightjeopardise his chances of an early discharge.    MR.  BUTLER  thought that  Form (A) should be amended by leaving out thewords interposed alter Question 4.
    THE CHAIRMAN  asked General  Burnett-Hitch cock to give his opinion onForm (A).    GENERAL BURNETT-HITCHCOCK thought that 80  per cent, of the repliesfurnished on Form (A) would be of value.  The men, knowing how much depended onthis form, would be anxious  to  fill it  in right, and  the  officers would be equally keen.He was afraid that the &quot; one man &quot; business man would  be at a great disadvantage ifthe words interposed after Question 4  were not omitted.    MR. REY  said that if a man.said that he required  no assistance, he would eitherbe sent back early as coming under Group 41, or  he would  receive no priority at all;he was therefore in favour of cutting out the words interposed after Question 4, with aview to having the form filled in by everybody.    MR. BUTLER stated that the Employment Exchanges would  be able  to  verifystatements made by &quot; one man&quot; business men.    MR. BELLAMY felt that the intelligence  of such men could he trusted in thefilling up of such forms.    MR. REY  agreed.    SIR CLARENDON  HYDE asked how such a man would fill up Questions 5-13.    MR. REY  said that he would not fill up Questions 5-12, but under  13  wouldenter &quot; own business.&quot;    THE CHAIRMAN thought  that two distinct schemes were before  the Com-mittee:             1. Demobilisation of the army by trade groups.            2. Demobilisation by individuals.    Form (A) was designed as a part  of the latter scheme.  The War Office method.was largely based on the former.    GENERAL BURNETT-HITCHCOCK agreed.  He felt that Form  (A) brokeup the priority of trades because it  applied  to  everybody.   His own solution wouldbe to increase the number of &quot; pivotal &quot; men and then rely on trade priority rather than onindividual priority.    THE CHAIRMAN suggested that  it might  be decided, to use the group systemfor certain trades, and to rely on Form (A) for &quot; pivotal&quot; and all other men.    GENERAL BURNETT-HITCHCOCK  thought that a  simpler  form would beneeded in the case of &quot; pivotal&quot; men.    THE CHAIRMAN asked whether Form (A) would be practicable or necessary inthe case of men to  be  employed in agriculture, mines, railways, dockyards, and otherindustries in which men could be immediately absorbed.    MR. BUTLER thought that in such cases Form (A) would be both practicableand desirable.    MR. REY  said that Form (A) gave a man&apos;s own statement of fact, and only bythat  means would  it be possible to know whether a man could be absorbed at onceor not.    THE CHAIRMAN  asked Mr.  Calthrop  whether  it  was not  a  fact  tha,t allrailwaymen and miners could be absorbed  at once.    MR. CALTHROP said that there might be some difficulty in the case of miners,because the  colliery districts of Fife, Northumberland, and  the anthracite district ofWales might not be able to commence  export immediately on the conclusion  of peace,owing to the depletion of shipping by submarine activity,  even though Scandinavia,Holland, and  Spam  were very short of  coal.   All rail way men  could  be absorbedat once.   m GENERAL BURNETT-H ITCH COCK  thought that if  Form (A) were used atall it must be used for  everyone.    MR. YOUNG asked why everv man who returned  from the front should not begiven priority of employment by legislative  action.   He  felt  it  should  be  the  firstduty of the  employer  to get rid of  a man who had entered his employment during
the war  and replace him  by an ex-soldier who had  been Jin his  employment  beforethe war.    SIR CLARENDON HYDE asked what would happen  in the case of men whohad entered an industry since war commenced, but had subsequently enlisted.    MR. YOUNG said that the man originally employed must go back.    THE  CHAIRMAN  agreed.  He  thought  that  any  man  who had  left hisemployment  for  some other  form  of work  deemed  to  be  of greater  nationalimportance should have the first claim, and of such men soldiers should come Srst,But it might be that owing to altered conditions an individual employer had no  longeremployment to offer.    MR. YOUNG said that in such instances a man must fall back upon the Exchanges.    SIR CLARENDON  HYDE felt that  you must draw the line at the 4th August,1914, and that men should be reinstated in the order of their application.    THE CHAIRMAN felt the principle laid down by Mr. Young was a sound one,but that it would need modification.    MR. CALTHROP thought it was essential that an employer should say not onlywhether he could take a man back, but when he could take him back.    MR. REY thought that that made it all the more necessary to use Form (A).    THE CHAIRMAN said that Mr.  Young&apos;s proposal  for  legislative action  wouldrender Question 6 on Form (A) (&quot;did the above employer promise to keep your placeopen for you ? &quot;) irrelevant.    SIR REGINALD BRADE asked how  far Mr. Young&apos;s proposal would settle thequestion of priority.    MR. YOUNG said that it would not affect priority.    THE CHAIRMAN  said  that if the Committee  adopted  the system of tradepriority and made use of the returns given on Form (A) to meet the case of men whorequired  assistance, they might then decide further to  adopt Mr. Young&apos;s proposal.  Itwould then be possible to delete Questions 6 and  7 from Form (A) and to substitutefor them questions as to the nature of work required.  In  the  case of 80 per cent, ofthe returning men, details  would be  available on Form (A), and the EmploymentExchange would know who was the man&apos;s previous employer and whether that employerwas in a position to re-employ him, and if this was  impossible,  what other form of workthe man would prefer.   Some of the men would go to the Exchanges, but others  mightgo straight to their work.    MR. REY said that they had to face the difficulty of the employer  refusing  or notbeing able to re-employ a man.    MR. YOUNG said that he proposed to make  it incumbent upon an employer todismiss the whole of his &quot;dilutees.&quot;    THE CHAIRMAN proposed that Questions G and 7 on Form A) should disappear.He felt that the other information which Mr. Rev and  Mr. Calthrop desired  to havewould be  obtained if  Appendix (F) (Ministry of Labour  Report), were sent to theemployer.    MR. REY asked what would happen in the case of a man who had gone to  a firmlong after the outbreak of war, and then, on enlistment in  the  army, had obtained nopromise of re-employment.    THE CHAIRMAN said that if the Committee  adopted JVTr. Youngs suggestionthe question of a promise would not arise, as the employer would be compelled to takethe man back.    MR. BUTLER said that the proposed letters to  employers  (Appendices  (E) and(F)) would need recasting.  Even if employers were placed under statutory obligation,there would still be a large number of cases in which Form (A) would be necessary    GENERAL  BURNETT-HITCHCOCK thought that the armv  would  welcomeMr. Youngs proposal, but it was still necessary to  consider  cases where  a man did notwant to return to the same work, and also  the fact that, though the employer  might
the war and replace him  by an ex-soldier who had  been \m his  employment  beforethe war.    SIR CLARENDON HYDE asked what would happen  in the case of men  whohad entered an industry since war commenced, but had subsequently enlisted.    MR. YOUNG  said that the man originally employed must go back.    THE   CHAIRMAN  agreed.  He  thought  thatemployment  for  some other  form  of work  deemed  to  be  of greater  nationalimportance should have the first claim, and of such men soldiers should come Grst.But it might be that owing to altered conditions an individual employer had no longeremployment to offer.    MR. YOUNG said that in such instances a man must fall back upon the Exchanges.    SIR CLARENDON  HYDE felt that  you must draw the line at  the 4th August,1914, and that men should be reinstated in the order of their application.    THE  CHAIRMAN felt  the principle laid down by Mr. Young was a sound  one,but that it would  need modification.    MR.

THE CHAIRMAN said that Mr.  Young&apos;s proposal  for legislative action  wouldrender Question 6 on Form (A) (&quot;did the above employer  promise to  keep your placeopen tor you ? &quot;) irrelevant.    SIR REGINALD BRADE asked how far Mr. Young&apos;s proposal would settle thequestion of priority.    MR. YOUNG said that it would not affect priority.

BUTLER said that the proposed letters to employers (Appendices (E)  and (F)) would need recasting.   Even if employers were placed under statutory obligation,there would still be a large number of cases in which Form (A) would be necessary     GENERAL  BURNETT-HITCHCOCK  thought  that the army would welcomeMr. Youngs proposal, but it was still necessary to consider cases: where a man did not want to return to the same work,  and also  the fact that,  though  the  employer might
G  be  compelled to take a man  back, that would not prevent  him dismissing  the  man   again after a week or two.       MR.  YOUNG did not anticipate that there would be any difficulty in meeting   such a case.       THE CHAIRMAN said that in the case of an employer who claimed that he had   no  work to offer, the test to  be applied  would be whether  he  had dismissed  all his   &quot;dilutees.&quot;       THE CHAIRMAN asked whether it was agreed that demobilisation should take   place according to priority of trades.       MR.  REY said it would be impossible  to determine priority of trades without   Form (A).       SIR  REGINALD BRADE explained  that  he originally  drafted  Form  (A)  in   December  1914 in collaboration  with Sir  H.  Llewellyn ISmith at a time ^ when  no   other machinery of  the kind had been devised.  Circumstances had altered since then,   and.he now preferred that the main  scheme ot bringing back men should be that of   priority by trades within each of which priority would  go according to the results oi   the use of Form (A).       THE CHAIRMAN asked what a commanding officer would do who was told that   he  must make use both of Form (A.) and of the system of trade priority.       MR,  REY said that supposing a commanding officer were asked to supply a draft   of  twenty men, and  had in  his  possession fifteen &quot;tear off&quot; slips from  Form (A),   he  might then make up his draft  of twenty men by sending the  fifteen men to  whom   the &quot;tear off&quot;  slips referred  and taking the five remaining men according to trade   priority.       THE CHAIRMAN&apos; asked whether he should have a  draft report prepared  of   which the proposed  use of Form (A) should be an integral  part, and in which it should   be laid down that officers, in forming  drafts, would  take first  of all men for whom they   had &quot; tear off&quot; slips, and after them men according  to trade priority.       GENERAL BURNETT-HITCHCOCK said  it  would  be necessary to  add the   words &quot; unless required for military duty.&quot;       The Committee agreed that  a  draft report  should  be  prepared for considera-   tion at the next meeting, setting out a scheme for demobilisation of which the use  of   Form (A)  would be  an integral part, and  laying down   that  in  forming  drafts   commanding officers should take, first of all, those  men  for whom they had &quot; tear off&quot;   siins,  and after  them  men according to trade priority, regard  being  had always  to   military requirements.       THE CHAIRMAN said that, as  regards Mr. Young&apos;s  proposal, he moved that   the Committee should accept generally the principle that  soldiers should have the first   claim on  employment after  the  war, and that  a  small Sub-Committee should  be   appointed to draft a paragraph of the report in suitable terms.       MR. CALTHROP said that  he  would first  of  all  like to  ask Mr. Young what   would happen in the  case of a certain  station on  the London and  North Western   Railway, in which there were  800 places  which had been filled since the war by 3,000   different men.       CAPTAIN  JONES said  that in such a  case the  date  of  substitution would  be   the determining factor.       MR.  YOUNG agreed.       THE CHAIRMAN proposed that  the  Sub-Committee should consist of Sir-   Clarendon Hyde, Mr. Calthrop, and Mr. Young.      MR. CALTHROP regretted that he would be  unable  to  serve,  and said that   pressure of work would, he feared,  compel him to resign from  the Committee.      THE CHAIRMAN asked  Mr.  Butler  to take  Mr.  Calthrops place on  the:   Sub-Committee.         [899-27]                                                        H
     The Committee agreed to the Chairmans  proposal that the Committee  shouldaccept generally the principle that soldiers should have the first claim on employmentafter the  war, and appointed  a Sub-Committee, consisting of Sir Clarendon  Hyde,Mr.  Young, and Mr. Butler,  to  consider the matter1  and prepare in this connection, asuitable paragraph for insertion  in their next Report.     GENERAL  BURNETT-HITCH COCK asked  whether the Committee  wouldconsider the case of men who on their  return to  civil life were only fit  for part-timeemployment.     MR.  COLEGATE  explained that  this  point  was  already  under. considerationhy  the Pensions Statutory  Committee and by the various trade Committees appointedto deal with the question of  the employment of disabled soldiers.     THE CHAIRMAN  said he  felt  that points  were bound  to  arise  on which  itwould be necessary to consult the Ministry of Pensions.  He referred to a point raisedin a letter from Sir William Goulding on the question  of the Workmens CompensationAct  in relation to partially disabled soldiers.     SIR WILLIAM. GOULDING said that in Dublin some employers were refusingto employ partially disabled  men because of this difficulty7.     MR.  REY explained that  the Engineering  and  Shipbuilding  Committee  on theemployment of disabled soldiers  had agreed that  the employer ought to be  relieved  ofany additional liability under the Workmens Compensation  Act which might be due  todisablement, and that  the State  should bear this additional cost.     The Committee &quot;decided that  the  question of liability under the WorkmensCompensation Act due to the partial disablement of ex-soldiers was a  matter for theMinistry of Pensions.     THE CHAIRMAN  drew  the  attention of the Committee  to  paragraph  6  inSir  David Shackleton&apos;s Minute of the 23rd July, with regard  to direct  communicationbetween a soldier and  his previous employer.  He agreed that in framing arrangementsfor demobilisation no regard should be  paid to such communications, but he did not seehow it would be possible to prevent a man communicating with his employer.     MR. REY said that the Ministry of Labour did not suggest that a man shouldbe prevented from writing  to  his employer, but  they felt very strongly that,  ifunauthorised agencies  were allowed to  step in, complications  would be bound  to arise.     THE CHAIRMAN next turned to the question of the date on which unemploymentbenefit should commence, which  was raised in Mr. Rey&apos;s Minute of the 10th  July.  Hethought that the suggestion of  a  montlTs interval between the date  of  dischargefrom  the Arm)7 and the commencement of free unemployment insurance had originallycome from  the  Trade  Union Congress.     MR. REY&quot; said that he felt  that now that the pace of demobilisation had beenso greatly  quickened there were  larger  possibilities of unemployment.     MR.  BELLAMY thought that the suggestion of  a  montlTs interval was made in aMemorandum submitted to the Committee  by Sir IT. Llewellyn Smith after consultationwith a few Trade Union leaders.   The  Trade Union Congress had not been  friendly tothe proposal.     MR. LEITH ROSS did not see that the  increased rate of demobilisation wouldmake any  difference in the hardship which  would  be likely to fall on individuals.     MR. YOUMG said that he had understood that when a man went  on furlough hewas finally discharged, and that  unemployment benefit would  take effect  immediatelyafter furlough.     THE CHAIRMAN read a Memorandum  by Sir H. Llewellyn  Smith,  dated the25th July, 1.91G, in which he stated that he had obtained confidentially the views of  adeputation of the  Parliamentary Committee of the Trade  Union Congress, who  hadcome to the Board of Trade to discuss  another insurance matter, upon  the  subject of
    GENERAL BURNETT-HITCHCOCK said that  he would  like  to  raise somepoints of detail in connection  with the report  of the Ministry of Labour Committee.He urged that all &quot;tear off&quot; slips  should  be  posted to commanding officers throughthe War Office.  It  was essential that the War Office should retain control of theirmen.    THE CHAIRMAN asked  whether the remedy would  not be that  &quot;tear  off&quot;slips should be posted direct by the Employment Exchange to  the  commanding  officer,but in cases where it was desirable from a military point of view that any man  shouldnot return at  that time,  the War Office should issue instructions  to the commandingofficer concerned to take no notice  of those particular slips.    GENERAL BURNETT-HITCHCOCK agreed that the system of sending theenvelopes through his  office in  bulk might take longer, but felt that a question  ofprinciple was involved.    THE CHAIRMAN said  that the War Office  had  been  so  helpful to the Com-mittee  that  he was most  anxious  to meet them  on  this point.   But it  was mostimportant that the procedure should be as simple and rapid as  possible.   He suggestedthat paragraph 28 of the Ministry  of  Labour Report should be accepted  subject  toreconsideration if the Army Council should so urge.    The Committee accepted this proposal.unemployment insurance for ex-soldiers.  They had themselves suggested an interval oftwo  weeks,  or possibly  longer, between  the  end  of . working  furlough and  thecommencement of insurance benefit.    MR. YOUNG said that he considered the interval of one month too  long.  Hethought that the usual &quot;waiting week &quot; would be quite sufficient interval.    THE CHAIRMAN asked whether there would be any waiting period at all.    MR. BELLAMY explained that under  Mr. Young&apos;s suggestion  there  would notnecessarily be any interval  between cessation of pay and commencement  of benefit.But if during the &quot; waiting week &quot; any employment had been offered to a man and refused,he would lose the chance of benefit.    MR. REY thought it should be possible  for an ex-soldier to come to the Exchangefor  his policy one week before&apos;  the  end  of furlough, which would mean  that benefitwould date from the end of furlough.  Of course, he might come earlier for the purpose ofseeking employment.    The  Committee  agreed that there should be no interval between the  end of anex-soldier&apos;s working furlough and the commencement of free unemployment insurance.    THE CHAIRMAN turned to Mr. Leith Rosss Memorandum dated the l!th July,on the question of the method of payment  of war gratuities, &amp;c.  He explained thatMr Leith Ross objeeted to the introduction of any option as to the method of payment.He doubted whether it would be practicable  to refuse payment in cash to ex-soldiers ofwar gratuities.    GENERAL BURNETT-HITCHCOCK  explained that the war gratuity might beonly bl., but that the balance of pay due to  a man might reach a high figure.   Itwould be possible for a soldier to demand his  balance of pay in  France, but  the  officercommanding unit would have discretion as  to how much  he paid him.   A  soldier onleaving his dispersal station would get 21. on account.  All outstanding moneys  stilldue to him, whether by  way of war gratuity or balance of pay, would be  lumpedtogether and paid in three  instalments through the Post Office, the protection certificateidentifying the man to whom the special postal or money order was addressed.    SIR  REGINALD  BRADE explained that  that  did not mean that it would bepaid through the Savings Bank account, which involved great labour.    The  Committee  decided that,  in view particularly of  the proposal that   alloutstanding moneys  due to the soldier  should  be paid in three instalments duringfurlough,  it was not necessary or desirable to  proceed with the scheme for the paymentof war gratuities and arrears of pay into special Savings Bank accounts or  in the formof War Savings Certificates.
    GENERAL BURNETT-HITCHCOCK then  drew attention  to  paragraph 34 ofthe Ministry of Labour Report.  He said that the words  &quot;identification slip&quot;  shouldread &quot;protection  certificate.&quot;  As  regards paragraphs 41 and 42, he proposed to issuea leaflet to  all soldiers giving full information as to demobilisation.  In paragraph 43&quot;protection  certificate&quot; should be substituted  for &quot;discharge certificate.&quot;   In para-graphs 7 and 8 of the Summary of Recommendations  the words &quot; if not required formilitary duty &quot; should be added.    MR. COLEGATE said that a statement  of  various detailed changes  renderednecessary by inter-departmental discussions since the  date of the  Ministry of LabourReport was being prepared.    The Committee  accepted  in  principle the Report  of the  Departmental Com-mittee of the Ministry of Labour on  demobilisation  procedure, subject to  necessarymodification of detail.  It &quot;was  further  agreed  that  a draft  final Report should besubmitted to the Committee at its next meeting.                                   Conclusions.    1. A draft Report should be prepared  for consideration  at  the next meeting,including in the arrangements for demobilisation a scheme of which Form (A) would bean  integral part,  and  in  which it should  be  laid  down  that in forming  draftscommanding officers would take first of all those men for whom they had &quot;tear off&quot;slips, and after them men according to trade priority, due regard being had to militaryrequirements.    2. The Committee accepted the  principle  that  soldiers should have the  firstclaim  to employment  after  the  war, and appointed a Sub-Committee, consisting ofSir Clarendon Hyde, Mr. Young, and Mr. Butler, to consider the  matter and prepare asuitable paragraph for insertion in the next Report.    3. The Committee agreed that no  interval should elapse between the end of anex-soldier&apos;s working furlough and the commencement of free unemployment insurance.    4. The Committee decided  not  to proceed  with the proposal for the payment ofWar Gratuities and arrears of pay into a special Savings Bank account.    5. The Committee approved generally of  the proposals contained  in the Report ofthe Departmental Committee of the Ministry of Labour on Demobilisation  Procedure. Minutes of  the Tenth Meeting, hell at 3T5 P.M. on August 1, 1917.                            Present:The Right Hon. E. S. Montagu (Chairman).Mr. A.

Upcott,    )  a    Mr.  W. A. Colegate,  j Secreta^es-    Om the niotion  of the Chairman, the Committee decided to consider the  draftsecond (interim) report, paragraph by paragraph.Paragraph 2.    THE CHAIRMAN  thought it would be well to draw attention to the necessityof acquiring sufficient accommodation at French ports.
    MR. LEITH ROSS  objected to the proposal that the last week of furlough shouldhe counted as the waiting week for  unemployment benefit, provided that the mansigned his vacant book  at the  employment exchange or trade union during the lastweek  of furlough.  He  thought  that the present arrangement of a waiting  weekafforded a valuable financial security.  The war gratuity would  tide the  soldier overany temporary difficulty.    MR. REY did not agree.   The gratuity was given for services fully rendered.   Ifthe soldier took the trouble to sign his book during the last week  of furlough, that wasevidence of the fact that  he was anxious to obtain emplojmrent.    MR. YOUNG said  that Mr. Leith Ross&apos;s proposal  practically amounted to finingthe soldier.    The Committee agreed that the paragraph should stand as drafted.    THE CHAIRMAN  said that it  was proposed to add after paragraph 5 the  draftclause prepared  by Sir Clarendon Hyde&apos;s Committee, which  proposed that  priority ofemployment should be assured to the ex-soldier by legislation.    MR. BELLAMY did not consider that much would  be gained by  introducinglegislation on this subject. It would be very easy for an  employer who did  not reallydesire to take back a man to get rid of him soon after his re-employment.   He thoughtthat if the moral obligation was not sufficient for an employer,&apos;he would  be likely tofind means of evading the law.    MR. YOUNG  thought  that legislation  was absolutely essential-   But  if this.obligation were to remain in force for a period of only three months from the  date of  a.      [899-27]                                 &apos;                        IC      GENERAL BURNETT-HITCHCOCK said that that would be very useful to   the War Office.  He would  like  to add a suggestion  that  there should be  early   negotiations with the Belgian and  Dutch Governments  as regards ^facilities at their   ports  for the transport of prisoners and interned men.   It  would  also be  a  great   advantage  if the  Portuguese troops  and workmen could be railed via France and   Spain.   Paragraph  3.       GENERAL BURNETT-HITCHCOCK  said that  he  knew that Sir Reginald   Brade, who had not  yet arrived, would  like  to draw  attention in the report to the   value of an armistice from the point of view of demobilisation arrangements.       The Committee decided that a sentence should be added to the report bringing out   this point.   Paragraph  5.       MR. LEITH ROSS said he thought that no sufficient argument had been adduced   for the raising of the maximum rate of free unemployment insurance benefit above 2,0s.,   which  in many occupations was  almost  as  high as the full  employment wage.   If   unemployment  benefit  were fixed  at  30s.,  it  might be  difficult for  the Ministry  of   Labour to refuse payment supposing an applicant decided not to accept a post which   had been offered to him below that figure.       SIR CLARENDON  HYDE  said that the  agricultural  labourer would be the   most difficult case to  deal with.       MR. YOUNG said a man would  be  compelled to.accept the district wage for his   trade,       SIR DAVID SHACKLETON said  that  he favoured the maximum of 25s.   It   was necessary to bear in mind the fact that unemployment insurance must be provided   for munition workers, and it would be difficult to retain the  ordinary rate of 7s. for   them,  if the rate for soldiers were put at too high a figure.       After some discussion, the Committee decided, on  the proposal of the Chairman,   that mention  should  be made  in  the report of the fact  that three figures, 20s., 25s.,   and 30s., had been suggested as a possible maximum, but that, in view of the difficulties,   the actual figure should be left for decision by the Departments concerned.
man&apos;s discharge from  the  army, it would not, in his opinion, be sufficient  to  cover thecase of those men who were  demobilised first of all, because  owing to reconstructiondifficulties the employer might not be able to take his man back at once.     On the proposal of the Chairman, the  Committee agreed to adopt the draft clauseprepared by Sir Clarendon Hycle&apos;s  Committee.   They decided that the  obligation  tore-employ an ex-soldier should remain in  force for a  period  of three  months from aman&apos;s discharge from  the army, or for two weeks from the date (within the first year ofdemobilisation) at which  work  was offered by the employer to  the  man, whicheverperiod might be the longer.Paragraph 8.     SIR  REGINALD  BRADE  proposed to substitute the words &quot; who undertake  tocontinue their  services after the war&quot; for the words &quot; who  are prepared  to  enlist  forservice after the war.&apos;1  He was anxious also to make mention of the fact that a  largenumber of units now overseas which would require relief consisted of men belonging tothe Territorial  Force.     THE  CHAIRMAN felt that somewhere  mention  ought to be made of the factthat the Government  had already decided  on  arrangements for the demobilisation  ofthe Dominion contingents.     The Committee decided that the paragraph should be amended accordingly.Paragraph 9.     SIR  REGINALD  BRADE said that, as  regards the return of the &quot;tear  off&quot;slip to the commanding  officer by the local Employment  Exchange, the War Office stilldid not like this  direct  form of communication.   They would suggest that the mattershould be left  to the small inter-departmental committee mentioned in paragraph  12.He did not think that  the delay involved  in sending them through  the Director  ofMobilisation would amount to more than 24 hours.     MR.  COLEGATE  explained  that  these  forms  would  be  passing  from  theirdistrict offices to the officers&apos; commanding units at a very rapid pace.   They hoped  todeal with  about 3,000,000 forms in from eight to ten weeks.     THE  CHAIRMAN said that  he  still felt  it would  be simpler to post the slipsdirect, but he  proposed that the consideration of the most  effective way of dealingwith them should be left to the Inter-Departmental Committee.     The Committee agreed to this proposal.Paragraph 10.     THE  CHAIR,MAN explained  that Mr.  Butler, who was unable  to  be present,would like it made quite clear in this paragraph that group priority, and not individualtrade priority, was contemplated.     The  Committee  agreed that  the words should be  added to the  paragraph asproposed by Mr. Butler.Paragraph 11.     Certain minor verbal  alterations were accepted by the Committee.Paragraph 15.     MR.  LEITH ROSS said that he felt that the proposals in this paragraph requiredmuch  further  consideration.   It was  no  doubt  reasonable  to continue existing civilliatalities grants, in cases of hardship, for  some  period after discharge, but the periodshould be limited to six months.  The extension, of grants to new applicants (if requiredat all) would entail  the creation of a.  new scheme, as the basis on which  the  CivilLiabilities Committee worked would disappear with the return of the soldier.   Further,he was doubtful whether  local committees  could be  entrusted with anything beyond the preliminary  investigation  of facts.   He  understood that Sir Clarendon Hydes Sub-Committee merely recommended the preparation of a scheme by the Civil Liabilities Committee for consideration, and he thought this should be  made clear in the report.     TSie  Committee decided to suggest that the Civil Liabilities Committee should at once proceed to draw up a scheme for the consideration of the Treasury.
rAPPENDIX II.            MEMORANDA RELATING- TO THE  RATE  OF DEMOBILISATION.                           Minute by Sir R. II. Brade.Mr. Montagu,    At the last meeting of your  Committee  you put  to me a question which  I wasunable to answer at the moment, and the  reply to which  I promised to send to youlater.    The question was, as I recollect it, as follows:         &quot; What is the lowest rate at which the War Office could demobilise assuming    that the men from France continued to be brought over at the maximum rate ? &quot;    I had informed  your Committee that the maximum rate from France is estimatedat present at 20,0u0 a day.  It will be understood that this is an estimate only.    Apart  from any  question of policy  the problem is  one of  accommodation.  Atpresent the number of troops in the United  Kingdom  is approximately 1,700,000, ofwhich 200,000 consist  of Dominion troops.  These are housed  in barracks and huttedcamps, with the exception of 400,000 in hired buildings and  200,000 in billets.   It isalmost certain that owing to  various  causes  there  will be at the  commencement ofdemobilisation more than 1,700,000  in  the United  Kingdom.   Certainly during anvarmistice there will be a tendency to congestion at home by the holding up of reinforce-ments and drafts for  armies  abroad (which  may be aggravated  by the desire or thenecessity to clear stations abroad  of convalescents and the like), while at the same timerecruiting will probably be  proceeding.  If the  Dominion  contingents  in France andabroad take advantage of the opportunities for leave in this country which  have beenpromised, further additions to the troops in the United Kingdom will result.  On theother  hand, the accommodation available is not likely to be increased.   If the weatherbe favourable, and  for so long as  it continues  so, additional accommodation may befound in tents;  but the demands from the various theatres of war are  increasing andthe forecast is that, with the diminishing  resources  in labour and material, the tentageavailable in this  country at the end of the war will be limited.  It is doubtful whetherthere  wiil be a supply at all  equal  to the extra numbers which may be anticipated inaccordance  with the considerations given  above.  In any case, it  will  be  necessary tocontinue the  billeting  powers now in force, but it is  unlikely that  public sentiment or,indeed, convenience  will permit of greater resort to this expedient.    On the whole, therefore, the answer to your question would appear to be that therate of demobilisation  could not go lower than the rate at which men are brought homefrom France.      SIR  REGINALD  BRADE  drew  attention  to .the  interim  report  of  the Resettlement uf Officers Committee, of which he was Chairman.      The Committee decided to adopt this report, and it was agreed that the paragraph should be redrafted accordingly.      THE CHAIRMAN mentioned the fact that Sir C. Hyde, who had been unable to remain until the end of the meeting, had left with him a draft paragraph dealing with the question of the disposal of the mens uniforms.      SIR REGINALD BRADE explained that this question was still under considera- tion.  A Committee of the War Office had just made a report on  the subject, and this, with departmental remarks on the  recommendations, would be submitted to the Council very shortly.                                     Conclusion.      The Committee decided that their Second (Interim) Report should be  amended in accordance with the decisions reached at this  meeting, and that it should be circulated to members for their final approval.
     The question appears to be prompted by the calculation that the labour marketmight not be in a position to digest as large a number as the total of 40,000 which Ihad quoted.   This refers, I  take it, to the floating labour population which is notassigned,  so to  speak, to definite  employers.  If so. and if the numbers for whomemployers will ask  by name are large, the difficulty does not appear to be considerableand can  be  met  by  including  in the daily  stream of  returning  soldiers  a  smallproportion only of what  I call the unassigned, and  so spreading  the meal over thelongest time possible.   Another expedient for relieving the stream without materiallychecking the pace  of  demobilisation might be to set free  earlier, or to a greater ratethan would have been called for otherwise,  men of occupational  groups such as 41.  Imav, however, not have interpreted correctly the  view s of the Labour Department, andI only give these considerations in diffidence and for what they are worth.     But  a question  of  policy   of  great  importance  arises.   In  the foregoingthere  is  no  reference to  the paramount  consideration,  viz., the  wishes   of themen themselves.  It  is  certain  that  everyone  of the men will  desire  to  resumehis home-life at once.   &apos;Each will  hope to  be in  the earliest draft out of his  militaryformation.  It  is equally uncertain that, whatever the state of the labour market isrepresented by the Government to be,&apos;the men will regard  statements on the  subjectas estimates, and, even if  they do not discount  them freely, they will  still  clamour tobe released from Military Service  and to be sent on the  promised furlough.  To  placein their way obstacles which are not those merely of limited resources of accommodation,transport, or the like,  would be resented, and the task of the Military Authorities inattempting to  retain  within   the  only bounds  which  are available, viz.,  militarydiscipline, men who have practically ceased to be soldiers would be quite impractical de.                                                                R. H. BRADE.     April 24, 1917.                      Memorandum by the Ministry of Labour.Mr. Montagu,    Sir Reginald Brade&apos;s minute  of the  24th April on  the subject of the  rate  ofdemobilisation puts a completely new aspect on the question, which, in the opinion  ofthe Ministry of Labour, demands very careful consideration.    It has  hitherto been assumed that the period  of demobilisation would necessarilyextend over from six to twelve months.   It will be  remembered that  during the earlysittings of the Committee the figure generally put forward was 20,000 .every four clays,which  would have involved a total period for  demobilisation of nearly two years.  Atthe fifth  meeting Sir Reginald Brade  brought the figure up to 20,000 per dav, andstated that he did not think it was possible that this figure  could  be  exceeded.   Thatfigure,  creating a very much more difficult problem for the employment exchanges thanthe original figure  of 5,o00 per day, was, nevertheless,  accepted  by the Ministrv  ofLabour, as they felt the strength of the arguments  in favour of rapid demobili-ation.On the other hand, the proposal now  made that the rate should be not 20.000, but40,000 a day. would, in the opinion of the Ministry,  create such a serious situation thatthey cannot see their way to accepting it, unless the whole scheme of  demobilisation  issubstantially modified.    As Mr. Butler and  Mr. Rey pointed out at the  sixth meeting of the Committee,the prospect of having such a large  number  of men thrown on the labour  market  insuch a  short time must be viewed with  serious  alarm, and,  while it was understood that40,000 a day was a  conceivable maximum in view of the arrangements which had beenperfected  by the War Office for the  rapid conveyance of troops from  the continent,  itwas  certainly not contemplated that the actual rate of  discharge would in any wayapproximate to this  figure.    In the first place,  it has to be  pointed out  that  in  any case  the staff of theEmployment Exchanges is certain to be subjected  to a pressure such as it has neverhad to meet before.   Not only will it have to deal with the  men discharged from thearmy both as regards the finding of employment for them and the making out of cardsfor their  unemployment insurance, but it will  at the same time  have to^deal with theenormous  transfer of labour which will be produced  by the cessation of Avar industriesand  the resumption of  peace  conditions.   The  strain on  the  Exchanges  would besufficiently severe even  were the rate of demobilisation only 20,000 a day,  but  if therate were 40,000 it would certainly be impossible to find  work within a reasonable
 time for  anything like the  number of men requiring it, not because  the  machinery would be inadequate, but  because under no circumstances would the market conceivably absorb men at this rate.   Until the industries are once more placed on a peace footing the amount  of  employment,  available will  necessarily be curtailed  to  a considerable extent.   During the first three months of demobilisation a  considerable number of industries will be still in a state of suspended activity because the process of conversion from war to  peace will not have been completed.  It has also to be remembered that on the commercial side there is  bound to be a great deal of uncertainty during the first months after the war, until the demand from the various markets can  be ascertained and until it is possible to foresee with  some degree of clearness  what the  conditions affecting credit and the facilities for shipping and railway transport will be.     The consideration of  these factors points to  the conclusion that  either the rate of demobilisation must be  slackened  so  that (a) the  later categories  should not  he discharged until the labour market has begun to settle down, or  (6) that, if they are discharged before this takes place, very  large numbers of them will become unemployed at the end of their montlTs furlough and much more comprehensive measures than those already proposed will be required to cope with the problem.   It appears to the Ministry of Labour quite out of the question to  contemplate several  hundreds of thousands of men being thrown pell-mell on to a  labour market that cannot hope to absorb them, and becoming unemployed with only 10s. a week on which  to  live,  within a few weeks of their having finished serving  their country with  the Colours ; and they venture to think that such a proposal would not be tolerated by Parliament or  the public.     At the same time, the Ministry is bound to  admit  the force  of  the  arguments  in favour of rapid demobilisation advanced in Sir Reginald Brade&apos;s memorandum.   It cannot be doubted that the feeling of the vast majority of the men themselves would be  in favour of immediate discharge, and that  apart altogether from the  difficulty  of accommodating  them at  home, it  would be difficult  to  retain  them under- military discipline for any length of time.     In the face of the above considerations there appear to be only two possible alternatives -either the maximum rate of demobilisation should remain at the original figure of 20,000 a day, thus giving the civil  authorities some chance of placing the men in employment, or else, if demobilisation proceeds at the rate of 40,000 a day and has to  be  completed in three months  instead  of six,  some method  must  be devised  of entitling the soldier to draw  his military pay for, say, three months before he becomes eligible for unemployment insurance,  assuming  that he cannot be found  work.   The Ministry of Labour  has already  acquiesced in  the  former of these twro alternatives, although it does not conceal from itself that  even this rate is likely to prove more rapid than  the  power of the labour  market to absorb the  men  returned.  As regards the second alternative, it may be  pointed out that in the earlier phases of the discussion it was contemplated, without any demur on the part either of the War Office or of the lreasuiy, that very large numbers of men not required for the army would remain on the army funds for a period of six months, or even two years.  It cannot therefore be objected that the proposal to  extend the period  during which the soldier is entitled to draw pay and allowances, in order  to bring  it up to a total of four  months after the date of discharge,  is  imposing a burden on army funds which it  was never  intended they should bear.     When the scheme of unemployment insurance was originally drafted it  was done in view of a demobilisation extending over eighteen months or two years, which would give plenty of time for the labour market to  resume its normal state.   This would have meant that there would only  have been  a certain amount of casual unemployment, but not unemployment on a wholesale scale.   To meet such conditions a benefit of 10s.  a week was perhaps  sufficient,  as the  soldier  would have had a reasonable prospect of obt ainmg  work before long without any very  great  difficulty.   This does not apply, however, to the case of demobilisation taking place within a  period of three months after peace, which must ensure its occurring during a totally abnormal industrial period. &apos;1 o meet this situation something more is obviously required than an unemployment benefit of 10s. a week.    The Ministry therefore suggest  that, if the original scheme, by which demobilisation was to last at least six  months, is to  be  abandoned,  in view of the  objections toretaining men in the army in  this country after peace has been proclaimed, the month&apos;s furlough on full pay and allowance should be extended  to  every man for whom work cannot be  found at the end of that period up  to  a total of six months from the initialdate of demobilisation or four  months from the date of the  man&apos;s discharge, whichever      [899-27]                                                         K
is the longer, find  that no  man should  be called upon to draw his  unemploymentinsurance benefit until four months have  elapsed  from the date of his discharge.  Itwould, of course, be a corollary to this proposal that it would not be left to the man todecide whether he should accept suitable employment when it was offered him, but thatit would rest with the local demobilisation committee to recommend the stoppage of hispay and allowances if he refused to  take work of a  suitable character when it wasoffered to him.  In reaching their decision they would of course be guided by the sameprinciples as those which would be adopted in deciding  whether a man  was entitled todraw unemployment insurance.     The above proposal is, in the opinion of the Ministry of Labour, the least that canbe done if the conditions likely to arise from demobilisation at an approximate rate of40,000 a day are to be palliated to a degree  which will prevent widespread unemployment,and the serious troubles which are certain  to ensue from it.   They feel some misgivingsas to the possibility of finding employment with sufficient rapidity, even if the rate isonly 20,000 a  day, and they would have liked the period of furlough extended in thecase of unemployment even in  this case.   They do  not feel, however, in a  position topress this proposal at the present stage, though they consider that  there is a great dealto be said for the principle which it is stated that the German Government has adoptedof not discharging  a  man from the Army until he has found employment.  It  is, ofcourse, recognised that it would be difficult to keep the men with the Colours for thereasons pointed out by Sir Reginald Brade, but there can be no question that it wouldbe a more handsome and appropriate recognition of their services to treat and pay themen as soldiers until they can be found a place in civil life,  rather than  to throw themon  the  labour market  with  the prospect  of many of  them joining the ranks of theordinary unemployed  with an additional benefit  of 3-v. a week.  The Ministry  must,however, press the proposal made above if  the rat&quot; is to approximate  40,000  a day, andthey would point out in conclusion that, if their fears are unfounded  and employmentcan be found, the cost involved will be slight, whereas, if their  fears are well grounded,and  widespread unemployment is produced, the men will at least realise that they areas well off as if they had remained in the Army.     Ministry of Labour, May 21, 1917.    Note by Sir R. R. Brade on Memorandum of May 21, 1917, from Ministry of                             Labour to Mr. Montagu.    The position with which the minute starts is that the War Office hopes to be ableto demobilise men from France at a maximum rate of 20,000 a day, so that, if men inEngland are to be demobilised at the same rate, the total may reach a maximum rateof 40,000 a dav.    The Ministry of Labour, on  the other hand, do  not think that the country  canabsorb more than 20,000  a dav.  This figure it  is impossible to criticise withoutknowing what is the basis of calculation, but it is not clear what reasons  the Ministryof Labour have for believing that 20,000 and  not 15,000 or 25,000 can be absorbeddaily.    The minute  seems  to be written on the  assumption  that a  maximum rate of40,000 a clay means that we shall demobilise (e.g.) 3,i 00,000  men in  90 days.   This,however, is mistaken.  Only about 60 per cent, of the military forces can be demobilisedat the maximum rate.   The remaining men will  be retained with  the  cadres forhandling stores, &amp;c, and released in  a stream which  may flow for many  months afterdemobilisation  has begun.   From this number, moreover, must be deducted the  menwho will be retained for the future standing army, overseas reliefs, &amp;c.   Demobilisation,therefore, will not be &quot; completed in three months&quot; as is suggested in the minute underreference.    It  is  improbable, therefore, that the&apos;maximum wiil be anything like the averagerate, and I suspect that, if 40,l&apos;00 a day is the maximum speed of which our  machineryis capable, the difference between an  average  output  and the  20,000 a day which  theMinistry are prepared to contemplate will be a good deal less than they  have  assumed.    The Minute also appears to contemplate that all  the demobilised men will come tothe Employment Exchanges for work.  In an earlier  paper on the subject the Board ofTrade estimated that 1,200,000 men would probably be taken back  as soon  as possibleby their former employers.   Whether or not  there is time for the machinery to get towork which is  being devised for the purpose of effecting the early return of men  to
^ their former employments, the Exchange will be relieved of at least the above numbers and will only have to deal with  them  for the purpose of the issue of them unemploy- ment insurance cards, a process that can  be proceeded with  more or  less leisurely, and may be carried out, if necessary, by the aid  of the military authorities. ^     In addition large numbers of men will emigrate, or re-settle in their own businesses and for other reasons not have to go near the  Exchanges  for work.   Nor will  the men he thrown &quot; pell-mell &quot;  on the labour market, as is suggested by the Ministry of Labour, but in  a priority fixed by the national interests and laid down by the Government.     I have dealt elsewhere with certain aspects of the policy of restricting the rate of demobilisation, according to  considerations other than  those of  the capacities of the military machine to discharge the men.     As an alternative to a slowing  down of demobilisation the  Minute  puts  forward the suggestion that, any men who have not found civil employment should receive an extension  of the twenty-eight days&apos;  pay  and  allowance up to  a maximum of four months.  I  do not think the War  Office could  entertain this  suggestion.  It would he an  impossible task  for  the Army  pay and separation allowance authorities to keep in touch for  long and uncertain periods with men migrating from one district to another in search of  work and no longer under military discipline, and the difficulty of deciding on the  men&apos;s and womens claims, with the veto possessed by the local &quot; Demobilisation Committee,&quot; would probably lead to  endless confusion.     Whether in any circumstances this twenty-eight days&apos; pay at present contemplated should  be somewhat extended is a question which might have to be considered ;  but if the men are  to be paid  out of public funds  lor months after they leave  the Army the payment should  take the form of unemployment insurance or civil  grant, and not of Army pay.   It is not a question &apos; see paragraph 7 of the Minute) of throwing an extra burden of perhaps 50,000,0001. or more on to Army rather than other public funds the money  would in any case come out of the Vote of Credit; but the Wrar Office could not accept the responsibility.  In any  case  the alternative proposed would not prevent widespread unemployment but only &quot; unpaid &quot; unemployment.     Ihe suggestion appears  to me to be open to objection on other grounds which do not concern  me  officially.  It seems  to me that those who will be benefited by it are likely to be  mostly those from  whom it  is essential in national interests to remove all excuse  for not finding work and  to whom it is advisable to supply every incentive to early employment.     Incidentally, the discussion seems  to point to the desirability of demobilising at an early stage (l) men employed in agriculture and other trades for which an immediate demand for labour may be expected ; (2) men whose  places are definitely kept open for them.  These classes  will  presumably  cause  the  least  work  to the  Employment Exchanges, and so afford  them time  to  get  into working order before  their heaviest work begins.   It would appear, further, that the  number to be dealt with  on  an average by each exchange or agency would  not be great if, as has been  proposed, there will be 2,000 of these in existence during demobilisation.                                                                R. H. BRADE.     May 29, 1917.APPENDIX III.  CORRESPONDENCE AND MEMORANDA RELATING TO THE METHOD  OE PAYMENT OF                     WAR GRATUITIES AND  ARREARS OF PAY.Dear Minister of Munitions,                                     October 30, 1916.    I have a suggestion to make for the consideration of the  Demobilisation  Sub-Committee of the Reconstruction Committee, and should be obliged if you would layit before them should you think well to do so.    It is proposed to pay war gratuities at the  end of the war to soldiers and  sailors,and the arrears of pay which have been accumulating to the credit of numbers of themwill also be payable.   If these fairly considerable sums  are paid  over  in cash, it isprobable that they  will be squandered by a large proportion of the men in the festivitiesthat will celebrate their return, and in other ways.  On&apos; the other hand, the State hasno right to withhold the money if the man washes to have it and to spend it.    When 1 was at the Post Office it occurred  to me that it might be practicable, and,if so, that it was desirable, to arrange to pay these  sums in the form&apos; of entries in a
savings bank account.  If this  were done, it is probable that  the vis ^ inertia wouldlead to a great deal of money remaining invested ; the State would retain the use of it,and the men would be saved from the temptation of wasting it which would beset themif they were given cash, or if they had a warrant which could  only be made availableif converted  into an equivalent sum in cash. -  At the same time the men could  notcomplain that the money was withheld from them, for if they wished  to use it theycould withdraw it  at  any moment from the post office.   The clerical labour involvedwould probably not be much greater than that required to make out warrants in  theordinary way.  The Savings Bank would also have a unique opportunity of advertisingitself among great- numbers  of people who had not  been  hitherto  in  touch with  it.Where a man nad a savings bank account already, it would probably be  more con-venient to open a second account for him and  amalgamate them at  leisure later, thanto try to prevent duplication at the outset.     Before writing to you on the subject I communicated  the suggestion  to the Post-master-General and asked for his opinion as to its practicability.   I append his reply.                                                 Yours sincerely,                                             (Signed)     HERBERT SAMUEL.  The Right Hon. E. S. Montagu, M.P.Dear Home Secretary,                        General Post Office, October 23, 1916.    I think your  proposal that any gratuities and  arrears of pay receivable by thetroops  on demobilisation should be credited to them in savings bank  accounts hasdistinct possibilities, and I have no objection to your bringing the suggestion before theDemobilisation Sub-Committee of the Reconstruction Committee.   There should be nodifficulty in constructing the  necessary machinery, and, if the  principle is agreed  to, itwould probably be best for representatives of the War Office to meet the Controller ofthe Savings Bank and discuss it.    It seems to us that the books had better be prepared at the Savings Bank oninformation as to amounts  supplied  by  the regimental authorities, and  handed over tothe recipient by the latter.   It  is pretty clear  that they would have to be separateaccounts, ignoring, at any rate for the moment, any existing account which an individualsoldier might possess.   It is possible that legislation would be  required to legalise theexistence of double accounts.                                               Yours sincerely.                                           (Signed)      JOSEPH A.  PEASE.The Right Hon. Herbert Samuel, M.P.Dear Home Secretary,                                           October 31, 1916.    Many thanks for  your letter of the 30th October setting out  your  suggestion fordealing with gratuities paid to members of the forces at the end of the war through thePost Office Savings Bank.   Your suggestion seems to me  at first  sight by far the bestthat I have seen for meeting the demand for immediate payment without running therisk that almost all the money will be spent at once.   1 will gladly bring it before theDemobilisation Sub-Committee, and I certainly think that  it should be further explored.                                                  Yours sincerely,                                              (Signed)      E. S. MONTAGU.The Right Hon. Herbert Samuel, M.P.  Memorandum by Mr. Leith Ross on the Method of Payment of War Gratuities, &amp;c.    It is desirable to obtain at an early date a definite recommendation on the proposalswhich  have been  put  forward  that war gratuities should be  paid  in  some form  ofsecurity [e.g., special Savings Bank account or War Savings certificates) instead,  of  incash.   The subject was raised in Mr. Samuels correspondence with the Chairman, whichwas circulated to the Committee last December, and it was  considered at the meetingon the 4th April last; but it was then decided to leave  it for departmental discussionwith the War Office.    It has, however,  proved impossible to  advance  the consideration of any schemewithout  guidance on the question of principle whether the Savings Bank machinery(assuming that to be adopted as the alternative  to cash  payment) should be utilised  inall cases  or only in the case of those men who voluntarily accept it in lieu of cash.
     There is uo insuperable difficulty about either alternative.  According to the  War Office Scheme of demobilisation, the men are to receive at the dispersal station only an advance of 21. and a warrant for their weekly pay during furlough ;  the war gratuity and arrears of pay are to be forwarded by post to their  homes at the end of furlough. There  would,  therefore, be  sufficient time for  the  Record Offices and  Savings Bank Department to arrange for payment by either  method.  The details would, of course, have to be worked out by a  small Departmental Committee.     But there is a great difference  between the merits of the two  alternatives,  and, before  any Committee is set up to work out a detailed scheme, a decision should be reached as to whether this scheme should be uniform or optional.     From  the administrative point of view, a uniform scheme is in every way preferable. In dealing with so large a number of payments, it becomes important  to have  a simple procedure,  and the introduction of any option means  complication.  If the option were extended, e.g., so as to allow a man to take  part  of  his gratuity in cash and part by way of&apos; a savings bank account, it would probably be unworkable there would be too great a possibility of double payment.   Further, the  institution  of  an option would make it necessary for departments (in the absence of any precise  indication of the numbers who would  accept  each  alternative respectively) to make preparations  on a scale sufficient to enable them to deal with practically the   full  number under either system at a very considerable expense.    From  the currency point of view, too, an optional system is open to objection.  It is probable that at least a very considerable  proportion of the  soldiers would ask for cash.   The War Office, it is  understood, would propose to send a warrant to these men, cashable at any post office.   Such an arrangement would entail a very large  increase inthe standing balances at the local offices;  indeed, it  is quite  conceivable that the Post Office could not arrange it without receiving advices from  day to day as to  the  sums likely to be required in each district.    Above all, however, an option would really not secure the object in view, viz., to safeguard the soldier from the temptation of wasting  his money.  Previous experiments in  regard  to deferred  pay have shown that the bulk of the  money was withdrawn at once, and, though the new army has of course a larger element of responsible men than the old regular forces, it is at least doubtful whether, if the individual is left to choose, any considerable number will offer to accept  a savings bank  account.   Probably nine- tenths would ask for cash, and the remaining tenth  would be just the men  who could be trusted to utilise their money providently without any special machinery.    It may, indeed, be said that payment through the Savings Bank might be regarded as  an attempt to defraud the men of their due,  i.e., cash.   This argument does not bear examination.  The men will  be provided against immediate needs by the advance given to them at the dispersal station and the warrant for  their weekly pay during furlough.   All that  is proposed is that  the gratuity and arrears  should be paid in a form of security, which can  be converted into cash subject to the usual Savings Bankrules, viz.,  ll. can be  withdrawn  on  presentation of  the book or card, and larger sums on written application to the General Post Office.  These limitations can scarcely beregarded as imposing any hardship, and anything less is not likely to be effective.    If then the objects in view i.e.  (1), to prevent a large increase in currency, (2) to safeguard the soldier against  mere  thoughtless waste are to be attained, the  arguments all point to the adoption of a uniform system.  An optional system could be carried  into effect,  if considered desirable, but it is not likely to secure these aims, and  it would entail a complicated and costly administrative machinery.    It would be desirable, therefore,  if the Committee could decide whether they canrecommend that payment should be made uniformly by means  of the Savings Bankmachinery, or,  if this is regarded as impracticable,  whether they consider it desirable toprovide for payment by this machinery in any case.  The question  of principle  once. decided, the departments could prepare a detailed  plan.                                                                      F.  L. R.    July 11, 1917.Memorandum by Sir R. H. Brade on Payment through the Post  Office  Savings Banklof        Gratuities and Balances of Pay, &amp;c, due to Soldiers on demobilisation.    The War Office have given consideration  to the  question partly in consequence ofthe receipt of the following proposals :     In a letter  dated the 30th  October,  1916, Mr.  Herbert Samuel, the then Home      [899-27]                                                   &apos;      L
 Secretary, proposed to Mr. Montagu, as chairman of the Demobilisation Sub-Committee of the Reconstruction Committee, that a special savings bank account should be opened for each man to include  the war gratuity and also  the credit of the mans pay account when the latter was a large amount.   This proposal he  recommended on toe general grounds of encouraging thrift- and preventing the squandering of the money, and pointed out that the State would benefit by  the  facr, that a great deal of the  money would remain invested,  if only through  vis inertice.  In  Mr.  Samuel&apos;s opinion the clerical labour involved would probably not be much greater than that required to make out warrants in the ordinary way, while another important point to his mind was that the Post Office Savings Bank would greatly  benefit by the  advertisement it would  thus receive among large classes hitherto not in touch with it.  At the same time, Mr. Samuel pointed out that  the  State would have  no right  to withhold the money if the men wished to have it and spend it, hut pointed out that the  men would have no grievance on this score, as the money could be withdrawn at any time.     Mr. Montagu welcomed the suggestion as being  at first sight  by far the best one that he had seen for meeting demand for immediate  payment without running the risk of all the  money  being  spent at  once.   He  considered the matter should be further explored and promised to bring it up before his Committee.     Mr. Pease,  the then Postmaster-General, also welcomed  the  suggestion as one containing distinct possibilities  and thought that there should be  no  difficulty  about constructing  the necessary machinery.     Books would  be prepared  at the  savings  banks on  information supplied by the regimental authorities, who would hand over books,  when  prepared,  to the  men. Mr.  Pease agreed with Mr. Samuel  that  in  cases where  a man already  had a savings bank account, his new &quot; gratuity &quot; account would have to  be  separate  to start  with, and pointed out that legislation might be required  to legalise the existence  of these double accounts.     The question, however, was not new  to  the War Office, and it may be of value to the Sub-Committee to have before  it a statement of the arguments pro and eon which the War Office have had  to  consider  more than once,  in theory the scheme seems to have met with  fairly  general  approval  in  the War Office, but this approval has in practically every case been given subject to the stipulation that no embargo should be placed on withdrawals.     The arguments advanced in favour of the scheme are :      (1.) That it would  encourage  thrift  and tend to prevent the squandering of the often considerable  sums that would be due to a soldier on demobilisation.     2. The State would benefit by the amount of the dejDosits which  would be likely (even if chiefly through vis inerkice) to be  left in the Savings  Bank and  at the same time the Post Office Savings Bank would  receive a  unique advertisement among large classes hitherto  unacquainted with its system.   The money could be withdrawn at any time, and the demand for immediate payment thus met without running the risk of all the mone)^ being spent at once.     3. It is urged that we are no longer dealing with the  old professional soldier with little or no idea of saving money, but with a more responsible class among whom habits of thrift would be  more common.  The man, too, would  not be in immediate  need of the money, as the cash pa3mrents proposed would meet the  needs of  the  first twenty- eight days.     4. Also it may be a question for consideration whether when demobilisation comes tne country can spare the ready cash for  the immediate  payment  of all  the sums to which the soldier will be entitled on demobilisation.    The arguments against the proposal are based mainly on precedent      I. It is pointed out that the demand  for early  payment was  universal after the South African War, and that  a contemplated attempt  to pay by  instalments which the War Office then had under consideration in the men&apos;s interests  broke down under Parliamentary criticism.    2. The scheme for  the payment of deferred pay, a scheme on similar  lines to the present proposal, which was in force  from   1893 to 1901, and  of which some details are given below, proved wasteful of effort, and produced little or none of the  advantages hoped for.  It served, in fact, only to demonstrate that a system of investment wiihout restriction on withdrawals was useless.  Nor do more recent experiences  of military habits  in  relation  to  thrift  augur well  for the success  of  the  scheme  now &quot;underconsideration.
C?     3. The argument that we are no longer dealing with the old professional  soldier,   but with quite a different type of individual is a double-edged one.   Not only is the   difference between the two types  capable  of being greatly  exaggerated (e.g.,  the   Yeomanry and  Volunteers in the  South  African  War supplied a large number of   the present Territorial and New Army type),  but  it can be argued with equal force   that the men in the Army to-day being more accustomed to look after themselves than   the old Regulars  might  well  resent State interference with the  prompt payment of   what they would consider their just reward.       4. Even apart from these considerations, it is questionable whether  a man would   be able&apos; to leave this money untouched even if he wanted to.   It can easily be imagined   that at the end of this war prices may be  so High, and the expense  of reconstruction   of homes so considerable, that  the bulk of the men may be compelled  to  withdraw,   especiady in view of the delays in ascertaining  and settling balances of pay  which are   inevitable even under the most carefully organised system.       5.  The scheme would naturally involve extra work in the pay offices ;  considerable   special preparation and printing would be necessary.       6.  The machinery set up  to  carry out any scheme would have  to be on such a   scale as to meet the maximum strain to  which it  might  be  subjected.  In the Post   Office  Savings  Bank  this would  no doubt  be most expensive  and almost certainly   unprofitable.   In  general, the  expense of administering  a scheme would not justify   its adoption.       The previous scheme referred to above was one by which the balance of a mans   deferred pay  (a&apos;ter  he  had  received a  cash advance  which  at discretion of  his   Commanding Officer might be as  much as 3L;  was lodged in the Post Office Savings   Bank.   If the amount to be invested, added to any deposit already  standing  in the   mans name, exceeded the maximum  allowed by the Post Office, the excess was to be   paid to the man by cheque or Post Office order, sent to his place of residence.  It was   introduced on the 1st July, 1893, and lasted till 30th November, 1901.       In July 1894 the Post Office  communicated  to  the War  Office the results  of one   year&apos;s working of the system; 68 to 72  per cent, of the money had been withdrawn   almost immediately, only about 9 per cent, remained in at the  end of three months and   about 3 per cent, for a year (whereas the ordinary depositor leaves about 70 per cent.   of his deposits for a full twelve months).   The  Post Office wanted to bring the system   to an end  at this time, but  the War Office decided to give it  a five  years&apos; trial, but   modified the earlier arrangements by a system by which a sum not exceeding 51. was   sent as ready money to the man.   The figures during  the period the system was in   force were as follows : 	j - -&apos;,-Deposited.	Withdrawn.July 1, 1893-March 31, 1894 189 4-95 1895-96 1896-97 1897-98 1898-99 * 1899-1900 Total	  286,146 424,923 328,446 365,871 370,948 376,10! 161,618	  252,273 406.619 322,610 351,294 361,453 362,119 179,633	2,314,053	2,236,001    After the abolition of deferred pay in 1898 the system quickly died out.    The loss to the Post Office on these transactions during the seven years the systemwas m force amounted to  12,442L, which loss was met from Army funds. The Post Office-memorandum on the subject remarks that the system did very little to encourage thrift,and quite possibly the men who left their money in would have placed it there on theirown initiative.    It has, in consequence/been  urged by the War Office Finance  Department  thatapprc)val should only be  given to the present  scheme on the understanding that thePost Office will make no charge against the War Office  should the scheme fail to coverits cost to the Post Office.  .    On the 15th May the War Office Demobilisation Committee came to the conclusion      [899-27]                                                        M
that a system  of payment  of gratuities by  instalments could be  superimposed on thedemobilisation scheme, but that.the benefits likely to accrue from the scheme wouldnot,  so  far as could be seem be sufficient to justify the  setting up  of the elaboratemachinery that would be necessary.

AT the outset of their deliberations  the Committee have  been faced with thenecessity of the creation of a special organisation  to  deal with the re-settlement ofofficers in  civil life.  It is obvious that such an  organisation should be under thecontrol  of  a Department of the Government.  After  full consideration  of possiblealternatives, they are of opinion that an Appointments Board for  officers and men oflike standing (with  the necessary provincial organisation) should be  established, underthe  control of the  Ministry of Labour, to co-operate  with  the  existing UniveisityAppointments Boards and other approved bodies.     We have considered whether officers would feel difficulty in availing themselves offacilities provided  by the  Ministry of Labour.   We do not think  that any suchdifficulty will  in fact be felt if, as we contemplate, a special board is  created to carryout  this work and it is  quite clear  throughout that  the Appointments Board forofficers is entirely separate, both  with regard to premises and staff,  from the Employ-ment Exchanges of the Ministry of  Labour.     2. The Committee are of opinion that the officials of the proposed AppointmentsBoard should, so far as possible, be drawn from among ex-officers.     3. The Committee ha\ e thought it necessary to present  an interim report at thisstage of their proceedings because they feel that it would be useless for the Ministry ofLabour to get into  touch with the various authorities concerned if their work were to
316obe wasted  and the whole  ground covered again.  They are of opinion  that  thenecessary official  organisation should,  so  far  as  possible, be  completed, . and  thatarrangements for  co-operation with the existing bodies concerned  should  be madewithout delay.  The Committee would be grateful, therefore, for an  early decision onthis subject in order that the progress of their deliberations should be impeded as littleas possible.

INTERIM  REPORT   OF  THE  WAR  OFFICE         DEMOBILIZATION  COMMITTEE.PAET   I.                                      Introductory.     1. By way of preface to a record of the progress of the work of the Committee, it may beuseful to make a brief statement of the. steps taken elsewhere to deal with the problems of whichthe return to civil life of  the personnel  of the military forces who will be under arms at the closeof the war is the one that has been referred to this Committee.     2. In January, 1915, by direction of the Prime Minister (Mr. Asquith), the Secretary of theBoard of Trade  and the Secretary of the War Office  prepared, for the  consideration  of theCabinet,  a paper (Appendix A.)  in which they  made  suggestions  intended  to  meet  certaindifficulties likely to be experienced at the conclusion of the war by the release of the large numbersof men serving with the Army and their return to civil life. The suggestions included the paymentof war gratuities, the grant of  furlough with pay and allowances, and the issue of free travellingwarrants from the place of  demobilization to the men&apos;s homes in order to minimize the possibledistress consequent upon the sudden  disbandment of men  having little means and no immediateprospect of earning  money.  In this the precedents of former wars were followed.  The presentwar and the consequent disturbance of peace conditions have been on such a vast scale thatsomething more was thought to be necessary, and  a new feature was  therefore  introduced, viz.,the  addition to  the  above  benefits  of a  free  insurance  against  unemployment.   Also  thecomparatively recent introduction of the Labour Exchanges, Territorial Force Associations andsimilar organizations  led to the suggestion that use should be made of these for  fitting themen into suitable employment, and a  scheme was  framed for effecting  this.  The  proposalsreceived a provisional approval  by the late Government, hut, in view of the paramount necessityof secrecy, they were ordered to be pigeon-holed for the time being.     3. Later the Government appointed  a Committee of Cabinet Ministers4 called the Recon-struction  Committee which was told to find solutions  for the various problems, in regard to there-settlement of the nation,  which  were likely to arise after the war.  This Committee appointed,in its  turn, an  Army Demobilization  Sub-Committee,  under the Chairmanship of  Mr.  E.  S.Montagu, M.P.,  consisting of representatives of the Departments of State concerned and of otherinterests  involved, such  as labour,  shipping, railways,  &amp;c.  This  sub-committee commencedtheir work by consideration of the proposals referred to   above,  and  in the  main  endorsedthem.  They asked that those proposals requiring Treasury sanction should be taken up depart-mentally and put to that department for approval as early as possible.  This has been done on WarOffice paper No. 121/8600,  and  the Treasury still have  before them the recommendations putto them  by the  Army Council  as the result of the  decision  on  the subject at their  196thmeeting.  These are briefly :          (a.) Each soldier to be  granted a furlough with  pay, separation allowances, &amp;c,  of               4 weeks from the date of being demobilized.         (b.) A railway warrant  to his home.         (c.) A 12 months&apos; policy of insurance against unemployment with benefit  at the rate of               10s. a week for 20 weeks reckoning from  the  expiration of  1 month from the              date of cessation of the furlough  under  (a.).   Also the Civil Liabilities Committee              should be kept in being, in  order to assist non-insurable cases, e.g., shop-keepers,              professional  men, &amp;c.         (d.) A money gratuity (in addition to the ordinary service  gratuity  which is at the              rate of 11. a  year) to  be given to men  who  have served in a sphere of  active              operations, reserving for further consideration the question of giving any gratuity              to men who have not so served.     4. Mr. Montagus Sub-Committee also  discussed briefly the rate at which the armies couldreturn officers and men to civil  life, and the plan on which, in the nations interests, the order ofreturn should be determined.   In regard to  the  latter, the  choice  appeared  to  be between,on the one hand, return  by military formations  in the order prescribed by military needs, and,on the other, return  of  individuals grouped according to civil occupations, the occupationalgroups being arranged in  order,  which would  he determined by trade needs  at the time ofdemobilization.     5. While this discussion was in progress a War Office Committee, under the  Chairmanship ofthe Deputy Quartermaster-General (Major-General Sir C. E. Heath),fwas considering the questionof the allocation of storage accommodation to be used for the mass of equipment and stores ofall kinds which  would be .on the hands of the  Military Authorities  at the conclusion of peace, jand  this Committee was endeavouring to secure some decision as to the plan of demobilization of-* The Committee has since been re-constituted.    t Now under the Chairmanship of Major-General Sir C. Hadden.     (4751)                                                                       A3     -
the personnel, without which decision they felt they were unable to deal adequately with theReference assigned to them.   They failed &quot;to secure this decision, and the Montagu Committeebecoming at  the  same time insistent that  a War Office plan for  disbandment should be placedbefore them the  War Office  Demobilization Committee was appointed &quot;to consider questionsrequiring  settlement in connection  with  the  demobilization of the Army, in  so  far  as  theywould fall within the province of the War Department; to act as a link with the Sub-Committeeof the Reconstruction Committee and to prepare a draft scheme of demobilization.&quot;                       GENERAL QUESTIONS AFFECTING DEMOBILIZATION.     6. Before submitting their recommendations on this Reference, the Committee wish to make certain representations to  the Council on the general question of the measures involved in, and necessitated by, demobilization.     7. They have regarded their Reference primarily in the light of  the immediate circumstances attending the appointment of the Committee.  The War Office not being prepared with a detailed scheme of demobilization, the Montagu Sub-Committee presented an interim report, in which they were moved by the War Office representatives*  to  make an effort  to secure guidance from the Government.  This guidance  the  Government were not in a position to give; they said that the question was to be deferred,  and that &quot; the War  Office was to prepare, as soon as possible, a scheme for the return of one million men from France and their demobilization.&quot;     8. As will be shown in Part II. of this report, the Committee have endeavoured  to  comply with this instruction.   In the course  of their work they have, however, been  confronted with several problems which, though  they are not problems of disbandment of personnel, yet both directly and indirectly affect the speed with which the disbandment can he effected.     9. The more important of these problems they have caused to he stated on separate papers for consideration by the Council and the Government.   Amongst them are:            (1.) There-organization of the Army.   (122/12.)           (2.)  The return of the Dominion Contingents.  (122/9.)           (3.) The definition of  such terms as &quot;duration of the war&quot; &quot; duration of hostilities,&quot;                 &amp;c, in regard to                    (a.) The terms of service of the officers and men.                   (b.) The  special  powers exercised for purposes of the war under the Army                          Act, Defence of the Realm Act, and similar statutes.  (o/Bills/1475.)           (4.)  The selection of  stores and  equipment which it  will be necessary to keep for                 immediate or prospective military purposes, and           (5.)  The disposal of surplus  stores, equipment, &amp;c, for which there will probably be a                 general market.   (122/14.)           (6.)  The disposal of property for which  there will be special markets, such as                    (a.) Motor Transport.  (122/2.)                   (b.) Horses.  (HG/Gen. No./6316.)                   (c.) Land and Buildings.  (Gen. No. 8/653.)           (7.)  The storage of munitions and war equipment which it will be necessary to retain                for immediate or prospective military purposes, and           (8.)  The temporary storage and  safe-keeping of property  such as  that under (o)                and (6).  (Gen. No./12/I08.)     10. All these problems affect, or  may affect, the disbandment of the personnel.   Cadres ofunits and establishments will  have to be held back to  safeguard and handle stores, equipment,horses, &amp;c, until they can be stored or disposed of;  for members of these cadres, and perhaps forothers, the  &quot; duration of the war&quot;  will have to be specially defined by statute, a definition whichwill  be required also  for  other purposes.!   Any men and stores  thus retained will, of course,absorb accommodation which would otherwise be released for other  purposes, e.g., in  connectionwith the preparation  of the reliefs required  to  set  free the foreign  garrisons of Territorial andDominion troops.                                       CO-ORDINATION.     11. Most of these questions should come eventually to Mr. Montagu&apos;s  Sub-Committee forco-ordination with other questions,  affecting the  re-settlement  after  the  war, which  other Departments  of State will raise in their turn, and the decision in  regard to these will probably have to be given by  the  Government itself on the recommendation of that  Sub-Cornmittee. In  all  the  above questions  the War Office  should  take  the   initiative  in formulating proposals, and the present Committee wish  to  submit that some  authority in the War Office  preferably the Committee itself-should collect and co-ordinate all that the&quot;War Office has to  say on these subjects, and submit them in  due course, and from time to time to the Council.  This is so far as investigation and the framing of schemes are concerned.    * The bearing of such a decision on any plan for demobilization will appear later.    t The selection of the non-commissioned officers and men for these cadres, and also for the purpose of safe-guarding stores held on charge of departments, may have to be settled by other means, as, for example, calling forvolunteers and, if necessary, offering special terms.
                                      ADMINISTRATION.    12. The execution of the plans which the Council or the Government may order should beentrusted, so far as this work falls to the Military Authorities, to a separate Directorate with aspecially appointed staff, and the Committee recommend that the  nucleus of this organizationshould be set up at once.  The head of it should  be a member of this Committee, and we believeit Avill be  of  great  advantage  if  the Committee&apos;s  Secretary  be appointed  to be a  member-of  the  branch,  the staff of which should, they suggest, be,  as far as  possible^ kept to thework till  it is  finished.  As it is most probable that mobilization and demobilization questionswitl frequently have to be considered together after the war, it is suggested that the MobilizationDirectorate be re-established, sub-divided  in  two branches,  one for  mobilization and one  fordemobilization.  As soon as  final approval of the scheme to be adopted for the disbandment ofthe  personnel  has been  given, this Directorate will be  required  in conjunction  with otherDirectorates to compile and  issue the  necessary detailed instructions,  arrange  for the selectionand appointment of the staffs required to carry out those instructions, and see to the printing anddistribution of the necessary forms.    13. The disbandment of the officers and men, which, under the scheme put forward in Part II. ofthis Report, is planned so as to meet civilian requirements as to trade, &amp;c, will nevertheless be amilitary operation, and will be carried out by the Military Authorities, and under military discipline.The selection of the equipment, stores, &amp;c, for retention  for military purposes should also be inthe hands of the Military Authorities ; but the Committee express the hope that the Governmentwill set up a separate organization for the disposal by sale, destruction, &amp;c, of the surplus and-convertible property  of all  sortss   This is mainly a civilian business.   It will be of very greatmagnitude and complexity, and the relatively small professional  army of officers and soldiers towhich the present military forces may be expected  to  shrink, with  all the rapidity  that publicopinion will demand, will be quite unequal to its successful exploitation.  Moreover, the professionalsoldiers will have their hands quite full enough  with the work of re-making the Army.   At thesame time, the inclusion in  such an organization of some military element, especially  of  whatmay be called the technical  branches, will be advisable, if not indeed essential.    14. Further, it will, of  course,  be  for the  Government through some Civil Department todeclare the order in which men of the various industries are to be released, and Avithin the limitsof the available machinery to determine the pace at which disbandment is to proceed.   A  ciAdlianorganization will also be responsible for the distribution of the demobilized soldiers according tothe national requirements.                                      PUBLICITY.    15. A great deal  of  the success of  any scheme that is  adopted will depend upon  the mannerin Avhich it is announced and explained to the public, and the Committee trust that when  the time-comes* the  Government Avill  see  that this  is done, either  by speeches in Parliament, or byexplanations to  editors  of  newspapers, or by  communications to  the Press,  or by all thesemethods.  They hope also that at  the  same time the  Government will  restrain the ardour ofLocal Authorities who may seek to give vent to local gratitude and enthusiasm by  endeavoursduring the process of demobilization to organize public receptions of the returning troops.   Suchefforts if unchecked may lead to demands that local units shall be brought home in such  an orderor  be kept  in  being  in  such a way as to facilitate the public receptions, thereby dislocating thenecessarily someAvhat elaborate  plans  for re-settling the  men  in  accordance with  the tradenecessities of the moment.    Opportunities will offer,  or can he made, later for such parades or ceremonies as may be calledfor by local public opinion or national sentiment.                                      LIQUOR CONTROL.    16. Another condition of orderly and speedy re-constitution of the nation Avould appear to thisCommittee to be the denial to the returning soldiers and their friends  of unrestricted opportunitiesof obtaining drink, and the Committee  venture to suggest,  though perhaps the matter does notstrictly come within their Reference, that the present or  even greater  restriction of the  sale ofliquor should be maintained for some months after the commencement of demobilization.                                  GENERAL  ASSUMPTIONS.    17. In framing the scheme which is set forth in Part II.  of this Report the Committee havemade certain assumptions, Avkich, though they do not affect the scheme as a scheme, yet have  ahearing on its execution.    18. First they assume that, Avhen the time comes, the stream of return to civil life will  nothe allowed to flOAv more rapidly from the armies at home than from those in France.  This wouldremove any risk of complaints that the fighting men Avere having jobs snatched from them by the&quot; stay-at-homes.&quot; Complaints of this kind might lead to dislocation of plans at the last moment andconsequent diminution in the rate of demobilization.  If,  hoAvever, there is sufficient intervalbetween the date when overt acts Avith a vieAv to demobilization become possible, and the dateAvhen demobilization can actually begin, steps are to be taken to mark down the  men  for Avhorathere is work waiting at the  time as ascertained by references both to  men and employers, then.   * It would serve a useful purpose if the Government could publish at least the outlines of the scheme as son asit is approved-provided, of course, this be done in such a way as not to mislead our Allies.
in regard to such men there  should arise no objections to any inequality in the rate of return to-civil life as between those on  the two sides of the Channel.     19.  Again,  the Committee are calculating  upon the  men being  allowed to  retain theiruniforms until  they reach their homes.   To make them change to civilian clothing: before theyleave  their  final&apos; military stations  would  not be  practicable.   Moreover,  the  bulk  of  themen would probably not  wear the sort of civilian suits that alone  could  be provided.  TheCommittee recognize that points of considerable importance are involved in this question.  Forinstance, disciplinary cases  of some difficulty for both the military  and  police authorities mayarise out of breaches of the peace,  &amp;c,  committed by disbanded soldiers  still wearing uniform.This appears to be a danger of which the country can run the  risk for  the comparatively shorttime of the life of the imiforms, even  supposing the men are  not  required to return them.  Toprevent loss to the State,  however, it  may be necessary to order the eventual surrender  of theuniforms.  For this a somewhat elaborate organization would have to be set up.  It is suggestedthat a separate  sub-committee be  appointed with a view  to  making  recommendations on thissubject.  Meanwhile the Committee assume that the men will go to their homes in their uniforms.     20.  We have assumed that until peace be assured no  man at home or abroad will be released,with possible comparatively minor exceptions as shown later, and we have made no allowance forthe retention abroad after that date of any army of occupation.  It is possible that with the greatvariety of  interests involved in the present war  some longer time than  after  previous  wars willelapse between  the first  stage of movements towards peace  and its  conclusion.  At any rate,it seems not unreasonable to  expect  an  armistice of 3 months  or more.*   Without  anyappearance of an intention to demobilize, which might he misunderstood, a good deal is to-be doneunder the scheme by way  of preparation for demobilization, but it seems clear that unless there bean armistice of at least 3 months the collection, collation and tabulation of the informationf whichthe Employment Department  of the Ministry of Labour will  undertake, with a view to ascer-taining the extent to  which  employers  can take back their former workmen  out  of the  Army,cannot be  carried out.  The  scheme submitted in Part II. of this Report does not, however,depend on this process being completed.   During an armistice  it may be possible to hold up  inthis  country all reinforcements for theatres  of war, and possibly recruiting will be allowed  todie down.  At the same  time normal wastage  will  be  going on.  and  perhaps  some specialcategories of men, such as  police  and essential men for transport services, can be disbanded  inadvance.  But  no more seems possible regard being had to the magnitude and complexity of theissues involved and the danger of undue confidence that the enemy will adhere to engagementswhich he may see advantage in abandoning.    21.  When peace is assured the scheme contemplates that, with the exception of cadres of unitsrequired to handle and safeguard stores, care for horses, &amp;c,  the  whole  of the military forces,at  any  rate in  France  and  at home,  will be  at  once resolved into a mass of  individuals.The military formations will become attenuated, except in the cases of armies in the more distanttheatres, where  for  demobilization purposes nothiug is to  be  gained by not retaining intact themilitary formations until their disbandment at home.   But if, after peace, an army of occupation isrequired, the  scheme may require modification, though it can still be applied to suoh portions ofthe Army as can be released from the main theatre of operations.   The selection of the units tohe retained for the army of occupation and the decision as to their composition will not be easy andmay delay demobilization considerably.    The  Committee, however, have not  dealt with thiscontingency.   They assume an armistice followed by peace.    22. An armistice, however, while it  would be of the greatest advantage  is not essential tothe effectual prosecution of  the scheme. . The Committee have suggested two methods  ofprocedure ; the first of these can be put into execution immediately peace is declared even shouldthere be  no interval between the conclusion of hostilities and the ratification of  a definitive treatyof peace.  The second method can be carried into effect if there be an armistice of at least threeweeks; while if  three months can  be  spent in  preparation the procedure of the EmploymentDepartment can be  superimposed on the scheme of procedure  proposed by the Committee.  Ingeneral,  the  longer the  period between the  cessation  of  hostilities and  the conclusion  ofpeace, the greater the precision will be with which the national requirements can be met.    23. It has also been  assumed by the Committee that the rail  and port  facilities now afforded usby the French Government will at least not be curtailed.                                    General Principles.    24. Before describing the scheme in  detail  it may be as well to  set  forth briefly the mainprinciples on which it is framed.    25. The Committee  have  based their scheme on the idea that the selection of  the menfor return and the rate of disbandment are to be  governed  by the requirements of the nationas a whole, from.the point of view of the  principal industries and  the maintenance of services ofpublic utility, and not by the wishes or even necessities  of the individual.  Nor have theybuilt  their plan on  any consideration that classes or groups of soldiers  have prior claims to   * For what they are worth the following are some modern precedents :-The campaign of 1814 was fought up tothe very last, the battle of Toulouse actually occurring after Napoleon had abdicated.  In the Anglo-Boer War therewas no armistice proper, and fighting continued during the negotiations that led to the Peace of Vereeniging.  In theEusso-Japanese War the Treaty of  Portsmouth was signed several days  before the cessation of hostilities inManchuria, and the Turco-Italian War, 1912, affords another modern instance of  peace negotiations being carried onwhil^ hostilities continued.  On the other hand the armistice in the Franco-German War Listed 3i months  in the-Greco-Turkish War, 1897, (i  months ; in the Spanish-American War, 1898, 4 months.   t The details are to be found in Appendix A.

Agricultural labourers will  come  home  first, if  the Government  so  order, whether they are Regulars, Territorials or New Army men, or whether they were early  or late voluntary recruits or conscripts.  Nor have they thought it necessary for them to make  any special provision for hard individual cases.  The  Committee feel that  concessions in such cases should be discouraged as much as possible.  Nothing but adherence to broad, general principles, justified by the national necessities, seems likely to allay private dissatisfactions.     26. As stated above, the military formations in the distant theatres of war can best be brought home  as formations.  Elsewhere, ie..  at home and  in France, the Armies will retain  cadres only of units, for which cadres  establishments will have been drawn up previously (see  W.O. paper No.  122/18), and the rest of the men will be considered as a mass of individuals.  These will he dealt with by occupations and trades  and will  be sent back  to civil life  in trade groups, in the order dictated  by  the  Government according to  trade  and   labour  requirements  at the time.  Steps have already been taken (Army Order 93 of 1st March, 1917) in conjunction with the  Employment  Department  to secure that each man shall   have his  occupation and- trade  marked on a document  in his possession, and that full instructions and returns shall be compiled  on  which those  officers  and  others  can  work who  will have  to direct the flow of the  returning soldiers.   Certain stations  scattered  throughout  the  United  Kingdom have been  selected as  &quot;Dispersal Stations&quot; through which the  men will pass back to their homes, and  these stations (mostly hutted  camps) will  be fed, so  far  as France is concerned, through  selected ports on  both  sides  of the   channel.  The ports   on the  other  side will be linked up to certain railheads or  &quot; funnel-heads&quot; which will  be  established at  points at a convenient distance behind  the main  Armies.   Between the Armies and  these funnel heads  the process of  sorting  the  men  into  their occupational  groups  and  according  to their final  destinations, i.e., their Dispersal  Stations, will  be effected through a  number  of Reception Camps.   This sorting out  must be done at some stage, and if troublesome  cross- journeyings are to be  avoided  it should be taken  in hand at  the earliest * stage possible. The Committee  have discussed  this matter at some length  amongst  themselves and with the British Military Authorities in France.     27. The procedure at the Dispersal Stations is to be simple, so as to maintain as rapid a stream of disbandment as possible.* The exact rate at which the outflow can proceed cannot be estimated, except approximately, because without experience it is not easy to ascertain where along the channel leading  from the armies to  the  men&apos;s homes the &quot; bottle-neck &quot; wall be found.  On this question  of the pace at which disbandment is to be effected the Committee  have no knowledge of the numbers the  country will be  able to digest when the time comes,  and they have attempted merely to indicate, approximately, the maximum strain which the scheme is capable of bearing.     28. The cadres will not  all he left to the last, as transport arrangements can be made  which will secure that they will return gradually during  the demobilization of  the individuals.     29. The Committee have endeavoured to make the scheme elastic.  At the same time it must be realized that the rapidity with which the men can be returned to their homes will vary with the extent to which  the  scheme is  called upon  to meet particular rather than general  demands. As much  notice as possible should be given to  the Military Authorities of the scheme finally approved by the Government, and of any variations  of it.    30. As  stated in  paragraph 9  above, the Committee  have made proposals elsewhere (W.O. paper No. 122/14) for the  early consideration of plans for dealing with the mass of  stores and  equipment Avhich will be in  possession of the  Military Authorities at the  end of the war. The  question affects the problem of the re-settlement of the man-power of the nation in several ways.  The  amount of the stores alone will  lock up a large number  of men probably  many thousands until final disposal has been effected, which may not be  for some time.  Many of the stores  again will be  of value and of a  technical character, and  the  men to  be retained will contain a fairly large number of skilled  men.  It  seems  as if the nation may have to choose between  delay in the return of  valuable labour and somewhat summary disposal  of valuable property.    31. The procedure  proposed by the Committee for demobilization  has been considered by a similar Committee of the Staff in France, and conferences have taken place between representatives of the two  bodies, which are maintaining close touch in the  detailed working out of the plans. Formal concurrence has been given by the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief the British Armies in France, and the Field-Marshal Commauding-in-Chief Home Forces. In drawing up  the scheme the Committee have also had the advantage of  advice from the   Director of Transports and Shipping,  Officers i/c Army Service Corps Records, Royal  Horse and Royal  Field  Artillery Records, Royal Engineers Records, Infantry Records, Hounslow; Infantry Records, Shrewsbury ; Infantry Records, Lichfield.                                 Settlement of Pay, &amp;o.    32. The Committee are informed by the Paymaster-iu-Chief, who is a member of this body,that  a plan  for  ensuring early  settlement of the men&apos;s  balances  of  pay is being  arranged. The  Committee&apos;s scheme for the release of the  men contemplates this settlement taking place during the furlough period, and they venture to point out that the ascertainment of the balancesand the payment within a  comparatively  short period for such large numbers as will  have to be dealt with will  mean the retention of fairly large  numbers of trained clerks, both military and   * It is anticipated that each party of men for demobilization will pass through the Dispersal Station within-24 hours.
civilian.  In  reference to this point the Committee would draw attention to the  difficulties-experienced at the end of the South African War, and to the delays in payment which, thoughthey were unavoidable owing to incompleteness of records, were the subject of much complaint.Thus it would be better in the Committee&apos;s opinion to over-staff the Pay Offices than to under-staff them.                                        OFFICERS.    33. The demobilization of officers has not yet been fully considered by the Committee.  Thescheme in Part II contemplates the return of officers Avith each detachment as conducting officers.Thus officers will return to civil  life as part of the main stream of demobilization.  There will,.however, be some to be left with the cadres.   A large number of Regular officers will be set atliberty by the reduction of Staffs.  As regards the final release of  the officers who come homewith the detachments steps should be taken to avoid unnecessary delay in gazetting them out,notwithstanding  the large numbers involved and the rapidity with which, it is hoped, they willreturn.                                        WOMEN.    34. Since the  Committee drew up their scheme the Military Authorities have been sendingwomen to France in increased numbers.  The  Committee have not had time to consider whetherany, and if so what, special arrangements will have to be made for their return.  At present theyare disposed to  recommend that this question may be deferred until it is  seen whether thenumbers involved are so large as to make it necessary to frame any special scheme.                                    MEN IN HOSPITAL.    35. As regards the hospital population at home, when demobilization  commences certaindifficult problems will  arise, as  pressure will doubtless  be brought to bear on the War Office to-clear out many  of the buildings lent by  public authorities and private  persons,  or hired  forpurposes of accommodating the sick  and convalescent.  The Committee  consider that thedemobilization of the  sick and wounded cannot  be  brought within  any general scheme ofdemobilization such as they have proposed, as it  presents certain special problems which shouldbe worked out separately.                              COLOURED  LABOUR  BATTALIONS.    36. The Committee have not considered the disposal of the coloured Labour Battalions at theend of the war.  These units have practically no equipment or stores to hamper their movements^and repatriation is a question of  transport and available shipping.
PART  II.SCHEME  OF DEMOBILIZATION.     1, The order in Avhich various categories of men are selected for release from the Army must be settled for the most part in accordance with considerations other than military ; in particular, the economic need  of the country and the necessity for returning men to civil life as quickly as possible.  It  will therefore not meet the case to demobilize (except to a limited  extent) by military formations and  units, since,  when complete  with  their  transport  and  regimental equipment, these can only be transported and dealt with at a very limited rate; moreover, the men would then  be returned to civil life  indiscriminately, without regard to the fundamental trades required first.     2.  It is therefore proposed to  draft  men  out  of their units by  detachments and to transport them to their homes as rapidly as possible.   The units would thus be depleted until only skeleton units, or cadres, would remain, with sufficient personnel  for assisting with the transportation of their regimental equipment and transport and for handing in at the storage depots in  the  United Kingdom.  These cadres would be dealt with separately, as explained in paragraph 16 below, the men retained  till last being those least required by the country.  It is estimated  that about two-thirds the strength of the  Army on the Continent might be returned  home as  drafts of individuals, and that a sufficient proportion of officers for demobilization coxdd be released from their units concurrently to act as Draft.  Conducting Officers.  As  soon as their drafts have been disposed of these officers would proceed to their homes  and be dealt with  under the scheme for the demobilization of officers.     3. In selecting  these detachments, priority should be given to :          (a.)  Men of certain &quot; industrial groups &quot;  of immediate national importance.   These               &quot;industrial groups&quot; have been specified by the Employment Department.         (b.)  Men whose employment on leaving the Army is guaranteed to them. and on financial grounds :          (c.)  Married men.         (d.)  Artificers  and  men  of skilled trades  enlisted at special rates before the Military               Service Act came into force.     Under the scheme proposed the  priority with regard to  these  classes need not be specified until demobilization takes  place.     4. Detachments of men  as required would be  selected from their units as above, and  sent in conducted parties with only their arms and  personal  equipment to &quot;Dispersal  Stations&quot; (hutted camps in  most cases)  as  shown  on attached map.  There might  be 24 Dispersal Stations, asfollows: Stirling.Glen corse.Gailes.Frees Heath.Oswestry.Ripon.Clipstone.Grantham.Rugeley.Chiseldon.Weymouth.Winchester.Colchester.Warley.Randalstown.Curragh.Ballyvonare.*Halton ParkfSeafordWoolwich1&quot;R.H.For London Territorials and men. proceeding  to the  Counties  of London, Middlesex,  Surrey, Sussex and Kent, and also, in the  event of Method A  of paragraph 9 being  adopted, for the Guards, Machine-Gun and  Cyclist Corps.  and R.F.                 Artillery         for\A.O.C.Dover for R.G. Artillery            ^j- Engineers            &apos;R.F.C.Chatham       forAldershotforShoreham (re A.S.C. R.A.M.C. A.V.C.ief Dispersal Station).These are suggested as special  Dispersal Stations for men of  these corps from the Conti-  nent.     5. If the suggestions proposed are adopted, full boat and train loads for these stations could readily be arranged, and at the same time economy in administration would be effected by dealing with the men at a limited number of centres, there being sufficient, however, to avoid congestion even if the total number of discharges per diem amounted to 40.000 or more.J     As soon as peace is declared sufficient men stationed at these Dispersal Statiuns might be selected in accordance with paragraph  3 and discharged on the spot by the procedure indicated in    * Halton Park for men stationed in London, Middlesex, Berkshire, Gloucestershire, and all counties north of the* Thames.    t Seaford  for men from  the Continent, also for those from Cornwall, Devonshire, Somersetshire, Wiltshire, Dorsetshire, Hampshire, Surrey, Sussex and Kent.

                Method. A.(To be adopted if a period of at  least three  weeks  cannot be  guaranteed  for preparation vide  paragraph 19.)        .  .  The folloAving is an outline of the procedureto be adopted under Method A  :                   I. HOME. .  Yviih regard to detachments  to be Avithdrawnfrom units at home:   (a.) In order that units may  be able to detailmen of the classes required without delay, andto minimise the danger of misrepresentation, an                 Method B.(To be adopted if a period of  at least three weeks  can  be   guaranteed   for   preparation vide  paragraph 19.)  The following is an outline of the procedureto be adopted under Method  B:                   I. HOME.  With regard to detachments to be withdraAvnfrom units at home :   (a.) (i.) In order that units may  be able  todetail men  of  the classes  required  Avithoutdelay, and  to minimise  the danger  of  mis-    * In the case of units quartered at large military stations, it is for consideration whether men should be sentdiiect to their homes from these stations, temporary storage being provided at the stations for receipt of their armsnud equipment, which would be sent by cousignments to the main store allotted for the purpose.  This wouldvirtually be the same as adding to the Dispersal Stations given in paragraph 4.  If this is not desirable, these menmight still hand in their arms and equipment at their stations  and then proceed in detachments to the appropriateDispersal Stations, and this might be done with advantage if  method &quot; B &quot; of paragraph 9 were adopted for troopsat home, i                                     &quot;                                            1 paragraphs 11 (e) and 12, and these would then proceed direct to their homes, or alternatively they might be sent  on  leave, if it is desired not to discharge men- at home first, thus in either case such accommodation as may  be required for demobilization purposes would be vacated.     6.  It is suggested that men withdrawn from units&apos;at home as well as on the Continent should pass through the Dispersal Stations specified above, so that the men with their arms and personal equipment would travel together  in conducted parties to their local centre.  This would simplify the discharge procedure  and effect economy in the staffs for dealing with the  men&apos;s arms and equipments     7.  The return of men  from overseas to the Dispersal Stations would be effected through Reception Camps at the troop railheads feeding the various Continental ports,  of which it is assumed four or five would be available for this purpose.  Camps will probably also be  required at these ports so as  to regulate the flow of men to the  rate required, and so avoid delays  in shipping.     Men Avould be sent from each Continental port to  one or more  British ports, each of which ,would feed only certain Dispersal  Stations, zoned on that port.     An example showing how this might be arranged is given on the attached  map; although this indicates approximately the present position of the  armies, the system could be adapted  to almost any situation.     This entails the various armies sending detachments via the appropriate lines of communication- according to the pOrt of departure allotted to feed the Dispersal Station to which that detachment is proceeding.   This would involve a certain amount of marching, &apos;bus, or lateral  railway journey at the start, and it is not  possible to determine the amount of this until the position of  the armies on demobilization is knoAvn.  This  sorting being done  near the front, arrangements would be simplified as the detachments would be started on well-defined through routes to their destinations and subsequent cross journeys would be avoided, and it would enable demobilization to be carried out as rapidly as possible.     8. Taking  an assumed average daily rate of demobilization of 20,000, withdrawn in  any desired proportion from  units either in this country or  abroad, this would mean  that each Dispersal Station in the denser areas of Great Britain might have to  deal with  1,000 men on an average each 24  hours,  Avhile in  the lighter districts  the number  Avould be, say, 800, and  in Ireland  only  about 300.  It is  estimated that  20,000 men  per day may be sent from the Continent alone,  and  that a  similar number  may be  demobilized  from those  stationed  in the United Kingdom, so that tA\Tice the above rates will probably have to be worked to, but the organization of the Dispersal Stations should be sufficiently  elastic to  be capable  of  being- expanded, as it may be found that Avith experience the average daily rate  of demobilization can be considerably increased.     The decision  arrived at by the  Government  as  to the order of-priority  of the variousindustrial groups or other categories [see pai-agraph 3) and as to the proportion of each  category required Avould be communicated to the. D.A.G., Base, and to Home Commands by the War Office. The War Office would state the number to be sent daily to  each Dispersal Station, so that thenumbers arriving each day could be regulated.     9. The Committee has considered two alternative methods of carrying out the selection and return of men in  the  order required, namely, (A) based on military districts, and (B)  based on areas to Avhich the men desire to proceed on demobilization.   Under method A  each man would be sent to the Dispersal Station allotted to the Military District  of the regiment in which  he  is serving at the time of demobilization irrespective of the place to Avhich he desires to proceed on demobilization or of the  regiment in Avhich he originally  enlisted.  For  example, detachmentsfrom  the  Suffolk Regiment  Avould  be sent  to the Dispersal Station at  Colchester.   UnderMethod B each man  Avould be sent to the Dispersal Station allotted to feed the area in Avhich hewishes to proceed  on demobilization, irrespective of the  regiment in which he Avas serving ondemobilization, except in the case  of men returning from overseas who belong  to the variousCorps for Avhich special Dispersal Stations are suggested in paragraph 4.

The  Higher  Command  in  France  towhich each unit belongs.  (c.)  (i.)  On  demobilization   the   D.A.G.,3rd  Echelon,  receiving  his  instructions fromtime to time from the War Office, would instructthe Higher Commands of the numbers per diemand of the  Dispersal Stations  through whichmen of various units are to  be  sent accordingto their Military  District or its  Sub-Division,the priority of the class of men required beingstated  as indicated in paragraph 3 above to beat  certain  reception camps  on  certain dates.Armies would allot the numbers in  the  properproportion to their lower formations until unitsreceived their daily allotment.  (ii.)  These instructions would be passed bythe Higher Commands  through the subordinateformations to the  units.  (iii.) The O.C. unit having prepared a list ofhis  men by  &quot; Industrial Groups &quot; would detailmen of the required type as far as possible, theremainder of the  men  to complete  the  draftbeing selected at his discretion.areas and &quot; Industrial Groups.&apos;&apos;  The referencenumber for each man&apos;s area can be ascertainedby means of a handbook which is being pre-pared showing this information for every railwaystation in the United Kingdom.

A similar chain of commands could bearranged for Lines of Communication Units.    ]0. These methods, so far as units overseas are concerned, have been considered with specialreference to France.  It is a matter for consideration how far the same principle could be adoptedfor troops returning from other theatres of war.    11. (a.) Before leaving his unit, each man would be provided with his Dispersal Certificate(Appendix C), which would be made out in duplicate.* Timely notice&apos; will be given of any impending change in these instructions.
* Should ifc be necessary to charge the man for any deficiencies, this can be effected at the final settlement.  ..  The following information would be entered therein:       (i.) Number, Rank, Name, Unit.      ii.) Whether for Discharge, Disembodiment, Transfer to the Reserve, or Leave on extension           of Service.     (iii.) Home Address.     (iv.) Railway Station to which he desires to proceed from his Dispersal Station.      (v.) Reference No. of area to which he will proceed.     (vi.) &quot; Industrial Group &quot; No.    (vii.) Articles of equipment and clothing which the man is responsible for handing in at the           . Dispersal Station.*    The certificate to  be signed  by the Soldier  and by the Officer Commanding the Unit or anOfficer deputed  by him.  One copy will be carried by the man and the other by the Officerconducting the draft of which the man forms part.    (b.)  (i.) Each detachment from units serving at home would be sent to its Dispersal Station.    (ii.)  Each detachment from the Continent would proceed to its Reception Camp, and wouldhe shipped thence to England and sent to the corresponding Dispersal Station.    (c.)  On arrival at the Dispersal Station each man would:       (i.)  Hand  in  his arms  and equipment,   and   produce  his  Dispersal  Certificate  (see            paragraph 11 (a).)     (ii.) Receive a railway ticket.    (iii.) Hand in his A.B. 64 (Active Service Pay Book).    (iv.) Receive an advance of pay.     (v.) Receive a &quot; Protection Certificate &quot; in exchange for his Dispersal Certificate.    (vi.) Be marched as one of a party to the station, and  entrain to  his final destination, being           given 28 days&apos; furlough.    12. A copy of the  proposed form of &quot; Protection Certificate &quot; is attached (Appendix  D).  Thiscertificate will be made out in quadruplicate :      1 copy for the soldier.    1 copy to be forwarded to the man&apos;s Record Office.    1 copy to be forwarded to the man&apos;s Pay Office, together with his A.B. 64.    l:copy to remain as a record for the Officer Commanding Dispersal Station.    Orders would have to be  issued  impressing on Officers Commanding Dispersal Stations theimportance of safeguarding all blank copies of Protection Certificates.    13. In the case of men from overseas, the Commandant of the Reception Camp should compilea list of men by units, despatched  each day, and send it to  the  D.A.G. Base.  As each list isreceived, the Base Record Office would forward the A.F.&apos;s B 103 of the men named to the RecordOffices concerned.    14. No certificate need be signed by the soldier before receiving his final discharge to theeffect that he has no claim on the  Government.    The man would eventually receive  his  discharge certificate (or corresponding document inthe case of disembodiment or transfer to the Reserve) and balance of pay through the post, but inthe meantime he should retain his Protection Certificate.    The suggested Form of Discharge Certificate is attached  (Appendix  E).  The DischargingOfficer would be the Officer i/c Records.    15. It is  desirable that the  Staffsrat the Dispersal Stations be  as  simple and uniform aspossible,  consistent with the performance of the operations outlined in paragraph 11.    Thus the Pay Department might  have representatives at each camp to  take charge of thecopies of the Protection Certificate, destined for the man&apos;s Pay and Record Offices, and to receivehis A.B. 64.  At each Dispersal Station a staff of the Army Ordnance Department and temporaiystorage would have to  be provided to receive and despatch arms and personal equipment to themain store depots which would be established for the purpose.    1(5.  Simultaneously with the demobilization of personnel, the repatriation of units and cadres,with their own regimental equipment,  can go on.  A unit to-be  retained in the service would besent direct to its Peace Station. Its regular personnel would remain with the unit while the personnelto be disbanded would proceed to their Dispersal Stations.  A unit to be disbanded would be sentto the place in  the United  Kingdom. where  the  equipment is to be stored, for which suitableaccommodation  is to  be  provided.   Its regular personnel would  be sent  to the appropriateDepots or posted to Regular Units, while the personnel to be disbanded would proceed to their
Dispersal Stations.  The first  to  come home would probably be  the units for foreign reliefs-Units and  cadres  could  probably be  brought home through Southampton  at  the  rate of theequivalent  of a division in three days.     In spite of the fact that  no information is as yet forthcoming as to the future army to bemaintained, it is suggested that an opportunity of extending their service should be  offered tosoldiers enlisted for the duration  of the war up to  such numbers as may be approved.   Theyshould be included in the first detachments sent to the United Kingdom, and would be sent totheir homes on furlough.   The fact that they have extended their service should be noted on their&quot;Dispersal Certificates&quot;  before they  leave  their units.   They  would proceed  to  their homesthrough the Dispersal Stations in  the  same manner as men for discharge, and at the  end of their28 days&apos; furlough would join at their Depots, in accordance with instructions given to them ontheir Protection Certificates at the Dispersal Stations.     For  these men a special form of Protection  Certificate would be required,  printed in red,easily distinguishable from those of men who are returning to civil life.  The  copy to be retainedby the man would  contain a warrant for his journey from his home to his depot.  A  specimen ofthe certificate is given in Appendix F.     In the case of a man who has extended his service, the  Officer i/c Records concerned would,on receipt of his copy of the man&apos;s Protection Certificate,  inform the Officer Commanding Depotconcerned as  to the date on which  the man has been ordered to join.     After the foreign relief units,  it is immaterial from the point of view of this scheme, in whatorder units and cadres leave for home.     Any mounted  unit that can be spared should be sent  home  as early as possible  in order to-economise in the shipping of forage.     17. In the case of men who are to be transferred or re-transferred to the  Army Reserve thefollowing procedure would be adopted, whether the man be serving at Home or Overseas      Army Form B  2056 (Proceedings on Transfer) must be completed as  regards paragraphs 1,11, lo and 16, by the Officer Commanding  the unit in which the man is  serving, in accordancewith the arrangements that existed before  the war.     Paragraph 14  or 15 must be completed by the Medical  Officer i/c Unit.     The  man would  then be  sent to the Dispersal Station, and would go through  the  sameprocess of return to civil fife as those taking their final discharge.  His Dispersal Certificate, whichhe would bring with him, would show that he would be for transfer or re-transfer to the ArmyReserve,  and  this  fact would  be communicated  to  the Officer  i/c Records concerned by theDispersal Station.    All pay claims  of men for transfer  or re-transfer to the Army Reserve would be settled directby the Paymaster as in the case of men taking their final discharge.     Army Form B  2056 would be  posted direct by the Officer Commanding unit to the Officer i/cRecords  concerned, who would fill in paragraphs  18  and  19,  and at the  end of the  man&apos;s-furlough would send him  the documents of his transfer or re-transfer to the Army Reserve insteadof sending  him his final  discharge documents.  The Officer i/c Records concerned would he theconfirming  officer.    Army Forms B 2067, B 2088 and D 489 should not be issued on demobilization.     18. All soldiers who are  prisoners of war would, if handed over  by  the enemy to  anExpeditionary Force, be demobilized in the same manner as soldiers of that Expeditionary Force.    For soldiers who may be repatriated direct from  an enemy country, a separate scheme wouldhave to be  devised.  It is thought that one or more Reception Camps  might be established inEngland, near the  port or ports of disembarkation, and that soldier prisoners  of war  repatriateddirect to this country might pass through these, and proceed thence to Dispersal Stations.     The  return  of the  prisoners to  the  various Expeditionary Forces  would  facilitate  theirdemobilization, while  it would also give the best, if not the  only, opportunity  for holding thecourts of enquiry prescribed by paragraph  675 of King&apos;s Regulations.     19. Comparative  merits of Methods  A and B. Owing to the  additional clerical  workinvolved  in Method B, Method A will have to be adopted if the circumstances are such thata period of at least 3 weeks&apos; preparation cannot  be guaranteed before demobilization begins.     The  advantage of Method A is that it can be put into operation in  a very  short space oftime.     The  disadvantages are that      (a.) Men would be sent to their Regimental Dispersal  Stations, which in many cases would           be nowhere near their homes, and a good deal of unnecessary travelling would result.     (b.)  The  authorities, not having any returns to guide  them, would not know in what  units           the preponderance  of  the  trades  which are urgently required would be.   A  unit.           ordered to find a draft  might be able to supply only 40 or 50 per cent, of men of the           class required.  The remainder would have to be made up indiscriminately.  Another           unit might have men of the urgently  required classes far in excess of the draft ordered           to be supplied, and  many of these would remain inactive with their unit, while men           of the unit first mentioned whose  presence in civil life would  be,  for the  moment, of           little value to  the State, would  be demobilized.     Method B should be  adopted  if a period of at least 3 weeks&apos; preparation can be guaranteed.     The only disadvantage of  Method B is that  owing to the extra clerical labour involved andthe  organization  of the system  of drafting  numerous small detachments from each unit  to-
325A. R.  McBAIN (Secretary).              16th April, 1917.different Dispersal Stations, it  will take  3  weeks or a month  to put it into operation.   This-disadvantage disappears if there is an armistice during which preparation for demobilization canhe made.    Its advantages are :     (1.) Men would travel in conducted parties to a place within reasonable distance  of then-          homes. The danger of irresponsible individuals making long journeys all over the          country would be avoided.    (2.) It would enable the railway, officials to make more satisfactory provision for  the men&apos;s         journeys after they leave the Dispersal Station.    (3.) Owing to the  system of returns described, ii; can be ensured that the bulk of men          returning to civil life shall be of the class at the moment required by the nation.    (4.) Commanders would have more scope in controlling the drain from then subordinate          formations.    (5.) Under Method A, the D.A.GL, Base, would have a great deal of extra work thrown on          him by having to detail all parties from units.  This would not be  the case under          Method B,                                     K  H. BRADE (Chairman).       J.  B.  CROSLAND.           C.  E.

APPENDICES.APPENDIX A.RE POET ON DEMOBILIZATION AND THE LABOUR MARKET.  The urgent need of a comprehensive consideration inadvance of the serious problems that will arise when thelabour market is flooded after  demobilization has sug-gested to  us  that,  with the approval  of the  PrimeMinister, we should confer together with a view  to thepreparation of an  outline  scheme for minimising thedislocation of the labour market  on demobilization.  As a result,  we now submit the attached scheme, whichlays  down  the  principles which  we  think should  befollowed on demobilization, and  indicates the  machineryby  which effect can best be given to these principles.  Itdoes  not  attempt to  prejudge  the scale of  gratuitieswhich, folio wing the precedent of all previous wars, willbe granted by Parliament at the  termination of the war.The principles of the scheme, however, are  independentof the amount of the gratuities, and also of  the actualplan  and  order af  demobilization, which can  probablyonly be settled definitely at a later stage of the war.  The main features of  the scheme now  submitted are(a) the systematic  utilisation of the machinery  of theLabour Exchanges to facilitate the absorption of the dis-charged  men  into civil employment ;  (B) the proposedco-operation of the  Territorial Force Associations in thework of finding employment for  discharged  soldiers ;and (c) the proposal  to supplement any cash gratuity bya free policy  of  insurance against unemployment validfor one year, to be administered  through the machineryestablished for Unemployment Insurance.  These proposals are novel, inasmuch as neither LabourExchanges nor Territorial Force Associations, nor Un-employment Insurance machineiy were  in existence atany previous time of demobilisation.  In order to undertake these duties with success, it willbe necessary for the Board of Trade, in consultation withthe War Office, to make preliminary arrangements wellin advance, and these arrangements will in any case takeseveral  months.  We should therefore be  glad  if  thescheme could be approved in principle without prejudiceto any decision that  may be eventually arrived at  as tothe scale of gratuities to be granted.  We have not failed to note the fact that re-settlementin civil life of the men who  will  leave the colours  on theconclusion  of the present war is  a different problem notonly  in degree, but in kind from that  which the  dis-charged professional  soldier presents  in  normal times.The latter  class is, however, relatively so  small tha&apos;.. weconsider it  should be dealt with on the  lines of whateverplan  of demobilization is adopted for the  vastly greaternumber.  Separate  machinery for  different classes is ofcourse impracticable, but co-operation is essential betweenthe Departments concerned and the different societies andiissociations which now look after the welfare of the oldsoldier.  This memorandum does not profess to  deal with morethan  the  outlines of a  scheme for providing suitablemachinery  by means of  which to  carry out the processof demobilization with the best results from the point ofview of the labour market.   This, of course, is not theonly  problem  in this  connection which  demobilizationwill confront us with, and some adaptation  in  detail ofthe  practical working out of the scheme now proposedmay  be necessitated by  the solutions found  for  theseother problems.  No precise  forecast can as yet be madeof the Trade, Political, Military, or international situationat the close of  the war.  But upon these will depend  therate at which the troops can  be disbanded, and  the orderin which the various armies or their component parts canbe  returned to  civil  life.   Separate  consideration  willhave  to be  given to these factors  nearer the time when itmay be reasonably expected  that peace is in sight.  Butthis consideration will, in our opinion, be greatly facili-tatad by  the  acceptance in principle of  our presentproposals.  We have not lost sight of the fact that the terminationof the war  will gravely affect the  labour market in manyways not  dealt with  above, as, for  instance, by  thecessation of the production of war material.   We havethought it desirable, however, to  limit this Report to thes .ecial problem presented by the  return  of soldiers to-civil life, as in regard to this problem hi particular itappeared necessary to determine at the earliest possiblestage the general principles proposed to be followed.  We may add that we have only considered the questionof the demobilization of the Army.  The question of theNavy will no doubt be separately considered by the navalauthorities.

It is proposed that the  provision to be made for soldiers released from service with the colours at  the termination of the war should comprise the following :-   (a.)  A working furlough on the usual conditions  as to         full pay and  allowances for a  period of about         four weeks, during which  separation allowances         would continue to be paid.  (B.)  A travelling warrant for his railway fare from  the:         place of disbandment to his home district.  (e.)  Money gratuities for service and for Avar on scales         hereafter to be fixed.  (d.)  An  insurance policy against unemployment,  valid         for one year.  (e.)  Assistance  in finding employment as set out below.  2. Every soldier  to  be required, one  or two months before  the date  of disbandment (that  is  to say, two or three  months before  his formal discharge, allowing for a month&apos;s working furlough) to fill up a form (Form (A)) as to his occupation and  last employment before enlist- ment,  whether his employer made any  arrangement to keep a place open for him, and, if not, whether he would like his last emplo)er to be asked  to re-engage him if possible,  together with such  other  particulars  as are usually obtained  by Labour  Exchanges  from applicants desiring employment.  A draft of this form is attached, marked (A).   Copies of this form will be distributed by Commanding Officers, and it will be compulsory for every non-commissioned officer and private who is not remaining with the colours to  fill up one of them.  Men who are not employees will return their forms with a statement on them to that effect.  3. The registration forms thus filled up will  be  sent to the Labour Exchange  Department, which will communi- cate with  all employers stated by the soldiers to  be keeping places open, or whom  the Department has  been requested to approach. The employer will at the  same time be asked certain other questions with a view to ascertaining whether the employer is prepared to engage any other ex-soldiers, and also  whether  re-engaging the men whose places  have  been&apos; kept open  will involve discharging any  of his present workmen.  A draft of the  letter is  attached,  marked  (B).    The employers3 replies  will come to  the Local  Labour Exchange  (to which  also the soldier&apos;s registration forms  will be sent), and the Exchange will thus, before actual disbandment, prepare a  register  of  all the  soldiers  returning to  its locality, with information as to  employment available for them.  4. On disbandment, the soldier will receive :      (a.) Any arrears of pay due to him.     (B.) A travelling warrant to his home.     (c) A small sum in  cash (not more than 11.)  on           account of gratuities.     (d.) An identification certificate for  presentation at           Labour Exchange nearest bis  home.  5. On presentation of the identification certificate, theLabour Exchange will     (a.) Issue the insurance policy against unemployment          mentioned above.    (6.) Direct the soldier to any employment available          for him, by reference to the register previously          compiled.(4751)C

MINUTE   OF  APPOINTMENT.    The following are appointed to he a Committee to prepare a detailed scheme of procedurefor:-    (1)  Administering the special insurance against unemployment of demobilized soldiers andsailors (including its relation to the scheme of Unemployment Insurance under the Acts of 1911to 1916).    (2)  Registering demobilized soldiers and sailors  and placing them in employment eitherwith their former employer or with other employers&apos;:&apos;&apos; ,   .&apos;  i &apos;  &apos;       -    &apos; :                               Mr. Phillips (Chairman),                                Mr. Basham,      ;; ,     j    j  -            Major Wilson Pox,&apos;            &apos;;              ,-/ \                                Mr. Nicholson,                                Mr. Owen,                               Mr. Pas shore,                               Mr. Phice,                           with Mr. Colegate as Secretary.

EMPLOYMENT DEPARTMENT  COMMITTEE ON DEMOBILIZATION                                  PROCEDURE.REPORT.To THE DIRECTOR.Sir,    1.  We have the honour to submit the following report with regard to the matters referredto us in your minute of the 14th September, 1916.                             TERMS  OF REFERENCE.    2.  Our terms of reference were: -    To prepare a detailed scheme  of procedure for       (1)  Administering the special insurance  against unemrjloj^ment of  demobilized soldiers            and sailors (including its relation to the scheme  of  Unemployment  Insurance,            1911-1916).                                               .      (2)  Registering demobilized soldiers and sailors and placing them in employment  with            their former employers or with other employers.                                   PRELIMINARY.    3. At our  first  meeting we decided to. appoint two Sub-Committees, presided over byMr. Basham and Mr. Nicholson respectively, to prepare draft schemes of detailed procedure for       (1) administering the scheme of special insurance against unemployment, and      (2)  registering demobilized soldiers  and sailors and placing them in employment.The reports of these Sub-Committees are largely the basis of the present report.    4.  We have held six meetings and have also been in communication with the War OfficeDemobilization Committee in order to co-ordinate our proposals with the procedure to be adoptedby the Military Authorities in discharging men from the colours at the end of the War.  Wehave  not  had any  communication  with the  Admiralty,  as  it  was  understood  that  theReconstruction Committee had not yet considered the steps to be taken in  connection with thedemobilization of the Navy.  The detailed procedure set out below will, however, be applicablewith slight modifications to men discharged from the Navy at the end of the War.   The  pro-posals in the Report which relate more especially to the procedure to be adopted at EmploymentExchanges have been discussed with some Exchange Managers.    5. We have necessarily adopted, as the basis of  our proposals, the scheme outlined in theReport dated 23rd April, 1916, and signed by Sir  H.  Llewellyn  Smith aud Sir Reginald Bradeon &quot; Demobilization and the Labour Market.&quot;  Briefly, the scheme contained the following mainfeatures:       (a) The utilisation of the machinery  of  the Employment Exchanges to facilitate the            absorption of discharged  men into civil employment.      (6) The proposed co-operation of the Territorial Force Associations in the work of finding            employment for discharged soldiers.      (c) The proposal to supplement any cash  gratuity by a free  unemployment  insurance            policy valid for one year, to be administered through the machinery established for            unemployment insurance.    6. On the  1st December,  1916, the  Reconstruction  Committee definitely approved thefollowing proposals amongst others :        &quot; (a) That the State should grant to each soldier on demobilization a free unemployment            insurance policy for one year, the rate of benefit to be 10s. per week for a period not            exceeding twenty weeks during the year.      &quot; (b) That  the machinery  of  the Employment  Exchanges administration should be            strengthened for the purpose  of  discharging  the duties which  will fall upon it in            connection with demobilization.      &quot; (c) That a Central Demobilization Committee should be appointed, as soon as its exact            composition can be settled with the Departments concerned, to work in conjunction            with the Employment Department of the Ministry of Labour; that there  should be            a system of Local Demobilization Committees  covering the whole country to work in            conjunction with the Local Exchanges both the Central and Local Committees to            consist mainly of representatives  of employers and workmen in equal numbers; and            that the Central Committee should have an  opportunity of seeing and discussing            the scheme proposed, before it is finally adopted and put into operation.      &quot; (d) That there should be special provisions for considering on their merits applications            from men whose reasonable claims will not in  practice be met by the unemployment            insurance.scheme, and for granting State assistance in approved cases.&quot;(10935-14a.)  VVt. 2363-G. 69. 500. 5/17.  D &amp; S.  (J. 4.
    7.  With reference to the proposal in paragraph 6 (a) above, the detailed procedure pro-posed will be found in paras. 43 to 64 of this Report.    8.  We have not concerned ourselves with the proposal that the machinery of the Employ-ment Exchanges  administration should be strengthened and extended  as  mentioned in para-graph 6 (b) above.  This  matter was  dealt with in  the report of the Sub-Committee of theReconstruction Committee of which Sir Clarendon Hyde was Chairman, and proposals are alreadybeing prepared in the Department for carrying out the recommendations of that report.  We haveassumed for the purposes of this report that such additions to the local offices and staff as may benecessary for carrying out the work placed upon the Exchanges will be made.    9.  The constitution and functions of the Central Demobilization Committee and of the LocalCommittees (paragraph 6 (c) above) are obviously matters of the greatest importance in connectionwith the return of the discharged men to civil life.  We have not, however, made any recommenda-tions  with regard to them as we  were aware that they were to be otherwise dealt with,  and,moreover, they raised certain questions of policy which we did not regard as having been referredto us.  The procedure  which we recommend  has   been  framed  on the assumption that theseCommittees will be in  existence and actively co-operating with the Exchanges  in the work ofassisting discharged men to obtain suitable employment without delay.    10. The proposal  in paragraph 6 (d) of the Reconstruction Coinmittee&apos;s recommendationsis not one that directly concerns us, except in so far as  there may be a question  of  drawing aline between  ex-soldiers and ex-sailors who will receive free insurance policies and  those whowill be assisted by the Civil Liabilities  Committee or some similar body.   We feel that if theassistance proposed to be given is  to be similar to that given by  the Civil Liabilities Committeeat the present time, the best course would be  not  to  refuse  any ex-soldier or ex-sailor  auunemployment insurance policy,  but to allow any men who  wished to  do so to  apply  to theCivil  Liabilities Committee for special assistance. Such assistance should  not, however,  begiven in respect of unemployment as this would  mean,  in effect, that different rates of benefitunder different conditions would  be obtainable according to the status  of  the applicant.   Ar-rangements should, however, be  made  for  prompt interchange of information, centrally orlocally, wherever required,  between the Employment  Department and the Civil LiabilitiesCommittee (or any other body set up for the purpose) as to whether any particular man is oris not drawing Unemployment Benefit, or receiving assistance from the Committee.                             SCHEME OF PROCEDURE.    11.  The  Scheme  of Procedure which  we  recommend  falls  under  the following  mainheadings:                                I. PLACING IN EMPLOYMENT.      (1) Registration of men by army authorities.      (2) Distribution of  Forms of Registration to the  Exchanges  or   other Local Offices            nearest to the men&apos;s  homes.      (3) Negotiations with the  men&apos;s  previous  employers  or  with other  employers, so  that            work may be available  so far as possible for the men on discharge.      (4) Arrangements  with the Army Authorities with a view to the prior discharge of  men            for whom work is or may be expected to be immediately available.      (5) The placing  of men in employment after discharge.                   II. ADMINISTRATION OF UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE.      (1) Issue of Policies.      (2) Payment of Benefit.      (3) Claims to Benefit through Local Offices.      (4) Claims to Benefit through Trade Unions.                           I. PLACING IN EMPLOYMENT.-(1) REGISTRATION OF  MEN BY ARMY  AUTHORITIES AND RECEIPT OF  FORMS AT  EMPLOYMENT                                      DEPARTMENT.    12.  Every N.C.O. and private  who is not remaining with the colours will fill  up a form ofregistration, a copy of which is attached hereto  (Appendix A),  some two or three  months, ifpossible, before the probable date  of disbandment.    The registration forms, duly  completed by the men, should be examined by  a responsibleArmy  Officer  to  see that they have been properly filled up and should be stamped with anofficial stamp  showing the unit and its postal address, and then  collected and posted to  theEmployment Department of the  Ministry of Labour, at the  Claims and Record Office,  Kew.For this purpose  the War Office should  be asked to provide a special  envelope to enable  largequantities of  forms to  be sent together, and to  ensure  that they  shall all he  sent to  thecorrect address.  A note  showing the  unit concerned  and the number of  forms sent shouldaccompany all packets  of forms, and a  copy of this note should  be  posted under separate cover(Appendix B).                               (2) DISTRIBUTION OF FORMS.     13.  Immediately upon their receipt, the forms will,  for  the purpose of UnemploymentInsurance, be  classified in respect of  occupation, and, after  the  appropriate  classificationnumber has been  entered at the head of the form, search will be made in order to trace the man&apos;saccount with the Unemployment  Fund, if his statement on the form, or his previous employ-xnent, shows that he has or should have had such an account.  After the numbers  of the  men&apos;s
3unemployment books (if any) have been noted on the forms, the latter should be sorted according-to the Employment  Exchanges within the areas of which the men s, home addresses  lie, anddespatched to these  Exchanges, which will forward them to Local  Agents  when necessary.Statistical records should be kept of. the number of forms despatched from Kew to each Exchange,and transmitted by an Exchange to a Local Agent.           ,     ,    -        .   f.,  .     . ^    14   It is not proposed to keep  a duplicate copy  of the man s form at  the  Uaiins andRecord  Office at Kew, as  it is not considered that  any useful purpose would  be served  by sodoing.  The man can always be traced through his &quot; home &quot;  Exchange (i.e., that winch coversthe home address that he originally gave).                           (3)  ISTEGOTIATIONS  WITH EMPLOYERS.    15.   Upon the receipt of the forms at the Local Office, i.e., the Employment Exchange orLocal Agency as the case may be, two cards will be made out in respect of each form :-      (a)  A Reference Card (Appendix C) giving the information on the form and containing            spaces for recording the result of the steps taken  to place the man in employment,            &amp;c,and      (6)  An Index Card (Appendix D)  giving the man&apos;s name  and address,  his occupation            and classification number,  and containing  spaces for  indicating  in  what part            of the Register by Occupations the Reference Card is to be found.    16.   The Reference Cards will be arranged in  a Register according to the occupations ofthe men.  Under each trade  the cards will be sub-divided under  the following  heads:        (a)  Cases  where the man  states that he requires assistance in finding  employment and            work has not yet been found.      (6)  Cases  where assistance is required and work has been found.      (c)  Cases where the man states that he requires no assistance.    When  the Register is  commenced there will, of course,  be no cards  filed  under  the sub-classification (&amp;).    IT.   The Index  Cards will be filed in alphabetical order of the men&apos;s names. This willenable a man&apos;s Reference Card to be found in the Register  by Occupations under the appropriateoccupation group.    .18.   As the Reference and Index Cards are being made  out  from the forms, care  mustbe taken to note all  forms of men belonging to Trade Unions.  In each  such- case, a  form ofnotification (Appendix E) must be completed and despatched to the Union, or branch of theUnion,  concerned.  This notification  will  contain an invitation to co-operate  with the LocalOffice in endeavouring to place the man in suitable employment.    19.   The Registration Forms relating to men who wish a  communication to be sent to theirprevious employers should be  sorted in bundles in  alphabetical order under the names of theemployers mentioned in the replies to question 5 on the  Registration Form, separate  bundlesfor different departments being made where necessary in  the  case  of large establishments.  Itis important that communications to an employer should be sent only by the Local Office in thearea of  which the employees  establishment is situated, exceptions  to this rule being allowed.at the direction  of the Divisional Officer, in large towns  where there is more  than one LocalOffice.  Accordingly, any forms on which action has to be taken with an employer in the area ofanother Local Office  should be sent to that Office for such action; the  first Office should retainthe Reference and Index Cards originally made out. noting on the Reference Card the despatchof the Registration form.    20.   The forms  of men  who do  not wish communication to be  made to  their previousemployers will be filed, in alphabetical order of the men&apos;s names,  with the forms  of the menwho wish no action to be taken on their behalf.    2.1.   With  regard to the  men in respect of whom  communication is to be made to theirprevious employers, it will be necessary to make out&quot; schedules containing particulars of themen and to send these schedules to the employers with an  appropriate covering letter enquiringwhether each man can be,re-engaged.    22.   There  are three general  classes  of cases for which provision must be  made:        (1) Men  who  state  that their  employers have  promised to re-engage  them after the            war.      (2)  Men who, without alleging a promise of re-instatement, state that they wish their case            brought to the notice of their pre-war employer and for whom there is a reasonable            prospect of re-instatement in their old work.      (3)  Men who,  without  alleging  a promise of re-instatement, state that they wish their            case brought  to the notice of their pre-war employer,  but for whom there is not            a reasonable  prospect  of  re-instatement  in their  old work.   Such  cases  will  be            e.g., those of men employed prior to  enlistment upon public works&apos; contracts            known to have now terminated.    23.   The particulars from the forms  in the employer&apos;s  bundle will  be transcribed uponseparate schedule forms (Appendices F and G), according to  the class in which they fall (seeprevious paragraph).   The schedules proposed for the three  classes are precisely similar, save thatthe one.to be used for the first class,  i.e., for the  men who  state  that their  employers havepromised to re-engage them after the war, has a. statement to that effect on it.    24.   Four forms of the covering letter to employers  are proposed (Appendices H, J,  EZ andL), and it is suggested that these letters should go out as  from the Local Demobilization Com-mittee.  Letter H  will  cover schedules relating to  men,  some of  whom are in  class (1) andothers in class (2).   Letter J  will cover schedules relating to men in class (1)  only.   LetterK will cover schedules relating, to men in class (2) only.  Letter L will cover schedules relatingto men  m  class  (3) only.   The employer will  be asked to return the schedules to the office   10935                                                                             A 3
sending them out,  i.e., his Local Office.  The despatch of the letter and  relevant scheduleswill be noted on the relevant Reference Cards.    25.  As stated above, communications to employers will normally be  sent by  the  LocalOffice in the area of which the employees establishment is  situated,  and, consequently,  mpreparing schedules for employers,  care must be taken  to include  particulars of  any menresiding in the areas of other Local Offices whose names  have been sent to the  Local  Officein question because the men&apos;s pre-war employers come within the area of that Local Office.    26.  As soon as schedules have  been  despatched,  the  bundles of  forms will be filed-alphabeticallv under employers.  Any further batch of forms received in respect  of the sameemployer will he sorted into his file after  despatch  of  schedules in respect of  the  additionalmen.    27.  An employees  reply, when  received, will  immediately be  acknowledged  by  theManager or Local Agent in a&apos;note which will  promise a further communication as  soon asfurther information is available.  The  information given in  the reply will be entered  on therelevant Reference Cards in the Register by  Occupations.. When the  man&apos;s Reference Cardis being kept at another office, the information should be transmitted to that office for thispurpose.    28.  In all cases  where an employer  gives a promise of immediate re-engagement,  thetear-off slip which is at  the foot of the Registration form will be stamped with the  name  of, theLocal Office and with the letter A (signifying that the man is to be released as soon  as possible),detached,  and forwarded  to the officer  commanding  the unit with  which the  man is serving.The fact that a man&apos;s  case has been noted for early release will at  the same  time be  notedon his Reference Card.    The Registration forms, affer the  employees  reply  has  been received  and any necessary-action  taken, will be filed away in alphabetical order in the  general  file of such forms.   (SeeParagraph 19.)    29.  On receipt of the schedules  from the employers, order cards will be made  out forthose employers who are prepared to re-engage men.   When schedules are received from otherdistricts, an order card  in red ink will  be made out and the names of the accepted  men enteredthereon.   If the employer is also willing to take other men,  ex-soldiers or not,  this  should benoted on the card.    30.  In those cases where  the employer is not prepared to  re-engage the men or some ofthem,  it will be necessary  to  take  steps to  find them other employment.  Probably in  themajority of cases it will  not be possible to do much in this  direction until the  men arrive,but any arrangements that may be practicable should be made with the assistance  of the LocalDemobilization  Committee.   If the number of such cases appears to be exceptional^ large inany area, the fact should be brought specially to the notice of the  Local Demobilization Com-mittee and  reported to headquarters in order that appropriate steps  may he taken  to relieveany exceptional unemployment that appears likely  to arise.   In this connection, it may  benecessary  to establish  procedure for circulating  particulars of surplus labour as  well as par-ticulars of vacancies.   Any cases  in which the employer appears to  be  breaking  a  pledge tore-instate  men  will,  of  course,  be specially considered by the Committee and reported  to  theproper authority.   31.  There remains to be considered the action to be taken  in the cases of men in  respect ofwhom  communication is not to be made to previous employers.  These will include all the menwho expressed no wish for such communication to be made (save in special cases where the LocalOffice nevertheless thinks it desirable to make such a  communication) and certain other men inwhose  case it is known(that re-instatement is impracticable owing to the death of the  employer,termination of contracts,  &amp;c   The action to be taken will  be  similar to  that described  in  thepreceding paragraph.(4) arrangements  with the altmy authorities  for prior  discharge of certain classes &apos;                                         of Men.     32.  It is believed that it will he possible for this Department to indicate a limited numberof trades in which  the  demand  for labour is  such  that men belonging to those  trades may hedemobilized in advance of others and, conversely, there may be trades, men belonging to  whichought  to be demobilized last of all.  In order that arrangements of this kind may be possible,the military authorities are classifying  all the men at present serving with the  Colours accord-ing to  a list of occupations provided by the Employment Department and  set out in Appendix 0.It  must,  of course,  be understood  that it is not expected that more than a  limited numberof trades  can be indicated,  and it must also be understood that it  is  proposed  merely to o-fvea preference,  the effectiveness of which will  depend  upon  the  circumstances obtaining  at^heend of the war.     33.   There will be a second class of cases in which arrangements for early  discharge may he possible, that is to say,  cases where  either the  employer gives a promise of  immediate re- engagement (see paragraph 28 above) or where a definite assurance of immediate  employment is otherwise obtained.   The procedure in this latter  case  will be the same  as that  indicated in paragraph 28 above, that is to say, the tear-off slip at the foot of the man&apos;s form will be stamped with the letter A and the name of the Local Office, and despatched to the Commanding  Officer of the-unit with which the man is serving.                   (5)  Placing of Men ix  Employment after  Discharge.     34.   When the man calls at the Local Office, he must  first produce the identification slip, which will have been given to each man by the Military Authorities when he is disbanded.&apos;
 Search will then be made for his card in the Index Card Register which will give information as to where his Reference Card may be found in the Register by Occupations.   The card when found must be removed from this Register and placed in the ordinary Register  of the Exchange (in the Live, Suspense or Dead Register as the case may be) but all cards relating to discharged soldiers will&apos; be  kept  separately within each trade group of the ordinary Register.  After his Unemployment Insurance Policy has been issued to him (see paragraph 4-3 below)  the question of employment must be dealt with.   The procedure will vary according to the particular case in question.                                                      f     35.  If the Reference Card indicates that  the man&apos;s pre-war employer is prepared to re- engage him, the course of action will depend upon whether the employer&apos;s address is or is not in the area of the Local  Office.     If the employer&apos;s address is in the area of the Local Office,  the man will be given an intro- duction card (Appendix M) and sent to the  employer.     If the employer&apos;s address is in the area of another Local Office, that Office will, as a  rule, be communicated with in order to find out from the employer the date  on which the man should proceed to work.  Upon receipt of  a satisfactory reply, the man will be sent to the employees &quot;Local Office, which will put him into touch  with the employer.   It may be desirable to provide free railway warrants for such cases.     Prior communication  with the employer and the passing of the man through the employer&apos;e Local Office, though usually  desirable, should not be invariably  insisted upon.   They should be dispensed with where the man can be more conveniently sent direct to the employer.     In all cases  sufficient information  should be obtained and entered  on the Reference Card at the time of the man&apos;s call to enable the Local Office to place him in other employment if his previous employer fails to re-engage him.   At the expiration of one  week, if  the  introduction card has not been returned by the employer, a reminder should be sent enquiring whether the workman  is being re-engaged.   In the event of re-engagement the man&apos;s card will be removed from the Register and filed with the Reference Cards of men placed during the current month.     During the interval (if any) between the date when the workman attends at the Local Office and that at which he is placed at work, he should, of course, be allowed to claim unemployment benefit under the usual conditions.    36.  If the  workman decides for  any reason not to go to an employer who has agreed to engage him, a communication should be addressed to the employer informing him that the man is not available and offering to submit  another ex-service man for the vacancy in question.    37.  If the  card  indicates  that a  communication has been  addressed to an  employer, but that no reply has been received, he will immediately be informed through his Local Office that the man is now available for employment and he should be pressed for a reply to the previous comm unication.    38.  If the  card  indicates that the pre-war  employer will not  re-engage the workman, special steps will be  taken to  place him. elsewhere and, where necessary,  the case should be brought before the  Local  Committee as  one of failure to redeem a promise of re-engagement. (See paragraphs 30 and 41.)    39.  If the man&apos;s address on his identification slip is not in  the area of the Local Office, an effort should be made to obtain,  from the appropriate Local Office, particulars of the  action taken in his case, including information as to whether employment has been found for him.  If,  how- ever,  the man so  wishes, he should be registered  at once and treated as an  ordinary applicant. If his own Local Office has no trace of the Registration Form he will be registered on the special Reference Card and efforts will be made to find him suitable employment.  His pre-war employer will be approached with regard to re-engagement if the man so desires.    40.  If the man&apos;s address on his identification slip is in the area of the Local Office, but no card for him can be found in  the Index, he will be registered on the special Reference Card and efforts will be made  to find him suitable employment.  His pre-war employer will be approached with regard to re-engagement  if the man so desires.    41.  If any  workman complains that his pre-war  employer refuses to re-engage  him  in spite  of an alleged  promise to do so, or  if he wishes to complain or to have his  case specially treated, his attention should be drawn to the existence of the Local Demobilization  Committee, to which also any other case of difficulty should be referred by Managers.  We suggest  that a notice should be displayed  in  each Local  Office  describing the constitution, and in general terms -the functions, of the  Demobilization Committee,  and stating  that  men, who wish to consult it, should indicate their wish to the Secretary of the Committee who will  arrange for them to be seen, in the first instance, by a rota committee of the Demobilization Committee.    42. Paragraphs 11 to 41 set out no more than the bare skeleton of the procedure that shouldbe followed.  If it  is  to achieve any measure of  success it must be vitalised and clothed with flesh and blood by the personal efforts and enthusiasm of the Exchange Officers, the Local Agents, and the Local Committees.  By means of the Local Committee the cordial support of employers and trade  unionists  should be enlisted on the side of the  Exchange and  the constant aim shouldbe to secure the greatest measure of co-operation among all parties concerned.  It is not necessary that  a stereotyped pattern of  procedure should be  adopted everywhere; full allowance must be made for local circumstances  and local  preferences,  and, within very wide limits, any variation. from  the standard methods should be admitted when it  seems likely to forward, in the special case, the one object  of facilitating the return of discharged soldiers and sailors to civil  employ- meat.10935
            II.-ADMINISTRATION OF UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE.                                  (1) ISSUE OF POLICIES.     43.  On arrival of the discharged soldier at the Local Office, he must, as explained in para-graph 34 above,  produce his identification slip.  This slip is to be taken  from  the  man  andAssociated with the Reference Card which should have been made out for him.  Upon this cardJwill be found the classification number of the man&apos;s occupation.  This number will be writtenon his Employment Policy. &apos; He should then be asked to sign the policy in the space providedfor the purpose.  This signature should be compared with that on the discharge certificate which,must be produced.   If satisfactory, the discharge certificate should be stamped &quot;Policy issuedNo..........&quot; with a rubber stamp provided for the purpose, and handed back to the man with hisEmployment Policy.     44.  The identification slip should be endorsed by the Local Officer with the number of thepolicy issued to the workman,  the classification number of  his  occupation together  with  thenumber of his ordinary unemployment book, if any, and should be forwarded to the Claims  andRecord Office, Eew.     45.  A draft of the proposed  Employment Policy, which should bear a serial number  andshould contain 24 pages and counterfoils, each page to bear the same serial number, is shown inAppendix N.   The policy should he retained by the holder except during the currency of a claimto benefit.     The first available page is to be used on  each occasion of  a fresh  claim and a new pageshould be put into use on every Monday if the workman continues to sign.     46.  The  suggested form of  Employment  Policy and the proposed method  of  using itconstitute a  radical departure  from the existing  system relating to claims to unemploymentbenefit under the National Insurance  (Unemployment)  Acts, 1911-16.   The change is possiblebecause the amount of benefit payable  to discharged soldiers and sailors is in no way dependenton any particulars which are not in possession of the Local Officer who  holds the EmploymentPolicy, e.g., the amount of benefit is not limited by any payment of contributions which is knownonly to the  Claims and Record Office.  We have carefully considered the  advantages  and  dis-advantages involved in this change and have decided that it is one which  should be adopted.   InAppendix P is set out a note on the saving of work which it is anticipated will he  effected by itsadoption.                                 (2)  PAYMENT OF BENEFIT.     47.  The conditions upon which  benefit may  be  obtained will  depend upon  the provisionsof the Act Avhich must presumably be  passed for authorising the scheme.  It has been assumedfor the purposes of  this report that unemployment benefit under the National Insurance (Unem-ployment) Acts, 1911-1916, cannot be drawn at the same time as the special unemployment benefitfor ex-soldiers.   It has further been assumed  that, in other respects, benefit will be obtainableupon similar conditions to  those at present applying under the National Insurance (Unemploy-ment) Acts, 1911-1916, save for the conditions relating to the number of contributions, &amp;c.  Itwill thus be necessary for  a  policy holder desiring to obtain benefit to make application at anEmployment Exchange or other Local Office.  Applications should as a  rule be made.in personbut the exceptions now  allowed  in   the  ordinary unemployment insurance procedure shouldcontinued to be allowed.  It is understood that it is proposed that each soldier should be granted,on demobilization, working furlough with full pay and allowances for four weeks (during whichperiod separation allowances would continue to be paid) Avhether or not  the recipient is indus-trially employed.  Application for unemployment benefit should be allowed at any Local Office atany time after the commencement of the last week of furlough.     48.  The Employment Policy, and the unemployment book, if any, must  be lodged  andstamped at the Local Office at the time of claiming and should remain lodged during the currency of a claim.   A receipt (U.I.  40 suitably adapted) should be issued in exchange for the Eniploy-nient Policy when lodged and the  man&apos;s ordinary unemployment book (if any).   Any applicant insured under Part I. of the National Insurance Act, 1911,  must produce a Health Book ifrequired.     49.  The proposed Employment  Policy will permit of the abolition of the present formof claim (U.T. 80, &amp;c), Vacant Ticket (U.I. 90)  and the Unemployment Register (U.I. 91). Each signature is in itself a claim to benefit and a declaration of unemployment.     50.  We are not certain  whether workmen will be permitted to draw their benefit through a Trade Union under arrangements similar to those in force  under Section 105 of the NationalInsurance Act, 1911 (as amended).   If such  arrangements are permitted the scheme detailed in paragraphs 59 to 64 below will apply.  Whilst the  question of permitting such arrangementsis one of general  policy, if should be recognised that they will involve considerable complicationsand much additional administrative expense.                      (3) CLAIMS  FOE. BENEFIT THROUGH LOCAL OFFICE.     51.  The applicant for benefit will be registered at the Local Office on the Index Card  (see paragraphs 15 and  34 above), which will contain (on the back) the spaces  required in connection with claims to unemployment benefit (Appendix C.).     52.  The present register of claims to benefit that  have been authorised bv the Insurance Officer (i.e.,  authorities to pay) and notification of claims  to benefit that have&quot; been lodged at a Local Agency will not be necessary.   All necessary  information on these points  will be found m the workman&apos;s personal account, which will be kept at Kew  and entered weekly from  the schedules from Local Offices, showing the amounts paid to workmen on the claims current at the
39Local Office (i.e., Schedule I.)... The amount of money asked for each week by the Local Office    be checked against the Schedule of Payments made in the previous week to see whether, it.can, appears reasonable.  With;the workman&apos;s personal account will be associated the pages removed from the workman&apos;s policy, duly signed and receipted by him in respect of benefit paid.     53.  The Local Officer will scrutinise each claim to benefit lodged at his office to see whether benefit should be paid, and,  if it be found that the claim is in order, will authorise payment thereon.                                                                .  &apos;     54.  Where the claimant has been employed since  discharge from His Majesty s horees, his last employer will be referred to and asked if he  has any observations  to offer which affect the question  of the disqualification  of the claimant from the receipt of such benefit (P.I. 85). The form of  enquiry to the employer will be sent out by&apos; the Local Office at which  the claim to benefit was lodged, but, in all cases, the reply will be returnable to the Claims and Record Office.  The  form  will be dealt with, in the manner  at  present in operation, by an  Insurance Officer, and, if the reply warrants such action, a notice that no further benefit should be paid on the claim in question will be issued to the Local Office direct from the Claims and Record Office.   :  55.  All claims to benefit which are  not admitted by the Local  Office will be referred  to the  Claims  and  Record  Office,  where  they will  be  dealt  with by the Insurance Officer. If benefit is  disallowed by the Insurance Officer, the procedure with  regard to appeals to the Courts of Referees and the Umpire will apply as under the National Insurance (Unemployment) Acts, 1911-1916.     56.   The week for calculation  of benefit should be  the calendar  week, ?;.e.,-from Monday to Saturday,  and benefit should  be paid on Wednesday Tip to the previous Saturday, as it is thought that it would not be possible, in a time of great pressure,  to allow  for payment of demobilization benefit and also  of ordinary unemployment benefit on the same  day.   This. however, will not apply &quot;to benefit paid through a Trade Union (see below) which may fix its own Aveekly period.  The  concession allowed by the existing scheme  of. Unemployment Insur- ance as to  payment on.other days  should  be allowed under similar conditions.   At the time of payment, the  receipted  page or pages of the Employment Policy should be  torn out  by the Local Officer so  as to  be  forwarded in due  course (as a voucher) to  the  Claims and Record Office with the Schedule of Payments  made.  In addition to the receipted page or pages,  all other pages containing any signature prior to the payment of benefit should  also be  torn out and similarly forwarded with the Schedule at the first payment during the currency of a claim.    57.   The weekly schedule of the amounts of payments made  will contain  entries showing the numbers of the policies on which  benefit has been  paid, and  the amounts thereon. The receipted page or pages, in respect of which benefit has been paid, will be forwarded weekly with this  schedule to  the Claims and Record Office.  The  Claims and Record Office will check the schedule  from the  pages, which  will then be detached, in order that&apos;they may be sorted into policy order  for  posting in the personal accounts  and for subsequent filing in that  order for ready reference.   The record of unemployment in the case of each person to whom benefit has been paid will thus be automatically built up.    58.   When a  claimant desires  to transfer his claim to  another Local  Office, he should he allowed to lift his Employment Policy during office hours at the Local Office.  Before the policy is handed over, it should, of course, he  made up to date as regards the  record of unemployment and  as regards the counterfoil entries.   The  position will, therefore, be obvious to the next Local Office at which it is presented. The Local Office to which the claim is transferred  should notify the Claims and Record Office of  the fact of transfer.  There will, no doubt, be some few cases in which a man will, during the currency of a claim, present himself at another Local Office without his Employment Policy, but these can be met by the signature of a special  loose-leaf page to be attached, subsequently, to the Employment Policy.  Payment, however, can only be made provided that the Employment Policy is subsequently associated with any such loose pages. Por  the  purpose of association,  the second  Local  Office should  requisition. the Employment Policy from the Office at which it is lodged.                      (4)  CLAIMS TO BENEFIT THROUGH  TRADE UNIONS.    59.   A workman  who desires to draw benefit through  his Trade Union  will attend at a Local Office and  make a claim for benefit  on a special form.   If the Local Office at which the claim is made is the office with which the workman\s Branch is connected, and if his claim is in order, the  Local Office  will authorise  the  claim, subject to the  conditions for the  receipt  of unemployment benefit being satisfied, and will notify  the fact to the Branch Secretary  of the Association by means  of an adapted Form U.I. 76.   Thereafter the workman will either sign his Union&apos;s Vacant Book or give proof  of his unemployment by means of Vacant Tickets.     60.  If the Vacant Book is kept at the Local Office, the Local Officer  will forward to the Branch  Secretary of the Association to  which the workman belongs, a  form U.I.  75,  showing- the signatures made by the workman in the Vacant Book.  The  form will  be  forwarded each week to.the Branch Secretary on a day to be arranged  locally, having regard to the pay-week of the Association.  The Branch Secretary will complete the form in  the usual way and  return it to the Local Office  on the Monday following the day on which benefit is paid.  It is desirable in the case of Trade Unions, who already have arrangements with the Ministry of Labour  under Section 105 of the National Insurance Act, 1911 (as amended), that as far as possible there shouldbe separate pages in the Vacant Books for the use of discharged soldiers and sailors, and of other members of the Unions.    61.   The Local Officer will also stamp the page, in the space provided for the Policy Holder&apos;s daily signature, with the word &quot; signed &quot; in respect  of the days signed in the Vacant&quot;Book, the clays for which a  duly endorsed Vacant Ticket has been produced or the days  for which signature   10935                                                                            A 6/
has been excused, and lie will rule out clays not so signed, and will otherwise complete the pageas far as possible.   The counterfoil of the policy will then be completed and the page torn outand forwarded to the Claims and Record Office, attached to the Form U.I. 75.    62.  If the Vacant Book is not kept at the Local Office, then the Secretary of the Associationwill supply to the Exchange with which his Branch is connected, the  Form U.I. 75 showing thedays signed by the workman.  The Local Officer will then deal with the page of the EmploymentPolicy as indicated in the previous paragraph, and will  forward the page together with the17.1. 75 to the Claims and Record Office.    63.  When the workman is unable to sign the  Vacant Book, and has obtained a  VacantTicket,  the  latter,  after  having been  used  by the workman,  will be returned  by  him  tohis Branch Secretary  who will retain it with the Vacant Book for future reference on  audit ifrequired.    64.  If  the Local Office taking the claim is not the Local Office  with which the branch ofthe workmen&apos;s association  is connected,  the procedure for dealing with the claim will be similarto that at present  in use  for ordinary  Unemployment  Insurance  benefit  claimed  in suchcircumstances.                                      SUMMARY.    65.  The scheme of procedure recommended in this Report may be summarised as follows :        (1) Every non-commissioned officer and  man, two or three months before the probable            date of disbandment, will  fill up a registration form giving particulars  of his home            address,  his  previous employers, and his  industrial experience.      (2) The forms  will be sent to the  Claims and Record Office,  Kew,  where they will be            classified by  occupations and be marked with the reference number of the man&quot;s            unemployment hook (if any).  The forms  will  then be distributed to the Local            Offices (Exchanges or Local  Agencies) for  the  areas in which the soldiers intend            to reside on demobilization.      (3) At the Local Office two cards  will be made  out for  each man, to be  filed  one in            occupation order, the  other  in  alphabetical  order.   The cards  filed  in  occupa-            tion order will contain the full particulars with regard to the man,  and will be            subdivided according to whether work has  been found or not, and whether assist-            ance is or is  not required.  The cards filed in alphabetical order will  be used for            the purpose of finding the  man&apos;s card in the Register by  Occupations.      (4) When the man  alleges  a promise of re-instatement by his  previous employer or asks            that this  employer may be  invited to  re-engage him,  a communication  will  be            sent to the employer,  enquiring whether he is  willing  to re-engage the man and            asking whether this  re-engagement will entail the dismissal of any other man or            woman.      (5) Where a  man states that he  is a member of a Trade Union, notice of his impending            return will  be sent  to his  Branch  Secretary together with .an  invitation  to            co-operate in  finding him  employment.      (6) In all  cases, except those of men who state that they do not desire assistance,  efforts            will be made, in conjunction with the  Local Demobilization Committee, to secure a            promise of employment for the man as soon as  he returns, care being taken that            a proper rate of wages is offered.      (7) In each  case where  a  guarantee  of re-engagement or immediate employment is            obtained, the man&apos;s name will  be reported to his  Commanding  Officer with a            request for early release.      (8) Early  release will also  be arranged in  the  case  of men  engaged  in  trades  to be            specified from  time  to time  by  the Ministry as trades  in which  the demand for            labour is, or will be, such  as to ensure the men&apos;s immediate employment.      (9). Where a  man alleges breach  by a  pre-war employer of a  promise of re-engagement            or for any other reason considers that his case requires special treatment, the matter            will be dealt  with by the Local Demobilization Committee.     (10) In the case of any district where a  considerable amount  of unemployment  may be            expected to occur, the matter  should be taken into consideration  by the  Local            Demobilization Committee at an early date.      (11) The soldier,  on returning, will obtain from the Exchange or  Local Agency a *ard            of introduction to the  employer  with whom employment has been found fov him,            or, if such employment has not yet been found, fuller particulars  will be taken of            his qualifications, and special steps will be taken to find  employment for him.     (12) At the time of the man&apos;s first call, whether employment has been found  for him or            not, he will be handed an Unemployment Insurance Policy, valid for one year from            the  date of his discharge.   This Policy will be in the form of a book with counter-            foils and will be retained by him except during the currency of a claim.      &apos;     (13) Applications for benefit will  be  entertained at any Local Office at any time after the            commencement of the last week  of furlough and must be made in person,  subject            to the exceptions now allowed under the existing schemes  of State&apos;Insurance against             Unemployment.
338n     (14) Doubtful or. disputed cases ana all appeals will be dealt with in the ordinary way by            the Insurance Officer, the Court of Referees, and the Umpire.   In all other cases            payment of benefit will be authorised by the Local Officer without reference to the            Claims and Record Office.     (15) The procedure to be followed can, if necessary,  be adapted, on the lines indicated            in the Report, to cases where the policy-holder desires to receive payment through            his Union.    66.  In conclusion, we desire to express our obligations to our Secretary, Mr. W. A. Colegate,for the zeal and ability which he has displayed in carrying out his duties.                            We have the honour to be, Sir,                                            Tour obedient Servants,                                                    T.   W.

In case of uncertainty       as to the address to which you will return, an address should be given to which letters may be sent.(5)  The name of the employer required is that  of  the employer by whom you were employed immediately       before enlistment.   As full details as possible of the employment should  be given in order that the       firm may easily be able to identify you.  If you had no employer because you were unemployed at       the time of enlistment, you should  state here the name of  the employer for whom you worked before       you became unemployed.  If you have never worked for an employer at all and do not intend to work       for an employer, you should state in (13) that  you wish no action  taken  on your behalf  and fill in       nothing  after (4).   If  you wish  to be employed, although you have never previously worked for an       employer, say so in (13) and complete (8) and (10).(6)  This question must only be answered in the affirmative in cases where the employer gave a j)erfectly       definite promise to keep your place open for you.(8)  The answer to (8) should be as  precise as possible.  It will be of  little use giving such replies as &quot; work       in  the  country,&quot; engineering, labouring work, etc.  The  actual occupation desired must, as far as       possible, be given as for example, &quot; cowman, turner, dock  labourer, slate quarryman, etc.&quot;(9)  The reply to question (9) should  give the names of the previous employers, if any, by whom you were       employed before the employer for whom you were working at the time of your enlistment.(11)  The information asked for in question (11) is required in order that the Trade Dnions concerned may be        given an opportunity to assist in  finding  suitable employment for their members in their own trade        and should be given in all cases where possible.N.B.

  NOTE ON  SAYING  UNDER  PROPOSED SCHEME-FOR  PAYMENT  OF  BENEFIT (See para 46)    The present Unemployment Insurance procedure involves a considerable number of clerical, entries both by theapplicant and by Local Offices.  It also involves reference of each claim to the Claims and Record Office at Kew.    The use of the proposed Employment Policy  will reduce considerably the number of clerical entries ; it will enablethe use of certain forms to be dispensed with and  it will abolish, in the straightforward cases, the necessity of referringthe claim to the Head Office.  It will be understood that the expected pressure of work after demobilization makesthese reductions in work an important matter.  In the case of direct claims the forms abolished are (1) the&apos; Claim toBenefit (a document of two foolscap sheets), (2) the Vacant Ticket, (3) the form upon which  the unemployed work-man signs daily, i.e., an equivalent of a Vacant Book, and  (4), at the Head  Office, the  equivalent of the Register ofAuthorities to pay.                                                                      &apos;-&apos;   -    An estimate has been made of the time taken in dealing with claims under the present procedure and under theproposed procedure.  From this it appears that, in the case of direct claims, a  saving of time spent  in clerical work tothe extent of about 30% may be expected.  With regard to claims through trade&apos; unions the saving is; of course, not sogreat, since, whilst there is some reduction in the number of forms to be used, it is not possible to reduce the items ofwork arising from the communications which are necessary between the Local Offices of the Department and the localbranches of the different Associations.  It is, however, estimated that, even  in these cases, the  saving in clerical workwill amount  to about 20%.                                                 -                 -    (-    Below is a statement giving the calculations upon which this figure is based.

                   ESTIMATE OF TIME TAKEN IN DEALING WITH  20  CLAIMS.                                                Summary.    Estimated time taken under proposed procedure for 20 claims......   Direct = 16 hours (Statement A).    Estimated time taken under proposed procedure for 20 claims......   Through Trade  Union = 20 Jiours                                                                       (Statement B).    Therefore 20 claims through Trade Unions cost 25 per cent, more than 20 Direct claims.    Additional time taken in dealing with 10,000 claims through  Trade Dnions instead of Directs 2,000 hours = 61clerks for one week.    Additional work in Trade Union cases not included in estimate :         (1.)  All correspondence, distribution of forms, etc., incidental to fresh  arrangements  under Section 105 being              made by Associations not hitherto having arrangements.        (2.)  Inexperienced Branch  Secretaries fill up forms and render correct weekly statements (U.I. 75) with              difficulty.   This throws considerable additional work on the Department.        (3.)  Work in  connection with Vacant Tickets.        (4.)  Possibility of transfer of claim from &quot; Trade Union &quot; to &quot; Direct &quot; and vice versa.        (5.)  The greater  the number of Branches connected with an Exchange,  the greater the discrepancy in time              taken at that Exchange between &quot; Trade Union &quot; and &quot; Direct.&quot;        (6.)  The greater  the  number of Associations having arrangements,  the greater the number of separate              accounts which the Department has to keep, and consequently the greater the  expenditure of time  on              any given number of claims.    The estimate excludes any additional  work which may be caused through the procedure not being carried out withaccuracy from the start.
