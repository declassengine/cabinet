(7/ar- Cabinet 246,  Minute 20).            The  -7ar  Priorities Committee held their Second Meeting         on  September 20th,  1917,  at 2 Whitehall Gardens, S,^..         at  4.15 p.m.,  and  I append  for the information of my         Colleagu.es  and for  the  approval of the war Cabinet, a         copy  of the  Minutes of the Meeting.          The Minister of  Munitions desires that the attention         of  the  War  Cabinet  may be drawn to his dissent from         the first conclusion of the Committee.                                        (Intld). J.C.S. 2 Whitehall Gardens,  S.77.         2nd November,  1917,TEE MINISTER OP MIDITIOHS handed to     members of  the     Committee a Memorandum by Sir Arthur Duokham on the     Aeronautical programme dated September 20, 1917,     with a covering Note by himseif, in which he r$-     iteratod his view that there was no reason to suppose     that the immense programme of aeroplane construction     which haa been sanctioned could not be achieved     provided that the requirements of his Department in     skilled labour and materials 7/ere met and that     Admiralty requirements were not accorded unconditional     super priority.   Mr.  Churchill referred to the     cooplioated nature of  the whole priority question     and  of the intricate work of co-ordinating the     different priorities.    In his opinion the difficulty     woulc only be satisfactorily met if the war Cabinet     were able to decide upon and coiimunicate to the     principal 7/ar Departments the  general character of     their 7&apos;ar plan for 1918.
SIR ERIC Gl^DDES agreed with Ur. Churohill that It was.     highly desirable for the Committee to be informed     of the main features of tho Cabinets war plan for     tho following year.THE CHAIRiiAJJ said thet it was not possible or-desirable     for the War Cabinet to draw up now a rigid plan for     the coming year which would admit of no flexibility     to meet changing situations *  He considered that tho     docisidns arrived at by the Committee it their First     Meeting as now amended would, if approved by the War     Cabinet, solve the priority difficulty.  Ho referred     to an appreciation by the Board of Admiralty of the     Airship Constructions Policy OVar Cabinet Paper     CT.  1912) which was the main question before the     Committoo that afternoon.  The Admiralty asked for     sanction to an increase of a number of L-35 class of     rigid airships from 5 to 16 and that for the main-     tenanoe in commission for War of 70 non-rigid airships,     which was approximately the number existing to-day.     This  programme involved the construction of housing     and building sheds.   He said he had discussed the     matter with the First Lord and they had agreed to     recommend to the Cabinet that a construction shed     should be built at Inchinnan, Barlow and Flookborough     and a double shed at Bedford.   There wore four sheds     already existing.  The construction of the building     sheds would absorb large quantities of mild steel of     which the original estimate was 20,000 tons, which was     afterwards reduced to 7,500 tons,  the balance to bo     made up by other kinds of steel. &quot;These 7,500 tons did     not include 3,000 tons for Flookborough on the reduced     programme*3IR ERIC 03:)D3S and ADMIRAL JELLIC03 urged the imperative     necessity of sanction being  ranted to the rigid air-     ship  programme.  The L-33 wafe a direct copy of the     latest typo of the German 2ep,oelin and these airships     were essential to tho Havy for scouting and reoonnais-     sance purposes.  At present the Germnns could do, in     the way of reconnaissance, with one &quot;eppelin what we     required six light cruisers to achieve.  This gave thd     Germans the advantage of being able to concentrate     their light cruisers for fighting purposes.  Sir Eric     GeddeS described the progress which had been made iii     coping with the danger from inflammable bullots.MR. CHURCHILL gave his reasons for dissenting from the     airship policy but said that if it  was sanctioned     both he and his Department would do their utmost to     carry out the -programme,  which programme,  however,     could not mature until 1919 and * he  questioned  the     wisdom of a tremendous diversion,  at  a critical     period of the war, cf indispensable materials,  of     which the supply was strictly limited,  for the     purposes of a programme which might not be realised     during the V.sr.    As regards the  Government  war     plan he understood that the present jolicy was,  in     order of priority, (.L)  the construction of shl-os to     the utniosb output of rolling mills,  (8)  aeroplanes,     (3) guns-for the  .rmy and flavy,  and (i)  shells,
     It was pointed out * (1) that the chief limitationof the output of aircraft was a shortage of alloy steel-and aluminium-  (2)  The output of steel plates wasregulated by the capacity of the rolling mills whichwould not be increased (3) that large quantities ofsteel had been absorbed in the making of rail3 for theExpeditionary Force in France and elsewhere;, thisquantity was now being reduced;  (4) that the Admiraltydemands for steel were not for warships only, but thegreatest demand was for merchant ships: (5) that theamount of structural steel required for putting uphousing sheds was small ^hen compared with that for con-structional sheds:  (6) that special alloy steel wasfurther essential for the manufacture of machine guns,a neoessary part of :fch.c equipment of aircraft:  (7) thatalthough by breekingfttld ships a considerable number ofpistes would becomo available, the situation would notbe eased thereby, as these plates would require to bere-melted.   In other words, the amount of steel wouldbe increased but this would not lead to any accelerationof the completion of the genrel programme;  (8) that,steel plates were aLjio required for the manufacture ofmines, for which the^Admiralty were making very heavydemands:  (9) that the construction of housing shedsneed not be proceeded with at once provided that suf-ficient stool v?as available for the foundations.     It -.vas suggested that for the next three monthsout of a monthly supply of say, 4,000 tons of buildingsteel, 500 tons might be allotted each month to theAdmiralty for the construction of airsheds and airshipsand the remaining 3,500 tons be devoted by the Air 3oardto essential aerodrome construction and similar purposes.10,000 tons was the total requirement for heavier thansir purposes.   (1U3. These figures arc nominal and forpurposes of illustration only.)     After some dismission, the Committee reached thefollowing conclusions:-     (a)  That the reduced airship programme was     essential and that the sanction of the Vvar     Cabinet to the same should accordingly be     sought.          Mr, Churchill desired that his emphatic     dissent from the above Resolution should be      placed on record and oommunicated to tho frar     Cabinet.     (b)  That the reduced airship programme and     the aeroplane jrogramme, viz,  200 squadrons     to be completed by tho end of 1918,  should     have priority after tho shipbuilding programme,     and that the aeroplane and airship programmes     should run concurrently subject to the proviso     that for the next three months the aeroplane     programmo should have preference  for steel up     to 10,000 tons required for the construction of     air-craft factories end aerodromes,  subject     only to certain liraited requirements of the tfavy     in respect of the construction of airship shed     foundations estimated at 500 tons per month.     (o)  That the completion of these two aircraft     ?ro rainmGB was sufficiently important to justify     the reduction in ths  output of ether munitions     such as shells and rails,  but  that particulars     of such reductions shall be considered later     when the Minister of  munitions can furnish     details, before a final decision  is  reached.
(d)  That the Lteel Allocation Committee of theMinistry of Munitions should meet at theearliest possible date and,  in consultation withspecial representatives of the Admiralty and theAir Board make recommendations to the WarPriorities Committee in regard to the best wayof allocating the available  monthly supply ofsteel for the next four or five months in orderto give effect to the above conclusions.
