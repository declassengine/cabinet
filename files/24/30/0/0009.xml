-TyjQCUmCNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS: BRITANNIC MAJESMY?S  GO-VBRBIN?:  .^ -g.H09.                     WAR   C A B U E T,                          AIR ORGANISATION.                     (Elemorandura by Lord Mllner).           I cannot help feeling, that our position as regards ourruture Air Policy is very far from satisfactory,  and I think&apos; a  furtherdiscussion by the Cab inet on this subject is needed at a very earlylate.   Such discussions, as ,we have had in-the past have usually arisenut cf enquiries in connection with recent Air Raids,  and althoughseveral, important decisions have been reached, I  am not quite clear insy own mind, whether they are altogether consistent with each other,jr wlfther in fact they are being carried cut.           On August 24th the Cabinet (see W.C.22% Minute 12)  decidedto accept in principle the recommendation, of the  Committee,, consistingci&apos; the Arime Minister and General Smuts, to establish an Air Ministry,/1th a. Staff, composed on the lines of the ^^ ^ial^ Generjil^ Staff, asfooii as  possible.   it was also decided that a futher Committee  shouldiiofct at once to work out the details of a scheme  for this purpose, butthat no  public announcement as &apos;to the Cabinet&apos;s decision should  be made,mtil their report had been received and approved by ,the Cabinet.  On .September 21st the Cabinet had Under consideration  certain ccrrespon-dence between the Chief of. the Imperial General Staff  and Sir Douglas&apos;iaig; (see G.To2058) which seemed to indicate some  uneasiness as tothe conclusions vrhich had been reached.   On October 8th we considereda memorandum by - General Smuts (G,Ta2222) suggesting tliat a communicationshould be issued to the&apos; Press to the effect that  the War Cabinet hadiscided in favour of the formation of an Air Ministry,  and that  a Bill^bodying the Government. *s proposals ?;ould be introduced in the  forth-uoiaing session.   On October 15th (see W.C, 249,  Minute  15)  GeneralSauts made a statement to the. Cabinet reviewing the progress  made byai3 Committee on Air re-organisation,,   In this statement he  said thatM-s Committee, had drawn up &apos;&apos;a draft Order in Council prescribing thei^ani s a tion of an Air CounciXVnose &quot;functions In the new Minis try would^-&quot;gspond &quot;with&quot; those performed &quot;by the Board of Admiralty^and jme ArmyIMjAncMl  respectively.   General Srirux-s said that he thought that the Orde:-1m Council would be sufficient for the present for  the  purpose in hand,Mid he did not consider that it would be possible or desirable toPromulgate, a statutory declaration defining the exact powers  of  the Hewministry&quot;&apos;.  He further suggested- that, owing to the number of detailstf-iich would have to be worked cut, the establishment of  a Ministry;&apos;ould take some considerable time.  In view of the  fact  that  it  might;pt be possible to establish the Air Ministry during the course  of theMr he thought that &quot;some Interim arrangement, was necessary for  theco-ordination of air policy&quot;..   The Cabinet&apos; thereupon decided to set up* Committee., with General Smuts In the chair, &quot;to advise  the  War Cabinet,Jail questions of air policy&quot;, and to announce  in the&quot;House of Commonskiat a Bill for the establishment of an Air Ministry was  being prepared   would be. shortly introduced.   This announcement was  made byA Bcnar Law on October 16th,-end a.further statement has  since been;^de to the effect that the Bill in question will be  introduced  duringtfi week after next,
     The proceedings just summarised leave me in a state ofdoubt on - some matters of the greatest importance .. I thought ,that, if there: was one point on which everybody at.all conversantwith the subject-was agreedj it was the necessity of an AirStaff.constantly -reviewing the whole field of Air Policy.,,co-ordinating the requirements of Army and Navy, and devising the -best methods of offence ana defence in the new Art of independentAerial warfare.   Yfithout such a body I cainot imagine, how.we are to know r. either how to make the best use of the machineswe have got or what types of machines we should build in thefuture, and what should be the relative&apos;numbers of the varioustypes 0     Ministry or no Ministry therefore - and I gather that afull-fledged Kiniairy will take some time to contruct - anAir Staff &quot;composed on the lines of the Imperial General Staff&quot;is an&apos; urgent necessityThe Cabinet on August 24th wanted it&quot;as soon  as possible&quot;.  It must have been this object whichGeneral Smuts had in mind in drawing.up a draft order in Councilprescribing the organisation of an &quot;Air Council&quot;..  What hasbecome of  this proposal? .1s the Air Council in existence, oris It hung up pending&quot;the creation of the Ministry of whichit is ultimately to foirma part?  And if it Is so hung up,, whois in the meantime doing the work of that Air Staff which,by common, consent, is so urgently required?  Is it the Committeewhich..has, been appointed &quot;to advise the Cabinet on all mattersof Air Policy&quot;?  If that is to be our only Air Staff, duringthe critical time ahead of us, I.venture to say that thearrangement is quite inadequate .  It is not clear from theminutes of its first meeting (G.T.2340) whether the Committeeis intended to discharge executive functions, or merely togive ad vide,.  Even If the wider view of its functions is taken,,how is It possible for any &quot;Committee&quot; meeting once ortwice a week,, however abTjs itmembers-., to think out theincreasingly numerous and difficult problems of aerial warfareand to control our operations In the Air?     I can well understand that the, setting up of a complete.Air Ministry., the drafting of regulations for anew AirService, must take a,great deal of time and inyclve muchconsultation and negotiation with&apos;, existing Departments..But meanwhile the war in.the air won(t wait.and importantdecisions affecting it have toTbe taken every day by somebodyor other.  Is it really satisfactory that there should be  nocentral authority to.control them?  Fortunately we have gotGeneral Smuts exercising a general supervision, but the super-vision&apos; of a very busy man, with numerous other duties , cannotdo away with, the necessity of a Department - however embryonic -with a definite staff and a clear distribution of duties .It may be,that such Department already exists , or Is in course,of creation.&apos; But nothing on the Minutes of the. Cabinet orin my own recollection of the discussions which have takenplace there, leads me to that conclusion.-  Of course thereis the Air Board.  But the business of the Air Board isConstruction, hot Policy or operations, and Construction Itselfdepends-on Policy .  The whole question is so important, futuredevelopments- in the Air are. surrounded by so many unknownpossibilities) that I feel- that we cannot accept with a lightheart the responsibility of continuing with the ill-definedorganisation, which is all that we at present appear to possess *(Initialled)  M.2, Whitehall Gardens.
