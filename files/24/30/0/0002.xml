(Thlir Document is the Property efHi$ Britannic          Government.)RELEASE (P WINE &amp; SPIRITS FROM  BOND.Memorandum by the Poo-d Controller.\     Under  the  Intoxicating Liquor (Output and Delivery) Order,1917,bated March 29th 1917,  the  quantity of wine and spirits permitted toIG withdrawn from bond  was  restricted to 50^ of. the deliveries which[took place  in 1916,1     The  purpose of  the Order was  to apply to the consumption of wineland spirits restrictions equivalent to those enforced in the case ofI                               ileer.;     The  effect is to create a shortage of wine and spirits as welllas of beer,and  so to accentuate unnecessarily the deficiency ofleverages and stimulants as a whole.  From the point&apos; of view of publicleeds  the action taken  is directly the reverse cf that required.  The[difficulty  of the position  Is emphasised by the fact that the stocksIf wine are very large.   Quite recently restriction on imports fromPortugal  have been removed.1     Strong representations from, the Y?ine and Spirit Trade and&apos; from the[Portuguese  Ambassador have  been received urging the desirability ofpermitting  the  freer issue  of wine and spirits from bond..I     In&quot; view of these considerations,  I am- of opinion that the presentpolicy should be changed and that  we should permit;-^I     1,   The issue of wine  from bond up to theI           pre-war standard.I     2.   The Issue of spirits from bond up to two-thirds ofI           the  pre-war  standard.I     As the point was previously before the Cabinet, I bring thisProposal  to their notice and shall be. glad of early assent thereto.RHONDDA.pipy of Food.October,1917,
