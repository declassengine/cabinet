         (This Document isjhe Froperly^f1 JoGGL *f      PETROLEUM PRODUCTION BILL,Memorandum for the Cabinet Committee. , ,  .    The discussion in the War Cabinet on Friday       morning disclosed that the difficulties that had arisen       on this Bill were of a two-fold character: firstly, the       opposition to establishing in a permanent measure the       right of royalty to land-owners on oil found under the       surface, and secondly, the difficulty of obtaining firms       or persons to act as licensees under the Bill and to       expend capital on any temporary basis.  It appeared to       be generally agreed even by the representatives of the       Labour Party that a temporary measure Y^hich came to an       end on the conclusion of peace would be acceptable.  It       was pointed out, however, that such a course would       probably not meet with acceptance by the proposed       licensees. .            The First Lord of Admiralty suggested a method for       getting over the difficulty,  which I have no doubt your       Committee will investigate.  Eis proposal, however, does       not appear to deal with the principle fundamentally,       while it might prove very expensive to the Exchequer.            My suggestion for me-ting the difficulty is that       the Government, instead of granting licenses under the       proposed Act to other persons should proceed on its own       account and undertake, at any rate for the duration of       the &quot;&apos;ar, both the exploration and winning of petroleum.       i&apos;;ere this course to be adopted it would appear possible,       from the statement of the Attorney General,  to. proceed       under the Defence of the Realms Act and the general       prerogatives of the Grown without any Bill at all.       The matter of compensation to landlords would       automatically go before the Realms Defence Commission,       and the troublesome question of the principle of mining                                1.
 royalties would be eliminated.  Such procedure would be in accordance with a great many actions taken on behalf of the Government by the,Ministry of Munitions both in the establishment and In the requisitioning of industrial establishments during the war.      The objection raised to this course, which seems on the whole more logical and from the Parliamentary point of view much easier than any other proposal, was that no private firm would risk its capital on such a basis. This, I believe, is perfectly true.  No private firm would be expected to sink large sums of money and erect permanent plant on the speculative basis of what it would have to pay to owners of land in one shape or other for the petroleum under their soil.  From a purely business point * of view a royalty of whatever amount but of a definitely ascertained character would undoubtedly be much preferable to any unascertained sum to be determined by a tribunal. This consideration would cease to operate if the Government proceeded on its own account and treated any expenditure incurred as one for war purposes and not as a business proposition.      It may be suggested that it is impossible for the Government to carr: out this work as they have neither the necessary experts nor the plant, while it is represented that there is only one firm in the country, willing to embark in the enterprise.  I find it difficult to believe that the Government cannot obtain very full information from its geological and other authorities as to whether there is any likelihood of success in sinking wells for petroleum In this country.  The actual sinking of petroleum wells is by no,means a complicated ^r difficult matter.  It is a well known operation and there are very many large petroleum firms here and in the United States of America who are quite capable of
taking on this work as agents for the Government.  Norcan I imagine that Messrs. &apos;veatman,.;.Pearson and Co.,Ltd, who apparently seem to be the most active in thismatter would not be prepared on terms of reasonableremuneration to place their experts and staff at thedisposal of the Government. : In view of the patrioticspirit they, have shown right through the war I canscarcely imagine that they, or indeed any other firm,would refuse to give their best assistance.     In this connection there is one point which I wishto bring before the Cabinet Committee, although I donot know whether it Is within their referenceThis isthat a very awkward position indeed may bo created forthe Government if the present scheme is gone on with,and if the before mentioned  firm - as  Iunderstand is likely to be the case - are to be thesole licensees under the Bill.  In itself the Bill is agreat infringement both of the rights of owners ofproperty and of the interests of any Individual who maywish to go in for the exploitation of petroleum.  It isa new departure, creating practically a Government monopolyin petroleum.  It would prevent the land owner fromdealing on the most favourable terms with his property,and would render it impossible for any enterprisingcapitalist to embark on a new enterprise except withGovernment consent.  I do not question for the momentthe necessity for some such step being taken, but Iwould point out that if a firm the head of which ishimself a member of the Governmentwere to obtain underthis Bill a quasi monopoly of the petroleum fields ofthis country the Ministry would find itself open to verystrong, and unpleasant, forms of attack by jealouscompetitors of the licensee firm and by enemies of theGovernment.
     This would all be avoided if my suggestion that theGovernment should undertake the work itself, at any rateduring the war. were adopted*  It may legitimately beasked:  what is to happen after the war to the capitalembarked by the Government?  On this I would point outthat I believe it is possible under the Land AcquisitionAct for the Government compulsorily to acquire thefreehold of the land on which petroleum wells andpermanent works would be situated.  If I am mistaken inmy recollection and such powers do not extend to theperiod after the war a clause giving such compulsorypowers  could easily be inserted in the Bill.  Thiswould mean that at the end of the war the Governmentwould be in permanent possession of the means ofextracting petroleum where it was found practicable,     If the Act were in operation no other person wouldbe in a position to get this petroleum if the Governmentrefused to-grant a licence.  The Government wouldtherefore have it in its own hands entirely on whet termsand under what conditions the industry should continuein peace time, end what remuneration, if any, landlordsshould receive.  If the Government refused to operateitself or to allow any one else to operate the landlord&apos;sInterest in petroleum would become valueless.  Thisposition would, in Itself prevent the landlord fromendeavouring to exact an unreasonable royalty.  If theGovernment desires to dispose of its property to privatetraders after the war it would be at liberty to do soas it could make its own arrangements with regard toroyalties, etc., with the landlords as If the work worebeing done by the State.
ALFRED MOND      In  any case  the present  solution  of  the  question ought not to be governed, by the  consideration of  what is to happen after the war.,   The  importance of obtaining oil in  this country at  an. early date is comparable to the necessity for the Government of providing.itself with many other  materialsc   Many millions of rounds have been  spent  by the  Government  in the  erection of factories of all kinds for war purposes, the value and i&amp;se of which after the war  are entirely problematical, yet no one questions  the propriety of this expenditure.     The whole question really sums itself up  in this one point:  The Government on behalf of the State having proclaimed a monopoly of a valuable material not previously worked in this country can for nationalpurposes exercise very drastic powers with general consent during the war;   and even after the war itwould be in a very strong position to retain the benefit of the,oil wells for the State *  To endeavour at thepresent time to settle what is virtually a barginbetween two sets of private individuals, namely theprivate firm which is to be the licensee and the land owner,  is bound to lead to such divergence of viev-and such criticism as v^ould really endanger the wholeposition not merely of the  Bill but also of theGovernment.
