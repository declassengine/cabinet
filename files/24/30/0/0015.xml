At the end of the three weeksthe man will get on to the&apos; temporary allowance of 14/- a weekunder Article 8 of the Royal Warrant, whilst his family willreceive another fortnight&apos;s separation allowance.  This  s aconcession for which the Minister has consistently pressed,and its delay has recently been the subject of complaint .A further unification in the procedure for dealing withdisabled men in the two services has been effected by placingmen invalided from the llavy for neurasthenia and otherfunctional nervous diseases under the jurisdiction of SirJohn Collie&apos;s Special Medical Board, whose functions wereoriginally confined to soldiers.4.   Pensions to Widows and Dependants.   The work of awardingand authorising payment of Widows and Dependants pensions incurrent cases is completely up to date.          1,097 re-assessments of dependants pensions weremade during the week against 1,634 last  week and 2,748 theweek before.

The rest of  the1,634 receive no benefit, their pensions already being equalto pre-war dependence.          As  a result of  the week&apos;s re-examinations  as  to                                                 entitlement

Treatment.9*  Medical Referees.  The Committee of Selection held twofurther meetings in the course of the past week)- and agreed                                                       on
12! 8on recommendations to the Minister for the appointment ofoome 50 medical referees in counties covering the whole ofIVales, and in Bedfordshire,  Hertfordshire, Huntingdonshire,Berks, Surrey, Cambridge, and Essex.10.  Allowanofes during riedical Treatment at Home.   It hasbeen found that Local Committees are under a misapprehensionas to their ri^ht to pay allowances under Instruction 34 ofthe Instructions for Treatment and Training during the timewhen the man is receiving treatment from his panel practitioner.To remove any doubt on ;* this point an instruction is beingissued&apos;of which a copy is given in Appendix V indicating theconditions in which allowances can be paid in such cases.11.  General Practitioner Treatment in Ireland.  A scheme forthe provision of general practitioner treatment for discharge!disabled men in Ireland on lines similar to those by whichthis privilege is secured for the discharged disabled man,whether insured or uninsured, in the rest of the Plingdom, wassubmitted to the Treasury In June last.  The scheme providedfor  medical treatment being secured through the machineryof the Insurance Commissioners in Ireland.  Objection hasnow, however, been taken by the Treasury to the precise formof this proposal and negotiations are being entered into fora scheme to be worked in concert by the Local GovernmentBoard and the Insurance Commissioners.  In the meantime toprevent any cases of hardship arising, sanction has beengiven to (a) the use of County Infirmaries which have nowbeen established in every County in Ireland and (b) theservices of general practitioners being obtained at therates of remuneration allowed by the Irish InsuranceCommissioners for the domiciliary treatment of tuberculosis.12.  JLedjgal Treatment of British Reservists in Canada.  Theminister of Pensions has been approached by the Canadian                                              Military
Military Authorities with regard to the allowances to bepaid to the wife and family of a member of the ImperialForces residing in Canada while he is under medical treat-ment.  A certain number of reservists of the ImperialForces were resident in Canada at the outbreak of I7ar andthese men on their return to Canada after discharge should,it was felt, have the same treatment as a dischargeddisabled man in this Country.  The Canadian Authoritieshave allowed reservists the full advantages of their schemeof vocational training, together with allowances, as if theywere members of the Canadian Forces.  Arrangements have nowbeen sanctioned by the Treasury for the payment frnrough theCanadian Authorities of allowances at British rates to theman and his wife and family during any period that the manundergoes medical treatment in an institution, while theactual cost of the treatment provided will be borne by theCanadian Government.13.  Meeting of Institutional Committee.  The 26th Meetingof the Joint Committee on Institutional Treatment was heldon the 25th instant,  A report of the Meeting is given inAppendix VI.  It will be seen that a property has beenoffered to and accepted by the Ministry for the treatmentof paraplegia.  The need for convalescent homes andadditional local institutions for in and out-patienttreatment was discussed and the necessity for inquiring asto the districts in which there exists a deficiency ^7a3agreed upon.  Steps are being taken by the Ministry to giveeffect to this.14.  After-Care Colonies for Tuberculosis.  Furtherprogress has been made towards the provision of after-caretreatment, including training, for disabled men sufferingfrom tuberculosis by way of supplement to the treatmentprovided in Sanatoria.  An interim report has now been made                                                        by
13,0by Dr. Bardswell, a prominent authority on tuberculosis,of which a copy is given in Appendix VII. and a conferenceof the Velsh National Memorial Association is being arrangedto discuss the matter at an early date.  The Association arevery anxious to assist, so far as their funds will allow, inmeeting the need and one at least if not two of the Sanatoriaalready belonging to the Association have ample groundsattached to them -which could be used for the purpose oftraining in land cultivation.  Colonel David Davies has -also Interested himself greatly in the matter and isprepared to offer the use of other properties for thepurpose.  The Minister is advised at present that any movein this direction should be of a tentative character; ifonly for the reason that it is entirely uncertain how manymen will be willing to as/ail themselves of the ratherprolonged course (from six months to a year) required foreffective treatment by this method.     Discharged :.len in Asylums.  An Instruction, a copy ofwhich is given in Appendix VIII has been agreed between theMinistry and the Board of Control for issue to theSuperintendents of Asylums to give effect to the arrange-ment now sanctioned by the Treasury by which the Ministrywill be responsible for the cost of maintenance of a mandischarged between the date of admission to the asylum andthe date of classification as a &quot;Service Patient&quot;.  Thearrangement referred to will apply to men dischargeddirectly from military service to an asylum under Section 91of the Army Act, or Section 3 of the Naval Enlistment Act,1884.  The Scottish Board of Control have been asked toissue a similar instruction to Asylum Authorities inScotland.16*  Schemes of Treatment.  Appendix IX contains a reportof the general schemes of treatment submitted and sanctionedduring the week ended the 24th instant.  The Local Committees                                                       of
or Staffordshire, Montgomery* Darlington, have  submittedschemes which will enable them to provide ?:.ll ordinarytreatment without further sanction.  The report  shows thatin some districts the lack of provision for massage at  localHospitals has made it necessary to adopt special arrange-ments for the employment of private masseuses working undermedical supervision.I&quot;7&apos;  Individual Cases of Treatment.  The great bulk ofcases of treatment are dealt with under general  schemeswhich have received approval, but a small number of casesrequiring special treatment or treatment in institutionsfor which approval has not previously been given aresubmitted each week.  During the week ended 24th October,142 such cases were so sanctioned.18.  Numbers under Treatment.  Appendix X shows  the numberof men for whom treatment has been provided under arrange-ments made or approved by the Ministry and to whom allow-ances under Article G of the Royal \:arrant are payable.It will be seen that 349 cases were admitted for treatmentduring the week ended 24th October and that 2,198 men wereunder treatment on that date, as compared with 1,885 menat the end of the previous week,.          The Table shows also the nature of the disablementsfor which treatment was required, and it will be seen thatmore than two-fifths of the cases are of wounds  or injuries,and 5j- per cent cases of paraplegia.  There were 92 case3of neurasthenia under treatment at Croldera Green and 29of advanced tuberculosis in the hospitals of the MetropolitanAsylums Board in London on Wednesday the 24th instant.  Thenumber of discharged men in Lunatic Asylums who  have beenadmitted to the benefit of the special arrangements for&quot;Service Patients&quot; referred to in previous reports was, onthe 24th instant 595.    Of these 21 had been admitted duringthe week.
        Training andEmployment^19- Co-operation of Scotch Education Department.  TheScotch Education Department have been asked whether theywill give their assistance in regard to the training arrangedfor disabled men at Technical and other Institutions inScotland, en the terms to which the Board of Education haveagreed as regards similar instruction in England and Wales.-hile expressing their general readiness to co-operate with:regard to the matter, they have suggested that for thepresent it will be most convenient for Local Committees tomake arrangements directly with the School Boards concerned,and that their Department should only intervene if anyquestion arose which rendered this desirable.20. Training of the Blind.  The principal result of aninterview on the 9th instant with the Secretary ef Gardner&apos;sTrust for the Blind was to set on foot enquiries from  thePrincipal of the Normal College for the Blind at Norwoodas to the ifiacilities for starting a class there in BrailleShorthand and Typewriting for the partially blind.  Workon farms was also; advocated.     ffrade Advisory Committees.  Appendix XI contains areport of meetings held during the week ended the 24thinstant by the Trade Advisory Committees representingGeneral Engineering, Printing and Kindred Trades, Buildingand Boot Repairing.  It shows satisfactory progress.22.  Schemes of Training.  Appendix XII Is a note on schemesof training submitted to the Ministry during the week,23.  Individual Cases of Training.  During the week 41cases of training outside approved schemes were sanctioned.In 128 cases further information was akked for or amodification, of the original proposals suggested.24*  Number of Lien under Training.  Appendix XIII showsthat 78 men were admitted to and discharged from trainingby Local Committees during the week and that the totalnumber reported as under training at the end of the weekwas 604.
                                                       13325.  Risks in Employment of Disabled Men.  A letter, ofwhich a copy is annexed as Appendix XIV  has been sentto the Ministry^ representatives to explain to them thehelpful assurance of the Accident Offices Association that&quot;physically unfit workmen whose disability is due to serviceeither as a sailor or soldier are for all time exempt fromany extra charge&quot; and the view of the Home Office thatdisabled workmen are for certain reasons less rather thanmore liable than others to industrial accident.  TheRepresentatives have been asked to enquire into thehesitation that is nevertheless believed to exist on thepart of some employers to tsdre disabled men on their works.26.  Eccentric Club Hostels.  An interesting account ofthe Eccentric Club Hostels is contained in Appendix XV.The object of these Hostels is to afford every facilityto the Local Committees of the District in which theHostels are situated for ensuring that the men under trainingare well housed, well fed and well cared for and to giveevery encouragement to the men to take up such a course oftraining as will enable them to fill useful spheres in theindustrial life of the nation.  Major Mitchell describesthe origin of the scheme and how by the energy of i/lr.  G.P.Cripps and the great generosity of the members of the  oiuha sufficient sum has been raised to open 10 hostels fullyfurnished and equipped, with accommodation for a total ofabout 350 men; and the club hopes to add to the number ofthese Hostels.                   Organisation.27.  Reports of Inspectors.  Extracts from reports ofInspectors of Accounts for the week ended 24th Octoberare contained in Appendix XVIi  Uith respect to theShipley (&quot;Vest Riding&apos;) Local Committee the Inspector is ableto report improvement and the outstanding advances referred                                                       to

In the South V.&apos;a les Area, re-organisation is promised at Aberdare.  In the SouthWestern Area difficulties are being surmounted by theSomerset Local Committee; in Gloucestershire it wassuggested that the. Civil Liabilities Committees might helpchildless wives in many cases where no aid can be given bythe Local Committee.  Gloucester City Committee hsave notbeen at pains to keep their payments within the regulations;here, as in the County, it was urged that the 14/- temporaryallowance under Article 8 of the Royal Warrant is insufficient,whilst complaint was made as to the great delay in thepayment of pay and allowance to men sent home pendingdischarge;  in Dorset, where the work of the Local Committeeis very satisfactory, the same complaints were made; theorganisation, administration amd local position of thePlymouth Local Committee are all found fault with by theInspector, here too there were general complaints of delayin payments.  In the Southern Area, some of the Hampshiresub-committees appear to be wanting in energy, the worstcase being Farnborough sub-committee who, with a populationof 12,000 to 14,000 only assist 3 cases.          The general question of the non-receipt of payby men sent home on furlough pending discharge is beingtaken up by the Ministry with the Far Office.         The report for Midlothian is much better thanthat in June last.         The Leitrim Local Committee only took up duty onthe 1st June, but during that month no cases were dealt with.28&apos;  Visits of the Minister.  On the 19th instant, theMinister of Pensions accompanied by the ParliamentarySecretary, visited Bolton and received a deputation of therepresentatives of various branches of the Discharged                                              Soldiers
Soldiers and Sailors Association v/ho, inter&apos; alia,complained of cases of alleged hardship due to delay inassessing pensions and protested against an increasingtendency on the part of employers to take account ofdisability pensions when fixing the wages of disabled men.      On the same day the minister received a deputationfrom  the Local Committee who urged that in assessingalternative pensions in cases where there was no profitin the year preceding enlistment the possibility of futureprofit should be taken into consideration.     On the morning of the 20th instant the Ministervisited St Helens and inspected the PiIkington OrthopaedicHospital;  in the afternoon he received the Local Committeesof St. Helens and the adjoining Districts when complaintswere made of the delay between the award and the issue ofpensions, whilst the question of apprentices&apos; earnings wasdeclared to be absolutely inequitable and most serious; inthe evening the minister received a deputation from theCheshire County Hocal Committee who complained of thedelay in obtaining replies to correspondence.     On the 22nd instant, the minister along with theParliamentary Secretary, Major Mitchell and Mr. Oppenheimervisited Wrexham for the purpose ox /iewing Acton Hall.After negotiations between ;.!ajor Mitchell and the UrexhamCorporation, it was agreed that Mr. Oppenheimer wouldpurchase the ilansion and about 140 acres for about  15,000,the other 50 or 60 acres being reserved by the Corporationfor housing purposes.  &apos;drt Oppenheimer expressed hisintention of retaining the Mansion and about 20 acres,the residue of the land he most generously agreed to placeat the disposal of the Minister of Pensions for thebenefit of disabled men.
29, -&quot;Reorganisation of Treatment and Training Division.The work in the third Division of the Ministry (Treatment^and Training) having become so  heavy and serious delayshaving in consequence occurred particularly in dealingwith individual cases, the Minister has decided that the twoBranches should be separated with twp separate Divisions.      Treatment will remain in the charge of Mr. C.F.A.Horewho has had control of the combined branches, and Trainingwill be undertaken by Major R. Mitchell as Director ofTraining,  Major Mitchell.has hitherto acted as TechnicalAdviser to the Ministry in this matter.     -  The staff of both divisions will require someaugmentation particular;y in the higher grades and.communications in the matter are being addressed to theTreasury.

Appendix XVII shows an addition of56 to the staff cf the Ministry during the week,  33 havingbeen added to the Awards to Soldiers Branch and 8 to theAdministration whilst the Special Medical Board with 2 menand 9 women appears for the first time.  The staff on thebpoks of the Ministry now comprises 278. men and 4,509 women,or 4,787 in all.

APPENDIX   V141           TREATMENT.ALLOWANCES DURING MEDICAL TREATMENT AT HOME          Some misapprehension has arisen as to whetherallowances can he paid to a disabled man while he is receivingmedical treatment at home.          Instruction 7 (1) only requires sanction pa ber^ obtainedwhere a Local Committee propose to give and to pay for treatmentat home by a specialist.   Sanction is not required wheretreatment at home is given by the man!s panel doctor withoutcost to the Committee, and allowances under Instruction 34 arepayable in such cases subject to the other requirements of theInstructions, namely     (1)  that the man has been examined by a Medical          Referee who certifies that this form of          treatment is the most suitable to his case,         . tending the appointment of a Medical Referee          the certificate, may be given by the medical          practitioner &quot;usually employed by the Committee          for this purposei      .        v  -;  (2)  that the treatment is required for an incapacity  *      directly caused by or connected with the      conditions of.:the :man.J s disablement&apos;;:-:     &apos; her;  (3). -that the man Is known to be- unable : to-provide;&quot;      for his own support by working.

          TREATMENT.Joint Committee on Institutional TreatmentL      Minutes of Meeting.fti          The twenty sixth meeting of the Committee was held onThursday October 25th 1917 at Westminster House, Millbank.Present, Colonel Sir Arthur Griffith Eoscawen, Chairman.         The Hon. Sir Arthur Stanley.         General Sir George Bullock.         Colonel Sir Alfred Pearce Gould, with         Sir H. fiaward.         Dr. R. Fox-Symons. .         Dr. C. Hubert Bond and         Mr. Hore.               -                        &apos;        -                      fMinutes:  The minutes of last meeting were confirmed, subject totwo formal alterations.Paraplegia:      fa) Dr. R. Fox Symons presented his report showing that1318  cases had been referred to him.   Of these 921 had been dealtwith  leaving 397 still to be provided for.      (b)  Further accommodation:  A general discussion toofc placeas to whether  the Committee should  take  steps to provide  furtheraccommodation  for paraplegics.  Dr. Fox  Symons said that  he didnot think it necessary at  the present time to do so and pointedout that accommodation was provided at the Star and Garter Homefor 64  patients, Lonsdale  House 25, East Lancashire 60, Cheshirefrom  40 to  60, King Edwards VII Home, Cardiff 10 and RalstonHouse.  The  latter place  could accommodate up to 100 patients.  Itwas only in certain counties that he could not rely on accommodation.          It was resolved that for  the present there was  not anyneed  to provide,  further accommodation for paraplegics.      (c) &quot;Lendell&quot; Bromborough.  A  letter dated 24th October fromthe Hon Edward Cozens-IIardy was read relating to this Institutionasking  (l)  the terms of approval,  (2) who would control admissionsto  it,  (3)  how the maintenance charges for In-patients were to bemet.    The  Committee decided to recommend to the Ministry that alatter  be written stating that (1)  the acceptance  of the  offer hadbeen  approved  of by the Committee and accepted by  the Ministry, (2) that Dr. Fox Symons would control admissions that were trans-ferred  from Military Hospitals and  the Local War Pensions Committeethrough the County Director would control local post-dischargecases,  (3)  that  the Ministry of Pensions would provide the usualmaintenance charges up to  2.2.0 and further that  preference shouldbe  given to cases from Birkenhead and that the  Institution shouldbe  solely for  Paraplegic  cases.Neurasthenia:  North Muskham Grange:  A  letter dated October 19thfrom  j-...r. Thos. L.R.Ldge was read containing a proposal to utilisethis  house  as  a  home for  soldiers suffering from shell shock.  TheSecretary was  instructed  to write to ivir. Edge and  ask for particularsas  to the terms  on which  the property was being offered.
143Elilepsy:  Chalforit. Dr. Bond reported that  in connectionwith the letter dated 16th October from Mr.  Fenn-Gaskell toCaptain Lane referred to at the last.meeting he had seen Mr.Penn-Gaskell, explained the Ministry&apos;s attitude, and discussedthe matter with him generally.   The authorities at Chalfontwere now willing to admit men to the Colony  wearing whateverclothing they arrived in.    After admission they could weartheir own clothing or that provided by the Institution, suchclothing to remain the property of the Colony authorities.  Itwas decided to recommend to the Ministry that the cost ofclothing suv&quot;; lied to patients be provided by an extra capitationfee..Tuberculosis; Institutions for -officers.  A  general discussiontook place on the necessity for providing one or moreinstitutions for Tuberculous officers.  It was pointed out thatLady Dudley managed on behalf of the Red Cross the placing of &apos;officers in Convalescent homes.  At present  there was difficultyin fidning accommodation for officers in the early stages ofTuberculosis..  Sir Alfred Pearce Gould undertook to discussthe matter with Lady Dudley and to bring the question againbefore the Committee, if further accommodation was found to benecessary.Convalescent Homes:  A:.generalrdiscussion took place withregard to the provision of Convalescent homes.   It wasrepresented that there was a demand for such homes in theMidlands, where there was a deficiency not only of such homes,but also of Cottage Hospitals in which such cases might betreated without overburdening the available accommodation atseaside places.   It was  decided to make a general inquiry asto the extent of the need for such Institutions,  the localitiesin which additional Homes would be most useful  and the sizeof building required.   Sir Arthur. Stanley said  that on receiptof this information it was probable that satisfactory arrange.--ments could be  made tjy the Red Cross  Society to meet thedifficulty..
APPENDIX  Vll         TREATMENT.THE FARM COLONY FOR TUBERCULOSIS.  INTERIM REPORT BY DR.  BARDSVELL.        De-finltJion of          The term &quot;Farm Colony&quot; is employed loosely and withno generally accepted definition.  It has been used t^ describetwo schemes for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis.     (1)  A centre for the exclusive reception of the early andmost curable cases with a view to giving them prolonged treat-ment and a training in some healthy and remunerative employment.     (2)  A centre for the reception Of consumptives in allstages of the disease&apos;.  This will comprise under the samegeneral administration a training school for curable cases justreferred to, a department for the cases somewhat more advanced,some of which would in time, qualify for admission &apos;to thetraining school, and a.home&apos;for the advanced and hopeless cases.It is proposed further that some means of permanent employmentbe established, thereby enabling some.of the patients tp settleand f^rm a nuicleus ^f a consumptive community, living undergarden city conditions.          Both these conceptions of a Colony:- the term &quot;FarmColony&quot; is a misnomer, since a farm is not necessarily Includedin such a Colony scheme, represents Only a slight modificationOf the best existing sanatoria.     Scheme 1 would attempt what sanatoria have hitherto failedto accomplish, namely to secure the exclusive admission of themost promising cases, but it would differ from these Institu-tions in the provision for a systematic training which wouldgreatly increase its usefulness as compared  with sanatoria,would be that residence instead of some three months wpuld beof spime twelve , months duration.     Scheme 2 would differ from most sanatoria in that aceommo-dation would be provided for advanced and hopeless cases  andthat a department an the lines of Scheme 1 would be organisedfor the benefit of those patients whQ were in the early stages,or the more advanced who were likely, notwithstanding, to makean economic cure.  It is strongly urged by Col.  G. Sims^oodhead that the -facilities for learning some occupationshould be given to all who have any capacity for work, not tothe most favourable cases only.  Further, that the treatmentof advanced cases in a department of the same institution as theless advanced, is at once more humane and the mnre efficient &apos;policy.  On these grounds Col. G. Sims Woodhead and hisassociates favour this scheme. -       The Necessity for some further provision than Sanatoria.          It is a matter of general knowledge that while  manyconsumptives of the better classes are restored permanently tohealth and capacity for work as the result of treatment andeducation in a sanatorium, yet on the other  hand, the statisticsof sanatoria for the working classes give a discouraging  pictureof what institutional treatment can effect for them.  But thefactors which make for failure are equally well appreciated:these are too short a duration of treatment  in the sanatorium,                                                      discharge144
145discharge in a state of incomplete cure, and return to un-favourable ocnditions, such as an unhealthy occupation,uncertain or inadequate y/age, or unsatisfactory housing.  Toteach the consumptive of the working classes an occupationwhich promises him his normal standard of livelihood, and ahealthy environment, would he to solve, at any rate to a largeextent, the difficult problem which he presents.  Alternatively,to give him some twelve months1 treatment instead of two orthree, and meanwhile to make an adequate provision for hisdependants, would, apart from any re-education, improve hisoutlook materially.  He would return to his home furtheradvanced on the road to. recovery, so that with some after-care,such as shortening the hours of work, anu for a time at least,some financial assistance, he might in many instances return tohis ordinary occupation, with no little success.          Hitherto, from lack of public funds, neither prolongedtreatment nor re-education have been possible, as a generalpolicy.  What they would effect if adopted systematically timeonly can show, but the Colony would be an experiment on hopefullines.  Whatever may be the prospect for the civilian, in viewof the funds available, the scheme proposed is within the reachof the ex-soldier.       Evidence in favour  of the Colony.Principles afforded by       the experience of Sanatoria.          To guide us In this undertaking we are now in aposition to formulate certain principles afforded by theexperience of Sanatoria, and these are in favour of the Colonyscheme.  Ivianv, nrobably all sanatoria present striking examplesof the efficiency of suitable employment - and this implies pro-?longed     ttiifciV - among their personnel.  To name two only;at Peppard Common over 50$ and at Nayiand some 70;? of the staffis made up of former patients.  These are all earning theirliving;  some on the permanent staff to all appearances cured;.others will remain for a year or two, to return then to theoutside world:  others again will remain indefinitely,  perform-ing work within their capacity, partially disabled for all  time,but by no means &quot;bouches inutiles&quot;.          Sirmilarly, after-care organisations furnish manyinstances of the maintenance of full capacity for work by con-sumptives for whom healthy but remunerative work has been pro-cured.  That the principles underlying the Colony scheme aresound perhaps need not be  insisted upon, it is more a  questionof how far they can be put into practice on a large scale.       The kind of re-education suggested.          Agricultural work of some kind is  most commonly pro-pcsed;  general farming;  market gardening;   fruit growing;poultry rearing etc  Latterly the success  in re-educating  thedisabled soldier has suggested the teaching of some of  thetrades which can be followed without detriment to  health, suchas carpentry, simple mechanics, various  kinds  of handicrafts.       The prospects of success of re-education.          To what extent the consumptive after a course  of  some12 months&apos; treatment and instruction, would  be rendered  selfdependant, that is to say  able to compete successfully  in theopen labour market, cannot be  stated.          The only data available upon which to form any                                                    conjecture
4146  conjecture are furnished by the life histories of patients who  had given up a familiar but unsuitable employment for something*  unfamiliar but meeting better his special requirements.  The  study of these data is not very encouraging.            The causes of failure are chiefly lack of skill, with  resulting lessened earning c&amp;pacity and inadequate wage, and  lack of capital cr income from other sources to tide a man over  the Initial period&apos;of relatively unskilled and unremunerative  work.  These adverse factors the colony would hope to eliminate.  Certainly the trained ex-soldier, with his pension as a guarantee  cf a minimum wage, and greater initial skill, would stand a  rnuich better chance of success than the civilian has ever enjoyed.            The most useful Occupations.            The writer has attempted to gather from the data just  referred to some indications as to the occupations which afford  the best prospects to the consumptive.  It appears impossible  to draw any conclusions of general application. In one  district it is one trade or ocisupacion, in another something  altogether different.  A study of rural and urban life  respectively gives two entirely diverse pictures.  Nearly  every trade has its relatively light and less well paid jobs.  These are what the After-care Committees seak to obtain for  their patients, but which often prove unsatisfactory because  of the small wage paid to them.  With the assistance of a  subsidy represented by his pension much is open to the ex-  soldier in this way which is impossible to the civilian.            In pre-war days many sanatoria helped men tft a living  wage and good conditions by teaching them motor driving.  Recently, warnings have appeared In the press stating that,  after the war, the market for cphauffeurs will be flooded.            Farming and allied Occupations.            Speaking generally, the urban consumptive finds it  very difficult to make a living by any form of agriculture.  Farming and every^ occupation akin to it, Is to be regarded as  skilled work, and for the most part requiring capital.  What  unskilled work it offers is arduous and poorly paid.  Moreover  to the town bred the country offers small attraction.  It would  appeal with more force if to an offer of training were added  the certainty of subsequent employment and reasonable means of  recreation and social life,  in-the case of the man born and  bred in the country it is a different matter.  In rural  districts a consumptive, even though considerably handicapped  by his illness, usually contrives to earn a wage;  he is used  to his life, with all its limitations;  its interest to him is  old habit.            An agricultural training undoubtedly would assist  those who ha&amp; left the land in early youth to go back to it;  it would also encourage both town and country dwellers to take  up allotment gardening.  The experience of Sanatoria which  have good kitchen gardens is definite on this point.            Again I have noted in rural areas that men with small  pensions such as ex-policem3n, and old service men,  and persons  having in addition some trcds, not infrequently run  small market  gardens or a combination of fruit and poultry raising, or fruit  and vegetable growing, and with the income from the  two sources  make a fair or cornier oablo living.  As to a thorough trs iring  In general farming, there exists undoubtedly a small number of                                                      suitable
147suitable patients possessed of capacity and character who wouldtake full advantage of an opportunity for a training, with aview, in many cases, to emigration.  A farm colony for thissmall number of selected men would supply a want and prove asuccess *          It is perhaps of interest to note, apropos of farmcolonies, that at least two long established and efficientSanatoria for the working classes possess farms upon which thepatients never set foot as workers.  Both are run at a profitby a staff of healthy labourers;  The explanation given atboth institutions is that they have no demand for work on afarm, and that in any event it is preferable to employ theavailable patients * labour in the grounds and gardens where Itcan be lighter and less continuous, better supervised and morereadily utilised to the best advantage.  The invalided man,too, needs longer and more frequent rest.  Moreover the stay ata sanatorium is too short to allow of serious attempt at anagricultural training.  It is also worth recording that at bothof these institutions mentioned which are in quite differentdistricts, the native countryman objects to working alongside ofmen whom he regards as strangers from the towns, and beingexpected to impart his skill to them.  The attitude appears tobe a sort of tacit trades unionism.          As to the prospect generally of settling the consump-tive on the land, and the means that should be adopted, thereport of the Departmental Committee upon &quot;the settlement or theemployment on the land of discharged soldiers and sailors&quot; ismost pertinent, and interesting.  A central training farmendowed with skilled, instructors, in short, an agriculturalcollege in association with a number of centrally directededucational small holdings organised with co-operative buyingand selling, are the lines recommended by this Committee.When reading this Report, especially as to the difficultieswhich the Committee anticipate, it must be remembered that theyhave In mind the education of the man discharged healthy andsound.  In applying the scheme to consumptives the difficultieswill be intensified, but they can be lessened if a rie&quot;idprinciple of selection of candidates for training be adopted          Handicrafts and Trades.          As to the feasibility of teaching the consumptive asuitable trade, there is not much evidence to guide;  the successwith the training of chauffeurs has been referred to.  The     &apos;.:.ftraining of carpenters, painters and handymen has also provedencouraging.  The young unmarried man of natural resource andpush, who having made himself useful doing all sorts of jobs inand about the Sanatorium, has emigrated and made good, is anencouraging example of which most Institutions can give manyinstances.          At several sanatoria pioneer work has been done, and acertain success achieved in the teaching of rough repairs,painting, boot repairing, toy making, arw&apos; mat and basket making;but nothing more ambitious has been attempted&apos;  When a certaintrade Is examined closely one learns TIOA nignly developed it is,and how specialised and long the training required, if realcompetency is aimed at.  In many industries an apprenticeshipof five years or more is a rule;  such would seem to be quiteoutside the scope of a Colony.  It is a question whether sucha long training is really necessary.  I am informed that a six ;months&apos; training under competent instructors would qualify anapt patient as an ordinary journeyman.  In many trades, however,there exist certain processes in which a man may specialise.                                                           In
148In-manufacturing centres these special occupations, termed inthe trade &quot;repetition work&quot;, are well paid;  once learnt theydemand no particular skill, It being a case merely of minding amachine.  It should be possible to do something on these linesat a Colony.          With respect to the various occupations covered by theterm &quot;engineering&quot;j a Colony with a simple equipment could givea general mechanical training sufficient to make a low grademechanic.  It would be of some value in itself and a basis forfurther instruction at a Technical College.  The instructionat a Colony should give a knowledge of the use of tools forworking in wood and metal, of simple machinery such as latchesand engines for small power and lighting plants, of carpentry,of electric appliancesj of wiring and fitting, of painting andpapering, and of what builders call &quot;repairs .  There areopenings for this kind of handyman as house carpenters inInstitutions, factories and on Estates.          The training is of a kind which can be applied inmany ways by a resourceful and steady man.  The handyman witha knowledge of gardening top should command a market.          Boot repairing offers a means of living, and needslittle apparatus for Its instruction.  Thus to a large extentthe technical training at a Colony can be but of general andpreliminary character.  The men who show aptitude, and havemade sufficiently good recoveries, could with the aid of theirpensions move on to a centre provided with all that is necessaryfor the teaching of some specific trade of their election.  Thewriter has in his mind a patient he saw recently.  Originally ashop assistant he joined the Army and was subsequently invalidedwith.early pulmonary tuberculosis.  Tubercle Bacilli werepresent in his sputum.  After some months&apos;  residence in asanatorium where facilities for carpentry etc. are given, he madea good recovery.  His pension then enabled him to go to atechnical school, and go through a course of instruction in thecare of internal combustion engines.  He has since obtained apost as driver mechanic of an agricultural tractor.  It is forsuch careers that the Colony would r$ive some preparation.          The writer has had no time as yet to look into thework f)f organisations such as t,he Association for theDevelopment of Village Industries, and of various workshops forthe partially disabled.  They can certainly afford informationof value *          The tendency to return to a former occupation.          It is within the knowledge of all with a longexperience of the consumptive working classes that patients arestrongly disposed to return sooner or later, to their originaloccupations, whether in town or country.  Commonly enough, ifs^ome more healthy occupation than that formerly followed, istaken up, it Is used as a means of getting back to health, andtc a resumption of the old life.  This conservatism is ofcourse, most marked with the elder men.  Though habit andassociation play a part, it is the result largely of economicpressure.  Experience suggests then that a Colony is likely toachieve success more by virtue of the prolonged treatment itwill allow of, than by aiming at any special training.          The experience of existing Colonies.          There exist to-day at Edinburgh and Leicester,                                                        Colonies
Colonies for the continued treatment and education of theapparently cured and seemingly most curable.  At the EdinburghColony, a beautifully situated place close te the City, there arefacilities for learning something of the general farming, marketgardening, pig rearing and poultry keeping.          At Leicester the training is limited to market garden-ing, including the growing of fruit and vegetables under glass.There much is done to make the life agreeable.  The routineallows of considerable freedom, games, including a billiardtable, and newspapers are provided, and the colonists are allowedto go home from Saturday afternoon to Sunday night.  Neither atEdinburgh nor Leicester ai&amp;e the Gsl6ni.es i although serving a .useful purpose, fulfilling the intentions of their promo tors *It appears that&apos;the type of patient desired is not attracted bythem.  He is able to work, and without difficulty can secure agood wage.  Under the circumstances it is perhaps notsurprising that he prefers his usual home life to residence  ina Colony.          Pri^r tp the war, however, I understand this difficultydid not exist at Edinburgh or to but a small extent.  Work wasless readily obtained.          &quot; he Leicester Colony dates from 1914.  At present thestate of the labour market is abnormalj  there Is work and agpod wage even for the inefficient.  It can be urged withjustice that the Colonies just named are not altogether corn-parable with the proposed Colonies for ex*soldiers.  At theformer the training offered is limited to agriculture, whichcan make but, a small general appeal to former town workers withno certain prospect q  such employment.  Again the civilianwith only a small weekly income derived frojn his sick pay ismore tempted    leave the Colony for a good,wage than is thesoldier in receipt of a pension.  The experience of Edinburghand Leicester is not so discouraging as on first impressionswould appear.          Provisional Conclusions.          Until some experience has been gained, it would seemunwise to embark on any highly organised and costly Colonyscheme.  Under present conditions the necessary experimentalwork cQuld be carried out most&quot;conveniently in a district andwell defined department of existing Institutions for the treat-ment of tuberculosis.  The advantages offered by this arrange -ment are that:-     (1)  A supervising staff experienced in the treatment ofconsumption is instantly made available, a point of great momentwhen many sanatorium beds are now closed for lack of a skilledstaff.                                    i  ... . (2)  The capital outlay would be much reduced,  manyexpensive needs such as water supply, drainage, light,  powerand transport being already provided for.     (3)  All new buildings and equipment,  after serving theirimmediate purpose, would be of value tft the  parent  Institution.          Preference would be given to Institutions  which havefarms, or could readily obtain them,  and whose  land is  suitablefor cultivation.   The possession of a power  house with steamand electricity would bo a further advantage.
          For the farm an experienced bailiff would be required,and a nucleus of sound labour at the rate of four or five menper hundred acres of land.  This labour could be diluted by thepatients1 labour, but not displaced.  For the gardens a workinginstructor would be wanted, but, if not more than five acres inextent, no further sound labour would be needed.  There areadvantages of beJng within eaoy access of a considerable town,such as cheaper transport and better markets for produce.  Atthe Edinburgh Colony pig rearirg gives a handsome profit.Taking ad wantage of its proximity to Edinburgh it contracts forthe waste- of large hotels, restaurants etc., which, collectedand sterilized, form a valuable and cheap source of food for thepigs.  For the technical training I would, suggest the erection,in wood, of a large well lighted and airy workshop, with anupper storey for use as a lecture and demonstration room.  Theequipment would depend upon the training undertaken.  Its exactcomposition would be a matter for skilled advice, such astechnical colleges could supply.  The workshop and equipmentwould cost at least  1,000.          The immediate requirements for patients, supposing theColony to be grafted on to an existing Sanatorium, would besimple accommodation in wooden buildings.  Then ccst, withequipment, would probably amount to some  50 per bed.  If, asat the little settlement at Bourn,  the patients themselveslargely erected their own quarters, some economy would beeffected.          At the Centres for the re-education of woundedsoldiers in France the men receive  wages.  The wage is creditedto the Man&apos;s account, and on his discharge he withdraws it, andthus starts his new life with a little capital.  This principlemight with(advantage-  be adopted at a Colony, a part of a man&apos;spension being reserved for the purpose.          In this Memorandum I have not touched on severalpoints which are pertinent to the Colony question;  such asthe attitude of employers generally to consumptives, the value,as estimated by foremen instructors, of  consumptive labour toany Institution, and the question of payment to patients at aColony for this work;  these two last problems  bearing upon thecost of maintenance, and so again upon the possibility ofestablishing subsidized trades for  ex-Colonists.      P.S. I have noted some disinclination to an education onthe part of ex-soldiers, on the grounds  of fear of the pensionsbeing abolished or reduced.  They prefer a certain pension toa possible living at some new calling.   This question ofpension calls for some official notice  to the men concerned.                          H.R.
APPENDIX   Vlll15                       TREATMENT.      Supplementary instructions relating to the Classification             of Discharged Soldiers and Sailors as &quot;Serviceb                        Patients&quot;.  1m        In supplement of the &quot;Instructions relating to the  Classification and Treatment of Soldiers and Sailors as  &quot;Service patients&quot; issued on the 27th June last, arrangements  have now been made by tne Minister of Pensions tith the santion  of the Treasury whereby, in future any soldier or sailor discharged  from service in the present war on account of insanity and who  is admitted to an asylum on such discharge -under the procedure  referred to in Instruction 3 hereunder will be maintained at  the cost of the Ministry of Pensions during the period between  the date of admission and the date on which the Superintendent  is notified that the man is or is not entitled to be classed as  a Service patient.  2,        The date as from which the Ministry of Pensions will be  responsible for such maintenance will be the 10th October or the.  date of admission if later.  3.        Cases for which the Ministry of Pensions will thus be  responsible are those of men admitted to County and Borough  Asylums directly on discharge from service Under Section 91 of  the Army Act or Section 3 of the Naval Enlistment Act 1884,  including (a) men at present in the Asylums in respect of whom  notification has not yet been received from the Pension Issue  Office that the man is or is not entitled to be classed as  a  service patient;  (b)  men admitted to asylums in future under the  enactments referred to.    Every  man so admitted should be regardedv during the interim period as a private patient and should on  admission be entered on the books as such.  4&apos;    &apos;    In the cases referred  to in the  preceding  paragraph,  accounts for the maintenance of  the men for  the  period between the                                                             date
152date oi&apos;  admission or  the  10th October 1917 (whichever is the later)and the  date  of  notification by Pension Issue Office should beforwarded to  Pensions Issue Office.   It the man becomes a.service  patient  the account for maintenance of the patient priorto the date of notification should be forwarded with the quarter-ly account prescribed in paragraph 9 of the Instructions of 27thJune 1917.   If  the man is declared not to be entitled to be aservice  patient  the account for maintenance up to, the date ofnotification should be transmitted to the Pension.. Issue Officeimmediately upon such notification.5,        During this interim period the cost of maintenance forwhich the Ministry of Pensions will be responsible will be cal-culated at the current weekly pauper rate, not including theadditional items of charge numbered  (b) (c) and (d) in paragraph9 of the  Instructions.6.        In any case where the Superintendent is notified byPension..Issue Office that the  man is not entitled to., be a servieepatient the Guardians of the Union to which the man is chargeable *as shown  on the  Statement of Particulars accompanying theReception 0rderfshould at once be communicated with, and informedaccordingly.    As from the date at which notification is given byPension Issue Office the Guardians become liable for the man!smaintenance unless he is otherwise provided for by relatives.7*        It is  important that application should be made toPension Issue Office as soon after a man&apos;s admission to theasylum as possible, and the directions given in paragraph 4,  5and 6 of the  Instructions issued on the 27th June 1917, shouldnot be read as meaning that Superintendents should delay appli-cation to Pension Issue Office for supplementary  information asto the man*s  condition.

ThisCommittee further submitted a proposal to use the localY/strkhcuse Infirmary for in and out-patient treatment.  From.the context of their letter it was doubtful ?/hether thisInstitution was being utilized as a V.AeD. Hospital for thepurpoce cf providing treatment to serving soldiers, and furtherenquiry is being made on this point.3.        The Staffordshire Local Committee have submitted adetailed scheme embodying arrangements or proposed arrangementsfor the provision of almost every class of treatment likely tobe requiredo  The use of all the Military Hospitals mentionedin their scheme, including several special Institutionsoutside the area of the Joint Advisory Committee was sanctionedand the proposal to utilize for special out-patient treatmentthe VLACDo Hospitals at Leek, Smethwick, Ravenhill, Sandon,Eccleshall and Stone was approved.

             The Stirlingshire Local Committee, submitted a   limited scheme, of which the only Institution approved was the  Stirling Military Hospital.  Inadequate information was  furnished concerning the other institutions, and furtherS enquiries have been made-  5,        The Pembrokeshire Local Committee submitted a scheme  merely embodying the Military and Auxiliary Hospitals in their  area.  These have been approved, but further enquiry was  necessary as to the arrangements for the provision of other  classes of treatment.  6.        The York Local Committee received sanction to use the  Royal Northern Sea Bathing Infirmary, Scarborough.  7,        The Isle of Wight and Buckinghamshire Local Committees  each submitted proposals to utilize several local Institutions,  but as further enquiry was necessary the question in bath  instances was referred to the Ministerfs Representative for the  area.  r:.        Sanction has been given to the use of the Turkish  Baths and Electrical Massage establishment, Middlesbrough at a  charge of  1* 5, C for a course of 8 treatments.  No.military or V,A,D. institutions in the neighbourhood provide  similar treatmentc  P*        In view    the lack of provision for massage and  electrical treatment in Cumberland, sanction has been given  to., the &apos;&quot; or king ten and V/hitohavsn Committees to use the services  of a private ^qualified) masseuse at fees which are somewhat  in excess of the usual, but sanction is provisionally  limited to a month In order to.enable the Local Committees  concerned to negotiate through the D.D4M..S* for the provision  of massage at one of the military or V-A-D. hospitals.  Similarly,  the services of a Masseuse at  3 a week have been engaged at  Carlisle by the Joint Committee for a period of two months.

In order to avoid the duplication of Committees it wasdecided to set up one Local Technical Advisory Committee In eachof tho large centres of the Engineering Industry to cover allbranches cf Engineering.   This Committee will be elected by theEngineering and Shipbuilding Federation on the Trade Unionistsside and by the Engineering Employers1 Federation on theEmployers&apos; side and will thus be formed on exactly the same modelas*the Trade Advisory Committee.Printing and &quot;Kindred Trades, Sub Committee.;          An agreement has now been arrived at with regard to allthe main processes in Printing and the kindred trades with theexception of bookbinding which is still under discussion.   Therecommendations of the -&amp;ub Committee will be brought up at themain Committee next week.                                                    \          V/ith regard to process work the period of trainingsuggested is two years of training under maintenance,  the firstyear to be spent in the technical school and the second year inthe workshop.   During the second year the employer would pay10/-.Building.          The Report was received from the Executive Committee ofthe Carpenters and Joiners announcing their refusal to acceptthe scheme of the Sub Committee.   The Building Trade  AdvisoryCommittee unanimously decided to appoint a deputation consistingof three Trade Unionists and three Employers to meet theExecutive Committee of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters andJoiners.          At a previous meeting the Committee had decided to setup separate  Local Technical Advisory Committees for the differentcrafts within the Building Trade.   At this meeting the Committeereversed its previous decision and decided to set up one  compositeLocal Technical Advisory Committee in each of the large centresof the Industry.          The recommendations with regard to Painting,  Plumbing,Masonry, Bricklaying and Plastering were all approved  of  and havebeen sent forward to the Ministry of Pensions..Boot Repairing.          To signalise the completion of the Report and as  arecognition of the friendly relationships that  have existed betweenthe representatives of employers and workpeople a luncheon  wasgiven&apos;by the Chairman of the Committee,  Mr. Box Kingham,  at  whichboth the Minister of Pensions and the Minister  of Labour  werepresent.          The Committee  at its meeting in the afternoon havingnow disposed of the Report proceeded to  consider  some  of  thedifficult questions of administration, particularly that  of  securingadequate training for boot and shoe repairers in  districts whereno Local Technical Advisory Committee existed.

It was  suggested that the dliTicultlec  in providing this  training which  would last from 6 months to a  year, might be overcome by the Government contributing towards  the purchase of  a  going concern where  50 men  could be  trained^  and of which the cost would  ultimately be defrayed from  the  sale of  fruit.t   The proposal was considered  to be outside what  the Ministry can properly undertake..

MINISTRY OF PENSIONS,                                              V/estminster House%                                                  Millbank,  S.W.1\Dear Mr,              The suggestion  has been made to the Minister thatemployers in some instances have hesitated to employ dischargeddisabled men from a fear that their employment would involve ahigher premium to meet their  liabilities&apos; under the Workmen^Compensation Act or (in the case of the uninsured man) the pay-ment of compensation in case  of  accident, where but&apos;for the  man&apos;sdisablement no accident would have occurred.              This fear if it exists at all is based on twopossible considerations namely:-     (a) That Insurance Companies will put up the premium against               the employer,  because of the mere fact of his               employment of  disabled men and     (b) That disabled men are more liable to industrial accident               than others.              With regard to  (a) the Ministry has been definitelyassured by the Accident Offices  Association,  which comprises allthe largest Assurance Corporations, that &quot;physically unfit work-men whose disability is due to service either as a sailor orsoldier are for all times exempt from any extra charge&quot;,   More-Over, in order to remove any  possibility of doubt on this scorewhich might be occasioned by  the terms of the forms to becompleted by the employer in  respect of his policy, it has beendecided by the Association to delete from such forms  anyquestion relating to physical disabilities of workmen,  other thanlead-poisoning, and new forms of proposal will be circulated inwhich the former question as  to  whether the employer  has  knowledgeof any such disabilities will be omitted.   Clearly if this is  the                                                   attitude
attitude of the Acoident--Ofjfices,.Aasoclai^oir- smaller- Societieswill toe driven to fall into line in so far as any question cfadditional premium is concerned.                As to (to) we are informed toy the Home Office thatin their view, and they speak with some experience, disabled work-men are not more but,less liable to industrial accident, partly nodoubt because they exercise naturally greater care, but alsoprobably because the employer sees that the men have the lessdangerous work.               The Minister would be obliged if you would furnishhim with the results of your experience, if any, in regard to thequestion of the hesitation on the part of employers to employdisabled men for the reasons indicated and in particular he wouldbe glad to know:-     (i) Whether Local Committees have brought to your noticeany case in which such hesitation has been shown.    (ii) If any such cases have been brought to your notice,what class of employment or employer have been concerned.   (iii) Whether any evidence has come before y^u to show thatdisabled men have met with industrial accidents under circumstanceswhich would point to their disablement being a contributory cause.    (iv) TThether any suggestions have been made to you or cometo ycur knowledge for meeting the difficulty of reassuring orsafe-guarding the employer assuming that employers have expressedany feeling in this direction.  In making enquiries on thesepoints please consult any Chairman or Secretaries of DisablementCommittees who would be likely to give you reliable information.                It might be useful also to consult substantialrepresentatives of employers, but in doing so you will, of coursemake no suggestion as to the possibility of any financialprovision..to be made by the Ministry.                The assurance given by the Accident OfficesAssociation which you will of course be at liberty to quote willit is hoped remove any difficulty that may exist.  I should bemuch obliged if you could let me have a reply in a week&apos;s time.                           Yours very truly,
                     APPENDIX  XV              THE ECCENTRIC CLUB HOSTELS,          In the early days of the Training, of Disabled Men, those who left Roehampton after a partial Training were by arrangement sent forward to the Regent Street Polytechnic for a period of from 4 to 6 months to complete their Training.          The difficulty of providing suitable accommodation for the increasing number of men became apparent, and I approached Mr. G.P. Cripps with the view of his helping to provide a Hostel for the Men.  He at once generously offered me rent free the-upper part of the premises at 77 Hanover Street, Hanover Square, and,at the saire time handed me a cheque for  360 to cover  cost of furnishing it for about 40 men.          In considering the probable cost of maintenance I decided to see Mr. Cripps again, which I did when I explained that in view of the probability of the Hostel being required for a  period of at least 3 years I did  not see how the movement could be started free from financial wgrries  under a sum of at least  1000, and suggested he should talk  overwith some of the members of the Eccentric Club and seewhether such a sum could be raised.   This he did and on the following morning the Secretary of the Club wrote me saying 1000  had been deposited in our joint names for the first Eccentric Club Hostel - 17 Hanover Street was  then furnished&apos; and was opened by theRt. Hon. G.N.  Barnes  the Minister  gf Pensions on April 20th.          Subsequent gatherings of the Club were  held  and theneed of more Hostels being put before the notice  of the members, several amounts were raised and frequently as  much as  2000 was subscribed in a single  evening.   Sir Charles and Lady Wyndham lent the New Theatre for a Matinee whichrealised  800 and Lady Wyndham organised a  Matinee at  the Criterion and she appeared in her  old part  of  &quot;The Mollusc&quot;.                                ...                    This
                                                            16.2This was also a very successful entertainment and realisedover  500.  Mr. Y:alter de Freece played  the  part ofAuctioneer at some of the Club Dinners with  such successthat soon the sum of  10,000 had been realised.  The burdenof  the work rested on Mr. G.F. Cripps to whose energy andinterest the success of the scheme is mainly due.  Mr. JamesWhite gave  1000 towards a Hostel to the memory of CaptainBall&apos;V.C.  This was opened on July 4th by Brigadier GeneralCharlton, C.B., D.S.O.  General Sir Francis  Lloyd opened theAnnexe to the Soho Square Hostel.          The Rt. Hon. G.N. Barnes accompanied by Sir ArthurGriffith Boscawen opened 16 Hanover Street and Farkers Place,the former premises being lent by W.H. Smith &amp; Son and thelatter by Messrs. Peter Robinson.          The first provincial Hostels opened were provided by  theYorkshire Members of the Club, and 2 splendid buildings havebeen placed at the disposal oft he Club for  the purpose, onebeing lent by the Corporation of Barnsley and the other by  oneof the principal Firms in the town.  The next to be opened  wasalso In the provinces and was opened by the Rt. Hon. John Hodgeat Brighton to provide accommodation for the men in Training asDiamond Cutters, and Mr. Oppenheimer as member of the Club hasgiven  1000 for the establishment of a second Hostel in the town.          The las t to be opened is at Birmingham and theceremony was performed in the presence of a number of distinguishedcitizens of Birmingham by the Minister of Pensions on Saturday  jOctober 15th.          This latter makes the 10th Hostel that has been openedfully furnished and equipped with accommodation for a total ofabout 350 men.          The facilities which are afforded the men are thatthey are provided with accommodation and attendance free alsoa contribution of 3/- per week is made towards the mens Mess                                                      Account.
Account.          The Men form from amongst themselves a MessCommittee, set out what they require for  the week,  thepurchases are made hy the Matron and the food is cookedand served by the Staff.  Thus the men not only get apadequate quantity of food but they also obtain what theywish.          As few rules as possible are laid down, the desirebeing that the men should cultivate self control and thatthe Hostel should be a reflection of real home life, as faras possible, and a note Is given to each guest on enteringthe Hsstel setting out his personal responsibility for itsbeing properly conducted.          A Local Committee of Control is formed or beingformed for each Hostel consisting of 3 members of theEccentric Club and 2 members of the Local &apos;.&quot;ar PensionsCommittee.  This Committee has nc financial liability, allsuch being borne by the Eccentric Club Central HostelControl Committee.          Many members have made interesting personaldonations to the Hostels such as Trucks of Coal, sides ofBacon, cases of Tea5 full equipment of Cutlery, Bedding,etc. etc.          It is intended to open by the Club Members of thevarious districts similar Hostels in Blackpool, Leicester,Nottingham etc., but  1000 has to be guaranteed by thedistrict members as; as to ensure the continuance of theHostels.          The Treasures? has on deposit  7500 after paymentof all expenses of equipping and furnishing the 10 Hostelsand it is calculated this is sufficient for maintenancefor 3 years and as subscriptions are continuously beingreceived the financial condition is quite sound.  No onewho is not a member of the Club is permitted to subscribe                                                    and
and the sole object of the members in making the provisionof these Hostels is to afford every faeility to the LocalWar Pensions Committees of the district in &quot;fchleh the Hostelsare situated for ensuring that the men under Training arewell housed, well fed and well cared for,  and to give everyencouragement to the men to take up such a course of Trainingas will enable them to fill useful spheres in the industriallife of the Nation.
r         APPENDIX   XVi                 165ORGANIZAT ION  BRANCH.Extracts from Reports of Inspectors for     week ended 24th Ootober, 1917SHIPLEY LOCAL COMMITTEE,        The administration of this Committee is decidedlyimproving and much more care is taken before a grant is sanctioned.The Inspector went through a number of new cases and found themall in order.  The Committee have  made an effort to  recover alloutstanding advances with considerable success, and  the balanceoutstanding as frreooverable on June 31st, namely,  69. 6, 8 hasbeen repaid from looal funds.        Allowances for treatment are now the prinoipal expendi-ture.        The Aooounts are clear and kept up to date.        The Inspector reports that many Committees are raisingthe question as to what is to be done with the wife  and childrenof a man given institutional treatment in a non-attributable casewith a pension under 5/6.  Where a man receives a gratuity thereis no difficulty, but in the other oases the wives and childrenare not provided for.SOMERSET LOOAL COMMITTEE.        The work of this  Committee  has  suffered  in the past  fromthe fact that the offices and the officials were scattered andthere was no oentral control.  A new Secretary has been appointedand is getting things into order.   Difficulties  in obtaining asufficient staff have delayed the work  of re-organization.   In theopinion of the Inspector  it will now be well  done,  althoughprobably additional clerks will  be  required.  The Irlspeotorattended one of the weekly meetings of  the Executive  Committee andfound the work was very carefully^done.GLOUCESTERSHIRE LOCAL COMMITTEE.        It is pointed out that  in counties  such  as  Gloucestershirewhere much inspection of the  District  Committees has to be doneby car, that Paragraph 1(e) of  the Ministry of Pensions&apos; CircularNo.15 works some hardship.        The Clerk in charge of  the county work visits the DistrictCommittees from time to time  and  goes  through their work andattends their meetings.        Complaint has been made as to  the inadequacy of the 14/-temporary allowance for disabled  sailors and soldiers pending theassessment of their pensions.
t4S.        It  is  thought  that  the  Civil  Liabilities Commissionersshould  oonsider whether  any help can  be given to childlesswives before  they are  sent  to  the War Pensions Local Committee.It is pointed  out that in many  of these cases the Local Committeecannot  help in certain matters  where  the Civil LiabilitiesCommissioners  eould give assistance.GLOUCESTER CITY LOCAL COMMITTEE.        The Regulations have been broken in very many instancesand the  Inspector had to disallow quite one half of the oasesthat he  went through.  The Committee has, however, undertaken tobring the  grants within the Regulations and the work  will beagain shortly inspected.        The Committee makes a great point of giving grants underRegulation 13(a) to women for a short time after confinement forthe purpose of buying nourishing food.  This practioe requiresoareful  watching.        The Committee is well organised and divided into 15districts  with a representative for each and a band of some 80voluntary  workers.  There are 3,300 cases on the books including652 disabled men.        Complaint is made of the inadequacy of the 14/- temporaryallowance  granted pending the award of pension, and complaintswere made  as to the great delay in the payment of pay and allowancesto men sent home pending discharge.        The books of aooounts are veil kept and are up to date.Outstanding advances amount to  84, 13. 3.HAMPSHIRE LOCAL COMMITTEE.        This County is divided up into too many sub-sections underthe old Societies (Soldiers&apos; and Sailors1 Families&apos; Association,and Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Help Society.)        The provisionfor discharged men wants serious consideration.        Infringements of the Regulations have been adjusted wherepossible, but case-papers have not always been kept.   The orgainza-tion and administration is not altogether satisfactory but thesematters are now having the attention of the Local Committee.Pensions appear to be in order.  There is considerable difficultywith regard to Separation Allowance in respect of men traasferredto the Labour Corps.Ringwood Sub-Committee.        The organization is fairly good but the Committee only meetwhen required.  A few cases of errors have been discovered andadjusted.Winchester Sub-Committee.        The organization on behalf of wives and dependants is goodbut errors have been  discovered in connection with cases  taken overfrom the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Families&apos; Association.   The necessaryadjustments, however, are being made.
          There is  a lack of knowledge of the Regulations and  Instructions in menrs cases and these have been assisted with  insufficient enquiry and some of the moneys granted will have  to be returned as irrecoverable.   The Inspector suggests that  there should be one Committee only for Winchester City instead  of two as at present, one working for wives and dependants and  the other for men.  Sastleigh Sub-Committee.          This Sub-Committee meets every week and deals with 40  to 50 cases.  The organization is good.  The aocounts were in  order.  South Stoneham Sub-Committee.          This Sub-Committee oonsists of 30 members who meet as  required.  There  has been no meeting since last December.  There are twelve  almoners who bring their cases to the Secretary.  The Regulations are not well understood.  There is need of a good  Secretary and the Committee should meet more often.  Hew  Forest East  Sub-Committee.          The work  here is done by a representative of the Soldiers&apos;  and Sailors&apos; Help Society who awaits enquiries from Winchester.  New Forest West Sub-Committee.          The Sub-Committee here still consider themselves represen-  tative of the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Help Society.          From the  oases inspected it would appear that the assist-  ance granted was  rather under than over the amount of the sums  that could be granted.  This Committee meets once a Quarter.  Christohuroh Sub-Committee.          The Regulations have been carefully studied and the work  is well done.  Andover Sub-Committee.          The Regulations appear to be well understood and efficient-  ly carried out,  Alresford Sub-Committee.          The work  here Is not satisfactory and only four cases  are being assisted.  Peterfield Sub-Committee.          Not satisfactory.  Farnborough Sub-Committee.t          Only three cases bein? assisted with a population of 12,000I  to 14,000.  This  Sub-Committee is most unsatisfactory -^nd no case-  Papers have been  filled in.9 r. i
  Ald^fflttot Sub-Committee.         This Sub-Committee meets  onoe  a week and there are  some  80 cases under assistance, but  the Sub-Committee is guided  more  by the Regulations of the Soldiers1  and  Sailors1 Families1  Association than those of the Statutory Committee.   A revision of  oases in this Sub-Committee&apos;s area was promised.i  DORSET LOCAL COMMITTEE.         The organization is  on the whole very good and the work  carried out with keenness.         Poole is anxious to  have  a Local Committee of its own and  a meeting is arranged for the 24V instant to discuss the question  with  the County Council.         -Complaint ,is made of the  inadequacy  of the 14/- allowance  l^endLixig^thjer dec-lelon of pensions  and -also as &quot;to the delay in the  payment &quot;of pensions.PLYMOUTH LOCAL COMMITTEE.        The organization and administration of this Committeeseemed to the Inspector to require overhauling.  The officerequires re-organising and it is a question whether it should notbe moved to a more central position owing to the curious geographi-oal situation of the three towns which form Plymouth.        Complaint is made  as to the delay in the payment of Armypay and ration allowances  in cases of men sent home pending dis-oharge.  It is stated that many applications are made to the LocalCommittee regarding these.        Complaints are also made as to the delay in the paymentof temporary allowances and as to the delay in assessment andpayment of pensions for widows and dependants.LEITRIM LOCAL COMMITTEE.        This Committee only took up duty on the 1st June.  Therewere no payments or transactions durine: that month.  There is norent for the offices, only a charge of 2/6 a week for cleaning,but a Secretary has been appointed at a salary of  3 a month. &apos;ABERMRE LOCAL COMMITTEE.        The situation at Aberdare is.not altogether satisfactory.The Secretary has, however, promised to do his best to re-organisethis Local Committee in the shortest possible time and theInspector will pay a further visit in&apos; a month, by whioh time thereformation is to be expected.MIDLOTHIAN LOCAL COMMITTEE.        The auditor in his report on this Local Committee statesthat the Abstracts and Accounts as set out are correctly statedand sufficiently vouched for except that he had difficulties insatisfying himself that grants  made conform to the Regulations andthat payments are charged to the proper headings in the accounts.The difficulties pointed out have, however, been remedied in theperiod under audit.
