General Cadorna met General Foch.Among other points discussed was the capacity of the  -Italian Armies to resist attack.  Cadoma said thatin the event of Russia failing, and of his having toadopt a defensive attitude, if he could get the fieldbatteries sufficient to make up his force to 91 div-isions. for which he had the requisite infantry, hewas prepared to meot 110 to 120 Austrian Divisions&quot;.There was no question as to man-power, indeed he waswilling to accept the principle that Italy could sendinfantry to France in exchange for field guns. Neitherthe French nor ourselves were In a position to sendany field artillery, and the discussions betweenGeneral Cadoma and the French and British GeneralStaffs from this time until the renunciation of theItalian offensive on the 20th September, were ccn-cerned with the possibility and dates of despatch ofheavy artillery.On the 23rd September Cadorna gave as his reason foradhering to his decision to remain on the defensivethat further Austrian reinforcements had arrived, butexpressed no anxiety as to his ability to  receive anattack.   He considered the best policy to be to do s*and to counter attack heavily.General Cadorna In a letter of the 21st Septemberamplifying his reasons for abandoning the offensive,while saying that the artillery at present available wass There are now certainly 43 Austrian and 5 Germandivisions on the Italian front and thero may possiblybe 2 more Austrian and 2 more German.not

He       asked for no other assistance to enable him  to  do this.,R. 432. On the 21st October General Delme Radcliffe  reported that attack,,10.17. was expected from the direction of Tolmino;  that moral of       Italian Army was excellent and officers and  men were fully       confident of frustrating the enemy&apos;s offensive.&apos;R,4S7.  On 24th October a telegram was. received from General Delme.10.17. Radcliffe that all Italian Army and Corps Commanders had       reported that their troops looked forward with  complete       confidence to any enemy attack.  Opinion was expressed that       presence cf German troops would have opposite effect to that       counted upon by enemy and would unite  Italians  in their       determination to carry war to a victorious conclusion.  On       October 24th General Cadorna issued a  communique  to  the above       effect.R.489,  At 10-30 a.m. on the 25th October a telegraphic summary of a.10.17. memorandum by General cadorna was received.  This memorandum       stated that enemy main attack was being developed from direction       cf Tolmino.  He deplored the withdrawal of the  allied heavy       artillery but stated that he awaited development of  events with       complete confidence and perfect serenity;R.492.  On October 26th a.report was received from General Delme5.10,17,Radcliffe that General Cadorna had told him the situation was       serious;  that his troops had in some cases abandoned positions       and that he attributed this to intrigues in the country.On

     s   c B s  t  .     MovePgat of  Enemy Reinforcements  to, the  Italian Front.lt       The first  indication  of the  movement  of German     divisions  from  the  Russian to tho Italian  front was a     -vague report from Russian  agents  that  Germany intended  to     send 3  or  4  divisions  from the  Russian to  the Isonzo front.     This report, dated  the  5th September,  was  circulated by     the Bureau Central  Interallie/Paris,  &quot;under  reserve&quot;. It     was not until the 24th  September  that  a definite  report     was recoived that the  Alpine Corps was probably moving     from the Roumanian  to  the  Italian front.2.        The first  indication  of the  move  of German divisions     from the Western front  to  Italy was contained in  agents&apos;     reports, received 30th September, that German units had     moved through Strassburg  between 16th and 23rd September     for Italy.3.        The first  indication  of the  move  of Austro-Hungarian     divisions  from  the  Russian to tho Italian  front since the     termination  of  the  Italian offensive on the  19th  September     was contained in a  report  from Russia,  received 1st October,     that 2  divisions from  the  Eovel area might be moving to     Italy.   Betv/een the 19th  August, when the Italian offensive     commenced  and the 19th September  when  it ceased,  the Austrians     reinforced their Italian front  by %\ divisions from the     Russian front.4*       Definite information  regarding the execution  of any     of these movements  of  German units was not received until the     13th October when tho Alpine Corps was reportod to  have     reached the  Tyrol and  to have its H.Q.  in  the neighbourhood of     Brunook.   Its  presence on the  Italian front  was reported     by the  C.I.G.S. to  the  War Cabinet on  the  15th October.                                                         5.

The attached Summary &quot;A&quot; gives the movements of 5German divisions to the Italian front, only 2 of whichhavo heen identified by fighting and 1 by prisoners&apos;statements.   The C.I.G.S. reported to the War Cabinet onthe 23rd October that 3 Gorman divisions had been locatedon the Julian front.   On the 24th October information wasreceived that the Alpine Corps had been transferred fromBrunock. probably via the Pusterthal Railway to theneighbourhood of Tolmino, thus making 4 divisions locatedon the Julian front, increased on the 24th October to five bythe 117th Division whose presence thore was indicated byprlsonorsr statements.   It is possible that the 5th Divisionfrom Galicia may also have been moved to the Italian frontbefore the offensive began, but its location thero rests on areport, received lot October, that it was beirrj; equippedin Galicia for mountain warfare.     There is reason to beliove that the 6 divisions alreadymentionod may be in course of reinforcement by tho under-mentioned, viz:-11th Bavarian Division, still in line on Ypres front on26th October, but stated by prisoners captured on that dayto be destined for Italy.200th Division, still in line in St. Mihiol saliont butstated by prisoners to be destined for Italy as soon as ithas been made up to strength by drafts.7th Landwehr Division from Kovel sector.  Agentsr  reportsreceived 24th October indicate that the division,  which isa Wurtiemberg unit, may have been moved to the Trentino.This division has never yet been used for any offensive.
y t        The  attached Summary &quot;B&quot;  gives  the  movements of 2     Austro^Hungarian divisions from the  Russian to the Italian     front since the  19th September.   Neither of these divisions     has been  identified by fighting.8,        It is possible that  the  following Austrian reinforcements     may be destined  for the Italian front     26th Schutzen Division, from  Kovel area,  report received     11th October that division might  have  left for Italy on     3rd October.     27th Division, from Lemberg area,  report  received on 1st     October that division might havo  left  for Italy,  corrected     by a Russian report received  on 17th October that only     drafts had gone .9,         It is to be  noted that the Italian  Intelligence Department     estimated reinforcements  on Italian  front on 14th October  at                         3 to  4 Austrian  divisions                         ?  some German  divisions.
