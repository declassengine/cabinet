(1)31st Octeber, 1917.451Sir,          I beg to submit the following Report  on the  work of thePood Production Department for the week ended 30th Octeber       Conference with Chairmen of Executive Committees.          The onferencej attended by practically all  the  Ohairmenof Agricultural Executive Committees in England and Wales  and theDepartment^ District Commissioners, held in London *m the 24th,when you explained the seriousness of the food  situation owing tothe shortage of world supplies, and Lord Milner emphasised thevital importance of the work of the Committees  in endeavouring tosecure an increase in the home production of food,  will, it isanticipated have a very stimulating effect on the work of  theCommittees.   Prom several counties applications  have  alreadybeen received for copies of that part of your speech which  wasnot confidential and which might be circulated,  in order toenlighten Sub-Committees and farmers generally  as to the realfacts of the situation.                  LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION.Agricultural Executive Committees.Devon.  The Executive Committee have decided that in view ofthe ?;idely diverse areas in the county and its inadequate meansof communication, their work must be largely decentralised.   They,therefore, propose to set up four Divisional Committees to dealwith tractors, the administration of the horse scheme, with labour
exemptions,  with the survey of lands and with certain minor matters.The present  Executive Committee will remain responsible for thedischarge of the powers given by the Cultivation of Lands Orderand will act upon the recommendations of the Divisional Committeesjthey will act as a co-ordinating body and will regulate theallocation of supplies of tractors,  horses etc., to the fourdivisions.    Correspondence with this Department will continue tobe conducted by the Executive Committee.Lancashire.   The Committee have served a notice upon the HaydockPark Race Course Company for deep-ploughing of the land inside therails of the course^ and of certain other pieces of land in theiroccupation.Rutland.  The Executive Committee have been authorised to takepossession of 250 acres of Exton Park-,   The park has beeninspected by an officer of the Department in the company of membersof the Committee,, v/ho has reported that that area can be cultivatedwith a reasonable likelihood of obtaining good crops of oats,  andof recouping in two years the necessary outlay,  which will includea substantial sum for fencing.   The Committee propose undertakingthe cultivation themselves, and they have been recommended to  putin force the Rabbits Order, as the land cannot be cultivated untilthe rabbits  have been destroyed.Staffordshire.   The Committee have been authorised to takepossession of a neglected farm of 26 acres at  Shareshill whichthey propose to let.Suffolk, West.  The Committee have been authorised to takepossession of a farm of 50 acres, the tenancy  of which had alreadybeen determined by authority of the  Board,  and which had been  putup for sale  with vacant possession at kichaelmas,  but withoutfinding a purchaser.   The Committee propose cultivating this  landthemselves,  together with an adjoining farm of vrtiich they arealready in possession.
Drainage of Lan,ds.  .  In Lancashire meetings have been held by theChairman of the Executive Committee of those interested in thelands adjoining the Sankey Brook and the Glaze Brook, channels ofsome importance draining into the Mersey near Warrington. The resultof these meetings has been that in regard to the Sankey Brook aspoil bank which impeded the flow of water is being cut back byvoluntary effort, and the tipping of spoil has been stopped; arelief cut is being cleaned out by the adjoining owners;  andapplication is to be made for the establishment of a Drainage Boardto maintain this channel in future.  At the meeting with regard tothe Glaze Brook, the adjoining owners agreed to clean the lengthsfronting their respective lands without compulsion; in case of anyfailure to carry out this undertaking compulsory notices will beserved.          In Norfolk and East Suffolk a considerable improvement isbeing effected in the River Waveney (the county boundary! above thetidal limit at Shipmeadow Lock;  the work is being done by prisonersof war, and though  progress with hand tools is  necessarily slow,70 - prisoners have  completely cleared nearly five miles of the mainchannel in the last eight weeks;  another batch of 40 prisoners isnow at work upon subsidiary channels.  The work done will effect aconsiderable improvement in the valley lands and will, apart fromthe benefit done to arable land, provide increased pasture for stocktaken off grass land which is now to be ploughed up.          In the West Riding; of Yorkshire the Committee have forseveral months past been engaged in cleansing various channels Eastand South of Doncaster, and a report has been received this weekas to the work done in Tickhill Parish, which it is hoped to completein about a month&apos;s  time;  the cost will be recouped under thepowers of an Enclosure Award as regards public drains, and asregards private drains it will be collected from the occupiers.
The River Terne forms the boundary between the West Riding andNottinghamshire at this point and the owners on the Nottinghamshireside have voluntarily agreed to bear half the cost of cleaning outthe channels.  It is anticipated that land which formerly producedlarge quantities of cereals, and had latterly produced nothingowing to the want of drainage, will no** be ploughed up for the1918 harvest.  This improvement will have cost less than 2s. 6d.an acre.Damage by Game,  Action under the Pheasants and Rabbits Order isreported from East Sussex and under the Rabbits Order fromGloucestershire.Determination of Tenancies.  During the week 9 Orders have beenmade authorising landlords to determine tenancies on account of badfarming in respect of 477 acres, and 2 Orders have been made by theBeard determining the tenancies of 265 acres.Provision of Land for Allotments.  Nc reports have been receivedthis week with regard to the provision of plots under the Order,                      HORTICULTURAL DIVISION.Winter Courses of Instruction in Horticulture and Allied SubjectsrWith the object of increasing the production of food and securingits preservation, arrangements have been made for giving systematicCourses of Instruction to Allotment Societies and similar institutions.The courses of instruction will include:-     1.  Lectures given by a Staff of 20 Experts selected by the           Royal Horticultural Society.  The experts, who have held           a Conference and drawn up a syllabus, will each give           lectures In a given area of the country, and it is expected           that their direct advice in the management of land will           be found very useful to allotment holders and to small           cultivators.     2.  Lectures on Potato Disease and the results of this. vear!s           spraying will be given by members of the staff of this           Department.     3.  Demonstrations in vegetable drying and other methods of           preserving fruit and vegetables suitable for householders.          Of these Demonstrations, 48 were given during the pastweek.
                                                               *2 0* JCanning;.- The small canning stations at Bridgwater and Cheltenham,opened with the object of demonstrating the usefulness of theHome Canners in fruit districts, are now.at work.Exhibition.- At the instance of Sir Arthur Yapp, an Exhibition ofCanning, Fruit Bottling, etc. was given at Grosvenor House duringthe week for the benefit of representatives of the Press.Drying Stations.  The installation of a Drier to serve as atraining centre at Nine Elms Brewery is approaching completion.The factory belonging to Messrs. Farrow, Ltd. at Selby, has beeninspected, and it is proposed to instal six drying units in thefactory.                     TECHNICAL DIVISION.Inspection of Land.1.   A visit was paid to Essex on October 26thand 27th for the purpose of conferring with members of the Executiveand District Committees on the progress of the 1918 programme, andinspecting crass land on which questions had arisen as to thedesirability of ploughing.  The position in the county is difficult.There is a large area of tillage land on the London clay which isexpensive to work and much of which is now in very bad condition.In the same district there is much grass land which must be brokenup if the County1s quota of the national task is to be carriedthrough.  The grass land is so heavy and the general character ofthe farming so poor that it is certain that many of the farmers, ifforced to plough their share, would be ruined in the event of thenext year or two being wet,  Where capital and enterprise areavailable, it would be in the national interests that the land inquestion should be broken up, for when well tilled, it grows goodcrops of corn.   Suggestions are being made to the ExecutiveCommittee for the treatment of this land.    It is certain that unlesssome of the powers ;f the Executive are delegated to certain of theDistrict Committees in Essex, very little  effective action can beexpected on the clay soils of the county.
     2.   A visit has been paid to a farm in Northamptonshirefor the purpose of advising the tenant as to treatment of hisland, which at present, although apparently well cultivated,does not give, by any means, a satisfactory return in corn.     3.   An inspection has been made of a piece of grass landnear Tilbury belonging to the Port of London Authority, andconcerning the utilisation of which there is a difference ofopinion between the Executive Committee and the owners. The -soil is alluvium and is carrying a useful mixed herbage ofgrasses and White Clover.  It has been used for the grazing ofhorses belonging to jobbers in the neighbouring town, but asthere is no shortage of accommodation land in the district, itis clear that the portion in question should be made tocontribute more usefully and directly to the national foodsupply.  An effort will be made to secure a tenant who willgrow potatoes next year, or to let it for allotments.  There isa large dump of London manure bordering one side of the fieldand it seems unlikely that any obstacle will be placed in theway of cultivators using this material on the land.Plant Diseases.  Visits have been paid to Norfolk and Suffolkin connection with ravages of Frit Fly and other pests.  Theservices of two more honorary correspondents have been secured.The experiments on soil insecticides which were to be under-taken by the Imperial College of Science, mentioned in thereport for week ending 10th October, have h/id to be temporarilyabandoned owing to Professor Lefroy&apos;s services having beenurgently requested by the Wheat Commission.   An attempt will bemade to provide a substitute to continue  the work,  as the  needfor an efficient soil insecticide is of pressing importance.                          LABOUR DIVISION.Soldier Labour.  Several of the Agricultural ExecutiveCommittees have reported during the week  that their demands  for
                                                              $ K 7labour are not being met at the Distribution Centres, no menbeing available.  The attention of the War Office has beencalled to these cases with a request that additional men,especially skilled ploughmen, should be.made available at theCentres immediately to meet the outstanding demands.          The weekly returns shew that 11,830 so-called&quot;skilled&quot; men have been attached to the Depots to date, and ofthese 10,344 are out on farms.  With regard to the unskilledmen, 12,930 are attached to the Depots, and of these 10,784 areon farm work.          Additional men, to the number of 139, have been sentout for training as Tractor Drivers and Ploughmen during theweek, making a total of 1,130 men supplied for such training todate.Horses.  Orders for the issue of 149 horses were sent outduring the week, making a total of 3^119 horses to date.Prisoners of War.  Three batches of prisoners were added to theexisting Camps during the week, bringing the total number of -prisoners employed from the. Agricultural Camps to 3,401.  Inaddition, 553 prisoners are employed in agriculture from theparent camps and 1,253 interned aliens have been released foremployment in farm work.  The total number of prisonersworking in agriculture is, therefore, 5,207.  Schemes now withthe War Office provide for the employment of a further 755 man.                            WOMENfS BRANCH.          The number of women accounted for this week as membersof the Land Army is 6,379.  In the following returns the numberslent to the Forage and Timber Supply Departments are shown:-In Instruction Centres................... . ,288On Farm Work ...........................  5,423Forage .................................    381Timber............ .....................    109Waiting for references to be placed   in training centres.................     39Waiting for employment in Depots .......     41Waiting in their own homes.............     98
        &apos;  The Organising Secretary in Warwickshire reports that theimmediate  result of the West Midlands Test Meeting has been a rushof applications from farmers for women, not merely as seasonalworkers, hut as permanent.hands.          During last summer a large number of women were employedby the Flax Growers Association in Somerset in connection withthe flax required in the manufacture of aeroplanes.   ThisAssociation has informed the Department that owing, it is said, tothe German occupation of Riga, 1,000 acres of flax are to be grownnext year  in Somerset and that several hundreds of women workerswill be required for the harvesting of this crop.                    MECHANICAL CULTIVATION DIVISION.          The following statement shews the present position withregard to  the supply of Motor Tractors     Up to and including October 20th............. 1,579     Consigning instructions given during week.....    39     On offer to counties.........................   102     Consigned to Scotland   92         &quot;      &quot; Ireland    70 ...................   162                                                    1,882          The work of the tractors has been seriously interferedwith by the weather during the past month, but the percentage ofland ploughed to the number of days in which it is possible to worksteadily increases.          A record (so far as the returns of the Department areconcerned) has been registered this week by one. of the tractorsin the Doncaster unit (a Mogul) which ploughed 40 acres in 6 daysof 10 hours each.          The system of checking supplies which has been put intooperation shewed that some petrol, paraffin and oil had been takenlast week from the stores accompanying a tractor in Cheshire bythe farmer on whose land the tractor was working.   The policetraced the missing stores and the farmer has been fined  20 in thelocal Police Court for theft.
                    SUPPLIES DIVISION.  t                  I,    . ...........    1Approved Agents.  During the past week 8 counties have beenvisited by Inspectors who have chiefly dealt with the questionsof Approved Agents, Seed Wheat and Lime.  There are now only 6counties outstanding which have not appointed Approved Agentsand lists are expected from two of these immediately.  In thecase of the other four counties it will probably be necessaryto extend the date for acceptance of Approved Agents toNovember 7th.          A general increase of interest in Supplies seemsnoticeable in most of the counties.  In a certain number,secretaries have been appointed to the Supplies Sub-Committeeswho deal direct with this Department, and in these counties thequestions of Supplies are being dealt with very thoroughly.          &quot;Weekly Notes&quot; are now issued to Inspectors everyFriday night in order that they may be thoroughly In touch withall that is going on in the Supplies Division and that they mayknow which are the chief points to which attention should bepaid in their interviews with Supplies Sub-Committees.Sulphate of Ammonia.  The question of using Nitre Cake in theplace of Sulphuric Acid in the manufacture of Sulphate ofAmmonia has again been raised by the Ministry of Munitions.Some unexpected difficulties have been encountered in theexperiments which have so far been conducted, but the shortageof Sulphuric Acid early in the New Year is likely to become soacute as to make it essential to utilise to the full allavailable supplies of nitre cake.  This will necessitate theproduction of a certain amount of Nitre Cake Sulphate of Ammonia.This type of Sulphate only contains 20% of ammonia as against24i% of the standard grade, and will consequently be sold at acorrespondingly reduced price.
Superphosphate.  Owing to the fact that the Ministry of Munitionscontrols the carriage charges paid by makers, the distributionof Superphosphate is managed by a small Committee, composed ofrepresentatives of the Ministry and of this Department.Considerable quantities of Superphosphate  are being put intostore in the south and south-western counties) and this Departmentis pressing the Ministry to do everything in its power tofacilitate rapid distribution.   It&apos;  s essential to move thisfertiliser from makers&apos;.works at the present time, in order toavoid, as far as possible, the risk of congestion on the railwaysnext year.Basic Slag.  A report has been received from the Ministry ofMunitions, setting out the steps taken to grind low grade slag.This Department, in conjunction with the Ministry, is negotiatingwith the British Portland Cement Company to grind slag at some or&quot;their disused cement works.   There is every prospect that it willbe possible to grind basic slag at the rate of 1,200 tons per weekat Cambridge, and it may also be possible to arrange for grindingto be done at centres in North, and South Wales.    Returns are beingobtained from makers showing the orders they have in hand and thecontracts made for forward delivery.Lime.  The supply of lime for Somerset and Devonshire could beincreased by about 400 tons per week,  if the services of a skilledlime burner could be obtained.   Representations on the subjecthave been made to the National Service Department and the matteris to be brought up before the National Service  Committee nextweek.   Firms who are in want of labour are being advised tomake applications to the  Prisoners of  Far Committee,  at theHome Office, with a view  to their obtaining the  services  ofinterned aliens.
          The grinding plant which has been installed by theDepartment. at Croydon is expected to begin work in about afortnight&apos;s  time.   The firm on whose premises the plant hasbeen installed have advertised the sale very freely, and aconsiderable, demand is anticipated.Binder Twine,   The arrangement with makers for the sale ofBinder Twine, has now been completed, and a notice has beenissued to farmers urging them to place their orders at once.Flue Dust.  Negotiations for the collection and distribution ofFlue Dust are proceeding satisfactorily.   In order that theflue dust may be placed at the dispoal of farmers in potatogrowing districts such as Cornwall and Lincolnshire, it isproposed that the osdars from approved agents should be sentto this Department, who will arrange that the requirements ofthe principal potato growing districts shall be met in advanceof less important areas,Seed Wheat.   The number of orders received during the past week hasincreased considerably, largely owing to the distribution by theDepartment of seed wheat order forms and the insertion ofadvertisements in certain papers.   The total sales now amount to1,927 quarters.   CoDies of the seed wheat order forms have beensupplied to each Agricultural Executive Committee with a coveringletter asking them to distribute the forms as widely as possible;copies have  also been sent to each of the Societies affiliatedto the Agricultural Organisation Society, and about 35,000 havebeen sent direct to individual farmers;  it is improbable,however, that the home demand will prove sufficient to clear theDepartments stocks.          The French Government are urgently asking for a supplyof seed wheat, and, therefore,  an offer of from 15,000 to 20,000quarters of  these selected varieties has been submitted to  themthrough the  Commission Internationale de Ravitaillement.
Seeds (other than Cereals).  The Testing of Seeds Order, 1917,has been forwarded to the Board of Agriculture for Scotland andthe Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction forIreland in the form unanimously approved by a Conference ofrepresentatives of all parties concerned, with a suggestionthat the Ministry of Food be asked to issue the Order as soonas possible.          After consultation with the War Trade Department it isproposed to modify the present system of Issuing licences forthe export of certain seeds, and, In place of consideringindividual licences, to arrange for firms to submit an applicationfor a general licence to cover a period of two months.Seed Potatoes.  Pending the settlement of the policy to beadopted in regard to the disposal of the 1917 crop, the issue ofthe Seed Potatoes Order has been deferred and transactions inseed potatoes are practically at a standstill.  The issue of theDepartments scheme for distribution is also held up pending theissue of the Order.          Arrangements are being made for the inspection of 250acres which have been offered in Scotland for the growth ofimmune varieties In 1913, the produce of which will be used fordistribution in 1919.  The purchase of immune varieties inEngland have now reached 3,225f tons.                           I am,                                Sir,                                    Your obedient Servant,                                             Director-General.The Rt,  Hon.  Rowland E.  Prothero,   President  of the Eoard  of Agriculture                       and Fisheries.
