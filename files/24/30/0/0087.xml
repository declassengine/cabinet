(This Docwiiutrtt   the Property fHis Britannic Majesty^ Government.)Operations.SECRET.From     General Delme-Radcliffe,  Italy.To : -C.I.G.S* tWar Office.Handed in 4,10 a.m. 2.11.17.Received 11 a.m, 2.11.17.538 cipher. November 1st.     To-day Cadorna told(?me)that he thought the situationis improving on the whole, but that it would be Impossibleto foretell for some time what might happen, as he. wasquite sure that the enemy, xvhen he did make his nextattack would do so with tremendous violence.     He said he had got the impression that the Britishand French authorities had no intention of sending morethan divisions promised and he said he would repeat againthat this force, compared with what he thought wasnecessary to save the situation, was a mere drop in thebucket.  He said unless he was supported more strongly,he foresaw that a disastrous defeat would ensue, that inthis case Italy would be forced to make peace with theenemy1s foot on her neck.   I pointed out to Cadorna thatyou and Foch both thought Italian army was still strongenough to give good account of itself, as there were aconsiderable number of intact divisions and that theBritish and French reinforcement could only be a supportto the Italian army, that the 3rd army had saved thebulk of its guns, that ammunition was forthcoming forthe guns, that all the artillery with the six Britishand French divisions was really quite considerable andbeing modern and of best type would compensate to agreat extent for the artillery lost, much of which was .of reduced efficiency and of old pattern-,     Cadorna although he was rather vigorous in hisexpression of opinion of insufficiency of reinforcements&apos;offered,  seemed on the whole to have recovered his spiritsand I think is much relieved at assurances he is receivingfrom all sides that spirit of country is sound,  and thatthere is universal determination now to go through withthe war.
