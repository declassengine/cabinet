(29th October, 1917.)     There  are  increasing  signs  in high quarters  in  Austria-Hungaryof anxiety  to conceal the  growing decomposition and  exhaustion  ofthe State.   And yet the gravity of the situation  is really pastconcealment: and thus while  on the one  side  an attempt  is beingmade to put a good  face upon things,  the bitter truth will beblurted out in  another direction.   Parliament itself has unanimously demanded the abandonment  of the political censorship, and it isbeing openly asserted on all sides that the  old system  of muzzlingwas probably more responsible than any  other factor  for the entryof Italy  and Roumania against the Dual  Monarchy and  for thequestion  of food supplies  getting so  hopelessly out  of  hand.    Sofar as the  material side of  the  situation  is concerned, it maysuffice to  quote a  single  fact which  is more significant than manyvolumes.    The  authorities  have  issued  a public  appeal  invitingthe population  to  bring  in  to  special bureaus  created for  thepurpose any clothing and underclothing  which they  are able tospare - with a  view to their being  re-sold  to  the  general  public.The reason of this is that  the supply of material  for clothinghas practically run short in Austria.   A doctor in the GeneralStaff issues in the papers  a long appeal to the  patriotism of thepublic, announcing in so many  words that the army  authoritiesare no longer able to provide  the troops with  adequate  suppliesof underclothing and therefore asking for secondhand underclothingas gifts.    There  is a very obvious connection between this fact
                              - 2  -and the alarming growth of tuberculosis  among  the  troops  at  the -front.    A highly confidential statement has recently  been  receivedsummarising conversations which took place  a fortnight  ago in  aneutral country With a fairly  well-known non-German  politician fromAustria.   This statement deserves special  attention as one  of themost  interesting documents obtained for  a long time  past.     U)  The Emperor Charles.   The informant confirms the  verygeneral view in well-informed  circles  regarding the  new sovereign^character.   The Emperor is affable, sympathetic and very simplein his habits, but though accessible and ready to  listen  to  everyview, completely ignorant of political matters,  even the  most  vitalinternal political questions of his own  country.   Eor  this  reasonhe does not care to have politicians close  to  his  person,  as theirpresence merely serves to emphasise his  own ignorance.    This  isthe main reason why two such experienced ex-Premiers as Baron  Beckand Herr von Koerber are completely out  of  favour.    He also dis-likes associating with old people, and this is one of the reasonswhy he removed  so many of his  great uncle*s advisors.     The  only three men who have real  influence over him  areCount Czernin, v/ho shares his  own  habit  of  swift and even hastydecision,  Count Berchthold, v/ho though an ex-Eoreign Minister  hasno grasp  of political affairs  andis above  all interested in sportand country life, and Prince Conrad Hohenlohe  (known in Austriaas &quot;The Red Prince&quot;) who was expected  to exercise  a  decisiveinfluence  but has proved a great disappointment and  is  now steadilyposing ground although his daughter is married to  the ArchdukeMaximilian.   The witty Viennese have  nicknamed the  Emperor  Karljer Piatzliche  (&quot;Charles the Sudden&quot;), while the more mordantCzechs know him very widely as &quot;Liquidator  of  the  Eirm  of Austria&quot;.
       Count Czernin and Peace.   On 15th June a  deputation  of Czech  deputies waited upon Czernin, in connection with  the  food  difficult-  ies which had led to grave rioting in the Moravian  industrial  centres, and emphasised the desperate internal  situation and the  absolute necessity for peace before winter if an  explosion was to  be averted.   The Foreign Minister assured them that  peace would  be secured, if only they could hold out three months  longer.   He  put it to them that the main difficulty in the  way  of peace  negotiations was1 England&apos;s steady opposition to all direct contact,  but added with emghasis that &quot;once seated at the  table  of  the  Peace Conference, we shall never leave it: so far as  we are  con-  ctrned, there is no question upon v/hich agreement could not  be  reached&quot;.   V/hen the deputies inquired how far  this applied  to  Germany also (the conversation took place during  the  Chancellor  crisis), Count Czernin assured them that the German Government was  &quot;reasonable and had nothing in common with Reventlow&quot;.       On the second occasion one ef the Czech deputies frankly  argued that Austria was being exploited by Germany, and that  she  would do well to make a separate peace: whereupon Count Czernin  replied:  &apos;If we attempted any such thing, the Germans would be in  Prague in a week.1   On this and almost every occasion, it appears,  Count Czernin loses no opportunity of urging the  various Slav  deputies not to put their trust in the Entente, maintaining  that  England in particular had abandoned all idea of breaking up Austria  and illustrating his contention by quotations from  the  speeches of  Mr. Lloyd George and other British statesmen and  by reference to  the silence of Mr. Asquith and others.   Early  in August,  for^  instance, Count Czernin warned Mr. Stanek, the  President of the  Czech Parliamentary Club, and other Czech deputies, that if they  ventured&apos;upon any active policy, they would be  annihilated, and that  they  were quite mistaken regarding the war-aims of  the Entente.       The result of these tactics has been to create a certain
uneasiness in the minds of the Austrian Slavs with regard to theattitude of Britain:  but it has not in any way affected theirnational programmes.    In Bohemia the Young Czechs (the party o*fDr. Kramarz) have coalesced with three smaller groups, includingthat of Professor Masaryk, whose policy is thus almost openlyadopted by the larger part of the Czech representatives.   TheAgrarians remained distinct, but are in complete agreement, whilethe Socialists have ejected&quot; their opportunist leader,  Mr. Smeral,for not being sufficiently radical.   Even Mr. Smeral himself atStockholm admitted to a representative of Professor Masaryk that99 per cent of the Czech population accepted the latter&apos;s programmeand trusted blindly to the success of the Entente.    Internal Difficulties.   The informant foresees the certaintyof famine in Austria.   The crops have been bad, quite apart fromlack of labour and horses, owing to the fact that there has beenno proper manuring for the last three years.   Famine would havebroken out in April but for the Roumanian crop, Austria&apos;s sharein which was 50,000 trucks.   At the end of September General Hoferwarned the Pood Control (Ernahrungsrat) that they must reckonwith a deficit of 6,000,000 hundredweights of wheat -  which meansthat after all possible restrictions in distribution there will bea gap of a month before next harvest.   In political circlesHofer&apos;s calculations are regarded as much too optimistic, and thisapplies also to the figures regarding coal distribution supplied tothe deputies.     In view of the desperate situation the authorities areadopting more and more the method so successfully applied in Germanyof dividing the population into two.distinct groups -  the soldiersand reserved workmen, who are relatively well supplied and thecivilians, who are left in a deplorable condition, and thus fallinto% sort of physical and moral lethargy&quot;.    Desperate effortsare being made to improve the condition of the wounded men among  -V.^^&quot;^^-S:^^^?^:&apos;&apos;&quot;^^y3S; :Z/ZMMZr;.Z LC&quot;^:?:v:v;V-^                        &quot;
     In  the  internal -political  situation  of Austria there aretwo new  facts  of very  considerable  importance - the disintegrationof the German  parties  and the consolidation of the Czechs.     The Pan-Germans,  or so-called  &quot;German radicals&quot;, have definite-ly withdrawn from  the  German National Union.   Their pretext is theintention  of the Government to  permit the holding of by-elections,which would  result in  the return  of the various Slav deputiesunseated for high  treason but set free under the Amnesty.   The                              -  5  -whom the mortality  had been  greatly  increasing.    The situation ofthe prisoners,  except those  employed for  field labour (fortunatelylarge numbers are required for this)  is appalling.    For instance,at Wegscheid in Lower Austria  there  was at  one time an average offorty deaths per day.     Finance.   The  informant alleges that  13 milliard crowns( 540,000,000)  of paper money  have been printed in Austria and thatthe gold and silver reserve  at present amounts to merely  15,000,000,while the  loans concluded in Germany for  the purpose of keepingup the exchange exceed  80,000,000.   There is thus great pessimismamong Austrian  financiers, and Herr  Gomperz,  a, prominent memberof the Rothschild group in Vienna, said to  the informant:- &quot;Englandhas won the war; Austria can only  save her  life at  the price ofher political independence.    Austria must  attain at the moment ofnegotiations a  foreign loan  to cover her  16 milliards of TreasuryBonds in exchange for political  concessions.    Without that  shecannot live.&quot;   Herr Meinl,  the  rich coffee merchant,  goes aboutsaying that Austria is lost  without  a foreign loan.     There already  exists a  plan for  confiscating 10 per cent  ofall private property, movable  and  immovable,  issuing mortgagedebentures (pfandbriefe) for the amount obtained and offering  themto England or America.
real motive however is the no longer veiled desire to renderparliamentary conditions impossible and so to produce a situationin which the authorities will again revert to what are called&quot;ex-lex&quot; conditions and will then have no alternative save toadopt the extreme German programme of a coup dfetat (as con-tenplatid by Sttfrgkh and even by Clam-Martinic).     The immediate result, of the Pan-German secession has beenthe resignation of Herr Dobernig from the presidency of the Germannational Union: and the whole press regards the  collapse of the Union as imminent.     Meanwhilej as already indicated, the Czechs are closing theirranks.   All their political parties, including  the Socialists,form a solid Parliamentary Club and accept the programme of .Czecho-Slovak unity and independence as proclaimed on the 30thMay last.   The German attempt to create dissensions betweenCzechs and Jugo-Slavs has completely failed and  the Jugo-Slavparties are also actively consolidating themselves.   The suddendeath of Monsignor Krek, the Slovene Clerical leader - an ardentJugo-Slav patriot who enjoyed a high reputation  even in anti-Slavcircles - is a serious loss, but does not affect  the essentialfact that Clericals and anti-Clericals among the  Slovenes havecombined in support of Jugo-Slav unity.   It is  highly significantthat the Bishop of Laibach and his higher clergy  have publiclyendorsed the same programme.   Meanwhile the Ruthenes, among whomthe issue is less complicated, also maintain their opposition tothe Government owing to its friendliness to the Poles.     As the Government could not hope to win over Czechs,  Jugo-Slavs or Ruthenes, it concentrated all its efforts upon the Poles,and has actually succeeded in inducing the Polish Club to votethe Budget, by various material concessions in Galicia.    Thisdoes not mean that the Poles have definitely abandoned the Slavbloc, hut merely that they have used the situation of the  moment
:to extract concessions for themselves.   Their attitude in the future remains quite uncertain.   $hey are playing the same opportunist role Which they have played for two generations past: &quot;but it is much more difficult than ever in the past to calculate their probable action under given circumstances, owing to the extremely complicated interplay of forces between the various groups which make up the Polish Club as a whole.     The Government has thus secUred its finanoial position in Parliament for another four months, but its position remains none the less distinctly uncertain.   It is hov/ever obvious that the Austro-German victories in Italy will elate the Germans and have a correspondingly depressing effect upon the Slav elements in the Reichsrat, who are likely to adopt a policy of reserve for the present.     There ii&amp;fc been in Parliament a virtually unanimous demand for the abolition of the political censorship, to which the Government has. thought it wise to yield.   Public opinion in Austria may thus claim to have asserted its right to discuss once more many questions which were taboo for the first three years of war.   Undoubtedly the main contributory cause of this i3 the desperate economic conditions which prevail.   These con- ditions have been the subject of extremely frank and sometimes violent criticism in the Reichsrat, and most speakers have laid the blame upon Hungary and in particular upon the Agrarians of Hungary who have long pursued a policy of hoarding and exploitation of the food shortages of their neighbours.     The Parliamentary situation has been further complicated &quot;by a serious conflict between the Upper and Lower Houses in the matter of restoring the suspended Jury Courts.   The dispute is distinctly delicate as it turns upon two rival interpretations of
 he constitution, and in particular  of the much abused Paragraph 14,which provides under certain circumstances for  extra-Parliamentarygovernment.29/10/17.
