DQOUMT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRtTANNlC  MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT),R ET.W A R   C A B I N E T.                  MATERNITY AND WANT WELFARE.              Memorandum by the Minister of Reconstruction^ jl,    With reference  to the Memorandum (G.T, 2372) circulated by (the President  and Parliamentary Secretary of the Local Government [Board on this  subject,  my views on this matter were circulated to (the Cabinet in Memorandum G,T,  1268, and the subsequent development [of events, I am sure, has lent  support to the opinions therein Impressed.      I  believe that  this Bill  will be so contested in Parliament (that it  will not receive that unanimous support which is anticipated. 12.    In thS first place, it seeks to give^new powers to ill the [Rural District Councils j which  in Health matters are little other than [Poor Law Authorities, and to even the smallest Urban District Councils. [This Will bS exceedingly unpopular.  It will certainly raise the hostility of the Insurance Committees, who are, of course, concerned with maternity questions; and,  worst of all, I am quite sure that It will  commit us to  an inefficient system of Public Health Adminis- jtration,   I,am afraid that to expect that we shall get any effective IHealth service out of the 1,500 or so Local Authorities which may be I authorised to  act by  this Bill  is out of the question, and I am satisfied that the proper line  of development - and the only course to take  to get a successful Health system - is to entrust the duties to the larger  Authorities with  proper arrangements for co-operationiwlth the Insurance Committees.    I am afraid that if the BillI reached  the Statute Book, it would only add another to that large number of legislative wayfarers which fail to march. 3.    There is nothing  said in  the Memorandum with respect to medical  services, nor does there appear to be any scheme prepared; and without this, nothing effective will be accomplished. 4.    I  am sure that  the War Cabinet will acquit me of any desire whatever to be obstructive where the question of Maternity and Child Welfare  is concerned, and I feel much regret at having to make these criticisms on  the proposals of  my colleague, the President of the Local Government Board.    I repeat with added emphasis what I said before,  that attempts to get a properly directed Health Service until *e have  reached an agreement on the subject of the Central Authority WU1 prove futile and wasteful.(Sd.)C. ADDISON.31st October, 1917.
