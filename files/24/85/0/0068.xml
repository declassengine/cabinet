// /I II Oft WAJjOa/A- REQTJIRBMTS   IN   PERSONNEL. FOR   THEROYAL   AIR   FORCE.Minute by the Secretary of State for War &amp; Air.I circulate herewith two memoranda by the Under-Secretaryof State for Air, dealing with the further immediate requirements for the granting of a further 500 permanent and 1000 temporary commissions, and for the enlistment of an additional 15,000 men and 1000 boys.    I would ask that these papers may receive the 0abinet!s consideration at as early a date as possible, since the additional personnel is, for the reasons stated, most urgently required,1.3.1D. (int).   W.S.O.in personnel of the Royal Air Force.Sanction is requested
&amp; 0 0The Cabinet at a meeting held on May 8th (Wo: 564) authorised the grant of 2,500 temporary commissions in the Royal Air Force, of which 1500 wereto be for a period of four years and 1000 for a period of not longer than three years.-   The Cabinet had previously decided at a meeting held on April 14th (No:556) that permanent coitim lesions should be granted up to a maximum of 1500, making a total of 4,000 commissions, permanent and temporary for flying officers.A further examination of the requirements of the Royal Air Force renders&apos; it necessary to ask authority for 500 more   permanent commissions, and also 1,000 more temporary commissions.   The 500 permanent commissions are required to enable adequate provision to be made for staffing the Medical and Chaplains&apos; Branches, and for the Airship Department, (which thotirh at present administered by the Admiralty is manned entirely by Air Force Personnel), and also to make provision for officers to be loaned to the Department of Ciftil Aviation, and the Department of Supply and Research.The allotment of a mnxiwuiii further number of 1,000 temporary commissions will make the total number of temporary commissions 3,500.   This latter figure is in accordance with the number for which authority was originally asked in the Air Council Memorandum dated Mny&apos;6th on which provisional allot-ment of 2,500 was made by the Cabinet.I wish to make it clear than -an early decision is necessary to enable the Services referred to above to be organised and set going fend to provide for present requirements. If these numbers prove .to exceed the future requirements, tho position will be capable of easy adjustment by delaying the in-take of permanent or temporary officerB,, or both.51.7.13. (Int.) J.S.
The authority of the Cabinet is desired for the enlistment of a further 15,000 men and 1,000 boys for the Royal Air Force,   It is anticipated that the present limits of authority for recruiting will be quickly reached when the new rates of pay fftr N.C.0s. and men are promulgated.     These provide for a maximum number of 27,000 N.0,0s. and. men.   Of the 58,000 men at present in the Force, two-thirds are men whose services are limited to the Army of Occupation period,   V/hen this period comes to an end there will only be about 14,000 trained men left in addition to 8,000 untrained recruits, of whom 5,000 are boys.It is essential that we should secure a consider-able enlistment of skilled men for replacement of the men of the Army of Occupation,    The numbers now nsicod are the minimum required before the end of the current year,31.7.19. (Int.)   J.B.
