Jtfjljlgjy Secret. 1012/.&apos; From Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary oj State for hidia,25th July 1919.(Repeated Gonstantinople.) (Received 2.45 pan.)10027.   24th July.   Malleson wires dated 21st July :-&quot;Turcoman deputation. Leader is liaji Amnat, A ska bad. Government. They claim they are authorised to speak in name of all Turcomans, including Yamuts. They desire to have nothing further to do with Russians of any description but wish on principle of self-determination and (? group omitted) to be allowed to manage their own affairs under wing of British with (corrupt group). They ask whether Peace Conference cannot declare whole of (? Turcomans) from Caspian to Oxus proper Turcoman nation. They say in sueh case British prestige would suffice to keep all quiet. They would be willing to join free federation of Russian States hereafter but are sick of the lighting in their country and wish Russians of all kinds to leave them alone.&quot; (2) They say Persians, Kirghiz and Sarts who form Bolshevik army in Transcaspia have all stipulated that they are not to fight against British, and that Bolshevik leaders shall know, that their army in Transcaspia would melt away if British made any move. They say it would not be necessary for British actually to enter Transcaspia but that mere sending of British troops to Persian border opposite Kaakha or Dushak would suffice to make Bolsheviks immediately evacuate Askabad, thus saving Krasnovodsk.&quot; (3) They say that Turcoman, like all Mahomedans Central Asia, look on British as great and benevolent friend of their religion, and that in view of good relations established during last year all such would be reluctant to make or join any movement calculated directly or indirectly to injure us. But that if left unaided by Peace Conference now they and their co-religionists may forcibly be swept into the net of-Bolshevism with results which no one can foretell.&quot;(4) In reply I have&apos;promised to forward their views to higher (authority. I have pointed out that as we are at war with Afghanistan no troops can be spared to make demonstration towards Kaakha or Dushak, at any rate for the present time.&quot; (5) Personally, if matters with Afghanistan are patched up, I think Bolshevik fear of us is so great that a movement on the Transcaspia frontier would quite possibly make them go. This is of course always provided that Orenburg front is not opened.&quot;2. On 23rd July Malleson wires in continuation : &quot; Turcoman party left ready for frontier. They beg that it should be remembered that they represent 96 per cent, of whole population between the Caspian and Oxus and that due weight will be given to their prayer for self-determination. They say they will never forget kindness of British whose enemies are their enemies.&quot;
