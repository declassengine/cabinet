From Viceroy, &apos;SOth July 19.19. .-(deceived 31st, 11 a.m.)1105 S. Secret. Afghanistan. Following from Grant, dated 29th July :  &quot; Peace Conference met at 11.30 to-day. Ali Ahmad began with long rambling reply to my address probably written in anticipation by Muhammad Tarzi. He dealt with our tribal difficulties, circumstances and causes of this war, our delay in answering Ammulla&apos;s original letter, independence of Afghanistan, our failure to reward Afghan Government for their neutrality in great Avar, our disregard of their request to be represented at Paris Peace Conference, the Indian disturbances and Rowlatt Bill, the condition of Ireland and Egypt, general world forces affecting Afghan people, the sympathy of Afghanistan with. Turkey and our estrangement from the Moslem world, the dependence of the Amir on will of the Afghan people and other vague subjects.I replied rebutting a number of the tmcontested (corrupt group) and emphasising that there could be no question as to responsibility for present war. Indeed, Ali Ahmad admitted it would not have occurred if Habibulla had lived, though there would certainly have sooner or later been a resolution, (dc) against him. As regards the tribes, I said wherever there was a frontier there must be difficulties, and that a solution of these lay in the no-operation of the States concerned. I asked if his references to India, Ireland and [-Egypt were merely friendly advice or had any bearing on peace terms. Ali Ahmad said the)7 were merely friendly advice. I said I was obliged, but that we might now (? drop these) subjects finally. I. then turned to the question of the independence and said I presumed this referred to control of extern ah relations of Afghanistan and reviewed the treaty arrangements of the past, explaining they had been in. the nature of a partnership without any idea of subordination. The wise rulers of the past had delegated to us a task we could perform for them better, than they could themselves with our great diplomatic experience and our (? efficient) diplomatic agency. I urged the great mutual advantage accruing from this arrangement and the desirability of its continuance. Ali Ahmad, in reply, was perfectly definite that they would not continue the arrangement and must have complete independence, both externally and internally.&quot; I then turned to the Bolshevik menace with which they had tried to frighten us and said that idea of the Bolshevik and Afghan Governments amalgamating and working in harmony was laughable. Ali Ahmad admitted that Bolsheviks were coquetting with Afghan Government, but expressed horror of them and said it was our joint interest to unite and keep them out. I agreed, but said that this would be-only possible if we could conclude (?. &apos;with&apos; omitted) friendship on our terms. If this were impossible, we were not afraid. India was not a suitable soil for Bolshevism to thrive upon; we could trust to the good sense of India and should not, moreover, hesitate,&apos;if need be, to close all the passes into Afghanistan regardless of trade or nomads. This evidently impressed them. Both Shams Shah and Gurbaksh Singh (?.spoke) well in support of my contention that India was not afraid of (word omitted ? Bolshevism). i *&quot; The question of damage caused by aeroplanes to the grave of Amir Habibulla was mentioned with some bitterness. I expressed sincere regret of my Government that such an &quot;accident should have occurred and explained that it whs entirely unintentional.   The Afghans accepted this (? readily).&quot;As regards the rewards for past services to which Ali Ahmad recurred, I pointed out that Ave had been given no opportunity of sliOAving our gratitude and that Aveare scarcely-under obligation to present Amir whatever our obligations to his father.&quot;I asked Ali Ahmad to (? let me know) at next meeting Avhat they meant by their objects to which, lie constantly referred, and said&apos;I hoped Ave might then get to practical business of peace-making. He agreed. So far as we can judge, judging by (? to-day&apos;s) conversation, the following are my conclusions : &quot;(1) The Afghans will not, in any circumstances,, agree to old arrangement regarding their foreign relations.&quot; (2) They are anxious for a reAvard for past services-resumed money..&quot;(3) They may propose some astounding readjustment of the frontier so as to give them our more troublesome tribes. , . -
&quot; (4) They look to Bolsheviks to give them territorial concessions (? northwards of) Khushk, &amp;c.&quot;(5) Their desire for. sovereign independence is probably connected with a desire for -the Khalifate.&quot;(6) They are inclined to delay proceedings. I shall await statement of objects at the next meeting. If it is preposterous, I shall then present them with our trpaty as the most we are prepared to grant at&apos; present and give them a written statement of the conditions on which they can, if they Avish, earn our friendship later. I believe it will bring them to their senses,, if they are (? thus) cut adrift, and there is no real fear of their linking up seriously&apos;with the Bolsheviks, for whom they have no sympathy whatever. This programme commends itself in view of the possibility of serious frontier incidents if negotiations are prolonged.&quot;
