PHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOTOttttlENT).T. 7874. UAR CABINET,PROPOSED ROYAL COMMISSION ON THE UNIVERSITIES OFOXFORD AND (CAMBRIDGE.(Memorandum by Mr. H.A.L. Fisher),The ^purpose of this Memorandum is to ask the Cabinet forits formal approval for the setting up of a Royal Commissionto inquire into the finance and government of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge.An Inquiry into the finance of these Universities has been rendered necessary by their application to the State for Grants of very considerable sums.   Hitherto the State Grants received by Oxford and Cambridge have been confined to comparatively small sums received from the Board of Education in respect of the training of teachers and of Tutorial Classes (in connection with the Workers1 Educational Association) and Grants for Agriculture and Forestry from the Board of Agriculture.   The Department of Engineering at Oxford also recently received a small grant of between  200 and  300, and the Medical School at Cambridge about  6,000.   Both of these, grants have been paid by.the Board to the Departments of Engineering and Medicine, respectively, on a per capita basis under Kfe^regulations which have now been withdrawn in consequence of tne pooling of the money available for grants to Universities in the Estimates for 1919, and the decision in future,.to pay single inclusive grants to Universities.   So long as(to) the two Ancient Universities were able to subsist upon their Endowments and Students1 fees without coming to the State for any considerable subsidy, there was no obvious reason, failing evidence of sub-stantial educational shortcomings, for a Government Inquiry at this moment into their financial resources.The situation of the two older Universities, has, however, been greatly affected by the higher cost of living (necessitating an increase in salaries and wages), and the Increased cost of essential material and equipment, especially in the sphere of Natural Science consequent upon the T7ar*  And now that the two Universities are applying to the Government, not only for large Capital Grants but for Maintenance Grants of at least  20,000 a year, the need for an Inquiry becomes obvious.   Before Parlia-ment can be asked to vote such sums as these to Institutions which are popularly believed to be wealthy, it must be satisfied that the Universities are making the best use of their existing resources and that those resources, carefully husbanded and scientifically developed, are insufficient to meet all legiti-mate needs without augmentation from the public purse.   I think also that Parliament is entitled to have the same kind of assur-ance with respect to the Ancient Universities, which it has long possessed in connedtion with those Universities which are in receipt of Treasury Grants, i.e. that they are reasonably access!-ble to poor students and that their frame-work of Government is compatible with efficient administration.An Inquiry into the financial condition of Oxford and Cambridge most include an investigatiOmof the financial condi-tion of the Colleges.&quot;  Parliament-must be satisfied that the Colleges are making adequate contributions to University purposes and that they are malting the best and most economical use of their Endowments.   Indeed&apos;the&apos; existence of these practically autonomous Bodies and their relation to the
fhiverMty constitute perhaps the most important, aspect of University finance and government.   The Oxford Colleges have already stated their willingness to co-operate and there Js no suggestion that the Cambridge Colleges will refuse to assist the Commission in its Inquiry,It is contemplated that the ncope of the Inquiry should he limited to finance, interpreted to include questions of University and College government and organisation hearing on the financial position.   It will he necessary to consider the University&apos;s system of government, the relation of its executive officers to its governing bodies, and the relation of those bodies to each other. Ah inquiry into College finance would imply consideration, among other questions, of the system of Fellowships   and Scholarships,, the cost of tuition and living, and the application of College funds to buildings.    Tho Commission would also naturally be led to consider the relation of the University to the Colleges, both in the financial aspect, with reference to College contributions for University purpoees, and in the educational functions of tutors and professors.The complexity of both Universities, their individual characteristics, and their value to the intellectual wellbeing of ihe Nation suggests that the Commission appointed to deal with their finance and government should be so constituted as to ensure a sympathetic understanding of their spirit and conditions.   It is desirable that the Commission should include a sufficient number of members who aro familiar with Oxford and Cambridge and that it Should also include members specially qualified to deal with tho financial and administrative questions which arise in academic societies.   It is also desirable that Labour should be represented upon the Commission, and it would be in accordance with the spirit of the times if one of the Commissioners, at least, were a woman. Agricultural exports would naturally find a place in a Body, one of whose functions would be to report upon the management of the College Estates.With a view to greater expedition I suggest that the Commis-sion should be divided into three sections - an Oxford Section, a Cambridge Section, and an Agricultural Section.   The Inquiries into the finanoe and organisation Of Oxford and Cambridge would be conducted concurrently and separate reports would be drawn up for each University.   It would, however, be desirable that all tbxoe Sections before finally coming to a conclusion upon their recom-mendations should hold joint meetings with a view to. a comparison of impressions and to the submission of common proposals as to the constitutional reforms needed by the two Universities   seeing that they have many features in common.   The function of the Agricultural Section would be to report upon the management of the College  states and to submit suggestions as to the methods by which the College revenues might be augmented.The readiness of the Universities to co-operate in the proposed Inquiries makes it unnecessary to consider the appointment of a Statutory Commission.   Whether a Statutory Commission may be desirable to give effect to the recommendations of the Royal Commission is a matter that must wait until such recommendatione, if any, have &quot;been received.I suggest that the reference to the Royal Commission might run as follows:-MTo inquire into the amounts, character, administration and application of the financial resources of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge and of the Colleges and Halls therein and in that respect to consider the Government   of their Universities and their relations to their constituent Colleges, and to make recommendations&quot;.22nd July 1919.(Sgd) H.A.L. FISHER.
