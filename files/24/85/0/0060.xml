CHURCHILL.1st August, 1919.(1.) Letter prom Major-General Holman.British Military Mission,Ekaterinodar,Dear Mr. Churchill, 8th July, 1919.1. On taking over here from General Briggs on 12th June, i discovered that the situation was changing with bewildering rapidity, and that the Mission was confronted with new problems and new conditions.2. With everyone working at high pressure, it was difficult to get a coherent idea of the events which led up to the present situation, but I think the following brief account, based on the knowledge of the best informed officers, to be accurate.3. When General Briggs arrived, General DenikhVs fortunes were at their lowest ebb. The Cossacks of the northern districts of the Don had never experienced the horrors of Bolshevik tyranny and only knew the Bolsheviks when the latter were retreating before Krasnov&apos;s forces, aided by the Germans. The Bolsheviks were not a .f* terror at that time. On the contrary, they left behind them much loot taken from the &quot;burjuis&quot; and Jews of Eostov, and many stories of the great times they had had harrying the town dwellers.4. When the German protection of the, left flank of the Don was withdrawn and Krasnov&apos;s promises of Allied help remained unfulfilled, the Northern Cossacks, never as trustworthy as the men of the southern districts, left the front. Most of the Don and Donetz Basin were then swamped by the Bolsheviks, who very nearly cut off Eostov and Novocherkask, the capital of the Don, from the Yolunteer Army.5. The first impetus of Trotzki&apos;s armies carried them forward with some elan.6. Denikins only successes, namely, those.at Stavropol and in the Northern Caucasus, could not be exploited by him, because he had to throw his most trustworthy troops into the Donetz Basin, the denial of which, to the Bolsheviks was a matter of vital importance, owing to the essential fuel supplies which ^ they were able to draw therefrom.*   7. The military situation was very bad, but Denikin had to face other difficulties of a worse nature.8. The russians will never forgive the French for what they did in the Ukraina and in the Crimea, and our handling of the Trans-Caucasian question alarmed them almost to an equal degree.9. The more pessimistic actually discussed seriously the question of asking us to(B19,&apos;35d)   80  8/19  KiS  7360wo
evacuate their women and children so that they might be free to attempt to cut their -way- through to Kolchak.10. Denikin could not see any prospect of raising enough troops to need,.all the arms and equipment we had promised, and said he would be content with supplies for, 100,000 men. .11. We may fairly claim that it was British assistance which caused the tide to turn and flow so fast in the right direction, and I am sure the Russians are most grateful, because, although that help took a long time coming, its effect was magical. m 12. The revival of morale in the ragged, typhus-ridden, verminous regiments, caused by good uniforms, boots and machine guns, but most of all by the realization by them of the fact that we were really behind them, was wonderful.13. The Donetz Basin was held Tor three months by 4,000 bayonets, mostly officers, against 40,000 Bolsheviks, who were expecting to be reinforced by fresh divisions marching.to join them. (14. The first reinforcement for the Volunteers consisted of the &quot;Iron Brigade&quot; from Odessa, 40 per cent, officers, and one cavalry regiment. Their hatred of the French was great. . (jlothed entirely in British uniforms, with British equipment fitted on them by British officers, they clipped their moustaches, tried to salute in the British way, and were known as&quot; Our new Englishmen.&quot;15. The counter offensive was led by British tanks. After three fights it was found to be unnecessary even to detrain them ; the Bolsheviks did not wait to be attacked. Kharkov was occupied almost without loss, and the &quot; Volunteer Army,&quot; as Mai Maevski&apos;s Corps was now called, which had never more than 12,000 bayonets and sabres in the fighting line, drove 80,000 Bolsheviks before them like sheep. Trotzki came down with his propaganda train, made speeches, distributed proclamations, and executed waverers, but could not stem the tide. The mobilized peasants of the Red Army refused to fight. Not only would they not face tanks but the spell was broken. They knew we were behind Denikin and so believed that the Soviet was doomed.16. This bears out what officers who knew the Russians always said, namely, that, as soon as we declared ourselves definitely on the side of the anti-Bolsheviks and proved it by the provision of British material and technical assistance, the Red Army, which is in the main composed of men forced to fight against their will, would lose heart.17. The only real resistance the Bolsheviks have offered has been at Tsaritsin. Here, too, British tanks and low flying aeroplanes turned the scale. The timely and wholehearted support given to Denikin by Rear-Admiral Culme Seymour has enabled him to clear the Crimea, whilst the brilliant operations of Commodore Norris in the Caspian Sea have given him a much needed sense of security as regards his right dank and rear.18. So much for our material assistance and its effect on the morale of the Volunteer and Bolshevik forces.19. There was another factor without which our assistance could not have had its full effect General Briggs came at a time, when Denikin&apos;s fortunes looked black, when there was much hatred of the Allies, and when the weaker spirits, the ultra-monarchists and the Jews, were all talking of an alliance with the Germans. The Russians are very susceptible and quick to appreciate character. They soon began to look on General Briggs as the best example of the best type of Englishman strong, straight and with that stern sense of duty which they themselves lack, a sportsman and a gallant soldier, and, rather to their surprise, a man with sympathy for, and a comprehension of, their difficulties. In fact there sprang up amongst them a regular &quot; Briggs&apos; legend.&quot; He is a difficult man to follow, and had he remained here I would have been proud to serve under him.20. General Denikin was, I believe, apprehensive that the departure of General Briggs and his replacement by an officer of lower rank might indicate a change of policy on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government and that the Mission was regarded by them as having lost some of its importance, but I have striven to correct any such impression and I hope it will disappear altogether in time.21. If Kolchak&apos;s Army is staunch (I have no definite information about its present state) a set-back may be avoided, provided that Denikin is able to cope with the administrative and economic problems which face him. His task is to set going the life of the re-occupied country with as little interference as possible, preferably through the Zemstvos, and with the minimum bureaucratic machinery put it in the way of the people to feed and clothe themselves. The irreconcilable communists are few in number and are mostly demagogues and not fighters.
22. I am convinced that it is only by prompt and efficient aid in the direction of feeding and clothing the destitute people in rear of DenikhVs righting troops that we can help to stamp out the Soviet before the winter. A winter of hardship would make the task supremely difficult and might produce another wave of an even more desperate kind of Bolshevism. We can clothe Denikin&apos;s Army for the winter if his requests are complied with at once, but His Majesty&apos;s Government must do more than this. They must show the victims of Bolshevism that their only chance is to enter into normal relations with the outside world.23. The first step needed is assistance to the Russians in the reorganization of their railways and the allotments of ships to bring out clothing, clothing material, blankets, thread, boots and agricultural machinery-. It is necessary that His Majestys Government should make a statement showing that they appreciate the dreadful state to which Central Russia has been reduced by the Soviet and that they are prepared to help. The peasant will not part with his grain for worthless paper money, but he will barter it for the things he required. Grain is a matter of life or- death for the people in the towns. Grain for them, must, therefore, be obtained by bartering for it the things the peasants need.24. At the same time, it is imperative that the railway employees be kept content and efficient, because, without the railways the whole of the towns will starve, even if grain can be obtained from the peasants. The clothing, blankets and boots must, therefore, go, in the first instance, to the railway workmen, until their needs are satisfied, and the surplus can then go to the ordinary civilian population. The material for the railway employees can be handled, by the railway companies, but the remaining articles should be handed over to the co-operatives for distribution to the people. We might undertake to receive payment in sterling, when the exchange is stabilized, or in raw material, to be provided by the co-operatives. The co-operatives must, of course, be backed by Denikin&apos;s Council, on behalf of the future Government of Russia.25. A really big economic expert with wide powers must, of course, come out immediately to supervize the whole transaction, but the great thing is to give the undertaking at once,, to spread the information by aeroplane in all big towns, and to redeem our promise by prompt action. We may have Kursk shortly and then we can drop messages over Moscow. The Bolshevik&apos;s campaign has been largely one of propaganda; we now have the opportunity of beating them at their own game.26. In spite of the present favourable turn taken by the military operation, I am convinced that we should not slacken our efforts to provide naval and military assistance, and I fully endorse General Brigg&apos;s request for clothing for 500,000. This clothing, and probably a great deal more, will be needed before the winter.27. Rapidity of supply is essential; we have hitherto suffered greatly from delay.28. Machine and Lewis guns are also necessary.29. Tanks, armoured cars and guns on naval mountings for armoured trains, and for recaptured craft on the volga, are badly needed.30. Saddles are also badly needed ; in the recently occupied areas there are horses and men who can ride them, and, if we only had the saddles, the art of raiding and flank turning, which has been developed by both Cossack and regular cavalry, could be employed on a more extensive scale and would save, many casualties.31. Denikin appears to me to be a strong and honest man who does not swerve from his purpose, the re-creation of a great united Russia. He speaks fearlessly on all occasions against those who allow their petty ambitions to deflect them from the path of true patriotism. He has an extraordinarily difficult part to play, but he plays it with a calm determination which commands respect. Unfortunately, there are a great many Russians who put their own petty ambitions and interests before the welfare of their country, and the craze for so-called independence of certain interested self-seeking parties and individuals in the Kuban and other parts of the country makes the problem of the restoration of normal economic conditions extraordinarily difficult. Thus, the Kuban has a superfluity of grain but will not allow it to be exported to the Donetz Basin where it is urgently needed to prevent famine.32. The encouragement by the Allies of the separatist tendencies of parts of Russia, such as Finland. Georgia, &amp;c, which they regard as integral parts of their country, fills with consternation those truly patriotic Russians who maintain that this is playing Germany&apos;s game, which is to render Russia harmless by splitting her up and then to command her markets by supplying the. different powerless divisions of the country with all they need. Denikin has asked me to point&apos; out that he fears Russia will be nothing more than a market for many years to come, but he-hopes that we shall command the market and not the Germans, because he believes that we will deal squarely with Russia and not set out to ruin her.(7360)
33. I thank you most sincerely for sending me here. The task is a difficult one, hut I face it with whole-hearted enthusiasm, and shall put into it every ounce of energy i possess. With your support and the personal assistance you promised me, I am sure the Mission can, and will, make good.34. In order that our needs may be met and that our task may be made possible, I should mo*st earnestly request that a committee be formed in London to co-ordinate all questions concerning this Mission. This Committee should, I submit, have on it a representative from each of the Departments of State and branches of the Staff concerned, Admiralty, War Office, Foreign Office, Board of Trade, Treasury, G-eneral Staff, A and Q Staff, &amp;c, to ensure coordination of effort and the issue to me of orders and instructions which will not be conflicting.35. The feelings of General Denikin can be imagined when he is confronted with constant changes of policy and procedure, which all tend to make him wonder whether the Mission is withholding from him facts and information which he should be told, The prospect of the withdrawal of the British on the Caspian Sea and in the Caucasus and their replacement by Italians, who do not command any respect in Russia, is viewed with consternation by him, by all patriotic Russians, and by the commercial community. If carried out, it is impossible to say what will happen, but it is not unlikely that chaos and disorder will arise in the whole of Trans-Caucasia, and that Denikin may find his rear and right flank compromised.q 36. Please forgive me for writing to you at such length, but I cannot forget your words to me just before I came out. You then said that you considered this Mission to be one of the greatest importance, and instructed me to write to you direct. I have been busy settling down into my work and studying the whole problem, and am onlyT now in a position to express an opinion based on the opinions and knowledge of the best informed officers out here, and to make recommendations which I believe, after careful consideration, to be sound.Believe me,Sincerely yours,H. C. HOLMAN.(2.) Note by the General Staff on the mo vision op a Credit ofTWO MILLIONS in THE UNITED KlNGDOM FOR general DENIKIN.1. The question of economic assistance to Denikin divides itself into two parts : (i.) The military necessity of placing General Denikin in a position to provision his army by giving him a credit for obtaining goods in this country.(ii.) The political and economic necessity of. establishing security and fostering British trade in the territory reconquered from the Bolsheviks.2. The situation in Russia at the present time is that by conviction 5 per cent, of the population1 are Bolsheviks and 5 eper cent. anti-Bolsheviks. The remaining 90 per cent., including&apos; the great majority of the peasants, are entirely indifferent to the principles involved in the struggle between these two parties, and suffer from the exertions of both. Under Bolshevik rule they are conscripted for service, their moveable property, and more particularly foodstuffs, is requisitioned, and they receive payment only in the form of depreciated paper currency, which is entirely valueless, since it can purchase none of the goods required, for the simple reason that these goods do not exist. Consequently, the peasants do everything possible to secrete the food supplies in their possession, distribution entirely ceases, and the majority of the population, being reduced to starvation, are ready to welcome the Volunteer Armies in the hope of better conditions.3.. During the last two months the military forces of General Denikin have every-where made great strides. On all fronts they have advanced distances varying from 100 to 250 miles, thus recovering immense areas and liberating millions of inhabitants, by whom they are cordially welcomed. The Volunteer Armies, like the Bolsheviks, however, live largely on the country, and though there are considerable stocks of wheat in the Kuban country, the farmers will not accept roubles in payment and will only exchange corn lor clothing and the necessities of life. In default pf payment in kind they will not part with their corn, and the Volunteer Armies will be, forced to requisition
it in exactly the same manner as the Bolsheviks. Such measures, combined with the conscription of the population, will inevitably lead to a great revulsion of feeling and reproduce precisely those conditions which nullified the military advantages gained by Kolchak in the Spring. For reasons mentioned above, fronts in Eussia are never stable.-When they cease to advance they almost inevitably retire, and gains can only be consolidated by material improvement in the conditions of the population behind the line. It is, therefore, an urgent military necessity that Denikin should be put in a position to pay for the maintenance of. his Armies in the only currency which is acceptable,, namely, commodities, and for this purpose the opening of a credit in England of  2,000,000 cannot be too strongly urged.4. The larger question of materially improving economic conditions in the re-occupied area is engaging the earnest attention of the Department of Overseas Trade, which. is sparing no effort to foster trade with South Russia. The latter has enormous potential wealth and will furnish a market of great value to British trade in the future if full advantage is taken of the favourable disposition of the inhabitants now existing towards this country. The French and Italians have realized the possibilities, whilst the Germans also are, making great efforts to re-establish their pre-war position. Whilst this matter is, perhaps, outside the sphere of the General Staff, they would point out that the distribution by Denikin of British goods, purchased with the credit asked for above, would form the best possible trade propaganda, and thus be a step towards securing our future commercial supremacy.Uth July, 1919.
