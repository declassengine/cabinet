This Document h the Property of     /&quot;Si9 Britannic i;k;,,.ji...f c 0jv-or/imentP-TVf?/   *t TITO.ES FOR CilifaDIANS.&apos; &apos;&apos; Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the-%HA1.LJ^^ &apos;      Colonies.In March 1918 the Governor General of Canada for-war-dad a report of the Privy Council on the question of con-ferring, titles of honour upon subjects of His Majesty ordinarily resident in Canada.    The report concluded by requesting that the necessary action might be taken to render effective the following proposals!-3 .    No honour or titular distinction (saving those granted in recognition of military service during the present war or .ordinarily bestowed by the Sovereign pr-oprio. motu) shall be conferred upon a subject of His Majesty ordinarily resident in Canada except with the approval or upon the advice of the Prime Minister of Canada.2.    The Government of the United Kingdom shall exercise the same authority as heretofore in determining the eharacte and number of titles or honours to be allocated to Canada fron time to time.3.    No hereditary title of honour shall hereafter be conferred upon a subject of His Majesty ordinarily resident in Canada,a4.    Appropriate action shall be taken, whether by legislation or otherwise., to provide that after a prescribed period, no title of honour heljl by a subject of His. Majesty now.or hereafter ordinarily resident in Canada shall be re-cognised as having hereditary effect.Mr. Long replied on the 9th of iugust in the despatch of which I annex a copy.On receipt of that de snatch Sir Robert B or den addressed the Governor General as follows&quot;: -&quot;With
,:With respect to the third proposal, Your Excellency advisors would have regarded the second paragraph of the despatch as mcro satisfactory if it had accepted that pro-posal in exact terms.    It seems apparent; however, that the intention is to accept it in substance;   but unless this is distinctly to be understood, they must reiterate their in-sistence upon the third proposal as put forward in the Order-in-Gouncil of the 25th day of March last.YourExcelloncy!s advisers fully realize the diffi-culties alluded to in the last paragraph of the despatch which has reference to. the fourth proposal;   and they are quite willing that this proposal shall remain in abeyance during a reasonable time for its consideration&quot;..In rerjly the Governor General was requested (in a despatch of 1st November 1918) to inform his Prime Minister that ,:His Majesty will not hereafter be advised to confer any hereditary honour on a subject of His Majesty ordinarily resi dentin Canada save on the formal recommendation of the Prime Minister of Canada&quot;.I have now received through the Governor General an Address to the King from the House of Commons of Canada, of which I also annex a copy.I propose, with His Majesty&apos;s concurrence, to reply that the Address has been laid before the King who was pleased, to receive it very graciously;   that he will take it into his consideration, and will in due course intimate his pleasure with regard to the subjects of which it treats.As regards paragraph (a) cf the Addross I consider that the assurance contained in Mr, Long&apos;s despatch should have been accepted .as sufficiently meeting the-wish of theCanadian
Canadian C-overnraent, and I do not think that we should go further.    On this next of the subject the King might be advised to reply that he has no desire to exercise his pre-rogative-of conferring honours in the case of any person ordinarily resident in Canada so long as the grant of sucjp honours is not recommended by the Prime Minister of the Dominion;   that it appears from the Address now submitted that it ia the intention of the Canadian House of Commons that no such recommendations shall be made in future; that it is in the power of the House to enforce its views upon any Prime Minister;   and that the House of Commons may there-fore  rest assured that in these circumstances no honours will be granted in Canada.As regards paragraph (b) of the Address it will be seen that the King is asked to take action by legislation or otherwise.    The second alternative presumably refers to the -prerogative, but in such a matter the King would only exercise his rrevocative on the advice of Ministers in this country.    It would be useless, and I think improper, to ask the Innerial parliament Ho pass an xtct for such a purnose; and without expressinp an opinion as to whether the&apos; preroga-tive would be sufficient I am clear that Ministers would not be justified in advising His Majesty to take action by that means.The matter touches the privileges of the House of Lords and it would be well, if the Lord Chancellor concurs, to refer it to the Committee of Privileges for their advice as to the answer to be returned to paragraph .(b).    It might also bo well to obtain the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown.L&apos; 28.7.1.9. .
Pi. DOWNING .   ,533. 9th August, 1918.My Lord Duke,I have the honour t&amp;Lnform Your Excellency that the Order in Council, approved by yourself on the 25th March relating to the grant of titles of honour upon the subjects of His Majesty ordinarily resident in Canada, has received the careful consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government, who have had the advantage of porsonal conference with Sir Robert BorderSo    Of the four proposals made in the Order in Council, the first and second appear to raise no question.   The first indeed merely embodies the existing practice followed in the Colonial Office for some years pasta With regard to the third, no hereditary honour has been conferred upon a subject of His Majesty ordinarily resident in Canada without consulting the Prims Minister of the Dominion, nor is there any desire on tho part of His Majesty&apos;s Government that any-such honour should be granted oxcept with tho approval of tho Prima Minister of the Dominion.3.    Tho last proposal that appropriate action should ba taken to provide- after a proscribed period - that no honour held by a subjoot of His ICajesty now or hsreaftor ordinarily resident in-.Canada should bo recognised as having hereditary effect, presents many difficulties, and would require very grave consideration;,       I have no doubt that your Ministers will agreo that the question, at least for the present, should remain in. abeyance0I have, etco.(ed.) WALTER H. LONG.!M0R GENERAL HIS SXCILIiiSNGY-TIM DUKE OF DEVONSHIRE, K.G.,G,CXG.,G.C.V.O., etc.,        etc., etc.
TOTHE KINCPS MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY.,MOST GRACIOUS SOVEREIGNVIE, Your M:\jesty&apos;s most dutiful and Loyal subjects, the House of Commons of Canada in Parliament assembled, humbly approach Your Majesty, praying that Your Majesty may be graciously pleased;(a) To refrain hereafter from conferring my % iii jecof honour or titular distinction upon any of your siahj-ects domiciled or ordinarily resident in Canads, save such appellations as are of a professional or vooarbijMm]^yonOTicyto&apos; or which appertain to an office,,(b) To provide that appropriate action be &quot;takenTb/ legislation or otherwise to ensure the extinction of an hereditary title of honour or titular distinction, and of a dignity or title as a peer of the realm, on the death of a person domiciled or ordinarily resident in Canada at present in enjoyment of an hereditary title of honour or titular distinction, or dignity or title as a peer of the realm, and that thereafter no such title of honour, - titular distinction,. or dignity or title as a peer .of the realm, shall be accepted,-enjoyed or used by any person or be recognized.AIJL of which we humbly pray Your l^je-aty-t^JisJse into your favourable and gracious consideration.I (SD) Edgar H,Rhodes. s &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;I Speaker,Touse of Commons; Canada.
