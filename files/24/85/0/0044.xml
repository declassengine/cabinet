Exclusion of Germans from colonies &amp; Protectorates.Memorandum by tbe president of the Board of Trade,With reference to Lord Milnerfs Memorandum of July 14th in whioh it is. proposed that the Colonies and Protectorates should be. ,invite&amp; to pass legislation under whioh the local Government would have a free hand to exclude -for 3 years any subject of a State .lately at war with His Majesty, I think it right to ,remind the War Cabinet   that suoh legislation is only free from objection if confined to persons who remain subjeots of ex-enemy States.    Under the Treaty of peace a number of Germans and Austrians will acquire polish or       q azeoho**$lovukian nationality and it will be obviously necessary to reoognise this new nationality and not pass any legislation whioh isould exclude such persons.Moreover in view of the existence of Commercial treaties, with neutral powers (e,g, Switzerland) Whioh give rights of residenoe in any British territory to the nationals of such powers it would be difficult if not impossible to refuse to recognise the effeot of bou  fide naturalisation by the Governments of such neutrals,    persons of German or Austrian nationality vsho become e.g. Svaiss subjects by naturalisation would therefore have to be exempted from the effeat of such restrictive legislation.It is not therefore possible to enaot legislation in the Colonies and protectorates which will 6nable all persons who ^ere lately our enemies to be excluded from these territories.A.C GEBDLS.30.7,19,
