FUTURE OF COAL MINING.

Note by Sir H. Llewellyn Smith on Lord Gainford&apos;s Memorandum on the Coal Situation.

The practical importance of Lord Gainford&apos;s Cabinet Memorandum on the Coal situation depends less upon the intrinsic merits of his proposal than on the question how far it represents the views of any large and representative section of coal owners. Lord Gainford makes it clear that it is hopeless to expect the coal owners to agree to a scheme on those lines beforehand (see last sentence on page 5) but he leaves us in doubt whether any considerable section would willingly accept and loyally work a scheme of this kind. If not, and we are to regard the memorandum merely as an expression of the views of an individual, it lends itself easily to destructive criticism. If, however, we could regard it as an indication of the solution the coal owners would be prepared, not to propose, but to accept, it certainly marks a great advance from the attitude taken up by Lord Gainford on their behalf before the Sankey Report. Instead of claiming an absolutely free hand in the management of their undertakings, it is now contemplated that the coal owners should consolidate their businesses within districts marked out by a Ministry of Mines, the consolidation being voluntary in the first place, but with the definite threat of compulsion after four years in the background. The Boards of the consolidated Companies are in all cases to contain representation of Labour and of consumers, and a representative of the Ministry of Mines is to have the right to attend Directors&apos; Meetings without a vote. A year ago such a scheme would have been considered to be a very great concession in the direction of associating labour representatives with colliery management. The scheme has considerable attractions, inasmuch as, if successful, it would realise to a large extent the economies of production to be derived from large coal undertakings, while retaining to the full the incentive of private profit and making no fundamental and irrevocable change in the basis of the industry, such as would result from any scheme of public ownership or control. On the other hand, some of these attractions are, from another point of view, weak points in the scheme. As I understand it, it does nothing at all to meet the miners&apos; grievances as regards profiteering, which is regarded by many competent observers, including the Sankey Commission, to be at the root of much of the present social discontent. Sir Arthur Duckham&apos;s scheme, while leaving the control of every District Board in the hand? of the owners, does profess to do something to limit the profits, but the paragraph which proposes this is among those to which Lord Gainford takes exception. The Government would have to consider whether a scheme of this kind is likely to be acceptable to Labour
or to be regarded r..s fulfilling thair plodgs to accept in lottor rnd spirit the rocommmd^tions of tho; first Sonkey report.      It is difficult to gather from Lord G^infordTs Memorandum whet is his position ua to tho financial basis of tho so homo *   This xizs ono of - tho woolcost points of Sir Arthur Duokh&amp;c^s report,&apos; but while Lord Gainford dissents from tho paragraph in which among other things, a Govorn-mont guaronteo of intorost. up to four per cant is proposed, homages no altomativo suggestions     So long as tho con-30lidGtion is a purely voluntary   combination and profits aro not to bo limited, State credit and State compulsion would not appear to bo required,; but some form of indueo-ment or compulsion seems essential in order to on-ruro that the coal owners when consolidating their undertakings, shall in fact follow the lines laid down in the memorandum, i,e. givo representation to Labour and to tho Gonsumors and admit a Government representative to their Boards.     In any case no voluntary combination is at all likely to cover the whole  round, and if and when, tho Government have to step in and force the, recalcitrant coal owners&apos; to join the combination, somo kind of financial guarantee on the part of tho State will presumably be necessary,.    Lord Gainford&apos;s memorandum is entirely nebulous as regards this matter.   It is true that Lord Gainford supports the nationalisation of mining royalties and it would bo possible, as and when.leasea expire, for the Government to refuse any renewals0 oi-rcept to Members-of. the Statutory 6qmbiriation, but this indirect form of com-pulsion would only act very partially and slowly0     To sum up, lord Gainford1s proposals are in no sense a substitute for any of the schemes that have been put- forward for the public control of coal minings.   They might, however be amended,. so as to form a more or less convenient half-way house, If the coal owners and minors could bo induced/to accept theme   \ see no reason to change my view that if the Government wish to deal drastically with the coal trade and bring it under real, public&apos;control,&apos; some scheme like that which I.have already  ent. forward, would be necessary0    I realise, howevers to&apos; phefull that tho course indicated in my scheme, is one trim&apos; which, when it is once set up, there is no turning back, aid there is much to be said for beginning by setting up a Ministry of Mines and nationalising coal royalties and encouraging   -combinations with Labour admitted to their Boards, as a firsi step.   If, however, this view were accepted in prinoiple,     \  here would&apos;be a great many criticisms to mate in regard to details,For example, Lord Gainford1s sohemo contains no prote^ti^ clauses for the consumer or the public generslly (except the very inadequate safeguards&apos;of admission of a single consumer^ representative to each Board).,. either against unreasonably high prices, or unfair preference in prices and supplies. It seems dangerous to consolidate the control of coal supplies . in the hands of fifteen to twenty combinations (which of course will seek to enter into working and price agreements among themselves) without very much stronger measures for the protection of the public.    But it is a question whether the enactment of the necessary safeguards would not so greatly discourage voluntary combinations as to force us back to the consideration of a more drastic scheme of public control. All this could only be ascertained by discussion.with the interests concerned,(Initialled)     Ho LI. S,Aupust, 1919,
