This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government,* - - 394WAR CABINET.BILL OF INDEMNITY AND STATUTE Of LIMITATIONS  - ui9042 mMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.1. The Interdepartmental Committee on the Indemnity Bill and Statute of Limitations which was set up by the Home Affairs Committee of the War Cabinet at their 29th Meeting on the 23rd May, 1919, have submitted an interim report (copy annexed) with a view to obtaining a decision on the policy which should govern the granting of compensation in respect of loss of or damage to property or business in the United Kingdom, occasioned by the exercise of rights and duties under the prerogative of the Crown and the powers conferred by the Defence of the Realm Acts.2. The prerogative of the Crown has been exercised so far as ships are concerned, Shipping, under a Royal Proclamation issued on the 3rd August, 1914, which provided that shipowners should receive payment for the use of their ships and for the services rendered during their employment in Government service.The Board of Arbitration set up to deal with these, claims held that claims for indirect and consequential damage arising from the requisitioning of ships could not be entertained. The rates of freight paid for the use of requisitioned ships are not market rates, but rates settled by a Committee of shipowners on the basis of a fair commercial profit on the pre-war capital value of the vessels, irrespective of the freight market. Although the original rates were somewhat in excess of the then current market rates, nevertheless, owing to the subsequent large increase in the market rates, a vast sum, estimated at 300,000,000/., has been saved to the State on freights alone. On the whole, shipowners have accepted these rates, but in some cases they have reserved all-their rights against the Crown in respect of indirect and consequential loss. There are also claims by charterers, cargo-owners and other persons interested, involving further large sums.3. No provision was made in the first instance for the payment of compensation Other in respect of loss of, or damage to, property requisitioned under the Defence ofProPerty&apos; the Realm Acts and Regulations, but in March, 1915, the Government set up the Defence of the Realm Losses Commission to deal with claims for direct and substantial     loss or damage.   Generally speaking, the Commission awarded compensation upon the following principles: (a.) In the case of loss of, or damage to, land and buildings : direct and substantial loss. &apos;(b.) In the case of the requisition of goods, or the output of factories : the actual cost price or cost of production (as the case may be) of such goods, plus a reasonable pre-war rate of profit.4. The principle laid down in (a) was settled by the Warrant under which the Commission was set up. The principle laid down in (6) was determined by the provisions of the Defence of the Realm Regulations 2b and 7. These principles do not allow for the payment of indirect or consequential loss or damage, and cases are now before the Courts where the vires of the principles are being expressly raised. -  .5. Should the Courts decide against the vires of these principles very large claims in respect of the assessment of direct loss at market rates would undoubtedly be put forward. It is impossible to assess these claims accurately, but representatives of the Departments concerned estimate that the following sums may be involved : (i.) Claims for freight of requisitioned ships over and above Blue  Book rates       ......      ......&apos;    ......... 300,000,000(ii.) Claims for loss of or damage to land, buildings and goods overand above the compensation already paid     ......... 21,000,000
1, !&apos; ..; ;    &apos;     2 ; ^  ;.f; &apos;If the Court should. also hold that compensation is payable for indirect and consequential loss, it is similarly estimated that the following further sums ;,may be involved: (iii.) Claims by shipowners, charterers, cargo-owners and others         interested in ships       ......      ...      .........   300,000,000(iv.) Claims for loss of or damage to land, buildings or goods     ...    50,000,0006. The Committee ask for the decision of the War Cabinet as to whether (i) claims for indirect and consequential loss or damage should be barred and (ii) the principles on which compensation has hitherto been paid for direct and substantial loss should be validated.7. Assuming affirmative decisions on these points, the Committee propose two alternative clauses, which are set out in Appendix B of their report. The first alternative bars all actions against the Crown for loss or damage arising out of the war, leaving claims to be dealt with on an ex gratia basis as at present by the Board of Arbitration and the Defence of the Realm Losses Commission. The second alternative similarly bars all actions, but gives a statutory right to prefer claims before these Tribunals to be dealt with by them on the principles hitherto applied.8. I am of opinion that claims for indirect and consequential loss should be barred and that the principles of compensation hitherto applied ex gratia should be placed on a statutory basis, and I therefore recommend that the second alternative proposed by the Committee should be approved.2nd August, 1919.WINSTON S.

The Committee on Home Affairs at their 29th Meeting, on the 23rd May, 1919, approved the War Office proposal for the appointment of an Interdepartmental Committee to draft a General Bill of Indemnity and Statute of Limitations, as recommended by Lord Cave&apos;s Committee. The Committee was accordingly constituted as set out above, and three meetings have been held.2. In the course of their investigation the Committee were faced with the difficult position that had arisen with regard to claims for compensation in respect of(b19/333)  100 7/19 h&amp;s  7327wo
loss or damage to property or business in the United Kingdom occasioned by the exercise or purported exercise of rights or duties under the Prerogative of the Crown and the Defence of the Realm Acts and Regulations.---3.&quot; Acting on the assumption that the owner had no legal right to, compensation, the Government, with the approval of the House of Commons on the 31st March, 1915, set up a Royal Commission of Inquiry (at first known as the Duke Commission and subsequently as the Defence of the Realm Losses Commission), to deal with the. question of compensation to be paid (in cases not otherwise provided for) in respect of direct and substantial loss incurred or damage sustained by reason of interference with property or business through the exercise by the Crown of rights and duties in the Defence of the Realm. This principle of compensation has been applied ever since in the case of land and buildings, both those requisitioned under the Defence of the Realm Regulations and, indirectly, those taken by agreement, since the rents arranged in the latter cases were based on the sums which would have been awarded had compulsory powers been used. The terms of reference of the Commission preclude the granting of compensation for indirect loss or damage.4. The question of compensation was discussed in the House of Commons on the Second Reading of the Defence of the Realm (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1915, and in the course of the debate the present Prime Minister, in outlining the proposals of the Government for establishing the Duke Commission, said &quot;I do not think you&apos; can therefore hope to have the same complete measure of compensation which you would enforce in times of peace, where you take one man&apos;s property for the benefit of the public. After all, this is for the general defence of the realm.&quot; (See Official Reports, vol. 70, col. 1460). And subsequently on the debate on the adjournment for the Easter Recess, the names of the Commissioners and the terms of reference were communicated to the House, which, as no criticism was offered, must be taken to have been generally accepted by them..   (See Official Reports, vol. 70, col. 1846.)5. The position of the Crown with regard to legal liability for compensation in respect of commandeered lands or buildings was first raised in the Shoreham Aerodrome case, in which the Court of first instance and Court of Appeal both decided that there was no legal liability. When the case was argued in the House of Lords, however, doubts as to the correctness of this view were expressed by certain members of that tribunal, and this case was ultimately settled on the basis that the land should be deemed to have been taken under the Defence Act 1842, and that compensation should be paid on the basis of the Lands&apos; Clauses Acts. This caused Considerable doubt as to the position of the Crown, and the point was again raised in the De Keysers Hotel case, in which a judgment in favour of the Crown by the Court of first instance, was reversed by the Court of Appeal, who held that, although the buildings in question had been commandeered for war purposes, the owners were entitled to compensation under the old Defence Act 184Z, which, in eiiect, means compensation on the basis of the Lands&apos; Clauses Acts. Tiiat case is now under appeal to the House of Lords, but it is not anticipated that judgment will be given before next year. In the meantime claimants are naturally reluctant to submit their claims to the Losses Commission, and the -administrative position is one of great difficulty, as, should the House of Lords decide against the Crown, there would be a general demand which would be very difficult to resist, for the re-opening of claims which have been dealt with on the loss basis. These claims, if re-opened, would involve the re-assessment of an enormous number of cases which the Department would be unable to check as they would not now be in a position to obtain the necessary evidence, while the additional cost to the State might well run into millions.6. ^In the case of the Cannon Brewery Company v. Central Control Board (Liquor Traffic) a case of acquisition as opposed -to temporary occupation the Courts decided (that the prerogative of the Crown did not apply to the action of the Board and that the Company were entitled to compensation on the basis laid down in the Lands Clauses Acts, in respect of licensed premises compulsorily acquired under the Defence ef the Realm (Amendment) (No. 3) Act 1915.7. In 1916 a Defence of the Realm Regulation (No. 2 B) was made giving certain Government Departments power to take possession of war material, food, forage and stores of any description, and in 1917 an amendment was made defining the principles to be applied in arriving at the price to be paid for such articles (see Appendix A). The price Was not necessarily to be the market price, but the reasonable cost to the owner plus the rate of profit usually earned in respect of similar goods before the war.   This it will be seen is a departure from the principle of
compensation on the loss basis. A similar basis of compensation is laid down in Regulation No. 7 in regard to the output of factories requisitioned by the Government.8. Under Regulation 2 B the War Department have requisitioned enormous quantities of wool tops, hides and leather, and the principles of compensation there laid down have been applied. If it is ultimately held that the Regulation, in so far as it lays down these principles of compensation is ultra vires the Defence of the Realm Acts, it follows that the Government Departments which have acted on this Regulation will find themselves in an extremely difficult position. A Petition of Right (the Newcastle Breweries case) is now pending, in which a claim is being made in respect of the compulsory requisitioning of rum by the Admiralty, where the question of the vires of the principle of compensation is being expressly raised.9. Tiie Committee were informed that with a view to disposing of the doubts which had arisen with regard to the validity of this Regulation, a suggestion had been made that some words should be inserted in the War Emergency Laws (Continuance) Bill, in order to validate retrospectively the principles laid down in&quot; it for the assessment of compensation. As, however, the matter was the subject of pending litigation, the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown was asked, and they advised that the better course would be to let the issue raised in the Newcastle Breweries case be decided, as they did not think it desirable to introduce retrospective legislation. No action therefore was taken to deal with this matter in&apos; the War Emergency Laws (Continuance) Bill.10. Other cases were brought before the Committee by representatives of the Departments concerned in which it appeared necessary that provision should be made to deal with claims for compensation. These cases fall within the following categories: (a.) Claims of shipowners for consequential loss arising out of the compulsoryrequisitioning of their vessels. (b.) Claims for indirect damage or loss, which the Defence of the Realm LossesCommission held to be outside their jurisdiction.II. With regard to cases failing under (a) of the preceding paragraph, the Admiralty, by virtue of a Royal Proclamation, dated the 3rd August, 1914, have powers to requisition ships within the territorial waters of the United Kingdom for such period as may be necessary, on condition that the owners of such ships receive payment for their use and for services rendered during their employment in Govern-ment service, together with compensation for loss or damage thereby occasioned. A Board of Arbitration (known as Lord Mersey&apos;s Board) was subsequently constituted to assess the sums to be paid to shipowners in accordance with agreement. Lord Mersey, the Chairman of the Board, ruled that &quot; compensation for loss or damage thereby occasioned&quot; means compensation for the loss of or damage to the requisitioned ship, and excludes claims for indirect or consequential damage and special claims in respect of such damage brought by shipowners before the Board were after enquiry rejected.12. The principle of the rates of hire, upon which the &quot;Blue Book&quot; rates adopted by the Board are based, is that shipowners should receive a rate affording a fair commercial return on a pre-war capital value of their vessels, irrespective of the freight market, though the enormous increase in the cost of running ships rendered it necessary to increase these rates substantially in March, 1918.13. Shipowners as a whole have not been unwilling to submit cases of dispute to the Mersey Board, but it is by no means clear, since the De Keyser s Hotel case, whether they would not have a legal right to claim compensation from the Crown through the machinery of a Petition of Right, if they desire to do so. Some shipowners have, in fact, while accepting Blue Book rates, reserved all their rights against the Crown, and the De Keyser case will no doubt encourage them to proceed by Petition of Right.The Proclamation of the 3rd August deals only with payment &quot;for the use&quot; of the ship, and does not cover permanent acquisition. The Admiralty have in numerous cases requisitioned ships for acquisition; but doubts have been raised as to whether thyy were entitled to do so under the prerogative. To remove these doubts and to provide for the basis of compensation in such cases a Bill was drafted in 1917 referring to the Board the determination of the compensation and requiring that it should be assessed on the assumption that the ship was not capable of earning during the war freights at rates in excess of the Blue Book rates. The Bill was not, however, introduced. Consequently, a large number of claims for indirect and consequential loss arising from shipowners being deprived of their vessels are(7327)       . A 2
outstanding. The Committee are of opinion that these claims, which run into millions, should either be barred or the principles upon which compensation is to be granted therefor settled. If the De Keyser Hotel case should be thought to throw any doubts on the competence of Lord Mersey&apos;s Board to decide all cases arising under the Proclamation, such doubts should be set at rest and the Board itself given a statutory and exclusive authority.14. The Ministry of Shipping occupies a slightly different position to that of the Admiralty with regard to the requisitioning of ships. Under the Act creating the office of Shipping Controller, Regulations may be made under the Defence of the Realm Act conferring, upon the Controller such powers as may be necessary for carrying out the duties of his office. Such Regulations have, in fact, been made and empower him inter alia to requisition ships or to require owners to place ships at his disposal, and such Regulations expressly provide (in the same terms as the Proclamation of the 3rd of August, 1914), that disputes as to compensation shall be decided by Lord Mersey&apos;s Board. It is thought, therefore, that as regards ships requisitioned by the Shipping Controller, Lord Mersey&apos;s Board has statutory jurisdiction, but it by no means follows that the Courts would hold that the Board&apos;s jurisdiction is an exclusive one, and that the principles upon which that Board have acted in assessing compensation, are correct. To this extent, therefore, the same observations apply as in the case of ships requisitioned by the Admiralty. The Ministry of Shipping have not requisitioned ships for acquisition.15. The Defence of the Realm Losses Commission will not entertain claims for losses to shipowners, holding that in view of the existence of the Mersey Board they are &quot; otherwise provided for &quot; within the terms of the Commission&apos;s warrant, but they have entertained claims by persons interested in the requisition of ships other than the owner, such as charterers, cargo owners and others, though in the majority of cases the claims have failed because the losses were considered to be indirect. If the rigid rule that compensation can only be claimed for direct loss is upset by the De Keyser Hotel case or other decisions of the Court, claims by charterers and merchants whose business has been interfered with by the requisition of ships are likely to be immense.16. As regards (b) of paragraph 10 the action taken by the military authorities in Ireland during the rebellion of 1916 and at other times has given rise to a number of claims in respect of damage to, and the requisitioning of, property. Although many of these claims have been dealt with either by the Defence,of the Realm Losses Commission or by the Dublin Property Losses Committee a special Committee set up to award compensation for losses sustained in Dublin during the rebellion, several have been rejected by these bodies or reduced by them, either on the ground that the claims did not fall within their jurisdiction, or for some other reason. These rejected claims, and claims which have not so far been brought forward, may mature into civil actions in Ireland, where it is thought that juries would not be unsympathetic.Another class of claims which will arise in Ireland are those on the action taken by the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland in the exercise of their powers for enforcing the cultivation of land with a view to maintaining the food supply of the country under Defence of the Realm Regulations 2 L, 2 M and 2 P. A large number of such claims are still outstanding, and these should either be barred or the basis of compensation settled.There are cases of a similar nature in England, where claims have either been rejected, not fully satisfied, or not dealt with by the Defence of the Realm Losses Commission. It is anticipated that a considerable number of actions will be started in England in respect of these claims.17. In these circumstances, the Committee are impressed with the importance of arriving at a conclusion as to whether the principles of compensation applied during the war should be validated retrospectively, or their validity left for decision by the Courts of Justice. Having regard to the opinion expressed by the Law Officers in the Newcastle Breweries case (see paragraph 9) the Committee did not at first feel justified in recommending validating legislation which would reverse the decision given in the De Keyser Hotel case, and would be contrary to the opinion expressed by &quot;the Law Officers. The Solicitor-General, who attended the later meetings of the Committee, stated, however, that as a result of hearing the arguments put forward by the. departments concerned, the Law Officers had come to the conclusion that as the question was mainly one of policy, the Committee should not hesitate by reason of the opinion they had previously expressed, to recommend that the question should be dealt
with in a comprehensive manner on the broad facts, notwithstanding that any legislation might retrospectively affect cases already the subject of litigation.18. The Committee feel that they cannot satisfactorily proceed with the drafting of the Bill without first obtaining the decision of the War Cabinet on the policy to be adopted. Although the cases referred to above fall into separate categories, the point to be decided in each case is the same, namely, whether a legal right to compensation is to be recognized in respect of loss of or damage to property or business in the United Kingdom occasioned by the exercise or purported exercise of rights, powers, or duties, under the prerogative of the Crown and the Defence of the Realm Acts and -Regulations, and if so upon what principle such compensation is to be assessed.19. The4, principles on. which compensation has been assessed are (a) in the case of the requisitioning of ships: Freights based on pre-war rates with the addition of a liberal percentage; (b) in the case of goods requisitioned under Regulation 2 B and output of factories under Defence of the Realm Regulation 7 : Cost price plus reasonable profit; and (c) in other cases : The amount of direct loss.With regard to (a) the Blue Book rates were settled by a Committee of shipowners. With regard to (b) the principle laid down in Regulations 2 B and 7 was the only feasible method of preventing exorbitant claims, especially in the case of commodities of which the greater part were required for war purposes, as the purchases by the Government necessarily put up market prices. With regard to (c) this principle of compensation cannot be said to be unreasonable since the land or property was damaged or requisitioned as the case may be for the general benefit of the community during a time of national, emergency, and there appears to be no logical reason why the person suffering the damage or loss should receive compensation on a profiteering basis, which would be the case if the compensation awarded was based on the Lands Clauses Acts in respect of land and on the market price in respect of goods. On the other hand, the fact must not be overlooked that owners who were fortunate enough not to have their property requisitioned were able to take advantage of the enhanced prices prevailing.20. It is clear that as matters now stand no claims for compensation for the taking of or damage to land and buildings can be settled until the De Keyser s. Hotel case is finally determined ; if this case and the Newcastle Breweries case are decided against the Government innumerable claims will be sprung upon them running into many millions of pounds, and there will be a strong moral claim by persons who have accepted the awards of the Defence of the Realm Losses Commission to have their cases re-opened.21. The Committee do not fail to appreciate the strength of the opposition to any validating legislation which would have the effect of setting aside legal decisions already given and depriving claimants of rights which they assume, or may have been led to believe, they possess. At the same time they do not consider that claimants who refuse compensation on the basis accepted in the majority of cases should benefit by such action. Serious consequences must ensue from the wholesale multiplication of claims against the Crown which in a large number of cases it would be impossible for the Crown to bring evidence to rebut.22/ Alternative clauses have been drafted by Parliamentary Counsel to provide for the matters above referred to, and are set out with a.covering memorandum by , Sir Frederick Liddell in Appendix B.23. Decisions of the War Cabinet are, therefore, urgently required as to whether  1(a.) All recourse to the Courts of Law should be prohibited in-cases of loss or damage occasioned by the exercise of the prerogative rights of the Crown or of the powers conferred by the Defence of the Realm Acts.(6.) The principles of compensation on which the Board of Arbitration in the case of shipping and the Defence of the Realm Losses Commission in other cases have hitherto acted should be retrospectively validated.(c.) In the event of (a) and (&amp;) being decided affirmatively which, if either, of the clauses set out in Appendix B should be followed.-July. 1919.
appendices.APPENDIX A.EXTRACT FROM REGULATION 2B DEALING WITH COMPENSATION TO BE PAID FOR THE:REQUISITION OF GOODS. *Where any goods, possession of which has been so taken, are acquired by the Admiralty,1 Army Council or Air Council or the Minister of Munitions,-tinj price to be paid in respect thereof shall in default of agreement be determined by the tribunal by which claims for compensation under these regulations are, in the absence of any express provision to the contrary, determined.In determining such price regard need not be had to the market price, but shall be had (a.) If the goods are acquired from the grower or producer thereof, to the cost of production and to the rate of profit usually earned by him in respect of similar goods before the war and to whether such rate of profit was unreasonable or excessive, and to any other circumstances of the case.(b.) If the goods are acquired from any person other than the grower or producer thereof, to the price paid by such person for the goods and to whether such price was unreasonable or excessive, and to the rate of profit usually earned in respect of the sale of similar goods before the war, aud to whether such rate or profit was unreasonable or excessive, and to any other circumstances of the case; so, however, that if the person from whom the goods are acquired himself acquired the the goods otherwise than in the usual course of his business, no allowance, or an allowance at a reduced rate, on account of profit shall be made.Provided that where by virtue of. these regulations or any order made thereunder the sale of the goods at a price above any price fixed thereunder is prohibited the price assessed under this regulation shall not exceed the price so fixed.APPENDIX B.PROVISIONS AS TO COMPENSATION FOR REQUISITIONING OF AND DAMAGE TO PROPERTY.The two clauses set out below are suggested as alternative methods of dealing with claims for compensation for the exercise, during the war, of the prerogative and of powers under the Defence of the Realm Acts.Both clauses absolutely bar all proceedings of the courts, aud would render void all actions already commenced, such as the De Keyser Hotel case and the Newcastle Breweries case.First alternative. They differ, inasmuch as the first alternative gives no right to compensation, but leaves payment of compensation to be made ex gratia, and leaves undetermined the tribunals by which the amounts to be paid as compensation are-to be assessed. It would be open to the Government under the clause to extend the terms of reference of the Losses Commission and the Mersey Hoard of Arbitration so as to include compensation for indirect loss. Probably, if it is determined that compensation is to be paid for indirect loss, it would be well to add words showing such intention, such as the following : &quot; and any such tribunal may include in their assessment of compensation, compensation for indirect as well .as direct loss or damage.&quot;At the present moment the terms of reference to the Losses Commission exclude from their jurisdiction cases &quot;otherwise provided ftfr.&quot; The effect of the clause barring all legal remedies would extend the scoje of their jurisdiction, inasmuch as there would be no cases otherwise provided for. The clause as drawn will include claims for compensation for the acquisition of property by the Liquor Control Board, as that property has been acquired in pursuance of powers conferred by regulations made under an enactment relating to the defence of the Realm.Second alteniative.-Th.ti second alternative, after taking away all rights of recourse to the courts, gives a specific right to claim compensation based on definite principles by specified arbitration tribunals. In some cases under the Defence of the Realm Regulations, e.g., Regulations 2 B, 2 C and 7, both the principle on which compensation is to be assessed and the tribunal by which it is to be assessed are laid down; in others, e.ff., Regulation 2 L, the tribunal only is specified. The clause preserves the special principles and special tribunals for the assessment of compensation in cases to which the regulations in questiou relate. The clause also preserves the provisions of the Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Land) Act in cases where land has been acquired under that Act. Apart from these special provisions the clause proposes to divide claims for compensation into two categories, those relating to ships and those relating to other property. All cases of compensation for damage relating to the requisitioning of ships, whether for temporary use or for permanent acquisition, are to be dealt with by the Mersey Board of Arbitration ; the compensation for the use of ships being limited to the payment of what are known as the Blue Book rates, and the compensation in the case of acquisition being fixed according to the value of the ship, on the assumption that the ship could not, during the war, have earned rates in excess of the Blue Book rates. In other cases the assessment tribunal will, under the clause, be the Losses Commission, and the principles on which compensation is to be assessed will be the principles oh which that Commission have hitherto acted, i.e., the loss basis.The second alternative form of the clause is applicable only to the United Kingdom. If it is adopted, special provision would have to be made for adapting the clause to the circumstances of India and the various colonies.
First Alternative.No action or other legal proceeding shall be instituted in any court of law to recover damages or compensation in respect of the exercise or purported exercise during and for the purposes of the present war, of any prerogative right of His Majesty or of any power under any enactment relating to the defence of the Realm, or any regulation or order made thereunder, and if .any such proceeding has been instituted, whether before or after the passing of this Act, it shall be discharged and become void ;Provided that nothing in this section shall prevent applications being made to any special tribunal which may have been or may be established, whether by statute or otherwise, for assessing compensation in respect of any loss or damage occasioned by the exercise or purported exercise of any such right or power as aforesaid.Second Alternative.1. No action or other legal proceeding shall be instituted in any court of law,to recover damages or compensation in respect of the exercise, or purported exercise, during and for the purposes of the present war, of any prerogative right of His Majesty or of any power under any enactment relating to the defence of the Realm, or any regulation or order made thereunder, and if any such proceeding has been instituted, whether before or after the passing of this Act, it shall be discharged and become void.Provided that any person who has suffered any direct and substantial loss in consequence of the exercise or purported exercise of any such right or power as aforesaid shall be entitled to compensation assessed on the principles and by the tribunal hereinafter mentioned2. The compensation payable shall be assessed in accordance with the following principles : (i.) Where, under the Defence of the Realm Regulations, any special principle for assessment of compensation is contained in the regulation, compensation shall be assessed in accordance with that principle.(ii.) Where the compensation is payable for the use of a ship, it shall be in accordance with the principles adopted by the Board of Arbitration, constituted under the proclamation issued on the 3rd August, 1914.(iii.) Where the compensation is payable in respect of the acquisition of n ship, it shall be assessed onthe assumption that the ship was not, during the war, capable of earning freight at rateshigher than such rates-as aforesaid, (iv.) Where the compensation is payable in respect of land acquired under the Defence of the Realm(Acquisition of Land) Act, 1916, it shall be assessed in accordance with the provisions of thatAct as amended by any subsequent enactment, (v.) In any other case the compensation shall be assessed in accordance with the principles uponwhich the (Jommission appointed by His Majesty (commonly known as the Defence of the realm Losses Commission) has hitherto acted in cases where no special provision is made asto the assessment of compensation.3. The tribunal for assessing compensation shall, where by any of the Defence of the Realm Regulations any special tribunal is prescribed, be that tribunal, and where land has been acquired under the Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Land) Act, 1916, be the tribunal to which claims for compensation are by that Act as amended by any subsequent enactments, to be referred, and in cases where the property in question is a ship be the said Board of Arbitration, and in any other case be the said Defence of the Realm Losses -Commission.P. f. LIDDELL.
