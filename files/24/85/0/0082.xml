WAR CABINET.ARMIES AND ECONOMICS.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.Mr. Balfour&apos;s complaint in CT. 7846 of the absence of any military force to support the decisions of the Peace Conference and the consequent impotence of that body is not justified so far as Great Britain is concerned.Ten British divisions in good order stand upon the Rhine and will obey orders to go to any place which the Cabinet may wish. Whether it will be wise to involve them in Central European disputes is another question. But there they are and there they have been kept with.no enemy in front of them for the last six months at a great expense. -There is no validity in the plea that force is not available. There is plenty of force ; it is the decision to employ it which has been lacking.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.4th August, 1919.(b19/    )  70  8/19  h&amp;s  V387wo
