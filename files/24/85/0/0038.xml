He himself admitted before Court Martial in 1916 that he was bom in America, and stated that he was not a British subject though he had always regarded himself as an Irishman,,We recommended the Army Authorities to make the necessary orders to keep him out of both Great Britain and Ireland^ and they now write me suggesting that the question should be submitted to the Cabineto    Would you kindly let me know whether you think this course is really necessary?
