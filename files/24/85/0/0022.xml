As early as the begirding of May, the Central Control Board rooorded their view that, as they were essentially a war-emergency body, it was desirable that a transfer ofpowers to a new authority suitable to peace conditions , &apos; should not be unduly delayed.    I informed the Liquor Be-striotions Committeeof the farCabinet of this view, and that  $mmittea in their report to the V/ar Cabinet of tho 28th May, while adristag&apos;that legislation should be intro-duced for dealing with the post-war regulation of tho liquor traffic, pointed out that some existing authority must be instructed by the War Cabinet to maintain a proper form of interim regulation, and strongly reoommended that Parliamentary publicity should be given to such instructions - &quot;without delay* and in any oase before the Whitsuntide re-cess&quot;.Ho such instructions having yet been given, it becomes necessary again to call attention to certain aspects of the present situation.In.the last five or six months the Board have made * successive relaxations of their scheme of restrictions upon&quot;the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor in licensed premises and clubs, the cumulative effect of which is oon-siderable, and a point has now been reaohed at which.tho Board can do little if anything to meet demands pressed by this or that section of the public for further relaxations, without undermining the whole fabric.     It is vury difficult, however, for tho Board, without express Government; support, to withstand the pressure which is being brought to boar on them at the present time, and it may be admitted thatsome/
86th July, 1919,It will be remembered that in November last the Prime Minister and Mr., Bonar Law jointly pledged themselves to endeavour to secure a proper adaptation to peace condi-tions of the experience gained during the war in regard to the traffic in drink.some of tho war-time restrictions which still remainin force are not likely to form part of a peace-time co&amp;o.On the other hand tho nation will not obtain due benefit from the remarkable advance in sobriety and the new kno\ -xledge gained during tho last few years,   if many more of the restrictions have disappeared before Parliament has had the opportunity of considering the legislation re-quired in connection with the abolition of the Board.It Is therefore of imperative importance that a de-finitc mission or mandate should be conferred upon the Bo?:,rd for the period which must still elapse before the establishment by Parliament of a new authority, and that it should be announced that the Central Control Board have been instructed by the Government to maintain the present position, until the whole subject has been dis-cussed by Parliament, and a suitable post-war system has been established.(Signed) D*AMRN0B.
