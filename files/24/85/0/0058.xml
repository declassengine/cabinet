idHUEnill&apos;.-This    WnentjsjjB property is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s GovernmentSECRET. G,Ta785QWAR. CABINET,A MINISTRY OF RfiSBARCH.Memorandum by the Parliamentary Secretary of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.In the consideration of the memorandum &quot;by the President 6f the Board of Education [G. 234] on the establishment of a Ministry of Research, I wish to put before the Cabinet the special position which the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries occupy.o - iWith the help of the Development Fund a considerable organisation for agricultural research has already been built up since 1912,    Institutes for research on soil questions, animal nutrition, plant breeding, plant physiology, plant pathology, dairying and agricultural economics have already been established, and discussions are proceeding in regard to the establishment of two further Institutes, one to deal with machinery and the other with animal pathology.    Discussions are also proceeding as to the extensien of research in connection with fishery questions.The Board themselves also conduct a certain amount of research.    They have their own Veterinary Laboratory.    The Board1e advisers on entomology and mycology are to have a laboratory close to the Research Laboratory c*n Plant Pathology at Rothamated.    The Board have also a laboratory for shell-fish investigation at Conway and have other developments in prospect.    Increased funds for research have been placed at the disposal of the Board (H.A.C. 18 Min. 3) and are to be distributed by the Development Commission like the ether research funds.The work of the R-search Institutes is oarried en with funds derived from the Development Commission but is under the administrative control and inspection of the Beard, who report to the Development Commission on the work done and on the requirements of the Institutes.    The Institutes,however, are not administered directly by the Board, but by a University or some similar academic organisation.    -flhile the Board have never desired to conduct the necessary research in agriculture or fisheries or even to direct it in the sense of making the investigators Civil Servants primarily responsible to the Board, they attach the utmost importance to the close contact they now possess with the research institutions through the administrative control and inspection which they exerciea.,    Research in agriculture is closely bound up with both administration and oducation and the board&apos;s work in their constructive proposals for dealing with the agricultural industry, is and will bo increasingly coloured by research.    For these reasons they could never accept the position of having to go to another Department and indent upon it for research in particular amounts or directions, with the conduct of which research they would thuii have no concern..    The essential feature as far as the Board ar^ concerned is that they shall be in oontinual contact with the investigators, for whose work in many cases they alone can provide material and other facilities.I should wish to urge, further, that the present form of organisation under the Development Commission works reasonably well.    The Development Commission act in two ways - (l) as a sympathetic adviser to the Treasury with a fund to draw upon for the necessary expenditure, (2) as the United Kingdom co-ordinating
authority for agricultural research, each institute being regarded as serving United Kingdom requirements.    The Development Commission do not, however, directly exercise executive powers, hut work through the Department who report to the Commission.    I should not objeot to the Development Commission being constituted Branch IV.  of Mr. ffisher&apos;8 proposed liinistry, provided it continued to work through the Department as it does at present.    There are occasions when agricultural research impinges upon other Investigations and&quot; where joint action with other branches of the new Ministry might be desirable.     This fact has already been recognised in that all the research institutions set up, with the one exception of the old-established Experiment Station at Rothamsted, have been placed at one or other University.    Again as regards the proposed Institute for Human Nutrition to be set up at Cambridge, the Board have already indicated that while they are not willing to merge the Institute of Animal Nutrition in the new institute, they would join in every possible way in a ccmbined programme.    The proposed institute for animal pathology is to be set up where it can be closely associated with or even form a part of a School of Medicine.In thus asking for special treatment of agricultural research. I would urge that (as far as England and V/ales are^ concerned) the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries are the only Department of State solely constituted to deal with two industries, which by their &amp;sgnitude and special characters of great sub-division and both widespread and scattered distribution, are marked off from all other industries.    The special position of agriculture in this respect has already been recognised both with regard to labour and higher education.    While I have every sympathy with Mr. Fisher&apos;8 proposal for a Ministry of Research&apos;l would urge that the existing organisation for agricultural research should not be jeopardised in the pursuit of Departmental symmetry.I may add that this was considered by Lord Brnle and approved by him upon hiB resignation.ARTHUR G. BOSCAIEN. 11st August, 1919.
