Hon. David Lloyd George, Ivf.P,t 10, Downing street, London, S*W.Daar Sir,I am instructed by a resolution of my Executive Committee to write you with a request that my Exeoutive Committee be permitted at an early date to state the ease of this Society for increased wages rates for our members before yourself and your V/ar Cabinet.someThe reason for this request is that after/ six months negotiation my Executive have to-day received from the Railway Executive Committee their final word and offer on wages increase for drivers, motormen, firemen, and cleaners, and as the amounts of increase offered is nothing approaching the demands of the Society and the feelings of our members in the country aro intense; my Executive feel it to be their duty to lay the ease before the Cabinet as a final effort before laying the whole position before our members.I am asked to point out to you that whilst Sir Herbert Walker and his colleagues have been patient and courteous during the lengthy negotiations, my Executive feel that the Railway Executive are themselves empowered to go no further than the present offer, hence their bringing the matter directly to your notice.We feel that in spite of what has been eonceded in conditions other than wages, that the grades we represent have gained the least bf all railwaymen and we feel that the wages of our members must be increased in nearer proportion to the dangerous, arduous, dirty, and responsible duties which they perfoim.Trusting you may be able to accede to our request,I am,Yours faithfully,(Sd.) J. Bromley.General Secretary.
