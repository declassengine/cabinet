Add I son *The Memorandum of the Chancellor of the Exchequer (G.T.7729) ro.ises issues which affect and indeed may determine the possibility of peaceful and orderly social and industrial restoration.   These great unforeseen additions to expenditure clearly depend upon policy;   also they nay well arise out of a lack of policy.   It may well be that the VaFTJabinet has not hitherto had sufficient oppor-twritf for considering and determining the important questions involved, some of which,. I suggest., might well he discussed and considered in conjunction with&apos;other*l^nia^CeTPlT  Tt is clear, for example, taking my own case, that as the Housing and Health pro-grammes develop and depend upon finance, the fate of them might well be involved in decisions affecting expenditure for exampTS, &quot;&quot;upon our Naval and Military Forces..Taking therefore, by way of illustration only the first two of the items on the list supplied by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(1) The amount over the original estimates in the case of the Navy is  23,500,000.   What is our Naval Policy and against what contingencies does the proposed expenditure seek to provide?   In this connection, two facts of great importance are obvious (a) the German Wavy is. beneath the waters and (b) during the past four years, there has been an unprecedented provision of ships and other munitions for the Navy,, so that we find ourselves remarkably well provided.   The extent of that provision clearly affects the need for additional provision in the Immediate future;(2) The Army Estimates are exceeded by a figure estimated at .  60,000,000.   It may well be that this is accounted for by unforeseen contingencies which have arisen during the past six months, but the magnitude of the figures point to the grave necessity for determining, so far as we can, our Army Policy and the extent of the obligations, which we should incur outside our own territories-.   What size of a standing Army do we need and for what purposes?   The War will certaih-ly prove to be very disappointing in its results, if in&apos;the near future we cannot look&apos; for a substantial reduction in these enormous charges..The questions of policy involved are so important, and not they alone but many others, amongst which the question of the provisioi of subsidies of a direct or indirect kind in aid of different Indus-tries so&quot;.profoundly affect the work and undertakings of the Government in the immediate future that I hope the War Cabinet will be willing [ to institute arrangements for securing methodical and prompt con-sideration of them.(Signed) CADDIS ON.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.. 28.. 7, 19,
