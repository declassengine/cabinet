oinmerxdatIons of the Select Committee on PensionsYM  \ ))      Memorandum by the Minister of Pensions.With reference to my Memorandum G.T.7777 of the22nd instant, I submit the following additional three points on which I ask for an immediate decision;1.     The Select Committee are reserving consideration of pensions for officers and their widows, hut on the analogy of the Cabinet decision in the case of men, I think it is right that the existing War Bonus of 2Qji should be regarded as part of the pension subject to the same possible reduction in accordance with variations in the cost of living as will apply in the case of men&apos;s pensions, provided that the maximum reduction to be made shall not reduce the pension below the present Warrant rates.2.     The Committee lay stress on the desirability of giving disabled officers and men a statutory right to a pension within the terms of any Order in Council or Regulation&apos; governing the conditions of award.     Such a right is already given in regard to Naval Pensions under the Naval Pensions Act of 1865, and I recommend the insertion of a clause in such general terms as will give a legal title to pension without the administrative machinery by which the award is to fete made in the War Pensions Bill which I propose to introduce this Session.3.     I wish to give effect to the recommendations as to Widowsf.Alternative Pension in paragraph 17 of the Committee1s Report.    These are(a) The widow with children who at first goes onthe Plat Rate should have the option to come on the Alternative Pension, if she desires it, as her children work off the Pension Scale. &apos; But she should apply to do so within a limited&apos; time, so that the necessary evidence, may at once be obtained and placed on record.   Later on the evidence might not be available,(b) The widow should be allowed Alternative pension on the basis of two-thirds of her husband&apos;s earnings whether, in fact, he would have been himself entitled to the Alternative Pension or riot.   At present, it is not so.These will require amendments of the Warrantsi and in the case of (a), an administrative direction as to the period within which claims must be made.   I propose that this should be a year from a date to be specified hereafter^(Sgd)   L. Worthington Evans.L.W.E.
