OF AVAILABLE,SHIPPING.\ (presented by Sir Robert Borden to the prime Minister1.   As transportation &quot;between different portions of the British ijnpire must be carried on almost wholly by means of shipping, the control of ocean freight rates and a just dis-position of available shipping in the interests of the whole empire are vitally necessary.2.   Subject to the qualifications hereafter mentioned, there is no such control of rates or satisfactory regulations of the disposition of shipping.3, Whatever control of rates is presently exercised must be regarded as ineffective; and any such control is -wholly under the direction of the British Ministry of Shipping,4.   The disposition and user of.available shipping, is subject to control which has been assumed by the British Ministry of shipping.5.   The Government of Canada is strongly impressed with the view that this condition is not sound; that the policy and methods hitherto pursued have not been characterised in some respects by wise or comprehensive outlook, and that the future relations of the British Empire depend very materially upon the immediate remedy of existing conditions.6,   In its broadest aspects the question thus presented must necessarily demand attentive, and perhaps prolonged, con-sideratian for its permanent solution; but a temporary solution is urgently important, as beyond question the present situation has beaome critical and if uncontrolled it will probably lead to unfortunate and perhaps disastrous results. The following proposals therefore present suggestions, first for a temporary solution, and second, for such consideration of the-problem in its larger aspects as may result in a per-manent solution.7.   Temporary solution:- It is proposed that full power as to the oontrol of ocean rates and as to the disposition and user of British Shipping now available, wherever owned or registered within the Empire, shall be conferred upon a corn-mission on which the United Kingdom shall have two repre-sentatives and each of the Dominions (including India) shall have one representative.   The United Kingdom and each such Dominion shall undertaketo enact such legislation as would give to the orders and regulations formulated by the Commission the force of law in all parts of the Empire.
8.    Permanent proposal:-  Attention is called to Resolution XXI, of the Imperial   ar Conference, 1917, which is as follows:   &quot;Imperial Preference: The time has arrived when all possible encouragement should be given to the Development of Imperial resources, and especially to making the Empire independent of other countries in respect of food supplies, raw materials, and essential industries.    With these objects in view this Conference axpressos it3elf in favour of: fl) The principle ta&amp;t each part of the Empire, having due regard to the inborests of our Allies, shall give specially favourable troatmisnt   and facilities to the produce and manufactures of other parts of the Empire.     (2) Arrange-commitments  by which intending emigrants from tho United Kingdom may be induced to settle in countries under the British j?lagn.The Report of the Royal Commission on Natural Resources presented td the Parliament of the Unitod kingdom, in March, 1913, should-also bo considered in so far ad it relates to the operations of steamship companies carrying passengers and freight between different parts of the Empire,Having regard to the principles upon which the above mentioned resolution of the Imperial &quot;War Conference was based and to the interpretation which was givon to it by the speech of the Prime Minister of the Unitod Kingdom shortly after its passage, it is proposed that a Committee composed of representatives of the Government of the United kingdom and of the Governments of each of the Dominions (including India) should be immediately set up for the purpose of framing a scheme which shall embrace (a) all that is included in the temporary proposals above mentioned, (b) the effective carrying out of the policy upon which-Resolution 2211, above mentioned was based, (c) the establishment of a permanent commission representing isll pares of the Empire, which shall be invested with wide powers relative to transportation, upon the ocean., Such powers should as far as possible be similar or analogous to those which have been conferred in Canada and in other Dominions U)/on permanent commissions charged with the supervision and control of railway and steamship rates and of the nsthods and conditions of operation.
