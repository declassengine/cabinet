It isimpossible to say with certainty whether the harvest of this year will be sufficient to provide this without cutting, down the ex-pected consumption in other parts of. the world, because forecasts, alike of supply and of demand are still largely conjectural.&apos;According to Mr,Hoover&apos;s latest pre-harvest forecast there -is no surplus from which any supply of Grain could be provided for]Russia without other countries going short.   He estimates the im- Iport requirements of all the importing countries as ranging from a i&quot;   &apos;iminimum of lb million to a maximum of 27 million tons. -He&apos;estimates the exportable surplus of all exporting countries as lying between a minimum of 16 million and a maximum of 21 million tons. Southern&apos; Russia is excluded from the calculation on both sides.On this forecast, a deficiency in the world as a whole (apart from Russia) is at least as likely as a surplus and probably more so.   Neither this forecast, however, nor any other that .can be made now has much value.   In one or two cases at least  notably in the case of Australia) the supplies are under-estimated by Mr. Hoover,   At the present moment it is in the American interest to magnify demands and to under-estimate supplies as North America is the principal seller and is committod to&apos;guaranteed prices.   In any case, however, it is clear that an additional demand such as that now put forward, could not, be met except by purchasing grain in North America and forcing the world&apos;s price at least to the North American guaranteed price and probably beyond-it.   This vitally affects the Treasury both in respect of exchange and in respect of the Bread Subsidy.As to the dencnd Uoelf v it may be pointed out that at k&apos;V -&apos;&quot;&apos; &apos; &apos;&apos; -,   present, at any rate, there appears to be no shortage of grainiii/SECRET.
in the Black Sea Ports,    A cablegram (attached)     211 bearing-on this has j..:,st been received from Colons 1 MacAlpine who represents the British Department of the Supreme Economic Council in the Northern Caucasus.     This shows that Wheat is actually being exported from Russia in exchange for clothing aid other necessaries with the consent of Donokin and the Xuban Government.Apart from this telegram, the iPood Controller has no special information enabling him to way whether the demand is justified. Pre-war estimates of the oxport of Corn from southern Russia could bo prepared but would be of little value in the absence of any information as to the state of cultivation at pres-cnt,The demand is certainly a aaipyis&amp;ag-ly laige one.     It assumes that a population of 60,000,000 will be under the charge of Denekin for  ten months l,e. practically from the end of August to the 1920 harvest, and that they will have to receive from outside grain representing the total, ration of 31a5 million persons.   To get this figure of 60,000,000 (in itself half the population of European Russia before the war) it is necessary to reckon in districts so far north as Saratov, Tambov, Voronej, Kursk and Orel, i.e, in effect to assume that Denekla 7/ill forth-with make good the first part of his programme referred to on page 7 of G.T.7785.     The places in which (according to the Communiques published in the Times of July 28th) fighting is now going on (west of Kharkoff and east of Tsaritsin) are of course altogether south of the districts mentioned above.     It seems clear that a commitment of the British Government to a supply of grain based on this 60,000,000 population would be prematuro, and that in any case they cannot be at Donekinfs charges for-as long as ten months6   The total demand probably can therefore bo out down drastically,, even if it is decided to give all possible and necessary help.Tho telegram from Colonel MacAlpino and also&apos; the reference in the &quot;Enclosure to Memorandum&quot; (G.T.7785 ) to the difficulty of inducing owners of grain to part with it in the absence of goodssugge st
212-3-c ministry of .?ood, 28tli July, 1^19,suggest that one of the best ways of helping General Denekin to get grain would be to send him other articles which he could give to the peasants for their grain.

Your 2910, South Russian position. Colonel %oalplne reported about 20th July that relief la unnecessary anywhere In South Russia as many dlstriots possess surplus foodstuffs and prospects ef local oo-ordinal!on distribution supplies Improving existence surplus supplies Is Indicated by fact that American Relief Administration recently loaded steamer Klokapoo with approximately five hundred thousand dollars worth of surplus army stores cloth, hoots, and shoes clothing tools etcetera,   $his cargo is cow being delivered In accordance with joint arrangemenl approved by General Denekln and Kouban Government to Russian Cooperatives at cost price and In exchange for 8000tons wheat now at Novorbssick awaiting transportation to Armenia for relief purposes *  Real relief measure In SouthRussla therefore accomplished and supplies obtained for American relief purposes without any endeavour exploit Southern Russian people.  American iellef Administration suggest similar arrangements should be made by British Government and wheat secured in ?xc en te distributed by relief or military agents in those parts South Kussia where most needed for instance in Bon and Donetx Basin where Governor 6f Ekaterl&amp;oslav and Captain Berry American Military Mission reported on 18th June that workers were short of bread.  American Relief Administration point out that their relief appropriation is entirely expended and they cannot therefore render any further Immediate assistance.   Regarding possible epidemic of Cholera reported by Governor Ekaterinoslav on 18th June Treasury sanction has been obtained at MacAlplnes urgent request on 24tfc July to send one hundred tons Ch3rlde of lime from Army stocks Salonika to South Russian towns and Colonel Pears British Relief Mission Constantinople has been Instructed to arrange shipment00RV1N
