His Document is the Property ofFrom Viceroy, Foreign Department, 30th July 1.919. (Received at India Office 10.30 p.m.)^^Slear the line 11104 S. Secret. Afghanistan. Following from Baluchistan elated 28th July:--&quot;Tribal situation Baluchistan is rapidly passing out of control under combined stress of serious Waziri menace in northern Zhob, incursion of small gangs of Zhob sanad raiders into Loralai district, and seizure of hills north of Hindubagh by hostile tribesmen and militia deserters. In all three quarters mischief is directly due to abstention of our forces from offensive coupled with active support given by Afghans to our tribesmen. It is notorious that officer commanding Afghan forces at Wano has (corrupt group) Wazir (corrupt group) in Zhob and that Zhob tribesmen are being-egged on (corrupt group) and supported by presence of Afghan irregulars either within our territory in neighbourhood of (corrupt group) Fakirzai or assembled close to our borders. It is impossible for our (corrupt group) to chase elusive gangs over mountains and deserts, and equally impossible to trust for defence to irregular bodies of our own tribesmen. Jacob reports about 4,000 Waziris collected at various points to Fort Sandeman and likely to be joined by considerable forces of Abdulla Zais and Sherannis. Eelief column cannot reach Fort Sandeman for some time. Eo action immediately possible can now affect situation round Fort Sandeman unless aeroplanes can be provided, but in rest of Baluchistan whole tribal situation might be altered by withdrawal of Abdul regular and irregular forces to a distance of 20 miles from our frontier between Keshata and (? Fakirzai). From purely military point of view, position and activity of his forces and agents may not now constitute worse tactical or strategical menace than they have been for several weeks, but from political point of view they are daily growing more dangerous. If negotiations are prolonged and Abdul continues his present attitude, Government of India&apos;s hands may be forced by serious events in Baluchistan.&quot;Matter has been referred to Afghan delegates, who state that before their departure from, Kabul Amir had sent Abdul strict injunction to avoid all action calculated to prejudice the negotiations. President has undertaken to hand Grant written warning for delivery to Abdul via Ohaman.
