(THIS D0CU11EMT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYfS GOTONHPNT) .SECRET * G,T. 7843,WAR CABIgT.IMPERIAL -WIRELESS COIOTNICATIOMS.(Memorandum by Lord Milnor),It is a matter of great urgency that a decision be taken upon the question of Imperial Wireless Comnuni-cationi.This was approved in principle by the Government^ years ago, and, under circumstances which Will be re-collected, a Contract was given to the Marconi Company, which owing to differences between the Company and Post Office was never carried out and which the Government ultimately cancelled.Since then the result of the war in this connec-tion has been twofold.   In the first place, it has pre-vented further action being taken for five years; and in the next lt has produced a revolutionary develop-ment in the science of wireless telegraphy.   Results in long-range corimiunlcation regarded as impossible in 1914 are now common practice.Other countries are making rapid progress in such communication,   France has planned and is rapidly carry-ing out a scheme of communication to include her furthest territories; she has a Government Station at Lyons which sends tewa every morning to Shanghai, and will in about,a month be made more powerful still; and by the beginning of next year the French Government&quot;will have completed a station near Bordeaux powerful enough to communicate&apos; with any point on the earthVs surface.The Commonwealth of Australia has decided that Its Imperial Station shall be constructed and owned by the State,It is believed that Canada is ready to share in an Imperial scheme on the same principle.In this country, no step whatever had been taken until a few weeks ago, and then only on a small scale. Yet the peed for cheap and general Imperial telegraphic communication is extreme, and complaint of cable costs and delays is universal.The V/ireless Sub-Committee of the Imperial communicate actions Committee, on which the three fighting services and the chief departments of State are re-preaented, has considered this question and has unanimous-tfmously reported in favour of an Imperial wireless ays-tern constructed, controlled and operated by the State, and as a beginning has recommended the completion, on the Poulsen system, of the Oxford and Cairo Stations, This latter proposal I submitted to the Cabinet on the 24th June 1919; it was duly approved, and is now being carried out by the Post Office,   These two stations will constitute a small but important part of any general Imperial sy3tem.
As the next step, I desire the assent of the Cabinet to my appointing a new Sub-Committee of the Imperial Commu-nications Committee to prepare a complete scheme of Imperial wireless communication&apos;in the lidit of modern wireless science and Imperial needs,   This Committee, which should bo as small as is compatible with a thorough exploration of the subject, would&apos;consist partly of representatives of the Government Departments most directly concerned and partly of the best scientific experts outside the Govern-merit services whose assistance can be secured.The report of this Committee, which it is thought could be ready in about a month, would, if approved by the Cabinet, ssrve as a basis for action.But before asking men with many pressing official and private engagements to undertake the intensive study of this question, I desire, if possible, to secure the approval of. the Cabinet to the principle of a State-con-structed, controlled and operated system of Imperial wireless communication.This principle, as I have already said, has been adopted by the Government in the past, it is understood to embody the views of the Dominion Governments, and it Is the policy of the French and United States Governments, I am confident that, if a good scheme can be worked out on these lines, it would secure the cordial co-operation of the Dominions, but t do not want to approach the D-rdn-ion Governments till I have definite proposals to put before them oh behalf of the British Government.   In this ccnnec-tion I beg to call attention to the memorandum on this subject written by Mr. Hughes just before his departure and now circulated to the Cab$ iet *- G.TC No. 7842.Of course the-Report of thj Committee I propose to set up would hot in any way commit the Cabinet to the adoption of any scheme which the Committee mi^ht propose, or indeed to, anything morj^JgW the serious con-sideration, in the light of the mosijrsbientific knowledge, of the means of meeting the urgent needs of the Empire in respect of wireless communication.30 July 1919.MILNFR.
