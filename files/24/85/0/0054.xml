(P 4383) From Viceroy, 29i/? July 1919.(Received 30th, 11.30 a.ra.)1101/6. Secret. Afghanistan. Your telegram of 26th July. So far,, our -anticipations that arrival of peace delegates would act as a cold douche on tribes has been partly fulfilled ; there lias been distinct lull on Dakka, Khyber and Kurram fronts. On Obitrai front. General Wakil Khan has now received and is acting on peremptory orders from Amir not to aggress. On Baluchistan front there is a lull at Chaman itself, though the Afghan&apos;regular troops are not yet reported to have been withdrawn to prescribed distance. Further north, Afghan efforts to incite tribes meet with some success.   Waziristan remains disturbed and continues to threaten Zhob.Though there is no reason to doubt issue of Amir&apos;s orders to his Generals or of his proclamations to his people (vide my telegram of the 26th July, 1091), it is questionable whether he can now wholly control either. Individual Generals may be tempted to go behind his instructions in order to keep up their own izzal or safeguard themselves against discontent of tribes. Tribes are still excited, and appetite of some of them for raiding whetted by success. As you will have seen from later telegrams, reports of participation of Afghan regulars in raids have not been corroborated by subsequent intelligence, except.in Chitral, where the number who joined in attack on Bumbore is now reduced to 40. Such reports frequently arise from presence of our militia deserters in uniform amongst the raiders.Flouting of armistice terms 0 3cupied prominent place in Grant&apos;s opening address. .. His actual words were as follows: &quot; But do not imagine desire of British Govern-ment for peace in such that they will bear with patience more than they have already borne. You perhaps do not realise how near breaking point had come during.the armistice. I beg you therefore not to trade on the idea that the patience of the British Government is inexhaustible. I warn you that any continuance of intriguing with tribes must make negotiations between us impossible. Believe me as a friend, that, brave though Afghans are, jealous though they are of their independence, there can be only one result if the war is renewed. And the conditions then offered-by British Government would inevitably be very different from the conditions which they are now prepared to offer.&quot; Should any serious breaches of. armistice occur during the negotiation, Grant will be instructed to refer them to peace delegates at once. Should he fail to receive satisfactory explanation or assurance on this or any other vital point, wo propose that he should deliver ultimatum demanding satisfaction On pain of rupture of negotiators. But it is essential that hostilities should be resumed the moment delegates crossed the border ; otherwise their departure would almost certainly be,signal for tribal outburst all along the frontier.We accordingly ask. for your authority to our instructing Grant to act on these lines, if necessary, in the last resort. It is not that we are apprehensive of breakt down of negotiations: we wish, to be fully armed against emergency, and feel, moreover, that success of negotiations may depend. upon our showing our deter* mination to resume hostilities if our demands are not met. Grant&apos;s complete success in first passage of arms (vide my telegram of the 26th July, 1090 S.), seems to indicate strong will-to-peace as the basis of Afghan delegates&apos; instructions. It also suggests that a definite ultimatum may be only way to bring them to their senses.   We solicit very urgent reply.
