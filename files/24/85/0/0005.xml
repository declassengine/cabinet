ProvinooB InoXudod in tho Area.The liboratod country consists of the followingprovincesTho Don Province.Stavropol.Kuban.Terek.Dagheotan.Black sea province.Taurldaand of portiono only of the following provlnceet-Aotrakhan. Ekaterinoelav. Kharkov, Voronezh. Kursk.Of theoo only Kuban and Stavropol aro now said to bo grain producing.   With tho exooption of Aetrakan, Terek, Daghootan and tho Black Soa Province, the remainder wore at one timo grain producing but aro now dovaetatod and are yielding nothing.S.    Estimate of tho population to bo fed in the Area now hold &quot;*&quot;T5g General DoniEtrT.The total population would appear to bo 50,000,000.   Ofthis number, however, tho inhabitants of the non-devaDtatod areas*who, ao will bo oeon, can support themaolvca, numbor 4.500/00O.The number actually requiring relief therefore is only 15t500,000.it3,    Estimated amount of food roquirod.Allpwlng 5 poudo (about 200 lbs) of grain por hoad oftho *..
the population for ten months, thoro would ho required about 80,000,000 pouds of grain (1,500,000 tons), to moot tho demands of tho 15*500,000 referred to In para. $2.    In tho non-devastated aroa, however, Kuban alono normally produces about 300,000,000 poudo per annum.   Clearly, therefore, Kuban alone is perfectly oapable not only of supplying the needs of tho non-devastated area, but also of covering tho remaining deficit.iOf all tho country now hold by Gonoral Donokin or likely to bo held in the near future, the provinces of Kuban with it3 neighbour Stavropol constitute the only two areas whore grain Is now being; produced.4,    Difficulties in tho way of obtaining supplies from North Caucasia.Owing to tho distrust felt by the peasantry towards tho paper money available as currency in Southern Russia, groat difficulty is exporiencod in inducing them to yield up their stores of grain and bread and the only satlcfactory proposal hitherto advanced appears to consist uomowhat as followst   That manufactured goods urgently required by the grain producing pro- . vinces should bo offered in exchange for the grain required.    By this means it is bolioved that tho peasants will readily part with their stores.   So far as the evidence shows there is no immediate prospect of this system of barter being introduced Into North &quot;Cauoasia owing to the difficulty of importing manufactured goods in bulk from weetorn Europe into that area.It would appear, therefore, that on the assumption that the grain producing provinces are self-supporting, a maximum of 80,000,000 pouds are required to oover the needs of tho population on tho devastated area for a period of ten months.In regard to the above, it should bo noted that there is a possibility of obtaining, without the system of barter   air&amp;&amp;y
already outlined, about 10   -   15,000,000 poudo of grain from Kuban,   As this,&quot; hov/ovor, Id problematic, it hao not boon takon into account in ootimating the raaxinum amount of grain required to be imported for General Donikin&apos;o noedo.II, I. 6. 130366, July 26th, 1919.
