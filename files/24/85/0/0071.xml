fl^RHLeS la the Hropferty of 1 i&quot;  ^ - *;3 8 7^TTtSir August, 1919 VGOvUHNMBNT CARS   POR OPPICIAL USE,morandum for the War Cabinet by the Pirst Lord of the Admiralty.I entirely appreciate the strength of feeling in regard to Government motor-cars,   I am, however,      firmly convinced from my own personal experience, first at the Colonial Office, and then here, that in the altered conditioniotnthings following upon the war, cars are absolutely essential to Ministers and high officials, if they are adequately to discharge their duties; anf I certainly would not attempt my task without a car.   So if it is decided to give them up, I shall provide my own - and I frankly admit that I have no sort of grievance. It is really a matter of public service, on the one hand, and public opinion on the other; and if the latter condemns the supply of cars gratis to Ministers and others, it is quite clear to my mind that they must be given up.I venture to suggest, however, that if this be the decision, an arrangement should be made by which a certain number of cars now in the possession of Government Departments, should be retained and should be let to Ministers and others in Government Departments on payment of a sum calculated to meet wear and tear, and a reasonable payment for the car - petrol to be paid for according to consumption.        There is no difficulty in this: it would give . Ministers the advantage of cars on rather cheaper terms than they could get them from public sources, and would not cost the State a farthing if the payments are properly calculated.   There is also one other advantage in this plan which I think it is difficult to exaggerate,, namely, the control of the drivers by a Government Department. If Ministers have to get their own chauffeurs and cars, they wi^l be exposed to a great many difficulties, owing to the fact that it is very often extremely hard to find a man who is a thoroughly competent driver and reliable in all other respects; and the trouble to which Ministers would be liable in dealing with their own private drivers might easily be considerable - whereas if they were under a Government official, the matter is quite easily dealt with, and I think such control would be more effective.I further suggest that all drivers should bs civilian^; and I think it would be an advantage if they had a livery of a distinguishing colour, as this is of great assistance to the police when cars have to be let through the lines. It would be impossible even for the Prime Minister to keep hi3 engagements on days when there are crowds in London, if it were not that he is able to be passed through; and though his car and chauffeur may soon become known to the police, it cannot be expected that this will happen to all the cars and drivers belonging to different members of the Government - whereas if they were a distinguishing dress or badge of some kind, it would be an easy matter for the police.I suggest this plan for consideration as an . alternative.(Signed) W.H. LOKG.1.8.19.
