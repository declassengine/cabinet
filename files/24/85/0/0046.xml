K(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY Off HIS, BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT) ,*SECRET,- V/AR CABINET.g.T&apos;. 7846,   , .   &apos; -*:    &quot; ,,&apos;I d ARMIES AND ECONOMICS./ ^ BEINGREFLgCIONS OH SOME ASPECTSOF THE&apos; ALLIED SITUATION ON JULY 27th; 1919.Memorandum for the War &apos;Cabinet Joy,Mr. Balfour.It must bo obvious to everyone who has followed contemporary developments that Allied diplomacy is being seriously embarrassed by Allied military weakness.   Ever since Peace with Germany seemed in a fair way to be estab-lished, it has been a race between the Great Powers wltich should demobilise the fastest.   Italy, indeed, for reasons (x) of her own, has lagged behind her Allies.   But this makesConfer-   little difference since, according to Signer Tittoni-(x), ence of   her Government no longer dares to send troops beyond her July 26, own frontiers for fear of revolution!I am not concerned here to justify this procedure. It has the best of all justification;; - it is inevitable. But I must say a word about Its consequences, for these have to be faced.We have at present two kinds of Military obliga-tioiii.; the one imposed by Treaty, the other by policy. Neither of these should seem very formidable to the States which only a few months ago had, I suppose, some fifteen million men under arms.. But so rapidly have our Armies melted away that both are burdensome, and both lead to unedifying recrimination in the Conference Room about the share which the different Allies are taking in the common burden.   Upper Silesia, for example, has. by Treaty to be    u occupied till a plebiscite be held.   The soldiers say, or did say, that a division was required for the purpose. Where is it to come from, and how is it to be composed ? It is to come, say the soldiers, from the Army of Occupa-tion on the Rhine.   It is to be composed, says H, Clemenceau, of Allied troops in equal proportion.   The discussion is not yet concluded, but&apos;I conjecture that in the end this arrange-ment will prove inconvenient or impracticablej that if a division be really required, it will hqvC in the1 main to be * French, and that if so, M, Clemenceau will louoly complain Of the hardship thus inflicted upon his country, (/$his is precisely what he is doing with regard to the occupation of Bulgaria and the control of Hungary,   &quot;What is Bulgaria to me ?&quot; he exclaims.   &quot;Why should France keep troops to further the interests of Greece ?   :.&apos;hy should Prance, and, among the Great Powers, France alone, risk two divisions in compelling Hungary to obey the Armistice ?   This is equally the duty of Britain and America and Italy,   But there are apparently no British or American troops to sendj and though there are Italian troops, Italy dare not send them.   w&quot;hat is he to say to the French &apos;rChambre1 ?   now is-he to justify himself to the French People ?&quot; - and so on.
The se little controversies - are harmful, but doubtless they can be arranged.     Indeed, if I could . only find out exactly what are our own Military commitments and our own Military resources, I should not despair of coming to some clear understanding, at least between France and ourselves...   But there is another aspect of the problem not so easily dealt with, the aspect which relate&quot; to our small Allies and our small enemies..   The&apos;.former;.. one would, suppose; would obey us through gratitude; the latter through fear. But the gratitude if! being rapidly worn avray by our persistent efforts to prevent the nations we have saved or created from cutting each other&apos;n -throats and seizing-each-other1a territory; while the fear cannot easily survive the continued spectacle of our0 obvious Military weakness..   Greeks,. Roumanians, Poles. Czechs,. (?) Jugo-Siava,,(I say nothing of the Italians), have all at different times:disobeyed our explicit instructions.     The Hungarians at the present moment-are breaking the Armistice with impunity.     The vases-are many in vrhich a Division or Brigade or even a Battalion would have made a situation easy which is now difficult, and have effectually smoothed the diplomatic path to Peace.    But asking the War Depart-ment of a Great Power for soldiers is li&amp;a asking a mendicant for a thousand pounds, and you get much the same reply.     The Conference is therefore compelled to talk when action is required.    $ven the threat of action is denied us; for so notorious is our impotence that we cannot afford to bluff.I assume that this disease is incurable. In the absence of any full and authentic information on the Military situation I Cannot do otherwise.     But if we have no soldiers wherewith to help and shepherd our friends, or control and perhaps coerce our foes, have we any substitute? I know of none but the econ-omic weapon.    But the economic weapon is unfortunately not very oa*y to use; and, except in the crude form of blockade,; has not, so far as I know, been system-atically employed on a large scale as an engine of diplomatic persuasion.    I plead for a closer study cf its capabilities.I admit the fliffdcultiea in the way of its employment are manifold.    In the first place, it necessarily consists in withholding, or threatening to withhold, something which would otherwise be given&apos;- ^ and the Allies, except America, are so impoverished that they have very little to give; whils America, even if a willing helper, is hampered at every turn by her Constitution.    Still it is clear that in the economic reconstruction of Europe, Britain, poor though she may be, is going to play a leading part; and President Wilson, though he cannot give money, can&apos; apparently give food.    But here oomes in the second difficulty, which is apt to impede the use of the economic weapon.     It often inflicts direct and obvious injury on women and children; and it often produces some injurious economic reaction on the Powers that use it.    Philanthropy boggles at the first consequence; self-interest at the second.    But I do not think these objections are necessarily fatal..    Of course no universal principles jan be laid down..    Each case must be considered on its merits; and with regard
to overy country where we are likely to have trouble^ we ought to examine how, by exciting economic hopes or fears, we can successfully act upon its rulorso&apos; 1&apos;ihere the results of such an examination are satisfaction^ factory we may be well content to lack Military foroaj though even at the best we cannot hope that the remote threats of ecomonio ills will always give pause to   &apos; greedy Governments or poppies intoxicated with a per** verted patriotism?,    The^e are many nations at this moment who understand no. argument but force;   and on them the sight of a British Battalion would have a more immediate effect than the remoter prospects of poverty and want.    I greatly fear that the inevitable tragedies of the coming winter may change the current of their thoughts.    In what direction,1 cannot tell. But surely they will think less of .7ar. .(Intd) A.J.B
