G.T, 7824.WAR CABINET,TriE S,ALS TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES. OF TEMPORARY HUTSAFP HOSTELS,(Note by the Chancellor of the exchequer*)I circulate to my colleagues a report of conferences held rn the point referred to in paragraph 5 of my memorandum of the 15th instant (G.T. 7707).29th July, 1919(initialled)   A,C.REPORT OF C01i&apos;F?lR?rCE.Tv/o Conferences have been held, on Hbnday, July 21 st and Tuesday, July 22nd, with reference to the fifth paragraph in the Memorandum (paper No. G.T. 7707 annexed) on &quot;Government-owned Houses&quot;, submitted by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on July 15th to the War cabinet.   The paragraph in question runs as follows&quot;(5) that the terns on which temporary huts are to be sold should be reconsidered by the Treasury, Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Munitions in co-operation - the object being to find a fair price at which they can be offered and used by the Local Authorities to help in solving the existing housing problem.   It was agreed that the price for this purpose would have to be less than the prices now secured by the Disposal Board for individual sales,&quot;The following officers attendea one or both of the ConferencesM-r.

(Ministry of Munitions)(Disposal Board (Ministry of Munitions)(Hostel Management Department) (Ministry of Munitions. )The paragraph referred to above in the Chancellor of the &quot;Exchequer&apos;s Memorandum was limited in its application to y      &quot;Temporary Huts&quot;.   At the Second Conference on July 22nd, it was thought desirable to consider also the case of the Hostels under the control of the Ministry of Munitions, as the dis-posal of these Hostels raised questions in s*any respects similar to those connected with the disposal of &quot;Temporary Huts&quot;-.
i.   mmma huts.The officers of the Disposal Board stated that from the point of view of conversion into temporary houses, by far the most convenient typo of hut was the sectional Hut of ..dimensions 60. ft. x 15 ft.&apos;    Of these there were between 400 and 500 nev ones which had never been erected, available for disposal in Contractors Works, and approximately .3,000 second-hand ones erected in various part,&apos;-., of the country.     The market for the new huts was very good, at about  200 each, and there v/as a considerable demand for second-hand huts, in good eondition..    Considerable numbers had already been sold to Local Authorities,The. disposal Joard vere not holding up the sale of &apos; these huts but vie re placing them on the market as and when they ;ere notified by the   ar Office as. available for disposal, nor did the disposal Board determine their valuation on&apos; the basis of a few exceptional offers.     It was quite impossible to state the total number of huts which were likely eventually jto be available.for disposal.     This depended entirely on the VJar Office policy as to the retention of camps.     Nor tfas it pos; ible to make any estimate of their probable market price in the future, nor &apos;of the margin (if any) of huts which might ultimately&apos;have, to be scrapped.     ;.-.ll Local authorities were informed of impending &quot;sales.     The 60 ft.x 15 ft. hut cost on an average  285; they were originally offered for sale at  250.     The present price at which there is a ready sale is about  200.     An offer to sell a number of these new huts ay  17.5 had been made to the Hammersmith Council and rejected by them.:The Conference agreed that a reduction in the price of. Huts to Local Authorities might&apos; to some extent turn the scale in favour of huts, as opposed to bricks and mortar,&apos; though regarding the Housing problem as-a i*at iOnal&apos; so heme, it was doubtful whether in the end it would be cheaper to convert huts into temporary dwellings.     iheir life might be so short that the, annual expenditure in respect of linking *und, Interest and Maintenance, might be greater than in the case of solidly constructed buildings.     Moreover, they could not be accepted as a permanent solution to-the housing question, and it was quite likely that serious complaints would be made of them after a few years,   . On the other hand, th* use of huts was very desir-able on the ground ofspped.     It would at least enable a man to get a roof over hiohead without delay.    Further, the defer-rnont of the building kf a certain number of houses might enable-Local authorities to provide them a few years hence at a-lower cost than was possible at the present inflated prices. -The representatives of the Kdnistry of Health argued that the market for the,-,o huts was falling: that if the price of a hut were  200 to-day, it might be  100 in six months&apos; time and might&apos; continue to fall till, if tho : ar Office threw up a large number C^r disposal, the Government might eventually have to sell&apos; them a^ scrap value&apos;.     If a considerable number of huts had eventually to be scrapped, there might be considerable public dissatisfaction that their utilization had been discouraged by an insistence upon the full market price obtainable on a policy of limited sales, Moreover, the proposed arrangement consitituted&apos;a kind of wholesale purchase on behalf of housing authorities generally, aid in this respect justified a considerable abatement of -prices.     As against
this,- it was urged that it was impos,iblo to predict future prices.     ievi huts woud&apos;1 certainly have a ready uale and probably Iso all second-hand huts in good condition:   Local authorities buying in July 1919 ought to pay the price of that date and aB spoed was the osaence of the proposal it v,as reasonable to charge more for immediate delivery.The Conference considered whether it was possible to draw up a schedule of fixed prices for Local authorities. -It was explained that while it might be possible to fix a price for new huts, the Boound^hand huts were in varying stages of depreciation and their value depended largely on thOir actual situation.-   The question was not so much the value of the hut, as the value of the hut in a particular) place.      This ren&amp;ered&quot;T;ne iTea of&apos; fixed pricesfailing the possibility of fixing a definite price for Local  Authorities, the Conference decided that the best method of carrying out the Cabinet policy, would bo to have a valuation and to allow Local authorities a percentage discount.   . Tho Conference wore unanimously and strongly averse from the principle of concealed subsidies, and some discussion took place as to whether the cost of this discount ought really to be regardedcas a ntfcsidy at $til 0     The representatives of tho Ministry of Health argued that a considerable discount could be allowed on purely commercial lines for a purchase of huts in bulk, and in view of the certainty of a falling market.Assuming that the cost of the discount was to bo regarded as a stibsicuy Mr. Ifeylan, the finance Member of the Disposal Board,, said that he would be satisfied if tho Disposal Board took credit for the amount in a foot note to their a coun s* Mr.. Wilkins$ the treasury representative, thought that a corresponding debit should be set up in tho Housing Accounts, so as to whow the true loss on Housing,&apos;and that actual cash should pass betwoon the Departments,,    He pointed out, however, that objection might be taken to this arrangement on the ground that it involved the supplementing of the statutory subsidy by a second method of subsidising housing authorities.    He also observed that tho precedent of a discount might spread.,   The Disposal Board might be asked to aall huts below market price to other persons or bodies.    Alternatively, the Ministry of Health might be asked to give a discount not only on huts but also on bricks and mortar - a demand which had already been made and refused.    And, finally he thought it should bo reoognised that (except in a few cases where tho produce of the penny rate was large) the discount was merely from one pocket Of the taxpayer to the other.The Conference decided to put forward the following recommendations(1)    That the wishes of the Cabinet should bo carried out by means of a discount.(3)    That the amount of this discount was entirely a &quot;matter of policy, -tat that an arbitrary figure of 25$ might perhaps be taken. -

The Sheffield City Council have done this without waiting to obtain possession of the property, acting apparently on the assumption that the Hostels would eventually be acquired by them on some terms or other.   It is understood that the Coventry Town Council are also anxfious to take over the Hostels in their area if they could be obtained on favourable terms, though no actual negotiations to this end have yet been opened.The Conference discussed at so&apos;ie length the terms on which local authorities midat acquire Hostels in their areas-.   It was pointed out that in some respects local authorities were in a strong position, as in many cases they were the only prospective pur-chasers..   On the other hand enquiries with regard to individual Hostels had been received from private firms and it could not be assumed that the hands of the Disposal Board were entirely tied in the matter. The cost of conversion into private dwellings was comparatively low.   It was stated that the Sheffield Council had been able to carry out the between  90 -  100 per single dwelling, even 6/- a week would represent a hifrh capital expenditure, and it was argued of the Disposal Board that the Hostels considerable value to the local authorities merely as a temporary relief to their housing difficulties and that they should pay a reasonable price, for them and not expect to  ,et them practically for nothing.   It was also pointed out that roads had been made, drainage and heating systems installed and li,^it and water laid on.   All these services were of definite value to the local authorities and shoul- be paid for accordingly.After some discussion the Conference deciued that the arrangement of a valuation - subject to aconversion at , , A rent of return on this by the Officers would be of ;
discount v/as less applicable to the case of ho-stels than to that of temporary huts.   Any valuation that mif&quot;ht be made would necessarily be an estimate of the value to the local authority concerned and It would be difficult to obtain a valuation to which the discount of 25 per cent could properly be applied0It was finally deoiOeii to recommend j-(1)   that the Officers of the Disposal Board should enter into immediate negotiations -with the Sheffield and Coventry authorities, as.between a willing seller and a willing purchaser,, for the sale of the Hostels in their areas,(2)   that should the negotiations show that there was no possibility if an agreement with regard to price., the Disposal Board should imme-dlately. report the facts to the Minister of Munitions and to the Minister of Health.
