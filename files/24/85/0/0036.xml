(P 4329) From Viceroy, 21th July 1919.(Received 28th; 11.20 a.m.)1093 S.  Secret.  Afghanistan.   Following from Grant: &quot; After presentation and some complimentary talk I read my address to Afghan delegation in English.   Mania Basksh then read Persian translation and handed copies to Afghan delegation.   Ali Ahmad then made a lengthy speech in reply.   He made no attempt to excuse what Afghans had done, but he entered into vague theoretical and general reasons accounting for war, insinuating perhaps that recent legislation in India had aroused sympathy in Afghanistan for Indians, and tended to bring-about war.   He said that friendship-was necessary between the two countries, but that Afghanistan^ friendship was more important to us tban&quot;our friendship was to them.   He twice mentioned obligations Afghanistan had placed us under during past five years by not taking sides against us, and he said they had received no return as yet for this assistance.   In reply to my remarks about the Amir&apos;s suing for peace, he stated that first overtures for peace had come from our side, being the message sent by Foreign Secretary to the Amir through Abdur Rahman, the Afghan Envoy.   Peace between us was very necessary and tbe delegates had obviously specially been selected on both sides as persons likely to effect this consummation. He drew a parallel between our war with Germany and the present Afghan war Avitk us.   Germany was better organised and better equipped, but ultimately by raising our whole nation and presenting a united front we had defeated them.   Afghanistan might do the same as that with our superior resources.   He said that he had no extraordinary request to make from us and none that we would find ourselves unable to comply with; but he gave no indication at all what the requests were likely to be. Once or twice he mentioned awakening national sentiment all over the world and the growth of national requirements and desires, and said that Afghanistan, in common with the rest of the world, would insist on securing these.   He (two corrupt groups) Bolshevism which had ruined Russia, and indicated how disastrous it might be for Afghanistan and India if it were (corrupt group, ? to) penetrate via Afghanistan to India.   In this matter he said Afghanistan could give us -great assistance against Bolshevism, where it is, especially in Trans-caspia;   He pointed out we had a considerable number of Mohamedan subjects, and our acts affected Mohamedans all over the world.   He said, speaking as a friend, that we had made a mistake breaking friendship with Turkey, and this had resulted in our having deprived Mohamednns of many of their holy places which we now occupied, citing Baghdad, Kirbela, Nejef. Jerusalem, &amp;c.     -  -&quot; Whole speech was confessed attempt to present Afghan case as strongly- as possible, and was not intended, 1 think, to be offensive. It Avas agreed Afghan delegates should&apos; give a further written reply to other points in my address to-morrow.&quot;After this I asked if Ali Ahmad would like privately to discuss with me the restrictions placed upon them here. He said he would prefer to discuss them in the presence of his colleagues. His main desire was to be allowed to take about a personal retinue of armed men when he went out.. I pointed out the difficulties and the discussion became somewhat heated. But Ali Ahmad cooled when I informed him what we required was bis co-operation in carrying out a perfectly reasonable arrangement. I think we can arrange a reasonable compromise in this matter. I then asked him about the British Agent who, he said, was safe and well in his own house at Kabul, with a guard to protect him against the Afghans. But he then made the preposterous suggestion that Ave should exchange late Afghan Postmaster Ghulam Haidar Khan for our British Agent. I clinched this suggestion Avith some warmth and asked if British Agent was being kept as a hostage. This Ali Ahmad, though very heated, denied. He promised to forward at once a letter from myself to British envoy and evidently felt that they were ou dangerous ground.- &quot; My general conclusion is that Afghans are anxious for peace, but Ali Ahmad is a vain, hot-tempered, blustering, florid, man, whose temper may make him at any moment&apos;impossible. It is difficult to predict more than this at present stage. If I am to make anything of him, I must be in a position to give him a definite ultimatum at any moment, and this I propose to do if necessary. I practically did it this morning Avith excellent effect.&quot;
