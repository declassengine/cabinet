This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.WAR CABINET.TRADE WITH SOUTH RUSSIA.^   MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate a Memorandum which the Chief of the Department for Trade and Industry, attached to the General Headquarters of the Forces in South Russia, addressed to General Briggs, Chief of the British Military Mission.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.. 29th July, 1919.(No. 422.) . 28th May, 1919.With reference to our conversation, I consider it my duty to inform you that, simultaneously with the help given by Great Britain as regards military equipment, assistance is imperatively needed in the matter of re-establishing trade, which has been entirely destroyed by the revolution and the Bolsheviks.If it is considered of such importance to supply the Volunteer Army with military equipment during its advance, it is equally important to assist Russia in economic aftairs, both when the Army advances into the starving governments relieved from Bolshevik oppression as well as when re-establishing order and normal life.The spreading of the ideas of the Volunteer Army will meet with still greater success if the victoriously advancing troops not only establish order but bring a quantity of the necessary food supplies. Even the rumour that the Volunteer Army was bringing in its.wake food and articles of primary necessity must have a magic effect on the hungry population of the districts under Bolshevik occupation and on the wavering ranks of the Red Army.The actual appearance of foreign goods on the market, even at high but not exorbitant prices, will be more effective than any propaganda, and will cause the long-suffering population to enlist in the ranks of the Volunteer Army and that of its Allies.On the contrary, if the Volunteer Army enters a new territory, where there are many towns, without being able to.give the inhabitants some measure of the former plenty in food and goods, there will be no possibility of firmly establishing absolute order.The enemies of the Volunteer Army and of its Allies, in pointing out the unrealized hopes of the starving inhabitants, who were promised supplies, will have great ease in persuading the discontented people to join their ranks. Provisions in the form of grain and fats will follow the Volunteer Army from South Russia in so far as possible, but it will be quite impossible to obtain the following articles without the help of the Allies in purchasing them abroad : tea (the national beverage), sugar, rice, &amp;c, and other articles in common use, such as boots, cotton material, cigarette papers, &amp;c.The exchange of goods which is being established with such difficulty cannot develop without effective aid on the part of the Allies.There can hardly be any hope of speedily regulating the supply of a&apos; sufficient quantity of goods to the ports for the purpose of establishing goods exchange, as the front is still too near, the disorganization of transport is too great, trade has sustained too severe a shock and local industry has been almost destroyed. &apos;Should the state of the money market be taken into consideration, which is devoid of capital, ready money and foreign currency, if will become quite clear that the hopes of the allied merchants of receiving goods from Russia in exchange for local products cannot be realized.Although Russia is the country most interested in receiving goods, she is not in a position to commence goods exchange herself. Besides the fact that there is no tonnage and no possibility of despatching the goods to the ports, there are no government or public enterprises, no large firms or banks, which could undertake the work of collecting goods, because it is impossible to purchase anything from the inhabitants for Russian currency.Any amount of different raw materials can be obtained in exchange for foreign goods. It is impossible, however, to buy foreign goods to commence goods exchange, owing to the absence of foreign currency.Only the possession of a sufficient amount of foreign currency or foreign goods can help to establish goods exchange at the present moment. Goods exchange will rapidly develop after the first impetus has been given.&apos; (19/347)  70 7/19 H&amp;S  7357wo
\Those Allied countries, which have suffered little through the war and its consequences, and which are economically much stronger, must be the first to come to Eussia&apos;s aid. The Allies must take the the first steps and despatch goods, which will be exchanged for local raw materials. By doing this the Allies will prove to the population that they are ready to give Russia effective help in every possible way. After they have taken the first step towards re-establishing trade and industry, they will easily and deservedly secure a large market for their exports.The country which will first send goods and distribute them among the population will for many years have the priority both in import and export.&apos; The commercial and industrial circles of the Allied countries, however, are badly informed with regard to the actual economic and political situation in Russia, and cannot with sufficient certitude show any initiative themselves.Rumours as to the undecided political situation, the fear of taking risks, false reports spread by the hostile camp of profiteers and Bolsheviks with regard to the difficulties and obstacles which will be met with in the establishment of goods exchange,, greatly impede the speedy establishment of the latter by the merchants and owners of enterprises.   The Government must give its assistance and guarantee the first steps.Help must be quick and effective.&apos; Without deciding beforehand the details and the manner in which help could be rendered, the British Government or British banks might open a credit oj 2 3 million pounds for the purchase of goods in England.The goods purchased in England would be despatched to Novorossisk, and in order to avoid any profiteering, addressed to the Trade and Industrial Department attached to General Headquarters of forces in South Russia. The Department of Trade and Industry would undertake tbe distribution of the goods.among the different provinces and nationalities, and indicate what goods and what quantities are required.In order to effect the choice and nurchase of the above goods abroad, and to establish stable commercial relations, it is necessary to facilitate as far as possible conditions of travel for commercial agents of the Department for Trade and Industry, and of persons authorised by the department to execute some commercial transaction and to give permits to merchants, representatives of business firms and trade and industrial organizations. It would be desirable if the granting of vises for travel abroad could be facilitated, because the present procedure in Yekaterinodar entails considerable difficulties.Priority must be given to the purchase of goods of primary necessity, which are used by the majority of the population. According to information&apos; to hand, British authorities are already sending goods on the lines indicated above to the local populations on the Northern Archangel Murman front.The goods will be sold for Russian roubles at cost price.The Russian roubles realized by the sale of the goods, will be deposited in banks in the name of the British Government or groups of British banks, where credit has been opened. The money thus realized can be used by the British Government, either for the purchase in Russia of a certain amount of goods, which England finds necessary to import into England, or will keep these roubles until Great Russia has been re-established, when it will be possible to obtain the original value of the rouble.Chief of Department,V. LEBEDEV.
