JL *-^Military Secret,This&apos; Document is the Prop^-tv of 1025&quot;From Secretary of Slate to Viceroy, Army Department, 1st August 1939.2980. Your 1104 1)., Foreign Department, Afghanistan, dated 30th July Reference Baluchistan report of 2St!i. As long ago as 7th June it was evident that serious trouble was developing in Zhob, and Sandeman was attacked on 12th June. Early in July a column of our troops was attacked near&apos; Kapip, and on 14-th we suffered a serious reverse near same place. Since 19th July communications have been interrupted with Fort Sandeman. As there is a Division and two Cavalry Brigades at Quetta it is not understood why our forces have apparently abstained from any offensive operations ; also, why relief column cannot reach Fort Sandeman for some time, which-statement seems unsatisfactorily vague. Are you sure that military operations in Baluchistan are being directed with energy and enterprise? The report under reference causes me serious misgivings oh the subject, and I shall be glad to hear more fully from you. Please inform me, at same time, why earlier arrangements were not made to relieve situation at Fort Sandeman.r &amp;
