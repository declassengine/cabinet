The Memorandum sets forth the grounds upon which it is claimed that legal effect should be given to the desire of Sir Hugh Lane,The views of the Trustees of the National Gallery in London, who at.present have possession of the pictures, are stated in the penultimate paragraph of the Memorandum.My predecessors, Mr, Puke, and the present Home-Secretary, were strongly pressed to introduce a special Bill, and the agitation in favour of this course has been renewed.     All parties in Ireland, without distinction, have been insisting upon thio course.I ask for a decision from the Cabinet as to whether a special Bill should be introduced.(Initialled)I, M.Chief Secretary&apos;s Office, lublin Castle,28th July, 1919.

His enthusiasm had roused others to help, and, he himself having given many fine pictures&quot;, some owners, artists and great -Jipyof friends did the same&apos;   the present King and t^ueen were aihohg the donors; Mr.Roo.sevelt, then President, was a subscriber; Mrs,Wattsj after her husband&apos;s death, carried out his un-attested wish to give one of his own paintings to Ireland. The Dublin Corporation provided a fine old house to be used as a Gallery for the time being; a Gallery was; to be built later, but difficulties as to a Site were in the way. Then failing solid ground) it was proposed to build a bridge over the Liffey in the Florentine fashion.   Mr. Lutyene made plans, for this Bridge Gallery, so beautiful that many became enthusiasticj and the most enthusiastic was Hugh Lane.He set his heart on it, but objections were made,seme reasonable, some frivolous and discourteous both to him and to the Architect.   Somo newspapers were more than discour-teous, a majority of the Corporation rejected the plan in the same fashion.   And Lane, angry and disheartened, took away the group of pictures named in the Appendix, which he had offered as a conditional-gift&apos;, and sent them to the London National Gallery for exhibition.   Immediately after-wards, October 1913, still resentful, he made his Will. In it he says, &quot;I bequeath my Sargent portrait, the Modem

But his anger soon passed away,- and though he had arranged to have the pictures shown in London, his pre-eccupation with Ireland made him hold to the hope of bringing hack to the Dublin Gallery the pictures he had collected as, in his own words,&quot;complementary to those already there&quot;.   In March 1914 he was appointed Director of the National.Gallery ^f Ireland.   It was there, on 3rd.February 1915, that he wrote the- Codicil of wluch a. copy is attached, that is illegal only because his signature is not witnessed, and that would be legal as it is, xn Scotland or in the trendhes It is in his own handwriting and signed by him; a correct tion in the date Is initialled by hxmj he sealed and locked it in his desk at the National Gallery, addressed to his Sister, Mrs. Shine, in whose keeping he had left, his Fill.

1918, at which the Government was called upon to take steps to ensure the restitution of these pictures.

As to the five years limit for providing a Gallery, the alternative legatees, the Trustees of the Dublin National Gallery, are satisfied that the delay in fulfilling this condition is justified by circumstances connected with the War, and will not ? should the Codicil be legalised, as they hope, make any claim to the pictures on this account.

The Dublin Corporation re-affirms its decision to provide a Gallery.

Meanwhile on September 2, 1918, at a meeting of the Dublin Corporation, the following resolution was unanimously pessed,

"That thi? Council re-affirms its previous decision to provide a Gallery for the Hugh Lane pictures, provided they were obtained for the City of Dublin". The previous decision referred to was adopted at a special Meeting of Corporation on January 20th, 1913, and was as follows:-

Terms of the previous decision.

"That the Council, believing that the overwhelming majority of the Citizens is in favour of the erection of a Municipal Art Gallery for the purpose of housing the magnificent collection of pictures kindly given upon certain conditions by Sir Hugh Lane and others, hereby agrees to apply the sum of £22,000 being ¼d. in the £  of the Library Rate, capitalised, in the erection of such Municipal Art Gallery provided that the Citizens Provisional Committee present to the Municipality free of cost such a site for the erection of such building, and a further sum estimated at £3,000 to be used in addition to the £22,000 for the erection of such Gallery."

p0: (I)SIR HUGH LANE&apos;S FRENCH PICTURESLONDONPRINTED AT THE CHISWICK PRESS1917
SIR HUGH LANE&apos;S FRENCH PICTURES
SIR HUGH LANE&apos;S FRENCH PICTURESABILL is about to be laid before Parliament to make legal a Codicil written by the late Sir Hugh Lane shortly before his tragic death in the Lusitania disaster on 7 May 1915.I am the Trustee named in the Codicil and so feel I have a right to speak.Hugh Lane, an expert in art, having made some money by buying and selling pictures by Old Masters, founded when only 28 a Gallery in Dublin contain-ing work by living and modern Masters. Ireland had already a National Gallery on the same lines as that of London, showing the works of past genera-tions, but in Dublin there were no modern pictures of merit in any public collection, students had to go out of their country to see what would best help their own work, what had been done near their own time. He, with his vehement enthusiasm, roused others to help, he himself giving many fine pictures. Others, owners and artists and groups of friends, did the same; the present King and Queen were among the donors; Mr. Roosevelt, then Pre-sident, was a subscriber; Mrs. Watts, after her hus-band&apos;s death, carried out his unattested wish to give one of his own paintings to Ireland. The Dublin Corporation provided a fine old house to be used as a Gallery for the time being; a Gallery was to be
built later, but difficulties as to a site were in the way  one in St. Stephen&apos;s Green which Hugh Lane had hoped for was refused; of those proposed, some were too costly, some too cramped or too much out of the way. Then, failing solid ground, it was proposed to build a bridge over the Liffey to serve as a founda-tion in the Florentine fashion. Mr. Lutyens made plans for this Bridge Gallery, so beautiful that many became enthusiastic, and the most enthusiastic was Hugh Lane. He set his heart on it, but objec-tions were made, some reasonable, some frivolous and discourteous both to him and to the architect. Some newspapers were more than discourteous, a majority of the Corporation rejected the plan in the same fashion. And Hugh Lane, angry and disheart-ened, took away the conditional gift he had offered and exhibited the group of pictures named on pages 17 and 18 of this pamphlet, and which he had described as *- Complementary to those already in the Gallery.&quot; Im-mediately afterwards, Oft. 11-13, still resentful, he \tf made a will, his last, which is now being carried out; in it he says,&quot; [ bequeath my Sargent portrait, the Modern Pictures now being shown in Belfast and any Modern Pictures of merit (John Drawings, etc.), that I possess to the Dublin Gallery of Modern Art, other than the group of pictures lent by me to the London National Gallery, which I bequeath to found a Collection of Modern Continental Art in London.&quot; But his anger soon passed away, and though he arranged to have the pictures shown in London, we know from his own lips that his preoccupation with Ireland made him hold to the hope of bringing back to the Dublin Gallery the pictures he had collected as complementary to those already there. In March 1914 he was ap-pointed Director of the National Gallery of Ireland. It was there, on 3 February 1915, that he wrote the
Codicil that is illegal only because his signature is not witnessed, and that would be legal as it is, in Scotland or in the trenches. It is in his own handwriting and signed by him; he locked it in his desk at the National Gallery, addressed to his sister, Mrs. Shine. He says, &quot;This is a Codicil to my last Will to the effect that the group of pictures now at the National Gallery London, which I had bequeathed to that Institution, I now bequeath to the City of Dublin, providing that a suitable building is provided for them within five years of my death. The group of pictures I lent to Belfast, I give to the Modern Gallery in Harcourt Street. If a building is provided within five years, the whole collection will be housed together. The sole Trustee in this question is to be my Aunt, Lady Gregory. She is to appoint any additional Trustees she may think fit. I also wish that the pictures now on loan at this (National Gallery of Ireland) Gallery remain as my gift.&quot; If within five years a Gallery is not forthcoming, then the group of pictures at the N. G. London is to be sold and the proceeds go to fulfil the purpose of my Will. Hugh Lane, February 3rd, 1915.&quot;The &quot; purposes of his Will&quot; are the sale of prac-tically his entire property (some legacies to his family excepted), to be invested and the proceeds given to the National Gallery of Dublin, &quot; the income to be spent on buying pictures of deceased painters of established merit.&quot;Because of the lack of a witness, the pictures have become the property of the London National Gallery. Memorials were laid before the Trustees at their Board Meeting on November the 14th last by me and by the Representatives of the Educational Establish-ments and Learned Societies of Dublin, and by the Lord Mayor and Corporation of Dublin, asking that
the last wishes of Sir Hugh Lane, as expressed in his Codicil, might be carried out. The Trustees, after consulting with the Treasury, answered that they have been informed by the Treasury, acting upon the advice of the Treasury&apos;s Solicitor, that as Trustees of the National Gallery they have no power to dis-pose by gift to the National Gallery of Ireland or any other body of objects which are vested in them by virtue of Sir Hugh Lane&apos;s legally drawn and at-tested Will and of the provisions of the National Gallery Act of 1856.&quot; It is to empower them to carry out these last wishes of the Testator that we ask the help of Parliament to-day.AUGUSTA GREGORY.POSTSCRIPTI add to this statement a statutory declaration by Mrs. Shine, Sir Hugh Lane&apos;s sister, describing the circumstances under which the Codicil was written and her reasons for believing that he intended it to have the weight of law; a statutory declaration by Mr. Martin, my nephew&apos;s close friend, and by Mrs. Duncan, curator of the Dublin Municipal Gallery, and a report of a conversation by Mr. John Quinn, one of the governing body of the Metropolitan Museum of New York, to show that Sir Hugh Lane did not change his intention in the last weeks of his life. Mr. Quinn has wired that he has also made a statu-tory declaration, but I have not thought it desirable to delay the pamphlet for its arrival. A. G.
APPENDIX II, RUTH SHINE of Lindsey House, 100 Cheyne Walk, London, S.W., Widow, do solemnly and sin-cerely declare as follows:The late Sir Hugh Lane was a brother of mine and he is hereinafter referred to as &quot;my brother.&quot;In January 1915 my brother spoke to me of making another will. He went to Dublin, however, without having done so. It was there (on February 3rd) that he. wrote and signed his codicil and locked it in his desk at the National Gallery in a sealed en-velope addressed to me; it was very clearly and carefully written and I have no doubt whatever that he considered it legal.My brother had no business habits in the ordinary sense of the word and was ignorant of legal technical-ities. He dictated both his wills to me, the first leaving all to the Modern Art Gallery in Dublin and the second leaving all to the National Gallery of Dublin with the exception of the French pictures left to London. But for my persistence neither would have been witnessed; even when he dictated the second will he had forgot-ten all I had told him about that necessity. So little am I surprised at there being no witnesses to the codicil that my surprise is altogether that he should have written it so carefully. He must have made rough drafts, as he composed letters with great diffi-culty, and the codicil was so well written.I think from my knowledge of him that if he thought of a witness at all he would perhaps have considered that a codicil to an already witnessed will
needed no further formality. When he sealed up the envelope he was going on a dangerous journey to America, and was so much impressed by that danger that at first he had refused to go at all unless those, who had invited him for business reasons, would in-sure his life for  50,000 to clear his Estate of certain liabilities, and he thought he was going not in seven or eight weeks as it happened but in two or three.I have approached this subject without any bias in favour of Dublin but as his sister anxious that his intentions should be carried out, and I make this de-claration conscientiously believing the same to be true and by virtue of the Provisions of the Statutory Declaration Act 1835.RUTH SHINE.Declared at Markham House, King&apos;s Road, Chelsea, in the County of London, this 13th day of February 1917Before meG. F. WILKINS.a commissioner for oaths.I, ELLEN DUNCAN, Curator of the Dublin Municipal Gallery of Modern Art, 17 Harcourt Street in the City of Dublin, aged 11 years and up-wards make oath and say as follows:1. For fifteen years I was acquainted with the late Sir Hugh Lane, who was a close personal friend of my husband and myself.2. Sir Hugh Lane was Honorary Director of the Municipal Gallery of Modern Art until his death. I was Curator from October 1914. Whenever he came to Dublin he spent a good deal of time in the Gallery and took a keen interest in its working and obtained some gifts for it, the last being a bust by Rodin.8
3. I last saw Sir Hugh Lane on the last day of his stay in Dublin before he sailed for America. He came to the gallery that day and had a conversation with me about his collection of continental pictures which were then stored in the London National Gallery. He said that he wished to bring these pictures to Dublin. He said that with regard to the building of a new gallery he did not wish to insist now upon any special plan but would be content if the Corporation reaffirmed their already expressed intention of build-ing a gallery. He asked me whether I thought I could get the Corporation to give some assurance to this effect. The words he used were, &quot; I do not wish to appear to have&apos; climbed down&apos; about a new gallery building, but I do not wish to revive any of the old controversies. I wish to bring the pictures back to Dublin as soon as possible, and they might be re-hung here pending the building of any gallery the Corporation may decide upon.&quot;4. The impression I gathered from the conversa-tion aforesaid was that Sir Hugh Lane had definitely made up his mind to adhere to his original intention with regard to these pictures which he bought for the Dublin Municipal Gallery of Modern Art. He ex-pressed himself as indignant at the way in which these pictures had been treated by the London National Gallery, with the result that the public had no opportunity of seeing them.ELLEN DUNCAN.Sworn this 12th day of February 1917 at City Hall in the City of Dublin before me a Commissioner to administer oaths for the Supreme Court of Judicature in.Ireland and 1 know deponent.HENRY LEMASS, Commr.for Oaths. 9 A2
I, ALEXANDER MARTIN, of 37, Vicarage Road, East&quot; Sheen, do solemnly and sincerely declare as follows: I have been asked to state in a word my impression of Sir Hugh Lane&apos;s wishes regarding these Pictures, in so far as I gathered it in conversation with him when I accompanied him to Liverpool.1 I .am pleased to accede to this request, and I should like to preface it with the remark that it was the more strongly fixed in my mind because his wishes as he expressed them were not those with which I had most sympathy. Personally, I should have pre-ferred to have seen the Pictures placed in London rather than in Dublin. From earlier conversations I was aware, of course, of Sir Hugh Lane&apos;s deep in-terest in Ireland, and was not, therefore, at all sur-prised when on this occasion he spoke of it, and of his recent visit to Dublin, with the greatest affection. He spoke to me also of the Modern Gallery, referring again to the ambition he had entertained when col-lecting the Pictures of seeing them housed in Dublin, and he gave me to understand that his mind was made up that it should after all be the destination of his Pictures, and I make this declaration conscienti-ously believing the same to be true, and by virtue of the Provisions of the Statutory Declaration Act, 1835. Signed   ALEXANDER MARTIN.Declared at No. 15 Duke Street, St. James&apos;s, in the County of Middlesex, this 27 day of February 1917. Before me,A.

What he did say was that when the war was over and when Home Rule had come, if they would make some provision for a gal-lery and I recall his saying not necessarily the Bridge site he would give them (the pictures) to Dublin, as he always wanted them to go there.JOHN QUINN.I I

APPENDIX IV5, Cromwell Place, S.W. yth February 1917.To the Trustees of the National Gallery, LondonMy Lords and Gentlemen,We the undersigned are convinced that it was the last wish of Sir Hugh Lane that the group of French Pictures collected by him for the Dublin Municipal Gallery and now in the possession of the National Gallery of London should be returned to Dublin.As we recognize that the pictures are the legal property of the National Gallery we believe that their return would be an act, not only of justice, but of generosity, and we would respectfully suggest that the Trustees apply to Parliament for the necessary powers.The signatories to this Memorial have all con-tributed pictures to the Dublin Municipal Gallery, believing that their work would hang in a great re-presentative collection of modern painting, and are convinced that the breaking of the collection some of the pictures going to London and some remaining in Dublin would lessen the value of the whole, to Artist and to Student alike.We have the honour to be,My Lords and Gentlemen,Your obedient Servants,John Lavery.

Lane Pictures Committee, 44 St. Stephens Green, Dublin.January ityh, 1917.Sir,I have the honour to present herewith on behalf of my Committee the enclosed Memorial from 150 Irish Artists and men of letters, petitioning His Majesty&apos;s Government to give effect to the last wishes of the late Sir Hugh Lane, as expressed in the Codicil to his Will, with regard to the disposal of his collection of Modern Continental pictures. I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant, BEATRIX DUNCAN. Hon. Secretary.The Right Honourable David Lloyd George, Prime Minister of England.To the Right Hon. David Lloyd George, Prime Minister of England.Sir,We, the undersigned Irish Artists and Writers venture to appeal to you as the head of His Majesty&apos;s Government to give statutory recognition to the terms of the unwitnessed codicil of Sir Hugh Lane&apos;s Will, bequeathing his collection of Modern Con-continental Art to the City of Dublin.These pictures were originally hung in the Dublin Municipal Art Gallery as a gift contingent on the erection of a suitable gallery, and remained there for some years, pending the fulfilment of the conditions.Owing to circumstances into which we need not here enter it was not found possible to fulfil the necessary conditions within the specified time. Sir22
Hugh Lane then removed the pictures from Dublin to exhibit them as a loan collection in London, in order that their merits might be more widely known, and while there he devised them in a duly executed will to the National Gallery of England.Subsequently, however, Sir Hugh Lane reverted to his original intention, as expressed in a previous will, and bequeathed the pictures by the codicil to which we have alluded, to the City of Dublin.Although this codicil was not witnessed, it is in-disputably under his hand and signature, nor is there any doubt in our minds that this was his real desire.Sir Hugh Lane repeatedly expressed his determina-tion in conversations with his friends before his last departure to the United States, to restore the pictures to Dublin, there to form the nucleus of that per-manent collection of Modern Art which he con-sidered so essential to the interests of Art in his native country.Although the Trustees of the National Gallery of England do not dispute the authenticity of this codicil and view sympathetically the claims of the City of Dublin, they are nevertheless precluded in their fiduciary capacity from carrying out its terms.Knowing as we do how universal is the desire in Ireland that these pictures should return to Dublin, we appeal to His Majesty&apos;s Government to introduce legislation giving effect to the codicil. We have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient servants, Joseph Poole Addey.        Mary Barton. George Atkinson, Rose Barton, R.W.S.R.H.A. Louie Bennett.W. F. Bailey, C.B., P.C.   Thomas Bodkin.
