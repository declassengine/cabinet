PAY OF UORKIffiH FOR SATURDAY, 19th JULY.  Memorandum by the First Commissioner of TJorks)I invite the attention of the .,rar Cabinet to a special difficulty with which I am confronted in regard to the holiday declared in connection with Peace Celebrations.   I raised the point on a previous occasion with the War Cabinet as to whether payment for the Peace Holiday should be made to workmen engaged by my Department,   The decision then given was that directly employed men should be paid for the day and that those engaged through Contractors should bo governed by the practice in the Trades concerned.In my Department, while certain men are employed direct by the Department on Maintenance work, a considerable body of men who are doin/v identical work are technically employed . by the Maintenance Contractors.   The Contractors on this work aro paid on the basis of a percentage on the cost of labour and have to employ such men as are approved by tho Technical Officers of my Department.   As a matter of fact, the men, many of whom have been doinfj this work for the Department for many years, pass from one contractor to another if the Main-tenance Contracts change hands.   These men who are thus employed, consider themselves as Government Servants just as much as established men, and in ^iiiity^ this is tho case.   They feel this as a great grievance and rioro than once have approached me on the subject.   They have pointed out, what is a fact, that while they have been compulsorily made to take a holiday they received no payment, other fellow workmen on the same jobs received payment,I am giving careful consideration to the whole method of carrying out the maintenance work of this Department with the object of obviating these inconsistences, but in the meantime there is serious discontent amongst&apos; the men who have not been paid for the Peace holiday.I Should be glad, in view of the exceptional circumstances of the case, if the Cabinet could see its way to permit of the payment of all men continuously engaged on maintenanceiwork whatever the method of their engagement.   Tho amount Involved is  1,100.I do not propose that this should be extended to the ordinary Bank Holidays, for which, of course, there is long established precedent, namely, that men employed by Contractors are paid only for time actually worked.I therefore pross for authority to be allowed to make those payments, which,to my mind, are only just and fair in the cir-cumstances and which will do away with a feeling of resentment on the part of the men which is conducive to tho best work on the important jobs on which they are engaged.(Sgd)   ALFRED MOW).HisJ-fajesty^ Oggice of works, 1st August, 1919.
