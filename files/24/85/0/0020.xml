From Viceroy, Foreign Department, 27 ill July 19.19. (Received 9 a.in.)Secret.   Afghanistan.   Following from Roos-Keppel, dated the 25th July : -&quot; Sir, Abdul Qadyum has obtained from Tirah, a copy of a new proclamation issued by Amir to his subjects and to frontier tribes.   Only a very limited number of copies* seem to have been distributed. Proclamation begins with salutation to Saiyids, Ulemas, Sheikhs, Nawabs, Khans, Maliks and the brave tribes, of the frontier. It proceeds that in order to safeguard honour and freedom of Afghans both of internal Afghanistan of: its border Amir informed people of his intentions (to make war) and tribes gave proof of their (corrupt group) by responding&apos;to his call. As there is now an armistice and Ali Ahmad Khan has been sent to India for settlement tribes should suspend fighting for the present. If honourable peace with all respect and honour for Afghanistan is obtained well and good, but if not Amir will carry on holy war until death tyou the noble tribes and the mighty Afghans should also stand firmly united and courageous for the achievement of this end.&apos; (?Both) should remain ready at fixed centres during armistice and should take (?&quot;rest). If Amir can obtain his objects without further fighting, well and good, but if not, he will continue war with all possible strength. &apos; I shall not transact any State affairs without the knowledge, consent, and, ad vice of you my subjects.&apos;&quot;I am posting to you original and translation (of) quotation which is interesting as- being first open proclamation addressed by any Amir to our frontier tribes since the Durand Mission and a clear avowal of Amir&apos;s complicity in tribal risings of the last three months. Reilly reports all Wakhis ready and ask(ing) permission to come into Chitral as refugees (corrupt group). Afghan conscripts and asks for orders, f have instructed him to discourage Wakhis from coming&apos; in as their presence would only be a further complication. I have received reliable and detailed information of arrival from Kabul of another batch of bombs specially destined for Sir Abdul Qadyum and myself and have hopes of intercepting them. We-have obtained an autograph letter from Maulvi Obedulla, President of Provisional Government of India to the Hindustani fanatics, in which Maulvi states that he has decided to establish a centre movement at Chamarkand-in Bajaur. Ghulam Muhammad (corrupt group), Afghan Peace Delegate, is a brother of Ghulam Haidar, late Afghan Postmaster, Peshawar, and it is believed that Ghulam,Muhammad is prepared (corrupt group) (corrupt group) influence in our favour in hopes of getting his brother released. Kurram telegraphs that iNadir Khan is reported to&apos; have received a large sum in Bokhara coins for expenditure, and is (corrupt group) ing on border of Kurram seeing local jirga. His brother Akbar Khan is reported to have-arrived from Waziristan on Kharlachi front. Afghans continue to fire upon our pickets, and at villagers working in the fields in the neighbourhood of Kharlachi.( All other districts and agencies quiet.&quot;It seems possible that proclamation, though doubtless intended to reach one tribe, is actually addressed not to them but to Afghan frontier tribes. &quot;Sending original may clear this up.
