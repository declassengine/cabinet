Up to the week ending 28th July, 1919, the Board have issued under Regulation 2M(f) 765 notices determining the tenancies of an aggregate 57,637 aoree.    Three notices were issued during the w&amp;ok affecting 377 acres.In September, 1910, the occupiers of Bcnknowle Farm, glwick, Messrs. J. end 3?. Jobson, were fined  20 and 10 guineas costs for failing to comply with a Cultivation Order served on them in March of that y^ar.     The farm, which consists of 90 acres, 50 of which are arable, was stated by the Durham A.J5.C. to be in a deplorable condition.&apos;   In June uf this yeir the B*iird!s Commissioner reported th^t there had been no improvement;   the occupiers are both too old to be capable cf doing the necessary work, and it 1b questionable whether they could get any labourers to stay with them.     The Beard have, therefore, authorised the Executive Committee to enter upon and take possession cf the farm, including the farm house and buildings.     The Committee consider that they will have no difficulty in letting tho farm to a suitable tenant.4.
The Board have issued an. Order determining tho tenancy of Hollow lioadow 8uittorfield.    The farm has an area of168 acres, of which neatly half is arable, and has boon undor the observation, of the Jarwic^ A./J.C. for over 10 months.   Cultivation Orders were served on the occupier in Do Comber, 1917, and in May, 1919, but the Orders were not fully carried out *     Throe of the Executive Officers of the Committee inspected the farm early in May, of this year, and reported that it was in a filthy condition.. At the end of the month the Board&apos;o Commissioner reported that the whole of the farm was in a most unsatisfactory state, the hedges had not been trimmed for many years, and tho ditches were full.   The tenant appears to have neither the energy nor the capacity to cultivate the land satisfactorilyfl    The Committee have been asked to serve the notice as soon as thuy are satisfied that in the event of its taking effwet, a new tenant can be installed without delay.In August, 1.918, the County of BputhaiD^txn A.3.C. took possession of 74 acres of land at Ot&apos;oerbovI^ie^afVbT&quot;tht-J tenancy had been determined.     The land was lot by the fixocufivo Committee in equal portions to two tenants, one of whom has proved unsatisfactory, The tenant of the remaining half, win is working well, has&apos; expressed his willingness to take ever the tenancy of the whole of the land., The Board have issued an Order to determine the tenancy, but have suggested that before serving the Order the Coiamittce should endeavour to persuade the tenant to quit at once voluntarily.   If, within a specified limit of time, he does not signify his willingness to give up the land, the Notice will be served.The Radnor A.5-J.C. have applied for a notice to determine the tenancy of Tynywern Farm, llanfihangel, Ilhydithon. Radnor (173 acres), as none of the stubble land has been cultivated tin a season, and the tenant is not in a position to coxxy out the work.     The Board&apos;s Sub-Commissioner reports that the occupier is living the life of a hermit, and that owing to his neglect the farm is rapidly becoming derelict.    No provision has been made for wintering the stock, and the occupier does not appear to realise the neoessity for providing for future exigencies.     The Board have issued an Order determining the tenancy forthwith.(iii)     Provision of Allotments.The Yorkshire ffast Hiding County Council   made an Order for the compulsory hiring of 16$ acres of land in the Parish of Broomfleet for the purpose of allotments*     Objections to the Order were received from the owners, the&apos; Humber Conservancy Board, and from the occupier *     A local enquiry was held by Mr, Diggle who, as a result, wa3 able to make satisfactory arrangements between the present tenant and the Parish Council for thin leasing of the land to the Parish Council for the remaining part of his lease, namely y^ars, and to give possession, free of tenant right, after the harvesting of the crop now on the land,     This was agreed to by all parties concerned and the Compulsory Order was withdrawn.(iv)   Tithe. Commons,, Copyhold and Survey.The Board have determined adversely to tho objections received to the Schedules of Assessment of Redemption Money and Expenses in two compulsory rode-we.&apos; on oa^os. affecting numerous properties at Karton in Cleveland. (York,        ) and Seal (Leicester) respectively.     All the objections were due to misunderstandings by the objectors regarding points of law.     The Board furnishede.
the objectors with full explanations.The Somersei County Council have requested the Board to identify on the Tithe kap the lande which they have acquired under the Small Holdings Act, 1900, for the purpose of small holdings,&apos; with a view to the redemption of the tithe rentcharge charged on the lands.The Board have approved a Rate of l/- pf,? stint to he . levied on the owners of stints upon EaBt Stainraore Regulated Common, Westmorland^ to noet the expenses to he incurred &quot;by the Conservators cf thci Common for tho year ending 1st February ncxtiThe Board have also approved a Scheme for the Regulation, under the Commons Act, 1899, of Bitterne otherwise Freemantle Comen (Hants), by Which the management of the Common, which comprises about 12 acres, has been vented in the Itchon Urban District Council.In connection with the hearing of the case Collis, v. toahlcrfrjf f whioh id an action for alleged encorachment on Clent Kill Common (Worcester) an officer of the Board has attended at  &apos; the House of Lords three times during tho past week to produoo documents relating to an Award confirmed by tho Board under the; Incloaure Acts on the 14th April, 1891, whereby the common is regulated.Commercial D^vis^n.jquibment ,o  Small;holding*    In rirder tt meet housing needs in Cornwall apbrtYal has been giv$n to the purchase by the v-County Council.of1 2?

Ptr soar time past negotiations have been going on between the Cheltenham Corporation and the Gloucester Fruit and Vegetable Sositfty, whereby the Cheltenham Auction Mart should be placed under tho management of the Society who would employ their twn Auctioneer and control the sales.   A definite arrangement has now been made whereby the Fruit and Vegetable Society rent the Cheltenham Market for  200 per annum for 5 years and pay the Auctioneer who has previously been carrying on business  800 for his goodwill.    A substantial Society of Market Gardeners, tho Cheltenham Growers1 Society, has joined with the Gloucestershire Society, and the two will work tho Auction together.    It is hoped by this xaoane that a satisfactory market will be established for the uso of growers in the neighbourhood.Lime.

A Conference was attended at the County Hall, Cambridge, and the Board&apos;s proposals for horticultural education and instruction were outlined.     The Chairman of the Ceunty Council, who was in the Chair, premised that the Board1s proposals should be carried cut immediately and that a representative Committee should be appointed.
Up to the present 19 Ccunties have actually-formed Horticultural Sub-Committees, while definite arrangements have been made in 8 other, counties,    A&quot;conference will shortly be arranged in Worth Wales to discuss this question.Cultivation.     Northampton.     It is proposed to set up a Farm institute on the County Councils Farm at Moultbn; provision is to be made for about 5 acres of land for fruit and vegetable culture, and it is intended to appoint a Horticultural Superintendent to the Staff.Northumberland.     The Alnwick Moor Strawberry Growing District was visited and the method of cultivation found to be very bad, owing to the laziness and apathy of the holders.     This is a good district for strawberry growing, which with proper cultivation could be made profitable.Montgomeryshire.     The orchards in this county all bear well in normal years, but great difficulty is found in disposing of the produce, probably through lack of co-operation.Anglesey.     The Anglesey Bulb Farm, the training centre for ex-Service men, has been visited.     The comparatively limited variety of produce grown does not give sufficient scope for imparting full instruction in the best methods of market gardening.     IvCore attention should be paid to the selection of varieties both as regards fruit and vegetables.General,     Twenty six visits have been made during the week to growers, allotments, etcFruit Preservation..     The Board of Agriculture for Scotland have conveyed to the Board their sincere appreciation of the services rendered by the Boards Principal Demonstrator in Fruit Preservation, in the series of demonstrations recently given in Scotland with the object of stimulating interest in Fruit and Vegetable conservation.The Board&apos;s Chief Instructor has reported that Fruit Preservation is being enthusiastically carried out in the district of Birmingham owing to the success of the Board&apos;s demonstrations and exhibits.Beekeeping.     A Supply of Sugar for Winter Feeding.   The Hard are endeavouring to make arrangements with the Royal Commission on the Sugar Supply for the immediate release of the supply of sugar for purposes of winter feeding in order that beekeepers may feed their stocks partly at an early date and partly in the season as the condition of their bees requires.Up to the present 184 Stocks and 283 Queens have been sent out and 508 nuclei have been made.Visits to Restocking Apiaries.     The Board&apos;s Bee expert has been occupied in visiting various Restocking Apiaries and reports that, speaking generally, no difficulties have been experienced in introducing the imported Queens, excepting in such cases where the special instructions which were circulated have not been closely followed.     Vith the exception of three, all the apiaries appear to be well managed.
fonall Live Stock Section.    It ia understood that Railway Companies will now accept tame rabbits for consumption at Owners Risk Rate.     This concession should greatly encourage rabbit keeping, as the cost of rail transit will be halved, and the fact that rabbits can now be sent alive should ensure consumers obtaining a fresh rabbit, and this should certainly increase the demand.The Board are still receiving numerous enquiries from rabbit keepers for assistance in marketing their surplus stocks and also in connection with rabbit diseases.Plant Diseases Section.     Wart Disease.     Further outbreaks of this disease have   been reported from North Wales and from Lancashire.     In the latter county disease has also been found on rogues in crops grown in the Infected Area.   A few cases of illegal planting of susceptible varieties by recently demobilized ex-Soldiers have been discovered. Inspectors are continuing their survey of the potato crops mentioned in previous reports.     It is reported that the crops of Sdgell Blue, Kerr&apos;s Pink, Great Scot and King George in Lancashire are looking remarkably well.Potato Blight.    Further outbreaks have occurred in Denbigh, the attack in each ease being slight.American Gooseberry Hldew.    Reports of outbreaks of this disease have been received from diifferent parts of the country.     Inspectors are visiting infected premises where possible, and advising as to the preventive measures to be taken.    In the North of England it appears that, with the exception of the Tweed Valley and parts of Cumberland, there is very little disease present.     Several consignments of gooseberries in markets containing diseased fruit have been reported, and opportunity ia being taken by Inspectors to examine the plantations on which such fruit was grown.    One licence for the importation of Dutch Gooseberries into this country has been issued, and this trade is now practically finished for this season.Other Diseases.    Onion Smut.     The publicity given to this disease has resulted in a number of specimens of diseased onions being forwarded for examination, but only one further case of Onion Smut has been found.     Thi3 case occurred in Northampton, and was confined to a few plants. Silver Leaf.    Cases of this disease continue to come under notice.Many growers are alive to its importance and are destroying affected branches immediately on the appearance Of disease.Labour Division,Demobilization.

\Women&apos;8 Branch.The arrangements for the taking over of the Women&apos;8 ^:&apos;ar Agricultural Committees by the Agricultural Executive Committees as their Sub-Committees are in most cases completed.     Details in regard to carrying cut the work have been left to the two Committees to deoide, and it is interesting to see the effect that previous close cr-operation has had on the amalgamation.Demands for a large number of women in the last Riding for flax pulling have been referred to the Ministry of Labour as Land Army v&apos;omen   were not available.     100 women had been ashed for in the Isle of -u&apos;.;ly to secure a crop of valuable blue peas.      It would not have-been possible to supply these had not a number of women booked for pulling flax in Northampton been available, as the crop in that county was not ready.There has been a renewed demand for tractor drivers during the past week.     Eleven applications for women have been received.     Five of the number are required at once, the remainder to commence work directly the harvest begins.     every   effort is being made to meet these demands, and to withdraw girls, previously in the Tractor Section of the Land Army, with as little inconvenience as possible to the other work on which they have been engaged since the withdrawal of the tractors from Government service.Women1s Institutes,     On Saturday, July 25th, an exhibition was held at Oxford Town Hall at which exhibits from 27 institutes in the County were shown.     The exhibits of vegetables, fruit and bread were excellent, and emphasised the agricultural nature of Institute developments.     The exhibition was opened by Lady Denman who was introduced to a large gathering of country women by the Mayor;   the latter expressed his pleasure at the good work being accomplished by the Institutes in the County,Seven new Institutes were started last week, making a total of 1,170.
