(THIS EOCTOMT IS THE PROPERTY 01 HI 3 3HITAMIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOvTOITOT.,/SECRET.G.T. 7880, WAR CABINET.PAYMENT. OF MCBERS OP LOCAL AUTHORITIES *emorandum &quot;by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.TO THE KEMBERS OP THE WAR CABINET,The Memorandum submitted by the Minister of Health (G.T. 7767) dealing with the payment of members of local authorities raises important issues which are bound to affect Irish local administration if this principle is adopted for England.   . When once conceded, there would inevitably be a strong and persistent demand for the application of the prinaiple to the case of Irish,looal authorities, which it would be difficult, if not impossible, to resist.Hitherto there has not been very much trouble over the election of members of Irish, local government governing bodies, &quot;but if the attraction is now held out that the members may &quot;be paid for loss of time and expenses incurred, the standard Of purity - such as it is - of local administration will be seriously undermined.    At present elections to salaried offices under local bodies have frequently been accompanied by bribery and the exercise of undue influence, and with the rise of Sinn Fein there has-been a great deal of intimidation of candidates and voters hostile to Sinn Fein, which has even been carried to the length of waylaying the supporters of candidates and.preventing-them from attending meetings.   Such an instance occurred quite recently in TipperaryI have consulted the Vice-President of the Irish Local Government Board who has had long experience of Irish local administration, and he tells me that if this principle of payment were introduced disturbances at the elections are bound to occur.     He also states that the new bodies elected on, this, basis will see that the councils and committees are -constantly in session.I may mention that the Irish local boards have always a large sprinkling of needy persons to whom the prospect of being paid for their loss of time would be highly attractive. The membership of local boards might easily become a regular profession in Ireland and the respectable citizen with a sense of public duty would be very soon driven out of local political life.   - -I hope, therefore, that this principle will not be sanctioned.&apos;    If It is, we in Ireland will have to face a constant agitation from a certain section of the population for its application to this country-.(Intd.) ,1. M.Chief Secretary^ Office, Dublin Castle,2nd August, 1919.
