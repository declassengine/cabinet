m aTHIS EOCnvMT IS THE PROPERTY OF HT3 LPITOSIC MAJESTIES GOylSi^hToWAR   CABINET.secret the HATIOHALISATIOH OF COAL. MINES.G.T.7897.Memo, &quot;by MrcGJT, Br.rn.es, .I have- read during the week the whole of the matter respecting the- above *   The situation.has, I think, got beyond the measures adumbrated by Dr. Shadweli, Lord Gainford, or the Mining Association. There are, I believe, currents running to-day in favour of national-, isation.   This feeling is not confined to miners or even to manual workers.   It extends to large numbers of people belonging to all classes.,   The second fact in my mind is that a Judge has endorsed tfe idea as a pr&amp;etieal proposal after hearing evidence on both sides and knowing all the facts.     That also will count amongst large num-bers of people.    We have to consider the matter in the light of those two facts,   Nationalisation is a big risk which we should not lightly take,I want some course taken which would be an experiment large enough to be a guide for further action if necessary, but not too large to involve us in irretrievable trouble if it should fail.   I am told that    the plan I suggested in my memo of last week was unani mously turned down by the Commission because of fear of slackness in the unnationaliaed areas.   Sir Hubert Smith1s plan of District Boards is not open to that objection and it meets my other requirements. I should be inclined to give it a trial.   It does not conflict with Mr.Justice Sanfcejr, They both proposed purchase, joint control, and State risk. But Sir Hubert Smithes proposals are less committal. Assuming unification in areas to be settled, then the scheme mey be said to be a compromise between the shareholder control of Sir Arthur Duckham, and the national control of Mr.Justice Sankey - an experiment in partpirarthe whole field, instead of an experiment &apos; entirely over a part of it.   It has the merit of being, as I say, les committal, for if it should fail reversion to the shareholder control plan of Duckhan^s would be easier than reversion from a pi n of Sankey&apos;s after it had been tried and failed.The question of wages falls to be considered as a something apart.   It&quot;has an important bearing upon the success or failure of any scheme,    Mr.Justice Sankey leaves adjustments of the standard of rates to the mining council with appeal from local to district and from district to national as the case may be one of local or national importance,.   For reasons given by Sir Hubert Smith, I prefer his method of a separate wage conference.   Duckham.1 s method is&quot; theoretically &quot;better than either of the others because he brings in tne Minister of Labour to settle miners wages in common with all wages.&apos;   Bai that case has been given away.   The Miners have been dealt with direct while others have had to go to the Committee on Production.   If possible, I should adopt Duckham1 s scheme, but I am afraid it is too late.   The best thing open to us is that proposed by Sir Hubert Smith.But there is another special aspect of wages, namely &quot;bonus. Mr,. Justice Sankey proposed a bonus on output.   I feel very strongly that any scheme of bonus should be regarded as something apart fromstandard/
stand&amp;rt wages and should &quot;be divided pro rata on a collective basis so that each man would have an interest in keeping his fellow worker up to efficiency.    This method has worked Well during the war.Sir Arthur fiackham alone proposes to deal with coal conserva-* tion.   It is almost as important as coal getting.   I speak with toaowledge of What has been done in the way of economies in steam generation,   &apos; There has been an enormous savin-; in many oases, amounting to. 25$ and ever,   I heartily support Duckhan^s plea of thorough enquiry, and as almost a preliminary I should have steps taken to ap&apos;j)ly better methods of generation of steam at onoe in industrial undertakings.Re the principle of nationalisation it is worthy of note that out of 874 memorialists to tho Prime Minister against nationalisa-tion 243 are Conservatives.   The memorial therefore rartakes of the character of a party political manifesto.(Initialled) G;. K. 3.6th August 1919. -2, \ /hi t ehall Garde as,S.-:.l
