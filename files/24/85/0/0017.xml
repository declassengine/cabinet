1084 S. Secret. Afghanistan. Following from Roos-Keppel. First, dated 23rd July :-

" There is now no Afridi gathering in Bazar or Chura. Afridi maliks and elders sent message to Sir Abdul Qadyam that they had intended to bring whole tribal jirga to him at Landi Kotal, but had decided that it was more, important firstly to hold jirga in Maidan with deserters and bad characters and obtain assurance from them for their future good behaviour. They assured him that Afridis as a tribe could be relied on not to rise against Government. It was suggested that a deputation should be sent to Shahgassi Khwaja Muhammad at Kahi to protest against his treachery, but elders opposed this, as they distrust communications with Afghan oliicials. All the Afridi lashkars feel that they have been betrayed by Shahgassi, and many suggested reprisals on Kahi, but the elders opposed this. A contingent from Ningrahar, which had come to Chura at Yar Muhammad Khan&apos;s request, is still in the neighbourhood of Chura and the Kajuri plain. Zar Shah of Dehsarak, who brought original lashkar to Bagh, is with them, and they are bent on raiding and in the Peshawar district, but they cannot do much without Afridi support. Total number of Ningraharis with Zar Shah is about 200. Kuki Khel of Jamrud and Kadam have volunteered to send out patrols to intercept Zar Shah&apos;s gang, but are afraid of coming into contact with troops who could not distinguish them from enemy. Throughout recent trouble of the collection of lashkars in Bazar, Kuki Khel have behaved very well and have guarded successfully the approaches to Jamrud. Kohat telegraphs that representative jirga of Jowakis visited Deputy Commissioner yesterday and informed him that they had decided to impose fines on members of their tribe who might commit offences in British territory. Kurram reports that Kurram Mangals are beginning once more to send in recruits for Militia (corrupt group) able to do so recently as all men were required for defence of villages."

Second, dated 24th July :-

"It is rumoured among tribes that Amir has proclaimed a trace during the Peace negotiations. Some say for 15 days, others say for 40 days (corrupt group)."

Following from Waziristan:-

"It is reported that Mullah Fazl Din has advised Mahsuds to discontinue hostilities for 15 days during Peace negotiations. Mahsud lashkar in the Shuja nulla has dispersed. Mahsud contingent in Boya has been strengthened by 200 Madda Khel. Loyal Daurs in the vicinity under Khan Muhammad Khan have withdrawn and with help of Hamzoni Daurs is organising lashkar to drive out the enemy from Boya. Political Agent, Wano, reports that 1,000 Saif Ali Kabul (corrupt group) Waziris and 3,000 other Waziris have returned from Zhob and admit 16 casualties."
