from Viceroy, olsl July 1910.(deceived 1st August.)Airj^^ar the line.Secret. Afghanistan. My telegram 1104 S. Following from Baluchistan dated 24th July:-.&quot; Very strong rumour here that Abdul left for Kabul three or four dajs ago, probably by motor. Report will be verified as far as possible. If true, it means that his influence will be predominant during negotiations.&quot;Following from Grant, 30th July: &quot; Yesterday I sent Nawab Maula Baksh to represent verbally to Ali Ahmad that Abdul was not carrying out armistice terms and that there was danger of unfortunate incidents which might break clown peace negotiations, and to suggest that Ali Ahmad should write or telegraph to Abdul. Ali Ahmad agreed to write and I have to-day forwarded by hand to Assistant Agent to Governor-General, Baluchistan, two letters from Ali Ahmad for delivery to Abdul. These letters were read by Mania Baksh and sealed in his presence as Ali Ahmad did not want Abdul to know the letters had been censured. The translation of the first begins : &apos; His Majesty the Amir has already informed you by a firman that a temporary armistice has been arranged until such time as the peace delegates of India may proceed to India and settle peace terms, and that until that time the troops of the Afghan Government should be removed to a distance of 10 miles from trOops of the British Government. Accordingly I have been appointed chief of delegates, and, having safely arrived at Rawal Pindi with the other delegates, have commenced negotiations for a peace honourable to the Govern-ment of Afghanistan. I have now received information from Honourable Sir H. Grant, chief of the British delegates, that the troops of the Afghan Government have not moved from their former places, that is to say, that you have not removed your troops to distance of 10 miles as ordered by His Majesty the Amir, I therefore write to ask you to remove the Kandahar and frontier troops to distance of 10 miles in compliance with orders of His Majesty the Amir, so that, please God, peace may be concluded which may be honourable to Afghanistan, otherwise the whole Afghan nation will have to sacrifice everything in a war in paths of God.&quot; &apos; I hope that you will very carefully restrain your troops and &quot; mujahidin &quot; until peace is concluded.&apos;&quot; Otherwise the second letter begins : &apos; I safely arrived at Rawal Pindi on Friday, 26th. Shawal 1337 Hijra corresponding to 1910, together with the other delegates to the peace conference. I have had an interview with the Honourable Sir H. Grant, but have not yet discussed peace terms with him. I hope that you will manage your affairs as directed by His Majesty the Amir, and use your best endeavours in the discharge of the duties entrusted to you. I pray to God that the settlement may be favourable to Islam and to our King and nation.&apos;&quot; Of course Ali Ahmad is wrong in specifying ten as the limit required by the armistice terms, but the great thing appears to be to get Abdul to make some with-drawal, and perhaps ten miles will temporarily satisfy military requirements. I did not think-it prudent to argue the point with Ali Ahmad.&quot;,Second letter is identic letter sent to all Generals and Governors except on Dakka side. .    .
