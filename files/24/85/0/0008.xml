:^,y,.^....... ^   ^ Balfour. (Astoria, Paris). July 23rd, 1919,D. 3,47 p.m,, July 23rd,1919. -Vu 9.0 pan.,   July 23rd, 1919, 110,1188,    Urgent,Following for Lord Mi Inert, I have seen your memorandum of War Cabinet paper -Gr,TP77 32 July 18th, about ratification of Treaty by Canadian Parliament,   The only course is it seems to me to telegraph to Canadian Government and also to other Dominion Governments explaining that ratification of Treaty as soon as possible is imperative as otherwise Peace cannot bo estab&quot; lished, nor ce-n s$ap any of comissions bo set up.    For various reasons tho only three Powers who are in a position to ratify quickly aro British Empire, France and italy  Franco and Italy aro expected to have ratified before August 10th and British Parliament before end of July.&apos; It would be disastrous if whole cf Peace of tho world were tobo hung up for months because Canadian Parliament had adjourned, and in-order to give time for treaty to roach Australia and bs die-cussed and approved by Australian Parliament, It would seem in tho -circumstances to be the right course that Treaty should be ratified by His Majesty on behalf of all His Dominions subject to a declaration, that ratification (? onee) put in, does not preclude Him from depositing further ratifications on behalf of each of Dominions as soon as Treaty haft been approved by their respective Parliaments,I should be inclined also to add this is simply ono more illustration of practical difficulties which arise out of existing constitutional organisation of British Empire,and
pad to say that this and all analogous questions mast be fully thrashed out and settled at Imperial Conference to discuss the constitution of future Empire which it was in 1917 agreed should follow tho war0   I would also explain that His Majesty&apos;s Government in advising King to ratify, do not wish to prejudice position of Dominions in slightest degree, but do so simply because the overwhelming necessities of world (?situation) drive them to advise His Majesty to ratify Peace as soon as it is technically possible, Dominions will then be in exactly the same position as all other  , signatories, including United States and Japan, since although. Peace is established as soon as three Powers ratify majority of ratifications will not come in till afterwards^..
25th July, 1919.i;fy dear Bad f our irfiitiS5:ti^.iL..Qi.9 0. T^Qsix by,,fee.. fl&amp;]i&amp;lQB&amp; Your telegrato wo, 11^6 of the 23rd July,   There seems to have beon on unfortunate&quot; breakdown of communi-cations between London and Paris on this subject, which I cannot quite account for,   I gather that the matter had not been brought to your notice until you saw my Cabinet Memorandum of Ji.ly 18th.   I don&apos;t quite- khovi how this hap-happened for  immediately on receiving Bordon1s telegram of the 9th, I communicated both with the Prime Hiiiister, who wa.s then at Criccieth, and with the foreign Office, and I understood that the Fore 1,71 Office was consulting Paris. It was only &amp;fter a week had elapsed and I had heard nothing that, feeling, the extreme seriousness of delay and the absolute necessity of giving some answer to Bordon beyond.a nere telogran of a ckuowledglftient&quot;which I had already serrt, I broupj.it the. Matter before the Cabinet.  c This was on Monday the 21st.   The Cabinet left&apos;the decision to the Prime Minister and myself, and after consulting him I sent Bordon and the other Dominion Prime, Ministers the telegrams of July 22ndr vhich you Vve no doubt since received,   It Wt-s only two day3 after their despatch that I &quot;received.your telegram to chichi urn now replying.As matters now stand, it seems to ne that we must wait for answers to these telegrams of July 22nd, especially the telegraWx to borden, before deciding what we ou^ht to do. It is of course impossible, as you say,-&quot;to hang up, the whole pea.ce of the world for,months&quot; for the decision of the Dominion Parliaments, especially as we are virtually, su.re. what the decision will be.   But, on the.other hand, it 3$ very important for the future of the British Empire that, the ratification
217ratification should if possible be effected in fi manner completely satisfactory to oil its ports, -nd giving no occasion for controversy or soreness among ourselves.    If, therefore, it wes a question not, of months but:,of ^eeks., I think we should be wise and fully justified in our own interest, in facing that amount of delay.     And, as it seems to me, if the Dominions or any of them are seriously anxious to have the Treaty approved by their Parliaments before ratification, there is no reason why this should not be done in every cpse - certainly in the case of Canada - by a special session before the end of August. Anyway it seems to me right to give them the chance *    If, they don&apos;t think the thing of sufficient importance to put themselves to that amount of inconvenience, we should be justified in going on without them.    We should of course explain fully, .as we are perfectly able to explain, the special reasons which make it so difficult for us to wait - rlthough of course the fact that America and Japan apparently see no reason for not pursuing the more leisurely course which happens to suit them, rather weakens the argument,    America no doubt says that she cannot be expected to ratify promptly because of her constitutional difficulties. But after all our difficulty is, in essence, a constitutional one too.The one point on which I doirt quite understand your view is the suggestion, tlvt we might ratify -nd at the same time leave it ouen to the Dominions to deposit further ratifications,    I can hardly sunpose that it would be any particular sitisfaction to them to go through what in that case would be a meaningless formality.    Either our ratification binds the whole Empire or it does not.    If it does not,.then;Lt does not fulfil the condition that three of the principal Allied and Associated Powers mist ratify before the Treaty becomes
218elective, for it is the British ^npirs as a whole and 0 riot any. pqrt 0* it, however preponderant, whichsaccording to the terms of the Treaty itself, appears as one of tbe principal Allied and Associated Powers.on the other hand, our ratification does Mud the whole Empire, as I believe it would, then the subsequent ratifications of tbe Dominions are mere imnotent exhibition-tions of the desire for an independence which, in this case, they have not really got.      I cannot believe that this could give any satisfaction to the Dominions, whale, as far as the rest of the world is concerned, it would be only calling attention to the dislocation of our co-istitutional machinery,Of course if the Dominions themselves attach value to and press for such an idle solatium to their sense of national dignity, I should be the last to resist them, but, on the other hand, I don&apos;t see any use in suggesting it.    My hope is that they will either hurry up and get the approval of their several Parliaments, or else I say that, under the circumstances, they will be.satisfied with our ratification of the Treaty for the whole i^empire.    As they have been con-suited about it throughout., as their ministers have actually signed the preliminaries of Peace along with oursalve3, there would be nothing derogatory to the status of the Dominions as partner nations, in a single ratification for the-/whole Empire,Yours vary sincerely, (Signed) Milner.mThe RL-lion.A.
