Lord and Eirst Sea Lord.The number of pooled cars considered to be required for all other Admiralty purposes is 18*Of these 18 oars; 3 would be reserve vehicles to take the place of others under repair.The net number of pooled cars in ordinary use would therefore be *................................. 15.This is ponsidered to be the minimum number which can be maintained, if the efficiency of the work of the Department is not to suffer.As the staff and work of the Admiralty diminish to a more normal level, the number of ears required may be expected to diminish also, but to what extent must depend upon experience.The cars will all be of eoonomioal size and power (Lanoia and Talbot types).The approximate cost of sunning these cars including rent of garage, salaries, wages of civilian drivers, running ^expenses, renewals and repairs, is estimated on present prices at about ,.............., 12,500 a year.It is observed that a suggestion was made to the War Cabinet that economical arrangements could be made with large Car proprietors to provide motor vehicles for use as required.   The Admiralty had already investigated this possibility and found that the cost of such arrangements would be prohibitive,   The charge would be approximately  5 per day per car, whether actually used or not, &apos;It was ascertained that the big newspapers frequently arrange    * for cars to be at the disposal of their representatives for a stated period.   The charge made in such cases has been  30 per * week of 7 days for each car subject to the arrangement, whether actually used or not.(Signed) W.H, LONG.3*8. 19,
