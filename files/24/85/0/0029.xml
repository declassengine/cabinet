TO FffiROnS MMIMS279l ^^^-^XpfciQ^tM-    tHB iRBSIDM Of THE BOARD OF trade the Home Affairs Committee at their 31st meeting onf&apos;Fn&apos;i,i r^\&amp;3* 19th June last, had before them a Memorandum (G*T. *^y^W64) by the Board of Trade on the position of the Non- &quot; Ferrous Mining Industry in tie United Kingdom, in which I recommend that -(1) there should he an immediate enquiry into the whole position of the Non-Petrous Mining Industry in the United Kingdom, with a view to deciding whether the industry can be placed in a satisfactory commercial position;(2) in fe mean time, in or dor to enable mining operations to continue, H.M. Government should undertake to make advances to approved mines up to something less than the breaking- up valuo of their plant and machinery as established by an independent valuation, such loans to hear interest and he repayable in a short term ofThe Home Affairs Commit toe approved these proposals subject in the case of the second to tho conditions that the interest on the advances should he at market rate aid that the details of any particular scheme should be sub-xaitted to the Treasury for their examination and approval.regards the enquiry, I am taking steps to constitute a Departmental uonmittee which will consist of 3 independent, members - or whom 1 will be the Chairman - 2 representatives of the Joint Industrial Council for the Tin Minixg into try and Z representatives of the Interim Recon^h-icticn Commit tee for the Non-Ferrous Mining Indus try (which covers lead, sine and barytes). In each case there will be one representative of the Employers1 side and one of the workpeople&apos;s side.    The Treasury have agreed to the continuance for not longer than a year of the Mineral Resources Development Department of the Ministry of Munitions which will be transferred to the Board of Trade, and that Department will be utilised for the technical enquiries necessary for the work of the Departmental Committee, though it may be necessary to obtain some additional technical assistance.As regards the proposed advances, however, it has been strongly represented to me by the industries oon-concerned that the Government offer is of little practical assistance to them as some of the mines have already raised money on the security of their plant, and that even if they were in a position to avail themselves of the offer it would enable them only to keep going to a limited extent and would not make it possible for them to index*-take any development work.    The Joint Industrial Council for Tin Miniqg and the Interim Committee for Non-Ferrous Mining have beta directed attention to the increasing amount of unemployment and both ask for a Crovemment bonus on production.     I remain of opinion, however, thatany/
any financial assistance which mj be given &quot;by tho Government should &quot;be a charge in some form or other upon the industry, hut subject to this I think that the condition 01 the assistance given might be somewhat easier than those contemplated by the Home Affairs 6ommitteefs decision of tie 19th June. For example, advances might be made free of interest to cover the cost of pumping operations so as to prevent the mines being shut down and flooded before tne enquiry has been completed, and swh advances might be free of interest out- repayable in the event of the mines continuing in operation after the Commit tea has re per ted * It should of course be a condition of any such advances that actual mining operations wereThe eauuiry could I think be completed before the end of fee year,$he Interim Committee for ^on-Ferrous Mining estimate that the amount necessary to keep the pump*:ig plant in operation would not exceed  5,000 a month ior all the lead, zinc and barytes mines, and assuming the arrangement continues for 5 months, this wou&quot;li mean about  25,000.     for the Tin Maes the corresponding amount may be estimated at between  40. OOj and 3,50,000, so&apos; that for the mining indxatry as^a whole the amount required would be approximately 75,000.I recommend therefore that the Board of Trade should be authorised tc negotiate advances on these linen and on the best Germs &quot;wlach can be obtained, subject to the general   Teement of the Treasury, pending the receipt of the Heport of the investigatiL, G* G-EDDS328.7.19
