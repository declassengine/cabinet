Secretary, War.Cabinet:.cPROPOSED REMOVAL OF FINANCIAL RESTRICTIONS.(l)      The Conference had before them a Memorandum by Sir John Bradbury entitled &quot;Defence of the Realm. Regulr tions41D and&apos;30F and Customs Prohibition of Import,of Securities.&apos;- (import (21) Proclamation).&quot; (Appendix).. -MR.-.CHAMBERLAIN said that&apos;until recently the-Government had been artificially maintaining foreign . exchanges.    Ashort&apos; time ago they had ceased,that and allowed them to lapse,.    In the Home.market they had also imposed certain restrictions, with the object of increasing investment in Government securities;in . connection with the policy of continuous borrowing on National War Bonds. .   These reetrlet ions on the Home market included a prohibition on the Banks to pay more than 3 Pftr cent, on deposits, while on the other hand.
- 2 ** 22 c)to prevent money rates falling away altogether, the Bank of -England allowed the    fKstoafc     Stock Banks 3 par cent, on deposits subject to 3, days notica.   The Victory Loan had realist.(ajuiwft. i-roai,Denversions ) JS570 millions in stock, which included  100 millions furnished by the Banks.   How that the Loan was out of the way, the question arose aa to whether to remove thefollowing--, restrictions.- .(i) . The prohibition upon Stock Exchange dealings in securities not in physical poeaebBion:(li)   The prohibition Of import of securities into this country:(iii)&apos; The prohibition of new issues here for capital purposes abroad:and(iv)- The prohibition of the remittance of money abroad for investment:The Governor of the Bank was anxious to release theJoint Stock Banks from the undertaking not to pay more than 3 p-r cent, on deposits.1 R. BONAR LAW asked whether the temptation to buy American securities .teas not destroyed by the loss on exchange in sending, the -capital to America?SIR JOHN BRADBURY pointed out that.,an extreme case of this was that of the- 5 P^r cent. Angld-Erench Loan in America^.which was now quoted on the New York $stock Exchange at 97 /B, which, at.its present quotation gave a fcield of nearly 8 per cent.   The Exchange barrier would only act if people thought that the exchange had reached, bottom..,Iffl.. BONAR LAW pointed.out that the   t&amp;yer of American securities, would - start with 12 psr cent.. againsthinSIR JOHN BRADBURY said that, in the case of short date securities this apparent loss would bers?tprere unless the Exchange rose in the meantime, when the securities matured for payment, while, if the., exchange were even lower then it would be converted into a profit. The volume of the Anglo-..French Loan, if largely bought, was its&amp;lf sufficient to break the exchange.
22S-3-*In reply to the Prime Minister, he said that Government purchases for food, &amp;c., were being made more and more on the commercial exchange.   Some commodities were however still&quot; being bought out of United States Government credits * PRIME MIHJSTLR pointed out th*t, in. this case, the exchange had not really been allowed to lapse.Sift JOHN BRADBURY said that we rare at the transition point.     Last year purchases had been made mainly on the credit, and this year we were trying to pass f r^m the credit to the exchange., MR. CHAMBERLAIN said that fundamentally the question was a3 to Whether the Government should aim at deflation of the currency.    He agreed that a sudden deflation v,ould be dis-astrcus.    This, however, was not possible, and the Treasury were net attempting it.  fhat they were nov aiming at m&amp; to stop &quot;further inflation.    For this purpose, SI?-John Bradbury proposed * gradual covering of Bank of England Notes as a step tovards deflation.SIR JOHN BRADBURY explained that the object of his plan was rather to check the expansion of the currency note issue,MR. BONAR LAV expressed doubts as to the expediency of doing anything at the present time.MR&quot;. ChA3BERLAIN said he -could see no object in waiting.MR. BONAR LA&apos; said that,, with&apos;so many things&apos; in a catastrophic condition, he did hot v:ant to precipitate any sudden   slump in the American exchanges.-THE PRIME MINISTER&apos; said that,- on, the previous day, he had seen Mr. Rupert&apos;Beckett, -vho had urged very strongly tha the Government ou^ht to take steps to prevent the financial arrangements from hiding the real facts-,- as is at present the case,-    He had urged the importance of getting down to
2Z7realities.   Ftr his part, he was glad that the American Exchange was being allowed to reach its natural&apos;level.MR. CHAMBERLAIN said that Mr.. Gaspard Farrer, the Chairman of the Committee on New *\sues, was of opirtfun that there was not much lending of money to go to Foreign Countries.   Most of the financial propusal^ were f*r ex-rpenditure within the Empire, the greater part,the issue being payable in the Mother Country,, cr else for the object cf protecting existing concerns and not for starting new project-ects* THE PRIME MINISTER asked if .it was desired to withdraw the restrictions on investments abroad ?&apos;.&apos; &apos;. -SIR JOHN BRADBURY said that the restrictions on raising money for enterprises at home had been removed, but that a licence was still required for enterprises abroad even when the money ^es tc be expended in this country for such pur^ poses as railway equipment for export.9PHE PRIME MINISTER asked how the question stood as regards loans abroad to, say, Koltchak or to. the Roumanian Government?^mr.. CHAMBERLAIN and SIR JOHN BRADBURY explained that,, in the case of an application by Koltchak or the Roumanian Gov-ernment, the representatives, of the firm Concerned woujcl al* most certainly come to the Treasury and ask what, the Govern-ment view of the matter was.   In the case of. capital issues required for an Argentine railway, for example, the prtdeeds of --liich would mainly be spent on rails or locomotives in this country, a licence would at present  e required, but woulc certainly be granted.SIR JOHN BRADBURY mentioned that permission had been given to the Poles to raise money, but nothing had happened, . as the City was \rery nervous in regard to transactions of this kind i&quot;ith Governments whose financial stability was uncertain.THE PRIME MINISTER said he hnd heard that the French-were raising a gc*od deal of money in England privately.
&apos;    228SIR JOHN BRADBURY Bald&apos; the. amount&apos; of ^horWata? credits now being arranred was considerable.MR. CHAiuB;,.iLAIr&apos; said that if it hod hot been n:iven the French would have come to the Government, which was very undesirable.   It was better to send the French on to tho market.SIR journey-L&apos; BRADBURY explained that French money was being borrowed in the form of short credits on bills.   It was a very dangerous form of borrowing and one day the Government might find themselves confronted by the City for assistance.   He would much sooner see French borrowings effected by means of lons-term loans.TIE Pili:&apos;&apos;E MIFISTO expressed doubts as to whether it was expedient to permit these loans.LORD asked if the proceeds of the French Loans.,were to be spent in this country ?SIR JOHN BRAr-BURY said this was very largely the case, hut even so it v/as better to have Ion?-date loans than short credits,MR. CHAl&quot;:;EuLAIH said he had refused to allow a foreign loan until,hlo own loan was out of the way,THE PRi: I !. HISTrR thou-ht it made a great difference if the money was spent in this countr^.SIR JOES BRAPIURY pointed out that even this had its disadvantages, since we had to purchase and pay for the raw materials in America,KR. OKA; BERLAIS said the difficulty was that the present hifdi prices   of commodities made it difficult for bur people to trade in solvent markets, in which category he included Scandinavia, Spain and South America,   Consequently, our traders, were looklnr for markets.in countries like Czechoslovakia and Poland, which were not solvent.SIR J0HTf BRADBURY said that one point which required
attention was that vie had been forced to admit German-owned sterling securities to be sold in t---e United Kingdom in order to finance the Gorman food supply.   In the face -of this it would be very difficult not to permit the sale of those help&apos;&quot; in our own Dominions and in Allied countries. Hence, it seemed essential that the restriction on dealings in securities not in physical possession should be removediMR. BOWAR&apos; LA?Jr,.,ihourht there was a difference between the purchase of foreign securities and that of new issues. In most cases the former were not known to the public, but tho latter mi lit attract a ^ood deal of money that otherwise would not leave the country,THE PRI^rlf-JHIST^R asked what the views of the Governor of the Bank were&apos; on the proposed removal of restrictions ?SIR *TOHi,BRADBURY said he had shown him the draft of his Memorandumj and the Governor had agreed.   Later, however, he had suggested that it would be better to postpone their removal until the 3 months Treasury Bill Rate had reached at least 4 per cent,MR, :&apos;CBA1&apos;SERI4I$ pointed out that the Governor of the Bank had always wanted to put up the rates of Treasury Bills.SIR JDHH BRADBURY said that he understood Lord Cunliffe was in favour of getting rid of the restrictions, He rlso wanted the Capital Isst,e&amp; Committee to be wound up.MR. CHAMBERLAilK said that the whole Committee desired this.   As a matter of fact, they practically allowed all applications to pass.SIR JOHH BRADBURY said that the existence of the Committee mifht perhapo keep out some applications.   The question! at issue here was really as to whether the restric-tions were to be repealed or v.erc to be allowed to petor out,THE PRIRE! !!minister TVR asked what was gained by taking off their restrictions at the present moment ?
* 2t 3 sir JOHN BRADBURY aai&amp; that-&apos;at Xoaat-^hlngwafl lost, because the restrictions were rapidly becoming inoperative,   The advantages were to remove the grievance of people who were scrupulous enough to observe the restrictions but car; others who were ignoring them making larr,e profits^  From the point of view of substantial results he did not attach very great importance to their removal, because in substanco they were already becoming increasingly ineffective.MR. BONAR LA;/ suggested that the Only advantages were :*Ci)   To get rid of complaints, and(11)   To get things more rapidly to their natural economic basis.The disadvantage was that the removal of the restrictions would facilitate the Investment of capital in rotten concerns.SIR JOKil BRADtrijRy suggested that the Committee was at present only a bo^ey, which&apos;was every day beooming less effective.   The Committee would every day tend to let more and. more applications through.flf;, CB.AIIB: RLAir said that, in answering Mr, Farrer,, he could perhaps stiffen up the Committee for a time by setting forth, the objections to allowing all applications.THE PRIIE MINISTER suggested that at the same time Mr, Chamberlain might Insist, to some extent, on the importance of imposing the condition that machinery, rails, locomotives, &amp;c*, should be ordered in this country.   Such restrictions could not possibly have been enforced before the war, but as the machinery was in operation^ it might perhaps be ttsed for this purpose.112. CEAi.!3EuLAHv said there were two aspects of the question(1)   The e:rport of capital, and(li)   New issues of capital, part of which was to be spent in this country and exported.
if)-    231(11) could be controlled, but (i) could not.CHAITj RLAIN summed up the conclusions as follows :-wav f(i)   Control should be maintained, for the present, over issue for capital purposes outside the United Kingdom:(ii)   All the other restrictions should be removed, namely j-On the Bankers&apos; deposit rate: On the import of securities: On Stock Exchange dealings in non-physical-possession securities: (d)   On remittances for capital purposes abroad.Theso^ conclusions were accepted^MUTUAL PRE- (2)   MR. CHAMBERLAIN said that, under the PeaceWAR INDEB-TEBNESS BE- Terras, the Government had the right, if they chose, to make f,/EE&apos;i, GRLATBRITAIN AND the Enemy Governmentundertake responsibility for the pre-GERMANY,war debts of enemy subjects to British subjects, the British Government making themselves responsible for the pre-war debts of British subjects to enemy subjects, the arrangement being settled between the Governments by the establishment of a Clearing-House.   The Government could not undertake this rnless thoyvare satisfied that the debts due to British subjects would be paid in full.   In the case of Germany, there was every probability that they would bo paid, but this did not apply in the case of Austria, Bulgaria or Turkey.   The Board of Trade,, however, felt doubtful as to whether they oumht to proceed with this arrangement without obtaining a guarantee by Parliament.SIR AUCKLAND OSDUES said it was difficult to&apos; start paying the first man who made a claim unless the Government were sure that they would be able to pay the last man.I.R. CHAMBErX^IH said the only thing that brought in &quot;an element of doubt as to whether the Government would be paid by Germany was that one of the German assets consisted in German-ownod American securities, and someone had raised the question as to v:hether the Americans would recognise their transfer to British ownership as valid.   He,
himself, however, did not see how they could decline torecognise the transfer.It was agreed :-(i)   That in the case of Germany, theTreasury should, authorise the Board of Trade to proceed on the assumption, that the scheme would he solvent and pay claima as proved in full,(11) That the scheme should not he adopted in the case of any enemy country except Germany, the options in the other treaties being allowed to lapse.GS, whitehall Gardens, S July 24, 1919.
A r F E II D I X. Chancellor trf the Exchequer.Defence of the Realm Regulations 41D and 30F and Customs prohibition cf import of Securities.. (Import (21) proclamation).Now that the Funding Loan is,out of the way it is necessary that an early decision should be taken, as to cur future policy in regard to the restrictions which we have since the outbreak of war and more particularly during the last eighteen months sought, to impose on the export of capital with a view to protecting the Foreign Exchanges.The first of these in point of time was (l) the prohibition-bitionupon Stock Exchange dealings in non-physical-possession securities.-  This prohibition was re-inforced at a later date by (2) the prohibition of import of securities into this country, (3) the-prohibition, of new issues here for, capital purposes abroad,and (4) the prohibition of the remittance of money abroad for investment *These restrictions all form part of &amp; single policy via, that of compelling liquid capital to remain in this country for financing the war and reconstruction hotwith-standing that superior inducements may be offered for its employment abroad and- of preventing the damage which would otherwise be done to the Foreign Exchanges by adding to the burden of an adverse trade balance the burden of remit-tances from the United Kingdom to Foreign countries for the purposes of investment.There can be no doubt that at any rate until quite lately these prohibitions have been made sufficiently effec-tive to secure the main purposes which we had in view.   We have ween able to maintain a greater volume of credit in* flation in this country than would have been possible, had free remittance abroad been permitted,, without a much more serious break in the American and neutral Exchanges and as a consequence we have been able to keep our money rate3 well below the point to which they would necessarily have risen had such inflation not taken place, and thus to facilitate Government borrowing.-If it were possible to maintain these restrictions in effective operation there would be a good deal to be aaid for the-continuance of this policy, objectionable as it is on all grounds of economic theory,, for some time longer, but the&apos; truth is that we have now reached a point at which it can no longer be effectively administered.The prohibitions of remittances from this country for investment abroad and of the import into this country of securities held abroad depended for their enforcement on the postal and cable censorships.-  Mow these-have been removed there will certainly be a sufficiently large number of people who will evade- the- prohibitions&apos; to- make it quite impossible to maintain them to the-detriment of the more scrupulous. Indeed, it is not improbable that the volume- of transactions evading the -restrict! one will&apos; be large enough by themselves to create the very- conditions which the restrictions aim at preventing.-
&quot;   23$M    %    MMAs regards issues in VcA% country for capital purposes abroad the now Capital Issued Ooinmittoo have Ivv&quot;: before them applications for issues to the amount of &amp;H:lt ndll*oas involving actual expondituro outside the United Kingtioa to the amount of 15 millions, out of which thoy have only soeni&amp;oir way to refusing 11 millions and 5$ millions respectively, and I understand that the Chairman of both panels are about to write to us t^ suggest that the Committee should be dissolved and the regulation rescinded  on the ground that it is impossible to enforce it to any useful pur-pose.    Demands aro coining forward for raising large amounts of cap-Ital in this country for tho rocoastruction of the war stricken areas in Europe and as a basis for tho creation of long credits for finaiROBg/bho British export Trade to those areas.   In so far as those demands involve Issuoa upon which tho Capital Issues Gommittoo would have to adjudicate it is highly probable regard being had to tho policy now boing followed by the Committoe that a very high peroontago of them will bo granted, while in so far as thoy intolTo issues by Foreign states in regard to which the Government will haro to adjudicate it is pretty clear that considerable amounts will have to be allowed on grounds of international policy,As regards the question of the sale here of Foreign held securities we have already beon forood to admit German *vmod sterling aocuritioa  to bo sold in tho United ICLngdom in ordor to finance the German Jfood Supply and in the face of this it will ho very difficult to maintain tho prohibition against our own Dominions and Allied countries,lay attempt to maintain the prohibitions will be loortain to create sorious dissatisfaction in iaxllament and I am satisfied that oven if tho attempt is made tho rapidly widening exceptions which we sh..dl be farced to grant will make the restrictions quite ineffoctlve for the purposes in view. That is to say that sufficient oapital will seek remittance abroad either to break the neutral Exchanges or to compel such raising of money ratos and rostriotion of credit here as to make tho oontinuanoo of the process unprofitable,I am therefore in favour of the immediate repeal of Defence of the Realm Regulations 41D and 30F, the removal of tho Customs Prohibition on the Import of securities and the abolition of ail restrictions on dealings in securities which have not boon In continuous physical possession in the United Kingdom since the 30th September I914ftThe recent &quot;slump&quot; in tho umoriceji and neutral Exchangee (which has probably not yet by any moans exhausted itself makes this in my opinion not an unfavourable moment for abolishing tho restrictions, since it will operation to dis-courage remittances from this country for the purchase of securities from ,.raerica and neutral countries and to encourage American and neutral countries to abosrb socuritits from other Allied countries which vould othorwise go to our market. On tho other hand it is -ossiblo that if wo do remove the restrictions now the farther fall in tho ^uerican and neutral Exchanges which will probably take place in any case would be largely attributed to the removal and ve shall become tne subjoct of criticism accordingly.    This    no doubt a ser.lQU8 political objection to the course I propose.\
235-3-Whetfrer the restrictions are removed or net and more particularly if they are removed, I think it is essential that immediate steps.should be taken to erect the proper economic barrier&apos; -gainst the outflow of. capital i.e. to make &apos; its employment at home more remunerative than its removal abroad,^due-regard of course being had t^ questions of relative security.If ).*&amp;.&apos;leave&apos; things alone a sort of equilibrium will no. doubt ultimately be reached by means of the adjustment of the Exchanges but only at the expense of such depreciation of our American and neutral Exchanges as Pill dislocate our whole national economy and jeopardise our Fedct Supply. -The only alternative to this which I can see is to increase the inducements of capital to stay at home and as a. consequence to offer further inducement td American and   , other Foreign capital to come here.   This means higheh money rates in t la country and a Jail in the market value Of securities.   This will have to come sooner or 2 ter and I am strongly of epinion that we are now at&apos; the parting of the ways and that the sooner it comes the better.   Se long as we have cheap money here and securities at an artificial valur relatively to the ^orld supply and demand for capital we shall never get it into the,head of the community generally that we are not in a position io create large credits in favour of insolvent customers and until this is realised we shall never get prices down to the level at whieh it is possible to trade with solvent customers.I fully realise&apos;the impossibility from the political point of view of &quot;the Government putting up money rates against itself&quot; butI think public opinion is now ripe for taking the initial step towards restoring sound currency in accordance with the:recommendation of the cunliffe Committee.I would therefore suggest that concurrently with the repeal of the restrictions we&apos; should initiate the policy of earmarking Bank of England notes (not necessarily pound for pound) against any further increases in the currency note circulation.   This will have the effect of depleting the reserve in the Banking Department of the Bank of England and making it necessary for the Bank to take- steps to make the 5$ bank rate effective, such-steps will of course /dry.up the flow of money into Treasury b lIs and put us in the position of having either to increase our ways:and means c borrowing from&apos; the Bank or to raise the Treasury bill rate to 5$..No responsible person would advocate the former alternative and so we should be in the position- of having the higher rates forced upon us as the,result (so far as it is th^ result of Government action at all)&apos; of a very moderate and tentative step in the direction of shecking the further expansion of the currency note issue ,a measure&apos; which ^luacst everybody now Relieves to be a matter of urgent necessity.It is true of course: that the.findings cf the Cunliffe Committee have not been received withuniversal approval, but I do not think that any responsible critic has found \. fauli with the principle&apos; of this particUAar recommendation.-
Tho Committees ohief critic a in the banking world are Sir Edward Holden and Mr* Goodenough each of when has hie own scheme for currency reform.  Sir Edward Holden ia anxious that a gold reserve should be accumulated as soon as possible against the currency notes of an amount equal to the total circulation.-   The Com committee*8 recommendation is in effect a step in this direction since the Bank of England notes earmarked against the currency notes will have to have a  old cover.   The main plank in Mr. Goodenough^s platform of reform is that immediate steps should be taken to stop the further expansion of the currency note issue and In cbnver-organisation with me he has agreed that as a first step the expo-dlent of earmarking Bank of England notes is a sound one.The policy I suggest tfill 1 fear inevitably result in the first instance in a further &quot;slump&quot; in the American and neutral Exchanges followed by a considerable rise in money rates and a considerable fall in the London market prices of long date securities including Government stocks, Indeed unless it produces these results it will be ineffective.The 5 &apos; Anglo French Loan in America which falls due for repayment at par en the 15th October 1920 ia now quoted on the Hew York Stock Exchange at 97 l/3th giving a yield of nearly 0 V Wo doubt in this particular case the effect of removing the embargo ou-remittances abroad for the purposes of investment will be &amp;hat purchases from this side will r&amp;pld-ly send up the price to the neighbourhood of par or the dollar exchange down to a point, lower than the general expectation of the rate likely to prevail at the due data of the loan/ (in which base a purchase would be too hazardous an Exchange gamble).   But there are many other, though perhaps not such extreme eases of securities in America showing very attractive yields to a British investor at present quotations and a good deal of levelling by means of American rijea and British falls will be necessary before working equilibriv-1 is established. The fall of the American Exchange as I have already indicated will probably not operate to cheek this proofs3 until there is a general impression that lt has touched bottom,, A3 soon, however, as this point is reached it is not improbable that the tide of investment will turn the other way.Tho policy, if adopted, must I think be persisted in to the point necessary to check the expansion of, and possibly produce a moderate amount of contraction in, the currency note issue and to stabilise American and neutral ^xoh-^/^s at or near the points which may appear to represent their natural level . after they have, passed through the first shoe&apos;&apos; of freeing re* mittanoes.   These points will probably be appreciably below the present quotations.Any attempt to effect a drastic reduction in the present amount of the currency note circulation or to bring the American and neutral Exchanges back to par in the immediate&quot;future would in my opinion have&apos; disastrous consequences, but if t^e policy is applied only to the moderate extent which I.have suggested I think it will be possible to *hefVk our progress on the &quot;ovm
grade and even to start to move on the up grade without putting monoy rates upon a level which would causo any serious embarrassment to the revival of industry,On tho other hand the policy undoubtedly means a very considerable addition, though only I believe for a  comparatively short period, to the interest charges in respect of the floating debt.     It aiso probably moans-&apos;a depreciation (of what percentage , \ it is impossible to forecast) in the market pricos of our long date loans including those just issued; % postponement for tho time boing of any further funding operations and great difficulty in raising new capital for housing and other reconstruction .se*nricos both by local authorities and by the (Treasury,As regards this last point, howovor, I am very doubtful whether tho raising of such Oapital will in fact be practicable oven if wo continue tho policy of financial drift and if it is agreed that a postponement is necessary until moro stable conditions have boon established it follows that the sooner stops are taken to establish such conditions the soonor will it be possible to proceed with thoso necessary works^c
