7    - document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;CONFIDENTIAL.01497529WAR CABINET.BY MAJOR-GENERAL  HOLMAN ON south russia.CIRCULATED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.The Secretary, .The War Office,London, S.W. Ekaterinodar,10th July, 1919.1. I have not yet had time to prepare a full report on the reaction of political questions on the military situation, but I consider it necessary to draw attention without is delay to a matter which is of great and immediate military importance, i.e., the taking of decisions by His Majesty&apos;s Government before giving General Denikin a chance of presenting his case, and the communication of orders based on these decisions to the Trans-Caucasian Governments before they are communicated to General Denikin.2. An example has recently occurred of this lack of co-ordination. General Briggs&apos;.s appreciation of the so-called North Caucasus Republican Government was given in his telegram, No. G.G. 297 of 13th April, which ended as follows : &quot;I trust that His Majesty&apos;s Government will now decisively reject fantastic claims of Chermoev and similar political adventurers.&quot;3. General Briggss action was approved of by General Milne (vide his No. I. 5604 of 18th April), whose concurrence with General Briggs&apos;s report was further shown by his, telegram No. I. 5851 of 9th May, which marked his disapprobation of a communica-tion made by the Officer Commanding Troops, Petrovsk, to the North Caucasus Government.4, General Denikins policy was to conciliate the stable representative elements of Daghestan and induce them to come into line with the other hill tribes who had accepted the form of tribal self-government under the Governor-General of Terek and Daghestan which he had offered them.He believed, after General Milne&apos;s visit in the end of April, that he had in this the support and approbation of His Majesty&apos;s Government, who were aware of the immediate success of this policy with the other mountain tribes. It was, therefore; a great shock to him to learn of the laying down of yet another line, persistence in which would mean the abandonment of the stable anti-Bolshevik elements of Daghestan who had rallied to him.5. Genera] Milne was directed (vide telegram No. 78690 of 6th June, a copy of which was afterwards sent me marked &quot; for your personal information only&quot;), to inform General Denikin of the proposed line unless he had any serious objection, but, in repeating the gist of these instructions to me he commenced his telegram, No. 6182 of 8th June : &quot; In accordance with instructions received from &apos; Troopers,&apos; you are to inform General Denikin . . . .&quot; Unfortunately the telegram was not received by me till 15th June, though sent &quot; Clear the line.&quot; I have since learnt that the instructions to the 27th Division were sent &quot; priority,&quot; but they must have reached Tiflis several days earlier as, before they reached me, General Denikin had already complained that the officer commanding the Russian troops at Petrovsk had received following telegram from the Officer Commanding British Troops at the same place: &quot; Please transmit the following to General Dratzenko : In accordance with the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government&quot; affecting the. affairs of the Volunteer Army, the troops of the Volunteer Army must remain behind a line which commences 5 miles south of Petrovsk and thence runs parallel to the Grozny Railway to and along the frontier of Daghestan, and then along the frontier of Daghestan, and then along the frontier of the Tiflis Government.&quot;\     (B19/355)   70   8/19  HAS   7380wo
6. The misunderstanding has thus been increased by badness of communications,, but I think that the system of political control needs alteration.7. In this case it was owing to the uncertainty of the nature and extent of Italian action in Trans-Caucasia that His Majesty&apos;s Government considered it necessary to lay-down another line, South of which General Denikin&apos;s troops should not go. The chief argument which was used with General Denikin, when His Majesty&apos;s Government first required him to observe the original line laid down and to endeavour to maintain friendly relations with the Trans-Caucasian States, was that the presence of British troops ensured his rear.8. British troops and naval personnel are being withdrawn, operations at Astrakhan and communication with the Ural Cossacks render General Denikufs occupation of the Petrovsk Derbent railway increasingly important, the&apos; gang of adventurers who claimed to be the Government of the North Caucasus Republic have disappeared, and General Denikin&apos;s representative and troops have been invited into Daghestan by the saner anti-Bolshevik elements of the tribes.9. The sole facts calling for further restrictions of General Denikin s efforts to restore order in a portion of Ciscaucasia, so as to free himself from embarrassments in his rear and provide another contingent for the capture of Astrakhan, was the fear of the Azerbaijan Government that General Denikin had designs on the independence of that country. These fears are fostered by elements who are hostile to us and are working, not to bring peace in the Caucasus, but disunion.10. General Denikin has already asked us to communicate to the Azerbaijan Government his acknowledgment of their independence, but, unfortunately, as this declaration was coupled with the undertaking not to cross the southern frontier of Daghestan, provided the Azerbaijan troops did not undertake hostilities, it was not communicated to the Azerbaijan Government by the 27th Division.11. The Trans-Caucasian States, having been informed officially that General Denikin had orders to withdraw to the new line, will doubtless, when this is found impracticable, use his failure to comply as an excuse for themselves not complying with the instructions of His Majesty&apos;s Government.. The case is analogous to that of Sochi, where the General Officer Commanding, 27th Division, without any reference to General Denikin or this Mission, gave the Georgian Government an undertaking that General Denikin would not advance in the Black Sea Province.12. These misunderstandings are due to lack of co-ordination of political control, and I venture to suggest that it is essential, more especially as new factors will be introduced with the Italians, to appoint a sole British political representative for the Caucasus and South Russia. Such a representative, by personal dealings with the Trans-Caucasian States and General Denikin, would be able to ensure that Caucasian problems should be dealt with as a whole, and should see that the interests of those Russians whom His Majesty&apos;s Government are supporting in their efforts to establish a stable representative Government in Russia and prevent the spread of Bolshevism into A sia should not be allowed to suffer from the unfounded fears of the Tran-Csaucasian States that General Denikin has designs on their independence.I have the honour, &amp;c,(Signed)   H. C. HOLMAN, Major-General, Commanding British Military Mission, South Bussia.
