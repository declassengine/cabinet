(THIS DOCUMENT? IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANRIC RAJEBTY,C: GOVERNMENT).I note that a paper, G.T.7839 Secret, was circulated to the War Cabinet yesterday, purporting to he the trans-lation-of a letter from the President of the Portuguese Republic to the Prime Minister, dated July 23rd, on the subject of the presence of King ttanoel of Portugal at the Peace Celebrations on July 19th last.   This letter is not from the President of the Portuguese Republic but from Senhor Bernardino Machado,, who was President until the autumn of 191*7..   He was arrested on his return from a visit to this country, was deposed from the Presidency, and exiled.   He then proceeded to Spain and later to Paris, and addressed communications to The King and to Kr* Lloyd George protesting against the recognition as President of Senhor Paes by His Majesty&apos;s Government.   In February last he formally surrendered the Mandate of Presidency, and as a&apos; result of this the decree of banishment passed by Senhor Paes against him has been annulled by the present Government.Sehhor Ilachado has, however., no official position whatsoever and no status to justify him in addressing his present protest, to which it is unnecessary to make any reply.It is, I think, known to my colleagues that the position assigned to to&apos; King Manoel on the dais was in no sense designed, but was the result of an unfortunate mistake 6n the part of a Court Official.I should not have been surprised had a representation o^ protest been received from the Portuguese Charge- l^Affaires in London,   This, however, has not taken place, and Senhor Haehadols intervention is really an impertinence.G. T. 7855.SECRET.CABINETREPRESENTATIONS OP THE PORTUGUESE REPUBLIC AT THE PEACE CELEBRATIONS IN LONDON ON JULY19th,1919.Note by Lord Curzon with reference to Paper G.T.. 7839.(Signed) C. of Ko2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1. July 31st, 1919.
