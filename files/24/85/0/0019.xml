Secret.- Afghanistan. Following from Grant, Rawalpindi :-uLast night I received letter from Chief Afghan delegate complaining of memorandum, regarding restrictions to be placed on their movements, &amp;c. &apos; I did not reply, intending to explain matter to delegates at meeting to-day. This morning Nawab Mania Baksh called on them to arrange details of their coming to meeting. We found them in state of great excitement regarding (corrupt group), especially Ali Ahmed who eventually told him that they would not attend meeting to-day unless restrictions were modified. I sent Mania Baksh back with verbal message (agreement) to effect that if Afghans did not attend meeting to-day I should arrange for their immediate return to Afghanistan and that hostilities would be resumed as soon as they crossed border. This apparently sober (corrupt group) and Maula Baksh returned with message that they would attend meeting if I would assure them that no indignity was intended by restrictions. 1 wrote to say that restrictions were authoritative and in accordance with international usage in such circumstances, that no indignity whatever was intended and that I looked forward to see Afghan delegates as soon as (corrupt group) arrives,&quot; Afghan delegates arrived to (corrupt group) meeting 11.-15 hours.&apos;1
