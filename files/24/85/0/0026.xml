TglS SSfflMSS ^ JSB PROPERTY OF HIS SKITApiC JMffiSQyTS aOTOMMT/\    275WAR   CABIJEJ . u ctSECRET. 16&apos;THE OOAIi COMMISSION REPORTS. .&amp;.T.7886. ;Mote by Mr.G.H.Barnes.I have read all the above, and I find that the whole of the Commissioners are agreed only on two things. , Pirst, that there should, be increased output of coal, and second, that it is impossible to get it under the present system.   What has to be decided is, under what system can we get this inoreased output which is so necessary for the maintenance of the industries upon which the prosperity of the country depends?    The controversy seems likely to range around the question of nationalisation. Theoretically, I believe in nationalisation of monopolies.   If I thought vie should get greater goodwill, increased efficiency, and therefore greater output of coal per man under a system of national-isation, I should support it.   It is no argument against nationali-sation to say that it would remove incentive on the part of the owners, because,, as a matter of faot, private ownership has prac-tically eliminated incentive on the part of the men.   I think it is more important to get incentive on the part of the actual produce-cer than on the part of the owner.   I have grave douibts, however, if we can get it by nationalisation.   The men have &quot;been deluded into belief that their interests are necessarily opposed to the interests, not only of the owners, but of the State; and although that might disappear in the course of time under nationalisation, I see no prospect of it disappearning in the imme&amp;iatu future,   for that reason, I should not be disposed to risk nationalising all the mines; but I should be disposed to commit qurselvee to the principle of nationalisation, and to adopt some method of experiment ) on e sufficiently large scale to be a guide, but not on so large a ;oale as to involve us in disaster if it should fail.   Sir Arthur Duckh&amp;m puts forward a report which is at least interesting and suggestive.   He would divide up into 13 areas, amalgamate the interests in each of them, guarantee 4$ to those interests (with a possible 6f0) and nationalise any one group, if the 4$ failed to
i    276tbe produced end had to be made up in four suoo^selve-years out of seven.   A fatal objection to the last suggestion seomar to me to be that the men, if they Itnew that nationalisation was only t6 come by reducing output, might be inclined to reduce it. But in the meantime, the nation would suffer.   Why not Adopt Sir Arthur Duckhan^s proposal of IS groups and nationalise one of them?   Both nationalised (and un-nationalised mines might be put under unified control with all the benefits to be derived therefrom; but the bulk of them would remain under the Duckham schomei   That is the direction in which I should be disposed to go I should buy out the minerals, set up joint control, and at the same time promise nationalisation of a group atbthe end of three years.   The arrangement with the men might include, and 1 think should include, over the whole area some provision against sudoen stoppage.   But there might be a differentiation in regard to these conditions, as between the nationalised and unnationalised areas.   The men in the nationalised area should agree to work until discussion of any disputes had takon place locally and nationally, and I am not sure but what they should also be asked to furtBr agree to some arbitration in the event of failure to agree after such local and national discussion.   The men in the unnationalised areas might be loft their freedom to strike if thoy thought proper after discussion locally.Our difficulty is the keen feeling there is on both sides in regard to nationalisation.   We cannot satisfy both; but if we came down solidly and firmly in favour of experimentation, we could satisfy ourselves at all events that we had done the right thing, anc&quot; gone as far as the tremendous interests involved would justify us in going.(Initialled) G.N.B.2,Whitehall Gar dona, S.V7.1 39th July 1919.
