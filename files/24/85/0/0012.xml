fux cultivation in inland1..^M?DUM BY T&amp;i JM1MT OP THjw uOAHD OF TRAM. &apos;iNV^vy&apos; The empire Flax Growing Committee established by the -&quot;&quot;Board of Trade have put forward schemes for the encouragement of flax-growing- in the South of Ireland, which involve flax growing on a unit of at least 1,000 acres and Government support of a kind similar tc that given in the case of the scheme of the Flax Society Limited&quot;in the North of Ireland.Very considerable importance is attached to these schemes because it is very desiraole that the experimental work which . has been carried on under Government auspices in JSnglarid, Scotland and the North of Ireland during&apos; the war for the development of domestic flax supplies should be extended to the South of Ireland where it is&quot;believed that there is every prospect of success for the flax growing industry.The first scheme is promoted by the Fibre Corporation Limited, a oomoany which &quot;has for some time been carrying on flax growing mainly in the North of Ireland but partly also in the South, on distinctive lines.   30,000 would bo required to cover the cost of erecting a factory and  50,000 for working capital.   It is proposed that the whole funds necessary will be borrowed by the Fibre Corporation as required from a Bank under a Government guarantee.  In the event oi any profit being earned one-third would go to the Fibre Corporation, which would place at the disposal of the new company &quot;the whole of its processes and superintend and carry out the working of them, and two-thirds to the Government.The second proposal, which is promoted by a Syndicate composed mainly of persons interested in the only flax spinning company in tho South of Ireland (at Cork), involves an expenditure of about  75,000 of which it is proposed that the first  15.000 would be put up bv the Syndicate and the remainder up to a maximum of ^60,000 woula be obtained on a loan&apos;,under Government guarantee.  Any profit earned would be divided as in the first case.The Government guarantee suggested would in each case be for five years and at the end of that time the promoters would have the right to purchase the buildings and machinery at one-half the cost-price.   Therewould be a&quot;Government Director on each undertaking with special powers as to the control of expenditure.%e Empire Flax Growing -Committee state that in view of; the &quot; experience which has been gained in the schemes carries! on in the North of Ireland under Government auspices, there is evesy prospect of commercial success and in tba* event the Committee believe that they will lead to a much larger development of the flax growing industry in the South of Ireland, which will contribute very materially towards placing the linen industry in a much more secure position than1is at present tho case in . respect of tho supplies of its row material, but the schemes m must for the time being be regarded primarily as experiments on a commercial scale in improved methods of flax production, and in the economic development of Ireland.1 should be glad if the sanction of the Cabinet could be given to these proposals subject to the settlement of details in consultation with the Treasury,&apos; .A.C Gj?I)L\sS. 6. 7. 19.
