Tne effects of the drought are more marked in northern than in southern counties, the sowing season being somewhat later in the north.   Light gravelly soils will, however, everywhere produce rather light crops of corn and potatoes.Cutting and saving of hay is far advance^ in most districts, and the excellent quality of the produce is everywhere commented on.   A considerably increased acreage of hay in County30/7/19,
Antrim is being reserved this year flor the saving of seed.Reports regardin^j^ei^eaXa are--iw^ -those of previous--weeks.   The oat crop promisosx&amp;: fair yield cf grain-azjexoept on very dry   soils, but the straw will be short. The yield of barley and of winter wheat is expected to &quot;be up to average.   Potatoes made fair progress during the week, though in many places the growth of foliage is less than normal^ and if the drought continues the crop will ripen prematurely and the yield will be low.   Early crops are yielding well but are L^j, ripening off rapidly.   Potato blight is in evidence on many farms but it has not^ caused serious damage exoept in a limited number of fields in western counties.  ,Spraying is being oarried Out. extensively, though there are still to be found farmers whe\ neglect this safeguard.Mangels and turnifis are uneven.
