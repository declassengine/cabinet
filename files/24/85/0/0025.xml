THIS DOCUilSIlT IS THE j?KOH?RTY OJ? FIS BBIMFIC VJ JKtfrs C-OWJ^KT,WAR   C A 3 I K E J . SEOBftfr. THE SITUATION DI RUSSIA.1&amp;.T.7825. Note by Mr.      BarnesThe above subject is one of extreme importance from the Labour point of view..    Our intervention in Russia is represen-ted by the Extremists as counter-revolutionary and as being in-spired by Capitalist motives, c And unfortunately, however stupid this may ap:ear to be to those with knowledge of affairs, working-folk of all shades of opinion believe the Extremists.     That has been so right throughout &quot;the Russian business, and.is increasingly the oase a3 time goes on.     I have celled attention to it several times, end&quot;inc. memo I submitted to my colleagues last December ((t.T.6513), I urged that we should not make any further movement into Hub .ia.   Moreover, I pointed out the clanger of one of our units being overwhelmed there.    Fortunately, that has not occur-red; but we have run ^reat risks.I am glad that we are not taking any further risks in regard to men, other than the risks unfortunately incidental to getting them out.    The passage in the memorandum of the General Staff (G.T.7785) that remains in my mind as a determining one in regard to our further policy is the last passage before the summary of proposals.(p.9.)    It is there said that the choice after this summers campaign will be between doing a great deal more than we have yet done in the past, or terminating ali military effort in Russia.    I am for the latter,   It seems to me that whatever may be the desirability of helping the Russians to secure orderly and representative government, we have to consider if we can undertake to get it for them.   Because that is what it means.    Our exper-ienoe up to now shows that they cannot get it for themselves and not one of our Allies is helping much to get it.    Our intervention in Russia has been on three grounds(1) fighting the Germans,(2) sticking to our friends; and(3) rescuing the Czecho-Slovaks. The Germans have gone, and therefore that justification has gone with them.    I think also we have discharged all moral obligation in regard to our friends.   As-a-jna&amp;teri-jaiLji^^ flarqi tiorft minh - -ffTAepA--miff flpfly^gTn^a, fn pny case we cannot go on indefinitely supporting a movement which gets bigger the longer we are in it.   The more we put in, the more we are expected&apos;to put in.   It is like dropping money down a well; and for my part, I think we ought to come to a halt as soon as ever it would be fair to Denikin to do so.I should let him know that at the end of this summer, he must be left on his own.In regard to the Czecho-Slovaks, they &amp;on1t appear to be very anxious to move.at all.     I should get some information as to what they v/ajtoh, and help them down eastward, which seems to me the only w$y by which they can get out..(Initialled)G.fl.3.2,Whitehall Gardens,S.W.1 39th July 1919.
