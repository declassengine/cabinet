Thio Document is the Property of (/ tiHis gntinnic Majesty&apos;s Government. 409EFFECT OF CONTINUE USE OF NAVAL IM1NGS AS PUMPMEN AT COAL MINES.I Admiralty Memorandum for the tfor Cabinet.The industrial position does not appear to have improved, and there is, I fear, now&quot; a prospect that the state of affairs existing in the North of England may continue for some con-siderable time.In these circumstances, I venture to press for a re-consideration of the policy whioh keeps naval ratings working the pumps in the pits.   Quite apart from the political aspect which a continuance of these men at this work may involve, and which might easily have a most unfortunate result, the naval side of the question must he borne in mindeThese men are now being employed upon work for which they have not entered the service.    Their&quot;absence from their places of duty causes the very gravest inconvenience in the manning situation, and a postponement of the ultimate destination of cur ships abroad.    It also seriously interfereswith the leave which is long overdue - a very serious cause of anxiety both to Officers and men.   The effect oh the men cannot, I fear, be otherwise than injurious.   They find them-selves in contact with men of an unsettled state of mind, even of revolutionary ideas;   and is it not more than probable that, being in a state of anxiety themselves as to their own position, they&quot;may absorb some of these ideas themselves?I would also venture on the menJs behalf to point out that they are not only engaged on work which must be to somo extent at all events distasteful to them, but they are also living in conditions of extreme discomfort, temporary and bad lodgings, groat wear and tear of clothing (this&quot;must of course be put right by us), no proper recreation, and above all. the great effect to which I have referred to above, namely, that they are suffering from the loss of leave which has been due to them for many months, and which has been promised to them.In order that the Cabinet may realise what are some of the responsibilities cast upon the Navy at the present time, I append to this Memorandum a short statement supplied to me by the Naval Staff,    I am sure my colleagues will realise that it is a task of temendous difficulty to carry out the views we all entertain as to demobilisation and economy, and at the same time to discharge the various and pressing duties which fall upon the Navy. &apos;   This statement is only a brief summary; frequent demands are made upon us to send ships to various parts of the British Empire in order to assist the local Government in maintaining order.    These requests must be complied with; and it is obvious that it is impossible to discharge all these duties, and at the same time drastically reduce numbers and expenditure. I I do not ask for any consideration of this latter aspect of the case at the present time; but I think my colleagues ought to have the information in their possession.(Sd.) W.H. LONG.1.8.19.
It is observed that there is a tendency either to forget or to ignore the extent of the duties that are being laid upon the Naval Service, at the present time.  A short Memorandum on the subject may therefore be found to be informative.It is constantly being pointed out that the German Fleet is at the bottom of the sea, and it is implied rather than alleged that it follows that the Navy is at present unemployed and can be cut down immediately to almost any extent that the financial requirements of other Departments may suggest..The following statement shows the present employment and commitments of Naval Forces nominally in Home Waters. It should&apos;be unnecessary to point out that such employment and commitments are in all cases consequent upon the policy adopted by the dear Cabinet for which the Board of Admiralty have no responsibility.In the RAJjTIQ we have a Force operating which con-desists of -6 Light Cruisers 1 Aircraft Carrier 1 Minelayer 24 Destroyers 1 Destroyer Depot Ship 7 Submarines 1 Submarine Depot Ship 6 Minesweepers 8 Coastal Motor Boats.This Force forms the sole protection from aggression by sea of the small States in Northern Russia which wo are supporting, and also of our Military Missions.   It is employed chiefly in stabilising the situation at various Ports.In the YfHITB SEA we have a force operating which consist of -1 Battleship 1 Li $it Cruiser 2 Aircraft Carriers 9 Monitors 6 Gunboats 7 Minesweepers 6 Motor Launches 6 Coastal Motor Boats ( 17 Trawlers7 Auxiliaries, including Oil Ships.The operations in this sphere are absorbing 5,000 Naval personnel, in addition to the actual crews of the ships.The Cabinet in the last few days have called upon the Admiralty to supplement this Force by a battalion of 800 Royal Marines, which&quot; have to be drawn from the Marine Depots on shore, and are being replaced by withdrawing Marines temporarily from the ships of the Fleet of whose complements they form an integral part.In eonnection with the carrying out of the German Armistice and Peace Terms the following ships are engagedAdmiralty MgiBPxMpiiiiiuc^gri-.-tQ  he Etol  0TQ.e.a,,,nQfflinall7..,,inJjomAjgia.
-71 th tha Allied Maya], Irmi^^ 1 Light cruiser and 1 Destroyer.   4 Destroyers aro also engaged on running mails and despatches.li-th the Lilfi&amp;interalliees^ &amp;i Control:  1 Battleship,The Flenshurg Force P provided by decision of the tfar Cabinet, consists of 2 Light Cruisers&apos; and 6 Destroyers/271 vessels are still employed on clearing of the seas from mines.The visit of H.R.H. The Prince of &quot;/ales to Canada and the United States involves the withdrawal of a Battle Cruiser and 2 Light Cruisers for a period of nearly 2 months.The Atlantic and Home Fleets are now at their Home Ports and Portland, and are under orders to give summer leave, which is overdue.530 Officers and Men were recently landed from the Fleet under Cabinet decision to preserve the Coal Mines from destruction,,    In addition, 960 Officers and Men have been sent from the Depots on shore for tho same purpose, making a total Force of about 1,500 men.As already stated, all the Marines of the Fleet have also been landed to&apos; take the place of tho Marine Battalion sent to North Russia.In the event of a strike involving the &quot;Triple Alliance&quot; the Navy is committed to -    10 separate schemes for the protection of the community v/bicn will necessitate the em-ployment of several thousand officers and men out of their ships, and also the employment of many of H,-M, Ships.So far from our Naval forces in Home Waters being adequate to meet without difficulty the services to which, as above stated, they are committed either actually or in the event of a by no means improbable emergency,, the extent of these commitments is delaying the relief of denobilisable men, preventing the commissioning of ships for foreign service , and interfering with the much-needed resumption of the gunnery and other specialist training of young Officers and men.The above remarks refer only to North European Waters, but owing to the unrest and consequent disturbances prevailing all over the world, there are repeated appeals for the presence of &apos;:,:arshipe, many of which cannot be met as the ships assigned to Foreign Stations have in many cases not yet been commissioned.  For example, in the -Test Atlantic there are at the present moment three places where serious dis-turbances are in progress, calling for the presence of H.M. Ships, of which 3 are actually available.   :It is obvious that this exact proportion of dis-turbances to ships may at any moment be upset, and we may find ourselves in a position of being unable to afford the protection of the British Flag ^here&quot;it is demanded.
