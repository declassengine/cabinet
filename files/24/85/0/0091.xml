This Document, is toe Property ofFrom Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India,2nd August 1919.(Received 3rd.)10464.   2nd August;   Malleson telegraphs under No. .D.O. 2018 of 30th j uly : - *&quot;Reports indicate that Bolsheviks in Transcaspia are in panic state of ner- , vousness.   Rumours of disastrous lighting north of Tashkent reach them.   Practically!! all their troops on the Askabad front are now Mahometans of.no military value, and most of them ready to desert.   All flatly refuse to fight British-Indian troops.&quot;2. I think, if authorised it would be worth while to try to bluff them out by my sending them official letter saying, as they menace Persian frontier, they mus t retire at once east of Merv. If they do not we shall attack them from both Krasnovodsk and the Persian sides, and elsewhere.&quot; This letter could be supported by moving another company and squadron, strength of which Avould be greatly magnified by reports to Armenians.&quot; 3. Even if Afghan Peace negotiations break clown it will take some time for Herat to&apos; hear. Meanwhile, for Bolshevik consumption, I am making much of negotiations which have alarmed them.&quot;4. I think experiment worth trying.&quot;2. This proposal does not commend itself to us on account of (a) policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government is opposed to our intervention in Transcaspia; (6) it is mere bluff Avhich, even if temporarily successful, would ultimately lead to choice of alter-natives of furnishing material backing or withdrawal. Of these the former is impracticable, and the latter would, leave Transcaspians and Turcomans once more at mercy of Bolsheviks who, moreover, by that time, might have cleared up Orenburg-situation.3. We ask for your directions in case it is considered such demonstration would assist Denikn^s forces or Ural Cossacks to a degree Avhich would justify risking the drawbacks mentioned above.
