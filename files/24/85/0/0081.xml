This document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government.secret o1221308WAR CABINET.Vision of mechanical and horse transport for emergency duties in case of strikes.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR. I circulate the following Memorandum which has been prepared in the War Office.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.ith August, 1919.In March, 1919, instructions were received from the War Cabinet to organize the Home Forces for dealing with civil disturbances which might arise in the case of a general strike.The measures, to be taken by the War Office involved the provision of 10 horse transport units and 736 motor lorries, in addition to other motor transport, and the employment of personnel to the number of 490 men in respect of the 10 horse transport companies and 1,500 in respect of the mechanical transport.Owing to the exigencies of demobilization and the urgent calls for Royal Army Service Corps personnel from overseas, India, Egypt, &amp;c, it is impossible for the War Office-to meet the requirements detailed above in full.In the case of the horse -transport units, the bulk of the personnel consists of men who are entitled to be demobilized. Their retention is unfair to the men and is giving rise to considerable discontent. Furthermore, retainable personnel which are urgently required elsewhere is being locked up.Moreover, it is a question whether, in the event of the emergency of civil disturbance, this personnel would, particularly if their demobilization is much longer deferred, prove entirely reliable. At the same time, the mere fact of the retention of men who are entitled to be demobilized constitutes a substantial grievance, and may tend in some degree to perpetuate a general atmosphere of unrest.It.is highly desirable, therefore, that these 10 horse transport units should be disbanded.In the case of the mechanical transport vehicles and personnel, the ability of the War Office to meet the demands for 7.36 lorries and the requisite personnel varies from day to d&amp;y. The personnel for these is found by stopping all training at the instructional schools, stopping repairs, convoy work, formation of drafts and new units, and by utilizing every man in the dep6ts who is in course of preparation for posting. The numbers so available naturally vary at different times. e.g., there are more trained drivers available after the completion of an instructional course and just before a draft sails than at the beginning of a course or after the despatch of a draft.In any probable combination of circumstances the War Office will be unable to jneet the liability in full, but the extent of the deficit cannot be forecasted.In these circumstances the War Cabinet are asked to decide whether: (a.) The provision for the emergency can now be dispensed with, or, if not, (b.) The responsibility of the War Office may be restricted to an undertaking to provide as many vehicles and men as are available, without retaining demobilizable men, at the moment of such a contingency arising,) inasmuch as for the reasons given above, the War Office is unable to meet in their &quot; entirety the demands made upon it.
