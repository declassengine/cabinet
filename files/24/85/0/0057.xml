RAMSAY MACDONALD ........................ V 9IRELAND ..................................... &quot; summary ---0O0------The deadlock in the Yorkshire Coalfield oontinues.   The men are reported to-be anxious to return to work, but it is unlikely that they will do so until after the holidays, whatever their leaders may deoide.   The Naval ratings appear, on the whole, to be? on friendly terms with the strikers.   The Managers think that the-necessary repairs will oooupy fourteen days before any ooal oan be^ despatched.No disturbances are likely to occur until the result of the ballot, decided on at the Triple Allianoe Conference, is known. Opinion regarding Nationalisation is not unanimous among the miners, but on the whole it seems likely that there will be a large majority in favour of a strike.The railwaymen and the agricultural workers are disouseing &apos; Nationalisation and inoluding it in their programmes.   The general spirit of unrest has attaoked agricultural labourers as acutely as the other classes of workers.The principle of &quot;direot action&quot; is to be discussed to-day by the Parliamentaiy Labour Party.   There is a large-body of opinion against it, and there are signs of a revolt at Neath and other parts of South Wales against the taotios of the extremists.Housing and the ooat of living are still the prinoipal oauses of disoontent.   They are affecting the temper of disoharged soldiers, as well as other olasses.   Agitators are direoting particular attention to Liverpool.There/
There is evidenoe from all parts of the country ot the need for education in tho elementary eooncmio faota, espeoiei that the only remedy for high prioes is inoreased production and that the present tendenoy of all classes to do less work and olaim more pay is steering the oountry straight fox national ruin.Perhaps the most remarkable symptom of the week is the revolt against the extremists in South Wales.   1%e movement condemnation is reported to be spreading rapidly, and it may have a profound effeot upon English labour generally.
THIS POLICEWhile the support of the Polios Union is weakening in the ranks of the Polios, it is being aotively token up by Labour organizations.   The older Trade Unions support it on ..  the general ground that there should be no legislation against the prihoiple of Unionism, while tho extremists ,,.    quite frankly regard the Union as a means of paralysingsociety when the time oomes for a struggle.  Thus, aooording ;   Q ; to the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, Mr * John Bromley, the Secretary of the Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, has written to tht Prime Minister and the Home Secretary condemning the &quot;bruta^ attaok of the. Government on the Police Union&quot;, and calling upon organized Labour to resist the &quot;direct attaok upon Trade Unionism&quot;.    Tho local Labour Party at Birmingham on July 21st passed a resolution &quot;vehemently protesting against! the tyrannical aotion of the Government in endeavouring, by Act cf Parliament, to crush the National Union of Police an4 Prison Offioialo&quot;.On the ether hand, tho Police themselves appear to be ready to work the proposed Federation set up by the Bill quite loyally,   in Bristol, where some 90 per cent of the force belong to tho Union, they say that while they still remain members &quot;they recognise that the Union has dono Its work, and that the Federation will meet their needs.The union officials do not mean to go down without a struggle.   There is to be a Mass Meeting at the Central Hall, at 5.30 p.m. on the 31st July, and a demonstration on Tower Hill on the following day.   The demonstration is to make a surprise march to Downing Street, and another demonstration is planned for Sunday;   It now appears that the Union is&apos; enlisting ex-service men to pose as Polide, in order to swell the numbers.   Tho necessary measures as regards Downing Street will be taken.THSJ/
if&quot;THE COAL DEADLOCK(&amp;e Conference botween the Masters and men, held at Leeds yesterday, unfortunately broko down.  After the; meet Smith is reported to have said, &quot;There io nothing for it to hang on for four or fivo weeks and see what happens.&quot;The orisis must be regarded as only postponed until result of tho ballot is known. Nationalisation and the 61 increase are moro important to the miners than the questioi whioh the ballot was to be taken. Mr. Smillio wag probablj giving the opinion of hio followers when he said on July 2u&quot;It must be olearly understood that the mines are to bo nationalised.   If tho Government have decided that they ara not going to nationalise the mines, then the Miners&apos; Federation will havo something to say to it.The 6s. ,0d. a ton 1 stunt&apos; is a political dodge by a little band of peoplo whom we happen to know, who have made up their minds that they will oppose nationalisation even though lt be at the Cost of a general stoppage and the bringing out cf the military to shoot the minors down.&quot;Opinion, however, Is not unanimous among the miners, for, while Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire support nationalisation strongly, there Is opposition in the Hhynnej&apos; Valley.   In lAhoashire there is a distinct oioavage of opinion;&apos; the younger men are violent and extreme, but the older minors resent the continual stoppages and the taotios of the extremists.   The 6s. Od. tax upon the oonsumar oontinues to provoke general resentment.The relations between the strikers and the Naval ratings who are pumping the pits, appear, on the whole, to be friendly, but one or two districts are becoming more unertty and the miners are talking of compelling all the pit offioift&quot; to oease work and thereby force Naval ratings to take over ivery pit.  My correspondent in West Yorkshire reports that everywhere he found the men anxious to get back to work, toM that it was unlikely that a start would be made until after the holidays, whatever arrangements are made by the leaders-Managers/
lish)Managers generally estimate that at least fourteen days will be taken up by ropairs before any considerable quantity of ooal oan be despatched.TRIPLES INDUSTRIAL ALLIANCE and &quot;DIRECT ACTION&quot;,In so far as it is possible to foretell, it seoms likely that the ballot ordered by tho Executive of the Triple Allianoe on July 23rd will result in a majority for a strike, but this does not neoessarily mean that a strike will take place, for among the older Trade Unionists there is a strong feeling that Trade Unionism was oreated for the betterment of industrial conditions and not for political action.The Railwayman will not ballot because at their annual meeting on June 18th, 1919, they instructed their Executive to take any action necessary to secure the overthrow of conscription. ;The Transport Workers appear&apos; to, be by no means unanimous in favour of a strike,and Robert Williams has not as muoh influence as he thinks,&quot; They number, moreover, only 250,000.The miners, by reason of numbers alone (851,000) could outvote a unanimous decision of the other two organisations, and there seems little doubt that they will poll a huge majority in favour of a strike,   The question of nationalisation has been deliberately introduced by their leaders, who will further inflame opinion by alleging that the Government has aooepted Sir Arthur Duokham*s report.One reassuring factor in the situation is the return of Mr. J.H. Thomas, M.P., but it must be remembered1 that/- 5 -
that his Influence with the delegates is not so great as ij undoubtedly is with the rank and file.Of the six members of the Consultative Committee of the Triple Allianoe, three oan definitely be labelled &apos;extremistV:   Robert amillie, Robert Williams and C.T, CraiThe Parliamentary Labour Party has summoned a special meeting to-day to consider its attitude towards &quot;direot action&quot;.   Tho meeting is specially interesting, beoause abou half the Labour Members belong to the Triple Allianoe,THE POOD question a bitter feeling regarding the oost of living oontinuej My. correspondent reports that in Newcastle there is very decided disoontent with food prices and particularly with local retailers.  He states-that during the railway strike the increase in the price of home grown produce oaused great resentment.The cost of living is stated to be the main oause of unrest in the Birmingham district, where the people expeotei substantial reduction as a result of the oonolusion of peaoe,In Manchester and Liverpool profiteering is giving risJ to oonsidorable: irritation and^rotest meetings are to be hellWOOLWICHIt is reported that the various labour organisations in Woolwich are trying to effect amalgamation, in order to $ together in a Oo.se of emergenoy.   The workers in the area hai pledged themselves not to pay income tax until the exemption is raised,to  250, and demand the imposition of an excess profits tax of 100$ - with heavy sentences of penal servitudi for evasion.   The SailorsSoldiers1 and Airmen&apos;s Union continues to be very aotive in this area.LIVERPOOL/
There is great activity among tho agitators in Liverpool.  William Paul addressed a Mass Meeting of some 5,000 at the Liverpool Stadium on July 21st.   This man is an exoeption to the usual kind of agitator in that he is a linen draper in a largs way of business, with establishments at Manchester, Birmingham, Sheffield, and othor places. He has oontrol of considerable funds, and is a rather able writer.   He was a Conscientious Objootor, and before the Armiatioe his arrest was sought under the Military Servioe Aot, but he suooeeded in evading this.   Qn*the 23rd February last he made &amp; violent speeqh at Ashton, stating that secret instructions had been issued to the: Army to use ball cartridge in the event of strike troubles, and &apos; not to fire over the heads of the people, but into them. At Aberaman he pronounced himself an, ardent Bolshevik.SHEFFIELDAmongst the extremists who have recently visited Sheffield are Hodgson of Reading, Buchanan of Glasgow, iJbdeh Buxton and Wadia.   There is considerable unrost in the town and revolutionary speeohea are well received. Councillor Cfl. Wilson, J.JP., formerly Chairman, and now member, of the local Watch Committee, presided at an extremist meeting on July 20th.AHTI-PJ3VQLUTI0NARY MOVEMENT IN SOUTH wales in the Abertillery district there has been an outburst jpf resentment against tho extremists.  200(3 colliers of the Ctomtyllery Collieries have passed resolutions that all revolutionists shall bo expelled immediately from, any office and that tho affiliation ofthe/- 5 -
*the Lodge with the Abertillery Trades and Labour Couhoil shall be withdrawn.   It is reported that the movement is spreading rapidly, and it may have a profound effeot upon the attitude of labour in England.Two Socialist meetings at Heath on July 26th were broken up by discharged soldiers, who mounted the platforms and sang patriotic songs.   $om Mann, who spoke at the second meeting, was severely heckled.Mr. H. Woodland, who has been unanimously elected an honorary member of the ibertillery branch of the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilized Sailors and Soldien has announced his intention of starting an aotive campaign against revolutionaries.BBGBNE DISTuBBANCES AT SWINDONr.\..    .; On July 21st a.number of people demanded that a flagstaff, erected outside the Town Hail by the Mayor and Corporation at a oost of  200, should be taken down.   The Mayor, who was present, agreed, but the crowd became impatient at the non-arrival of workmen end burnt the flag-staff.   The following evening a gang of young hooligans broke about 30 windows.According to reliable information the disorder was in no way due to political or industrial unrest, but merely a result of the high prioe of the flagstaff; the local branch of the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers, numbering about 350, behaved splendidly and gave great assistance to the Polios1, by forming platoons and patrolling the streets..    SHE. FEELING AMONG DIS&amp;iARGBP SOLDIERS   &quot;The attitude of Bx-Servioe men still gives oause for anxiety.At/mm am j
KM    7    mt330At a reoent revolutionary meeting in Sheffield a member of the National Federation of Disoharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers stated that the local branch of his organisation numbered 7,000 and &quot;when the revolution is in progress these 7,000 men will know how to use the guns.&quot;It seems possible that there may be disturbances in Glasgow on the occasion of the i&amp;e&amp;ce Celebrations on August 4th.   Ex-Servioe men have arranged for a large counter-demonstration and mass meeting, and my correspondent reports that these will be warmly supported by labour organisations.A meeting of the Nottingham Branch of the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilized Sailors and Soldiers on July 27th was attended by about 1,000 men. The local leaders at present seem to avoid politics and there is, as yet, no evidence of revolutionary wire-pulling in this branoh.In Manchester and Liverpool the feeling amongst disoharged men is particularly aggressive.   On 25th July a meeting of ex-3ervide men demanded an unemployment grant of  2&apos;find threatened, if the demand were not granted, to pioket local Government offices and&apos; eixamine. the right of the workers to employment.liy correspondent reports that, although the disoharged men in the Leeds district are very unsettled, there is small probability of concerted action at pre  sent j owing to the conflicting olaims of the various organisations, ;rAt Sheffield on July 27th, 20,000 disoharged soldiers demonstrated against  naeloouate pensions and. allowances Ex-soldiers are being used as speakers at extremistmeetings/
meetings and their appearance on the platforms of counter-revolutionary sooieties would probably have a good effect.It is beginning to appear doubtful whether the suggested amalgamation of all the fix-Service Organisations will not lead to trouble in the future.   The tendenoy is for men of extreme views to force themselves into the control of such bodies, and a single organisation in bad hands would be a serious complication.THE EX-OFFICERS NATIONAL MI ONThe disoontent amongst Hx-Offioers has orystallized into a. definite movement.   The main object of the Ex-Officers National Union is to obtain the redemption of the Government pledge that no man who gave his servioes to the country shall . suffer want on return to civil life.At a mass meeting on July 24th, resolutions were passed demanding the substitution of men for women in Government departments and in the auxiliary services, and half pay for Ex-Officers. .iiany dlsoharged Officers, who are quite unable to find suitable employment, are in a restless and disloyal frame of mind.   Phe problem of what can be done for them is very diffioult for there are men who would be unable to make a living in the Colonies, while in England the only employment they would oonsent to take is olosed to them.At present the most aotive members of the Union appear to be Lt, E.H, Derout, Captain R. Savage, Major G.N. rlom and the Hon. Secretary, Mr. E. Mallett Mote.THE WQRKBR31 COMMITTEES&apos; &amp; SHOP STEWARDS * movements the inoreased aotivity which was expeoted on the -release/
M   Qrelease of Ramsay is already in evidence. The first move has been the issue in thousands of a ciroular letter opposing the-principle of Joint&apos; industrial Councils. The Amalgamated Society of Engineers&apos; brarbhes itid&apos;members have received special attention and;are apparently reaponding. V/oolwidft has refused the application of the scheme to the - &apos;  iirsenal by on overwhelming&apos;mjority.It le reported thiit a conference will be held to effeot co-ordinated action between branches in London.Mr. RAMSAY MACDONALDJ Mr. Ramsay Maodonald writes to John de Kay that he isstarting for Lucerne on the 24th July.  &apos;IRELANDThe.Victory iSaroh in Dublin, which took, ne^irly an hour and a half to pass the Viceroy, wag a great suooeas and was not marked by any untoward incident.   Some lively soenes, however, took plaoe in the evening when two soldiers got into trouble with the crowd in Saokville Street.   They were followed to one of the Quays and attempts were made to throw one of them into the Liffey.   Sergeant Roche endeavoured to quiet the orowd, but he was shot in the back and taken to Hospital.The Sinn Fein movement still shews signs of being on the down grade and in County Longford, where the Club organisation is good, scarcely any of the Clubs have paid the fees due on January 1st last,   a ciroular from Sinn Fein Headquarters also shews their urgent need of funds.De Valera*s tour oommands little attention and the Sinn Fein leaders, who are left to Carry on in his absence, are by no means satisfied with his results.The/
. The proclamation prohibiting Sinn Fein organizations , in Tipperojpy has been taken very quietly and,there are no -incidents to report.. The agricultural strikes in Meath and Kildaro oontimn but intimidation is not so rife as it was, tfhere is, howeve a feeling of uneasiness as harvest time approaches.0&apos;Meagher and O^Hagaa. the two Belfast extremists with Bolshevik.ideas who were sentenced to six months&apos; imprisonme have been released,after a hunger strike,to secure treatment as political offenders.On the whole the Peaoe Celebrations passed off without any serious trouble, though a few isolated oases of violence took place in the more disaffeoted.areas.It is reported that John Maclean, with MoManus and Kirkwood, have been in Ireland during the Glasgow Pair holidays, but are returning this week;- 10 - I
