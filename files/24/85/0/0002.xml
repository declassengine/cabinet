SECEET.WAR CABINET.PROPOSED  PROVISION   OF  ARMOURED  CARS.Memoeandum by the Secretary of State for War.The need for armoured cars at the present time is urgent. The strength of the British Forces all over the world is being rapidly reduced; the duties which the remaining units will be called upon to perform will be largely of a police nature, over wide and unsettled areas. In these conditions, mobile armoured cars fitted with machine guns will be of the highest military value. At present, there are in possession of the British Army, 22 in Egypt, 55 in Mesopotamia, 42 in Ireland, and 50 in Great Britain  169 in all.This is not sufficient to meet the demands which may at any time be made upon us, and in view of the time necessary for manufacture, it is considered essential to have a certain number in hand. I therefore desire to proceed at once with the armouring of 100 chassis already in stock, pending the consideration of a complete programme. It has not been possible to obtain firm prices for the work involved, but it is estimated at 50,000?. Treasury authority has been asked for that sum, but has up to the present been withheld.Several months have been lost, and in view of the fact that a few armoured cars do the work of a very considerable number of infantrymen, costing far more, it is hoped that a Cabinet decision may now be given.In consequence of the delays in demobilization, the increases in the pay of the Army and delayed recoveries from Germany, it cannot be said at present that this sum is available on the original Estimates of the year; but a Supplementary Estimate is, in any event, unavoidable.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.25th July, 1919.(B19/338)  70  7/19  H&amp;S  ?346woThis document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.
