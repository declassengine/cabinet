10 Downing Street., 28/7/19.iZ) ;The Attorney General agrees- that it is highly unfortunate that amendments which were definitely accepted on behalf of the Government in the House of Colons ars to he oxpunged in the House of lords at the instance of the Government, and if the pledge referred to is still to &quot;be regarded as binding it would have been better if tho true position had been disclosed to tho House of C oik one before the-.-ar.cndse.nts were accented *      In any; event/ the nutter appears to be one for consideration and decision &quot;by the Cabinet. The Committee stage is to betaken in the House of lords io-mcrrow (Tuesday) how deferred until V/oAnesday.and it is i;iportant that the matter should be dealt with by the Cabinet without delay.The principal in question was raised in another form in the negotiations preliminary. to the -appointment of the Coal Industry commission, and the following provision appears in Section 4 of the lot, namelyA person examined (Js &amp; witness or summoned to produce, documents tot. the Commissioners shall not be excused from producing any. document or giving any information on the ground.that such document or information is secrot; or confidential, or is entitled or required to be withheld under, section two .cf the Official Secrets Act-. 1911, or- under.the Coal Minos Control Agreement (Confirmation) Act, 1910, oi the agreement thereto, scheduled, and section four of the last mentioned Aet shall not apply to the Qommissioners or uny person concerned in the- enquiry.
