Trawlers.At Libau the situation is quiet,   With regard to the evacuation of Lettland, General Gough met Von der Goltz on 2^th July when the latter stated that in&quot;&apos;view of present railway facilities 74 days would be required for the evacuation of German troops from Latvia.   The impression gained is that Germans are delaying withdrawalon the chance of some pretext for future intervention arising.   Their continued presence will delay the re-organisation of the country. &apos; All information tends to bear out reports that Germans are concentrating at Mitau.Russian-arrangements at Riga are proceeding satis-factorily.   1.500 Russian troops have been embarked &quot;for Narva, and the situation is well in hand.   Ulmanis11 Government is functioning.It is reported that the Germans are working hard to persuade Russian prisoners to join Prince Li even&apos;s Army, of which Von der Goltz is to be the Chief of Staff.According to reports from Kovno, Kovno and the greater part of Lithuania is clear of Germans, except railways between Tilsit, Shavli and Mitau; and Memel, Prekulu and Mitau.   The , former, line is crowded with Germans and Russians, moving to Mitau.   The advance of Poles against Kovno has ceased.The Russian North West Army has been reinforced and is now asting in concert vrith the Ssthonian Army and General Yudenitch is transferring his headquarters to Narva.   British Mission is also established there.&quot; If forced to retire General Yudenitch intends to avoid Isthonia and to transfer his head-quarters to Pskov.NQilMRN mSUuARCIMffiL.   G.O.C. wired on July 21st, that whole of the Onega front had been handed over to Bolsheviks by our Russian troops who had mutinied.   The town will be occupied by British troops.. There are signs of. mutiny along the railway front, but attempts have been frustrated by Poles and British.&quot; The cause isevidently ......
t- 2 -evidently the sudden and strong enemy propaganda and the statement of evacuation of the country from hngland, which has led to wildest rumours in Archangel district. Russian poops are being disarmed in parties as British arrive.   The state of the Russian troops is such that G.0,Co considers that it is certain that his efforts to consolidate Russian national Army cuaM&amp;a failure definitely.    As early an evacuation as possible is now essential unless&apos; British force is increased.  In any case withdrawal from Dwina and Vaga must commence as tactical situation demands this and no offensive is possible.  This may entail loss of heavier draught ships of flotilla, which can not come down river cring to small depth of water.   The two things.most feared are(1) The activity on right flank by Bolsheviks augmented by mutineers.(2) A possible mutiny at Seletski or Pinega. Time will show if this is likely.Evacuation before river rises will mean abandonment of 5 monitors and 1 gunboat besides barges which will be needed for blocking purposes.   The situation is now more in hand; it is proposed to send out the Plensburg Battalion of marines and also more mines to mine the river to prevent operations by the Bolshevik River Flotilla.Mr. Hoare at Archangel wiring to-Foreign Office states that in considering evacuation bur obligations to Russians in the district must not be overlooked, leaving them behind would mean leaving them in the hands of unprincipled murderers.Seaplane c. No. 9251 crashed while rising on barge seriously injuring soldiers on board; Pilot badly shaken, Observer missing, believed drowned.MURMANSK.   The failure of enemy attack on Tivdiya was a great blow to him.  From authentic information he lost 40 killed and 57 wounded.The Italian troops have had to be withdrawn from front line owinp to decided Bolshevik tendencies which are now being shown&quot;.G.0.C, Kern, in view of situation at Archangel, presses for immediate repatriation of Finnish Legion as he fears that the news of tno Onega mutiny is likely to have exceedingly bad result; also that it may spread &apos;to the Russian troops iii training who have never proved to be over-reliable. He urges action from the Finnish and Esthonian side to distract Bolshevik attention from the Northern front and requests that a cruiser may be sent to Kern.On July 25th seaplanes bombed railway bridge at Ust Suna - 20 miles N. of Petrozavodsk in order to hinder arrival of enemy reinforcements.   The bridge was hit but damage slight.    It was therefore decided to organise raid to destroy rail and road bridges at Ust Suna.   This&quot;raid was successfully accomplished and both bridges were burnt to water&apos;s edge.    Both are large bridges andwill take considerable time to repair.  Meanwhile enemy troops North of Ust Suna are practically cut off from reinforcements except by Lake craft.The Yacht &quot;Alvina&quot; was turned over to the Russian Authorities at Murmansk on July 15th.The situation at Fiurae appears to be easier, no further outbreaks having arisen.General Watts, who has been selected as the British representative   on the International Commission of Enouiry into the Fiume riots, has been appointed President of the Commission.There
There is no change in the Political situation in the Adriatic,  As far as can he judged, tho Yugo*-Slavs would welcome any decision removing Piume from Italian influence, and-the recently proposed internationalisation of the Port gave great satisfaction,A solution of the Flume problem seems to he to con-struct another Port for the Yugo-Siavs, and Klek seems exceptionally well suited for the purpose.   It is only.8 miles from the existing railway system, is perfectly protected, with deep water, and its development has been contemplated by the AustriansoThe Yugo-Slav State would most probably make little use of Piume even if it were assigned to them, as it is cora-manded from Italian heights,^ and it would chiefly serve Hungary*N.A., Rome, reports very favourably on Klek as a Yugo-Slav harbour.Mine sweeping continues of Imbros. Lline clearance Officer expects to&apos;be able to leave Aegean for Black Sea in six to eight weeks7 time.The following bases on the Egypt and Red Sea Station have been closed     Ismailia, Haifa, Alexandria, Beirut, Tripoli, Famagusta,, Suez^A question having been raised as to the ownership of Imbros and Leranos, the Foreign Office propose to lay down that the former is certainly Turkish and the latter may be regarded as Turkish pending the continuance of a state of war with TurkeycVice Admiral Sir J.H., de Robeck is expected to arrive at Naples on August 24th.

The admiralty have replied that in view of the fact that it has-been reported&apos; that the Bolsheviks&apos; have no submarines capable of putting to sea they do not now consider it necessary.to mine or net this channel, but they will remain prepared to do so should the situation arise; in the meantime they have expressed their intention that should any Bolshevik man-of-war put to sea she will be treated as.an enemy and brought to action.The French JS.N..0., Varna,&apos; is prepared to take over Bulgarian T.Bo No. 1 from us, but has not yet received ..-sanction from his Government *jQAiMAli ....
Definite orders have been given that the Fleet is to be handed over to  Denekin before the 15th August, as the mili- &quot; tary withdrawal from Baku commences on that date.   The Air Ministry have also informed G.O.C, H.A.F., and all Air personnel is.;to &quot;be withdrawn before 15th August.    R.A.. Black Sea, wires that utmost will be done to adhere., to date but owing to Denikin having, been informed that Caspian Heet would be turned over to Italians, he had suspended his preparations.The actual situation appears to be that while the volunteers are advancing on Astrakhan from the Northward and Eastward the Bolsheviks&quot;themselves are advancing from Astrakhan to the South-westward, and are apparently threatening the Petrovrk-Novorossisk railway; the situation likely to he created is serious.   ,fe have to hand over our fleet and aircraft to Denekin before the 15th Au^st.   Our stores and reserve ammunition are at present at Baku.    By an agreement entered into between Denekin and the &apos;^7ar Office the Volunteer Army is not allowed into Baku, consequently the transfer will have to be made at Petrovsk. and should this place fall or the railway liije be cut this will be impossible.   It is not believed the transfer will be interfered with by the enemy fleet as at least half the fleet is believed to be above Tsaritsin, and is therefore cut off by the Volunteer Army.The Admiralty has recommended the removal of all restrictions on trade with the Red Sea Ports. The Foreign Office concurs, subject to General Allenbyfs approval.The question of French and Italian co-operation for , the prevention of Arms Traffic is under consideration.   It having been proposed that a coast reconnaissance service should be undertaken by light draught craft, auch as twin screw mine-sweepers, and that they should be manned and entirely maintained by the Egyptian and Soudan Governments.   The Admiralty has stated that no such ships are available.It has been pointed out to the 7ar Office and Foreign Office that it is urgently necessary to withdraw H.N.S. &quot;Topaae&quot; from the Red Sea.

She will require at least six months to repair.   Under the circumstances sho will pay off on August 7th, and her crew return to England by transport.  Proposals are under consideration for her sale for breaking up, as it is not considered she is worth the expenditure of money required to make her fit for sea.All naval personnel is being withdrawn from Siberia and ordered to embart- on H.I&apos;.3. &quot;Carlisle&quot; at Vladivostock.&apos;Permission has been given to leave a liaison Officer with koltchak, should an Officer volunteer,It is reported that a fleet of Russian cargo ships would commence service between San Francisco and Vladivostock on July 1st.NORTH ------
