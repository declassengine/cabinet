^frnerttf of1002SECRET.&apos;&quot;&quot; OPERATIONS.From:-   General Barter, Russia.22/9/17.To:-       C.I.G.S., War Office. 1265.This morning all allied representatives paid collectively their respects to Kerenski as Supreme Commander and expressed the hopes of their respective chiefs for a speedy restoration of order in the Army.    I referred, in view of forthcoming operations in Mesopotamia, to great and immediate importance of definite information regarding morale of Russian troops in the Caucasus. Kerenski replied that ail arrangements previously made still held good.    I endeavoured to elicit from him what were the measures Government had in view.   He evaded direct answer with a lawyer&apos;s subtlety, but assured us he would do everything possible to restore proper discipline to officers.    I asked if measures contemplated were such as would secure confidence of their leading generals.   He replied that they were, but I do not believe it.    In the name of all my colleagues I expressed hope that no military power would be entrusted at G.H.Q,. to representatives of organizations such as the Soviet. He replied that there was no intention of doing so.    I again impressed on him that we were engaged in a great and continuous battle on our front which we hoped would assist Russians in setting their house in order without delay.     The interview elicited little from Kerenski, but it gave to representatives opportunity of speaking their minds firmly.   What I said to Kerensky greatly pleased Alexeieff. . I told Alexeieff that we all regretted his departure immensely, and hoped earnestly for his return.   He looks worn and aged.   He said that news from Jacobstadt this morning was unfavourable as in one place Russians had been forced back 3 miles.   Some of the troops had fought very well and not yielded an inch.   He thought that Army would have to take up positions on right bank of river*   Every effort would be made to save Dvinsk.
