SECRET. Intelligence Bureau,- &apos;   ;    ^ &apos; Department of Information.&apos;&apos;     0*\ f-S) DBW/016.. - &apos; WEEKLY REPORT ON BULGARIA. XVI. - (27 September, 1917).The General Situation.The Bulgarian reply to tb3 Papal Note is unlikely to contain anything unexpected.   The Bulgarian press has from the first given the Peace Note a favourable reception, and the Bulgarian Government in its reply will certainly welcome the ?ope&apos;s overtures. It is only to be expected that they will enlarge on Bulgaria&apos;s racial justification to the territories she has won in this war. It is recognised by all parties in Bulgaria that this is the best means of Inducing neutral and even enemy opinion to view their demands with favour.    It is also hoped in Bulgaria that the United States will be favourable to Bulgarian claims.   The Mir, \-hich, owing to the connection of many members of the Nationalist Party with Robert College, Constantinople, has always been in touch with American opinion, is again advocating an understanding-*with the United States in the hope that the American Government will recognise Bulgarian national demands.     Possibly this hope is strengthened by the fact that the United States have never broken off diplomatic relations with Bulgaria,     In a recent leading article in the Mir such language occurs as; &quot;Devastated. Macedonia cries for justice to the whole world&quot;        &quot;Can America, remain a silent onlookeji when other countries are attempting to conquer Macedonia?&quot;       In the article no reference is naturally made to the state of the Macedonians under the present Bulgarian rule; to the levies, massacres and confiscations which have been carried on in occupied Old Serbia, the Morava Valley, and Dobrogea, or to
the wholesale deportations of Greeks from Eastern Macedonia, on which much light has been thrown by the publication of the GreekWhite Book last month.It must be remembered that the Mir is now in political relations with the Bulgarian Government.     Mr Peyev, the editor^ is on friendly terms with Radoslavov.    In return, Professor Milev, editor of the official Echo de Bulgarle, has now gone to Switzerland on behalf of the &quot;Alliance of Bulgarian Savants, Writers and Artists&quot;.     In Report No. V   attention was drawn to the foundation of this &quot;Alliance&quot; and to its probable character. The Government press at the time attacked it furiously, but this attack was obviously merely a blind.   As was written in that Report, &quot;Geshov is earning his liberty by this useful propaganda, on which Radoslavov and Berlin pretend to frown but which they are certainly supporting&quot;.     Professor Milev&apos;s mission to   ; Switzerland on behalf of the &quot;Alliance&apos;1 is an interesting confirmation of this conjecture.4Intrigues in Switzerland.Bulgarian agents are particularly active in Switzerland at present.   People who purport to represent various parties and policies are roaming the country doing propaganda work for the Bulgarian Government and endeavouring to exchange ideas with Entente representatives.   Such views as have been extracted from them all point to the same fact:   that acutely as they differ among themselves on matters of Internal policy and, still more, of personal interest, they are united in demanding the satisfaction In full of Bulgaria&apos;s chauvinistic aims.     In these Reports it has repeatedly been pointed out that the Bulgarian Socialists (with the exception of the &quot;Narrow&quot; Socialist wing vfoich is entirely &quot;Zlmmerwaldian&quot; Internationalist in character)
are no whit behind the other parties in their chauvinism. Interviews which have recently taken place between Mr Sakyzov (leader of the &quot;Broad&quot; Socialists) and some of our confidential agents show that he has little other end in view than the recognition of these claims by the Entente Powers.Bulgaria and her Allies.The German Government is at present playing a curious game.It is not neglecting to strengthen its hold on Bulgaria.Hot only are German commerce and finance devoting their energiesto consolidating their position in Bulgaria, but the movement forsocial and cultural inter-connection goes on continuously.12 Bulgarian journalists have lately been touring in Germany.Towards the end of September the three greatest contemporaryGerman dramatists, Hauptmann, Sudermann, and Ludv/ig Fulda, areto visit Bulgaria;   and yet at the same time the German Governmentis permitting the free expression of Hermann Tf*endelfs views inVorwarts and other Socialist organs.Attention has already been drav,n to the controversy, in haswhich Herr Wendel/played the leading part, as to the racial character of Macedonia.   The controversy continues and there are heated arguments between Herr Wendel, who brings forward conclusive evidence that the Macedonians are not racially &quot;Bulgarians,f, and Mr Rizov and other press champions of Bulgarian claims.is at present only a conjecture, but it seems a possible one, that Germany, in the event of her being able to secure what she now hopes, the elimination of Russia from the war either by a separate peace or by the permanent annexation of Russian territories (thereby securing her control of the Balkans beyond the possibility of disturbance), would settle the Balkan question
by maintaining the old feuds between Serbs and Bulgars and Rumans and Bulgars.   This might be done by giving back Macedonia to an enfeebled Serbia who would be quite unable tc withstand the pressure of the Central Powers and might, In default of anything better, he forced to accept with gratitude the unexpected return of this province.   Bulgaria would be kept at the side of the Central Empires by the acquisition of territory at the expense of Serbia (e.g. Timok and Kraina departments), Rumania and Greece, as well as by economic and political necessities, but she would not be so unduly strengthened as to present any obstacle to German penetration.     At the same time, the continuance of Baikal feuds, which has in recent times been the first axiom of German policy, would leave the Germanic Powers in the pleasing position of arbiters of the fate of the Balkan nations.   This is, of course, merely a conjecture as to future policy, but it is only on some such assumption that the tolerance on the part of the German Government of the opposition to Bulgarian claims expressed by the German Socialists seems explicable.   Prom time to time when Bulgarians become too restive on the subject of Germany&apos;s attitude towards Bulgarian claims, German official representatives in Sofia and elsewhere pour oil on the troubled waters by assuring them that Germany intends to support these claims7]The Economic Situation.Though not exhausted, Bulgaria is certainly suffering severe economic hardships.   The bread ration, though more liberal than in other enemy countries, is a considerable restriction of the quantity usually consumed in this&apos; country, In which bread is the chief article of diet.   It was necessary to conciliate the agricultural population by assuring them that they would be permitted to keep for themselves sufficient quantities of grain to supply them for
!5. Ia year to come, &quot;but none the less the food restrictions are not at all popular amongst them.      Meat is scarce and expensive, and the supply is only kept up at all by means of requisitions on a large scale from the occupied Serbian provinces.     Vegetables have gone up in some cases ten times in price.     There is a scarcity of cloth, and clothes may only be bought by authorisation of local committees. Leather is very scarce indeed,and a movement has been started to induce the schoolboys to go barefooted.     There is a great scarcity of paper, and various newspapers are from time to time compelled to suspend their issue for a day or two.   Naturally, these unpleasant conditions do not add to the popularity of the war, which the Bulgarian peasant had been informed would only last some months and would be concluded as soon as Bulgaria had obtainediher territorial demands.     At the same time, though not enthusiastic, the Bulgarian people are obviously acquiescent in the continuance of hostilities, for they are confident that the Entente Powers do not intend any intensification of the Salonlki expedition, the only expedition which threatens them personally.     They hope at best-that the victory of the Central  Powers will make them predominant in the Balkans and indispensable to the Central Empires. They hope at worst that, even if the Central Powers are defeated, they may be able to secure the pardon and favour of. the Western Powers and the United States of America by pleading that they were misled by a foreign Tsar and that their sole aim in intervention W8S to secure national Bulgarian territories.    In order to be able to point to the Bulgarian character of tho occupied lands they are, as has been pointed out, hastening the Bulgariaation of the Morava Valley, Dobrogea, and Greek Macedonia.27.9.17.
