rpHIS -nOCUMSHT IS THE - PROPERTY 0? HIS BR1TAMI0 MAJS3TY1 S GOVSRHMSIiT.s^5 0 BET.WAR CABINET,SITUATION III AMIUKICA.Possibility of accelerating date on which United Stages troops are to be placed in the line.2. Suggested official visit of Colonel House or Mr^Balcer (War Minister) to London and Paris.Copy of telegram (Ho-IS) daied 21st September, 1917, from Sir W. Wiseman, Hew York to Sir B.; Drummbnd.a. Situation here is better than when I left.   McA&amp;oo Is more inclined to be helpful because he now realises very seriousresponsibility Y*?hich he would assume if Allied finance /collapsed through any potty action of his.     Of course he has still his political difficulties and there are serious financial problems un-eolve&amp;v but Lord Heading is approaching them in the right spirit and is very acceptable person to all the Administration.   , Houso, as-usual, is very helpful and I believe wg are now tackling situation properly.b. Vchile I cannot say that there is any popular enthusiasm for war thore is very stolid determination to carry on with all resources of country until German military power is.crushed. Position of President remains very strong.     Feeling towards British is improving but Administration is.becoming impatient with French.c. President learnt frdni confidential souroe that   , French morale is very bad and that.they m&amp;y not hold together through the winter.     He is alarmed about this and he would do enything in reason to safeguard situation.    For example,, he might put United -States troops into th$ line earlier than at present intended.d. For your private information only, I believe that H would be possible to persuade President to send House or Baker, Wfcr Minister, on an official visit to London and Paris to confer.Do you think that this would be desirable?e. Reference to Cecils aable to House regarding; Blockade co-operation:   in principle suggestions ere acceptable and I think that the matter can be arranged if you would lot me  now precisely what you want.
