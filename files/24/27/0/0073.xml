Duke to Sir Uaurieo Hankey,   1st October 1917*.your message as to situation in Dublin: faots and present position e as follows:-;Jhen I arrived on Saturday morning condition of affairs gave cause or anxiety.   The death of Thomas Ashe, the two days enquiry before the jroner, the admittance of the public in very great numbers to a lying-in-tate at the hospital^ afterwards at the Roman Catholic Iro-Cathedral, id ultimately at the City Hall, had created very marked excitement which ia being steadily aggravated (by the) opportunity of newspaper reports, consulted with the 1&apos;risons Board, the Police, General Sir Bryan iiahon id with special medical advisers who afterwards examined all the men-it) became apparent to me that continuance of hunger strike involved isk of life which Government ought not to take.   It was certain also that aless some ameliorative action could be taken during day strike would jntinue and risks increase.   Two man who were in some danger v/ere removed o Hospital in course of Saturday.   On learning available facts I examined ie Churchill rules of 1910 which were framed in England for the care of. :isonera whose offences do not involve the gross elements of criminality, id which had been in use in Ireland to some extent for persona not lou-;nced to hard labour, and I caused to be convened a meeting of the Privy iiincil Ireland whioh could authorise the extension of like rules with srtain modifications to * the prisoners undergoing sentence under Defence &apos; the Realm Acts and Regulations.At this meeting an Order in Council was made to this effect a Rules following the Churchill Rules have been drafted and are ing applied.      The Lord Llayor of Dublin,   who has acted with odwili in a difficult situation informed the prisoners on Saturday ght with my sanction that rules were being made to admit of their ing separately classified in prison with ameliorations of theordinary
noordinary prison treatment.The hunger-strike was thereupon discontinued and from that time the men have taken their food and caused no further disorder.     The Order ,of the Privy Council and the changed conditions were-announced- in the Lublin Sunday newspapers yesterc.ay morning.     The -public demonstration at the funeral of Ashe yesterday :^ve proof .by its magnitude of a general feeling of sympathy among the.Lublia populace.     There was no offence against ordinary police regulations but a firing party, of the Irish Volunteers fired a salute over the grave, but the General Officer Commanding thought, and I agreed, that to prevent this would have been un?;ise and provocative.    After the funeral the order of the City was reported by the police to be complete and this continues.Pursuant to an intention provisionally formed before I returned and whioh 1 had the idvantage of discussing, when I considered the situation, with the prime Minister on Friday evening before leaving London I ascertained that it would be practicable to re-opon Lun&amp;alk prison for the reception of prisoners committed under thJ Lefence of the Realm Regulations, They can then be dealt with as a class without disturbing the discipline of another prison..     I have accordingly sanctioned the ife-oponing of Lundalk with a view to the removal there of some or all of the present prisoners and tho detention there of any men who may bo imprisoned under Defence Regulations. The health of all the.prisoners is steadily improving.h. - V LUKE.
