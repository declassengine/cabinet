SEC -R--E -T. G.T.-2133jvA H,    C -A 3 J,.J. J5J?*DECISION OF JIIOH COUST AS TO BMJtS, PEijS (Memorandum &quot;by Lord Rhondda/.I desire to draw the attention of the War Cabinet to the **rioa* position resulting from a recent decision of the High Court as to the effect Of the Orders under which Boans have been requisitioned and dealt with by the Wheat Commission.    Briefly, the alternatives before me are.-(1)   To act upon the High Court*s decision, whieh means that&apos;the Wheat Commission will have to pay over to each of the persons who speoulatod in the Beans, tho profit of suoh speculation.(2)   To introduce a bill in.Parliament Validating the Orders as mado.In view of the nature of tho speculation and &quot;profiteoring&quot; that took place in relation to these Boans (an example of which is given in the attached memorandum) I desire to press for tho adoption of the second course.It is just possible that since the tr adors are acting together in this matter, the more threat of a bill would induce them by agreement to continue to accept and act on the Orders aS made, in spite of the decision, as they had accepted them before, the decision,.but before bargaining with them, I ask to be armed with the assent of the Government to&quot;the introduction of a bill if necessary.(Signed)   BHOJjDDAc.Ministry of Food.2 , th&quot;September , 1917,&apos;
i Q AMEMORANDUM PIT BEANS.PSAS &amp; PULSE REQUISITION ORDERS^1. A serious question has arisen under two requisitioning orders made by Lord Devanport as Food Controller relating to Imported Beans, Peas and Pulse,.2. On the 1st May,  1917, Lord Devonport made an Order taking over from the original consignees all Burmah Peas and Beans, which should thereafter come to the United Kingdom,  the price to the original consignees being agreed at  37 per ton.  and all contracts for sale made by them or persons claiming under them being cancelled.3. On the 17th May,  1917,  a similar Order affecting all Other Imported Beans and Peas and Pulse was made,  the only difference being that the price was left for future settlement. Under the first Order about 58,000 tons and under the second Order about 120,000 tons are being taken over.4,. Both Requisitioning Orders are in course of being acted upon through the agency cf the wheat Commission and about sixty per cent of the goods have been dealt with.   The persons interested accepted and acted on the Orders for some three months.   The Orders proved workable in practice, and did not affect injustice. As articles arrivedpossession was taken of them, the original consignees were paid and the goods were placed cn the market at a price which enabled them to be sold retail in the shops at prices fixed by Lord Devonpert.   In no single instance have the original consignees who were responsible for ,the goods coming to this country complained of the treatment accorded them.5. The persons claiming under the original consignees have, however,  recently combined and at their instance legal pro-ceedings were taken against the Attorney General as nominal defendant.    The case came on for hearing on July 30thr and it was held by Mr. Justice Rowlatt and it was decided that the Pood Controllers powers did not enable him to take over from the Original consignees articles which they had agreed to sell and.the property in which had passed to the purchasers.   The Attorney General is of the opinion that.the decision is un-doubtedly correct.   In the circumstances it does not appear possible to appeal.against the decision.6. This decision nullifies the whole object of the Order and in effect secures to persons who had dealt in the articles their profits.   The articles had been dealt in extensively and prices had risen to an extraordinary figure.   A large part of the dealings was pnrg profiteering.   Persons wfty had previously no connection with/Trade were engaged in buying and selling Beans and Peas and it was estimated that in the case of Burmah Beans they had been resold from seven to ten times over.   The market price for Burmah Beans on the day when the Order was made was about  78 per ton; the pre-war price was about  22&apos;per ton.
7,     An. example may be given of. p?p transaction in Dutter^Beans and of the working of the-Order.   Twenty five tons of Butter&quot;Beans were bought on the 17th November 1916 at.  36. per ton.   They were sold on the 13th December 1916 at  44 a ton and resold on the 30th March. 191&apos;? at  89, per tonir The Beans arrived about the end of May 1917/. . The first sellerrs profit amounts to  200 or 22 per cent on the original price.   The second seller&apos;s. to  1,125. or 125$ on the original price over and above the first seller&apos;s profit.As, under the Order, the Beans -ere to be taken over from the original consignees at  37,per ton and the subsequent sales were to be cancelleds the original consignees were paid at the rate of  37 per ton and nothing was paid to the various purchasers, claiming under them.Under the decision, the actual owner, i.e. the last purchaser, will have to be. paid, and as it would be difficult to get off with the payment of any sum less than the price paid for the articles, it will be necessary, if the decision is to stand, for the. State to pay. the first seller  200 and the &quot;second seller  1,125.   This Instance could be multiplied, indefinitely .8.     It is believed that the making of these Orders had a very wide effect in stopping gambling in foodstuffs and this indirect consequence is of the greatest importance .9.     It. is not possible.to state exactly how great is the sum of money Involved, but it may be estimated at  4,500,000.     That is to say this is the additional amount that would have to be paid out by the Wheat Commission to the dealers if the decision stands .10.     It is desired in the circumstances to introduce a short Bill to legalise both Orders, and at once to make a public announcement that such a Bill will be.introduced by the Government at the beginning of the next, session.(Initialled)    R.26/9/17
