Cole JonesSECRET.MINISTRY  OF  FOOD.Report for Week ending Wednesday, September 26, 1917.PART I. ACTION  TAKEN.Control of Supplies and Prices.Allied Purchases in America,-On September 20, Lord Rhondda received the representatives in London of the American, Canadian, and Australian newspapers, and made a statement on the allocation of the world&apos;s food supplies. He instanced the establishment of the Meats and Fats Executive and the Sugar Committee as typical of the way in which the Allied Governments were endeavouring to solve the Allied food problem with the least possible dislocation of existing trade arrangements, and of their determination that armies and civilians alike should be &quot;provided, at a fair price, with food enough to ensure victory.On September 22, Lord Northcliffe cabled that the wide publication in New York of Lord Rhonclda&apos;s statement had done good, and that he was grateful for the way in which his mission had been strengthened. He added that Mr. Hoover spoke enthusiastically of the methods adopted for co-operation.Bacon, Hams, and Lard. Lord Rhondda received a deputation of West of England and Eastern Counties pig salesmen and bacon curers at Grosvenor House on September 20 when the question of maximum prices and distribution was discussed. Other conferences with the trade are being held for the same purpose. .Owing to world shortage and increased Army demands there is, at present, a scarcity of these commodities. Anxiety is, moreover, caused by the fact that the Treasury have not yet been able to place further funds in the United States to the credit of this Ministry, while the credit of $6,000,000 already sanctioned is nearly exhausted.    ...   . &apos;.   ;   ?-&apos;-;*&quot;!Butter and Cheese.-Lord Rhondda has appointed the following Advisory Committee to consider the control, purchase and distribution of butter : Mr. E.

, ....       PART II-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD. POSITION. -Some features in the accompanying paragraphs call for particular notice :  (1) The imports of both tea and bacon show considerable improvement, that of tea being larger than any since the beginning of June and for the first time, since that date, exceeding the estimated consumption and so . tending to replenish the stock, which had been falling with great rapidity.(2) The latest figures with regard to ;home-fed meat point in the direction of an increase of sales, though as yet it is too early to speak definitely as to the movement.(3) The need of a new effort to secure economy in consumption is indicated by the tables dealing with the use of flour and the entries of fat stock and meat into the respective markets. &apos; : v: ;&apos;;. ; . Imports.The aggregate of the imports of principal foods (including rice) Table A. was 187,500 tons in the week ended September 22nd ; this amount is very nearly the same as in each of the two preceding weeks, but 12 per cent, below the average for the four weeks ending September 1st and 42 per cent, below that of the four weeks ended August 4th. . ..  -      &quot;   ,&apos;Only 54,800 tons of wheat and flour was received, as. compared with 98,000 tons the week before * Other cereals increased 12&apos;per cent, to 51,000 tonsi Of rice, 14*000 tons was imported. .  t,   :   . : - -. The following table exhibits importation of meat and bacon, &amp;c, in recent weeks:  .v! .     .I    :     -    H      . &quot;Bacon and Hams..

The imports of tea have risen greatly, being 3,309 tons, the largest amount of recent months, -Consumption.Meat,-The supply of homered meat at the Central Market, London, and at Manchester, Glasgow and Liverpool Markets (Table B.), was in the week ended September 15th 14 per cent, above the previous week and 17 per cent, above the corresponding week last year, increases being recorded in each market, A further considerable increase (500 tons) took place in London in the week ended September 22nd.Foreign supplies continued to fall in each market to September 15th, but there was a recovery to the July level in London in the subsequent week.The supply of fat cattle at 51 markets in Great Britain &quot;(Table C.) shows a marked increase in the week ended September 19th; it was 23 per cent, above the previous week and also 23 per cent, above the corresponding week last year. There was also an increase of fat sheep, the number being 19 per cent, above the previous week. The supply of pigs was 6 per cent, above the previous week, but 38 per cent, below last year.Bread. The preliminary tabulation of the bakers&apos; and retailers&apos; returns (Table D.) of the consumption of flour for the four weeks ended September 15th (i.e., immediately before the reduction of the price of the loaf) indicates very little change from the position exhibited by the previous return. . The consumption has increased about \\ per cent, over that of the four weeks, July 22nd. to August 18th, 1917, whereas last, year the increase was about .\ per cent, in the corresponding period. The reduction from last year, which was 5^ per cent, in the four weeks ended August 18th, is approximately 4-1- per cent, in the period ended September 15th.From March this year till August every successive return showed a reduction; it was anticipated that some seasonal, increase would take place as the autumn approached, but that indicated is a little premature.
