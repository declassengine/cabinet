sonop T9S010QColonel Jonesg I i D S N n A L.^-AiW^agpRT from the MINISTRY of LABOUR on the LABOUR SITUATIONThe strike of Ironmoul&amp;ers in Scotland which has been in progress during the past three weeks haa come to an e;i4.After the mass meeting held at Claogow on the  2nd September at which it was decided to continue the strike the members of the Emergency Committee proceeded on a crusade with the object of bringing out all the other Ironmouldere in the country.   They did not obtain as much success as at one time soemed probable, for though Edinburgh struck, only a few of the men at Palkirk which is the most important oentre of the industry came out.,   During the week the strikers began to feel the pinch and subscription books were sent round to all the shops In the V7est of Scotland.   The Industrial Workers of Great Britain and the Clyde Workers Committee also subscribed, as it was realised hov; important to the rebel movement would be the consequences of a success.On Satxirday night September 29th a Conference was held at the Ministry of labour at which a deputation from the Emergency Committee was officially introduced by the executive of their Union.   It was made quite clear that the award to whioh objection was being taken could not be reopened until the proper period had elapsed.This reaffirritation oi the policy laid down   in the Minister of Labour1s notice to the strikers was made known on the Clyde and had.a good effect.   The men had been under the impression that the important nature of the work on which they are enrj&amp;7efl would force the Government to give way, but finding they had made a mistake soon began to repent of their action.   Those men who had come out at Palkirk returned to work yesterday and at an important meeting held at Glasgow during the same day it was determined that as the Award would come up fbi* revision In three v/eeks   time a general resumption of work should take place on the morrow (l/ednesday).This termination, of a motet,serious dispute is at once fortunate and important, . It -would hot be too much to .say that the eyes of all the discontented have been fixed on this stride and that had any weakness been betrayed the value of the Committee on Production would have ceased to exist,A strike of driller s occurred at Messrs, Beardmore.rs, Delinulr, on September 22nd and lasted until the 23th vhen the men agreed to return to work pending arbitration of the dispute.   At Leicester about 120 Engineers have been idle during the past \?eel: at Messrs. .Mellor, Bronley &amp; Co*s works.,.   The /trouble arose owing to the dismissal of a man who had ^refused to complete certain work which had been commenced by a. Belgian, in receipt of a considerably higher rate of pay unless he were paid the same rate.   A meeting of the Leicester iron Trades Federation took plaOe on September 26th and it was resolved to notify the Ministry of Munitions that unless negotiations were instituted at once z  eneiv.1 stride of members of the Federation would take place.   An investigation is now taking lace and the men returned to vork on Monday last.This strike hats attracted considerable attention locally as has also that of the Canaejtt V7orl:ers at rlesurs. Hart &amp; Levy,&quot; (Leicester) which, has-;noi-; &quot;been in . progress some weeks.   Over 800 employees are affectedt &apos;the romainin-^iOOO bein^ still at work.

should not he extended to civil work.   The firm refuse to make any concession but are prepared to take the strikers back on the old conditions, meanwhile they are introducing new workpeople;Some improvement has taken place in the Ulster Linen Industry though the dispute is not yet settled.   As the result of a conference held by the Minister of Labour the men expressed their readiness to return to work but the employers continued to dispute the appointment of Mr. Vesey Knox,i .C. as arbitrator and the factories acdordinsly remained closed.   On the Urgent repres-entation of the Air Board they finally agreed to open them for Government work.   The attitude of the employers in ihis case can only be regarded as deplorable, and the Ministry have decided that arbitration must proceed under Mr. Knox.In the Coalmining Industry the strike of anthracite workers at the Gwaun-oae-Gurwen Colliery, Glamorganshire, continues. The points at issue are however receiving the attention of the Coal Controller, who, owing to the complexity of the legal aspect of the case is taking professional advice before giving a decision.Several strikes on purely local matters h:we occurred at collieries in South Wales, Yorkshire, Derbyshire and Stirlingshire.The total number of strikes reported by the Statistics Department as having been in progress during the week is 49,II. DISPUTES..........mmmtmmmm mm %The Shipyard Labour Department- reports 64 cases of dispute, 10 of which involved stoppages o  r/ork and 27 of which have been successfully settled chiefly by officers of the Department.This week however no reference is made to the Clyde which is the most restless of the Shipbuilding areas.   The figures given above must not accordingly be taken to imply any improvement in the condition of this industry.The Coal Controller   has held a conference with the Miners&apos; Federation and has offered to increase his former offer of l/3d per day to l/6d at flat rates.   This has been accepted by the Executive who are referring the proposal to the local unions. Meetings have been held with the representatives of the Surface-men^ Societies and they have formally accepted an offer similar to that made to the Miners.At the request of the liiners1 Federation the Coal Controller has taken up with the Ministry of Munitions the question of a similar concession to members of the Federation working in under-takings controlled by that Department,As a result of the conference held on September 25th at the Board of Trade between the South Wales Colliery Examiners and the owners the notices which had been handed in v/ere suspended for a month pending further negotiations regarding the recognition of the Union,The War Office Contracts Department reports thirteen cases of dispute four of which have occurred during the week.   The most interesting of these cases are:- one at Manchester due to irritation at the delay in the issue of an arbitration Award and another at Leicester due to the alleged dismissal of a woman because she had been acting as a   shop steward.The ohief cause of disquiet is however the textile industry particularly in Yorkshire.   A mass meeting of operatives   was held at Bradford on September 25th and the vote in favour of handing in notices on the 4th and 5th October was unanimous.   The number of workers Involved is about 50,000 most of whom are women and the cause of the trouble insufficient wages.    The workpeople say that their earnings have only increased by from 30  - 50 &apos; during the war while the cost of living has risen nearly 100^.2./ Much
Much dissatisfaction was expressed with the last award issued hy the Chief Industrial Commissioner whioh was alleged to be inadequate.A conference is to take place today with the Scottish Council of Textile Trade Unions at which important applications in regard to increased wages will be put forward.Several disputes are reported by the Ministry of Ifanitiona none of which are however of a serious character.   That at Dobson &amp; Barlow ltd, Bolton however deserves mention as it is apparently due to the poaching of members from the General Workers&apos; Union by the Moulders1 Union under promise that skilled rates would be obtained for them.   The men are in fact doing completely unskilled work, but have demanded the rates paid to fully skilled men and have handed in their notices.During the past fortnight the Committee on Production   has heard 66 cases, 46 in London and 20 in Scotland.&apos;Two of these cases affect several thousand^municipal workers employed by a number of Lancashire and Cheshire corporations. In a number of instances workers who will be affected by the award have recently been on strike and it is hoped that the issue of the Award will lead to a more satisfactory state of affairs.ddendum A report has now been received from the Shipyard LabourDepartment with regard to conditions on the Clyde.   According io this $9 oases of dispute have been in progress during the week, three of which have led to stoppage and 23 of y/hich have been successfully settled.
III   DISTRICT K3BGHT3.London.th Western.t Midlands.Yorkshireandst m&amp;aara.inExoept for oertnin purely local troubles the position this district is normal.There has been some agitation at V/oolwioh over the alleged insufficiency of earnings in the event of air raids, but the men are now reported to be satisfied with what has been done.The receivedabolition with muchof the leavingenthusiasm.     The men say still hedged in with so many restrictions, that Hinister of Inanitions&apos; concession Is meaningless.certificate has not been that they are theThe agitation against the increased price of milk has already commenced.     The ElthamTfranch of the A.S.E. has passed a resolution calling upon the Food Controller to keep dorm the price.     Other branches are expected to follow this lead and similar movements are reported from other parts of the country.The pooifist meetings held under the auspices of the Herald League at ?insbury Park continue to attract large and Increasingly sympathetic audiences.     The attendance at the similai&quot; meetings of the Workers1 Suffrage federation held at Viucoria Park, is on the other hand usually small and hostile to the speakers.The there issituation in this area is quiet. At Portsmouth said to be discontent among the eletheitrioalin the dockyards, owing to the dilution o^Tlaoour and importation of female hands. Certain acts of wilful damage whioh have taken place are attributed to this.A mass meeting of Coalminers at peleall held on September 30th passed a resolution accepting the Coal Controllers revised offer of increased wages.     The situation is accordingly much quieter, though there are indications that the success of the miners will lead to a renewed agitation by the Engineers against the alleged Inadequacy of the 3/- award.A movement has been started at Bedford with the object of organising the war munitions volunteers, so that they may be in a stronger position for placihg&quot;their demands before the Ministry of Munitions.     Other centres of munitions work are being circularised by the local eeore-tary.The chief centre of unrest in this district has been the coal mining industry.     General approval of the Coal Controller^ proposal &quot;of a &quot;flat rate&quot; is however expressed and it is thought that the revised offer in regard to wages will be accepted.In other industries a certain restlessness is observable.    At Leicester two important strikes are in progress (see Seo&apos;tXo&quot;:i lT7^   There are al30 strikes at Kottingham and in other parts of the district,^ke railway men in Yorkshire are reported to be adverse to the extremist agitation which&quot;is being carried on in certain sections of tha 1LU.R.     They are not atpresent/
present prepared to take any drastic aotion in support of the proposals which are being out forward by the Vigilance Committees.    Recent nestings held by branches Of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen have condemned the strike suggested by Bromley, the secretary of their Union.Great efforts have been made during the past week by the various paoifist societiesj notably the Women1s Peace Crusade, but the effect is said to have been small.th Western. The situation is generally quiet, though in theMersey District the Boilermakers are still very dissatis-Tied with the recent arbitration which went against them. There is ouch vague talk of what will happen should the Committee on Production not accede to the demands ^lioh will be made when the national award oernes up for revision this month.An important Conference was held at Manchester during the week-end under the auspices of the &quot;metal, Engineering ead Shipbuilding Amalgamation Committee&quot;. The attendance was poor though the extremist shop stewards were well represented, several of the men arrested during the Hay strike being there.     Letters from the A.S.E. and other Unions were read aad in these an opinion was expressed favourable to the objects of the movement, but deprecating action at the present time.     It would appear that the official executives, realising that opinion among the rank and file is tending strongly towards amalgamation, have decided to give the movement their cautious blessing.A meeting of the H.U.R. attended by about 000 men and women was held at llanehester on Sunday,     A Resolution in terms similar to that passed in London in August by the Rank and File Tisllanoe Committee and in Liverpool last week (see last week&apos;s Report) was carried without opposition.     It was however declared that while insisting on their demands the men were in nowise advocating- a strike.Eastern. The restlessness observable during the past fewweeks among the men employed in the Shipbuilding industry seems somer&amp;at to have decreased, and the general situation is on the whole quiet.It is reported that an important conference of the Industrial Workers of the ?Torld is to be held in Newcastle during the coming- week and&quot;TSEa  in the succeeding week a conference of the I^eta!r Engineering &amp; Shipbuilding Trades is to take place.------les. Apart from a very noticeable restlessness among thecoalminers conditions are very quiet. The miners have of course been very interested in the negotiations between the Coal Controller and the Miners1 federation, but the question of Income Tax lias apparently become an even more burning topics of discussion than the proposed advance in wagesThe necessity for anti-paoifist propaganda in South Wales has for some time been apparent especially as theI.L.P /
I,L.P. which lias notoriously opposed the Tier 1b contlnu-ously increase its strength.    It is nevertheless perhaps somevihat unfortunate that the organisation which has undertaken the work of opposition should be the VUS.P.U. which has recently accjuirecl the refutation of unbalanced Jingoism and has preached hostility to the policy of the Government.j Clyde. The strike of Ironmoulders is referred to in SectionI,     This serious strike whioh continued for some three weeks has had a disturbing effect on other branches of industry.    Both Boilermakers and I&amp;igineerg ai-e very restless and talk about&apos; talcing very&amp;rasTic action if  heir demand for a 10/- increase is not granted at the next revision by the Committee on Production.    The failure of the strike, which was supported by unofficial contributions from the other trades on the Clyde, may be expected to have a sobering effect.The various extremist Labour societies have shoran great activity during the week.     The Independent Labour Party which appears almost entirely Wliave deserted Industrial for paoifist politics is reported to be making much headway and attention is called to the fact that little or no attempt has been made to counteract Its dangerous propaganda.6.
1Q2,7.     BRE33 OPINIONSThe &quot;Call&quot; deals with the subject of the Report recently published by the Sugar Commissioners. After pointing out that a supply of 24000 tons a week had been issued, thoughl4000 tons were estimated as a sufficient supply for domestic requirements the article proceeds:-   &quot;There should have been an ample &quot;supply for all.   Under these   circumstances control &quot;seems to have been most marked by its absence.   The &quot;Commission seems to have contented itself with &quot;distributing the sugar to the principle dealers and &quot;leaving them a free hand in the distribution to the &quot;people.   The result has been a sordid and &quot;unnecessary scramble for one of the necessities of &quot;life.&quot;Very adverse criticism also appears in &quot;Justice&quot; whioh contains the following.- &quot;&quot;There have all the ^tons of sugar for public consumption gone to whioh &quot;have not been consumed by the public?   Tho are the &quot;people who have been allowed to hoard sugar at the &quot;expense of the poorer families?   Long ago we &quot;demanded the rationing of the sugar supplies.   The &quot;report of the sugar Commission shows that the &quot;rationing of sugar is imperative if there is to be &quot;anything like equitable distribution.&quot;&quot;Forward&quot; attacks the Potato order of the food Controller whioh fixes a minimum price of Id per lb. and has resulted in an advance of price from 10-d to l/2d per stone.   The paper writes:- &quot;Do you catch &quot;hold of that? Potatoes were too oheap: not enough &quot;skin for the farmers, and if farmers do not get big &quot;skin, landlords cannot raise rents.   So, hey pre3tol &quot;it becomes an offence against tho Defence of tho &quot;Realm Act to get cheap potatoes, and the prico is &quot;arbitrarily raised by 4d per stone.   The poor think &quot;they are getting food controlling.   They are.&quot;An immediate reduction of food prioos by 5q  has been demanded by the Rhondda District minors (Western Kail) and the Belfast Branch of tho A.S.E. (Belfast News Letter); in each case the demand is accompanied by a throat of a strike unless the resolution is accepted.The agitation against excessive representation of Trading interests on food control Committees is reported from many quarters.   The &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; also reports that the unrest In the co-operative movements on this question has resulted in arrangements for holding a National Emergency Conference, and comments:-. &quot;The recent decision of &quot;the annual co-operative congress to launch the &quot;movement into politics giveH point to this &quot;arrangement.   Another matter not without signi^jcsiwe &quot;in this direction, is the fixing of the date of.the &quot;Conference An the middle of October, so as to &quot;synchronise with the re-asseiibLing of Parliament&quot; *&quot;Common Sense&quot; quotes a letter from a correspondent of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; complaining of the replacement of Durhaia coal for Exeter by morw
expensive coal for &quot;Sales and the Central -Counties of England and says;-   &quot;The coal taken away is being sent &quot;to London.   Is there any reason why the poor in our &quot;district5 shouad suffer for the benefit of a rich city &quot;like London*&quot;   Complaints of a similar Character appear in the &quot;Glasgow Eera3dn from the GaseOompanies of the North Eastern Lieerict of Scotland.The &quot;labour Leader&quot; comments on the Coal Controllers final offer as follows:- &quot;in the first place, by basing &quot;the wages rate on the cost of living it Suggests a dim &quot;recognition that in such bargains Labour ought not to be &quot;regarded as a commodity but as full blooded human life... E....The same thoughc works in the flat rate of increases &quot;offered to the skill led and unskilled ra*r&amp;jaen alike.   V/e &quot;hope for&quot;the future of&quot;the Labour move cent that there &quot;will be no murmuring here among the skilled men....&quot;.&quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; also comments on the offer from the same point of view.The abolition Of these Cerfiticates with effect from the 15th October has been welcomed in all quartersu   On this subject the &quot;Hew Witness&quot; writes:-   &apos;T.t..co This &quot;important concession has been wrung from the Ministry &quot;of Munitions through the efforts of the shop stewards, &quot;who, elected by the employees in the various factories &quot;take steps to secure the remedying of abuses without &quot;reference to Trade Union officials or central &quot;SxecutiveSr i c o s u c dt cannot be   too often pointed out &quot;that such ameliorations as the men have obtained have &quot;been due. not to the good offices of labour ministers &quot;and other performing politicians, but to the efforts of &quot;the stewards and the increasing importance of the &quot;Rank &quot;and Pile&quot; movement in the factories and workshops0&quot; An enquiry instituted by the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; among Trade Union officials of the Engineering industry has elicited the opinion that the abolition of the Certificate will.not result in muoh change of T/ork among the men.The speeches of Dr. Addison and of Mr.3.E.,Roberts on the subjects of Reconstruction rnd After war employment have received much attention in the Daily Press but haire curiously escaped remark in most of the labour papers.   Dr. Addison1 s proposals are criticised in the &quot;Labour Leader&quot; which says:-   &quot;Dr Addison lays &quot;emphasis upon the desirability of closer co-operation &quot;between Capital and Labour, but shows no least &quot;recognition that efforts at co-operation while the rock &quot;bottom of the industiial system remains the samo - the Sexploitation of Labour in the interests of as &quot;unproductive class - aro bound to end in futility.... &quot;The Minister, r undoes not omit the importance of the &quot;housing question which, by the way* has long passed the&apos; &quot;aoute stage, and is already a national scandal,wThe replies of the Central Powers to the proposals from &quot;the Vatican are discussed in the Labour papers of the week.   The &quot;Labour Leader&quot; writes:-   &quot;The tornado of &quot;insult with which they have been received by our &quot;Imperialist leader-write&amp;s may be regarded as a measure &quot;of their political importance.   7e doplore the fact that &quot;the Central powers do not offer concrete terms, especiaiy
&quot;with regard to Belgium, as a basis of settlement.   It &quot;cannot be denied, however, that they accept the general &quot;principles for which the Allies are fighting.....The &quot;only hope for civilisation is that, in every country &quot;the people take the work of Esking peace out of the &quot;hands of the power-drunk Imperialist few whose made &quot;and conflicting ambitions made and now prolong the Wer&quot;.The &quot;Bradford Pioneer&quot; saysx- &quot;Austria has replied &quot;to the Pope - and expressed bar willingnoss to confer. &quot;Germany has done the same.   Whatevor fault our own war &quot;makers may find with either document that all important &quot;fact remains.......The British Press already is all&quot;but unanimous in its thumbs-down attitude.....The&quot;attempt is once again being made to swindle us out of &quot;poace.   Will it onoe more succeed?&quot;5?he hCall&quot; has a leader entitled &quot;A Pope^ Truco or &quot;a Peopled Peace&quot; in the course of whioh the following appears:-   &quot;The German reply, like the Popors Uoto, show  &quot;that   tho cause of whicb tho demand for the &quot;Stockholm &quot;Conference was tho symbol, boars fruit in middle &quot;Europe.   The Reply endorses the Peace resolution adopted &quot;toy the Reichstag on July 19th embodying the formula of &quot;a settlement without annexations or indemnities - which &quot;indicates ratli^Y&amp;i&amp;iamentary control than is now in &quot;vogue in Britain.   On Monday last tho British press &quot;was fUning because the roply did not promiso &quot;specifically to evacuate certain territories now In tho &quot;possession of the Troops of the Central Powers........&quot;According to Mr. Lloyd George and Gonoral Botha tho &quot;future of the German Golonies in Africa is   matter for &quot;the peace Conference.   If Germany l^akea tho sarao view &quot;with regard to Territorios in her occupation, she can &quot;at least plead the Allies example&quot;.Tile &quot;Clarion&quot; has an article of which the general tenour may bo gathered from the following extract:-&quot;Tho Eohcnzollorn butchors have but to compose a &quot;document compact of all the Killenial Pacifist phrases &quot;and Free Tr&amp;do shibboleths, and the oager pacifist &quot;rushes to seize their bleody hands with frenzied cries &quot;of brotherhood and fraternity.&quot;gottsing The agitation on tho subject of housing continues,tho question being doalt with in many papers. Attention is also concentrated on the problem of cottages for tho accommodation of rural labour, interest having been stimulated by the convention of a conference at tho Local Government Board,Among tho Places whoro the housing question has boon discussed at mootings aro Bradford, Barrow, Melford (Suffolk), Darlington, Taunton, Bristol, Lancaster, Maestog,.Liverpool and Lloyn.tatc Subsidies A considerable amount of hostile criticism has^ boon directed to an address delivered by Hr. L. A. Paishof tho Commercial Intelligence Dopartmont, Board of Trado, at a meeting of tho Birmingham Brass Jlasteis1 fAasociation.   The &quot;Call&quot; writes:-   &quot;Wo aeo thon that the Government has adopted an active pelicy of promoting
"the formation of combines and trusts.....We see in "it the legical development of Capitalism. The "Government, watching the interests of the Capitalist "class which it represents, has evidently undertaken "to speed up the development. The Trust is the final "form of Capitalism". The "New Age" also criticises the proposals, from the point of view of Labour:- "As for the wage carners, their case under a system of "combines, each intent on reducing the costs of "production (of which the Chief is Labour) can be "easily imagined. Their area of choice of employer will "infallibly be restricted by the system of the Trade "card condomming them to work or starve at the "discretion of the combines. All the evils of a "bureaucracy together with these of Capitalism will "descend upon them." The Postal and Telegraph Record" refers to the subject in an article headed" "Brass" and Profit" It says "The subsidising of capitalists in "combination is a new phase in the doings of our "democratic Government.....Any stop in the direction "of subsidy out of taxation for the benefit solely of "the Capitalist or profiter is a negation of all the "professions of our present governing classes."

? and ?

In the course of an article entitled "Why Labour distrusts Bureaucracy" the "Yorkshire Factory Times" writes:- "One sinister phase of this matter is the "curious demoralization it has engendered. Loading men "who offer counsels of prudence and patriotism are "inevitably suspected of being state agents, or at "least of being aspirants to "jobs". There is a "continual going over of trusted Union officials to "the Government service."


V.   GENERAL REMARKS.&quot;-fliaea.&quot;. The series of articles on the &quot;Ferment of1-he Revolution&quot; were concluded in the &quot;Times&quot; of the 28thluTIonary  September.   Reference to (tbe first two of these articles aent. was made in last week1a Report. The cjuestion of the*^ revolutionary section of Labour was dealt with in SectionY of the Report for 5th September, and the criticises then made with reference to Professor Arnold&quot;a pacer on &quot;Labour in Revolt&quot;, still hold $ood.   g^e writer of the &quot;Times&quot; articles has fallen into the same error of oonfusion.   His classification of the inhabitants of the country into two nations of equal size with opposite aims is a gross exaggeration, and is indeed unsupported by his own statement in the first article as to the loyalty and patriotism of the Labour Party Oonferenoe, the Tra e Union Congress, the leaders, and the majority of the wage earners.At the same time the articles are of value in the emphasis which they plaoe on the dealers of the present position in respect of wages demands.   There is a serious and ^rowing tendency on the part of the organised industries to bid against each other for increases in wages and to support those demands by a throat of a strike, and, in certain casos by &quot;direct action&quot;, unpreluded by any warning;   The official leaders find it impossible to resist the demands of their members, when they can point to other industries with a higher average warre level receiving larger advances than they themselves have been $ranted.   The unofficial leaders of the rebel movement, of course, make the most of their opportunity to onoour^e continually growing demands, but&quot;it is a complete mistake to suppose with the writor in &quot;The Times&quot; that these demands are part of a deliberate oolicy and not in the main the outcome of totally abnormal eoonomic conditions.   The whole question requires to be revic ed in the li ht of the existing financial and industrial situation, and the Kinister of Labour ia at present engaged in collecting tho materials on which&quot; such a review nay be based.   In the meanwhile it ia necessary tc emphasise the importance of maintaining Awards, even if at the expense of a temporary reduction of output, if an unofficial strike takes places as recently occurred among tho Iromaouloers in Scotland.   Without Union funds no strike is likely to last Ion/?, an  to weaken tbs standing of Awards is to undermine arbitration altogether.JD. J. SHACKLETOiif.iiIHI3TRY 01 LABOUR, 60T? tik -- u -
