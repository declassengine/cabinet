^   370(Ibis document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government).,\ r? t n2190. - WAR     CABINET.CONSCIENTIOUS   OBJECTORS.IJemo rand urn by Ilr. Walter Long.(Circulated with reference, to the Memorandum by the Secretary of state for War - G.T. 2167).I have read Lord Salisbury&apos;s memorandum on the Conscientious Objectors.As I was Llinister in charge of both the Military Service Bills I think I can speak with authority as to the intention of the Government of that day.    It was1 that no man who had a genuine, conscientious objection to taking human life should be compelled to join the Army.   But, short of this, everybody who came under the Bill was to be compelled to do his share.I have no objection to offer to Lord Salisbury1s proposals, assuming it is decided to legislate.: But I desire to state quite clearly that while I fully recog-nise that there are inconsistencies in the law as it stands, I do not believe the men of &quot;high character and lofty aims&quot; have any claim on the sympathy of Parliament.   They have their remedy in their own hands.i/hat of those who are being dailjr compelled to serve? Hen of notorious indifferent health: brothers of men already serving, in some cases the fourth or fifth member of a family, some of whom have already made the great sacrifice? ; For these there is to be no consideration; except in Ireland ?/here all escape, and are allowed to enrol in forces hostile to the Crown.
Many of our people are &quot;war-weary&quot;, many are sorely tried by Government action, but I have found no evidence of any desire to abate our efforts till a real Peace has been secured and at the same time I find unmistakeable evidence of the strongest and bitterest feeling against the Conscientious Objector.   If, therefore, the Government decide to introduce legislation, I should be very much surprised if they are not compelled to review the whole situation; and I should maintain the status quo. &quot;(3d)  alter H. Long.1st October 1917.
