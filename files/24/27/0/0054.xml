CRBT. .T.2154.WAR CABINET COMMITTEE ON MAN-POWER AND RECRUITING.f . DIRECT C OMHUNIC AT I ON WITH LOCAL TRIBUNALS.,V Notice to All Government&apos; Departments.I am dire6ted by Lord Milner, who acts as Chairman of the Cabinet Committee on Man-Power and Recruiting to say that the &quot;attention of his Committee has been drawn to the fact that in many cases officials of Government Departments are writing direct to local Tribunals, recommending the exemption by such Tribunals of men employed by their Department.&quot;;The Chairmen of Tribunals have in several cases commented unfavorably on this practice; and in order to avoid this in future the Committee have decided to recommend that the best course Is for Government Departments interested to represent direct to the Minister of National Service the facts of any case which they wish to support.   The Minister of National Service would investi-gate the oase and if he Is satisfied that it is in the National interest that the man should remain in his civilian employment, he would instruct the National Service representative on the Tribunals (at present the Military representative) to recommend the Tribunal to grant exemption to the man for such period as may be necessary.(Sd).    W. Ormsby Gore,Secretary to Lord Kllner^- Man-Power Committee, &amp; Assistant Secretary, 2, Whitehall Gar dens, S,.Pf. . War Cabinet.29th September,1917.
