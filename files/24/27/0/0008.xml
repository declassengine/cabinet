F0R0E3 AT CORK AND QUEENSTOWN,Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.2070 The memoran&amp;rjir  of the First Lord of the Admiralty on thesubject of disturbances which have occurred between sailorsof the United States Navy and men of the civilian populationat Cork and Queenstown deals with a question willoh has givena good deal of trouble to the police and the local popu-lation and has been much discussed in the IriEh newspapers.The occasion of the trouble is that the American seamen who-  withcome ashoro in very high spirits and/abundance of pocket money prove very attractive to the young women of Cork and Queenstcwn/   The free and easy relationships which spring up naturally cause disquiet and annoyance in some quarters. The preacher at Queenstown Cathedral whose denunciation the First Lord cites is not alone in the view that all the philandering that goes on is by no means platonlc.   Besides the legitimate apprehensions expressed by some of the guardians of public and private morals there were for a short time demonstrations by so-called Vigilance Committees of young men who sat themselves to separate the women from the seamen.-   As the reeult. a       arrays occurred and one youth whose sweetheart had gone off with a sailor received a fatal blow from the sailor0    The police of the Royal Irish Con-stabulary at the outset found it difficult to shepherd the-orowds which this state of things produced, and Cork was put out of bounds for a time by the commanding officer of the U.SL, Navyu   The Inspector-General upon becoming aware
of the facts from the reports of the local police gave directions.of which I was informed which seemed to me sufficient to meet the needs of the case so far as public order was concerned.. I believe this action has been effective.   I hope that a somewhat exaggerated view has been taken of the international aspect of the incidents in.question and if this is not so and there is something more to be done which could be directed from Dublin I think it is to be regretted.that representations via Whitehall have occupied numerous.days, whereas a message to Dublin would have-so-cured full attention to the wishes of the naval authorities, British or Allied, in an hour.,   The Inspector-General has his office In Dublin Ceotle. .It is no dcubt the fact that Sinn Feinere formed the bulk of the so-called Vigilance Committees. . They gained no credit for it from the local people who generally took a good tempered view of the situation. . They were also soen in a very unfavourable light by the men from the. United States1 ships.(Initialled)   E.K.D.,23rd Saptember, 191?.
