WAR   CABINET.FOOD   CONTROL   AND   LABOUR   UNREST i.Memo; from the^Ministry of Food.The Reports of Commissions of Inquiry into Industrial   &apos; Unrest laid emphasis on two tasks as requiring to he under-taken by the Food Controller :(l)   To control for the period of the War all essential foodstuffs and to limit the profits derivable from all transactions and sales relating thereto;(2)   To take steps to reduce the cost of the necessaries of life by means of a State subsidy if necessary; or,if that ia not practicable, to convince the public that the present high prices are inevitable.Control.     All the principal foodstuffs have been brought under control, that is to say:- Bread and Flour; Meat, Potatoes, Sugar, Tea, Milk, Butter, Cheese and Bacon0   Control has further been extended to certain subsidiary foods such as Jam, Oatmeal, Dried Peas and Beans, Chocolates and Sweet-meats, and also to Feeding Stuffs for livestock.Limitation of Profits.     Prices have been:, or are being, fixed at every stage of production and distribution of con-trolled commodities from: the stockyard or barn to the shop counter.   The speculative middleman has been eliminated and the charges that may be made by the necessary middleman and the retailer are being defined and regulated by fixing prices or profits.   The action taken in respect of each principal food is described in greater detail below.Result of Control.     This is most obvious in the case of the three   moat important foods: bread,, meat and potatoes.Bread.     The price of the 4 lb loaf for cash over the counter is now 9d, and of the 2 lb loaf 4 d..   In some districts these loaves are being sold for loss.   A quartern of flour costs 8 d.   This means a reduction of 2($&apos;5% on the prices previously-charged.   It will coBt the Exchequer at least  40,000,000. and may cost more-.Meat.     The prices to be paid for live cattle have been fixed on a descending scale so as to show a 20/25$ reduction next January as compared with last July.   Butchers&apos; profits are limited to 2 -d per lb, or 20% on their fortnightly turn-over, whichever is less..   These measures should ultimately secure an average reduction in the retail price of meat equivalent to the reduction in the purchase price of cattle. Some time must elapse before the effect&apos;of these arrangements is fully felt; but the price has already fallen to an appreciable extent.   The price of store cattle has since July 18 been lowered from  2 to  3 per head/   At -Shrewbury Irish store cattle in September sold at 5/- per cwt. liveweight less than in August, and English at 6/- per cv,&apos;t.     Ab regards feed-ing stuffs, oil-sake has fallen  2 to  3 a ton, and it is anticipated that a further reduction will take place of the same amount.
Wholesale prices of meat have been reduced as follows : -English long 3ides 1/5 per stone; Scotch short sides l/- per stone; English mutton 1/5, and Soot-ch mutton 1/lQ.   It is impossible to say at present how far this reduction has affected retail prices, owing .to. the difference in the cuts selected; hut it is clear that some reduction has been effected and that this will gradually be increased.Potatoes.   As a result of the Prime Ministers guarantee to growers of  6 a ton,  the acreage under potatoes has been considerably increased and there is an abundant crop,    The retail price of these is controlled and will, as a rule, be about Id a lb.    It may be more in some districts where transport charges, are large and less in others where they are small.The action taken on other foodstuffs is as follows:-Su/?;ar.   Complaints in relation to this have centred on distribution rather than prices, and the new scheme of sugar distribution is designed to secure that such supplies as are available shall be distributed without suspicion of favour. It safeguards the position of the resident householder whether he be rich or poor.   The retail price though not fixed by statutory order is controlled by the Sugar Commission in such a way as to leave a reasonable margin only to all dealers concerned.Mi^lkj,   It has been necessary to sanction an increase in the price of milk in accordance with a pledge given by the Government last Spring, with a view to securing, an adequate BUPPly during the Winter,   prices are, however,  fixed at all stages.   Further, Local Food Control Committees&quot;are empowered to make their ov;n arrangements for distribution and the increased cost of production&apos;will not be.allowed to interfere with the supply at reasonable prices to young children and invalids.Tea.    The present retail prices of tea falling under the conTrol scheme range from 2/4 to 3/- per lb.   A certain amount of tea is not under control.   Arrangements are being made to purchase, on behalf of the Government the whole supplies needed for this country, and so to extend control over all tea.    The tea so purchased will&apos; be brought home in requisitioned ships at appreciably reduced rates of freight and there will be a substantial reduction in retail prices. A temporary shortage of tea is probably inevitable, but. adequate supplies will be forthcoming later.Cheese.   Imported American and Canadian Cheese of good quality is sold retail at the fixed price of 1/4 per lb. The prices of English cheese are being adjusted for the purpose of encouraging farmers to make more.Butter.-  Importation is bein* taken over by the Govern-ment.   Pnce&quot;s or profits are fixed provisionally at all . st age 3.Bacpn^Hams^ and Lard..   The import of these articles has been or is being taken over by the Government,  and prices will be fixed at all stages as soon as possible.   Here again, owing to world shortage and to increased Army demands, a
temporary shortage of supplies is probably inevitable.Why Prices are fcigh.    Increased currency causes an increased demand for-&apos;goods.   If currency is multiplied faster than the supply of commodities is multiplied,  the result is a rise in prices,    Whenever you get more money and fewer goods,  the buying power of money will fall ana prices will rise.If by money is meant everything which is accepted in payment for good3,  there is more money in the country than ever before, and a great deal of thir money is spent in buying food.   And there is less food to buy forvarious reason&apos; There is increased consumption by the Armies in the field; there is reduced production owing to shortage of labour at home; ships carrying foodstuffs are sunk) and there is a scarcity sf available tonnage to bring in more food,There is, in fact, a genuine world shortage.   80 far as we are dependent on foreign countries for our supplies the-most we can do is to n:et what Y/e can as cheaply as possible, but the price must be paid.   The object of the Government is to see that supplies are forthcoming &amp;o far as they are available, and that the prices are not excessive.It is, moreover, beyond the power of the Food Controller in this country to fix prices in other countries upon which we depend for a large proportion of supplies of many articles.27th September,  1917.
