(Circulated with reference to War Cabinet 242A, Minute 3.)Metropolitan Police Office, flew Scotland Yard, S.W,2nd October, 1917,It is somewhat difficult to define the feeling amongst the community caused by these air-raids. -On the whole they bear their infliction philosophically and without much repining. They are willing to believe that . much is being done to safeguard them but they would like to be able to point to tangible results.     If as a result of a raid they could be assured that a couple of the raiding aeroplanes had been aocounted for, the public would, I think, deem this atonement for what they had suffered.To a man they desire to see thi3 air war carried into the enemy&apos;s country and I believe when they know this is being effectively done they will accept even more resignedly than at present such visitations as may be inflicted upon them.I believe it to be a growing belief amongst the public that of late more satisfactory measures have been taken for the protection of London against air raiders.   Ho-one knows the details of such measures, but the impression has gradually gained ground to this effect.The more timorous amongst the public are much relieved in mind by being able to take refuge in safe Air Raid Shelters.   I have had a return compiled which shows that there is aooommo-dation in these shelters for about half a million people and additional buildings are being made available for the purpose.It must be remembered that in many households the father of the family ie away, and the wife goes with her children to the nearest shelter, no&apos;&apos;j solely because it is safer than her home, but partly because she gets company there and the . moral support which comes from association with others.
There-are many aliens amongst those who. go to these shelters and they, I thine, it must he admitted, are genuinely under the influence ox terror.   Many of them belong to nationalities tiat hays always been oppressed, and possibly as a censeonercc cf this, they become more easily intimidated than cur own people.If these visitaticnr continue, the people, in my judgment, will,, while accepting this as part of their hard lot, be very insistent that more energetic measures&apos; must be taken for their protection, and for the punishment of their assailants.I wish it to be clearly understood that most classes of the community, especially the poorer classes, feel in fact somewhat terrorised by these repeated air-raids.(Signed)     E* R, HEKRY.. 1/10/17.
