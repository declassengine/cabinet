(Shis Document is the property of Eis Britannio Majesty&apos;s Government). C R E 2.^2172. g AB     CABINET.PEACE   NEGOTIATIONS.Memorandum by the secretary of State for the,Colonies with regard to Papers P.22. and Gel, 2145.The War Cabinet will remember that the Representatives of the Dominions on the Imperial war Cabinet pressed strongly that no Peace negotiations should be entered upon without first con-suiting them and giving them an opportunity to express their views.In these circumstances I venture to ask that this matter may be considered before any decision is arrived at.   It would be easy, I think, to put the case fco the Dominions without going into details.(Sd) Walter H. Long.29th-September 1917.
