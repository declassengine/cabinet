Intelligence Bureau, - ----     .-- Department of Information.3CRET.-- B/12. Sept. 27th 1917.MemorandumonPolitical Conditions in Austria-Hungary and Germany.The following has been received from s. usually reliable source:-n$.B.   The deputy referred tp in the text is not a man of much Jreight, and has long been noljrious for his wild personal outbursts. Ie is a Jew who has Magyarised his name, but though a violent Jingo e stands pretty far to the Left, and so he is doubtless in touch with radical movements in Berlin and ViennaTj_ Sept. 17thLuring the recent 10 days or so a very prominent Hungarian deputy (has been staying here with whom I have had several conversations upon which the following report is founded.As regards the P?;rliamentary situation in Hungary there is no need for me to add anything to what I had reported in former letters.     The Wokerle Cabinet Is considered as another experiment viewed rather sus-fliciously by all Parties.   The &quot;franchise-block&quot; - meaning the minority-are not fully convinced that Dr. T7ekerle will fulfill their expectation whilst the majority - Count Tisza&apos;s Labour Party - are marking time to see whether the Premier will aporoaoh them with an offer o^ compromise. It is believed that rather than appeal to the electorate Count Tisza will consent, in the end-, to a somewhat more extended scheme of fran-ohise reform whilst Dr. Wekerle, first of all bent upon the materialisa-tion of his economic programme, will avail himself of the assistance of &amp; majority which in economic questions will prove mor  reliable than the two groups of the Independence Party promise to be.     In this connection &quot;j-t is of interest to note, that Df. !l/ekerle has assured Count Karolyi&apos;s Party that he was by no means a partisan of the Central-Europe scheme and that even the Emr^ejor-Eing had clearly expressed his aversion to giving his consent to a treaty embodying such a scheme.     This informs-tion ia the more authentic, as my informant had been charged by Dr.
I    . . i 177\7ekerle to impart it to Count Zarolyi, whom - on his way here - he was to meet in Germany.   It is, however, still premature to say upon what conditions the economic arrangement with Germany will he signed. The Germans work at high-pressure to obtain not only the amplest facilities for their industries aid banking interests - the establish-ment in Austria-Hungary of branches of their foremost banks is one of the conditions most objected to - but a reform of Austrian and Hungarian commercial legislation so as to make it identic with the German mer-cantile code which, in ultima ratio, would mean not only the unifor-mity but the unification of judicature.     Thus it is not so much the question of tariff - in this respect not even the principles have, so far, been agreed upon - as such suggestions as make it obvious that Germany is trying to introduce at least the eoonomic part of &quot;Central Europe&quot;. which action has induced the Austro-Hungarian authorities to fight the Germans by the most efficient weapon in their power - by procrastination.     In this they have so far succeeded by referring every possible detail to committees of experts;   and if it depends upon the negotiators on the Austro-Hungarian side the conference will certainly outlast the war.     Dr Wekerle!s purpose is to complete the arrangementJwith Austria, to consolidate the financial situationIkin Hungary and then to proceed to the improvement of the currency. Meanwhilevthe conferences with Germany may go on on some side-track as slowly as&apos; ever possible.As regards the domestic situation in Hungary I am informed.11that the Emperor-King^ endeavour to prevent dissatisfaction from grew-ing inti disaffection is meeting with very little success.    The youngMonarches sincerity is not doubted;   and though it certainly makes a good impression when he releases the oldest classes, increases the rate of sustenance of soldiers1 families and orders sons of families that had been struck by repeated losses to do service behind the front -
1 7the craving for peace and the terror at the prospect of a new winter-campaign gave got too strong a hold on the popular feeling to he assuaged by some well meant conciliatory measures. My informant belongs to the most radical of Hungarian parties and he is himself a man of easily excited temperament that made him the protagonist of most of those frequent wild scenes In the Chamber.   Keeping this in mind, it is not without interest to note his view about the possible evolution in the near future. In his opinion there will be no development worth mentioning till well in the middle of October.     But he firmly believes that if by that time peace has not become tangible, popular movements in favour of a speedy ending of the war will grow irrepressible not only in Hungary, but in Austria and Germany also.    Asked upon what grounds he based this statement my informant said:In my opinion it is no longer the question of food, which has become more tolerable.   In Hungary and in Austria the utter weariness of war has for Its principal causes the disruption of family-ties and the gloomy financial putlook.     There is too much money circulating in the country and just the affluence of means makes people nervous as to their real value.   There are no poor people in Austria-Hungary at present and many more rich ones than we can bear.   But everybody has the vague feeling that the standard of life has become so expensive that it will be impossible to keep it up and still more impossible to readjust it to normal conditions without a very violent shaking of the national life.   These conditions obtain with us and with the Germans, and in all three countries the moral is deteriorated by the lack of a visible and popular aim of war. Our people, heroes as long as they are called upon to&apos; defend their own soil, are bare of any enthusiasm when fighting abroad.   And it is the same with the Austrians.   In Germany, however, my impressions were of a different kind.   The German soldier has been fighting
1 7Q3. i oWabroad during tho vhole time of the war.   Ho felt himself a Roman conqueror and he liked it.     By and by, as German politicians who know the feeling at the front told me, there were two different currents noticeable:   (a) Soldiers who went on fighting for lust of conquest, and   (b) such as sav. the futility of advance with regard to peace.     The number of the latter has steadily been increasing, whilst the former have become avare of the movement at home for peace without annexation.   They are discouraged and for this reason clamouring for the end.   Thus, the people in Berlin say, the home population have discouraged the army which now imparts its weariness to the hinterland.    It is a vicious circle out of which Germany cannot extricate herself.    The situation, at least as regards the political world, has become unbearable.    There is more hostility, more suspicion between annexatiohist and ncn-annexationist than between German and American - who^ at present, is the pet enemy. It is impossible that a violent clash should not occur during the next session of the Reichstag, and the Radicals (It is significant that my informant laid stress upon the fact that he did not mean the Socialists) firmly believe that if they carried the conflict Into the street they would have the working classes with them. This they are resolved to do as soon as they have the guarantee of a support by the masses in Vienna and Budapest.In Berlin it is maintained that the Kaiser is a broken man. He is said to have completely lost his power of volition. Parliamentary people who saw P/ilhelm II during the recent crisis assert that he was unable to discuss any subject in a connected way, that he carefully avoided contradicting but agreed with the opinions of annexationists as well as with those of a contrary mind.      He seemed more afraid of Ludendorff than of popular pressure, and though obviously intending to satisfy everybody, gave
the impression of a man who, as it were, v.as labouring under a hypnotic influence.   And what struck his interlocutors most was his eagerness to convince them that behind any &quot;jump in the dark&quot; there lurked the danger of anarchy &quot;a la russe&quot;.Here I remarked to my Informant that, if the Kaiser be of such a state of mind, it seemed to me not very probable that he would yield to a pressure originating in the street.   But his friends in Berlin seem optimistic.   They believe that the dissatisfaction at the front has already matured to such a degree that it needed only the impulse of a visible action at home to make it explode.   But they think this would not be necessary, and they would rather not have it for fear of discrediting the honour of the German army.   But they are disposed to believe that as soon as the development in Berlin affords a clear survey of forces, the annexationists will be forced to see that they form a negligible minority and in this case they will give in.   The more so as all their predictions as to the effect of the submarine action will have proved false and there will be no more means left to keep the artificial enthusiasm gloYving.Michaelis Is not taken seriously.   He is said to have no mind of his own in spite of his solemn statement to the contrary.   He is the &quot;Vertrauensmann&quot; of Ludendorff and politically entirely under the influence of Helfferich.   The Radicals, however, believe that Dr von Ktihlmann will be strong enough to impress the Chancellor with his own ideas about foreign policy and that in this the new Secretary of State is the more likely to succeed, as he has been assured of the assistance of Bavaria in the Bundesrat.This opinion is, according to my informant, not shared in Vienna. Count Czernin seems to believe that neither Ludendorff nor Helfferich will admit of an independent foreign policy as long as they do not know that they are beaten.     Nor does he trust Dr von Kuhlmann
1b * a27.9.17.unconditionally.      The Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister has had a very good impression of his German colleague, hut he found him absolutely Ignorant of Austro-Hungarian affairs and rather inclined to consider the non-German nationalities In Austria as a quantite negligeable.
