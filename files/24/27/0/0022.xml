11192OPERATITIONS.Promt- General Barter, Russia-.ToC I -1G i SWar Office-:.   Repeated Ambassador.23rd September) 1917 *12., 56 a-,itu1267-.   22nd-.       12,56, a,m,(Group apparently omitted).     With Alexieff this morning.    Sovietis largely in their hands-     If Soviet insists Kerenski reverses decisions which have been previously made.   Alexieff has insisted that there shall bo no members of Soviet attached to Headquarters but Soviet will probably insist on this.     In the Soviet Bolshiviki and Menshiviki are fighting for supremacy.     If latter wins it will be possible to work, but if the former it will be much more difficult, but will still be possible..     This does not necessarily mean the end of vrar:    Bolshiviki have not sufficient power to lead whole country and Government.     A Bolshiviki outburst is imminent, v and if the Government shows firmness it will be a good thing as order cannot be restored without bloodshed..      The sooner this is done the better.     Government Is entirely led by its own political aims., and will probably appoint officers holding these beliefs to command of higher formations Irrespective of their military worth.   Alexieff is leaving his post today-.     His (l group apparently omitted) will not allow him to remain-.     As soon as Government takes more sane and honest view of the Korniloff affair he will return.against Government., but they will insist on their present land laws, being maintained and that Government take more honest view ofdaily becomes stronger and has gained in the last weeks. GovernmentThe Cossacks will not make trouble on Don and will not- goKaledin1s actions-Chief reason of the bad state of railways islack of fuel and fall in the production of raw material,     Alsoabsence of any strong governing power and lack of co-operation amongstsubordinate
subordinate organizations which do what they like.     Also disinclination to work and lack of discipline.     This applies in an equal&quot;degree to entire national situation.Alexieff considers that mass of men will remain in the trenches in winter but that there will be excesses and many deserters.     He thinks that allied representatives should make strong representations to Kerenski in order to make him take necessary measures to restore order, which at present are not/being taken.New Chief of the Staff, General Dukhonin, is an exceed-ingly capable officer.     He was Chief of the Staff on&apos;S.W. Front and proved himself brilliant.     New Q.M.G. Diterlcchs is. also a brilliant officer,.     He was Q.M.G. of 3rd Army when a Colonel and ran the Army.     Later he commanded Russian troops&apos; at Salonika,     He says it is impossible to work under present circumstances but if Alexieff comes back it will be possible.     Otherxvise he would have to resign his post and many other officers would do the same.     Chief of the Staff relies much on &amp;t Colonel Meliavln who has always been with him.     He has come here.
