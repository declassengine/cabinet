&quot;&quot;From-l-   General Ballard, Jassy) Roumanla. To.   5-   D.M.I., War Office.B.A.734 cipher. Sept .24th.Barratt and Keyes have returned from visit to 8th and 9th Armies.     They visited from Dniester to Sucheava.1, The spirit of the 8th Army considerably betterthan the 9tn and in spite of events in Russia has improved in last month,     Most officers agreed that committees were unavoidable and were helping.     Some regiments have battle committees, who urge men to fight and dig,     9th Army depressed and more affected by politics but better than a month ago. Some divisions are very uncertain 7th rifle division, committee has passed resolution censuring Kerenski&apos;s government as not sufficiently socialistic.2, Order of battle same as wired on Sept,1st-,   Frontline trench from Dniester to and including Sereth good.     Fair 2nd and excellent 3rd line position; latter in good order. South of Sereth Russian trench weak, but enemy trench equally bad. Liaison in 9th Army poor.   All officers emphasize bad influence of drafts, which consist largely of unpunished deserters and untrained youths.Officers state depot battalions are hotbeds ofpolitics,4, It is the general opinion of officers thatprovided there is no failure of supplies of food and clothing, men may remain in trenches for winter but men are easily swayed and vary from day to day.     At the moment nearly all of the officers are cheerful, but this was before they heard of Alexeieff&apos;s retirement which I am afraid will have a bad effect. Prospects in northern Moldavia are on the whole better than I had expected,5. I understand that General Golovin from Chief ofStaff on Roumanian Front has been ordered to command of the 3rd Army,    At first he refused but the order was enforced.    No successor has yet been mentioned In his place.25.9,17. 10.40 a.m.
