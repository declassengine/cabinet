Memorandum by the Secretary of State of War,With reference to War Cabinet 238 (8).,.. I circulate a memorandum prepared by General Belfield and Lord Newton(l) Proposals were made by us in November 1915,. for the mutual exchange of all incapacitated prisoners-of-war and for a general exchange of other prisoners in equal numbers.The Turkish Government accepted the first of these proposals &quot;in principle&quot; and returned a non-committal answer to that for a general exchange.   On the advice of the American Ambassador at Constantinople the latter question was not pressed until, a definite agreement for. the exchange of incapacitated had been reached.Notwithstanding all our efforts we were unable to induce the Turks to move in the matter, and in September, 1916, they proposed that an exchange of incapacitated should take place by way of Sweden.(2)   The Swedish proposal was manifestly lout of the question and we then suggested that a ,British hospital ship- should be employed for the transport of incapacitated. Turks from Egypt to a port in Asia Minor where the British.(including Indians) could be embarked.Towards the end of 1916 the Turkish Government agreed to the employment of a neutral ship for the transfer of prisoners but all endeavours to obtain such a ship were fruitless, and eventually they agreed to the use of a hospital ship and stated that the British incapacitated numbered only 11. *, This was palpably absurd;    the state of health of many ofour men was known to be very bad and the rate of mortality to be excessive.   The diversion of a hospital ship from important duties for so small a number of men appeared to be unjustifiable,(3)   Arrangements for the exchange of incapacitated having broken down a proposal was made by us in January, 1.017, for the mutual exchange of 100 invalid prisoners, this number being subsequently extended to 600 - the accommodation of a -hospital ship,  he only reply received was to the effect that they were prepared to exchange incapacitated combatants.   The acceptance of our proposal was again urged and the futility of sending a ship for.so small a number as 11 was pointed out.     This resulted in nothing,(4)   A proposal was then made for the exchange on the Sinai front of men captured there.   This was refused by the Turkish Commander in May last.(5)   The Turkish Government then suggested that an exchange of incapacitated might be effected at Scalanova as Mersina was said by them to be impracticable and stated that the number of British incapacitated was 22.   Their acceptance of the proposal to exchange 100 or 600 prisoners was pressed on the Turks but this th^yr definitely refused in August,
(6)   A proposal has recently been made that an exchange might he effected by way of Smyrna and Mitylene.   This is under consideration,(7)   Information has just been received from Berne that some 50 of our incapacitated combatants are being repatriated by way of Vienna and Switzerland, but it is not known if this is in fact being done.(8)   As regards the exchange of civilians we have hitherto acted in conjunction with the French.(a)   The Turks originally undertook to repatriate all British and French civilians if Ayoub S^bri and Zennoun, prisoners-of-war in Malta were returned to Turkey.   We accepted this but the Turks backed out.---(b)   We and the French then proposed a mutual exchange of all civilians in our hands for all our&apos; compatriot civilians in Turkey.   This was ac-ce-oted with the proviso that males &apos;.   of military age were to he, excepted but that Ayoub and Zennoun were to be included.After corsultation witfcthe French, in February last, we felt unable to agree to this, ^but consented to the retention by both parties of a limited number for &quot;military reasons&quot;.   No more has been heard of this proposal.(c)   ^attempt to exchange/civilians (especially women andchildren from the $e4.ia2 across the Sinai front met with no auccess.Until quite recently- 1lo amoxint* of pressure has induced the Turkish Government to allow of the inspection of Turkish Camps by members of American or Dutch Legations af Constantinople.   The only inspection of such camps which has taken place was made on restricted and someY/hat perfunctory lines by delegates of the Geneva Red Cross towards the close of 1916., but information was received this week that permission has been accorded to a member of the Dutch Legation at Constantinople to visit prisoner camps for the purpose of inquiring into their requirements for the winter.. The nature of this visit is extremely vague; no camps are specified, and it seems probable that nothing serious is contemplated.(10) The essential fact whicfc. emerges from the negotiations with the Turkish Government is that there is only one prisoner to whom they attach any importance, via. AYOUB SABRI.   The unconditional release of this man has been demanded in overbearing and insolent terms, accompanied by a threat thatj if it is not speedily acceeded to, all British civilians in Turkey will be interned.   His Majesty^ Government have naturally refused to comply with this demand, but have intimated that they are prepared to discuss with Turkish delegates questions concerning prisoners-of-war inoluding the exchange of Ayoub Sabri.   Hitherto the Turkish Government have not formally accepted the proposal of a conference, but we have been informed through the Hague that the proposal has been agreed to &quot;in principle&quot;, which, according to experience, may mean much or nothing at all.1st October, 1917.DERBY.
