Although in some of the more favoured districts in the country the harvest is almost completed, very little &quot;leading&quot; has yet taken place in the majority of the counties.   It is reported, however, that no signs of damage are so far apparent in the grain in stook.   On the other hand crops still uncut are shedding seed to a serious extent.1. District Agricultural Committees.A representative of the Board has visited Selkirkshire and dealt with many questions raised by the looal Committee.2. Grass Parks.The Board have issued copies of the attached circular to Committees regarding the utilisation of grass lands not to be broken up for the 1918 orop and have asked for their views on the proposal put forward in the oircular that the Board should take over suoh areas under Section (l) (a) of the Defence of the Realm Regulation 2 M. for allocation amongst farmers who are in need of extra grazings.3. Compulsory Order under Defence of the Realm Regulation 2 M.The Board have issued an Order under Defence of the Realm Regulation 2 M. intimating their intention to enter on and take possession of part of the Deer Forest of Ben Damph, the property of the Earl of Lovelace, with a view to its being let for grazing purposes.4. Corn Production Act 1917.A oircular has been issued showing the distriots into which Scotland has been divided for the purpose of constituting District Vages Committees under Part II of the Act and indicating the Board1s views as to the method of forming oommittees.   A oopy is attached.(b) Allotments.Supply of Fertilisers.The Board have issued the attached circular recommending allot-went holders to form themselves into definite associations to facilitate them in securing adequate supplies of fertilisers, seeds, plants, etc for the coming season.   The Board have impressed upon them the necessity of placing orders for fertilisers immediately.

It ie expected that in many oounties a considerable proportion of the land whioh is generally let for grass parks will be broken up for the growing of grain in 1918.    The breaking up of such parks will limit the aroa available for grazing, and the extra cultivation which is to be undertaken on many farms may, and probably will, inoreaaethe demand by farmers for extra grass lands.     In these oiroumetanoeB, the Board invite your Committee to consider whether they would recommend that the Board should take possession of all or any of the parks in your district which will not be put into cultivation.    Proprietors of grass lands may agree to put them at the disposal of Committees, but, failing this, there does not appear to be any reason why they should not be taken into possession under the provisions of Section (1) (a) of Defence of the Realm Regulation 2M.     Committees would then be in a position to allocate the parks to those farmers In their district who were in greatest need of extra grass, and the rent a. would be regulated, abnormal increases whioh would otherwise probably oocur being thus obviated,     It is not anticipated that there would be great difficulty in arranging an equitable sum to be paid to owners of grass parks In name of rent, e.g. the average of the rents of seasons 1915, 1916 and 1917 might be agreed upon as a maximum.    Where agreement cannot be effected the case might be submitted to the Board.I am to add that as arrangements for seasonal grazings are sometimes made in the autumn, the Board would be glad if this matter oould receive the early attention of your Committee.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant, H.M. CONACHER,Secretary.The Secretary, District AgriculturalExecutive Committee,
CORN PRODUCTION ACT, 1917.CONSTITUTION OF DISTRICT WAGES COMMITTEES.The Board of Agriculture for Scotland, in pursuance of the powers conferred upon them by the Second Schedule to the Corn Production Act, 1917, have divided Scotland into the following districts for the purpose of certifying representative joint committees (comprising a chairman and representatives of employers of agricultural labour and of workmen employed in agriculture in equal numbers), hereinafter referred to as District Wages Committees, whose principal statutory duty will be to fix minimum rates of wages for work within their respective districts.DISTRICTS into which Scotland has been divided by the Board of Agriculture for Scotland for the purpose op constituting District Committees under the Corn Production Act, 1917.(1) Counties of Shetland, Orkney, Caithness, and Sutherland.(2) County of Ross-shire Districts of Black Isle, Easter Ross, and Mid-Ross, except the Parish of Lochbroom. County of Inverness Districts of Inverness,Aird, Badenoch.County of Nairn. County of Moray. (3) Counties of Banff, Aberdeen, Kincardine. (4) County of Forfar.County of Perth Central District.Perth District. Blairgowrie District.Western District Parishes of Ardoch, Dunblane, and Lecro.pt, Kircardine, Kilmadock, Port of Menteith. (5) Counties of Fife and Kinross. (6) Counties of The Lothians and Peebles. (7) Counties of Berwick, Roxburgh, and Selkirk. (8) Counties of Dumfries, Kirkcudbright, and Wigtown. (9) County of Ayr. (10) Counties of Lanark, Renfrew, Dumbarton, Stirling, Clackmannan. (11) County of Argyll.County of Bute (including Arran). County of Perth -Highland District.Western District Parishes  of Callander, Aberfoyle, Bal-quhidder, Killin. (12) County of Inverness Lochaber and Insular Districts.County of Ross-Mid-Ross (Parish of Lochbroom only), Western, South-Western, Lewis Districts.For the purpose of determining who are workmen employed in agriculture, the Act defines &quot;workmen&quot; as including &quot;boys, women, and girls,&quot; and agriculture as including the use of land as grazing, &quot; meadow, or pasture land, or orchard, or osier land, or wood-land, or for market gardens or nursery grounds,&quot; i.e. in addition to the ordinary meaning of arable cultivation.The Act contemplates the District Wages Committees being formed by local initiative, but empowers the Board to fix a date by which, if no effective District Com-mittee has been so formed, it will be the duty of the Board to form a committee for the district. As the District Wages Committees grouped in combinations of districts have to elect the Central Wages Committee, which committee in turn has to lay down certain rules for the guidance of the District Wages Committees, the Board, desiring to have the whole machinery for fixing minimum wages in working order as soon as possible, have fixed 15th November as the date by which District Committees should be formed.M &amp; G Ltd Wt   /Gr. 9  9-17  1000 G. 2
Where in any of the afore-mentioned districts the Board are satisfied that a representative joint committee, comprising a chairman and representatives of employers of agricultural labour and of workmen employed in agriculture, in equal numbers, exists for purposes which include the fixing of minimum rates of wages for workmen employed in agriculture, the Board will be prepared to recognise and certify such a committee as a District Wages Committee for the district, subject to any modification that may be necessary in the event of the area within which any such committee operates not coinciding exactly with the area of any one of the districts afore-mentioned. Any such existing committee is therefore requested to report to the Board without delay its area, its composition, constitution, and rules of procedure.Where no such committee exists local efforts should be made to form a committee. The Board will be prepared to recognise and certify in terms of the Act as the District Wages Committee for any of the afore-mentioned districts a committee, which may be formed in this way before the prescribed date, similar in character to the committees referred to in the foregoing paragraph.For the purpose of indicating what in their view constitutes a representative joint committee for the purpose of the Act, and with a view to facilitate the formation of such committees, the Board make the following recommendations : (1) That such committee shall consist of 5 representatives of employers of labour and 5 representatives of workmen and a chairman appointed by the 10 other members,(2) that the Employers&apos; Representatives shall be selected by local or generalorganisations of employers of agricultural labour approved by the Board, (3) that the Workmen&apos;s Representatives shall be selected by any association ofworkmen employed in agriculture approved by the Board, (4) that the committees comprise as far as possible representatives of each kind ofworkmen (including women workers) employed in the district, and correspond-ingly of employers of labour occupying the various types of agriculturalholding found in the district, (5) that every effort should be made to ensure that the representatives of bothparties represent an actual majority of employers and workmen in thedistrict respectively.The Board reserve to themselves the right, in cases where the representative character of the committee in this sense is not fully established to their satisfaction by the committee at the time of applying for certification, to recognise and certify such committee subject to the addition of such further members as the Board may think fit to nominate.When in any district the two groups of constituent bodies have selected the respective representatives of employers and workmen, each group should instruct one of their officers to intimate to the other group the collection of members of the District Wages Committee, and to arrange for the first meeting of the District Wages Committee, at which a chairman should be appointed. The intimation of the formation of the com-mittee with a statement of the grounds on which the application for recognition and certification is based should be made to the Board. For the purposes of facilitating pro-ceedings under this paragraph, associations of employers, or workmen proposing to take action in any district with a view to selecting workmen&apos;s representatives for a District Wages Committee, are invited to notify their intention to the Board.The Act contemplates the payment of the expenses incurred with the consent of the Board by any members of District Wages Committees in the performance of their duties, and of any sums paid (also with the consent of the Board) to any such members by way of compensation for loss of time, in each case up to an amount approved by the Treasury. No such amounts having yet been approved, the Board are not in a position to say more than that they are prepared generally to consent to payments of this nature, especially in view of the somewhat large areas of some of the districts and the consequent expense of travelling.The Board are authorised by regulation to prescribe the tenure of office and procedure of a certified District Wages Committee. This they will do in due course, but in the meantime they think it sufficient to state that in their view three years would be a suitable term of office for a District Wages Committee.H. M. CONACHER, Secretary.Board op Agriculture for Scotland, 2,2nd September 1917.
BOARD OP AGRICULTURE FOR SCOTLAND.FOOD PRODUCTION.SUPPLY OF FERTILISERS FOR ALLOTMENTS.The Board of Agriculture for Scotland desire to bring to the notice of allotment holders the fact that, owing to the efforts at present being made in this country to extend the area of land under cultivation,1 and to increase the yield from such land, the demand for fertilisers during next season is not only certain to be very much greater than usual, but may very probably exceed the supply available.This demand will be still further increased by the needs of holders of allotments throughout the country, and, in order that their requirements may not be overlooked, the Board would impress upon them the necessity for forming themselves into definite organisations or associations, and appointing a small committee or a corresponding member in each such association to act on behalf of the members generally.Amongst the advantages to be obtained from the formation of such associations, the Board would emphasise the following, viz.: (1) By combination of their orders for supplies of fertilisers, seeds, plants, etc., the members of the association will be in a better position to secure supplies and to get them at cheaper rates, than if they placed their orders indi-vidually. By this means also it will be possible to avoid the extra labour involved in the handling of very small quantities of fertilisers, seeds, plants, etc., thereby relieving congestion at the works and on rail, facilitat-ing distribution, and saving labour..M &amp; G Ltd Wt 3432/103 9-17  5000 G. 2
(2) Through the medium of such associations the Board will be enabled to ascertain the likely or actual requirements of allotment holders, convey information regarding prices and supplies, and take what steps may appear necessary to promote an equitable allocation of the supplies available.The prices of certain fertilisers are already fixed for the coming season, and in some cases orders for almost the whole output for the coming season have been booked. Farmers are being urged to place all their orders at the earliest possible date with the makers or merchants with whom they usually deal, and so obtain any supplies that are available at a price which, in the case of most fertilisers, rises according to the date at which delivery is taken. Early delivery in these cases means a lower price.It is essential, therefore, that allotment holders should take immediate steps to safeguard their interests by forming themselves into associations as suggested, and instructing their committee or corresponding member to ascertain the total requirements of the members as regards fertilisers, seeds, etc., and place orders for these quantities to the best advantage with local merchants, malting such arrangements as regards method and time of delivery as will suit local conditions. In some districts it may be found possible to make up combined orders from several associations, and, if these are suffi-ciently large, deal direct with manufacturers.The Board would be glad to be furnished at the earliest possible date with the name of each Allotment Association formed, whether for the purpose of combining orders or otherwise, the name and address of each corresponding member, and some indication as to the area in which the allotments are situated.Copies of (1) circulars showing particulars of the arrangements so far made as regards the prices and supply of fertilisers, and (2) of a leaflet on the subject of &quot; The Manuring of Cottage Gardens and Allotments,&quot; may be obtained on application to the Board.Board of Agriculture for Scotland, 29 St. Andrew Square, Edinburgh.18th September 1917.
