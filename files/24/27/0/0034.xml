Colonel Jonesh?ETi wmmm is the property op his britannic majbsty*s government./Printed for the War Cabinet.     September 1917.L i J -iSECRET-- - / 14RECRUITMENT   OF   LABOUR   PROM   SHIPYARDS.Memorandum by the Minister of Munitions.I DESIRE to support the recommendations made by the Minister of National Service in a memorandum of the 15th September,G.T.2042, on the question of the issue of certificates to men of military-age who entered shipyards between the 29th March and the 15th July of this year.     I agree With his arguments and with his conclusions, but I wish to add one further consideration.The proposal of the Admiralty is, as they state, to treat the decision of the Cabinet to protect from recruitment men who entered shipyards between the 29th March and the 15th July as if it were a revision of the Schedule of Protected Occupations, since Scheduled Occupation certificates can only be issued to men who are covered by the express terms of the Schedule,      The representatives of the Government who made the Agreement Of the 4th and 5th May with the A.ScE., which wac subsequently extended to other Unions, undertook however not to revise the Schedule without consultation with the Unions concerned.      It has been found necessary in one or two minor instances to provide, since the Schedule oame into operation, for the protection from recruitment of classes of men not covered by the Schedule, although engaged on Admiralty, War Office, or Munition work; but these extensions have never been treated as involving revision of the Schedule, and the men affected have received the B. protection certificate (Army Porm 17.3476 B) and not the Scheduled Occupation certificate.     The time, is approaching when the whole question of the revision of the Schedule will have to be taken up with the Trade Unions in fulfilment of the Governments undertaking of the 4th and 5th May.      It will embarrass those responsible for
the current administration of the Schedule, ahd for the negotia-tions whibh will then have to be conducted with the Trade Unions, if piecemeal revisions are made in the meantime.The B. certificates which have been or are being issued to the unskilled men who have entered shipyards between the  9th March and the 15th July ensure them, as Sir Auckland Geddes points out, ouite adequate protection while they are engaged in shipyards.   I see no sufficient reason for withdrawing these certificates and re-placing them by others, in face of the objections to this procedure pointed out by Sir Auckland Geddes and in this memorandum.(SGD.) vOTSTON S. CHURCHILL.September 27, 1917.
