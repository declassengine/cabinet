Weekly EctulW of Shipplm  cssesT//       1 9 Q 160n 1 f teirklty ?&apos;emorandum to the War Oabinot,The? weekly figures as to shipping losses have hithcrtc boon restricted to statements cf the number of British ships svnk* vessels of 1,600 tens and over boinft distinguished frow those under 1.600 tons.   Against this, fibres purporting to be the arrivals at and sailings from U,K, ports have boon ;?:ivcn.The Prime Minister1s speech in tho Horse of Commons on the 16th August, in which he announced the tonnage losses^ has brought about a change in the situation; and in view of the criticisms tc which the Rotum is frequently subjected * the present would appear to bo an opportune time at which to review the form in which the information shall be published in future.The fibres of arrivals and sailings, as now published, are misleading in seme respects; and it is felt that tho Cabinet do net fully reaii&amp;e that this is tho case. For instance, these fibres include foreign/vessels, whereas /owno^/ the lossos reported exclude roroi^n sinkings.   Further, the whole of the coasting services are included, each intermediate port of call beinn; counted t*wice as an entry and a sailing; and * in addition to this anomaly thoro arc other cases cf duplication.   To cite an example, it nay be pointed out that tho whole cf the Scandinavian and White Sea trade assemble at Lerwick, and are counted as entries to and clearances from Lerwiok, and also entries to and sailings from their terminal ports,   Similarly, vessels arriving from overseas at Falmcuth or othor ports of call arc included as arrivals and clearances at that port as well as at the ultimate port of destination.It is considered most desirable that the Return issued in future should be less open to criticism than tho one now issued by the Admiralty under the instructions of the Cabinet, -The attached comparison of figures issued by the German newspaper &quot;Dicpost&quot; for Aupvst 11th - 14th with the actual figures shows the lines up&amp;n which the enemy1 s news-papers deal with the Position.It is su Treated, for the consideration of the war Cabinet, that the -*nfcreation tc bo civen to the public in future should be irivon on tho following linos (1)  A weekly statement of -(a) The number cf British ships sunk;(b) The number of British ships unsuccessfullyattacked.(2)  A monthly statement issued on the 1st of every month cf the tenna/re of British ships sunk, the statement tc bo published one month in arrcar,It is proposed that tho first monthly Return, vis., the one to be published on the 1st October, should *tive the monthly tormarte from January last to August, inclusive,(Signed)fteddes,85.Q.17.
