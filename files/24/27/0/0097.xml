THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 0$ HIS BRITTAflC MA-JBSTY^S GOVERNMENT.SOCKET G.T.2194A.WA.R CABipT.LABOUR DISBUTSS.Statement of Policy by the Rt. Hon. Viscount Milner GOB.,,The question of the machinery to he employed in trying to settle Labour Disputes, especially demands for increased wages, in cases where the Government itself is nominally or virtually the employer, is becoming one of urgent importanceThe demand for increased wages, stimulated by the concessions already made to the miners, and worked up, to some extent at any rate, by people whose real objeot is to cause trouble and impede- the conduct of the war, is perhaps the most serious difficulty now confronting us.It was hoped, that the heavy new burden, which the State has now taken upon itself, in order to keep down the oost of the necessaries of life, and the steps taken to stop profiteering, could be used as an effective argument against further increases of wages.     But this hope has so far proved delusive.If the pressure exercised upon the Government by powerful Unions is to be resisted, or in any degree controlled, it is necessary that there should be one authority dealing with all general demands for increases of wages, otherwise a concession made in one case is apt fatally to compromise the position in other cases.The Cabinet Committee appointed by War Cabinet Minute 191 (5) (as amended by Minute 208 (11) ), has had several interviews with the President of the Board of Trade and the Coal Controller, accompanied by Sir R. Redmayne,on the one hand, the Minister of Labour and the Chief Industrial Commis-sione%*,or his representative on the other.     The conclusion they have come to is that, on principle, there is no justification for dealing with Wages questions affecting miners by a different machinery from that provided for dealing with disputes about wages in other industries.   It is contended, on behalf of the Coal Controller, that he is in an impartial position as between mine-owners and miners and therefore the proper person to arbitrate or initiate arbitra- , tion on differences between them.    As a matter-of-fact this is not the real position.   The mine-owners, now that they have a oertain profit guaranteed to them, are comparatively Indif-ferent about a rise in wages.     They put up no fight, indeed there is always a danger, when the State has to foot the whole bill, that employers may play into the hands of workmen over demands for higher wages.    As these do not come out of their pookets, they may think it politic to win favour with the men by supporting or at least not opposing suoh demands.In the case of the Mines, as in that of the Railways, the real Employer, under present circumstances,is the State. In actual fact therefore it is the Coal Controller, repreeent-ing the State, on the one hand, and the miners on the other,and the Rt. Hon. g. N. Barnes M.P.who/
who are the parties to the controversy, and if the necessity for mediation between them arises, some third party ought to be found to undertake it. The natural third party ought to be found to undertake it. The natural third party is the Industrial Commissioner (formerly attached to the Board of Trade, now to the Ministry of Labour), with the existing machinery for arbiration, whether by the Committee of Production or specially appointed arbitrators, behind him.

We do not of course wish to suggest that every dispute arising in the Mining Industry should at once be taken to the Industrial Commissioner. In ordinary cases no doubt the Coal Controller, with the aid of his Advisory Board, should be able to find a way out within the industry. But failing such agreement there seems to be no good reason why the matter should not be referred to the Industrial Commissioner and dealt with on the same lines as other disputes, which employers and employed cannot settle between themselves. The argument for uniformity of procedure seems all the stronger under present circumstances when so many different classes of workmen are agitating for increases on the ground of the increased cost of living. Unless there is some measure of uniformity, and some general principle is followed in dealing with these demands, different industries may receive in any one case will certainly be used as a lever for obtaining similar increases all round.

The broad proposition that there should be only one ultimate authority in all labour disputes seems to us incontestable. But the Coal Controller reports that in the Mining industry there is the strongest opposition, on the part of both masters and men, to any interference by the Ministry of Labour. The Coal Controllers Advisory Board, which consists of a number of very representative man of both classes, is very emphatically against such interference. They seem to desire that the Mining industry, by virtue of its great strength and peculiar character should occupy a privileged position in this respect and be virtually left to itself. We are of opinion that it would be dangerous to admit this principle, and that, if admitted in the case of the miners, it would be difficult to refuse similar special treatment to other large and highly organised bodies of workers - for instance, the railway-men. The demand of the minersis of such importance and may have such far reaching consequences that we think we ought to refer the question to the Cabinet for final decision.
