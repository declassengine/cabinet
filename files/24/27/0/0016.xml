%4aWeekly Report on Italy, XIDepartment of Information Intelligence Bureau, FHf/01224th Sept,External relations. Italy and Serbia.Nothing has been officially announced regarding the resulte of recent conversations between M. Pa^ie and the Italian Government, but it is generally assumed in the press that little or no pro-gress was made towards an accord.     II. Pasic&quot; left Rome for Corfu on Sept, 12th.Signor Bevione, whose communications derive a certain importance from his connection ;,ith the Giornale dfItalia   ( for which journal he acted as Special Correspondent during Barun Sonnino&apos;s visits to Paris and London) and the fact that he was the channel through which the results of the St. Jean de Maurienne Conference reached the Italian press, publishes ? further letter in the Gazzetta del Popolo (Turin) of Sept.. 7th.     The position he takes up is that while a cordial understanding or, better, s permanent alliance between Italy and Jugo-Slavia is a necessity in view of the luke-v/armness of $the Western powers in regard to the dismemberment of Austria amd their apparent blindness to their own vital interest in that policy, Italy&apos;s territorial rights on the Adriatic are no longer in question having been once and for all and with minute precision guaranteed by^the fdrmal treaty concluded in April 1915 between the Great Powers of the Entente.     These rights Sonnino has &quot;energetically confirmed&quot; during the visits to Paris and London &quot;beyond all chance of ambiguity&quot; in presence of the Allies, making it clear that those rights are no linger called in auesti^n by anyAnother point on which Bevione lays stress is Italy&apos;s right to veto the unification of the various Jugo-Slav populations. &quot;According to the treaty&quot; he writes, &quot;our Government has indisputablysf them.
Italy, the other party interested in the Treaty, h?s full, absolute and irrevocable right to invoke its application&quot;.     To the question whether Italy ought to take advantage of this&quot;clause&quot; in the treaty and exercise her right of veto Bevinne answers decidedly &quot;Ho&quot; (1) for ideal reasons - Nationalist and Liberal Italy cannot identify herself with a lletternichean &apos;divide et impera&apos; policy.     She would stultify all her professions.    (2) for the practical reason that her central interest lies in strengthening the internal enemies of Austria To oppose this union is to pl&amp;y the Austrian game.      ^As regards Lalmatia - &quot;Lord Robert Ceoil pointed^to Pasic that the way to a united Jugo-Slavia lay through Rome:   Rome can only point out to Basic1 the road of Sara and Se^enico&quot;.     Renunciation is im-possible for Italy.     &quot;Italy would rise as one man against any Government which proposed it&quot;.     Moreover Italy has already made con-cessions,     vthen      Suped-i was in Petrograd with M. Sazonov he was in-formed that Italy&apos;s claims in Dalmatia extended to Warenta. The Army.The Minister of Vfer, Genor;;l Giardino, in an. interview with ReuterTs representative, gives an account of the military effort of Italy,     She has, he says, more than doubled her army-corps, vastly increased and created new types of artillery, quadrupled the engineer sappers and created and improved all kinds of technical services -e.g. 800 photo-electric sections have been constituted.The Italian army as a whole has been trebled since the beginning of the war.     Twenty-six classes - over 4,200,000 men have been mobilised who have been almost entirely employed as fighting units, to keep up the numreis required and replace &quot;bosses.has renounced in the F&amp;lkan SSlavs;    but*,&apos;this   veto once   stipulatedthe right to invoke the veto&quot; which was specially claimed by Czarist Russia.     Czarist Russia has disappeared and Revolutionary Russia
internal Affairs.The Cabinet crisis which seemed imminent as a result of Signor Orlando *s offered or threatened - his attitude is not yet clear -resignation has been averted for the present.The questions o&amp; Commisariat reform and of Signor Orlando1 s position in view of the insistent demand for a more vigorous internal policy ocoupied the Cabinet at its meeting of Sept. 12th at which the Minister of the Interior was sufficiently recovered to be present.     The Cabinet was divided on the subject and the discussion had to be re-newed next day (13th)   The Official Communique stated that the Cabinet after two meetings devoted to the discussion of &quot;general policy&apos; had 1 concluded by agreeing unanimously on thise lines which are adapted to the present conditions prevailing in the country&apos;     It is said that Baron Sonnlno was among the Ministers who supported the demand for severer handling of neutralism.     With him were the Ministers of the Left - Bissolati, Comondini and Bonomi   and apparently others also. Press aoor. unts of what took plo.ee (permitted by the Censor on thisoccasion contrary to the rule which has been in force for some time past4orRepresent Signor Orlando as having been with difficulty prevailed upon by his colleagues to remain in the Ministry.     It was felt that,since the Ministry was obviously involved as a whole in responsibility for the policy hitherto pursued by the ministry of the Interior, the resigna-tion of Signor Orlando would necessitate the resignation of the whole Ministry  - a result whioh would be not only contrary to Boselli&apos;s pledges against an extra-parliamentary crisis but would be most un-desirable in the public interest.     At the same time in view of the very strong public demand for a change in the methods and personnel of theHome Office   sometljhg more than   a miece promise was required of the Ministry, and as a compromise it was later announced that the resigna-tions ef the Chief of Police (Comm Vigliani) and of the Chief of the
the two officials named have been the targets for the bitterest attacks cf the interventionist press as being      too friendly terms with leoders of the Socialist party.     eurratftnl is- moreover regarded with suspicion cs being efte-crr the many survivors of the Giolittian regime whe rha^fcund shelter in the Palazzo Brasohi.The declaration of war on subversive Socialism seems to have followed with little delay.   Telegrams to the British press of the 18th state that the Italian Government has ordered proceedings to be taken against the Secretary (Lazzari) of the Official Socialist party as responsible for the issue of a circular addressed to the Mayors (Sindeci) of the Socialist Communes advocating immediate peace and urging Municipal Councils to resign so as to embarras national resis-tance.     It is further semi-officially announced (press telegrams 19. 9. 17.) that in consequence of demands of the military authorities the 3 provinces of Allesandria, Genoa and Turin were decreed as falling within the war-zone.     Thus the Government which has hitherto osten-sibly ignored and by means of the Censorship endeavoured to keep the public in agnorance of the subversive work carried on by the Socialist organisation (On Sept. 8th e.g. an account given in the Popolo d I Italia of the very circular in question was suppressed by the Censor) has now committed itself to a struggle in the open.     The decision may have been inevitable , but its results are likely to be very serious.     Socialism is a strong force in Italy and it will have secret encouragement from the other neutralist groups.     The forces of neutralism will thus be consolidated and perhaps driven into combined action in Parliament or in the country or in both.The interventionist press refuses to accept the Cabinet&apos;3 solution of the crisis as satisfactory.     Either, it is urged, the Minister of the Interior was the responsible author of the weak policy hitherto pursued and inspired his subordinates, or he was in their hands.     Inf the Ministry of the Interior (Comm. Corradini) had been acceded.
In either case his unfitness for so important a position is proved. The Ministry may have made up its quarrel with Orlando:   the country has not.The successes gained in the recent offensive on the Isonzo, of which naturally the most is made in the interventionist ^ress, feats done much to strengthen the resisting power of the Country, which had been badly shaken by anxiety as to the supply of coal and grain.     The moral of the army is said to be excellent.The recent disturbances at Turin and other piaces are ascribed to a rariety of causes - (1) to a real shortage of grain due to general causes (2) to bad organisation and want of forethought on the part of th Commissariat Department. (3) to deliberate sabotage on the part of Socialist organisations, supported perhaps by German agents.     Hcoli-gans arrested in the riots were found to be irioossession of conspicuous suras of money varying from 150 to 300 lire (Sir R. Rodd Sept 9th)The Goverament appear now to be really convinced of the necessity both for drastic action agaihst the insidious activities of the Social-ists and their allies and for immediate reforms in the Food Department, especially as regards local control and distribution.     Sir Rennel Rodd reports thatfthere seems little prospect of any general organised movenaent in favour of premature peace throughout the Country as a whole1 and adds that &quot;the only serious grounds for oreoccupation as to the resisting -oower of Italy lie in the failure of the coal-supply and the danger of grain-imports falling short of the- indispensable needs of the country. &apos;J.C.P.
