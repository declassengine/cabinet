RAw MATERIALS..&apos;(Translation of Note given by M.Clementel to / Sir Albert Stanley, President of the Board of Trade).t*   ***********   t**:       ,,: &apos; . &apos;       - \ ^      .&apos;.TJitb the exception of the. Argentine Republicall the great producing countries are ranged to-day on the aide of the Allies.By coming to an understanding between themselves therefore the Allies oan make themselves masters of the principal economic markets.     They will thus be able to ensure to themselves the control and disposal of most of the products required both for food and for military and civil industries.Such an understanding between the Allies is of paramount interest, and as much so during the war as on the re-eetablish-ment of. peace.During the war it will enable the blockade of the enemy to be tightened and at the same time facilitate the provisioning of the Allies.By pooling the. production of this or&apos;that produot the Alliea will oaoure an absolute oontrol of the market.     This, will enable them to provide, under the most favourable - conditions, for the needs of their own-consumption, to settle, in the manner most favourable to themselves questions of freight, exchange, &amp;e.,The neutrals, finding themselves no-longer able to Ohtain their requirements in the open market, will, be obliged to approach the sole possessors of the commodities and products which they require, namely the Allies.    The latter will -not refuse them assistance, but will impose conditions;     They will say to the neutrals:   &quot;Vte are quite willing to cede to you the quantities whioh you need, but put at our disposal a part of your-tannage and undertake to discontinue all your exports to Germany or to limit them in a manner to oe agreed upon&quot;The Allies will likewise say to the neutrals.   &quot;We agree to provision you, but at a time when the- whole world suffers from shortage of crops and of raw.materials, it would be inadmiss-ible that you, who have not. had to suffer by the. war, should continue to live in abundance.    He shall, therefore, be obliged to ration you in the same may^ as we are ourselves&quot;The Allies will secure by these -measures an appreciable %&apos; economy of tonnage at the name time as an .increased supply of the commodities and products available for their needs.   Above all they will tighten in the most effective manner the blockade of Germany.
This organisation will be for the Allies a powerful weapon with a view to securing the re-establishment of peace by forcing the Central Empires to accept, the conditions of the Entente .   The Chancellor of the German Empire appeals on all occasions to the German war map .   io be in absolute possession and control of the essential raw materials, as will .be the case if the desired understanding Is arrived at, will be to have in one^s hands a war map formidable in another manner *   No means of exchange will be any longer available .   The enemy, who has exhausted all his stocks, cannot live, Germany above all, without industry and (which follows) without raw materials .Once such an accord, is. realised , the Allies must announce it publicly;to Germany, saying to her, &quot;We are resolved to remain on the defensive until you accept our conditions., and if you refuse then Y/e are agreed to refuse you raw materials for period equal to that of the war. If you accept, our conditions , as soon as you liberate the territories which do not belong to you, which you occupied by force at a time when the Allies , trusting in peace, had made no preparations for war, we will at the same time release the raw materials, reserving to ourselves a prior claim on those necessary to the reconstitution of our industries and the resumption of our economic activity.11Even a people afflicted like Germany with militarist magalomania cannot resist for long such a menace resolutely presented .The scheme for the concentration by the Allies of all their means in essential raw materials can succeed only if Prance and the United States are fully in agreement with Great Britain.   It will be necessary, in order to secure the conviction and decision of the United States, first to establish firmly between Prance and Great Britain the agreement on raw materials foreshadowed by the economic conference of June 1916 , regarded no more as a means of exerting pressure on the enemy but as a means of mutual aid In order to provide for industrial reconstruction. It will be necessary, in pursuance of the policy inaugurated by the creation of the Wheat Executive and continued at this moment by the proposal for the establishment of a Seed Executive, to unite the two countries by associations working for-the joint purchase, control and distribution of certain essential materials, with a view to the suppression, to the utmost possible extent.,, of the discrepancy existing to-day between the nei, prises of-these raw materials and their arrival in.the two countries.If the Government of the United States lends its support, the. Allies,&apos; profiting by the Franco-British experience of-Executives, must set up at once a central organism both investigatory and executive .   Its first care must be to enlarge the scope of the Executives already existing, to set up new organisations for such materials as it is considered should be included in the agreement -adopting not a rigid system but the most simple and practical methods which will enable the Allies to effect control, taking into account existing organisations and the general situation of each branch of commerce or industry.The Inter-Allied-organisation, with the exception of some of them which operate , as the Wheat Executive at
the present time, with funds provided by the contracting States, will operate with furids placed at their disposal by the syndicates interested.. To what, commodities should the understanding apply? Solely of course to those lacking to Germany.    It would be puerile to seek to pbol Iron, Goal or Potash, which Germany possesses;, in abundance...    This class of commodity is however very limited * and it, may be^ said that the greater number of alimentary products and of raw materials necessary for industry are capable of&quot;being controlled by the Allies.   a perusal of the attached statements? showing the production of all.the important raw materials classified according to their origin, will demon-strate that the Allies can take, under their control the greater part of the production of the whole world.It should he repeated that such a control would be, in the hands of the Allies, a formidable weapon during the war and a powerful means of decision in favour of the humane peace, based on the law of nations, which is their common aim.$    Not reproduced.23rd August, 1917.
