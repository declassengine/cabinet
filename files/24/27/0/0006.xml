lord rhondda received a deputation from the meat trades federation at grosvenor house on september 17, at which various points dealing with the recent meat prices order were brought up for consideration. the butchers urged that in some cases farmers were charging too much for cattle, and strongly advocated a system of purchase by live weight at fixed prices. they also recommended that cattle should be graded.lord rhondda said that the remedy for high prices was to a large extent in the hands of the butchers. higher prices were charged owing to competition among themselves. the maximum prices for meat would he strictly enforced and there was little reason to doubt that.the prices for cattle would soon adjust themselves.Milk. a memorandum for the guidance of food control committees is being-prepared and will be issued at once.an order limiting the amount of milk that may be purchased by factories for conversion into condensed, dried, or other milk substitutes will be issued immediately.Oils and Fats. the work of establishing a scheme for rationing feeding-stuffs to farmers is being continued. the compound cake manufacturers have been asked to submit their views on the joint scheme drawn up by the seed crushers committee and the cattle food dealers; negotiations on the same lines are in progress with the cattle food importers.negotiations for the purchase of west african palm kernels and ground nuts . are continued, and it is hoped that a definite announcement may soon be made.Potatoes. the Potatoes Order, 1917, dated september 13, 1917, gives effect to the government guarantee to the grower in respect of potatoes sold by him on. or after the 15th september, by prescribing a growers&apos; minimum price of Ql. per ton f.o.r. to come into force as from that date. it provides also for control of the potato trade at all stages, by prescribing, as from the 1st october, a growers&apos; maximum price of 6l 10s. f.o.r., by limiting the profits of wholesalers and by fixing a scale of maximum retail prices, the effect of which is that potatoes purchased by a retailer at prices between 6s. and 7s. 6d. per cwt. may be retailed at not more than Id. per lb., and those purchased at prices above 7s. Qd. per cwt. may be retailed at not more than l-4-dl per lb. the maximum retail prices are defined more closely in relation to the retailer&apos;s buying price in the case of sales in quantities of 7 lbs: and upwards.all dealers in potatoes, whether by wholesale or by retail, will require to be registered, and no potatoes may pass through the hands of more than two wholesale dealers between the grower and the retailer. the profits of wholesale dealers are limited to 7s. Qd. per ton on the aggregate of sales averaged over each week or in respect of.sales on commission.with a view to conserving potatoes of good keeping quality until the later months of the season, the sale of potatoes of certain varieties is prohibited, except under the food controllers licence. the grower&apos;s maximum price will hold good until further notice, but will be adjusted, if necessary, later in the season to compen-sate for the wastage and expense involved in keeping back potatoes of such quality. a further order will be issued shortly relating to seed potatoes.Sugar. during the past week the commission has again been immune from loss through submarine.the commission has nominated as its representative on the proposed committee of five, for purchasing and distributing all american and cuban sugar, sir joseph white-todd, a member of the commission, and mr. john drake, senior partner in the firm of messrs. j. v. drake and company, sugar brokers, of mincing lane ; and the food administration in washington has been informed accordingly. these gentlemen will sail for the united states about the middle of october.an offer has been made to amsterdam, on behalf of the sugar commission, through the london exchange committee, to purchase 150,000 tons of java sugar at a price named. mr. hoover has informed us that the united states will not be a competing buyer in the java market, and canada has agreed to stand out of the cuban market, 1under arrangements made with the board of agriculture, some 2,500 tons of sugar have been issued specially, as an additional supply for preservation of hard fruits, and are being distributed through the agency of the food production depart-ment.   an issue of 400 tons for the same purpose in ireland has been authorised.
j     Tea.-The quantity of tea offered for sale by auction this week was unprecedentedlyProgress has been made with the scheme for the purchase of all tea imported from India and Ceylon to theXTnited Kingdom.The returns received under the Tea.(Returns) Order are being tabulated, but final figures are not yet available.enforcement of orders. &apos;. j- .......Local Authorities&apos; Powers.-Lord Rhondda received the Divisional Food Commis-sioners at Grosvenor House on September 19, and the question was raised whether the Order of the 8th May authorising local authorities in England and Wales and their duly appointed officers to prosecute for breaches of the Food Controllers Orders required any, and, if any, what amendment. The matter was left over in order that the Ministry might, confer with, the -Home Office and Local Government Board so as to ascertain how the assistance required by the Local Food Committees for purposes of enforcement could best/be procured from the local authorities on the one hand, and the police on the other. &apos;   ; ; y &apos;   ;  :      &apos; : :: Meat (Sales) Order, 1917. On a reference by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries as to the relative position of the county and the borough police in regard to prosecutions under this Order, the attention of the Board, has been invited to the provisions of Regulation 58 of the Defence of the Realm Regulations, which enable an offence to be tried either at the place in which it was actually committed or at any place in which the offender may be.Sugar Orders. Notwithstanding the restrictions imposed on dealings in sugar abroad, considerable transactions relating to the purchase of sugar in America appear to have been either contemplated or. effected, and careful inquiry is being made into each reported case.The widespread abuse of the facilities granted for the preserving of home-grown fruit has made it necessary for the Ministry to indicate the limits within which prosecutions should be instituted. The offence is generally the absence of any fruit grown by the person who obtained the sugar, and instructions have been given to prosecute in ail cases where half-a-cwt. or more of sugar has been obtained by persons who have no fruit of their own.A conviction was obtained at Reading on the 15th instant against the Secretary and Treasurer of the BasiidonfHorne for Disabled Soldiers.. .These officers appeared to have obtained some four tons of preserving sugar and to have diverted it to other, uses.   Each defendant was fined 201.Bread Order, There have been numerous convictions for selling and exposing for sale bread not made at least 12 hours. In one case at the Thames Police Court on the 15th instant, Max Broer, baker of Mile End, was fined 401. Another baker at: Andover was fined 10/.. for a similar offence, ;PART I!.- SUMMARY OP FOOD POSITION. .Now that the harvest has been, estimated and reckoned in stock the present Food Position in the country may be looked, at as compared with that in the past year.Ta make this, comparison with the past effective the position of the stocks of some of the principal food-stuffs on September 1st 1916, January 1st 1917, May 1st 1917, and September 1st 1917, is displayed in tabular form. It should be noted that on May 1st the country was emerging from, the difficulties of a long and severe winter, these further being accentuated by a scarcity amounting to a dearth in potatoes.stocks.	1916.	1917.

T4Account,.however, has -to: be taken of the live stock in the country. This may be summarised as follows :-Great Britain.and Ireland. ;       &quot;... :Live Stock.	June 4, 1916. .,_l_,-,-	June i, 1917. &quot;	August A, 1917.Cattle -     , -   . - -      ------      - : Pigs    -      -      -      -     . -      -	- : 1   ;          *;...-.-12,112,(300    . 28,806,700   &apos; 3,604,600 -	,12,337,650 v5 &apos; 27,769,760 -     - 3,001,210	12:184,000 25,618,000   -3,052,000According to these figures the number of cattle from June 4th to June 4th has altered but little,, that of sheep has fallen 3^ per cent,-while in the case of pigs there has been a really heavy decline. r- v.If these numbers be considered.in conjunction with those given in the table of stocks it will be seen that despite the severity of the winter, the dearth of potatoes and the ravages and uncertainties occasioned by the. submarine campaign, the position on the whole is more favourable at the beginning of the new cereal year 1917-18 than it was at the beginning &quot;of that which has elapsed.. Health has not suffered and stocks, speaking generally, have increased. There has, however, been a drop in the case of bacon and ham, both in storage, and as represented by pigs, the decline in the live-stock being largely due to a&apos;want of feeding-stuffs..On turning to the position of the country during&apos; the ensuing winter, there are certain novel factors which cannot be ignored. Wastage in tonnage has occurred and losses still continue, the accessible-world harvest is poor and the&quot; home supplies of our Allies are short. As a - consequence we cannot anticipate imports, in the cereals at any rate, on such a plentiful scale as that experienced in both 1916. and the first eight months of 1917. Stocks and home supplies then are matters of the first &quot;import? anee. Assuming that the latter can be reckoned at something like the normal rate, the improvement in stocks must be balanced, against the possible curtailment of imports.-   \i&quot;i&quot; imports. .        :    &apos;--..   . -Aggregate imports of the principal foods amounted to. 184,000 tons in the week ended September 15th (Table&apos;A)&apos;; this is an increase of.7,000 tons over the previous week and is 33.400 tons more than the aggregate in the week ended September 1st, but it is still 42,000 tons below the average&apos;of the year so far.As compared with the previous week there is an increase of 22,31)0 tons in wheat and flour and of 1,100 tons hi oats. , ..;Only 4,400 tons of barley were received last week, about one-fifth of the amount in the corresponding week last year,;.the total for.the year, so. far is 281,000 tons as compared with 617,000 tons in 37 weeks of 1916. Of oats, on the other hand, the relatively large importation of 28,100 tons last week? leaves the total for 1917&apos;only 9 per cent, below that: for the. corresponding period \of last year. The quantity of maize, 12.860 tons, is small,, but. the total for 1917 is still 31 per cent, above that of 37 weeks in 1916.33,000 tons of sugar last week helps to bring up the average of the year, which is now 15 per cent, below that of last. year.Very little meat-beef,, mutton, bacon or hams-arrived last Aveek. The position of bacon and ham was described in last week&apos;s report; it is definitely worse this week as only 2,000 tons arrived, while the average for the year so far is 8,300 tons.consumption.The supply of meat at the Central Market, London, and at Liverpool, Manchester, and Glasgow Markets (Table B) was in the week ended September 8th 15 per cent, below that of the previous week and 19 per cent, below that of theicorresponding week last year. The falling off was; mainly in foreign meat; home-fed meat was only 5 per cent, below last year.In the week ending September 15th 2,910 tons of home-fed meat entered the Central Market, an increase of 17 per cent, over the previous week.
s The index numbers for home-fed meat are obtained from the statistics in Table C, on the basis that the weights of the carcases of fat cattle, sheep, and pigs are respectively 6 cwt., 67 lbs, and 160 lbs. Ireland, unfortunately, is not represented among the 51 markets. The basis of the foreign meat index numbers is taken from the foreign meat supplies in the four meat markets, and this index number is fairly well substantiated by the import statistics. In the last column home-fed meat and foreign meat are combined.The supply of fat cattle at 51 markets in Great Britain. (Table C) was in the week ending September 12th 17 per cent, above that in the previous week and 7 per cent, above the supply in the corresponding week last year. Of fat sheep the number was 7 per cent, above the previous week and 9 per cent, below last year.The number of pigs shows a further slight falling-off and is 41 per cent, below last year.A new table (Table D) is given this week showing the percentage variations in the consumption of bread and meat in 1916 and 1917. The former has been pre-viously described. As to the latter it will be seen that home-fed meat and foreign meat are treated both separately and in combination.&apos;1&apos;&apos;The general conclusion is that the whole consumption of meat at home was in the three months, March, ApriJ, and May, 9 per cent., and in the three months, June, July, and August, 10 per cent, less than last year, and that the great part of the reduction is in the consumption of foreign meat. This result should be compared with that showrn for bread.wholesale paiges.The wholesale price of English beef had fallen another shilling in the week ended September 12th (Table E), and was ,115s, Qd. per cwt., as compared with 120s. a month ago. English mutton has again fallen, and Argentine mutton again risen, till the former is at 119s., and the latter at 107s. 6d.As compared with a month ago, the price of linseed cake has fallen 9 per cent., cotton-seed cake 8 per cent., and palm-kernel cake 13 per cent.
