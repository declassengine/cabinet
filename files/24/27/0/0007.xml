Since the beginning of the  war 835,796 pensions, including children&apos;s allowances, have been awarded.supplementary pensions and special allowances were made by the Special Grants Committee against 29 in the previous fortnight. Taking these grants as in continuation of those made by the Statutory Committee the total number to date is 4,475. 2.    Pensions to Soldiers.    The number of fresh claims to pen-sion of disabled soldiers dealt with by the Award to Soldiers Branch during the week ending 20th September was 6000 under previous Warrants Including 485 which had been rejected as compared with 5300 during the previous week, and the same number during the week before.award of pension, permanent or temporary, and 2405 by the grant of gratuities, and in 16 cases the claims were rejected.    Claims which had previously been rejected under former Warrants were admitted in 485 cases, 454 of the men being granted gratuitiesrejected which have been dealt with up to date is 6079 of which 1109 have been met by the award of pension and 6970 by gratuities.Appendix II shows that last week 36 grants ofOf the 6000 cases, 35^9 were disposed of by theand 31 pensions.The total number of claims previously
3,     Pensions to widows and dependants.   The work of awarding and authorising payment of Widows and &quot;Dep^ndan-b-a pensions in current oases is completely up to date.2546 re-assessments of dependants pensions were made during the week against 2031 last week and 1998 the week before.    There remain 12,809 cases to be dealt with. (Appendix III).   The 2546 cases this week include 180 dependants pensioned under the Old Warrant who have benefited by the re-assessment to the average extent of 4/5 a week, and 1378 dependent parents whose oases had been settled by a gratuity under the Old ^arrant but have now been placed on pension at an average rate of 7/8 a week.    The rest of the 2,546 receive no benefit, their pensions already being equal to pre-war dependence.       As regards re-examination as to entitlement under the New Warrant, no widows or dependants aases have been disposed of this week.       54 (widows and dependants) remain to be dealt with out of the original total of 4722 and these will be disposed of by the 30th vSeptember.       (Appendix IV).4.    Pensions to Parents - New Scheme. The details of this scheme have now been settled and the necessary forms are being printed.1,500 claims have been received and certain pre-llminary enquiries are being made in connection with them before investigation of facts as to income and disability is put in hand.A few pensions h-ve been raised to the minimum of 3/6 but extra staff will be required for the work entailed by the new scheme before rapid progress can be made.    Authority for the employment of 80 additional clerks has been obtained and these are being gradually appointed. 5*   Gratuities to Viidows.   As regards the 39,000 cases of men reported dead or missing between 1st July 1916 and 4thApr il
April 1917, practically all payments which can at present be made have been authorised and issue made by the Issue   -Office.   The cases of the missing men have been referred to the War Office as to presumption of death and payment of the  5 will be authorised as and when this point is settled in each case.6,   retard pay to Officers, etc.   The following is a summary of the progress made in the review of cases under the Officers Warrant of the 1st August, 1917Officers.      Retired pay has been re-examined in 417 oases, of which 328 have received increased rates, the average increase being  30 a year.     . *bout 933 remain to be re-examined.     17 officers &quot;slightly impaired&quot; have been placed on retired pay in lieu of gratuities previously granted, and 3 have had their gratuities increased by an average amount of  37.      31 gratuities in non-attributable cases have been increased, the average increase being  45.     4 gratuities of an average amount of  31 have been awarded where no grant was previously admissible.Nurses.       32 nurses have had their pensions increased, the average increase being  53.     4 have received increased gratuities the average increase being  33.Widows and Children.       13 Widows huve had their pensions increased from the intermediate rate to the highest, and 3 from the ordinary rate to intermediate,   the average increase being  47.     28 children&apos;s allowances have been increased the average increase being  5.2 Widows who had previously been granted gratuities where no pension was previously admissible, have been granted pension at the intermediate rate.Other
&apos; Other relatives.     No progress can be made until therules, of which a draft was submitted on the 26th August, have been agreed to by the Treasury.7,     frew Naval Orders In Council.     The Treasury have approved the regulations for pensions to Commissioned        Warrant Officers and to Warrant 0.*.fleers oi the Royal Navy disabled and to the families of such Warrant Officers deceased proposed to b- enacted by Order in Council and Memorials will be presented to Council with regard to these regulations and to the corresponding ones relating to Naval Officers in the course of next week.8.    Pension Appeals Tribunal.   631 Appeal Forms had beenreceived by the 15th September.     Appendix V shows the limited extent to which they had then been disposed of.     The delay has been due to the time taken in preparing the cases and to the preliminary references considered necessary by the Medical Branch at Chelsea.     This will now be obviated by a small Committee which has been set up by the Minister under the Chairmanship of the Parliamentary Secretary to decide on the evidence immediately available whether ,a oaae is to go before the Tribunal or whether a pension should be granted, the former category including.cases in which there is sufficient doubt to justify the benefit of it being giv n to the soldier and also those difficult cases in which the high qualifications of the Tribunal specially qualify them to give guidance.   There is now a steady flow of cases going to the Tribunal wh^ch is pro-posing to sit in Manchester in the 2nd week of October and subsequently in other large centres.
Treatment.g. General Practitioner Treatment.     The arrangementsmade by the National Health Insurance Commissioners for tho provision of general medical., attendance and treatment at home for discharged disabled men were referred to in the report for the period 25th to 51st August 1917. Regulations have now been issuod by tho Commissioners providing for tho system of remuneration to the medical men on the basis&apos; of the number of attendances and of the work done.   A copy of the Regulations is given in Appendix-VI. 10&apos;    Neurasthenia. (1)   The problom of the best way of dealing with discharged soldiers suffering from Neurasthenia presents one of the greatost difficulties to Local War Pensions Committees,   Residential treatment in Institutions can only bo provided for a limited number of these cases and indeed is only desirable in the serious cases which require constant supervision and attendance.     The lar;;e majority of cases are, however, of a less serious kind and provided that the man is not allowed to drift after his discharge experience has shown that those cases are eminently curable.     For their treatment Lieut-Colonel Sir John Collie, President of the Special Medical Board, now proposes tho establishment of out-patient clinics at which massage and electrical treatment can be given and at which local Doctors will be able to obtain advice a3 to the proper treatment of patients under their care.     A copy of Sir John Collie!s report Is given in Appendix VII.   The Minister has decided to initiate the experiment at once by the institution of an out-patient clinic at Lancaster Gate In close proximity to the Headquarters of the Special Medical Board and this yill bo followed by the establishment of similar clinics in other parts of the Kingdom.
(2)   Trie arrangements made for the examination of men suffering from neurasthenia by the Special Medical Board have hitherto applied to soldiers only.   It has now been arranged with the Board of Admiralty that sailors and marines discharged for tha same complaint will be dealt with by the Special Medical Board.(3)   The slighter cases of neurasthenia are particularly amenable to treatment in the form of light, regular work and certain experiments In this direction are now under consideration.   The Walthamstow Local Committee instituted some -jtime ago a scheme of light work on a farm lent to them/by the Walthamstow Urban District Council.   It cas initiated mainly with a view to the treatment of neurasthonic cases although men suffering from other complaints have been admitted. The men are given, as a rule, some three months work at market gardening and during that time are under the supervision of a foreman and an expert gardener. They arc sent to the farm on the recommendations of a medical referee and are required to work regularly and within their ability.    Further information is being obtained as to the success of this scheme in dealing with neurasthenic cases and, with a view to it being adopted elsewhere.   The Birmingham Local Committee have submitted a somewhat similar scheme for the employment of a limited number of men In the Parks belonging to the Town Council. 11.   Experimental Workshop for Artificial Limbs.   The Minister received on the 17th instant a deputation from the Queen Hary&apos;s Auxiliary Hospital at Roehampton, which had approached him with a view to recommending the establish-ment of a national factory for artificial limbs, but confined themselves to advocating a workshop for research and experimental work in connection with thesupply
supply of these articles.   As a result, the letter was written to the Treasury of which a copy is annexed aa Appendix VIII.The Minister has decided not to proceed with thewider proposition of establishing a Government Factory.manufactureApart from the drawbacks attaching to Government/ generally, which are liable to be accentuated in an establishment dealing with a limited class of productions in which considerable changes are likely, he concluded that the more promising line of progress lies in the direction of stimulating private inventions and productions, and aiming at a standardisation of parts which would enable the general engineering trade of the country to take part in the manu-facture.12.    General Schemes of Treatment.    Appendix IX contains a thereport ov schemes of treatment which have been submitted to the Ministry during the week ended 19th instant.   Among the schemes submitted are those for the treatment of neurasthenia promoted by the Walthamstow and Birmingham Losal CommitteoD to which reference has already been made, and a scheme for the use of Dowsing Institute for electrical and radium treatment. 13 * Individual Schemes of Treatment.   The table in Appendix X shows that in 97 individual cases sanction was given to treatment in Institutions which were not covered by schemes of treatment to which general sanction had already been given. 14.   Numbers under Treatment.   Appendix XI shows that 111 cases of discharged disabled men wero admitted to treatment during the week ended the 19th instant.   Of these, 106 wore treated in or at institutions.   The total number of cases under treatment at the end of the week vras 804.   The table shows also that 343 men discharged on account of lunacy had been classified as &quot;Service Patients&quot; under the special arrangements made by the Ministry of Pensions which have been referred to in previous reports.
Training.15.   Trade Advisory Committees, (l)   The published instructions for the treatment and training of disabled men provide in general terms the conditions under which training may be given.   According to No.23 of those instructions the Minister may lay down special conditions applicable to train-ing in particular trades.    In co-operation with the Ministry of Labour,       Central Trade Advisory Committees composed of an equal number of representatives of employers and workpeople have been formed wi th a view to advising the Minister as to tho conditions which should apply to their particular trades, and after prolonged conference with some of those Committees, several Supplementary Instructions have now been drawn up for certain trades.     Copies of the Instructions applying to training of Cinematograph operators and of skilled workmen in the furnishing trade are given in Appendix XII.   A feature of the arrangements made is the formation of Local Technical Advisory Committees of the trades in those centres whore theyIare sufficiently well represented and where training in a Technical Institution can be provided.   Consultation with representatives of trades was expressly recommon&amp;ed to all Local Committees in the General Instructions issued in July last and the proposal to form properly organised Local bodies will be a valuable dcvolcpcncnt of the general intention.(2)   Appondix XIII contains a report of Meetings of certain Trade Advisory Committees during the week.   This includes the C-old, Silver, and Jewellery trades, which it will be seen in the rpport are able to absorb a very substantial number of men, the Cinoma Trade and the Engineering and Ship-building trades.IS
16.   Training In optical Instrument making.   Negotiations are in progress with the Ministry of Munitions with a view to the training of a limited number of men in optical instrument making.   Employment in thi3 trade was much restricted before the war owing to the competition of American, German or Austrian manufacturers, but since these sources of supply were diminished or cut off, has very substantially increased.   This is largely owing to the demands of the Army, but apart from those demands it is generally recognised that the Industry is one for which further development may be looked after the war. In these circumstances, the trade is one in which training is eminently suitable.   Prom a Conference which has taken place with representatives of the Ministry of Munitions, it appears that the large majority of workers who have been taken on during the war in this trade, are women who have boon given about 6 weeks training in one or other particular process of the trade, but that a small number of both disabled men, and women, have received a more complete training of 6 months.   It is stipulated on the part of the Ministry that they can only recognise training in this trade which gives a man sufficient competence and skill to ensure a reasonable livelihood in normal times, but if with this condition, training can be provided, the Ministry may be able to help.   The Ministry of Munitions have undertaken to consult employers   and workpeople in the trade, with a view to arriving at the conditions under which training of this kind can be given.IV.   General schemes of Training.   Appendix XIV contains a repor of the schemes for training which have been submitted to the Ministry during the week ended the 19th instant.   The schemes include proposals from the Isle of Man for the employment of disabled men In basket making and In boot repairing, a scheme from the Manchester Local Committee for training in Cinema operating, a scheme from the South Western Counties JointCommittee
Committee for training in Electrical Engineering, and a further seheme from the same Committee for training in tailoring, boot and shoe repairing and clerical work. 18,     Individual Cases of Training.   Appendix XV shows tha* in 34 cases not covered by general schemes of training, sanction was given to tho training of disabled men during the week ended the 19th instant.19,     Numbers under Training.   Appendix XVI shows that 49 men wore admitted to training during the week and 238 were under training at the end of the week.    These figures are not altogether complete as a certain number of casos In which training was.commeneed under arrangements made by the Statutory Committee before the issue of tho Instructions by tho Ministry have not been notified.Organisation.20.     Special Orants Committee.   Meetings of the Special Grants Committee were held on the 11th and 18th September. The Fiiautes of these Meetings (of which only those of the former dato have as yet been confirmed) are annexed as Appendices XVII and XVIII.   The Committee settled the extent to which they would delegate their powers to the staff of the Ministry.   They considered and approved for submission to tho Minister now Regulations with regard to thesupplementation etc., of pensions to the families of officersandand to officers/with regard to educational grants,   They decided to propose to the Minister amendments and additions to the Regulations with regard to the supplementation btc.:, of the pensions of soldiers and sailors and of the families of soldiers and sailors.   They reported, by request of the Minister, on the elimination of a &quot;hardship&quot; condition in certain regulations dealing with Special Separation Allowancesto
to parents.   They passed general resolutions(1)   That in the case of disabled men In the Navy and Array pay should continue until the appropriate pension had been awarded and issued and that in the case of widows, children and dependants of sailors and soldiers, such arrangements should be made as would prevent the cessation of one payment before the&apos;commencement of the next.(2)   That the existing pensions for widows and dependants were inadequate and should be increased by 33V3 per cent.(3) That half the rate of the children!s allowances now authorised should be added to alternative pensions for widows.The various submissions and resolutions of the Committee are now under consideration of the Ministry. 21.   Schemes for Local Committees.   Since the 13th August 1917, the date of the last Report to the Statutory Committee of the Organisation Sub-Committee, two applications under Section 3 of the Naval and Military war Pensions etc., (Administrative Expenses) Act, 1917, for separate Local Committees have been received.   They wore made by the Urban District Councils of Heston and Isleworth and of Coulsdon and Farley respectively.    In each case the observations of the County Council concerned have been requested.In diriht cases since the same date the Minister of Pensions has decided that the application for a soparato Local Committee should be granted.   Those cases relate to the Boroughc of Llanolly, Tunbridge Jells, and worthing, and to the Urban Districts of Aborsychan, Abertillery, Bedwelty, Mbbw Vale and Tredegar.In four cases the applications have beerefused, vis., those relating to the Boroughs of Maldstone and Newcastle-Under-Lyne, and the. Urban Districts of Srith andof
of Gosport and Alverstoke. &apos; ,In three oases the applix&amp;tJLonJaa4-*be^LnJ^ viz., those relating to the Borough of Chatham&apos;and the Urban Districts of Beckenham-and Xong Eaton.As regards the three Irish cases in which it has been decided that Schemes should be framed by the Minister on the default of the County Council, the Chief Inspector for Ireland has reported as to the Bodies who should be Invited to recommend members of the Local Committees, and communications with these Bodies are proceeding. 22.   Reports of Inspectors.     Extracts from the reports of the Inspectors for the week ending 19th September are con-tained in Appendix XIX.     Very efficient work ia, reported from the Sunderland Committee, who are fortunate in having a number of experienced voluntary workers, and the work of the Disablement Sub-Committee is good.   Satisfactory reports have been received from Hull and Norwich and the accounts of the Doncaster Committee appear to be well kept.   The Inspector states that at present there is no urgent need for a training scheme for Great Yarmouth.   Some re-organisation of tho Monmouthshire Local Committee would appear to be necessary, but the Sub-Committee of Nanty&amp;lo and Blaina and Llanfrechna are working satisfactorily.   Administrative expenses loom largely In the reports from Waterford and Wexford. 23,   Committee on Treatment and Training of Officers.   A small Committee consisting of Sir Cyril Jackson, Sir Alfred Pearoo Gould and Dr. Garnett, with the Secretary to the Ministry now has been set up to deal with the Treatment and Training of Officers for which the new Officers Warrant gives the Ministry wide powers.   It held its first meeting on the 17th instant.244   Artificial Limbs Branch.   The Artificial Limbs Branch, which hitherto has been administered directly by theSecretary
Secretary, has now been made a branch eX the Finance Division.     The questions of supply and contract dealt with by this branch are distinctive and do not fall under any of the main divisions of the Ministryfs duties; but the magnitude of the work is not sufficient to Justify a separate division, and it is therefore necessary to bring it into the organisation by placing it in the division with which it has most affinity.Staff, etc25.     Numbers of Staff.   Appendix XX shows an addition of G8 to the staff of the Ministry during the week, 11 having been added to the Awards to widows Branch, and 58 to the Pensions Issue Office where there are now 17 holiday workers to replace girls on their annual leave.   The other branches remain much as they wore.    The staff on the books of the Ministry now comprise 276 men and 4079 women, or 4355 in all.The daily   ereoutage of absences during the week was 3*7 among&apos; the male and 5*5 among the female staff.22nd September 1917.

(1) For the purpose of defraying the cost of the medical benefit and of any domiciliary treatment provided as part of the sanatorium benefit of invalided soldiers to whom these Regula-tions apply the Commissioners shall determine the number of such soldiers resident at the commencement of each quarter in the area of each Committee.(2) There shall be debited to the General Medical Benefit Fund and carried to the credit of a special account in the books of the Commissioners to be called the Invalided Soldiers&apos; Medical Fund a sum calculated by multiplying the cost of medical benefit for a
quarter by the aggregate numbers at the commencement of each quaiter. of the year of insured invalided soldiers to whom these Regulations apply.(3) For the purpose of apportioning the sums payable out of the General Medical Benefit Fund to the several Committees under Article 12 (2) of the National Health Insurance (Payments to Insurance Committees) Regulations, 1914, the number to be ascertained at the commencement of each quarter under Article 12 (1) of those Regulations shall be reduced by the number of invalided soldiers to whom these Regulations apply, and who are insured persons resident in the area of the Committee at the commencement of that quarter.(4) The amount which would otherwise be payable to each Committee under Article 18 of the last-mentioned Regulations in respect of sanatorium benefit for any year shall be reduced by a sum equal to one penny half-penny multiplied by the aggre-gate numbers of invalided soldiers to whom these Regulations apply and who are resident in the area of the Committee at the commencement of each quarter of the year (other than members of the Havy and Army Insurance Fund), and a sum equal to the total reductions so made shall be debited to the General Sanatorium Benefit Fund and carried to the credit of the In-valided Soldiers&apos; Medical Fund.(5) If in the case of any invalided soldier to whom these Regulations apply it appears that between the date of his discharge and the date on which arrangements are made under these Regulations for his treatment on an attendance basis he has not been included in the list of any practitioner on the panel or institution the cost of medical benefit for a quarter shall be respectively debited and credited to the General Medical Benefit Fund, and the Invalided Soldiers&apos; Medical Fund for each quarter, if any, at the commencement of which he was not included in the list of a practitioner or institution, and a sum of one penny half-penny shall be respectively debited or credited to the General Sanatorium Benefit Fund and the Invalided Soldiers&apos; Medical Fund for each such quarter, if any.(6) For the purposes of this Article the expression &quot; cost of medical benefit&quot; for any period means the amount payable at the rate for the time being agreed upon by Approved Societies and Insurance Committees under Section 15 (6) of the National Insurance Act, 1911, in respect of the medical benefit of a member for that period, together with any sum payable out of moneys provided by Parliament towards the cost of the medical benefit of such member for the same period.6.

&apos; TREATMENT. OUTPATIENT CLINIC   FOR NEURASTHENICS.Report by Lieut-Colonel Sir John Collie, R.A.1.C.&quot;The Outpatient Clinic for Neurasthenia should be a comparatively inexpensive and yet effective way of dealing with the majority of cases in the greater part of their convalescence.A. The cases suitable would be:-(I).   Slighter cases directly on discharge from the Army.(II) Gases .;hen the effects of treatment in institutions require to be maintained from relapse.(III) Chronic cases which only improve very slowly.(IV) Cases who are attempting some work.B. It might also act in a consultative way, advising outside medical men about patients under their care whom they may care to send.C. It would probably also be of service in negativing wrong ideas or advice, such as that a patient requires a yearrs rests or requires special dieting or stimulants, and possibly be useful in preventing tho harm that sometimes comes from long-continued massage, electricity, crutches or splints acting as hindrances to recovery.D. In addition, for a neurasthenic individual to have his name on the Roll of sue)- a Clinic where the facts of his case are thoroughly knoi/n and appreciated, and where correct and disinterested advice can bo got when wanted and free of cost, puts a reservoir of moral force at his back which alone ..rill help many, especially the fearful and. timorous.    The slight cases, or those on the border-land of functional inefficiency, might be treated, but the best results are to be expected with simple contracturos orpalsies, tfhich prevent work, with inability to performcertain
certain movements satisfactorily, or cases with tics or habit spasas.   Nearly all cases with subjective pains and vague feelings are amenable to sugr o.:: tive improvement *   In a good many cases where the neurasthenia is largely mental and who often are emotional and anxious, the level of acting life might he considerably raised by regular suggestive advice at short intervale,Lany of the more profound cases which require residential treatment could be returned sooner from institutions, or discharged from hospitals, if it were known -that suitable medical after-care was freely available - the Outpatient Clinic becoming the logical sequel to care in these institutions.The ultimate Ideal would be to h a ve w linics in easily accessible parts (e.g., Peckham, Clapham, Dalston, kolloway) arranged to work with considerable elasticity, so that they would never be overwhelmed by unexpected numbers.Nothing but experience will enable an estimate of the rate of working reckoned as cases seen.    It will be slow at first, getting more rapid as dilution with old cases comes in.    Interviews of half an hour may be expected at first, scarcely averaging half this time later.   But the work must- be done thoroughly, exhaustively and impressively till its reputation is so built up that merely coming Into the room will benefit the patient.   The doctor must be in a comparitively fresh condition; if fatigued, or tired, his results are likely to be disappointing.     An hour of this work is probably as exhausting to the doctor as an hour of 6perating, or two hours of ordinary medical practice.   No one can do such work well and continuously.   Probably, three sessions a week is the optimum, or, if more is -worked, certainly not more than one session daily.
Each session should be attended by two doctors, ci chief and an assistant.    They could see patients separ-ately and confer when necessary.    By this arrangement, too, a staff of competent workers could be built up.    Each would always see his own cases, keeping private notes of details, and filling in on the clinic card any treatment suggested and the rate of improvement.noted.Certsin exercises, or physical treatment might be required, for which the Physical Department would be available at first.    Special training for some speech defects might pos Ibly be worth while later.If such a Clinic be started at Lancaster Gate, it should be open two sessions daily, each Chief and -Assistant working three sessions weekly on alternate days, and patients coming for further interviews on those days and sessions to see the.same doctors.    The unit would be a Clinic working two sessions daily six days of the week and having four Chiefs (one of whom would be Superintendent of the whole Clinic) and four, or more, assistants, with a clerk and an (orderly or nurse) attendant responsible for working and administrative arrangements.    Certain special arrangements could be made for Saturday work.
raps  rnv:- &apos;.-ypLetter to Treasury on Experimental Workshop for ArtificialLimbs *Sir,I am directed by the Minister of Pensions to acquaint you, for the information of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, that he finds it imperative to start immediately a Workshop for Research and Experimental V;ork in Connection with Artificial Limbs and Appliances *The necessity for such an institution will probably be obvioun; but it may be recorded that the great increase in the magnitude of the demand has raised the importance of Artificial Limbs and Appliances without stimulating invention to a corresponding extent.     It is found that many inventions contain elements of advantage while less desirable as a whole that other similar contrivances, and that difficulties arise in obtaining from makers the limbs etc. which combine the various features of advantage..     They naturally wish and arrange to manufacture their particular kind;.as wholes, and experiment and improvment are handicapped by these considerations.     A Government Experimental Workshop is therefore necessary in the interests of efficiency and progress; and it is expected also to lead to economy as special attention will be paid to the standardisation of parts which should increase the area of supply and diminish prices.It is proposed to establish this workshop in the neighbourhood of London, under the direction generally of the expert Advisory Committee for Artificial Limbs etc. with a highly skilled manager of mechanical training in charge.-   Trial of the productions will be made under instructions by thevariousyc rotary, peasury, *w&quot;. 1,
various Limbfitting hospitals, and when suitable patterns are determined upon steps will be taken to obtain manufacture under spe cificaticn instead of leaving different makers to supply their own particular patterns.The cost of the workshop and its staff cannot be estimated with any great accuracy at this early stage.   Besides the Lanager, a foreman will possibly be required, and a certain J number of mechanics and workers in different materials andgeneral labourers will be necessary; and materials and articles iEwill be procured from time to time.     There will also be periodical replacements of machinery etc., in addition to the initial outlay for motors, lathesj tools etc,     As a rough estimate a capital cost of  3000, and an annual expenditure of about  4,000 may be takentI am to invite Their Lordships1 early sanction to arrangements proceeding on these lines.     The salary of the Manager, and any cost for rent gr other items usually sanctioned! by them in detail will be put before them when matters haveprogressed sufficiently. . 1I am,Sir,IYour obedient Servant, H.N.. Secretary.
TREATMENT..Report of Schemes etc., submitted during the week ending 19th September 1917.__:_,__^An interview took place with a representative of the Dowsing Radiant Heat Institute who explained that their institution was used for giving free treatment to serving soldierd but that the London War Pensions Committee were unable to use it for discharged men as the institution had not up to now been approved.   Enquiries were made from the D,D.;&quot;.S. London Command and it was ascertained that the treatment given is of the most up to date type.   The London Committee have accordingly been Instructed to approach this institution with a view to making arrangements for treatment within the terms of Schedule I.2. The Walthamstow Local Committee havo submitted ascheme for the treatment of men requiring light open air work.   A plot of land of about 6 acres, formerly used for grazing goats, has been loaned for 2 years by the Local Education authority, and the District Council have ploughed -the land, provided the necessary implements, and have placed the services of a foreman and an expert gardener at the disposal of the War Pensions Committeo,    The scheme was sanctioned by the Statutory. Committee as one of training in market gardening but enquiry has shown that it was designed primarily as a scheme of treatment for neurasthenia and other discharged men requiring light &quot;work.     No one is admitted unless medically certified to require this form of treatment and to be suitable for it.     Up to the present 18 men have worked on tho fanm, 7 have obtained employment, 1 was not suited for the course, and 10 are still working. The c3&apos;.aa^:s of case accepted include besides neurasthenics, cases of tuberculosis and Heart Disease.   No wages are paid, but the men are&apos; given the usual allowances.   Further enquiry Is being made as to medical aspects and results of the scheme,3. The Birmingham Local Committee have submitted aproposal to treat a limited number of cases of neurasthenia by finding employment for them in the Parks of the City.   It is proposed that the men should work in small parties under the supervision of a foreman, the hours of labour being graduated according to their physical capacity as determined by tho medical referee.     The Park Committee are prepared to pay wages for the work done, and if any man- shows special aptitude:&quot; for the work the question of providing a regular course of training for him. would bo   considered.

JOTEI0IX  XIIITRAINING.TRADE   ADVISORY   COMMITTEES.Report for Week ending September 19th, 1917,Cold Silver and Kindred Trades.The Trade Advisory Committee expressed their willing-ness to take at least 1000 men for training.    It was agreed that the length of training in the less skilled processes should be for six months and in the more-skilled processes for a year.   The employer&apos;s contribution should be nil for the first month, 5/- per week for the second and third, 10/- for the fourth to sixth and 15/- from the seventh to twelfth months The training   to be given either wholly in a technical school, or partly in the workshop and technical school, or wholly in the workshop.This seems likely to be a very suitable opening for the more skilled type of disabled man especially if he has some artistic talent.Cinema Trade.A memorandum to be sent out by the Trade Advisory Committee to Local Technical Advisory Committees describing their functions was approved.Engineering and Shipbuilding.After many negotiations the trade unions have agreed as far as all woodwork processes are concerned to the following schemea) That men may enter a number of specified semi-skilled processes at rates of wage3 that make it unnecessary for theState
State to contribute anything.b) Any man so entering may deoide at the end of his third month to apply for an all-round training.   Thia training is to last for three years.   During the first eighteen months the expenses will be met partly by the employer and partly by the State.At the end of the first eighteen months the employer to guarantee a minimum ef 48/5 rising to 53/6 per week at the end of the second eighteen months.These recommendations will go before the main Engineering Committee next week.(Sgd.)

TRAINING.Report on Schemes of training for Week ended 19th September, 1917.I.2,The Local Committee for the Isle of Han have submitted a scheme for training disabled men in toy-making and basket making.In regard to toy-making the Local Committee have been asked to state the maximum period of the proposed training and their opinion as to the prospects of the men when trained obtaining permanent and remunerative employment in the Island.   With regard to basket making they have been informed that it Is considered advisable that training should be given in existing workshops whore at least a year&apos;s course is necessary, and enquiry has been made as to whether the demand for this class of labour is sufficiently great in the Island to justify so long a period ef training.In reference to their scheme for training disabled men in boot repairing on premises provided by voluntary subscription the same Committee have been informed that this trade will probably shortly be declared a Special Trade.   Pending the issue of the Regulations for such training, sanction is given for the Committee to proceed on the lines proposed by them provided that they are prepared to make any alterations necessary to bring the scheme into conformity with the Regulations, when issued and that a fee of 7/6 per man per week is not exceeded.The Manchester Local Committee have submitted a scheme fcr training disabled men in Cinematograph operating at the Manchester School of Technology, the fees being 10/- per man per week.   As the usual fees for such instruction are 7/6 per man per week , the Committee have been asked to ascertain vfhether there are any special circumstances which render such a high fee necessary -especially in view of the fact that instruction Trill only be given in the mornings, the afternoons being devoted to practical work at the Cinema house.sameWith regard to a commercial course also submitted by the rocal Committee, they have been informed that a maximum fee has been found sufficient to cover all expensesof 7/6 has been found sufficient to cover all expenses of this course in other places, and that no fee exceeding 7/6 can be sanctioned unless an estimate is previously submitted showing the out of pocket expensesit is proposed to incur.   The attention of the Committee has been drawn to the fact that it is not considered desirable to train men in commercial subjects unless they have been educated up to the age cf 16 in a secondary school or a school of similar grade, or have special qualifications for this work.The V/estern Counties Joint (Disablement) Committee have applied for the sanction to a proposal for providing a six months1 course in Electrical Engineering for disabled men at the Swindon Corporation Electrical Department.    information has been requested as to the exact processes which will be taught, the number of hours of instruction which will be given per week, the fees, if any payable,&quot;- the wages, if any, which will be received during the period of training, the methods by which men will be selected fcr admission to the course, the steps which will be taken to insure that the training given Is satisfactory, the attitude of local associationsof
of emplc^fers^&amp;nd workpecrple in the trfciie^--^xnaoern&amp;d and the views of the Swlndon Local Committee n,n the proposed scheme.4, Messrs Nicholson and Lord of Walsall have applied tothe Minister of trunitions for facilities for the erection of new buildings in connection with the scheme for training disabled rt&amp;xi\ at their works under the auspices of the V/alsall Local Committee. In view cf the fact that the training already given in Messrs Nicholson and Lord&apos;3 temporary building has been satisfactory this application has been supported by the Minister of Pensions and the necessary licence has been granted by the Minister cf Munitions.5. The Church Army havo been infdrmed that If they wish thecourse of training at their Farm Colony at Hampstead to be sanctioned as. part of the scheme of the Essex Local Committee, they should furnish details of the work done by them to the Board of Agriculture and put before the l-ilnister a statement showing whether both as regards the management and in other respects the Colony is approved by the Board and can properly be sanctioned as part of the Local Committee?s scheme.6. The West of England Joint Committee have submittedproposals for training disabled men in Tailoring, Boot and Shoe Repairing and Clerical Work at the Merchant Venturer&apos;s Tcehnioal College, Bristol.The Joint Committee have been informed that the out-Of* pocket expenses incurred in carrying on the proposed classes will be paid by the Minister for a period cf six months at the end of which, they have been instructed to furnish the Minister with a return showing the details of these expenses and the number of men who have been trained in each class, In order that the question as to the advisability of continuing the classes may be decided. They have also been authorised to bring tho training in these subjects into operation at wnce, without waiting for the appoint-ment of the local Technical Advisory Committees.

Grave complaints have been reoeived by the Speoial Grants Committee of the hardship that is often caused by the fact that in many cases there is a considerable interval between the date on which the Army pay is stopped and the pension received.   The Special Grants Committee would urge the Minister also to make such arrangements in the case of the widows, children and dependants of sailors and soldiers as will prevent the cessation of on-i payment before the commencement of the next.On the recommendation of Sir Frederick Stopford seconded by Mr.Gosling it was agreed to make a grant of  22. 10, 0   in the case of 0.P./561 to Miss L.B.Lemmey of Canterbury, which had been previous-ly apr;roved by the Statutory Committee to enable her to attend a training sourse at Battersea Polytechnic(3)   Where a gratuity is payable out of public funds the income value of any such gratuity shall be taken into account in determining the amount of such allowance.(4)   Ho such allowance shall be granted or renewed for a longer period than six months.
On a motion by Mr.Gosling seconded by Mr.Ben.Turner thefollowing resolution was agreed to -&quot;that the Speoial Grants Committee are unanimously of opinion that the existing pensions for widows and dependants as laid down in the new Royal Warrant and Order in Council are inadequate and they urge the Pensions Minister that all pensions for widows and dependants be increaeed by 33.1/3rd per cent while the present conditions continue.&quot;8,     On a motion by Sir Frederick Stopford seconded by Mr.Marshallthe following resolution was agreed to -&quot;that provision for the training of officers1 widows and dependants be added to the Regulations for Officers previously submitted to the Pensions Minister, in view of the fact that it has been decided by the Pensions Ministry that these training cases are now to be dealt with by the Speoial Grants Committee from their fund.&quot;9.    On a motion by Mr.Gosling seconded by Corporal Linard thefollowing resolution was agreed to -&quot;that the Pensions Minister be asked to add to the Alternative Pensions for widows half the rate of children&apos;s allowances authorised by the new Royal Warrant and Order in Council,&quot;10.   The next meeting of the Speoial Grants Committee was fixed for Tuesday the 2nd of October at 2.30 p.m.

SPECIAL GRANTS COHHITTEEFORFEITURE SECTIONThe Section have held several meetings and decided a number of cases arising under Section 3 (1) (f) pf the Act of 1915,     The meetings were however mainly devoted to the consideration and examination of policy and amongst other matters the boarding out of children in forfeiture cases, and the notification to Local Committees of prosecutions * of wives and dependants of service men were discussed. -It was decided that steps should be taken to obtain early notification of impending prosecutions and that the question of asking Local Committees to assume the responsibility for boarding out children should be further considered.The Section were Informed that as a result of the enormous increase in the work since it was taken over by the Statutory Committee, and difficulties in obtaining suitable staff, considerable delays occurred in dealing with cases but that changes in the adrriinisti^ation had been made by the Ministry and active steps taken to dispose of the arrears of work and ensure efficiency in the Branch.P.G.

ORGANI2ATION   BRANCH.Extracts from Reports of Inspectors for week ended 19th September, 1917.MONMOUTHSHIRE   LOCAL   COMMITTEE.As regards the Quarterly Account of this Committee, after spending two days with the Secretaries of the Sub-Committees of Magor and St,Mellons and after struggling through a confusion of papers and files, the Inspector was able to obtain the necessary figures for the Quarter ending December 1916.   as the receipts for January to June are stillvin the Almoner1s hands it was hopeless to attempt to obtain the figures for that period. The Accounts are now with the Looal CommitteefS Secretary.Nantyglo and,Blaina Sup^Committee.Two meetings have been held recently to donsider the question of the re-organization of this Sub-Committee as reoommended by the Local Committee at the last meeting.   The Sub-Committee will meet weekly until everything is in order, and the work is now proceeding smoothly.The Chairman, who is a Minerrs Agent, is a capable man. He explained to the Committee their responsibility under the new conditions and the necessity for closely observing the Regulations.^Bedwelty Sub-Committee,-This Sub-Committee is likely in the near future to obtain autonomy as it is most anxious to break away from the County Committee.   The Inspector fears that there are irregulari-ties.   He does not recommend that they be granted any additional power,, as if so, this Sub-Committee may think it is the result of their agitation that has brought about the change in spite of their bad record.-Llanfreohfa Sub-CommitteeVisited by the Inspector&apos; on 12th instant.-   The new system as put forward by the Local Committee has been adopted and is now in working order.-   Everything is working smoothly. The Accounts^ are- so arranged that particulars of expenditure up to date can be ascertained in a few minutes.-WEOORD , LOCAL-  COMMITTEE.Since the Inspector&apos;s last visit a- new Secretary has been appointed.   The late Secretary presented the Audit Abstract for the Quarter ended 30th June: In which the expenditure amounted to  85. 4.- 9-. and the administrative expenses to  16. 9.8. Recoverable advances for the Quarter totalled  48. 18. lu
4 The Secretary complained of the difficulty of keeping the accounts owing to the mass of correspondence.WATERFORD LOCAL COMMITTEE.This Committee!s accounts have been closed and audited to the 31st March, 1917, but the Abstract forwarded does not contain the Regulations and Sub-heads as required and the administrative expenses have not been set out in detail.     The Secretary was notified that this Return must contain the particulars required under the various headings. The administrative expenditure amounts to  100, 15.. 0. Until now the Secretary has been unpaid but a new appointment will be made at the next meeting of the Committee for a salaried Secretary at  100 a year.SUNDERLAND LOCAL COMMITTEE,This Committee is fortunate in the number and quality of the voluntary workers at their disposal.     There is an efficient system of visiting and reporting by persons experienced In these matters and reliable information in this way is placed at the disposal of the Committee.     The work is fairly heavy, the number of cases assisted averaging about 900, and the aggregate expenditure for the eight months to the 31st August reached the total of  11,764.     Both the Secretary (Town Clerk) and the Treasurer (Borough Treasurer) devote considerable time to the work which is well organised, -and in this connection it is&apos; perhaps well that the Ministry should be informed of the attitude these gentlemen and others who are doing similar work in the Northern Districts are at present taking up with regard to the question of remuneration for their services.Opportunity is being taken by them of the request for an estimate of the Local Committeefs expenses for the period (17th May, 1917, to 31st March, 1$18) to put forward claims for such remuneration.     In the case of Sunderland both the Secretary and Treasurer have placed on the estimate a sum of  100 each as their personal remuneration; this, it is understood, has received the support of both Local Committee and Borough Council,     It is stated by these gentlemen that they never undertook to perform the work In a honorary capacity and have only waited the opportunity to prefer their claims.     There is evidence of some understanding between the Borough Officers in these Northern Districts on the question so that the claims should not be dismissed without consideration.On the other hand, the position of a very large number of voluntary workers throughout the district must be borne in mind.     Other claims will speedily be put in if the Secretary and Treasurer are not prepared to continue the work under existing conditions.     It is suggested that though the claims should not be dismissed they should be cut down and from  25 to  50 per annum be granted for each officer.By request the Inspector attended a meeting of the Disablement Sub-Committee and was present during the interrogation of a number of disabled men, of whom
some 80 were present.    There was a fairly large number of oases of men disoharged without pensions or whose oases are still under consideration and whose present needs have to be met from Local CommitteeTs funds.     Many of these are genuine oases but a few are not so worthy.The work of the Sub-Committee is efficient and valuable the assistance they receive from the voluntary visiting staff being particularly good.HULL LOCAL COMMITTEE.The Inspector tested many cases and only found two gut of order.     A few old cases were still being relieved under the wrong Regulation but these will be now amended.A solicitor has been appointed Secretary at  250 a year. He is extremely capable and liked by applicants and workers alike. This Committee was well organised before but is still better today.Advances take 50 per cent of the expenditure.     A most oareful account of these is kept and they \re being very well watched and recovered.     The accounts are in very good order and a most careful analysis has been made.HORV/IOH LOCAL COMMITTEE.The work is proceeding satisfactorily in this Committee area.     They have a fairly large number of forfeiture cases and the accomodstion which can be given to children by the Guardians is almost exhausted.     If the number of cases increase much more it Is anticipated that the Local Committee will have to house the children.The administrative expenses of this Local Committee now amount to  700 a year.GREAT YARMOUTH LOCAL COMMITTEE,The Inspector discussed several points of administra-tion with the members and also the matter of treatment and training and the needs of Great Yarmouth in this respect.     The members are reported to have a good grasp of the Regulations.     At present there is no urgent need for a training soheme in Gt. Yarmouth.D039CASTER LOCAL COMMITTEE.The organization is reported good; cases are well considered and grants cautiously made.     Payments are made centrally.     Six cases of claims for Alternative Pensions are pending.     Some 50 oases are being dealt with for rent allowances while there are two or three special allowances being paid. Education Grants do not appear to be well known; there are no cases.The Inspector reports this to be a most careful Committee, whose accounts are in very good order, with only  3 Advances outstanding as irrecoverable from the commencement of their work up to date.
