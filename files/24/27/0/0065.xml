Col, Jones[This Document is the Property of His Britamiic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.   September 1917.SECRET.NAVAL &quot;WEEKLY APPRECIATION-No. 18.L 1 &apos;0*J *   TFee7c ended 23rd September.NAVAL OPERATIONS.There are no important movements of any of the enemy main fleets to record.Further deep mines have been laid off the North-East Coast of England.The monitor &quot; Terror &quot; bombarded Ostende, Atelier de la Marine, on the morning Zanders of the 22nd September with satisfactory results.   Thirty-six rounds were fired and reports and Dover from observers state that most shots fell within 500 yards of the centre of the target, at area, least three hits being obtained on the Atelier de la Marine, and one on the Quai de Pacqbots. Enemy batteries were in action.  Photographs show 1 shop to be completely demolished and 7 shops damaged, 1 shed with submarine under partially demolished, and 1 floating dock sunk with a list.During these operations one of our low-flying patrols of three machines, for the protection of the Fleet, met three enemy seaplanes, and shot all of them down into the sea, one enemy pilot being rescued by our destroyers. One of our pilots, who had a forced landing in the sea, was also picked up.The weather has, on the whole, been unfavourable for air operations, but bombing squadrons from Dunkirk have carried out raids on Thourout and Cortemarck Railway Stations and on the Aerodromes at Aertrycke, Sparappelhoek, Thourout and Ghistelles.On the loth September a bombing raid was carried out on enemy shipping between Ostende and Blankenberghe, bombs being dropped on destroyers and trawlers or drifters. One large destroyer was hit amidships, and one, probably two, out of a group of four trawlers, sunk.On the same day, during a late anti-submarine patrol, a large America seaplane was attacked by two enemy seaplanes, which were engaged by the aeroplane escort. One of the enemy machines was shot down in flames, the other was chased towards some enemy destroyers and submarines.On this day also, one of our patrols engaged a formation of enemy aeroplanes, destroying one and probably a second.The total weight of bombs dropped during the week was about 14^ tons.The destroyer &quot; Contest &quot; was torpedoed by an enemy submarine in the approaches Downs, to the English Channel and sank on the 18th September.Light forces from Harwich have captured the Dutch steamer &quot; Groningen,&quot; proceeding Harwich from Norway to Rotterdam with a cargo of pyrites and coal, also Swedish steamer area. &quot; Bergvik,&quot; with 2,000 tons of German coal.The destroyer &quot; Thisbe &quot; was mined or torpedoed off Terschelling Island on the 22nd Dutch September there were no casualties and the vessel has been towed, in. Coast.The Rear-Admiral, iEgean, reports that minelaying operations were carried out Mediter-successfully on the 18th, 17th and 18th September, in the approaches to Aivaii (Turkey ranean. in Asia).(0 654)   50   9/17   H &amp; S
Number ofsubmarinesoperating.Actions with enemy submarines.ATTACK UPON ENEMY (SUBMARINES.The number of large enemy submarines believed to have been operating during the week is 22 or 23, their chief area of activity having been to the West of the British Isles and France. This is approximately the same number as were operating during the previous week.The encounters with enemy submarines in Home Waters again show a reduction in number, but it is most probable that two submarines have been destroyed this week, one by airship and the other by seaplane.The following Table shows the number of actions with enemy submarines in Home Waters during recent weeks and the nature of the craft which have engaged them : Nature of Craft.	1 Week ended September 2nd.

Submarines possibly sunk are not included.Losses of The figures given last week showed the rate of loss per annum of the various typesfearhf SUb&quot;     enemy submarines and the following additional information may be of interest, as it illustrates another point of view of the question.Taking the number of submarines with which Germany commenced the War and adding the number of submarines Avhich the Germans have built and commissioned during the War, their losses work out as follows : U. Boats   ..      ..      ..      ..   32 per cent.U.B. Boats ..      ..      ..   31 per cent.U.C. Boats ..       ..       ..   34.5 per cent.These percentages cover losses in all seas where their submarines have operated, viz :  the Baltic, North Sea, Atlantic, and Mediterranean.If submarines operating in the Mediterranean are excluded, the percentages of losses are increased to the following : U. Boats   ..      ..      ..      ..   38 per cent.U.B. Boats ......40 per cent.U.C. Boats ......44 per cent.These figures also afford evidence of the percentage of submarine crews which have been lost by the enemy.

On the other hand, as will be seen from the Table in the Appendix, the percentage of losses to sailings of British Steamships to and from the United Kingdom is not so low as last week, as the total tonnage afloat this week was considerably below the average.The tonnage of Allied and Neutral Vessels lost is also the lowest on record during the period of unrestricted warfare.The following is a Comparative Statement of the Number of all British Merchant Areas in Vessels sunk, damaged, or molested, and of all Allied and Neutral Merchant Vessels sunk ^&quot;ch in the last two weeks by Submarine and Mine, according to areas : vessels lost.Area.British Vessels.Sunk.Arctic and White Sea Atlantic (North)   ...

METHODS OF DEFENCE.917 ships have been convoyed this week as compared with 832 last week and 905 Convoy, the previous week. Only 2 of these were lost as against 5 last week and 3 the previous week. The two losses are one ship of the North Atlantic convoy, and one engaged in the French coal trade. In addition, 2 other convoyed vessels were torpedoed, but in each case were towed into port. The comparative numbers and percentages of losses in convoy are shown in the following Tables : Inward.	Week ended 15th		Week ended 22nd		Total from commence-			September.

This figure is arrived at after allowing armament, for 717 vessels fitted for armament which have been lost during the war.   The number of guns now available amounts to 2,907.As a result of favourable reports in regard to dazzle painting of ships it was decided Dazzle that all merchant vessels and armed merchant cruisers should be painted in this manner, Pamtmg-and the necessary staff of designers, modellers, &amp;c, has been organised. Approximately 150 ships have been or are being painted, including some standard ships and armed merchant cruisers. In addition a warship of each of several classes has been so painted and designs are in preparation for trial on submarines, sloops and other vessels. Designs have also been supplied to United States destroyers at the request of Admiral Sims, and full information has been furnished to the Naval Attaches of the prhicipal Allies.
Mine pro- The Otter and Paravane equipments which have now been fitted to about 700 vesselstection are giving good results. Except in one doubtful case no ship so fitted has been sunk by a gear&apos;        mine, whilst the equipment lias frequently led to the location of enemy minefields.On three occasions merchant ships fitted with Otters have observed an enemy mine rise to the surface after having been deflected and severed.from its moorings by their Otters, and three of His Majesty&apos;s ships fitted with Paravanes have passed safely through enemy minefields previously unsuspected. The information thus obtained enabled the minefields to be swept up.-   MOVEMENTS OF GERMAN VESSELS.Four enemy merchant ships have this week arrived at Norwegian ports and six have left.  None have arrived at or left Rotterdam.A German raider believed to be the motor sailing vessel &quot; Seeadler &quot; was reported to have been off Raratonga (Cook Islands) on the 30th of August and the 4th of September. She had not previously been heard of since March when she was reported in the South Atlantic.GREEK NAVAL INTELLIGENCE.An arrangement has now been come to between Captain Clifton Brown, Head of the British Naval Mission, and the Greek Minister of Marine, whereby the Head of the Mission will have executive control of the Greek Fleet under the Ministry of Marine. As long as the Head of the Mission is at the Ministry of Marine he will issue his orders through the competent departments and no orders relative to movements of ships will be issued without his. approval. If required, the Head of the Mission may assume command of the Greek Fleet, and officers of the Mission may be given direction of any other department of the Navy or Ministry of Marine.When this arrangement is ratified it Avill put an end to the present anomalous position of the Greek Fleet.SPANISH NAVAL INTELLIGENCE.The appointment of the new Spanish Minister of Marine, Rear-Admiral Florez y Carrio, seems to have wrought a change in the obstructive methods of the Navy, which have resulted from the Germanophile sympathies of many of its officers. The orders given by the Spanish Government for the patrol of their waters have not hitherto been properly carried out, but it is noticeable that since Admiral Florez took office the com-plaints of attacks and sinkings by submarine in Spanish waters have become fewer, though it is not known how many ships are employed in Coast Patrol. The Spanish Government have been loth to admit that a ship is sunk in their waters, and various pretexts have been resorted to in order to avoid making the admission.It is satisfactory to note that the Spanish Government are enforcing their decree regarding the internment of any submarine which for any reason enters their ports. Two German submarines which recently entered their waters have been interned.Naval Staff,21th September, 1917.
