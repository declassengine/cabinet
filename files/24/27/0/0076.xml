%fl REPORT BY THP. UIHISTHY 07 LA:OUR OS THK ATTSTUES 0 1  0? EMPLOYEES AM i&amp;PLOYLI) TO THE V/HITLEY REPORT.lcnrfo-r- As a result of the publication and distribution of thecoieipn.-   - &quot;Thitley Report ordered by the Cabinet, it is now possible to - i  form a fairly dear estimate of tho attitude of industry to the proposals oontained in it.   In view of the wido interest taken in the Report ospeoially as a result of the endorsemairt^ r\\ i    of it by the Commissioners on Industrial Unrest,, it isdesirable that the Cabinet should decide at an early date to approve or disapprove the principle of the Report,   If the * Cabinet approve the principle, there will not be any need of legislation, and the actual carrying out of the recommenda^:&quot;-tions will rest with Trade Unions and&apos; Employersr Assooiationr but it will be necessary for the Ministry of Labour, to approach the different bodies concerned to arrange conferences draft schemes, and generally to take steps to ensure that the proposals receive full consideration.   Further, the establis&amp;-ment of Joint Standing Industrial Councils on the ^verament*s suggestion, although the basis of the Councils will be voluntary, implies^ degree of Government reeognltdon hitherto conceded to no industrial association, and will be regarded as entitling the new organisation to a special position in relation to the Government,(Sec page 6)rorcOAilcm The Cabijaefs minute of June 7th 1917, under which theof the      Tteport was circulated, was as follows Keport      &quot;The T,7ar Cabinet decided that:-In the first inetanoe, the Ministry of Labour should circulate the Report to the leading Trade Unions and Employers&apos; Associations, and also to the Commissioners on Industrial Unrest, with a view to ascertaining their general attitude to the proposed Industrial Councils at an early date.&quot; Subsequently instructions were given for the publication of the Report as a Command Paper, and for Its issue to the Preee, The Ministry of Labour circulated the Roport with a---- oovering letter, of which copy is attached, asking forobservations upon it, to -146 Trade Unions 37 Federations of ^rade Unions 107 Employers&apos; Associations and Federations and the following general organisations - The Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congress, The General Federatioav of Trade Unions, The Federation of British Industries.The prinoiple of seleotion was to&quot;include the national, organisations of all the great Industries, and also those other organisations which, without including a majority of the workers or firms for whioh they catered, had a large membership and could claim to represent an important section of industrial opinion.In response to applications for further copies, for the use of exeoutive committees and councils and affiliated bodies, between 10,000 and 11,000 copies of the Report have been distributed.The Ministry of Labour established a small section to deal, with the Report and special Officers were sent by invitation to explain the Report and hear expressions of opinion upon it, to 7 Trade Unions, 3 Employers&apos; Assoc-iatioas, and Z Joint Conferences^ Requests for five other Conforeaeoe have been received,

Employers1 Associations and Federations. Joint Conferences. and from the Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Con-gress, the federation of British Industries and the National Alliance of Employers and Employed,-   A grouped list of organisations that have sent observations,, indicating the character of their observations, is attached (Appendix 1.)The. Ministry has information also that several important organisations, which have net sent in replies, are giving favourable consideration tc the Report.-   The Parliamentary Committee expressed general approval of the Report with the reservation that the action taken cn the recommendations t therein should be of a voluntary character.   It also arranged for a discussion of the Report at the recent Trade Union pongress; after discussion it was decided to refer the matter to a speoial Committee whioh the Parliamentary Committee was to set up to deal with the question of Reconstruction.Of the 103 replies none opposed the principle of the Report.86 (including 57 Trade Unions and Federations, 25 Employers1 Associations 4 General Organisations) expressly approved the principle;12 (including 7 Trade Unions and Federations and 3 Employers1 Associations) state conditions that they think   should be attaohed to the establishment of Joint Industrial   Councils, without stating expressly whether they approve or disapprove the principle; or a^e Indefinite;5(inoluding 2 unions,.and three Employers1 Associations) oppose thu application of the proposals to their industries.The principal conditions put forward by the different organisations are mentioned in connection with the diffioul&amp;ie ties of the scheme below in Section 6,In the course of the Inquiry the Ministry was informed that the Building Trade,.the Painters, the Plasterers, the China, and Pottery industry, and the Printing Trade were alreadjr at work on the establishment of Joint Standing Industrial Councils, when the Whitley Report was published; whioh indicates that it is in harmony with current ideas as to the future regulation of industry. -Tha Report was received with groat interest by the Press. All the morning and evening papers devoted leading articles to it and published large extracts.   The comments were all favourable, though some papers did not sec in the proposals of the Report more than a suggestion for extending and improving Conciliation Machinery. .The T.7eokly Press was, in the main, equally favourable, -but hostile criticism both of the practicability and of the desirability of. the proposals was the line taken by the Hew Statesman and the New Age.The Labour Press, with the exception of the Labour Leader was, in the main, favourable.   The technical and employers&apos; organs were divided, the fear being expressed by some that the scheme of tho Report would lead to undue intorferenoe with the management. .V.Tith thw exception of the Yorkshire Commiesicners who did. not refer to it by name,  all the Commissionei-s on Industrial Unrest endorse.the principles and proposals of the Thitley Report,It is worth noting that, independently, cf the iefurencos to the &apos;7hitlev Report, tho. -Commissioners generally, as a
li result of their inyestir-ations. reach conclusions similarffj to those of the Jhltley Committee.The principal grounds on which they support their recommendations are as follov/s;I. The neeC for Employers to meet the representatives of the Turkmen regularly in order to get into touch with their views on improvement of working conditions, etc.2. The likelihood that joint representative bodies wi^l deal more successfully with disputes in their own trades than oan he done by any Court of Arbitration.3. The feelin;; both amon;; employers and workmen that the Government has interfered too muoh in the regulation of industry, and that their mutual relations oan be settled better without such interference.4.-The need for a new spirit of partnership, uhich will lead to a greater participation in the fruits of industry on the part of the workers, and closer oo.-operation betvyeer^ them and the employers in questions of general policy.Further most of the industrial causes of the present unrest, laid bare by the Commissioners, may be attributed %0 the neglect of the principles, aa  the absence of an organisation on the lines of the \hitley Report.     The selection of men for Kilitary Service, the application of restrictive regulations contained in the munitions of &quot;far Acts, payment by results, bad time-keeping&apos;, allegations of bullying by foremen, and the decentralisation of administra-tion generally, so strongly insisted on by the Commissioners^ are all examples of the kind of work that would naturally fall to suoh an organisation as is proposed by the Report.tioulties The enquiry has brought out clearly the practicaldifficulties which vdll have to be faced, if the Government approve the Report.     It should be noted, however, that the i  realisation of these difficulties has not prevented the great majority of the associations that have replied from supporting the proposals.The chief difficulties may be grouped under the following headings: -(a) The delimitation of Industries.     It is difficult to say precisely&quot;where one industry stops and another begins, so that there would be a difficulty in determining tho exact province or constituency of each council.     This is a diffi-culty, however, which Industrial Councils are not alone in facing.     It is an obstacle to a precise and logical application of any form of social control which does not apply indiscriminately to all industry;   State regulation, state ownership, state operation, trade union organisation, collective bargaining, all have   to meet the difficulty of the border-line case. The difficulty is capable of a praeti-Oal solution if not of a strictly logical one, and can be met by joint conferences, cross-representation and similar devices.    Trades that form integral parts of morefihan one industry   (as the Dyeing Industry forms a part both of the  bollen and Cotton Industries) will be represented on the council of eaoh industry of whioh they form a section, (k) Fear of Interfering with Existing Conciliation iMachinery.One union and four or rive employers&apos; associations are--&apos;adverse to participating in the formation of an Industrial Council for fear that it should harm the existing satisfae-tory machinery for dealing with disputes.   Others suggest that the existing  maohinery is capable of performing any funotiono that an industrial Council will undertake.    As to t2ie first of these objections, the Report ia ouite explicit, tt contemplates no interference rritb existing&quot;conciliation machinery which Is irking satisfactorily.     The neu Industrial Councils would be charged with matters of oonaaon interest to both employers and workpeople, ivhioh fall outside the scope of existing conciliation boards.    Some industries   might decide to merge their cctticili-ationmachtiary
In the Industrial Councils or subordinate it to them, and in every case the new organisation should of course he related to the old;   but conciliation would inmost cases be a subordinate function of the&apos; new bodies,.(c) Opposition from,.5&amp;ployers.&apos;.-&quot; There.:,js evidence, that some employers fear any further concession to the unions.   Doubts are expressed of the advisability of works coflsmitteec on the . ground&apos;that they would hamper employersT freedom of.action and initiative,&apos;, and thusi.check the introduction of improved methods  J of production.    Evidently there, was some feartjiat:&quot;the,&quot; terms ,/&apos; of reference o f Indus trial C ounc iis, as proposed. In the Report., are too wide and &quot;too vague. ;&apos;  -Trade Union fears. The fear: Is expressed that the right to strike might be imperilled;-   this seems however to be based on the assumption that section 21 pf&apos; the Report proposes. -compulsory arbitration, which is not the oase..    Small unions fear that they will be swamped by the larger unions and competing unions exhibit signs of jealousy, as is the oase also with employers&apos; organisations.     There is a feeling that the constitution and functions of the National, District and TTorks Committees will&apos;have to be oarefuliy defined..     it should be noted that the Report itself recognises this need and proposes to meet it by leaving to the existing organisations, in consultation with one another and the&apos; Govexrrment, the task of devising constitutions and settling functions. &quot;&apos;:&apos;
(e)   Constitutional problems. The constitutional problems involved are of great complexity.   So many of the Trade Unions and Employers5 Associations will claim representation, that it would be difficult to give representation proportional to membership to all, without making the Councils unwieldy. Further, sectional interests conflict and sectional organisations will refuse to co-operate in the establishment of an industrial organisation, unless their sectional interests are adequately safeguarded; in some cases they olaim the exclusive ri^ht to discuss and settle sectional questions.   The existing system of joint boards and committees for collective bargaining, to which the new organisation would have to be related, is not constructed on uniform principles, the boards being sometimes looal, sometimes sectional, i*e. devoted to a single branch of an industry, and sometimes both.   There is the further difficulty that some of the most important trade unions have their membership spread over several industries.   This is the case with some of the great Craft unions, the General Labour Unions and the chief Womens&apos; Organisations.   Associations of fore-men, mines officials and managers, and certain professional associations , such as those in engineering, might also claim a place on an Industrial Council, which they have not claimed oh the joint boards of the past. One of the City Companies has already olaimed a plade.The relation of Works committees and the unions is a difficult problem; employers demanding that works committees Shall be representative of employers irrespective of union membership (as ii? the case with check-weighmen) the trade union insisting on trade union representation or control.   This is a problem whioh can only be worked out by each industry for itself.   In some trades works committees will probably be found necessary.If the basic principle of the IThitley Report is sound, namely, that there are in every industry matters of common interest to every one engaged in the industry, these clifficulties can be overcome.   Constitutional arrangements for securing due consideration without over-re presentation of each of the sectional interests concerned can v/ith good will be settled by mutual consultation.   The willingness of existing organisations to co-operate sincerely in establishing Industrial Councils would depend very largely on the status and functions whioh the Government propose to give to the Councils,Further, the difficulties depend largely on the assumption that the Councils will have executive functions similar to&quot; those of existing organisations.   This is not altogether the pase.   At first, at any rate, they will mainly be consultative and mediatory-advising the Cabinet and executive Departments of the Government, and mediating between oonflioting interests f&amp;ithin the industry.if) Functions^ If the settlement of wa/ves and oonditions is left to exisoing joint boards it is objected that there is not enough work left to justify a new organisation.   On the other hand the indefinitenes3 of the terms of reference of the proposed Councils frightens some employers and unions.   The t,vo objections mi&apos;;ht be said to cancel out; but it &quot;ill be
desirable that the Government should indicate precise pieces of work that it wishes joint industrial oouncils to undertake and the exact place which it proposes they should hold In the national, economy.   There are a number of questions on which the. Government will need the united and considered opinion of each large industry in connection with reconstruction, for instance. Demobilization, apprenticeship, the carrying out of Government&quot;pledges, are questions which affect oaoh industry differently and on which tho advioo and support of Industrial Couiaails would be invaluable.    The Ministry of Labour is already deriving great assistance from joint representative trade committees on the employment of disabled soldiers and the working of tho Employment $changes.(g) Danger to Consumer.   It is clear from four of the replies that have boen reoeived that national oounoils if established may in some Industries lead to a demand for protection and possibly to attempts to raise prices.one lu si on.Briefly, the recommendation of the vfoitley Report is that the Government should ask the- existing Associations in each industry to organise themselves in suoh; a-way that they oan adjust their difficulties and prepare for the period of reconstruction without troubling the rest of the community, and at the same time give to the workers the opportunity for which they are asking of taking a part in shaping the conditions under whioh they work.   If the Associations do not respond, the recommendations fall to the ground; but in viev of the body of opinion which has been collected, it is very unlikely that an invitation from the Government will meet with refusal.   It will be necessary, however, that the Government should give some indication as to the functions and status of the Oouncils when formed.   It is suggested that it should be decided and announced, as soon as the principle of the Report is adopted,(a) that, the Councils should be asked to take over the large amount of advisory v.rork v/hich is being done at present, and will be necessary i&amp; the future in ^connection with the problems of the War and the transition .to, peace, e.g. recruiting and substitution, control of raw materials, demobilization, employment of disabled . soldiers, conditions of apprenticeship, &amp;o.lb) That the Councils will be recognised as the Official Standing Consultative Committees to the Government on all questions affecting &quot;their respective industries, and will be the- normal ehannel through whioh the opinion and experience of an industry will be sought.(c) That the Councils be asked to undertake the extension,&apos; where necessary,of conciliation machinery with the objeot of deoentralisino: it, and ensuring an opportunity for regular joint consultation in the industry, not only nationally but in each district, and, y/here the Council considers it advisable, In each \7orks.If suoh a definite sphero is assigned to tho Councils there is little fear that the trades which are ripe for it vail decline to avail themselves of the machinery provided.   If authorised
to do so, the Ministry of Labour would select certain industries and approach the Ti-ade Unions and Employers1 Associations in them at once with a view to giving effect to the proposals of the Report-   In the first instance the four trades in which preparations are already far advanced for the formation of Councils (see page &amp;) will probably be selected, and if they prove successful they will pave the way for the formation of Councils in the more difficult industries.The difficulties of giving effect to the proposals of the Report are greatJ but by no means insuperable, if the principle of the Report is sound, viz. that there is in each industry a common interest which needs a special organisation to express itself- and which will be strengthened by giving the opportunity of expression.   It need hardly be pointed out how greatly the problems of Reconstruction will be simplified if in the chief industries of the country there is a regular and thoroughly representative machinery by which difficulties can be adjusted, and through which the opinion and experience of the industries as a whole can be readily obtained by the Government.If, however, the Government proposes to adopt the Report, it is desirable that it should ao so promptly.   The Reports of the Commissions on Industrial Unrest have raised expectations which will easily turn to bitterness if disappointed, and the wide circulation of the Whitley Report has prepared people*s minds for action on the lines which it proposes.   Moreover, the Commissioners support of the Whitley Scheme is based cuito as much on the needs of industry during the War as on the problems which will confront it afterwards.   The Whitley Report provides a great opportunity for reconciling the conflicting, interests which are at present manifesting themselves in so . many directions, and of building up a permanent constitution for the great industries which will enable them to face the difficulties of Reconstruction strong and united, instead of being engaged on internal warfare, which may otherwise be the case when peace comes--MINISTRY 0? LABOUR,&apos;     c- tt R   x-26.9*17
MINISTRY OE LABOUR,Montagu House,)alil be quoted :-Whitehall,ephone Number: Victoria, 8860-3.Treasury, 22i-2.LONDON, S.W.July, 1917.Sir,I am directed by the Minister of Labour to forward the enclosed copy of a report which has been presented to the War Cabinet by the Reconstruction Committee in regard to the relations between Capital and Labour.     This report was drawn up by a Sub-Committee of the Reconstruction Committee mainly composed, as will be seen, of prominent representatives of Employers1 Associations and Trade Unions, and it puts forward certain important proposals for the better regulation of industry, which if carried out will have far-reaching effects on our national welfare.The War Cabinet are deeply concerned that timely and effective measures should be taken to deal with these questions, for they feel that the future of industry, and indeed of the country itself, are closely boimd up with their successful solution.     Moreover, they feel strongly that action cannot be deferred until after the T.7ar, as it is essential that the problems concerning the organisation of industry which peace will bring should be fully and frankly discussed between Employers and Employed before they actually arise.     further, as the trustee for the well-being of all classes of the community the Government itself is vitally interested in the result of these discussions.
As the Sub-Committee states in its report:&quot;In the interests of the community it is vital that after &quot;the .7ar the co-operation of all classes established during &quot;the War should continue, and more especially with regard &quot;to the relations between employers and employed.     For &quot;securing improvement in the latter, it is essential that a &quot;proposals put forward should offer to workpeople the means &quot;of attaining improved conditions of employment and a higher &quot;standard of comfort generally, and involve the enlistment &quot;of their active and continuous co-operation in the promotion &quot;of industry.It is in order to meet these views that the proposals made by the Sub-Committee are framed, and before deciding to adopt them the Government would be glad to have the general views of your organisation upon them.     It should be understood that the proposals are applicable only tc well organised industries, and are intended to deal with only one aspect of the problem cf Industrial reconstructionj .. other aspects requiring other measures remain to be dealt with, but if the fundamental questions affecting the&apos; relations between employers and employed are satisfactorily settled on a permanent basis, the solution of all subsequent difficulties becomes incalculably easier.As the matter is an urgent one, I am to request that you will be so good as to favour the Ministry of labour with the preliminary views of your organisation on the Sub-Committee1&quot;; proposals within one month from this ,date. .   If it is finally/ decided
/deoided to adopt the scheme recommended &quot;by the Suh-Committee, each of the trades affected will he invited to discuss the best method of putting it into operation.     At present the report is only being sent out to the Employers1 Associations and the Trade Unions in the organised industries, in order to get their general criticisms and suggestions.     Specially chosen Officers have been appointed by the Ministry to assist in explaining the scheme.     They will always be glad to give any assistance they can in this direction and. to attend conferences summoned to consider it, either in London or the provinces.     Any communications on this subject should be addressed to ArthurGreenwood, Esq., Ministry of Labour, Montagu House, London, S.W.1. to whom applications for further copies of the report should also be addressed.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,
