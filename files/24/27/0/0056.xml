SECRET.Copy Ko:1 90.1/116/336.War Office,Whitehall, S.W.1,.28th September, 1917.- -L^ Seer e tar y.cl,-$War Cabinet.J;      I forward for the information of the War Cabinet a letter I have to-day received from General Cadorna.     This letter is in amplification of the telegram from General Delme Radcliffe, No. 412, of the 20th September, which has 17*already been circulated to the War Cabinet.I desire to make the following observations on General Cadorna1s letter:-Firstly, as I have already pointed out to the War Cabinet, General Cadorna should have been fully informed of the situation in Russia, which, from a military point of view, has not altered materially during the last three weeks, before the 19th of September when he came to the decision to act on the defensive.   He was also aware before that date of the number of casualties which his previous attacks had cost him, and on the state of his drafts.Secondly, if General Cadoraa&apos;s information that a considerable Austrian force is being transferred from the Eastern front against him were correct, it appears to me that the right military course for him to take was to strike at the enemy before these reinforcements arrived and while he was definitely assured of a considerable superiority both in infantry and in artillery.Thirdly, though we are in regular coimnunication with General Cadornafs Intelligence Department, we have no confirmation of his estimate of the reinforcements which the Austrians have received or are about to receive,.    Only 29 battalions have been definitely identified as having been transferred from the  astern to. the Italian front since the 19th August, though it is probable that 15 more,,making
(Sd.)   W .R. Robertson.C . I. G. S .making a total of 44 battalions, have come over.     There Isno reason to believe that an additional 30 battalions are on their way, but it Is possible that 12 may be.     There are only 8 Austrian Divisions on the Roumanian front which have not been definitely identified since the 1st September, and not 15 as General Cadorna states.      It is calculated that, not more than 6 divisions per month can be railed from the Russian front to the Italian front.     Thus, after taking into account all actual and probable reinforcements which the Austrians may receive, General Oadorna will still have a great- preponderance of force.Lastly, it appears to me that. General Cadorna has; no definite plan of action, but that he Is paralysed by-dismal forebodings of what may happen.     In a very short time the greater part of the Italian front will be closed by snow for military operations on a large scale, and on the remain-der General Cadorna should have no difficulty in assembling a force superior to any which the enemy can at present bring against him.     There- is therefore no reason for leaving with him for defensive purposes guns which are required for offensIve operat ions J
TRANSLATION(Sgd.) CDelme Radcliffe ROYAL ITALIAN ARMY Brig.General.COMANDO SUPREMO,21st September, 1917.Derations &amp; General Affairs Section.To General Sir W. Robertson, G.C.B., Sec.   &amp;c, Chief of the General Staff of the Army ofHis Royal and Imperial Britannic Majesty.Ho. 4511 G.M.SUBJECT:   Present War Situation, SECRET &amp;.PERSONAL.The plan of operations of the Italian Comando Supremo for the offensive; begun on the 18th. August last, included two distinct and successive phases.As the Allied Higher Commands are aware, in the first phase, recently ended, nearly the whole of the enemy&apos;s line on the Carso was broken through; and on the Bainsizza Plateau was effected the capture of a large number,of the enemy&apos;s principal strong points and the disorganisation of his defensive system.In the second phase the Comando Supremo proposed to carry the group of heights which form the Gorizia amphitheatre and to make further progress in the Carsic region, pushing towards the Trstely - Hermada line .For this second phase was organised as formidable a mass of artillery as possible, taking advantage also of the willing assistance lent by our Allies.     Fresh forces &quot;were moved to the Julian front, weakening still further the Trentino front; the pre-parations had been considerably advanced by the date of writing so that the attack might have been made during the first days of October,Naturally
Naturally, in order to develop this second offensive, the Comando Supremo was prepared to face, for the common good of the Allies, diffi-culties even greater than those of the previous onej this, not so much on account of the increase, considerable as it is, already noted in the enemy forces on the Julian front, as on account of the enormous expenditure of ammunition in the first phase, which had greatly depleted the supplies available and on account of the almost complete exhaustion of the drafts in reserve.These two serious difficulties would have been met in the following ways:     as regards ammunition, by drawing on the reserve ear-marked for the needs of prolonged operations on the defensive; as regards personnel, by allowing tho strength of the infantry companies, already reduced from 200 tc 175 men, to fall to 150 men, and by employing certain other measures.     The Italian Comando Supremo would gladly have made these sacrifices and carried thesecond phase of the offensive to its conclusion, for the additional reason of relieving the enemy pressure on the Russian Front and thus facilitating that allied army in its task of reorganising its own resistance.An attempt would thus have been made to inflict on the enemy a fresh blow, equal to the previous one, so as to cripple his fighting power for some months.     During the winter the Comando Supremo would then have proceeded to reorganise the Army and accumulate drafts and ammunition for the 1918 operations.But
But the grave news received in the last few days as to the worsened internal situation in Russia and the disorganisation of the Russian army, now consid-ered irreparable, has altered the situation.   The Italian Comando Supremo has to take into serious consider-ation the possibility of the enemy being able, in a relatively short time, to concentrate fresh forces and new means in considerable quantities on the Italian Front.     Tangible proof of this change in the situation is also in the fact that, to the 60 Austrian battalions already arrived in reinforcement on the Julian front, in a few days will be added another 30 which are fully expected;    at the same time contact has been lost on the Eastern Front with 15 Austrian Divisions, of which a good part may in all probability soon appear in line against   usThese increases of the enemy forces, partly already arrived and partly foreseen, tend to confirm the information persistently received from several sources as to a powerful enemy offensive on the Julian front, the preparations for which are said to be already well advanced.Thus, on the one hand, the increasing strength of the enemy removes the possibility that a heavy blow of ours would be sufficient to check the enemy &apos;s offensive desires and also lessens the probability of a real success, as our superiority in numbers is daily decreasing.     On the other hand, even in the event of a successful attack, there is the possibility of reaching positions too extended and of little defensive value; so that, should the enemy make a counter-offensive on a large scale, we might be obliged to abandon the positionscaptured
captured and retire to others further back which would fulfil the two essential requirements of minimum extension and maximum defensive capability.     All the advantage gained would thus be lost which might have a very serious effect on tho morale of the Army and, above all, on tho power of the country to resist, and would be fraught with incalculable consequences for the Allied cause.To-day,the total Austrian forces on the Italian Front amount to 534 battalions, whilst, during the operations last year in the Trentino, they scarcely reached a total of 509 j with the reinforcements already surely expected, this total will shortly reach 562, tho equivalent (considering that Austrian battalions have four companies of riflemen and Italian battalions only throe and that in machine guns they arc about equal) of 702 of our battalions, whilst the Italian force3 in Italy total 852 battalions.       These reprosont the maximum effort which tho country has been able to make, but they will soon be inevitably reduced as a part of tho brigades of most recent formation will have to be broken up for use as drafts. The Allied Higher Commands are aware that from tho beginning of the May offensive until now, the Italian Comando Supremo has had to supply drafts to replace about 360,000 casualties in action and 360,000 sick, with which the losses of none of the Allied armies this year are to be compared.Under these circumstances, if the Austrian strength on tho Italian Front continues to increase, the forces at the disposal of the Italian Comando Supremo will soon hardly suffice to face a prolonged and powerful enemy offensive.     Nor can it be left out of account that such an offensive may bo made elsewhere than on tho Julian front and possibly also with the assistance of Gorman troops,in view of
hi -$Gin view of the reported arrival of a Bavarian Alpine Corps in the Trent ino sector..The artillery at present available - includ-ing that now furnished by our allies - is certainly not yet sufficient to provide for a defence &quot;A outrance&quot; against   an enemy attack from several directions.     Prom this point of view, it would bo advisable that none of the batteries of tho Allies bo withdrawn from tho Julian front until the situation has become clear.In conclusion, if the Russian situation should bocomo still worse, wo may find oursolvos, oven in this remnant of tho season for operations and certainly in the Spring, faced by an enemy decidedly superior In numbers and animated with the intention of driving his attack homo.Thus, the Italian Comando Supremo, consider-ing that an eventual unsuccessful offensive might have most serious consequences for the Allied cause and  that such a failure would inevitably occur .should the enemyls attack come upon us at a critical moment as regards drafts and ammunition, has had, though to its great- regret-, to decide to suspend the preparations for the proposed rosump-tion of tho offensive, and to provide, instead, for a re-organization of its forces and to arrange for a stout-defence &quot;A outrance&quot; on the whole front, so that nothing arising out of the changed situation in Russia shall find us unprepared, cither now or in the Spring of 1918.The Italian Comando Supremo Is in duty bound to bring the above to the knowledge of the Allied5 Higher Commands.I have forwarded a similar ccmmtunicatioiv fco Gonoral Pooh, Chief of the General Staff of the French Army.(Sd,)   L. Cadorna. Chief of tho General Staff of the Army.
