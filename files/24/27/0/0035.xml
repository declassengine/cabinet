Admiralty *&apos;omcrandum for the War Cabinet^The Board of Adnriralty desire to draw the attention of the war Cabinet to the urgent necessity for the provision of permanent bases for submarines on the North East Coast$The estimated number of oversea submarines that will be in commission by the end of 1918 is 134, and permanent accommodation on the North East Ooast is required for 72 submarines*    Of this numberx accommodation for 48 should be taken in hand at once, and sites at Blyth and on the Tees have been seleoted as being the only two practicable bases south of the Firth of Forth.  .Temporary accommodation for 12 submarines and a parent ship has been established at each of these bases ** both of which are commercial ports - and in drawing up the permanent plans great oare has been taken to interfere as little as possible with their development as suoh. The rough estimate of cost is Blyth        400i000 Tees         200,000. It is considered that the tMrd base, capable of accommodating 24 submarines, should, for strategical reasons, be situated din the Firth of Forth.
