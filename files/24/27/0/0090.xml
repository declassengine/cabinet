loctnmrr is the phopbhty of his britawtio majesty1 s govehmitt.)7.A,jfcR; CABINET. THE AFRICAN SITUATION.(Copy, of telcgram from Lord Northcliffe to Lord Derby.)No. 68. EE&quot;&apos; YORK ,  2S.-S.17.Rec.      29.9.17. 8 p.mNo. 336.Pollowing ia from N0RTHCLIFF3 for DERBY.    Copy to PHILLIPS;-Your letter dated September 5th arrived September 26th. Reference separation allowances, passing of the finance burthen to Canada is unwise and will be used by Canada as bargaining point in our difficult financial relations with her.   BONAR LAW or BEAVERR^: could explain, this,   READING and I are going to Canada October 2nd to discuss finance.. As to French Military influence,  it is obviously increasing&apos; here.   If Prance will not be able to execute enormous orders she is. now receiving from the United States things may shape way you suggest..   France is getting those orders because Americans art., grossly ignorant of what we have done in the war and of excellence of our equipment.Prestnt deplorable attitude here regarding splendid work of our Army and particularly our air (group indecipherable ? forces) due to lack of information.As regards their own achievements, French and Italians flood newspapers of this country.A3 to big man, only big military man who could help here is SrUTS.    r^cLACHLAN seems tactful and understands America but he must have Staff of re 1 experts with him, men who have been at the war.   American Government made thi3 su^estion regarding experts on July Ijfth, Wasbin^ton is full of French officers.   War-Department han complained that thev are not supplied with news of the British Army,, but that they get news of it through French sources.   I shall see   ^acLACKLAN Saturday about this.Notion that Canadians are doing all the fi^tin^ and that we have hu.-;e armies in England still prevails.   This is due to natural desire of Americ to read about Canada,.. to the great supplies of Canada n.e^3,, and to omission to mention names of British regiments.. This last part has now been improved.The continued air. attackson Lonaon and our inability to-hit back convinces America of our air inferiority.   I saw by chance yeitcraay letter from English air machamc in FlandersC R ST. . 2136;
frem which I gathered we are doing immense amount of work that ia quite unknown here.   Hence probably big orders tsw Italian aeroplanes which are making exhibition flights daily here.As to American Air Policy - America cannot 3hip many aeroplanes quickly, but they are undoubtedly training great many men, and their liberty engine is wonderful feat of engineer ing.   Their war preparations generally are far greater than eeem to be known at home.     Japanese have military over here looking about.   Member of Japanese Mission informed Argentine Minister, Washington that the Japanese were amazed at the sisje of America&apos;e preparations.   You will have noticed effect on Argentine Government.If we are doing real work Flanders or elsewhere it should be known here.   Our lack of prestige at Washington is very-hurtful to all our interests, and in my judging it affects financial situation badly,   READING has supremely difficult taekAm cabling this because letters may take 10 days but sometimes exceed 30 days.Hope to return on leave November when I shall be able to give valuable information as to situation here.   Spirit of the people in the great oities is at first astonishing despite German-Irish propaganda.
