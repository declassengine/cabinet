252nA.B.153/35.-    - AIR BOARD. Report to the Cabinet.leneral clicy.US1, The re3ults of the visit of Maj^r^llaArtU^anASir William weir to Paris, referred to in the last Wpoirt^ are as follows:-(a) The American authorities having departed from what was understood to he their agreement to giv* priority in the matter of the supply of silver spruce from America, which is. one of the most vital questions affecting our future supply of aircraft, the following compromise *^as arrived at, at a Conference with Colon?! Boliinr, the Chief American Aviation Officer in. Paris., and the French and Italian Delegates:-   jne briti3h Government are to have 50% of the supply. available for export during October, November and : December, the French Government 30^-, with a maximum of 5,000,000 feet and the Italian Government 20/j with any surplus beyond the 5,000,000 feet allotted to the French. Colonel Boiling has cabled his opinion to the American Aircraft Production Board that the requirements of the U.S.A. sbould be subordinated to tho39 of the Allies.(b) The present French aviation authorities hold . strongly the view that all orders for enp-ines to. be manufactured in France should be placed through them.    Hitherto the British Government has placed its contracts direct, but it is impossible to bppose the wish of the French Government seeing that we have adopted the sam9 attitude as rsgards French orders in this Country.   The French Government has agreed to allot the whole of the&apos; output of Messrs. Clerget to us and an order for 1,000 200 h.p. Clerget engines has been placed with that firm, this engine having now been approved for production by both the French Government and our experts.(c) The French Government has promised us 750 110 h.p. Le lihone engines before the end of the year, these engines being urgently required for training machines.     Ve are also to. have immediately 150 Hispano-Suiza engines out of the available stock.(d) Messrs.  &quot;ayen, with whom we have a contract for 1600 engines, the type of which .has remained up till now unsettled,&quot;pending the development of a high-powered engine, are to manufacture 300 h.p. Hispano-Suiza engines, also a new engine recently approved for production.     The French are to have a proportion of the number to be manufactured, which has not yet been finally settled.
2. Th* Russian Government have on orderin France, under joint contracts placed &quot;by the British Government, 3500 Kispano-Suiza engines. In view of the present situation, it is thought that these engines should be retained and used by us.3. It has been decided to create additionalfacilities for the manufacture of Kandley-Page machines, sufficient to secure an output of an additional 100 a month, which is the maximum which it is thought likely that we shall be able to handle.     The first supply of the new type of this powerful bomber is expected in February next and will gradually increase until an output of 200 a.month is reached in June 1918.In this connection it is interesting to note that the American Government has obecidsd to build 1000 Kandley Pap;e machines.4, The Board have directed General Cormack,their representative in Washington, to ascertain from the American Aircraft. Production Board whether t3iey would allow the manufacturing facilities of Kr. Henry Ford to be placed at the Board&apos;s disposal.     This is in accordance with a suggestion made to the Board by Mr, Ford himself.     If the proposal were approved, Mr. X:&apos;ord would probably be asked to manufacture .   Plat engines and D.H.2 aeroplanes, these supplies being looked upon as a supplement to the regular programme. -5, The Board feel considerable concernabout the production or&quot; aerial bombs.     The number of bombs estimated to be required has been communicated to the liiniatry of Munitions, but xhe trench Warfare Department declare themselves unable to supply the steel Tor the purpose.     A question of priority is involved, which forms part of the general question now before General Smuts&apos; Coraiv.ittee on Aerial Operations.Supply. 6.
