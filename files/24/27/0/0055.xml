SECRET.Intelligence Bureau,WEEKLY REPORT ON FRANCE. XII.Department of Information.FFtf/012.(September 27, 1917).The information received since last Thursday all tends to confirm the general impression that the Painleve Ministry has had a rather cool reception and has its position to make both in the Chamber and the country.   M. Painlev&amp; is nervous in the Tribune and a hesitating speaker.   The success of his speeches as Minister of War, when he had definite and on the whole popular things to say, carried with it no promise of success in the much more difficult task of appearing as Prime Minister and making such a declaration of policy as would unite the whole Chamber in support of the Government.     In this he failed last week and the oratorical success of the day belonged to M. Ribot who again showed how entirely at home he is in the Tribune and how valuable such gifts of speech as his are in a country governed as France is.   The immediate and visible result was probably not the most important. Li, Rioot may or may not have been the means of preventing any votes being recorded against the Government in the division (the one vote reported last week disappeared on a recount):   but it certainly managed to create a more favourable atmosphere in the Extreme Left and Socialist quarters than couldjhave been expected, from the hostility displayed towards him personally during the crisis.     His restatement of the war-aims of France contained nothing very new but was admirably worded so as to gratify the Socialists without offending anyone else.     It was received with great and practically universal applause by the Chamber;   and even the Press next day, though ,not under the spellf the orator:s presence, showed that voices usually discordant
-   -/could.agree in praising what M. Ribot had said.    Of course the ; Socialists were delighted at the Minister!s repudiation of a peace ] of vengeance, and of such indemnities as are of the nature of fines er penalties, at his declaration that the true and necessary guaran-tee of peace will he found when the will of the German people is he-hind the signature of its Government and at his demand to knew whether Germany accepted the Sooiety of nations?    Other parties were oen-ciliated hy his demand for Alsace-Lorraine as a Bimple act of jus-Itioo and his energetic repudiation of .the polioy of walking into a German trap.    Perhaps the most notable proof of his success was not the satisfaction of the Humanit^but the fact $hat the Debate   has been led by his remarks about the non-publioation of the Russian treaty and by the general line he took up to declare that all secret treaties should be null and void till submitted to the peoples who are to be bound by them.It is evident that M. Ribot lilte M. Painleve set himself to win back the Socialists if possible, and at any rate not to embitter them, in spite of their refusal to Join the present Ministry,    M. Painlev^s declaration talked of the Sooiety of Nations, and the use of the aotual phrase, whioh has been made into a kind of fetish, is a powerful weapon with people like the Socialists, who so easily believe that a phrase is the same thing as its application.   It alse promised Governmental and Parliamentary control of the Army and a loyal application of the recently introduced reforms giving the men a share in the control oi^fco workshops.    Its whole tone, in fact, made an appeal to the Left, and a further appeal was made by the speeches betb of the Prime Minister and of M. Ribot, the first of whom said that his internal policy far frem being one of repression would in faot be that of K. Malvy:   which the latter in reply to an interruption emphatically declared that M. Malvxnad done his duty.
/   i   &quot;jw u dThese are large, perhaps dangerous, concessions, to the spirit of the Extreme Left, and, though the Human!te talks of the &apos;faiblesse generale&apos; of the Cabinet and is particularly angry   at I&apos;i Painleve^s hints at enforcing the decisions of the Censor by penalties, there are several signs that the policy of conciliation mpy be successful. It is true that the immediate success, as tested by the division was not particularly striking.     F(br, if no votes were recorded against the Government, there were as many as 130 abstentions which is clear evidence that the Union Sacree is no lowger in existence, or at any rate no longer involves active supoort of the Government but only abstention from opposition.     All the Socialists abstained, the party discipline bringing into line not only all the more patriotic section who would have liked to vote with the Government but even the two or three Zimmerwaldian extremists who have opposed previous votes of confidence.     Among the abstainers were asajo   24 of the 130 Radical-Socialists, and among them M. Caillaux, a result which shows that so far this imnottant party, contrary to some proohecies,, adheres to those of its leaders who have taken office and not to M.I Caillaux or to his candidate for the Ministry of the Interior, M. Ren/ Renoult,     Seven of the party called Republican Socialists als  abstained, among them being M. Augagneur who held office under Briand and VL. Violette the late Minister of Supplies.   II, Viviani,. who was Prime   Minister at the beginning, of the war and an important member of ii. RibotTs Cabinet, interrupted M. Rihot to insist on his defending M, Halvy, but he voted with the Government, as didrjit . Briand.But though the immediate success was at any rate no more than , partial several well-informed observers, among them Lord Bertie, believe that this conciliatory attitude has had its effect and that [not only will many of the more moderate Socialists in future vote pith the Government but that one or more of them will after all join
the Ministry.     M. Thomas has just publicly declared, that he is in favourof joining on conditions.     It seems Tggikely however that this willoccur before the Bordeaux Socialist   Conference, to which allusionwas made last week, has been got out of the way.     But if a definitesplit between the moderate and extremist parties takes nlace there,the moderate men headed by Thomas would probably rally to M. PeinleveT.Ihcif self-interest as well as their patriotism, which no one doubts,may urge them to do so:   for if, as seems likely, the refusal to joinU, Ribot and M. Painlevdf was in part inspired by a belief that theSocialists , and in particular M. Thomas, could dictate their ownterms, the result may have taught them all a lesson of modesty.Another reason given for their refusal would suggest a long delay.    Itis said that some of them possess information about the various&quot;affaires&quot; involving treason, suspicions of 7/hich are now agitating theFrench public, and would prefer to have them cleared up by others before(they themselves take the responsibility of office.These affairs continue to fill the newspapers, but nothing verydefinite has happened about them, except that, as anticipated, and athis own request M. Turmel, the accused Deputy, has been placed by theevidentlyChamber at the disposition of the law.     He is/a financial adventurer of the worst type, who suddenly rose from poverty to wealth last year; and his attempts to explain his various transactions seem to be at once refuted by the patties concerned.     But the weakness of the actual evidence produced against him by the Public Prosecutor struck not only the CQmmittee of the Chamber but such a paper as Le Matin, which holds no brief for him or his party.     The &quot;Bole affaire&quot; in which another adventurer of a still shadier sort is suspected of having received three very large cheques, nominally from the Ex-Khedive,, really from the German Government, may prove more serious in its results. For it may involve M, Poincare,     It is believed that he is the person
9 3 7&quot;qualified by his nature and by the importance of his high position&apos; who guaranteed Bolo&apos;s respectability to 11, Humbert the Kditor of LeJournal who, on this recommendation, accepted from him a capital sum of 5,000,000 francs for his paper, though expressly on the under-standing that he exercised no influence over its policy as in fact, according to 11, Humbert, he has not done.     Lord Bertie thinks that it is due   to M. Poincare^s interference that though Suspected for 7 months and eubjoct to domiciliary visits from officers charged with enquiry into the affair he is still at the Grand Hotel and has not actually been arrested.     Obviously there are dangers here.Keanwhile, apart from such danger, the new Ministry has clearly not yet settled firmly into the saddle, and it cannot be said to be certain that it will ever do so.     In constitution it is somewhat more Conservative than the last, though the -personal change from M. Ribot to M. P&amp;mnleve&apos; is in the opposite direction.     But M. Painleve&apos;, though a strong Radical himself, has been prevented from having any Socialist colleagues, and, though he has included no actual member of the Right, has brought in such Conservative   Republicans as M.Barthou, H. Doumer and M. Lupuy as Ministers without Portfolio, acdeparture much attained by U, Caillaux who sent   emissaries to M. Painleve to pretest against it, really with a view to getting rid of H. Barthou against whom he has a speoial enmity for reasons given last week .     He also tried to get the Ministry of the Interior for 11. Rene Renoult probably because he hates M. Steeg who, though a rather violent anti-clerical, is said to be a very honest man, a quality particularly needed at the Interior;   he is a personal friend both cf the Prime Minister and M. ?oincare*,     Mother ucraber of the new Cabinet much detested by M. Caillaux is M. Franklin Bouillon who has been appointed Minister of foreign Missions.   His appointment is not yet officially gazetted perhaps because he is in America at present.t
He is an intimate friend of M. Painleve&apos; , a bitter enemy of Caillaux and a man of quarrelsome but very energetic character who may play a very important part in the future.     It may be noted that he is on verjp- good terms with M. Briand during whose Premiership he exercised a good deal of influence.     M. Caillaux&apos;s friends in the Pays are attacking this particular enemy through his office which is new and, they say, will establish a kind of double foreign Office which will have the worst results.     What is really wanted, they urge, is to democratise and laicize the whole system of French fepresentation abroad.     Meanwhile they urge M. Painlevl&apos; to withdraw the appointment, but so far in all these three cases the Prime Minister has preferred to set M. Caillaux at defiance.     And the appointment of M.  lotz to the Ministry of Finanee was another act not calculated to gratify the Caillaux faction, from which M. Klotz has for some years drawn decidedly apart.On the whole the new Cabinet is very much like the last, but it is somewhat more Conservative end it contains more men of energyand ability.     MM. Barthou, Doumer, Klotz, Steeg are all acquisitions of strength.     IL Loucheur, who is not in Parliament but collaborated of late with M. Thomas whom he succeeds a3 Minister of Munitions, is a big manufacturer with: a reputation for ability.   He has made a good impression during the last few months: but of course he canaot have the influence M. Thomas has over the working classes.     The absence of the latter is the chief weakness of the new Ministry as compared with its predecessor.     Another may prove to be K. Painleve^s lack cf oratorical power.     &quot;hen the Chamber gets excited and a critical division is im-pending orators like M. Ribot and K. Viviani c?;n often save the situation in a way that will not be possible for M. Painleve.     On the other hand he is young for a politician, (born in 1863) and a man of very remarkable ability proved before and after he entered politics, as well as of the
strictest integrity and highest character.     If he can always show the same decision and firmness as he showed in solving the ctisis of the High Command after the failure of the April offensive, he may easily acquire a much stronger position as Prime Minister than his oratorical defects have allowed him to obtain at his first appearance.     He showed loyalty both to his former uhief and probably also to the Allies in re-sisting the Socialist attempt to get rid of M. Ribot, which might have had a bad effect not only in France but abroas.     And he has to his credit his successful career at the Ministry of War where indeed he still remains.Another thing which should be an element/strength to him is the im-proved moral of the nation.      He was able in his speech to challenge anyone to compare the tone of the army five months ago with its tone of to-day, and to claim tha change as a piece of good work accomplished. There is no doubt that a bad spirit prevailed after the offensive -officers were assaulted, and the moral of part of the army was badly shaken.     But since then discipline has been restored and with   it the &quot;moral&apos; and confidence which have enabled General Petain to renew the offensive at Verdun.     Evidence accumulates that the same improvement, aa mentioned last week, has taken place in the country.     Lord Bertie says that the &apos;neurasthenic mood1 of April has given place to a &quot;determined feeling&apos; as to the Necessity of seeing the war through to the bitter end&apos;.     Observers more closely in touch with the working-classes report the same thing.     Suspicions as they may be of,the pro-ertied classes and of anything approaching reaction, bent as they are on an advanced social and economic policy after the v/ar, they are in no watj anxious to stop the war,     One who has worked among them for 15 years when asked about their pacifist tendency simply replied &quot;no such tendency exists&quot;.     Another who talked to a number osi secretaries of working-class organisations found that all but one agreed with M.
Thomas in demanding a more vigorous conduct of the war and in not raising the question of an International Socialist Conference at all in his recent negotiations as to entering the Ministry.     Many of the workmen have discovered what is obviously the case, that the continuance cf thejwar pitbs labour in a very strong ppsition for enforcing demands which could not be successfully risked in peace time.On the wholei then, the difficulties before the Government are quite e.s likely to be Internal as external.     The Ministry have always .ito be on their guard against some sudden wave of suspicion such as might be worked up if they appeared to use the present prosecutions as a pollti-cal weapon against the Left.     Apart f&amp;om this their more awkward prob-lems appear to be two.     The first is that of civilian control of the army whioh is incessantly demanded by the press of the Extreme Left, has been promised by the Prime Minister, is said to be very unwelcome to the High Command, and very likely to prove unworkable or mischievous.     And with Russia in the state she is any tampering with the control cfjthe army by its own officers cannot but arouse grave anxiety in many quar-ters which cannot be accused of reactionary sentiments.The second is the awkward matter of the constantly repeated demand for a considerable extension of the British front so as to enable a large number of French soldiers to be sent back from the colours.    This is expected to be carried out as soon as the offensive is over.     The French never put this demand re^onably, never admit in public the &quot;vital nart we have played from the very first or the sacrifices we have made, perhaps do not even know that the 3ritish Itfavy played quite as important a part in the defence of Paris as the French army, certainly never ask themselves whether their army would ever dream of taking the principal part if it were England and not France that were invaded. But, for all that they have a case, and it was put very effectively in the Chamber on the 19th by M. Llmery, a colonial deputy, who was very
J . C . B amuch applauded.     He is no pacifist and &quot;began by a denunciation of Stockholm and Rome.     But the rest of his speech was an insistence of the continuity of army and nation which he declared could not be separated.    The army, he argued, must not be thought of independently.-men must be sent where they are most urgently needed.     From this point of view he maintained that a deficient harvest was more dangerous than a local defeat at tho front, and asked how many week1s food supply the late Verdun offensive has cost the country.     ^nd he demanded the return of 300,000 men to the farm and the workshop.     M. Painleve&quot;&apos; could only renly that the solution of this difficulty did not rest with France alone, but that what she had done gave her a right to ask the help of her allies.     Ho doubt the good-will of the Allies will find a way out of vhat is at once a military difficulty for Prance *uid ; politic- 1 difficulty for the Ministry.     But the task would be eisier if the French were more generous in recognising such assistance.
