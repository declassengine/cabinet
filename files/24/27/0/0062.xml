Colonel Jones!THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;&apos;3 GOVERNMENT ,),SE CP E TY/AR CABINET.INCREASE IN MINERS1 WAGES.?1?I desire to record my regret that I was not given an opportunity of being heard on the question of the increase of Coal Miners&apos; wages before a decision y/as come to by the War Cabinet.It may have been oonsidered that the question was purely one of finance and that consequently my Department xvas not con-cerned, but on looking below the surface it will be realised that a concession such as that agreed to by the War Cabinet, whether in respect of increased wages or other demands made by labour, must seriously prejudice the availability of man-power for all national purposes.A. C. GEDDES.29th September, 1917. N.S.R.14.
