Col, Jones(This Document is the Property of&apos;f% His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)\ \n..../H k \*\ 9 fillADMIRALTY MEMORANDUMresulting from recent discussion with U.S. Naval Offioers as to the form of future Naval assistance desired from United States of America.The further assistance desired from the United States from available forces or resources is as follows:-(1)   Four coal-burning battleships of the &quot;DREADNOUGHT&quot; type to replace 3 or 4 Grand Fleet wDREADNOUGHT83 battleships which it is desired to send to fersign waters to relieve older battleships which are being paid off for want of personnel,(2)   An increase in the number of destroyers, in order to enlarge the convoy system and to provide better protection for each convoy.(3)   An increase in the number of convoy cruisers for the same reason.(4)   An increase in the number of patrol oraft, tugs, etc, for anti-submarine work.(5)   The rapid building of merchant ships.(6)   The supply of a large number of mines for theproposed barrage in the North Sea and assistance towards laying them by the provision of United States minelaying vessels,(7)   Aircraft assistance.As regards (1), the increase in the number of destroyers during the war has forced us to pay off the older capital ships to provide trained personnel for the light cruisers, flotilla loaders and destroyers.    This policy must still oontinue, as officers and crews will be required during the next 18 months for the 19 light cruisers, 12 flotilla leaders and 119 destroyers now in various stages of construction.Should the U.S. Government see fit to send over 4 coal burning &quot;Dreadnoughts&quot;, they would be attached to the Grand Fleet and form an integral portion of it, working together as a Division of a Battle Squadron.(2)
?i P 4(2)i    Tho United States destroyers are more suitable for convoy wcrk on the western approaches to Great Britain than British destroyers, owing to their size and greater radius of action.    Any increase possible in this direction would enable more British destroyers to be used in the North Sea tfl operate offensively against enemy submarines.     The total additional requirements are 55 destroyers for convoy work alone,(3)    An increase in the number of convoy cruisers would enable the number of convoys to be increased, or, alternatively the number of merchant ships in each convoy could be reduced and better control and protection be assured.     The total additional requirements of convoying vessels (Cruisers or old Battleships) are 41,(4)    The proposed barrage of mines in the North Sea willentail the provision of large numbers of patrol vessels. Anyassistance from the United States in this respect will bemost welcome, either to oo-operate in patrolling the barrage,or, alternatively, to release British patrol vessels for thispurpose.    The total requirements for this purpose are48 destroyers or sloops 128 trawlers80 motor launches (110 feet) 20 tugs,(6)    At least 100,000 mines are required for the Barrage, in addition to the 100,000 British mines that will be used.(7)     Complete materiel and personnel for 3 large seaplane stations on the Coast of Ireland;   not less than 36 machines at each station.1 Staff,27th September 1017.
