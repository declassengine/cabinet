S B C R B I.From Colonel Spiers,Liaison Officer, Paris.21st September 1917,To   : War Office for Colonel Fagalde. 817.Following from Italian G.H.Q. September 21st 1917, Chief of French Mission was informed by General PQRRO that Italian High Command had given up all intention of offensive on 2nd and 3rd Army fronts.     Reasons, anxiety as regards Russians; interior situation of Italy.General PORRO said &quot;Objectives would cost 2,000,000 shells and 150,000 men and success would be far from certain. Resumption of offensive in the Spring would be prevented by this expenditure; men would be lacking to re-form units; nor would the 5,000,000 necessary shells be available, even relying on a monthly production of 650,000 shells which oould be attained only if sufficient coal is available.   We should therefore be weakened at moment when the Central Powers most likely to strengthen their front and assume counter-offensive. Arrival of 6 German divisions is announced by reliable report from Stockholm.   As the morale of tho country is giving some anxiety, Italy cannot run risk of a failure at beginning of Winter&quot;.General Gondrecourt protested and said transport of French artillery was in the. circumstances a disaster,   Porro replied that a failure would be still more serious for the country.     On all subjects Porro was very pessimistic. Pessimism at Italian G.H.Q. is largely due to Mr.BISSOLATI.
