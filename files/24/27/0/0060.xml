p-----m isTM PBOPTOTY OF HIS BRITATOC MA.TBBTY&apos;8 GOVERHIBOT     6053SECRET. vQ, T. -2160 WAR,    0, A B I NET.SUPPLY OP COAL FOR ITALY FROM THE TOI^TET^EZIITGDOM^ Memorandum by the Ministry of Shipping.1, The average shipments of coal from the United kingdom toItaly during the 7 months. January to July inclusive, were 403,464 tons. Of this quality162,168 tons were shipped in British vessels under British control.105* 655 tons     &quot;        &quot; &quot;        &quot; &quot; !&apos;   Italian      &quot;135,641 tons    &quot;        &quot; M   Italian or Neutral vessels under i Italian control,403,464 tons2. Temporary emergency assistance has been given to Italyduring August and September.   This has been possible, partly as a result of the failure in wheat shipments in America and partly by a temporary depletion of other services,    (In both cases the result must be to increase the demands on tonnage in the immediate future)The result of this extra assistance was that in August 326,463 tons were shipped in British vessels under British control, 137,412 tons in British vessels under Italian control and 226,601 tons in Italian and Neutral vessels under Italian control. 68970*5*4 tons.   ..       w&amp;g at the same time indicated that if possible theshipments in September would be kept,up to a figure which wouldgive an average of 600,000 tons shipments from the. UnitedKingdom for the two months, August and September.     On thebest estimate that can be formed this will be realised, about513,000 tons (289,000 in British vessels and 224,000.in Italianand Neutrals) being shipped in September, making an averageof slightly over 600,000 tons for the two months, but theprecise figure must of course depend upon the shipments of the next few days.
These figures are exclusive of shipments from America. The Italian representatives put arrivals from this source at 25,000 tons a month, but the American export statistics shew exports of from 50,000 to 70,000 tone for certain months.On the other hand the kbove figures are-- cf shipments not arrivals, i.e. there is no deduction for losses en. route -It will.thus be seen that the average shipments in British tonnage of all kinds amounted to 2.6 7,-000 tons for the 7 months January to July or a little under 300,000 for the 9 months January to September including the emergency assistance in the last 2 months.There is at present a shortage of ships for all the main British requirements.   During the next 3 weeks for instance&apos;the different supply Departments-are asking for 80 ships more than we can provide (even though these demands are based Upon re-quirements reduced through the Tonnage Priority Committee etc)It seems clearly therefore unsafe to hold out any pros-pect   of shipping more than. 300,000 tons a month at the outside&apos; in British tonnage .(including British tonnage under Italian control).This wouldmean shipments of over 500,000 tons a month if the Italians can keep up their neutral and Italian ship-ments to their August - September figure, in addition to ship-men t a from,America.Italy should probably have 150,000 tone,more than this (allowing on the one hand for some reduction from her stated requirements and on the other/hand-for some losses en route). This would give her a total of shipments (without allowance for losses ) of between 650,000 and 700,000 ton3 a month-
3 *J3V **As regards this extra tonnage the enly course appears to be for the Italians to ask for the tonnage (not the coal) from America. We cannot continue to bear our present Allied obligations, much less extend them. ,..In the circumstances it is proposed to suggest to the Italians that they should make an appeal to America endorsed by us.   To save tonnage the proposal should be on the basis of America sending what ships she can on a triangular voyage America - United Kingdom, United Kingdom - Italy, as?4 then out with pyrites to the United States of America, Great Britain putting in an extra collier to Italy for every cargo delivered in the United Kingdom under the arrangement,  so that each round voyage by an American ship would mean&apos;2 cargoes to Italy and one to the United States of America.The only objection to this course would appear to be the possible effect upon American action with regard to our ships building in America.   But it does not seem practicable to wait further on this account.On the other hand there is the great advantage of making America feel the Allied burden as her own. and have some inducement to comb out her own trade now and before the actual necessity arises for her own shipments in the spring.It would appear desirable to deal similarly with future increased demands by the Allies for really essential imports (wheat for instance^  for which Italy will certainly be soon making a renewed appeal)*If this policy is approved the Italians will be invited to confer With the.Ministry of Shipping with a,view to agreeing the form of the oommunications to America.27th September,  1917..
