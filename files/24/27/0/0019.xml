/7 \ j -.1 have had again under consideration the future supply of beer.fi. maximum permitted barrelage under the Intoxicatinp&apos;Biqw (output and Delivery) Order, No.2, 1917, is at therate of 10,700,000 standard barrels per annum with an1 .addition of 33^/5 for the quarter ending September 30th, besides the 750,000 standard barrels per annum for Navyand Array purposes.Of the 33*$ Increased barrelage permitted for * the current, quarter 13g$ is held at the disposal of the Pood Controller for consumption in Inanition areas and to provide harvest beer, and 20% is distributed in the-manner prescribed by the Output of Beer (Restriction) Act 1916*A braver&apos; electing to brew the increased barrelage is required to brew half the total barrelage permitted for his brewery at an average original gravity not exceeding the average original gravity cf the total heer brewed at the brewery during - tv-o corresponding quarter of 1916, and the other half must be brewed and delivered at an original gravity not exceeding 1036?oVery little, If any, of the 33^ increased barrelage was available for the Public before August with the result that this Increased amount will all have been consumed during the last two months of the quarter.On October 1st,, the permitted barrelage reverts to the rate of 10,700,,000 standard barrels per annum plus Navy and Array requirements, and owing to the relatively liberal supply of beer available for the Public during August and September the falling off in October will   -be very marked.
I am most anxious to conserve in every way possible the supplies of all cereals that may be m&amp;e available for human food and the Royal Commission on T7heat Supplies: are naturally averse to any increase In the permitted barrelagt. At the same time I recognise that political considerations j cannot be disregarded and I am aware that some of theindustrial unrest is due to the smaller quantity of beerf &apos; &apos;M available.   The Government Is blamed not only for thef I &apos;   i -[IH shortage but for the quality and the price of beer.I have been forced to the conclusion that it would be inadvisable to laake any marked reduction in the quantity of beer available next month.    I fear that if we wait until the pressure of public opinion ie: exercised it may be found necessary to concede an even larger increase than that allowed for the present quarter, vhile delays In coming to a decision would tend to dieorganise the trade.I recommend, therefore, that the &apos;7ar Cabinet sanction for another quarter the 33^.^ increase in the- standard barrelage already permitted for the curront- quarter* though I do so with reluctance^.Unless the Cabinet is. prepared to assume complete control of the brewing industry, the gravity and the price of all beer cannot he regulated, but, -2^ my suggestion, for an increased allowance is accepted, conditions should \   be imposed which would secure that (1) no beer atoa^l be designated &quot;Government Ale&quot; that is not of  air c^lity, and (2) &amp; ^xiiiiuiii price be fixed for the rotai,! sale of a;   considerable proportion of the total permitted barrelage.i &apos; .   , - &apos; .&apos;\  I feel strongly that the Government should not allow the 4 present high prices to continue entirely uncontrolled.,Ministry of Food.
