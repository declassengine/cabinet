(Memorandum by the Chairman.)



---------------------------------



The War Cabinet, at their Meeting on September 21st, 1917, (War Cabinet 237, Minute 6) decided that a Committee composed as under :



General Smits (Chairman)

Sir Eric Goddes.

Lord Derby.

Mr. Churchill.

Lord Cowdray.

Major L. Storr (Secretary)



should be assembled at once in order to enquire at the earliest date into the conditions that prevail in regard to the output of aircraft in this country and to report to the War Cabinet as soon as possible on the whole situation, giving their recommendations as to priority and the effect that any priority, if granted, would have on the output of the Army and Navy and in what direction.

I append below an extract from the Minutes of the First Meeting of the Committee held on September 26th, 1917, which gives the Committee&apos;s recommendation -



The COMMITTEE took note of Mr. Churchill&apos;s statement that, so far as he could judge at present, his Department would be able to complete the air programme without prejudice to the munitions&apos; programmes of the Admiralty and War Office for the coming year, provided that sufficient raw material of all kinds and the necessary labour were forthcoming.



The COMMITTEE were of opinion, as the result of their discussion, that they could not usefully perform the functions allotted to them if they were not constituted as an ad hoc body but became a standing Committee which would, as occasion might necessitate, have preliminary


cj ej ?idiscussions on. any controversial points that might arise between the Departments concerned, and settle arl questions of priority, in regard to the com-pletiou of the present air and other programmes, and the extent to which the requirements of the other Departments, might be affected thereby, all questions not susceptible of solution by the Committee, being referred to the Wat Cabinet for final decision.The COI&amp;IITM decided. :-To report to the War Cabinet, in the above sense.I would invite the particular attention of my colleagues to the fact that the Committee recommend that they should be empowered to settle all questions: of priority not only of the present air programme but of all other munitions programmes.   If the War Cabinet decide to sanction this recommendation, I would suggest that the title of the Committtee be altered-from &quot;Aerial Operations Committee&quot; to &quot;War Priorities Committee&quot;.(Initialled) C, S.Z, Whitehall Gardens,   S.W.1st October, 1917..
