p,H.3 * &amp;86 **i o rtSept. 21 - 27, 1917.BLOCKADE tBBQAiil^AflOII.     The United states  sports Board arewilling to adopt the British aystem of controlling coal, exports, so far as exports to Europe and South America are concerned, and to supply us regularly ?/ith information as to the licences granted and the experts which lire actually effected,   The importance of this decision can hardly be exaggerated.   Owing to the present shortage of coal for home consumption the United States Fuel Controller has decided that exports to lurope and South America must be reduced to a minimum.&apos; We have proposed to the $ranch Government the establishment in London of a Blockade Council composed of representatives of Great Britain, France find the United States.   The function of the Council would be to deliberate on questions of general policy;   but it would naturally be left for the several Allied Governments to decide in what manner each will give effect to the recommendations of the Council,   &apos;ihe Ifreneh Government have readily accepted the proposal, and it will now be submitted to the State Department at Washington by the British and French ambassa-dors.     They will explain that the Blockade Council is not intended to meddle in the control of exports from the United states, and that Itondon is the natural centre from which this Allies should control the trade of the Europe an, neutrals,&apos;    *m B(jLiTd&apos; BM UKUTwOS.    The policy of the United States Exports Board towards tho northern neutrals is now provisionallydefined. For the present these countries are not to receive American goods, except in so far as special bargains to meet
special emergencies may toe thought advisable.   But this decision will not be publicly or privately comrauni-e&amp;ted to those whom it affects.   2hey are to be kept in suspense while they are consuming their homo produce and such reserves of imported goods as they still possess. So long m they have any hope of obtaining supplies froa the United States, it is improbable that they will allow themselves to be drawn into more intimate relations vdt&amp; So rmany.Denmark and Holland are in a comparatively strong position as to food-supplies,    hey oan exist, though not in comfort, on their own meat sad grain and dairy produce. In respect of coal supplies they are more vulnerable; but it ie not proposed to reduce them to absolute dependence upon Germany for coal4 which she could still supply in sufficient quantities if a sufficiently attractive equi-valent could be wrung out of her neutral customers.   We have offered the Danes an additional 60.000 tons of coal a month, on condition of receiving a larger quantity of Danish merchant shipping on better terms than we obtained under the original Anglo-Danish shipping agreement,   as for the Xruteh, since it appears that they have repented of the quasi-ultima turn which they delivered last week and no longer insist upon receiving specific quantities of grain from the united States, we have anticipated the con-clusion of the Anglo-Dutch Coal and Shipping Agreement to the extent of placing 100,000 tons of coal immediately at their disposal,   This favour should enable them to pro-long i&amp;eir coal negotiations with Germany;   and it appears certain that Germany will considerably abate her terms if that is the only way of obtaining Butch credits in the course of the nest few weeks.
To itortsay and Sweden tha united states have made exceptional and unwelcome concessions in respect of grain supplies.   Within a short time lorwsy ^ill receive over  6,000 tons of American rye and barley and 10,000 tons of flour.   Thiese supplies, added to mr present stocks, will enable the xtorwogian Government to continue a policy of passive resistance for at least six months, inuring that period Norway will have it in her power to supply our enemies with about gOQ,OQG tons of fish, fish-oil, and other valuable products vyhieh we cannot afford to buy.   awe den Is not so highly favoured, and is only to receive 7,000 tons of American rye.    heso shipments have been licensed In order to obtain tfce retrocession of largest stocks which wer^ held in the United Btatea for the account of the Swedish and Norwegian Governments.   But it is regrettable that the object in view has not been secured at a smaller price.Mr. Wilson aeeras to be of the opinion that we must not press Norway too hard unless we &amp;re prepared to under-take tho responsibility of defending her against attack. But on this point he has reserved his decision.   In tho me entire the action of his Government has confirmed the $oraegians in their habitual optimism.   It seems useless under the present circuinstances for H.M. Government to take any drastic action with regard to our Norwegian Agreements.-   A report has been received that the Eussisn Government propose to supply Sweden with 60,000 tons of oilcake in exchange for 3,000 tons of aieat.   Sir George Buchanan is enquiring into the truth of this report,   if It is sub-stantiated he will make strong representations to the Eussi&amp;n Government regarding this policy of exchanges with
^ 3 t)a country whieh the Allies are endeavouring to starve into a more correct neutrality.   At present Sweden shows no signs of any Inclination to reconsider the question of her iron-ore shorts.   Sir Mm Howard states that, even if a Socialist Government came into power as the resoIt of the general election, iron-ore would still go to Germany as at present,SffAIff,      Taz new ^&amp;lo-Spanish agreement has been accepted by the Spanish Government, but we shall consult the United States before we ratify it.   Under the agreement Spain will bo entitled to her normal requirements of British coal, pro-vi&amp;ed that she sends Spanish ships to fetch the coal.   The Spanish $overuseat on their side will give undertakings to prohibit the export of coal from Spain, and not to impede the export of Spanish ores, metals ma minerals to the United Kingdom.SWIT^BIiltABD.   The United states imports Board have licenced the export of 6^000 tone of oil cake to Switzerland and have promised licences for another 84,000 tons as soon aa that quantity are available.   The Swiss Minister at Washington expresses himself as entirely satisfied with this arrsnge-msnt and further exports of Swiss cattle to Oermany sxe therefore prevented for the time being.The federal Oovernment have not yet acceded to our demand that they should, establish en effective control over the export of munitions to the Central Empires.   Sir H. Rumbold has addressed a remonstrance on this subject to the Swiss Minister for Foreign Affairs,It appears that the Swiss harvest end the present stocks of foodstuffs in Switzerland are sufficient to main-
2265.tain tho population for nine months.   Under these cireum-stances the Allies can scarcely hope to enforce a total cessation of Swiss exports of aluminium, calcium carbide and ferro-chrome to Germany.      If the Allies made the attempt they would endanger the continuance of swiss supplies to France which are probably as important as those received by Germany; and there would be the further risk of driving the iiwiss into a closer economic alliance with Germany.   For the present the View of the United States Export Board is that Switzerland should not be made the subject of exceptional measures, in view ox the special difficulties of her position and of her position as a pur-veyor to the Allies.   *hia is also the view of E*M*Minister at Berne.   If overseas supplies arc withheld, as at present, the difficulties of Switzerland are bound to increase;   and when tho federal Government apply for assistance, it should be possible to impose further restrictions on the export trade to Germany.fi?he Chocolate Agreement with the Allies was ratified by the federal Council on September 17.B. PUAOHASK SQ1&amp;M&amp;S.   Sir 0. Spring i\ioe understands that the United States Government are not disposed to participate in the financial liabilities of our scheme for purchasing Italian oranges and lemons.   2hey have reserved their decision respecting the scheme for purchasing the exportable surplus of Argentine cereals until they have considered the financial question more thoroughly.   But they propose to allow bunker coal to neutral vessels proceeding to the Plats only on the condition that these vessels undertake to return with car-goes to the United States;   and they incline to the view that this is the simplest method of securing the Argentine sur-plus.   It would, however, be necessary, for the success of
9 9^ 6.this scheme, that we should not give British bunker . coal for the direct voyage to tho Plate to any ships of the northern neutral countries.   She plan is ingenious but would seem to involve unnecessary complications and delays.SJQ&amp;Uiffii  BaOGKApf.
