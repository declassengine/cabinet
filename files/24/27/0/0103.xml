II 14V) 4Minister for Poreign Affairs notes that Japanese Government have no interest in European War, hut will help H0M* Government if threatened in Eastern Asia .with all their strength., when called on,   German Ambassador informed,       (]?.0o II 154).,In case of attack on Hongkong or Wei-hai-wei or similar concrete act of aggression Japan ready to give support at once if called on3 In case of capture of British merchant ship or case involving (say) question of Chinese or Russian territorial waters, would wish oppor-tunity of considering and consulting with Hai * Government before taking definite action.       (r.0* II 155).AUGUST 4, His Majesty1s Government will avoid if possible &quot;drawing&quot;Japan into trouble.     (lVOa II 192).AUGUST.6A       Japan asked by British Government to assist in tracking German armed ships attacking British commerce in China seas. II 277(b).).AUGUST^9o       As compliance would amount to beginning hostilities against Germany, Japan unwilling to limit action to this, but ready to declare war with object of destroying German power in the East,   &quot;Japan must have a free hand and no limited liability,&apos;1     (P.O. II 349).
AUGUST 10. British Govt . decide not to appeal to Japanunder tho Treaty, as they wish to limit acts of war in Far East to the sea.   (F.0. II 574)*From F.0. n 386 and 412 it is clear that Japan, if not appealed to by Great Britain, proposed to declare war on Germany independently , consequently onAUGUST 11. Great Britain agreed to a declaration ofwarHBy Japan on Germany with certain limitations of objective and operations.   (F. 0. II 409).AUGUST 12 . Japanese Govt . agree to a proclamationcontaining the suggested clause &quot;The two Govts . having been in consultation are of opinion that it is necessary     \ for each to take action to protect the general interests  * &apos; contemplated by the Anglo-Japanese alliance .&quot;That &quot;the action of Japan will not extend(b) to the Pacific Ocean beyond the China Seas nor extend beyond Asiatic waters westward of the China Seas, or to any foreign territory except territory in Gorman occupation on the continent in Eastern Asia,&quot; as suggested by Sir E. Grey, could not be inserted in the proclamation .   But formal assurance could be given to Gt. Britain and any other Power, such as America or Holland, Gt. Britain might indicate.   (F.0. II 435b).AUGUST 15 . Sir E. Grey desired to make public thisclause as soon as Japan declared war,    (P.0- II 583. see also 480).Japan decides on ultimatum to Germany in preference to declaration of war .   Ultimatum expiring 23rd handed in on 17th.   (F-0* 663).AUGUST 17. Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs statesJapan&apos;s attitude rests on Anglo--Japanese alliance: she hasno territorial designs.   This is reproduced in Press. (F.0. II 606).AUGUST 18. British Foreign Office authorises publicationby Press Bureau of statement (a) and (b) above. (F.0. II 620).This statement suggesting the British Govt. is imposing limitation on Japanese action Is resented by Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs, who on 18th had stated his Goit. would take no action to give the Powers any anxiety for the safety of their possessions.   (F.Q; II 661, 664 , 751).British co-operation in the attack on Tsingtau was decided on with a view to reassuring Chinese, Australian and neutral opinion, which was highly mistrustful of Japan. Japan welcomed the co-operation, \.hich the previous corres-pondence had led her not to expect.   (F.0. n 523).French and Russian military co-operation was not welcome to Japan.   (F*o. II 640, 731). :
AUGUST 22      On August 22nd the Japanese Ambassador in London was informed confidentially that a New Zealand expedition was on its way to occupy Samoa and another from Australia to occupy the Carolines, German New Guinea and the other German Islands in the Pacific.     (F.O. II 727).AUGUST 23.     War was declared on Germany. (P.O. II 736)Japanese belligerent action did in fact exceed the geogra-phical limits the British Government had tried to impose.   Her ships acted in various parts of the Pacific: e.g0, cruised out-side Honolulu to prevent the escape of the GEIER, escorted the Australasian Expeditionary Porce into the Indian Ocean, took part in the combined operations to circumscribe the       move-ments of Admiral von Spee, and the EMLEN, subsequently took charge of the Eastern Seas, and part of the Indian Ocean.In October the Marshall Islands and part of the Carolines, including Yap, were occupied by the Japanese.   A claim to remain in occupation of these islands began to develop.   In November an Australian force designed to relieve the Japanese was countermanded, pending agreement between Japan and Great Britain.In December the Japanese stated frankly that they proposed to keep the German islands North of the Equator.   The British Government pointed out that all occupations of enemy territory during the war must be provisional.   The Japanese replied that nevertheless they counted on British support, at the time of settlement, to their retention of these islands. The British Government refused to be pledged, as the Treaty of September 5th precluded any separate agreement apart from Prance and Russia, but recognised that Japanese action had exceeded the limits proposed in August and that this would have to Tae taken into account.     The Australian expedition was cancelled and the Japanese have remained in possession. (F.O. IT 322,349)FROM SECRET PAPERS IN POKSIGN OFPIOE.Concurrently with the somewhat grddging conduct of Japan&apos;s allies towards her action in the Pacific, her military and naval co-operation in Europe was the subject of confidential discussion.The despatch of Japanese troops to Prance was apparently first mooted by the Japanese Ambassador in Petrograd at the end of August 1914.   M. Sazonof, the Russian Minister for Poreign Affairs, and the French Ambassador in Petrograd adopted the suggestion with some eagerness.On the 31st M. Sazonof urged the British and French Governments to take up the idea vdth the Japanese Government: He would instruct the Russian Ambassador in Tokio to back his colleagues.    (F.O. 45088)SEPTEMBER 2   The French Government attached great importance to accepting the &quot;offer&quot;    (F.O. 45669)SEPTEMBER 5. The Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs agodii urgod action at&quot;tfokio (F.O. 46069)SEPTEMBER 4. The Japanese Ambassador in Petrograd;&apos; asked the British Ambassador what were H.M, Government&apos;s views (F.0.46523)The British Ambassador in Tckio was instructed to find out what the Japanese Government thought on the subject.
SEPTEMBER 3.   Despatch of haval Poroe to West also suggested by Sir C. Greene   (F.0. 46158 Secret.) at instance of Pritish Admiralty.SEP TIMBER 9b.   Japan could not at present send ehips to Europe would temporarily replace in the East ships needed in the West. (Pear of America responsible for this).    (F.0. 48006 Secret).OCTOBER 29.   It was reported from Tokio that a Japanese syndicate was asking the Canadian Insurance Co., to quote rates for 100,000 to 500,000 Japanese troops to be transferred to Prance. There was no reason to suppose the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs had changed his views, but there were signs of publio interest in the question.    (F,0. 64991).NOVEMBER 2, Sir C. Greene was instructed to ask if the Minister for Foreign Affairs would re-consider hio decision. (F.0. 66773).NOVEMBER 4. He agreed to consult his colleagues. He stipulated in advance that the troops would be used,(a) side by side with British troops on the main front and indioated that he anticipated financial difficulties (F.0. 67310) (b)NOVEMBER 6...   The British Ambassador was instructed to give assurance as to (a) and to hold out prospect of assistance as to (b) (No. 3 Private and Secret).NOVEMBER 9.     The, question was widely discussed in the Japanese press.The Vice Uinister of Var was of opinion that a force of 400,000 men would be necessary to make any impression and that such a force could not be supplied.   He would like Lord Kitchener&apos;s views.    (F.0, 68792)NOVEMBER 14.   After several Cabinet meetings the proposal was declared unacceptable both on ground of principle and of praotical possibility.(a) as before - conscript army etc.,(b) expense and transport difficulty were prohibitive and country would be denuded of forces.SEPTEMPER 3,   The answer was that the Japanese army recruited hy obligatory servioe for homo defence could not be asked to act a3 professional soldiers in European countries of which they had no knowledge and in which they took no interest. (No. 128 from Tokio&quot;).SEPTEMBER 4. This answer was accepted as final for the time. Prance and Russia were informed :-551 to Bordeaux 678 to Petrograd116 to Tokio.
When questioned the Minister for Foreign Affairs said it was &quot;useless to press further.&quot;    (F.O. .71385)..As to naval assistance in ZJurope, also proposed at this time, the answer was if possible still more categorical. The Cabinot was unanimous against this.   (i&apos;.0, 71386)..NOVEMBER g.   First Lord to Japanese Minister of Marine :-&quot;Early In Hew Year we hope to be strong enough to enter the Baltic and increase Naval pressure on Germany. By that tine not only will Tsingtau have fallen, but probably the German outlying cruisers will have been destroyed. &quot;We should like our Japanese Allies to look forward to this situation in order to consider how the powerful Naval aid they are giving may be made to play a decisive oart in the conclusion of the war.&quot;    (P.0. 66788. Secret.)NOVEMBER 14.   British Admiralty to Japanese Admiralty:-Fall of Tsingtau and blocking of KONIGSBURG and destruction of EMDEN have cleared Indian and Pacific Oceans, save coast of Chili.     Suggest (1) Squadron at Guadaloupe should pursue SCHARNHoRST and GNEISSNAU, and (2) that other ships should be disposed to prevent their return from Chilian coast to Pacific. (3)   Suggest that Japanese should send a squadron to block German-Turkish Fleet in the Dardanelles.    (P.O. 71387 Secret).This crossed with 71386 from Tokio - refusing Naval Expedition to Europe.&quot;If England is in desperate straits might change their mind.&quot;NOVEMBER 18.   Japanese agree to. (1) and (2).NOVEMBER 21.. Negative (3). ::iill do all they can to help in Pacific    D&apos;.&apos;.0. 74101. Secret).NOVEMBER 28.If questioned in the Diet, the Minister for Foreign Affairs wished to be able to say (as the negotiation had been confidential), that no European Government had asked for despatch of Japanese troops to Europe.NOVEMBER 30. Sir      Grey objected to so categorical a denialand suggested the form &quot;no official demand&quot; has been made, but&quot;the general question of the employment of Japanese troops may bethe subject of confidential discussion from time to time.. (F*0.76629-).DECEMBER 5.The Japanese Minister for Poreign Affairs agreed to this.    (F.o. 76627),   But from Press reports he aooears to have used the more direct &quot;formula&quot;.    (For questions and answers in Diet see War Print V 127).
The Government was defeated in the Diet on the 24th (?26th).   In fact baron Kato expressed himself as Sir E. Grey had suggested, but added that It was unlikely any such event (as the use of Japanese troops in Europe) would take place. (F.O. 88516).This phrase discouraged the reopening of the question though France and Russia reverted to it very frequently.DECEMBER 10.   Offers by a volunteer association conmunicated through the British Embassy in Tokio to r/r . Asquith were declined .   (F*0- 2942).
From January to May 1915 when (25th) an agreement was signed, Japan was engaged in a controversy with China.   The demands made on China were so extensive that they caused considerable embarrassment to Japan&apos;s allies.    In February Japan communi-cated its demands to France and asked for the support of the French Government.An article in the &quot;Temps&quot; of February 14 suggested advantage should be taken of this to re-open negotiations for Japanese military co-operation in Europe. (F.O. V 298) .At the same time the matter was being discussed freely in the Japanese press, which on the whole was not favourable to the enterprise. (F.O. V 546).On February 15th Japanese army reservists Were ordered not to associate themselves with any such movement.   There was still an association to gather volunteers for an expedition to Burope.The question was not revived, in the same form but dis-cussions as to the conversion of the An^lo-Japanese alliance into a. quad.ru.ple allinn.ee with France and Russia -   .alterna-tively a Russo-Japanese alliance led to no finite result.The supply of rifles and munitions by Japan to Russia bee ame the en &quot;;ro s sin.^ sub j e c t.193.5.     in October 1915 Japan adhered to the compact of September 5th,  1914 and thus became allied for the period of the war to the Entente Powers.1916^     In Hove.rr.ber (22nd) 1916 Viscount Motono,  the Japanese Ambassador in Petrograd who had suggested Japanese military intervention in Europe, became Minister for Foreign Affairs.   He found it impossible to obtain acceptance of his views in Japan, where neither co-operation on the Russian nor on the French front was acceptable to official opinion.1917.     The Foreign Office is at present engaged in the consideration of a French proposal for the employment of Japanese troops on the Salonica and other fronts.2, Whitehall Gardens,  S.W. 3rd October,  191&apos;; .
