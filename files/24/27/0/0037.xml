THIS DOCUMENTiSHT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNICMAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTiSECRET-G.T.-2137WAR0 A B I IE T,THE IRISH SITUATION,Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.Politically, the outstanding incidents of the past week have been the commonosment of a dofinite campaign on tho part of the Nationalists against revolutionary Sinn Fein by a striking speech from Mr* John Dillon, M..P. and tho completion in a series of meetings at Gork of the first stage in the labours of the Irish Convention.Mr. Dillon addresaod a big and well-organised meeting of Nationalists in Bailieborough, Go. Gavan, on Sunday-   The sise and the enthusiasm of the assembly shewed that the Nationalists still have a large following among the older men although evidences multiply that tho young men9 the enthusiasts, and the Revolutionaries have for the most part deserted thorn. Besides making a forceful attack on the Sinn Fein leaders for want of any ooherent or rational policy, he promised the meeting that &quot;tho Party&quot; will fight them at tho polls, and predicted that the opportunity of a decision would not be long delayed.      The meeting and ajpeeoh appear to have had a heartening effect upon the Nationalists and to have caused some discontent to their opponents, who have reeponded with a good deal of abusive oritioium.   I have no doubt that recent developments had oil the whole told against the Extremists. The vague and contradictory character of their declarations and their withdrawal from threats of immediate insurrection have exposed in some measure the futility of much of their
conduct *     It&quot; is an exceedingly unhappy clroimYstanee that r:.t this juncture the death in hospital in Dublin oif one of the recently sentenced Sinn Jfoln prisoners&apos;^ sS the result: of collapse due to a &quot;hunger-etrike&quot; has given a new. impulse to violent resentment whioh I had hoped might aeon die down.Sir Horace Plunkott!s optimistic speech at Cork, when he was able to announce publicly that the Convention has unanimously appointed a Grand Committee to formulate defi-nite proposals as to the future Government of Ireland for consideration by tho Convention oh t^e next occasion of its coming together, has been very well received among aftl classes except the Extremists.   As I have before suggested thero la a wave of optimism about the &quot;prospeots of the Convention whioh as yet has no justification except in the discovery that a hundred Irishmen of conflicting views and varying positions could be brought together for debate without real danger of a faction fight among them,  he Grand Committee will, I believe, call for profoc-sional assistance in their labours, and it would perhaps be advisable that if this happens they should have at their commend the help &quot;not only of tho Draftsman of the Irish Office, Mr8 Qreor, but also Sir Arthur Thringor Sir Freak. Liddell.   All three are very familiar with the Home Rule question.Some recent experiences In the journeys I have mada In the Irish provinces, and in ordinary administrative matters, hav9 convinced me that I ought to bring to the notice of the v.&apos;ar Cabinet the disadvantage there is to tho Government in the disability which at present pre-vents the Chief Secretary as its representative from
dealing promptly with questions of no great weight which involve any expenditure.   The:non-development by the State of Irish industries:is a constant grievance;   thore are  -small coal fields in Leinutor;   thore is a coal field with iron-tftone oloae by at Arigna in the ftest;   in oach. instance the construction of a abort railway connection,-: 7 miles in one case and 3-^ miloo in the- other&apos; is urgently, required and is feasible, but coal control, control of material, and 3ar Regulations prevent it, and the Railway Executive Committee in Ireland, which oould secure the making of a minuto railway if I could sanction the exponditure is helpless because I cannot.   At half a dozen points on the West and Morth coasts &quot;the fishermen are hamyered and food supplies are lost for want of outlay upon small harbour works., such as pier extension., blasting and dredging.     The-discontent which results is as unfortunate as the loss.   In certain districts which I visited in Donegal the peasantry aro cutting away and burning tho peaty surface of their holdings because they cannot reach neighbouring turf-bogy for want of roads.     At Dublin the prospoct of a wintor of grave peril is aggravated by my inability oven to sanction or obtain sanction for small publlo workB vhioh would&apos; give relief.     Orderly administration and even public safety depend upon the police in many districts;   but trivial applications for little benefits which are asked for to sweoten their labours, get turned down by permanent officials at the Treasury whose business is to say &quot;NO&quot;. -   Instances could be multiplied., but the substance of thic matter is that there ere constantly occasions when the power to sanction promptly some moderate (or even trivial) beneficial outlay, would help the whole business of government, and that no Minister working Dingle-handed, as the Chief Secretary for Ireland has at present to
do, can devote to them the time and energy which are-necessary to overcome the proper automatic resistance of the Treasury against novel expenditure.    A judicious outlay in Ireland during the next one, two or even three years, of say two million pounds in works to meet urgent demands would in my belief do good in the country to on extent in no way measured by the amount involved,     -But the propriety of allowing tho Minister responsible for government in Ireland to decide, subject to some reasonable limit, whether necessary steps shall be taken in such directions as I have indicated Is, I think, unquestion-able, and the Chief Secretary for the time being would be greatly helped if it were recognised,.(This is not a complaint, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has met every specific case I here referred to him..   But some matters are not large enough to bring to his attention after an adverse decision;    time is required for the appeal which cannot always be found;   and in the more important cases,.the meterial thing is to be able to say promptly on the spot, where end when a question of no great magnitude arises - &quot;the Government will do what is asked &quot; or - with confidence that a reeommen&amp;a-tion will be effective - &quot;1 will recommend its boing done&quot;).(Initialled)   E.E.D.27th September, 1917,
