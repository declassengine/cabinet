ftc        1 33 E a ^ 1   L0 : ? &apos;EBPOI!T&apos;frorQ the liIHSTKY&apos; 0? LABOUR on the LABOUR SITUATION   for   the   week   ending September 26th.1,   . STRIKES.Ho improvement has taken place in. Scotland where the strike of Ironmouiaers is spreading all over the eountjry.On the 20th the situation was somewhat easier, but on the 21st the movement began to spread to the East of Scotland and on that date it was estimated that the number of men on strike was 8000. On the 23rd a mass meeting of Ironmoulders was held at Edinburgh and decided to cease work in sympathy with the other districts.   The leaders, who are P.KoGovern, Chairman of the Emergency Committee, liddell, its secretary, Bell and McBain of the Associated Ironmoulders of Scotland, and McLean and McGrail of t&amp;e Central Ironmoulders1 Association are calling meetings in all towns in Scotland where Ircnmoulders are employed with a view to getting them out, and are moving about the country with that end in view.   They are confident that a general strike of Scottish Ironmoulders will take place during the week.On the 21st two delegates of the Emergency Committee came to London and were received at the Ministry of Labour.   It was pointed out to them that, the strike being unauthorised, it was impossible to take any steps with regard to considering their demands.   On the 22nd a mass meeting at Glasgow was held by the Exeoutive of the Ironmoulders Association.   W.i:o3eth, the Vice President, was in the chair and both he ana John Brown, the secretary, met with a very hostile reception, a large majority of those present being clearly supporters of the Emergency Committee.   On the 24th the latter body held z. mess meeting in Glasgow v/hich was attended by about 2000 men, end at which it was decided to continue the strike and if possible to bring out all the other Ironmoulders in Scotland.The situation shews no sign of improvement at present.The Strike of rivetters on the Tyne which involved 1300 men cane to an end on the 21st.   The men&apos;s contention there the award of the Committee on Production as regards ratsrs on standard ships should be retrospective from the commencement of the building of those ships was upheld by the Committee.   The men at Messrs. Swan and Hunter and V/allsend refused to resume work until they obtained a guarantee from the firm that they would fulfill the conditions of the Award and fi:; a date from Which the arrears will be paid.   The men have now returned.A strike of joiners wheih arose over a demarcation dispute with tb-^ shipwrights took place at Messrs. Harland and Jqlffs, Belfast on the 19th*   The stoppage which involved more than a thousand men only lasted for one day, the joiners winning their point. Demarcation disputes between shipwrights and joiners are of constant ooo  Te.nce, and as the work upon which they are engaged is of urgent national importance it would appear advisable that general steps Bhoiiia be taken to clear up the situation.In the South ffales Coalfield the strike at the Gwaun-cae-Gurwen colliery continues.   The threatened general stoppage of work in the
anthracite district in connection with this strike has been postponed pending a decision by the Coal Controller on the point at issue in the first named dispute,A stoppage of work took plaoe in nearly all the collieries in the South Staffordshire district on Friday and Saturday last, the number&quot;oTTISen affected being&apos; about 12000 and the cause of the strike being the coal controller1 e reply to the general demand for an Increase of 25$ on present wages.   Owing, to the Goal Controller1s efforts the men were induced to resume work on Monday, but their temper is not disposed for compromise and Bome ef the collieries in the Old Hill district are again idle.The Lew Laithes Colliery (Yorkshire) and the Presley Colliery (South Derbyshire) are still idie.   In :&apos;che la11er case the strike is unofficial end the matter is being taken up by the Miners1 Federation.The position in the Ulster Linen Industry has not improved. A statement has been issued&apos; by the Minister of Labour, who has been dealing with the dispute, point in-; out the fact that the strike is illegal and declaring that the appointment of the arbitrator which has already been made must stand unless the two parties can mutually agree to another.   Attention is drawn to the seriousness of the position and the strikers are called upon to resume work pending the decision of the arbitrator.   The employers still refuse a8oept the arbitrator appointed by the Ministry (Mv.Vesey Knox K.C.) or the alternative proposed by the men (Lord Pirrie), and threaten to look out the men, who are preparing to return to work.In Yorkshire there was a one day Strike of woolcombers, involving between 10,000 and 12,000 workers, and arising out of the omission of women workers from the recent wages arbitration award.   The strike came to an end when it was made clear that the award should be extended to women workers.   The exact proposals which involve an actual increase of 11/- per week on pre-war rates were made known on Sunday and were favourably received.The total strikes recorded by the Statistics Department as having been in progress during the week are 75, a number considerably above the average.(
II.   DISPUTES.The number of disputes reported by the Shipyard Labour Department this week is 11&quot;;.   Considerably more &quot;than half of these took place on the Clyde and the majority of the remainder from the Newcastle district.   Of the total number 37 were successfully settled, while in 13cases stoppages of work could not be avoided.In the Coalmining industry there are a &quot;number of outstanding disputes the most important of which are that between the South V/ales Colliery Examiners and the Owners, and the general demand for a 25&quot;? Increase in the wages of coalminers.   In the former case a representative of the Coal Controller met the owners on Wednesday of last week and a conference of both sides is being held this week which it is hopeci will lead to the suspension of the notices whioh have keen handed in by the Examiners.   The Coal Controller is today holding a further conference with the Executive of the Miners Federation of Great Britain in connection with the offer of an increase of 1/33 per day in wages v/hich was made last week. It is not expected that this offer will be aocepted and In the event of its refusal the situation will become one of gravity.Ho sooner has the threatened strike of the Yorkshire 7/00I-oombers been averted, than a new difficulty has arisen in the woollen and worsted trades generally.   The Employers&apos; Federation at Bradford reoently refused a demand for an increased war bonus. k Conference representing most of the important unions in the Leeds-Huddersfield district has been held, at whioh it was agreedtfchat members should be advised to tender their not ioes on the 4th or 5th of October.   If this threat becomes effective about 5C000 workers will be affected.The adjourned conference of London Operative and Master Bakers which was held on the 19th resulted as was expected in a deadlock, the attitude of several of the employers associations being decidedly uncompromising.   The workpeople have decided to enforce their demands as previously stated, and to holdua meetj^g-on October 15th to decide on the best means of stopping nightwork in bakeries throughout the. country.Strikes of bakers are reported from various mrts of England, Scotland and &apos;7ales; the point at issue is in most oases the question of increased wages.
III.   DISTRICT REPORTS.The situation is quiet, though there is said to be crumbling in some of the shops at Woolwich over certain local conditions.Arthur McManus who has in the past been one of the chief promoters of unrest on the Clyde has been in London during the week and is reported to have accepted employment in Messrs BeardmoreTs London works.   It is not yet known whether this step has been taken in order to facilitate propaganda.Except for the serious situation among the Staffordshire miners (referred to in section I &amp; V) the situation is normal.At Coventry there was some slight trouble at the Hotchkiss V/orks which resulted in a stoppage of work affecting  00 fitters.   The trouble appears to have arisen out of an attempt made by the firm to Introduce piece rates among some of the fitters.   Allegations were made that this trouble was stirred up by the Industrial workers of the &apos;7orld, an organ-isation to which public attention has recently been drawn in the newspapers.   No evidence of this has been reported, but Dingley, a notorious firebrand took an active part in the trouble.There is a good deal of unrest in this district among textile workers and miners, which had led to a number of spasmodic stoppages of work.   The trouble is chiefly due to demands for increased wages and in the woollen trade has so far been averted by substantial concessions which have been accepted.At Nottingham an important joint meeting of miners and railwaymen was held on Sunday at Which a resolution was passed calling upon &quot;the Pood Controller to take over all The foodstuffs in the country and share them out equally to every household in proportion to the number of the family. Failing a satisfactory answer to this a special conference of the Industrial Triple Alliance be called to adopt a down tools policy,f.     There was some opposition to the latter part of the motion on the grounds that it might jeopardise the effective conduct of the war, but the main proposals of the resolution was received with enthusiasm.The position is for the time being quiet.At Liverpool the Boilermakers held an important meeting on the 20th, at which great discontent was expressed at what had happened, particularly in regard to the refusal of assistance by the Mersey Trades Federation,    It was decided to continue at work for the present, but that a united strike of all the allied trades in the district, and if possible in other parts of the country, should take   place in the event of the next^revision of wages proving unsatisfactory.At Barrow the Shop Stewards held a meeting on the 23rd for the purpose of electing officers.   Parkinson was elected President and most of the others were men whose names have frequently come to the fore in the past.Some meetings have been held at Barrow during the past week at which the chief subjects of resolutions have been the Billeting Act and the basis of assessment for Income Tax which is calling forth increasing opposition.   The decision of the Ministry of Munitions to construct 1000 houses ought to have a good effect.This district is somewhat restless, particularly as regards the mining and shipbui1ding i ndustries,/ The
The miners have &quot;been experiencing a considerable shortage of work and this combined with high food prices and rStfBiparativeiy low wages has produced a truculent frame of mind.   Trouble over the Coal Controller&apos;s offer is expected locally.There has been much discontent among rivetters and other classes oi r-Orkers employed by the lai\;e shipbuilding firms ever since the trouble over rates on.standard ships arose.   This question has now been settled and the tension appears to be somewhat relaxed, though in some cases strikes are still in progress.h feles. The situation in South Jales has become easier duringthe week several strikes having come to an end, so that at the moment the number of men who are out is not very considerable.There has been some renewal of the discussions about the recruiting of miners and grumbling at the failure of the Executive to take any action.   The agitation about the income tax would also appear to be increasing.The Ironmoulders strike is referred to in Section I. x\part from this conditions are jJwrmal.The Annual Meeting of the Scottish Advisory Council of the Labour Party took ^lace on Saturday. &quot;Its chief feature was a temperate speech by Robert Smillie, the president, in   favour of peace by negotiation.The Industrial Workers of Great Britain is at the moment the most progressive of the extremisT bodies on the Clyde and is apparently seeking to saddle the movement as a whole with its policy.   In view of this it is noteworthy that a decision to oppose the recommendations of the VJhitley Committee has been taken.In Ireland there continues to be a good deal of unrest, particularly in the linen industry.   Public attention has been called to the exceedingly low rates of wages which are paid by certain firms in that industry and which ase so low as to suggest that no revision has taken place during the war.
The criticisms of the Labour press on Sir Auckland Geddcs1 speech have now been received.     The &quot;Herald&quot; says:-&quot;There is&quot;on the surface nothing objectionable in tho plans &quot;put forward by Sir A. Geddes.    Everything, in fact, &quot;depends on how the new machinery is worked, and we assure &quot;the new Director that labourls eye is on him, and that the &quot;time for playing any tricks or making any movement in the. &quot;direction of industrial conscription has Ion- gone past..&apos;&apos; Similarly the &quot;Gall&quot; writes:-   &quot;The intention to., ask for a &quot;drastic extension of National. Service iajnot. denied...,It &quot;is evident that something is In the wind.     If the old &quot;system of enrolment is to be abandoned and something else &quot;put in its place, then It must be compulsion in some form &quot;or other.    Compulsory Labour&apos;   in whatever form is &quot;Industrial Conscription,     The swift ami &quot;determined action &quot;of the Labour movement on the lasi occasion Industrial     . &quot;Conscription was attempted effectively wrecked the scheme1, &quot;and sent Mr. Neville Chamberlain back to his home.-,   -v:le&apos;-&apos;: &quot;trust that the workers will he alert to this new attempt &quot;and suppress it as offactively.&quot;     &quot;Justice&quot; has a non-committal article which contains the following:-    &quot;V.re are &quot;by no means clear as to the precise objects which Sir &quot;Atielcland Geddes has in view from his interview with the &quot;Glasgow deputation last Saturday.,  ;; &apos;.Tie the r he is going to &quot;reveal the military mind later, time&apos;will show.    At present &quot;he appears to be following far too much in Lr. Neville &quot;Chamberlain^s footsteps&quot;.The &quot;New Witness&quot; points out that &quot;fche most controver-&quot;sial question ..... is of course the way in which any &quot;solution of the problem is&apos;to affect the Trade Unions.   If &quot;it oan work with the Trades Unions &quot;and especially with the &quot;sound moral principle of the Trades Unions, other difficul-&quot;tiee may well be excused to so difficult a task in so &quot;deadly a crisis. - If it attempts to provide or ignore that &quot;principle, it will call forth the final opposition of all &quot;those whoere resisting theapproach of pagan slavery,... &quot;We prefer to give Sir Auckland Oeddes the benefit of the Vdoubt in this and other things;   for he is a man who is &quot;undoubtedly trusted, rightly&apos;or wrongly, for work which he &quot;is really doing.&quot;The appointment of the hew Advisory Conmittoes has been welcomed generally in the daily press.    The&apos;   &quot;&quot; &quot;Blanchestar Guardian&quot; has an &quot;article typical of the view widely expressed that these-committees.will have far reaching beneficial results.     It; c oncludes:-     &quot;The &quot;reforms proposed put -into the-hands of. labour thepower to &quot;secure what is lacking -in the system, and. advant^e must &quot;be taken of the-chance to give the Exchanges the place in &quot;the life of the country which they were intended to fill &quot;and which, after the war, will bo more important tto, ever &quot;before.:!Under the heading &quot;Your food will cost you mere&quot; Mr. Robert Williams has;, an -article in the &quot;Herald&quot;; tree in-  the enhancement in tlie cost of food to the inflation of the currency which again is due to the existing capitaliot system ofpayingfor the war: by loans in Place of by conscription of wealth.     He admits that increased wu-.es tend to,increased prices.     &quot;There is of course a vicious &quot;circle.&apos;but .1 .would. say to my workinp class friends..... Tlthat.-while the vicious circle -remains it is better to be &quot;Inside than out.&quot;    -The &quot;Clarion&quot; deals with- the samesubject/
subject.     It says:-   &quot;.... Lord Rhohdda has been &quot;appointed to control food trices, and if the Chancellor of &quot;the Sxchecuer, by his methods of raisin;; war loans inflates &quot;the currency, raises prices and so destroys the barriers &quot;against profiteering built up by Lord Rhondda*s regulations &quot;the public will be rightfully angry.    Lord Rhondda must &quot;make the inflation of the currency his business in order &quot;to justify his own work..    Inflation of the currency is &quot;nothing but a form of profiteering.&quot; -       -The advent&apos; of the ninepenny loaf lias been the subject of much comment.     The &quot;&apos;Westminster Gazette&quot; in a leading article dwells on the danger of resultant increased con-sumption. .   &quot;Justice&quot; writes:-   &quot;So we have got the nine-&quot;penny loaf, instead of the sixpenny loaf, by kicking the &quot;Government. &quot;   Ii the workers load kicked them as hard as &quot;the Mational   or2:ersr Committee and the H.3.?, wished, we &quot;should have got the 6d, perhaps the &amp;Jd. loaf&quot;.....we have &quot;not given up the demand for the sixpenny loaf and we hope &quot;to push the&apos;agitation for it to the front this coming &quot;winter&quot;.     In another place the sane journal thinks that &quot;the best thing the Food Linistry can do is to set about &quot;local rationing without delay&quot; in view of the v^rld shortage of. wheat, instanced by the closing clo,::n of the great Minneapolis flour mills.The question ^of the constitution of the Food Control Committees has given rise to a great deal of local agitation, which is neglected in the Press of the week.The suppression of the revolt by General Korniloff has lod to much criticism in the Labour Press on the subject of the attitude assumed by the &quot;Times&quot;, &quot;Homing post&quot;, and other Conservative journals.     The most exhaustive and bitter article is that in the &quot;Herald&quot;, under the title &quot;The British Korriiloffs&quot;.   , The riiole article is highly critical, the following extracts being typical:-   &quot;In its fervency &quot;for the counter revolution &quot;public opinion&quot; in the West &quot;(as expressed in the leading organs of the Press) became &quot;unashamedly partisan.     No considerations of tact or &quot;international eorrectitude were allowed to stand in the wayConsider its cynical significance.   If Russia is no &quot;longer a paying proposition she is to be written off... &quot;He was the hero of the hour.     His was the right action; &quot;he xzls not the mutineer, but Korensky.     The mildest head-nine was Kerensky versus Eorniioff&quot; and all the odds were &quot;on Korniloff.... How wickedly stupid it appears now, after &quot;the event,,,.. The lead uas given by the &quot;Times&quot;,... This &quot;lead was at once accented by the&apos;less responsible mass of &quot;the Press, wMoh openly backed Zorniloff and frankly &quot;treated his advance as a punitive expedition against JT?etrograd,... Events have proved the&quot;grotesque folly of &quot;all this ignorance and perversity, morally and materially &quot;the defect has been overwhelming..... &quot;
The &quot;Bradford pioneer&quot; describes the &quot;Times&quot; and tlifi ^ornin?:- post&quot; as nearly jumping for joy on receipt of tJjo news of&quot;the revolt. -   The &quot;Labour&apos; reader&quot; writes in a strain similar to that employed by the &quot;Herald&quot;.     in an article headed &quot;Eomiloff and our Eorniloffians&quot; it says;-&quot;The &quot;Times&quot;, the &quot;looming Post&quot;, and those other organs of &quot;reaction in this country who opened their arms to the &quot;rebellious General and shouted their comfort and sympathy &quot;to him, have had bitterness for their portion.&quot;     The &quot;Call&quot; prints, a leader:-   &quot;Tho Eorniloffs at Home and Abroad&quot;, uhich contains the following:-   &quot;Look how the section of the &quot;Press which is the mouthpiece of the capitalist classes and &quot;of the Government itself lias unblushingly supported &quot;Korniloff :s endeavour:   how pleasureably anticipated his &quot;victory, and the subsequent crushing of the Soviets and all&quot;the hated institutions of the Revolution......... The&quot;British working class knows hot? what value it has to attach &quot;to the daily calls^ from the columns of the British press, &quot;for the German people to rise and it knows what will happen &quot;to itself if it. were to rise in defence of its rights. The &quot;Eorniloffs are in our own rnidst as well as In Russia and if &quot;we do not dispose of them now, we may be late to-norrow.&quot;&quot;Forward&quot; concludes a long article in similar vein as follows:-   &quot;I-.&apos;r. Lloyd George is the one front rank: &quot;capitalist politician who stepped out during the dark days &quot;folloyjlng irpon the Riga disaster to re-proclaim his faith, &quot;in the Russian Revolution .... the fact of his testimony &quot;remains, and it may assist in preventing to some extent &quot;the growth in Russia of an anti-British sentiment, fostered &quot;for a surety by the frank^ pro-aristooiatic plunge taken &quot;by the balk of our capitalist press.&quot;The &quot;Herald&quot; publishes an article on the subject of General Snnits1 statement that Germany is defeated and knows it, using it as an argument in favour of immediate peacet &quot;Surely if the aims and objects for which Germany entered the &quot;war are now impossible of attainment for her, she and her &quot;armies and her militarist chiefs are defeated, and no &quot;amount of further bloodshed can add to or tako avyay from&quot;that fact.....*&apos;c are all eager for the German people to&quot;make peace..... It is up to organised labour to make an &quot;effort to clear up the position.&quot;The &quot;Labour Leader&quot;, in an article entitled &quot;The Light that is Stockholm&quot; publishes a manifesto from the Organising Committee of the Stockholm Conference, calling fcr a further Inter Allied Conference, which delegates from Stockholm would attend, as a preliminary to an International Con-ferehee at a later date.     The &quot;Call&quot; disputes the allegation that the Belgian Socialists were averse to Stockholm, on the strength of an interview with the Belgian Eokellers, published in !e Populaire.The &quot;Call&quot; protests against the organised opposition to pacifist meetings.     &quot;Tho interference with the right of &quot;public meeting has reached a oritical stage.     It is now &quot;practically impossible to obtain a hall ii tile object of &quot;the meetiir: is in any way opposed to the war, and in Places our open-air meetings are being obstructed or prevented by jingo hooligans..., Alreadv two regular meeting: Places in &quot;London - Victoria Park end Highbury Corner, - have been rendered impossible for us.&quot;     The opposition is described as this organised hooliganism, redolent of the worst rays of Tearism, inspired from a source that scorns.to have8. contact/
contact with the blackguards it emjiojfm. .&quot;Forward&quot; records that the Paisley Town. Council have refused the use of the Towsa Hall for a Sunday meeting; of the Independent Labour Party to be addressed by Hr. Philip Snowden.On the other hand,, the same paper has a paragraph on the subject of &quot;sinking without trace&quot; justifying the attitude of the sailors towards the German submarine cam-paign, remarkable In a Socialist paper.The &quot;Times&quot; publishes extracts from a letter written by Mr* H. Howard who had visited the front as a ropresenta-tive ox the Boileumkorc. The writer is enthusiastic in his description of the spirit of the men in the trenches, and lays stress on the responsibility of those at home to see that the Army wants for nothing.Government The &quot;Herald&quot; comments on the negotiati ons between the&quot;&quot;Collar6T7      Coal Controller and the 1/iners&apos; Federation:-   &quot;./e un&amp;er-&quot;stand that once more negotiations are to be resumed in &quot;the various districts, and that the Government refuse to &quot;grant the proposed national increase.     If tins is so, the &quot;Iliners1 Federation has been thwarted yet again in its &quot;attempt to get wage negotiations put on a national basis.&quot;The &quot;Bradford Pioneer&quot; criticises the number of controllers who have been found noceasary.     &quot;T;.c reason &apos;why all this control of prices has become necessary is &quot;that the competitive system has broken doim under the &quot;strain of war ..... It should no longer&apos;be&apos;bolstered up by &quot;Food Control Committees and the like .... but should fjEve &quot;way to a system of national ownership of all tae means of &quot;life,&quot;Housing. The agitation on the subject of housing continues andreports of meetings in many centres arc recorded in the columns of the Press.9.if
The Times of Tuesday the 25th heralds the beginning of a series of articleaf on the Labour situation witha 1 eading article&apos;of a somewhat alarmist -nature. r.&apos;lp&amp;rt from its rather misleading interpretation of the ideas underlying the extremist movement, the main purport of this article would appear to be the expression of a serious warning of the danger of very important upheavals in the near future.    Its sequel, on the 26th is a very deplorable attempt to belittle the services of organised labour during the war and to prove that it stands in opposition to the rest of the community.     Nothing could be better calculated than mischievous aspersions of this kind to play into the hands of the extremists.In certain respects the situation has, as a result of cheaper food, and the efforts of the Government to show that a better understanding is desired,.become easier, but on the whole the general situation must still be regarded as difficult, and signs are not wanting that grave-trouble may at any time break out, should a pretext arise which would give the unofficial leaders a good handle.The growth of unrest among the coal miners during the past few months has several times been noted in these reports, notably in that of August 15th, in which attention was drawn to very strong opposition on the part of the men to the : -----further recruitment of miners; an opposition which eventually led to the suspension of the scheme.   Following this came a number of serious strikes in various mining districts and several local demands for important increases in wages which were eventually formulated as an application for a national advance of 25fj by the Miners1 Federation of Great Britain, the Coal Controllers Concession of 1/3 per day has.just been published and the indications are that it will be received with greater hostility than was the 3/- engineering award, by Engineering and Allied Trades.The Black Country miners unanimously refused to accept the concession and 10,000 men were off work over the weekend. They are now reported to have returned to work on a day to day contract pending a meeting with the Coal Controller, but their temper is very uncertain.Local organisations&apos; in South Wales have already begun to pass resolutions of protest and the feeling generally in the district is one of discontent.The situation is reported to be similar in the Durham and Northumberland coal field, and it is exceedingly doubtful whether the men will be prepared to accept the offer.It will be remembered that in August there was serious ^trouble with the Locomotive Engineers and Firemen which was   &apos; averted partly owing to the strong stand taken by the executive.$$yb National Union of Railwaymen.   It is becoming-fvifrmV however, that rank: and file opinion in the National UniOii cf Railwaymen is in a disturbed state and shows the de&amp;ire evinced in other trades to take advantage of the war to force -ftasgt.concessions.. in August a Rank and File Conference and District Council Yigilance Committee was held in London which demanded the termination of the industrial truce entered into in 1914, an increased oermanent
wage of a pound a week anc- the conversion of war wa^es into permanent wa-:es.   i. determined, efftrt is - &quot;being made&apos; to &quot;bring&apos;, all the local branches into this movement, a minority only baring been present at London and at Liverpool on Sunday.an 0  important mass meeting attended by 1200 men and women . . .unanimously accepted a resolution embodying the above demands.It is not possible yet to say how far this movement has affected the whole of the National Union of Ralli aymen, but sufficient has been said to show that considerable unrest exists among the rank anc file of the two most powerful of the Unions comprised in the Triple Alliance.   The combined meeting of railwaymen and miners held at Nottingham (referred to In Section iii) actually called upon the Triple Alliance to declare a down tools policy in the event of certain proposals in regard to food not being adopted. The third Constituent, the Transport workers1 Federation which is the weakest member of the Alliance has embarked on a vigorous oampaign of reorganisation, and is also at the same time said to be contemplating the formulation of a demand for an all round incree.se in wa^es.   Negotiations are also rumoured to be taking place with a view to bringing in the various -gallons of postal and telegraph employees, so as.to add a fourth member of the Allianoe.This rather loose organisation, constituted since the war has not so far had an opportunity of testing its strength, but while it is perhaps improbable that the present opportunity will be taken , the fact that two of its important leaders, Messrs. Smillie and Williams, are strongly opposed to the war should hot be overlooked, though their attitude has provoked a good deal of criticism from their own supporters.The whole of the Engineering and allied Traces are increasingly restless.. The chief immediate cause of this is. no doubt the alleged inadequacy of the 3/- award, trouble over which was narrowly averted at the time of its issue, and ,, owing to which the serious strike of Ironmoulders (referred to in Section I) is at the present time taking place.   This award will come up for revision in October, about the time of the next Shops Stewards1 Conference and it is stated that the demand will once more be for an increase of 100/y.   It is significant.that the Mersey Boilermakers who were recently on strike and who are very discontented with the res-alt of the succeeding arbitration, resolved to defer action until October when they ex ect a national movement to take place.The delay over the withdrawal of the leaving certificate system and renewed, newspaper talk about combing out munitions factories have no conbt also contributed to disturb the engineers.Finally in the Yorkshire textile industry unrest has been increasing during the last two months and important strikes have on several occasions been narrowly averted * - 10,000 female woolcombers were indeed idle for a short time last week. A report has just been received that nine unions of textile workers have threatened to hand in notices unless substantial increases on the ^resent war bonus are - ranted, (Section II) so that the position here also is disturbing.  -Taking all the above evidence into aocount, it would appear that the situation for the future is distinctly
precarious.The demand for increased wages, whioh Was &amp; iginally basec! on the legitimate ground of tie great rise in ,&apos;rices, is.now tending to become unlimited and it remains to be 3een how far a fall in prices will check it.   In any event the next few months will call for considerable care and tact on the *art of all Departments which are in touch with Labour * y......    .D. J. SMpELETOU.MINISTRY Off LABOUR.rr   IS
