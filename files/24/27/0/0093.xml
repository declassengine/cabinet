(This Document is the Property ofHis Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)Circulated by the Secretary of State for India.J 0 1SECRET.India Office,My dear Cecil, 14th September 1917.In the discussion which took place in the Cabinet between us on the subject of Zionism, both you and Lord Milner suggested with such force that the views which I held were the views of a minority that I came to believe, and 1 think the Cabinet must have done so, that the views which I would remind you I only expressed ou my own behalf, were almost peculiar to myself and a few other eccentric individuals. I have, therefore, taken steps to find out the exact situation so far as possible, and I give you the facts as I have ascertained them below.I set. myself to discover whether Zionists are in a majority, and, if so, in a large majority, as regards the Jews of the United Kingdom. I am not aware that any plebiscite among a religious community has ever been taken in this or any other country on any subject, I can therefore only take the indirect evidence which is available, that afforded by the voting on a resolution passed by a body which I understand fairly represents the commuuit3r as a whole./The Jewish Board of Deputies may claim, I understand, something-approximating to a representative character. It consists of representatives of a considerable number of the synagogues of the United Kingdom. It is not completely representative, because some synagogues do not send members, some Jews do not become members of the synagogues which they attend and some do not attend them. Nevertheless, I am told that Zionists and non-Zionists alike would regard the Jewish Board of Deputies as the one body whose resolutions may be quoted as representing with some degree of correctness the opinion of the community as a whole.On the 17tli June a discussion took place at a meeting of this Board, followed by a division, and it is on this division that the best claim to a statement that the majority of British Jews are Zionists can be based. But I would remind you that the discussion and the division were not on Zionism itself, but on a side issue. There is in existence a conjoint Committee of the Board of Deputies and the Anglo-Jewish Association. This conjoint Committee published in The Times, of the 24th May, a letter which argued in favour of the granting to Jews in Palestine of civil and religious liberty, of facilities for emigration, colonisation, &amp;c, but opposed what the writers understood to be the two points of the Zionist claim, namely, that the Jewish settlers in Palestine should be (1) recognised as possessing a national character in a political sense ; and (2) invested with certain special rights in excess of those enjoyed by the rest of the population. (I may say that these views are more or less my own.)The letter was criticised on two grounds, namely, that it opposed the national idea which is the foundation of Zionism, and that the Joint Committee in issuing it on its own responsibility exceeded its rights as a mere executive committee of two parent organisations which should have-been consulted before a large declaration of policy was given to the world.This vote of censure obviously enlisted the support not only of Zionists, but also of those who felt the force of this latter criticism, and in the discussion the second point played a very large part. The vote was described in a Zionist newspaper, The Jewish Chronicle as &quot; a revolt &quot; against the system which has been in vogue far too long in our community, &quot;. the system of oligarchal repression.&quot;This vote of censure, which is the only numerical test of the alleged majority of Zionists among British Jews, was passed by 56 votes to 51. It-is to be remembered for the purpose which I have in discussing this matter that the issue of Zionism against non-Zionism was mingled with the questions arising out of an injudicious use of delegated power, but even if this is dismissed (and it ought not to be dismissed), all that can.be said is that the views that I hold and expressed in the Cabinet were held by practically half the only representative body which has expressed an opinion.I cannot, however, leave the subject, as I am.about to leave England for some months without reminding you that Zionism had a foreign origin, that
it was founded by Tlieodor Herzl, an Austrian, tliat his successor as leader of the Zionist movement was David Wolffsohn of Kolu, who was succeeded in. turn by Otto Warburg of Berlin. In conformity with the foreign origin of Zionism as a whole, Jews of foreign birth have played a very large part in the Zionist movement in England. Among its best known leaders in England are Dr. Gaster, a native of Roumania, Dr. Hertz, a native of Austria, and Dri Cliaim Weizmann, who is, I believe, a native of Russia, Of course, there arc English born leaders of the Zionist organisations in England, and I cannot speak with certainty as to the proportion in which the rank and file of the movement in England consists of persons of English and foreign birth respectively, but it is the common belief among the Jewish community that persons of foreign birth form a very large proportion of the Zionists in England. &apos;If a detailed enquiry were made as to the views on the Zionist question of. those who are responsible for such great institutions as the Board of Guardians for the Relief of the Jewish Poor, the Anglo-Jewish Association (which deals mainly with questions relating to Jews in the East), the Russo-Jewish Committee (which dealt with the great problem of Jewish emigration from Russia), the Jews&apos; Eree School, &amp;c., I think it would be found that the philanthropic work which represents the chief communal activity of Jews in England is to a preponderating extent done by Jews who have either expressed no sympathy with Zionism or who are actively opposed to it.   &apos;Now will you forgive me for saying that if I am right in thinking that Jews of British birth are in the main anti-Zionist, if I am right in thinking that Anti-Zionism is a belief held by at least half of the Jews of this country, what can be the motive for our Government, in the midst of its great pre-occupations and perplexities, doing anything in this matter ? To help the Allied cause in America was one of the reasons given in the Cabinet discussion. 1 did not see the terms of the telegram which jrou sent to America, but it is obvious that President Wilson does not wish for a definite statement conveying any real commitment at. present. This motive then goes by the board, and therefore I am impelled to urge once more that no form of words should be used by any spokesman of the British Government which implies that there is a Jewish people in the political sense and that any Jew who happens now to live in England, France, Italy or America is an exile in belonging to the English, French, Italian or American people among whom he dwells at present. Such a declaration would be felt as a cruel blow by the many English Jews who love England, tho birthplace of themselves and their ancestors for many generations, who wish to spend their lives in working for her, and whose highest aspiration is to continue to serve her.But I am particularly anxious to avoid a refusal to respond to Lord Milner&apos;s generous intention. There has been brought to my notice a body formed some years ago called &quot;The Jewish Territorial Organisation,&quot; which adopted the following words to explain its object: &quot;To obtain a territory &quot; . . . . for those Jews who cannot or will not remain in the lands in &quot; which they live at present.&quot; If it is desired to say anything, would this be any use ? :  *&quot;His Majesty^ Government accepts the principle that every opportunity should be afforded for the establishment in Palestine for those Jews who cannot or will not remain in the lands in which they live at present, will use its best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, and will be ready to consider any suggestions on the subject which any Jewish or Zionist organisations may desire to lay before it.&quot; . -^-S. I do not wish to limit the suggestions which are invited to the Zionist organisations.I should of course prefer that the Government as a Government should say nothing, but I do hope they will not go further than this.Yours sincerelv,Edwin S. Montagu.The Right Hon. Lord Robert Cecil, K.C., M.P.
