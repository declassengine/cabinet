t is the PropertysjoGtv&apos;s Government.)SECRET.,:Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information./CRW/023.WEEKLY REPORT ON RUSi.SIA. XXIII.(1 October, 1917).The past week has been quieter in Russia than most of its Immediate predecessors, and. in what can only be a lull before another tempestuous outbreak in internal politics, it may be worth while to attempt to review the situation.Internal Politics.One immediate result of the Korniloff episode was the strengthening of the Extreme Left, who felt themselves strong enough to summon a consultative meeting of the Democratic and Socialistic parties with a view to considering the question of the nature, and appointment, of a Government.      Conforming with this decision the Socialist members resigned from the Government, although agreeing to remain at their posts, and the Premier has been carrying on the actual government by means of a Directorate of Five, including no member either of the Extreme Left or the Cadet parties.    In addition, with the Left in view, the Premier proclaimed the Republic, and took up an aggressive attitude to the officers and troops implicated In the Korniloff affair, v/hich lost him the support of General Alexeieff.   Mth the Right in view, he issued demands for a return to the normal in army and fleet, together with the punishment of all who assassinated officers during the recent adventure and its accompaniments.      The already complicated situation has only been rendered more difficult to understand by the revelations of M. Savinkoff, former Assistant Minister of War, and others, which tend to shov; a certain mutual
measure of complicity between the Premier, Korniloff and others for the suppression of expected Bolshevik! opposition to an agreed programme of death penalty at the front and in the rear, militarisation of the railways and war Industries, and martial law in Petrograd and Moscow.       The projected institution of a sound and vigorous direction of affairs both at the front and in the rear seems in the end to have taken on the form of a counter-revolutionary plot, with Korniloff and Kerensky in sheep opposition - owing to misunderstandings in a telephone conversation, If tho reports may be believed.       Such opera-bouffe cannot have strengthened the already waning influence of the Premier.     It would seem, despite the reversed decisions of the Soviets favouring a Coalition Government although with the- exclusion of the Cadets, that the Democratic Conference may dictate terms for an entirely Socialist Government, which would make Kerensky1s continued tenure of the Premiership immensely difficult.Military Aspects.One of the first changes intimated by General Verhovsky, the new War Minister, is a reduction in tho stp^nding power of the army by the disbanding of some sixty divisions, as also of men over 40 years of age.        General Verhovsky promises at the same time that the number of actual fighting men, artillery and machine-guns will remain as before, and that it is the rean which will be primarily affected by the changes in question, which will also mean a very considerable war economy from the financial point of view, and a setting-free of mnny men for work on the land and in the munition and other factories, where there is a serious shortage of labour.
Congress of Nationalities.One other feature worthy of notice during the past week is the Congress of Nationalities held at Kieff, and attended by representative Georgians, Tatars, Don Cossacks, Letts, Lithuanians and Jews.      The principal aim of the Congress was the establishment of foundations for the free national development of all these nationalities.    It would seem as if the area of Intensest rivalry between the Great European Powers may gradually move as the result of the war from the Balkans further to the East:   and might be transferred to the Caucasus, Persiaj Asia Minor, and the Farther East, a circumstance which calls for keen study of the local situations and conditions.1.10.17.
