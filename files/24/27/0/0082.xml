SCHEME FOR A MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND OF THE FUNCTIONS TO BE TRANSFERRED TO IT.Introduction.1. We, the undersigned, in the course of the investigations and discussions in which we were engaged during July as to certain proposals for Maternity and Infant Welfare Legislation, found ourselves frequently impressed with the extent to which the difficulties of the problems involved in that question of local bodies&apos; powers are enhanced by the present unorganised condition of the Central Departments of Government for health purposes. We, therefore, thought it expedient to meet together at various times during August for discussion of this latter subject; and, after careful investigation and consideration,&quot;we have come to the conclusion that the establishment of a Ministry of Health, on the lines set out in the following Scheme,&apos; is urgently necessary, being indeed the only solution of those difficulties. We, therefore, submit the following Scheme to those bodies with whom we are respectively associated in National Health Insurance work; and, in order to elucidate the chief points involved, we have set out the main considerations which have led us to the conclusions on which the Scheme is based.2. The establishment of a Ministry of Health has become almost a catchword in many quarters, without, however, any clear statements having been forthcoming as to what kind of organisation, or what kind of a Department, is actually intended by the phrase. But our investigations have shown us that it is inherent in the very nature of this important question that, in any proposal to set up a Ministry of Health, several very varied problems are involved, any one of which maybe solved in various ways ; and the wisdom and probable effectiveness of any scheme must depend upon the particular features adopted in it. It is, in fact, a matter in which what may super-ficially be termed mere details will be found to constitute the crucial points of the problem, involving the essential conditions of any real subsequent success or progress for the nation.3. The present Memorandum is the outcome of a very careful and close considera-tion of the different elements in the problem, after careful analysis, and after investigation of the various functions of the different existing Government Depart-ments dealing in different ways with the health of the people, in the light of the main purposes needing to be provided for, the chief developments to be secured, and the more important pronouncements of Ministers and decisions of Parliament on the subject, both recently and in the last few years.The Purpose in View.4. It is apprehended that the purpose in view is to arrive at the best form of central Government machinery for securing due co-ordination of the present diverse activities for providing services for the health-of the community, together with the most promising possibilities for developing the same, with all possible safeguards for whatever has been found efficient in each of the several varying forms of organi-sation at present working; but conditioned and limited by &apos; the consideration of what is likely to be practicable at the present moment, under War conditions, with the Autumn Session of Parliament already somewhat congested, so that o\ly an -agreed Bill, of comparatively small dimensions, can wisely be looked for.5. It should be premised that the problem is one for England and ^Vales, the manner in which Scotland and Ireland may desire, if at all, to take up the matter being left to them.6. Considerable confusion of thought has prevailed in respect of the real subject under review, owing to a lack of appreciation of the essential difference between the activities of local bodies on the one hand, and what may be called the supervisory functions of the Central Departments of Government on the other. It is with the latter only that the present problem, properly speaking, is directly concerned; thato  (33)3854   Pk 469   125   9/17   e&amp;S &apos; A
is to say, what is to be set out is a description of a suitable Central Government Department to exercise supervisory and subsidising^ functions, in relation to various local bodies whose varying functions are determined by existing or other new legislation.7. The difficulty of the Central problem, however, is enhanced by the fact that a large part of the difficulties and defects most needing to be dealt with in the sphere of the health services of the community arise from the diversity of local bodies, some of which are already overlapping, but each of which has some special sphere in making provision for the health of the community ; and that a new arrangement of these local bodies is greatly needed, together with a big development of the at present restricted powers possessed even by all these local bodies, put together. . At the same time, the special mischief arising from the fact that locally the health needs of the community are thus being dealt with by several overlapping and competing bodies is o-reatly aggravated by the further fact that these several local bodies are in turn supervised&quot; and subsidised by different and diverse Central Departments, each of which is deemed by the public (rightly or wrongly) to be specially concerned to foster the &quot; interests &quot; and the development of the particular local body, which it is supposed to regard as peculiarly its client or its agent for its special form of health work.New Central Department needed. . .,i 8. It has, in fact, become increasingly clear, the more the question of&apos; developing the needed new local powers for health services-is investigated (a subject which we have also gone into very carefully), that a harmonious development of them cannot be obtained, nor the conflicting claims of the several local bodies to the new powers satisfactorily accommodated, unless and until this correlative conflict of divergent Central Departments is modified, and there has first been established one (and if possible only one) Central co-ordinating Department of the Government for Health purposes, -which should be in charge of a Minister of Cabinet rank. A very careful and prolonged study of both parts of this problem has convinced us that the reform and unification of the Central organisation is imperatively necessary before the needed developments of local powers can properly or safely be entered upon.9. One practical illustration (out of many that might be given) may show why this is so in regard to Health matters. The workings of any given local body depend very considerably upon the directions and instigation of some Central Department, and particularly upon the subsidies of Exchequer money that are given to it by that Department. So long as Exchequer subsidies are disbursed by several Central Departments on several divergent principles, to several local bodies, there is obviously an absence of that one unifying directive influence which is essential to properly co-ordinated local efforts, but which is obtainable only when there is one single source of this Exchequer-subsidy influence.The proper Composition of the new Department.10. The converse, however, of this argument equally needs to be remembered, if mischief is to be avoided in effecting the reform centrally by any drastic unifying project. For instance, to put out of existence all but one of the existing Central Departments, in order to obtain the desired single unity of direction, would only be a disastrous solution, if the one Central Department thus remaining were not possessed of the requisite experience and knowledge of the diverse methods, .spirit, and characteristics of each of-the various local bodies whose respective activities are then to be directed, supervised, and subsidised by the one Central Department.11. A Central Department that was cognisant, by its past history, of only one of the diverse local health services, or was ignorant of any particular one of the several essential local services, would certainly, in all its subsequent directive and subsidising activities, effect much havoc upon whichever local service was not within its previous cognisance ; and grave mischief would thereby result to the particular existing service thus affected ; moreover, such a Department would obviously fail from the outset to enlist the confidence of the particular local body or bodies to which it would, be alien in spirit.12. It will thus be seen that the question of the different elements to be comprised within the new Ministry of Health, and the nature of the organisation to be given to it, is one of supreme importance, and a satisfactory clearly defined solution of it an essential condition precedent of any rational support of a scheme; so that the
Existing Departments affected.13. This, then, it would seem, must be the main consideration as regards the proper composition of the new Ministry, looked at from the point of view of developing efficiently the different existing local health activities for the community. Now the chief local organisations at present working for the health of the community and providing various services for it are (a) the local Sanitary Authorities under the Public Health Acts, 1875, and onwards, providing various public health services within (medically speaking) somewhat narrow restrictions which the Local Government Board is just now wanting to get Parliament to modify ; (ft) the Insurance Committees established by Parliament in 1911, which provide medical services of various kinds for the Avhole of the working population ; (c) the Poor Law Guardians, with their infirmaries and medical officers ; (d) the Local Ed acation Authorities as regards the health &quot;of children;, and (e) the newly established Local Pensions Committees for providing special medical services for discharged disabled sailors and soldiers. It would, therefore, appear that at all events each one of the existing Central Departments which are respectively responsible to Parliament for the direction and subsidising of these several activities must, if possible, be brought into the new Ministry, in some degree, at all events, i.e., the Local G-overnment Board, the Health Insurance Commissioners, the Board of Education, and the Ministry of Pensions.14. But there are also other existing Central Government Departments having important functions in respect of certain parts of the problem of the health of the community, e.g., the Home Office, looking after the health of factory workers, with its. recently developed activities (in concert with the Ministry of Munitions) for the &quot;welfare&quot; of munition workers; the Prrvy Council Office in its relation to the General Medical Council and the Pharmaceutical Society, and particularly in its relation to Midwives ;, and the Board of Control with its important supervisory-functions in respect of the mental health of the community, the lunatic asylums, the mentally defective, and so forth.15. When, however, the problem is seriously considered of forthwith bringing together, for the reasons above indicated, the Health functions of each one of these many existing Government Departments into one new unified whole, so as to form the Ministry of Health, it is found that the difficulties involved in so comprehensive a solution are too great to admit of any possibility of attainment under present conditions of war problems and congested Parliamentary time-table, as indicated earlier in this Memorandum.how far existing departments can be combined.16. The problem, therefore, becomes one of determining, by close scrutinv, (a) which of these various existing central functions are certainly indispensable to*a Ministry of Health, in the sense of being of such a nature that for the new Depart-in ent not to be possessed of them, from the outset, would make it aai absurdity, and not really a Ministry of Health at all; and. then (6) of determining what other functions of Central Departments are of such a. nature that they clearly ought to be part of the Ministry of Health, but their inclusion can be deferred for a time, if theA 2opposition to an ill-constructed scheme or (still more) to a wholly vague scheme, is plainly a public duty, and must not necessarily be deemed to be (as has been unjustifiably alleged) occasioned merely by the efforts of particular financial or other vested interests endeavouring in some way to obtain for themselves a nefarious domina-tion over the new regime. Such opposition, or such efforts, may be directed solely to resisting the adoption of any ill-considered project for the creation of a Ministry, which might in its realisation have lacked some of the essential characteristics of an efficient Health Department, and would then have gravely damaged some of the most vital elements in the health -organisations of the community. Our own efforts are directed solely to attempting to secure (as must clearly be right) that each one of the several efficient factors in the existing complex supply of services for the health of the community shall be suitably preserved and developed to-the full, and given its proper part in procuring the needed developments in a duly co-ordinated scheme in each locality, under the directive influence of a sufficiently composite but properly unified Central Department adequately cognisant of each of the several factors.
difficulties of immediate transference are too great, on the understanding that they must certainly be brought in at the earliest practicable moment; and then (c) of determining what further functions of Central Departments should ultimately be brought in, but at such later period as may be found expedient.17. A wise decision as to which one of these three categories must be deemed to be the right one for any given central function is difficult, and depends on several considerations. In reaching it, regard must be had (i) to the size and the nature of the difficulties and the controversies involved in disentangling a particular function from its present centre ; (ii) to the possible psychological effects of its inclusion on the one hand or its exclusion on the other upon the public mind, and upon such prejudices or sentiments as may be rife in regard to it; and (iii) to the important consideration of the possibility of securing an effective practical working of the new Department in the highly important first few months of its existence when it will be on trial, but when at the same time several highly complex problems of great urgency will demand its immediate attention. It would seem wise, therefore, having regard to the urgent need of steps being taken forthwith, to err on the side of including too few rather than too many different kinds of functions at the outset, so as not to call on the Ministry to attempt too many things during the first few months after its first establishment.18. If these be granted as the main, indeed the determinative, considerations to be had in view in framing the best composition for the new Ministry, it will tend to conciseness in this Memorandum if the reasons for the inclusion or exclusion of particular functions and Departments in the new Ministry, as proposed in the present Scheme, are not set out at length, but the description confined to a statement of the functions deemed necessary (on the above grounds) for inclusion (A) at the outset, or (B) at the earliest possible moment, or (C) at some later stage ; with a brief note, perhaps, of the reasons for not attempting at the outset some particular matters which might have seemed desirable in a proper system on general principles of sound public health organisation, but which on particular grounds may be found for the time being impossible.19. In outline, then, the Scheme we find to be best, on the above considerations, is that the main factors in the new Ministry, to be comprised in it from the outset, should be a combination of the existing Public Health functions (with some important exceptions) of the Local Government Board; the functions (both as to medical and as to financial matters) of the National Health Insurance Commissioners for &quot;England and AVales; the Maternity and Infant Welfare functions of the Board of Education; the Midwifery functions of the Privy Council Office; and the new functions in respect of the care and supervision of the Blind to be set going in accordance with the Report of the recent Departmental Committee, which indicated the Ministry of Health as the proper Department for this purpose.20. Nextly, that from the outset, or, if this be found to be too difficult, then at the earliest moment possible, there should be brought in the following: viz., certain other Public Health functions of the Local Government Board; the Board of Education functions in respect of Creches; the functions of the Registrar General (i.e., vital statistics, &amp;c.); the Home Office functions as to inspection of factories and the appointment of certifying surgeons under the Factory Acts ; and the functions of the Board of Control (i.e., care of the insane and mentally defective).21. Lastly, that there should be brought into the new Ministry, at whatever stage may be found - most expedient, the remaining Public Health functions of the Local Government Board, particularly Housing; the same Departments supervision (subject to what is said below) of what has hitherto been known as the medical side of the Poor Law; the supervision of the treatment of discharged disabled sailors and soldiers, at present under the Ministry of Pensions ; and the remaining Health functions of the Privy Council Office.Temporary Arrangements.22. It may be mentioned here that such of the functions, whether of the Local Government Board or of other Departments, as are to be transferred to the Ministry at later stages can best be so transferred by means of successive Orders in Council thus avoiding the trouble of having to resort to further legislation at each further stage!
The Bill establishing the Ministry of Health should contain a Clause authorising the making of such Orders in Council for these purposes, just as was provided in Section 2 of the Board of Education Act, 1899, Section 2 of. the Ministry of Munitions Act, 1915, and Section 2 of the New Ministries and Secretaries Act of 1916, in the case of the Ministry of Labour, for transferring various functions gradually to those Departments.23. Looked at from the point of view of existing Departments, it will be seen that the scheme postulates that, for the present, the Health functions of some of the various Government Departments concerned shall continue unaltered; and that those of the Board of Education shall be altered and transferred to so limited an extent that it need involve no material alteration of the organisation of that Depart-ment; but the proposed transference of functions from the Local Government Board and the National Health Insurance Commissioners involves certain matters that perhaps need further explanation.24. We assume that those functions of the Local Government Board which for various reasons we think should not at the outset be transferred to the new Ministry will continue to be exercised by that Board for the transitional period. Some other f unctions of that Board, however, are of a nature so alien to the predominant purpose of the new Ministry, which is the development of Public Health, that their inclusion, even at any later period, would render its functions too heterogeneous to be efficiently exercised by the one Health Ministry, though they may for that very reason be all the more effectively administered in future (after the Health functions have been transferred) by the&apos;Local Government Board itself.Difficulties as to Poor Law.25. Perhaps, therefore, the first criticism which, from the local authorities&apos; point of view, will be levelled against this Scheme, and which may best be dealt with at this point, is that it involves what will be called the break-up of the Local Government Board ; and the main element, we realise, in this criticism, will undoubtedly be concentrated upon the proposal that, whilst transferring many of its health functions; we leave out of the new Ministry from the outset all the functions of that Department in respect of the Poor Law, though these include (as we are aware) several important health services, e.g., the provision of medical attendance at home for the medically destitute, the poor law infirmaries and hospitals in all parts of the country, and other analogous services. We fully admit that the exclusion from the Ministry of Health of the central supervision and direction of these important elements in local medical services is greatly to be deprecated from the point of view of administrative co-ordination ; and in accordance with the principles of the Scheme we feel strongly that this supervisory function too must be brought into the new Ministry directly certain other changes, e.g., the expected reform of local Poor Law administration, render it possible for this io be done without necessarily bringing with it into the Ministry of Health (as we understand cannot in present circumstances be avoided) the supervision of all Poor Law Relief. But we feel even more strongly that, so long as the central supervision of the one must carry also the central supervision of the other, to exclude the medical side is the only course possible under present circumstances. The reason for this is that the new Ministry of Health would be condemned from the outset in the eyes of practically all that part of the population that is most concerned, if all the great new health activities which its establishment is to inaugurate were to be associated, at its very centre, with all the prejudice, the odium, and the dislike, at present inseparably connected in the public mind with the very name of Poor Law. We earnestly hope that the Government will bring about as soon as possible the long overdue reforms of the Poor Law (long since fully explored by Royal Commissions), so that the whole of the local medical services of the community in any given area shall be brought under one co-ordinated local jurisdiction, when it will at once become possible and right for their central supervision to be concentrated under one Department at the centre, i.e., in the Ministry of Health.Questions affecting National Health Insurance.26. Having thus dealt, perhaps, sufficiently with certain effects of our Scheme in relation to the Local Government Board, it remains to consider such points thato  3854 , o
are raised by it as may need special adjustment in respect of National Health. Insurance. After careful consideration we think there are only two that need be mentioned, for both of which a satisfactory solution can readily be arranged.27. The first is that, since it is essential, in our view, for the new Ministry of Health to be established by Parliament under a Minister responsible to Parliament for the working of his Department, it follows that the powers and duties of the Health Insurance Commissioners must be transferred by the Bill (with an exception to be named presently) to that Minister. Under the National Insurance Act, 1911, the right of decision and action in all matters within the jurisdiction of the Central Department appeared to be vested in the Insurance Commissioners. We understand, however, that, as intimated by Mr. Masterman and Mr. Lloyd George in answers to Parliamentary Questions on 29th February, 1912, and 29th January, 1913, and by Mr. Masterman in his Estimates Speech in Parliament on 18th April, 1912, the exercise of these powers and duties by the Commissioners, except in judicial or quasi-judicial matters, has always in fact been subject to the control and direction of a Minister of the Crown, responsible to the Cabinet and to Parliament, and has not been within the unfettered competence of the Commission or its staff, any more than obtains in this respect in other Government Departments. The proposed transference, therefore, will, in these circumstances, involve no such change in this respect as might otherwise have been supposed. It will, however, in our view, mean, since the Bill puts the Minister in the place of the English Insurance Commission, that two important matters must be provided for by the Scheme, in order that there may be a continuance of those special safeguards for Health Insurance work which its particular nature renders permanently necessary, and which were for that reason specially accorded by the Government and by Parliament in the legislation of 1911, when the various Approved Societies were brought into the new national organisation, and made an integral part of the State machinery for Health Insurance purposes.28. These two matters, we think, after careful consideration and discussion, can best be provided for as follows : The Bill creating the new Ministry, when transferring to it the powers and duties of the Insurance Commission for England, and substituting the Minister for the Commissioners, who become, with their staff, officials of the new Ministry, should contain two specific provisions ; firstly, that in the exercise of the functions so transferred to the Minister, he (and, of course, his Department) shall constantly have advice and guidance from a special body to be appointed for the purpose by Order in Council, comprising persons having practical experience of National Health Insurance work ; this body is needed to provide as far as possible in the new regime that special practical knowledge and experience for its Insurance administration, which was secured in the Governments original scheme for the working of National Health Insurance in 1911. Secondly, the Bill should provide that the judicial and quasi-judicial powers and duties of the Insurance Commissioners shall not be transferred to the Minister, but shall be vested in, and exercised by, a special body, to be appointed for the purpose by Order in Council, whose decisions on these matters shall be final, and not subject to review by the Minister or (except as under Section 66 of the Act of 1911) by any Court of Law ; an arrangement which would, we understand, be in conformity with the present practice and the conditions established under the Act of 191.1 and the Treasury Minute referred to in paragraph 27 above.29. We have discussed at some length the question of the particular matters which should be placed within the category of this second proviso, i.e., those reserved from the Ministers jurisdiction; and we are clear that they must include at least all matters arising under Sections 66 and 07 of the Act of 1911 (with such strictly analogous matters in that or later Insurance Acts as would conse-quentially go with these) and also, we are inclined to think, the power of granting and withdrawing the approval given under Section 23 of the Act of 1911 in respect of particular Friendly Societies, or Trade Unions, or Industrial Assurance Companies or other bodies administering 0r desiring to administer National Health Insurance as Approved Societies.Wales.30. The only other points of importance needing consideration are the questions of ^ Wales, Scotland and Ireland; and, in connection with these, the question of the Joint Committee under Section 83 of the Act of 1911.   As regards Wales, the Scheme
would for the present presumably make much the same provision as for England, merging the Welsh Insurance Commission in the new Ministry, as in paragraph 27 above, but making provision for the possibility of further developments later on. In all other respects the arrangements would conform to the conditions specified in the two preceding paragraphs ; in any case, however, it would probably be expedient to retain a special Administrative Office in Cardiff, in which the existing Commis-sioners and staff would continue to work as officials of the new Ministry; and this Office could gradually be developed (if desired) into a Welsh Department of the Ministry of Health.Scotland and Ireland.31. The cases of Scotland and Ireland raise a somewhat different problem, which we have to some extent considered, because we realise that its satisfactory solution must be a condition precedent to any establishment of a Ministry of Health for England and Wales, but on which we prefer to offer no specific proposal as to the right solution, as we believe that Scotland and Ireland will prefer to work out their own arrangements for Health Insurance and for a Health Ministry in their own way on whatever lines they may deem most suited to their particular conditions, to their existing Insurance Commission and Local Government Board arrangements, and to their respective national needs generally.32. We, therefore, confine ourselves, in this matter, to pointing out that our Scheme does not necessitate any material modification in the Scottish or the Irish Insurance Commissions; it will be necessary merely to make some provision in the Bill (in whatever manner may prove at once most agreeable to the Scottish&apos; and Irish susceptibilities and compatible with the necessities of the new situation) for securing adequate interchange and co-ordination of Health Insurance work (especially in finance) between the several countries, and a sufficient continuance under the new circumstances of the kind of international comity and co-operation at present achieved by means of the Joint Committee under Section 83 of the Act of 1911. If, for example, it were thought desirable (perhaps as a temporary measure until larger changes could be developed after the war) that the Secretary for Scotland should be declared by a new Treasury Minute to be the Minister responsible for the admini-strative work of the Scottish Insurance Commission (instead of, as at present, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster or the Comptroller of the Household), and the Chief Secretary for Ireland similarly for the Irish Commission, then these two Ministers and the new Minister of Health could be appointed by the Treasury under Section 83 of the Act of 1911 to be members of a new Joint Committee, for the requisite co-ordination of Health Insurance work in all the parts of the United Kingdom, on much the same lines as the present arrangements under the Act of 1911. But any suggestion of this kind should be discussed of course with Scottish and Irish representatives, which we have not sought to do in framing the present Scheme, as we are dealing with England and Wales only.Further Considerations.33. Having thus, as we &quot;hope, explained the main features (set out concisely in summary form below) of what we consider the necessary form of a Ministry of Health which shall achieve the purpose in view and avoid creating mischief to any of the important elements in our complex English life, we would beg leave, in conclusion, to name three considerations which we regard as of vital necessity for the satisfactory working of such a Scheme, and which we should earnestly hope would be stated by the Government to be integral parts of whatever legislation they introduce on this subject.Imperative Need of Forward Policy.Three Points needed.34. The first is that the plan is to be regarded and to be announced as a practical expression of the fixed determination of the Government and of Parliament that forward steps of the most effective kind are immediately to be taken for the improve-ment of health services generally in all parts of England and Wales without waitingA 4
for the end of the war; indeed, on the contrary, to have things ready before that time. It must be insisted that the present gravely inadequate provision for the health of the people shall be reformed, especially as regards maternity and infant welfare, but on no account in respect only of these ; that the present deplorable deficiencies of particular kinds of medical services, alike in our existing Health Insurance organisation and under Local Authorities, shall forthwith be made good; that unwilling authorities, obstructive interests, and reactionary influences, shall be effectively dealt with, their powers being given to others, if needs be, so as to secure that due progress shall be achieved. It is also necessary that the purpose and the statutory duty of the new Ministry of Health shall be, and shall be declared to be, an effective direction and stimulation of all such steps as shall promote the health and physical well-being of the people, and the encouragement and co-ordination of all measures conducive thereto, including the prevention and cure of diseases, the spread of public knowledge on these matters, and the gradual creation of such an environment as shall enure to the steady diminution (instead of, as at present, to the increase) of all avoidable causes of human suffering and waste generally.35. Our second point, as a means of achieving the first one, is that the Bill establishing the Ministry of Health shall give to it all such powders (even of an unprecedented nature for a Govermnent Department if needs be) as may be requisite for enabling it actually to bring about these great changes as much in the poor and heavily burdened areas where the need is greatest but movement most slow, as in the affluent or progressive areas which move more readily of themselves ; following the lines of progress so inspiringly set out in the great Budget speech of 4th May, 1914, by the then Chancellor of the Exchequer; and, specially must wTe add, for the reasons Mr. Lloyd George then indicated, that the Bill shall therefore be accompanied by substantial annual grants from the Exchequer to be disbursed by the new Ministry in the promotion of well-devised and j^roperly co-ordinated local schemes of health developments by the several local bodies in every area, rural and urban, throughout England and Wales. This is admitted to be necessary as an accompaniment of the new Education Bill, but it is infinitely more necessary in the sphere of health, because the part played by the Exchequer in health matters has for the 50 years preceding 1911 been so extraordinarily meagre that the tardiness of local effort has perhaps hardly been unnatural in the circumstances.36. And lastly, again as a means of accomplishing the foregoing, we must urge that the Ministry of Health Bill shall be accompanied or immediately followed (but shall on no account be preceded) by a suitable correlative measure, an enabling measure, giving new powers to the various local bodies (on the lines of our other report dealing with certain maternity and infant welfare proposals) for providing all kinds of medical and analogous services for the people, alike in rural and in urban areas, on lines indicated and subsidised for the purpose by the new Ministry. For it is our conviction, which wre would wish most earnestly to press now upon the Government in this connection, that there is nothing which is so greatly needed in England at the present juncture as the inauguration of new health services on a properly systematised, centrally directed plan of campaign, nothing which it is so important to establish before the innumerable difficulties are upon us which must necessarily follow immediately upon the declaration of peace and the vast demobilisation of industrial and military forces, however gradually this be accom-plished. Our conviction is that whether it be in relation to the pressing problems of infant mortality, of the welfare of nursing and expectant mothers, of the industrial inefficiency of a population weakened by needless sickness, or to the present lack of any organised machinery in England with co-ordinated powers for combating the multiplicity of health problems that follow inevitably in the wake of diminished food and other sequelae of a world-war-it has become the very first duty of the Government to take such steps now as will enable the requisite legislative and administrative measures (which can be achieved in so small a compass), to be taken in hand at the beginning of the Autumn Session, so that they shall have reached the Statute Book and the new Ministry. 9hall have been established and sufficiently inaugurated for practical purposes by Christmas, and thus the gravely needed new developments shall be able to be commenced (as wall certainly not otherwise be possible) by the beginning of 1918.
SUMMARY OF SCHEME.(i) A Bill to. be brought in at the beginning of the Autumn Session which shall establish a Ministry of Health in charge of a Minister, of Cabinet rank, with the specific duty and mandate indicated in paragraph 31 above, for securing proper health measures and conditions throughout England and Wales.(ii) The Bill to transfer from the outset to the new Ministry, in manner shown in paragraphs 27 and 28, aU the functions, other than judicial and quasi-judicial, of the Insurance Commissioners for England and for Wales, the excepted functions being transferred to a special body to be set up by Order in Council.(iii) To transfer also to it from the outset all the more directly medical functions of the Local Government Board under the Public Health Acts, and at a later stage its other functions under those Acts, but none of its functions under the Poor Law until certain other changes have first been made.(iv) To transfer also to it from the outset the functions of the Board of Education as regards Maternity and Infant Welfare, and later on in respect of Creches.(v) To transfer to it from the outset the functions of the Privy Council in respect of Midwives, and, later on, its other medical or analogous functions.-(vi) To transfer to it at a later stage the functions of the Registrar-General; certain functions of the Home Office ; and those of the Board of Control for Lunacy.(vii) The Bill to authorise Orders in Council for making these later transferences, and also for setting up special bodies for carrying on certain special functions at present fulfilled by the Insurance Commissioners for England and Wales, especially in the judicial sphere.(viii) The Bill to authorise any changes in respect of the Joint Committee for National Health Insurance that may be found consequentially necessary or desirable as regards Scotland or Ireland, or in respect of the relations between those parts of the Kingdom and England and A*Vales concerning Health Insurance, especially on the financial side.(ix) The Bill to be accompanied by substantial Exchequer Grants to be disbursed by the Ministry of Health for promoting schemes of various local bodies to be empowered thereto by subsequent or concurrent, but not by any preceding, legislation.(x) The scheme as a whole to be introduced in October and to be pressed with the utmost possible urgency and strenuousness by the Government with a view to its coming into effective practical working by the beginning of 1918.FRANCIS ASKEW,ARTHUR R.
