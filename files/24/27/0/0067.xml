Colonel Jones*1--- WAR CA3I1CT,Conscientious Objector.s,t110/Gen.kO j/3319.Memorandum byi the Secretary of State for War. -She War Cabinet will remember -hat 1 circulated on 21st August last a memorandum G.2.1799 describing an interview General Childs and I had had withKr. Asquith and iar. McKenna on the subject of Conscientious Objectors,   Since then the Cabinet has had a note on the subject from Lord Kilner, and I have Just received from Lord Salisbury a copy of a memorandum which he sent to the Home Secretary when resigning his position as Chairman of the Central Appeal Tribunal and which is reproduced in an Appendix.   It is certain that the matter wiJl be raised at the opening of Parliament, and it is essential that some decision should be arrived at with regard to the future treatment of Conscientious objectors, either by maintaining the status quo, or else &quot;oy some form of legislation which would give effect to Ur. Asquithfs views.I should lilce to suggest to the War Cabinet that a meeting be held at which representatives of the War Office and Home Office., should be present, and which Lord Salisbury, and, if it v?ere thought &quot;desirable, lir. Asquith should be aslced to attend; a member of the War Cabinet might preside and as the question is tt a great extent a legal one, I would suggest that Sir Edward Carson, if he be willing to accept, should be the Chairman,   He could then report to the Cabinet.2BB3T.^9.9.17.
Lord Salisbury&apos;g Ueiooranctam on the Treatment of ConscientiousObjectors.&apos;   Hy connection with the Central Tribunal is drawing to a close but before I leave it I am anxious to recapitulate to you for whatever they are worth the conclusions which 2 have farmed as to the treatment of Conscientious Objectors.1.    The most essential thing is an authoritative declaration either by the Government or if^it is thought better by the High Court that no Conscientious Objector is entitled to absolute exemption.   As I understand the law if an applicant is found to have a conscientious objection to combatant service he is entitled to relief, but the extent of the relief is&apos;left to the discretion of the Tribunal.   It may be absolute exemption if the Tribunal so decide,   3ut that is a matter entirely for the Tribunal - the applicant has no rji^it to it whatever.   An appeal is ?uade to the alleged intent ion &quot;of Parlia?nent on this point as shewn in statements by Ministers during the passage of the Kilitary Service Act.   These I need not say do not bind the Tribunal,   3ut in a matter of this kind I think it would be pedantic to treat them as of no authority. The quotations however ^hich I have seen appear to have been principally directed against the charge that notwithstanding the terms of the Act a man might still be forced against his conscience t0 5.^r5^^..:dL..Ai2J!!ii J   an^ 0* oourse it is agreed that wherever Tribunals have done this they have erred not only against these statements but against the Act of parliament itself.   There is however no sign that these Ministerial speakers even in the fervour of their eloquence were suggesting that an objector must, not be compelled to do alternative service of national importance.An appeal is also made to the declaratory section in the second Military Service Act.   It will be remembered that in a oase before the High Court as to a Conscientious Objector who had been awarded conditional exemption a Judge in an obiter dictum suggested a doubt whether a Conscientious Objector was entitled to anything exoepi, exemption from combatant service or exemption conditional on doing ^vork of national importance, and it was therefore thought necessary in the second Act to make it clear that exe;.ntion on the ground of conscientious objection may be of a like character to exemption on any other ground, including absolute exemption, in add:tljcn to the forms of exemption which are specially attached to censcj entious objection under the principal Act.   ITo doubt under this provision absolute exemption is a recognised award in the case ci a Conscientious Objector as in any other case, but this was intended to add nothing to the effect of the first Act.   ilo Ccnsci oitious Objector therefore is ejr^J^led to absolute exemption and it is most important that they sKould&quot;&quot;all understand this, since a conviction that they have been defrauded of a right leads to a great deal of the friction which is subsequently developed.&quot;iut if a Conscientious Objector has no grievance because he does not obtain absolute exemption; he has a grievance in many cases in respect of the difference of treatment under the Pelharo uom-aj.ctoe and under the ^race committee.   If under the ordinary jurisdiction of the Tribunals an applicant found to have a genuine consoiem-i ous objection is given exemption conditional on doing work of national importance - generally speaking supervised by thePelham
Pelham Committee - lie is within bread- limits a fi^*e..jnan,--earning .-regular wages in a position to which no disgrace or quasi, penal    &apos;/j oharactey is attached.... But if the Tribunals make a mi stake and-, he is not found to have a genuine conscientious objection until;&apos;&apos; he has been compelled to join the Arary,  qeen court-martialed^ been sent \9 Wormwood Spjubs and there been brought before&apos; the Central tribunal, then instead of being restored to the position which he would have occupied if the Tribunals had been right&apos; instead of ^song he passes under the administration of the Brace Gommi&amp;tee where he is neither free nor paid, except a trifle,and undergoes semi-penal treatment.   I am disposed indeed to think that the conditions imposed by the Pelham Committee are often too favourable, but there is and can be no defence for the distinction^ in the treatment of bodies of Conscientious Objectors presumably equally genuine - though there may properly be a distinction in the treatment of individual cases,   :3y this last phrase I mean that it may be very right and proper that particular Conscientious Objectors who may be expected to use their freedom for anti-war purposes should be placed under restrictions somewhat similar in quality to what they would experience had they not had a conscientious objection and had been serving in the Amy.   I would therefore give a wide discretion to the Coiamit+e&apos;5 to determine the incidents of the work of national importance wHIdh should be assigned to different Conscientious Objectors according to the circumstances of each case, but the general harsher treatment tf men Merely because they have been wrongly imprisoned should be put an end to.3.     There is one more change which I venture to thin): would oil the machinery,   I would get rid of all connection with the Army in the Home Office scheme.     At present the man working under the Home Office scheme re:nains in Section V/, of the Reserve - a dormant connection with the Army, of no effect it is true unless the man misbehaves, but standing as it does upon the face of the terms of the scheme it gives an occasion for the scrupulous consciences with which we have to deal to conceive that their exemption from any connection with the Army is after all a fraud. The reason of this remnant of the Army in the scheme is that without it there would be no means of enforcing discipline of any kind, for the only sanction which the officials have to enforce their orders is the power to send the man back into the Army, But it is a clumsy method and militates against the success&apos;of the scheme,   Pull civil control should be established and the necessary legislation passed with that object.   It would not be difficult to* frame a measure giving the Inspectors the powers of a Magistrate with certain penalties which they could award in cases of disobedience to regulations,4.     It is hoped that if the foregoing suggestions were adopted the number of absolutists would to some extent be diminished 3ut the remainder would still present a formidable difficulty. These would continue to refuse the Home Office scheme and must, (perhaps after a second or third conviction), be kept in prison till the end of the war.   There is not much sympathy probably for those of them whose objection is moral rather than religious&quot;and is mingled in greater or lass degree with the political object of breaking down the Military Service Act.   3ut a large number of the absolutists are religious and intensely genuine and I doubt whether public opinion ^ill in the long run be satisfied that these men of high character and lofty alms should be kept for many months undergoing the severest punishment assigned to ordinary criminals. Llany of them are neurotics and I am surprised that the Prison doctors nave not found that for reasons cx health the punishmentshould
should be modified.   But however that may be I feel confident that whether these wens1 health has suffered or not it is a dangerous thing by ^hat my be considered persecution to enlist the sympathy of a great bod;/ of religious opinion on the side of the opponents of Military service, and that some kind of mitigation is urgently required.   I do not pretend that I have been able to find any logical method of meeting xiie difficulty, but at any irate if all Conscientious Objectors -who are imprisoncd either under a first or cumulatively by reason of a second sentence   for more than four months were to&apos;*&apos;oe transferred by administrative order to the tfirst Division their treatment would be brought into line with a large number of precedents of cases of persons who have, brolcen the law and must therefore be punished but have broken it under circumstances to which no disgrace is attached.5,     To sum up what i3 required is &apos;:-1.    A declaration that&apos; there is no right of absolute exemption..2,     An amalgamation of the ISrace. Committee.and the Pelham. Committee with wide discretionary powers in their hands..3.    Legislation to establish full civilian control with civil penalties in the case of insubordina-ion.::4.     And lastly the transfer to the ilrst Division of all Conscientious Objectors who have been in prison altogether for more than four months&apos;.(Initld.)   S.
