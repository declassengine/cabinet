The members of the Board approached the matter in no &quot;spirit of personal interest, but as practical men applying their judgment to the problem of the fullest utilisation and development of the industry in the National interests.It was felt that they had not sufficient information as to what the Government required by way,of shipbuilding out-put or as to .what the Government intended to do, to enable them to form a conclusive opinion.   Ab the subject, however, is one of such considerable importance they desire to ask that they may be informed on both these points, and may be given an opportunity to discuss the matter more fully with you.   This request they make with the fullest desire to be helpful and in the belief that they can be helpful. .Meantime: they desire to make the following observa-tione- &apos;&quot;? .1* At the present time,, in.spite of the efforts of the &apos;*Government Departments concerned:, existing shipyards : are so far short of supplies both of labour and of material that the output is. only, approximately, two-thirds of what it should be.   It is presumed that the Government now sees its way to obtain adequate supplies of both labour and material.
2. Many shipyards are finding great, difficulty in pro-curing the necessary replacements in plant and machinery, or additional plant and machinery.5. A special enquiry made by the Federation, frhcwsthat - given the necessary Government assistance -well over 100 additional berths can be laid down by existing shipyards, if desired.4, A much more rapid and economical increase of outputwould be obtained - and at earlier date -by affording every facility for the laying down of additional berths in existing yards than by establishing new National. shipyards; the former course should therefore have first consideration.5. Proper provision for adequate and efficient 6taffs,managers, foreman and other essential officials in the new National Shipyards: can only be made by taking men from existing shipyards which are already suffering from understaffing owing to war conditions.    Indeed this process of &quot;drawing&quot; has begun, and the ultimate effect of it must be to lessen the efficiency and out-put of existing shipyards.6, It is not known within what period the GovernmentJb. is expecting the fullest development of shipbuilding resources to become operative, but if the period is within 12 or 18 months then it is, in the opinion of the- Board, impossible that the equipment of both the additional berths referred to and National Shipyards can be effectively carried out simultaneously.It is a cause of great satisfaction to the Board thatthe whole subject of shipbuilding facilities should be re-ceiving the closest attention of the Government and they trustthat you will arrange to meet a deputation from theFederation at an early date so that the matter may be. ..discussed from every stand-point.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sgd) A.R. Duncan.Secretary..The Rt. Hon. D. Lloyd George, M.P., 10, Downing Street, S.W.  (1)
