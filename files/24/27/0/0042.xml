DEPARTMENT OP INFORMATION        4.7j gK C\     -si ^ vi u\k &apos;y ;  j INTELLIGENCE BUREAU.- WEEKLY    REPORT    ON    GERMANY.27 September, 1917-.1.      The most important event of the week is the publica-tion of:the German reply to the Pope&apos;s Peace Note.     Apart from the cynical hypocrisy, characteristic of the present regime in peace as well as in war time, it is remarkable for its studied vagueness with regard to German War Aims.    Further light may be throtto on the situation by the speech which the Chancellor is to deliver apparently to the Main Committee of the Reichstag, not the Reichstag Itself, today.The reply is professedly based on the so-called peace resolution passed by the Reichstag on July 19;   in this and in the plausible language used about disarmament and arbi-tration, we can no doubt see the influence of the new Reichstag Committee;   but it will be noted that what is said is so care-fully guarded that any definite engagement is avoided and there is no guarantee that without a decisive breakdown Germany would really follow up the suggestions about arbitration, disarmament, etc., all of which are completely alien to her ways of thinking and acting.2.      It would be a mistake to suppose that because the document is so vaguely worded and because it contains no refer-enoe to definite conditions of peace, that this is the last word the German Government has.to say.    The whole procedure of the Papal Note has probably been arranged beforehand.     It is anti-cipated that the Pope will answer the German Note by another with a definite enquiry as to other points, especially as to Belgium, and the German Government has deliberately adopted
this method of procedure in order to gain time and test thediplomatic situation, while, at the same time, it Is seekingto guide German public opinion through the press.    The Baslergachriohten, a leading Swiss newspaper, which often receivesinspired communications from Berlin - indeed it could notreceive any communications from Germany unless they passed astrict Foreign Office censorship - published at the end of lastweek a letter from its Berlin Correspondent, who said:-&quot;The Pope will be able, after the receipt of the German reply, to address to Berlin the question whether Germany&apos;s readiness on principle to negotiate on the basis of her Note refers also to Belgium, and the answer will be in the affir-fflative.nIn this connection it is noteworthy that Herr vongflhlmann, Foreign Secretary, went to Munich and delivered thetoldnote in person to the Papal Nuncio there, and as we are/in one paper,discussed the Belgian questions with him.3.   There is much evidence that a further pronouncement on Belgium is being planned;   German papers during the week have been full of discussions on the Belgian question, and it is quite clear - as has already been pointed out - that herr von Ktthlmann, who is an adept at this kind ox thing, has got the press into what he would consider better order than it was under his predecessors.    The official inspiration to the press quite clearly takes the form that Germany is willing to surrender Belgium on condition that the Allies renounce all territorial and economic conquest at the expense of Germany or her Allies;   that is, if Germany gives up Belgium, she will require Great Britain to restore all the German Colonies, and in addition, Mesopotamia, and also to give up any project of economic blockade.     In addition to this, in spite of Lichnow-skyfs assurance of August 4, 1914, the restoration of the in-dependenqe of Belgium would be conditioned by the jxrovision &quot;that the right of existence is assured to the various na-
tloiiaXirtl&amp;a wrrfeh inhabit that country-, and that guarantees for the genuine neutrality of Belgium are subsequently dis-cussed&quot;.    This is found in articles circulated by WolffJ^s Agency and also, in other words, in tbe Frankfurter and Kglniscbe Zeitung.      This meanB an arrangement which would give Germany the right, based on an international treaty, to interfere in the internal affairs of Belgium;   that is, Belgium would not be a country with full international status, but would be degraded to the position in which Turkey v/as when Eussia had the right to protect the Christian subjects of the oQuart,4.   It is noticeable also that the Catholic Press have been giving great prominence to the Belgian question.     In interpreting this we must remember two things, first that they are strongly hostile to Great Britain, and secondly that asrestoration of Belgian independence.     It is impossible to unravel all the complexities in which the German Government and the German press and politicians delightj but clearly, notwithstanding the protests of a small section of compaia-tively enlightened people, such as DelbrtLok, there is no genuine intention to restore the independence of Belgium;   the authoritative circles, military and political, will not resign themselves to it until they are compelled to do so by foree majeure or by an increase in the popular demand for peace. All that they will do is to offer a sham restoration which will Jieave Belgium practically under German control, especial-ly economic control.5,   Another element is obviously that they hope to use Belgium as a lure to spread about the belief that negotiations are already beginning with England, and so to cause distrust of England among the French to whom the Belgian question isCatholics, they are bound to support
secoadary to that of Alsace Lorraine, and among the Russians who will he lead to &quot;believe that England is aiming at a peace based on the satisfaction about Belgium and to win it at the expense of Russia.     It is of great importance that positive statements that negotiations are in progress are made by the German press, and these are being used in Russia.     if/hile the ground is thus being prepared for mutual distrust among the Allies, the Emperor is going to Sophia, probably to try and arrange an Eastern peace which might have the result of de-taching Russia.6.   The presence of Herr von Kuhlmann at the Gor tan Imperial Foreign Office is making itself felt in the working of the whole semi-official apparatus.     An Imperial foreign Secretary^ influence depends upon his own personal standing and oapacity.     He may, and often has been little more than a mere cipher, as in the case of Herbert Bismarck under his father and of Herr von Richthofen under Prince BCLow.     Or he may be the real manager of foreign policy like Billow under Prince Hohenlohe.     The Chancellor is officially the Foreign Minister of the Empire, and the Foreign Secretary is official-ly his subordinate - technically described as his &quot;represen-tative&quot;.But von Ktihlmann knows a good deal about foreign affairs and has the German diplomatic mind, while.Dr.Michaelie is not believed to know much about them.     The press, under Ktthlmannfs direction, is responding to pressure and persuasion, and, apart from the Pan-Germans and the extreme &quot;annexation-ists&quot;, is presenting a more united front.    The German foreign Office, however, is accustomed to reckon with extreme viewB and to use them as a foil to its own &quot;moderation&quot;.     Every now and then, and always, of course, after a change of personnel in the highest offices, there is an elaborate stock-taking of
the military, the foreign -and the domestic situation.     The word Neuorientierung (new direction of policy) is not a creation of the recent political crisis.     It has been used again and again during the present reign for the initiation of fresh methods of persuasion or deceit.    The superiority of Germanyfs enemies on the T/estern front, the probable extent and effect of American intervention, the collapse of Russia, the discontent in Turkey and Bulgaria, the exhaustion of Austria-Hungary and the tendency of the Emperor Charles to assert his independent views, are all being pondered by the new man at the Foreign Office.    He feels and has publicly confessed that the rupture of German relations f&amp;Nifr ohepower afteranother cannot be a matter of no moment for Germany1s future;   although including America, these new enemies are States whieh Germany has been aooustomed to despise and therefore to underrate in peace time.7.   The new diplomatic direction of the Press does nothave things all its own way.     Germany is technically andactually under a state of siege;   twenty-five or thirty Generalscommanding in the different districts of the country have theright to quell the expression of undesirable public opinionsand are doing so in the case both of newspapers and of attemptedmeetings of the independent Socialist Minority.    A strikingexample is the suppression or suspension of the Gennania, theleading organ of the Catholic Centre.     last week Herr Erzbergerdelivered a speech at Biberach in Wtlrttemberg in which he said:&quot;From the military point of view we can conclude the most brilliant peace imaginable.   But if the eoonomic war continues/ with the boycott of German manufactures and shipping and the stoppage of the supply of raw materials, the most brilliant military victory avails us nothing, since an economic war spells the end of Germany1s prosperity.&quot;Herr Erzberger is further reported to have said:wWe must also insist upon the inviolability of our terri-tory (Alsace-Lorraine?) and of our groat colonial empire,... England must renounce the German colonies in Africa, her Arabian conquests and Mesopotamia..But the Reichstag also
rejects any scheme of conquest for Germany.    We have seen too clearly that a policy like that of the Prussians towards the Poles would contain the germ of future wars.    Does anyone believe that the suppression of little Belgium would guarantee a lasting peace?&quot;5!he Grormania copied the text of this speech from alooal Wtlrttemherg paper.     For this it was suppressed, or rathersuspended, presumably for one day only.     The reasons for thisact are rather difficult to discover as most of what he saidis contained in the semi-official matter supplied to otherpapers;   possibly it was due to the embarrassing reference toPoland, possibly they simply wanted to prevent any public dis-oussion of these matters except that which had been officiallysupplied.    But the suppression of a paper like the Goraaniais a very serious step and will undoubtedly provike violentreorimiuations in the Reichstag, for it 1b in direct defianceof the Resolution which was passed at the end of last month bythe Main Committee to the effect that &quot;the discussion of peaceand war aims should not come under the action of the censorshipand that the suspension of journals and periodicals should onlytake place if some military undertaking was thereby imperilledand then only with the approval of the Chancellor and after thepublishers had been acquainted with, the reasons for the proposedsuspension&quot;.    Dr. Miebaelis will be given another chance ofolearing himself from the suspicion of being the partisan of theJunkers and Pan-Germans, the nominee of Hindenburg and Luden-dorff,     In domestic affairs the reforming Majority in theReichstag will, in any case, increase its influence.8.    It would be unwise to attach any importance to a tele-gram sent by the &quot;Wireless Press&quot; from Berne which purports to give an official Statement as to the verbal communication made by  tlhlmann to the Papal Nuncio.    It comes from an untrustworthy source and there is at present no confirmation of it.J.W.H. G,S.
