(This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Co----- _____... /WAR CAB DOT.jen^o,16/3777 ;27th September, 1917Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Land) Bill. Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War.It should he explained that the present practice, in *ases where Government Departments require land or &quot;buildings for purposes connected with the War, is to take possession under the Defence of the Realm Regulations.   No legal right to compensation is admitted! hut owners and occupiers are entitled to apply to the Defence of the Realm Losses Commission for an ex gratia payment out of public funds in respect of any direct and substantial loss suffered by them.Any agreements for the occupation of land or buildings for war purposes are made on the same basis of direct loss.The view of the legal position on which the above practice is based has been confirmed by the High Court and Court of Appeal, but doubts were cast upon it by the remarks of certain Law Lords in the course of the Argument before the House of Lords in theShoreham Aerodrome case,- -        ijThe principal object of the Bill is to remove those doubts. The Bill is urgently needed because:-(a) Since the Shoreham Aerodrome case was heard in the House of Lords the doubts cast on the Department^ power by the Dicta of the Law Lords who heard the case have become widely known) in the legal profession and at the present moment there are, at least, two petitions of right pending in which compensation is claimed under the Lands Clauses Acts for&apos; property commandeered under the Defence of the Realm Regulations.If it is once decided that compensation on the latter basis is legally payable it will be far more difficult to obtain statutory sanction for compensation on the loss basis than it would be now while the decisions of the lower courts -that there is no legal right to any compensation at all -still stand.(b) There is no doubt that the absence of any legal right to compensation is felt to, be a great grievance.   It is understood that there is a prospect of a Bill being intro-duced in the House of Lords providing that compensation in respect of land and buildings commandeered for war purposes i shall be paid on a Lands Clauses basis.   For reasons if similar to those given above it seems desirable to Forestall any such Bill,
(c) &quot;The re-asens given above assume that it is desirable that the prinoiple of compensating on thelmsis of loss , should be maintained during the war.   In support, of this assumption it need only be pointed out that any *X&amp;p&amp;*^ro&amp;* from that principle would give rise to claim for the revision of practically every award or agreement made on the basis since the commencement, of the war.   The number of such award and agreements is,probably,at least 50,000 and the task of revising them would be almost an impossible one.   Moreover it is submitted that the principle of putting persons whose property or business is interfered., with by the Crown for War purposes im in the same financial position as if there had been no such interference, which is what is meant by compensation on the basis of lbas, is essentially fair..It should be added that at first the War Office were anxious that legislation-should be. obtained with a view to placing on a statutory basis the determination of all questions relating to Compensation&quot; for interference with property in aonnection with the Defence of the Realm.A Bill was drawn with this object but after -consultation with the Departments concerned the Lord Chancellor decided that it would be better to   limit legislation to the adoption of measures of relief from really pressing administrative difficulties.   This is the genesis of the Bill now submitted,The,Lord Chancellor and the Law Officers.are aware of the considerations which have led to the drafting of the present Billand the former expressly desired that the Bill should be submitted in principle to the War Cabinet for their. decision before he considered the terms of the Bill in derail ^including;. the alternative to Clause 2 suggested in. para 7 Counsel;s Explanatory Memorandum,.28th September, 1917,DERBY,
