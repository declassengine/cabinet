7?gIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS &quot;BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT). 2X79 WAR   CABINET.ACCELERATION OF MERCHANT SHIPBUILDING IN, THB UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.Draft of a proposed telegram to President Wilson, prepared by the Ministry of Shipping.(Circulated with reference to War Cabinet 241, Minute 12).I venture to invito your earnest attention to following facts in shipping position.   The total world tonnage lost by enemy action first 30 months of the war was about 4- - million tons gross.   A further 4  million tons was lost in the first 7 months of intensive submarine campaign.   At rate of loss during this campaign and allow-ing for marine risk losses and for serious damage to vessels not actually sunk the total loss of world tonnage may be taken at about 8 million tons gross per annum, this rate being rather more favourable, than previous estimate of 8-j- million tons as result of recent improve-ment whioh at tho moment is being maintained.   Against this Great Britain whose building last year was brought down to some 600,000 frone gross through expenditure of strength in other directions is making immense efforts to build 2  million tons next year but it is feared that it will be impossible to realise this programme fully. Allowing for building /&quot;inrest of world outside America and at present rate of loss this means deficit of at least 5  million tons gross per annum.   Meantime as you know tonnage even apart from future losses is very seriously short of what is needed to meet Allied military and civilian requirements.   In spring tonnage must be limiting factor to operations in every sphere.   It is important to make it clear now that Great Britain sees no prospeot of being able both to continue her ewn naval and military share in war and to transport in her own ships supplies for forees and for oivilian population and also to continue to give as many ships to her Allies as heretofore.   At the same time needs of France and Italy for food and coal already great will in spring be extremely serious.   Similarly Russia may want supplies for 1918 White Sea season for whioh British ships will not be available, $hie will be the time too when America will be faced with the great problem of transporting her own armies and supplies.   In these circumstances earnestly suggest you should consider whether it is not possible for America to commence building programme sufficient with building in rest of the world to outbuild submarine destruction at present rate, i.e.   -programme of say side million tons gross a year. This means of course immense effort but you will remember that reason why it is impossible for us to build on this scale is that in. common with our Allies we had to expend out strength upon the immediate necessity in the early stages of the war of increasing armies navies and fiiunitionm, and strength ie now committed in these directions.   A much smaller effort directed to shipbuilding would have enabled us to outbuild submarine destruction even at present rate.   It was only \n third year of war however that merchant shipping beoame factor as vital as armies navies and munitions.
It is at this stage that America whose industrial and engineering reeources are greatest of any country entered the war and effort required to outbuild submarine destruction immense as it is relatively email compared with task successfully achieved by Allies in other directions.     To build six million tons gross would take about 3s- millions tons of steel or less than 10% of American output and perhaps half a million men majority Unskilled.     If programme of kind suggested were once actually taken in hand and pressed vigorously it might we suggest have an effect upon German hopes and consequently on German endurance altogether out of proportion to any similar effort in any other direction and might have decisive effect even before any large number of the vessels had been actually built.     No building programme of the kind indicated, above could of course mature soon enough to provide number of ships which will be demanded       *       next spring but the knowledge that ships will be available at later dates will make it possible to work on narrower margins and would materially assist to get through extremely critical period before the harvests of next summer.It is true that, during the last week or two, the amount of tonnage destroyed by submarines has materially diminished, but we oannot yet be sure that this improvement is more than temporary.     It would clearly be very rash to base any permanent policy or calculations on it, and I cannot therefore too strongly emphasise the most serious danger that the relatively much greater expoditure of effort in other directions by all countries at war with Germany may be nullified and rendered ineffective if effort in this direction of building ships is inadequate.America is training a great army.     It is of the greatest importance that it should be transported and maintained without the withdrawal of so many ships engaged in maintaining present forces as will subtract as much strength from them as the American Army will add.
