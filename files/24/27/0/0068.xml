Affiis DOCOMgHT IS THE PBOfERTX OP H^S BBITANKIC MAJESTIC&apos;S; OOVBRKMENT)1.WAHCABINETeSUGGESTED CESSION OF VIRGIN jSLAKDS TO Tfife UNITEDsmB&apos;qrmaiflA Aim roni? wear bs same.The following paper, which has been prepared at the Admiralty, has been dent to toe by the Fii*st Lord for the information of tne War Cabinet,i2 Whitehall Gar dene^ S,W,, (intd.) M.P.A.H,$Oth September 1917.In an Article entitled &quot;Our Gibraltar&quot;, published in the July ftumber of &quot;The Worldrs Work&quot;, *lr George Marvin discusses the neoeseity of establishing an American &amp;aval Base ff the first magnitude in Caribbean Waters for the^protection $ American interests in the tfeet Indies and the Canal Zone,   rXe discusses -the relative values of various sites in Cuba, Haiti, San Domingo* Puerto Rioo, and the Virgin Islands recently acquired from Denmark, and decides in favour of forcing a Base M building breakwaters enclosing the area between the newly acquired Virgin Islands of St. Tnemas and St, John.   t He points out that the only objections ifrtiioh can be made to the selection of this site for the Haval Base are (1) difficulties as regards water supply, which, however, dan be surmounted, and (2) the close proximity of the British Islands of Jost Van Dtfke, TortolaJ and Virgin Gorda, which Islands dominate the approach from the Atlantic te Sti Thomas and St, John.    Mr Marvin.suggests tn4t Great Britain mi&amp;ht possibly be willing to hand oVer these Islands to U.S,A* or, if not, might a^roe by Treaty to leave tham, as at present, unfortified, and he points out that the latter course might best serve the purposes of the United States, as in the event of War between America and a Third Power the existence of neutral British Waters in this region would be a distinct gain to America,If Mr Marvin1s Article is to be considered as officially inspired, it would seem that U.S,A, are considering the advisability of approaching Great Britain on the matter.    It would become necessary, therefore, to consider what quid pro quo should be asked for if such a suggestion should come from the United States and the British Government decide to negotiate.    It should be borne in mind, however, that the United States have already obtained very considerable Interests in the Greater and Less Antilles extending from the coast of Florida eastward to the Virgin Islands, and at various times suggestions have been made unofficially for the acquisition of French, Dutch and Venezuelan possessions in the Lesser Antilles, the transfer of which to the United States would give them a preponderating influence in the Caribbean Sea.
Sir Alexander Swetfeenham makes the suggestion that some territorial concession should &quot;be sought in proximity to the Straits of Juan de Puca, Karo, and Georgia, in order to improve the access to the Canadian Ports of Esquimalt, Victoria, and Vancouver.   The boundary between British Columbia and the United States at this point was fixed by arbitration of the German Emperor in 1872 which put an end to a period of f.strained relation which had fcr somoyears existed between Great Britain and the United States in connection with this boundary,&quot;Admiral Parry, Rydrographer, points out that it would be extremely unlikely thaythe United Stateo would entertain the giving up of any territcry in this region, nor does he think any useful object would be attained by a transfer to Great Britain of any Islands in the Straits in question, as the proximity ofother Islands would obviously militate against the- possibility of any superiority in gun protection being affected.    Admiral Parry states that the only two. portions of the Glebe where the U,c. ,A. have possessions contiguous to British possessions which appear worthy of consideration in this connection are:-(l) The Eastern portion of the Samoan Group in the Pacific the Western portion of this Group being formerly German possessions and now in British occupation, and(2) The Islands, including the Sulu Archipelago,  extending from Mindanao (which is the     &quot;sbu^tharniiost-    of the larger Islands in the Philippine Group) in a South Vesterly direction towards British North Borneo;Captain Nugent, for D.I.D., emphasises the undesirability of permitting the.Caribbean Sea to come under U.S.A. control and possibly become a &quot;tare clauanm&quot; to European Nations, and points out, in reference to the American Pacific possessions, that all these had a definite place in the American strategic scheme against Japan&apos;s ante-bellum position in the Pacific and that the possibility of Japan retaining some of the Islands she has captured, tends to weaken the American position,   Hebqncludes that U.S.A. would not, therefore, be likely to abandon any Pacific island possession that has a potential value against the Japanese menace.   Both American Samoa and the Sulu Archipelago are in this category.Captain Nugent agrees with Admiral Parry?s objections to the territorial exchange in the Straits of Puca suggested by Sir Alexander Swett^enham. &quot;Admiral Hope, D.O.D., concurs with Captain Nugent and points out that it does not appear likely that the United States would suggest, or agree to, any exchange of territory, but that any engagement on our part not to fortify the ^ritish Virgin Islands should receive a quid pro quc.
