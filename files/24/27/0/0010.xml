USECRET.Department of Information, Intelligence Bureau. FFW/OH90Weekly Report on Jrance. XI September 2(fcot, 1917.So much has happened in France since the Report of August 30th that to attempt to deal with it all would be to swell this Report to an intolerable length.     Fortunarely however much or most of it has been so fully reported in the English press that there i3 no need to go Aver the ground again here.     The actual events at any rate need not be referred to in i-ny detail:   the interesting question is net what has happened which we all know but rather the meaningfaf what has happened which is by no means so easy to ascertain.     Any attempt to read it must as yet be very provisional:   only the next few weeks can give the full answer.It was anticipated in the Reports of August 16th and 30th that though M. Malvy had so far refused to resign, the facto would soon   compel him to do so;   that M. Ribot would reorganise hie Cabinet, leaving him and others out, among them M. Viviani, bringing in II. Klotz, the President of the Budget Committee, if possible, and certainly retaining the services of M. Thomas.     This is in fact what he seems to have tried to do; but the Socialists definitely refused to support him, M. Thomas accepted the decision of his party, and an attempt to form a Cabinet without any Socialist members was defeated at the last moment by M. Painleve\ who decided that he could not join a Cabinet containing no representative of the Socialist Party.     M. Painleve was himself then called upon to form a Ministry.     He at once proceeded to consult the Socialists, who made a formidable drclaration of the conditions of their support.     They seem to have also expressed strong objections to the proposed presence of M. Ribot at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Ultimately they reiused to join altogether and, inconsistent as his
nduct may seem, 11. Painleve^ proceeded to form a Cabinet without them, a task which he successfully accomplished. He has now met the Chamber and received his first Vote of   Confidence.Such in barest outline is the history of the crisis.     ^hat is its (significance?   And first of all what is the   meaning of the antion of the Socialist party on which so much has turned?   It was noted in the Report of August 16th as a thing of bad omen that in the Division in the Chamber on August 2nd on H. Renaudej^s interpellation the Cover^ ment majerity though very large included f0.r the first time no Socialis? This oaiwi has been fulfilled.     Whatever their reason may be, the Socialists have now taken the step which at that time they refused to take and withdrawn thoir representative from the Cabinet.     M. Thomas himself has had an active share in their decision, though it is only a few weeks ago $hat he expressed himself strongly on the advantage of his remaining a Minister.     And with an inconsistence which more than parallels that of      Paimleve, he particularly objected to serving with hi. Ribot at the Foreign Office, though he had so cheerfully served under him as Prime Minister.     What is the meaning of it all?Human motives are usually mixed, and the key is probably to be fcund partly in personal ambitions (M. Thomas i-9 thought to have desired a more important position than that of Minister of   Munitions) but mush more in the internal conditions of the Socialist party.    The division apparently healed by the surrender of the Majority to the views of the Minority on the subject of Stockholm, is in fact sharper than ever, and each wing is manoeuvring for position at the Conference of the Party which .is about to be held at Bordeaux.     It was probably felt by the more moderate men such as M. Thomas and even M. Renaudel that tbrey v/ould be in a stronger position there if they had repudiated all association with M. Ribot who had dared to defy the party, and even,, to make it a little ridiculous, by refusing to grant the passparts
- % -necessary to enable it to carry out its much advertised intention of going to Stockholm.     In fact, as has recently been seen in England, a Labour Member or Socialist who has resigned or refused to join a Ministry has a much better chance of making a brave show at a popular Conference, than one who has on his shoulders a share of   the responsi-bility for all the unpopular things a Government is obliged to do.There is no reason then to exaggerate the gravity of the Socialist decision to stay outside, serious as it undoubtedly is.    The party will now very pooeibly form with other members of the Extreme Left a more or less regular Opposition in the Chamber, which, so far as it is in the hands of men like Thomas, will certainly   be patriotic and will have its advantage^ as well asjits disadvantages-     One of the disadvantages will be an inevitable closer alliance with M. Caillaux and his faction, who tried to deprive M. Painleve1 of the support of the Radical Socialist party, without v/hich he could not have proceeded.   They, however, met with a rebuff, only producing one secession from the proposed Cabinet, though the Pays alleges they have the bulk of the party with them. This may or may not be.     Party ties, are far looser in France than in England, except among the regular S6cialists.     And eyen there the split is now undisguised.     Over this matter of joining the Ministry there was acute difference of opinion:   and M. 3Tarenn*, a Moderate Socialist, who was afeked to join the Ministry, has not concelaed the sharpness of his disapproval, of the action taken, though, from considerations of party discipline, ho bowed to it.     He has gone so far as to say openly in his paper that it was taken with a view to winning the battle of Bordeaux, but with too much forgetfulneos of a greater battle that is being fought all oteer Europe.     &quot;hat will be tho outcome?Of course it is too early to say with any confidence.     Have the Socialists overreached themselves?    They appear to have been condemned by sections of public opinion not usually unfriendly to them.     The Prolongation of the Cabinet crisis was not without its dangers, and
-4-blame for it is rightly laid on the shoulders of the Socialists.   The successive rebuffs they have received in H. Ribot&apos;s action ubout Stockholm and H. ?alnleve&apos;s resolution to go on without them may force them to take a more moderate view of their own importance.   On the other hand, they have given themselves a great advertisement, never a disadvantage in modern politics, and the violent abuse of the re-acti^nary press will strengthen their position among the workmen, Those indirect power in politics is greater than their visible re-presentation in the Chamber.       The great danger before the Socialist party is that of a formal and definite division into two halves,    it seems almost certain to come sooner or later, but how soon no one can say.   The Inter-Allled Conference in London showed how impossible it is to secure agreement between practical men like M. Thomas or the English Labour leaders and extremists who have swallowed half the follies of the Russian Soviet,-    The division is very marked in the French party.   The selection of delegates for that Conference pro-duced sharp controversy and resulted in a complete victory for the Moderate party.   The organs of the extreme wing angrily complained of the defeat of Cachin, Moutet and other members of the Russian section. And the principal or only result of the Conference was a declaration of war aims, excluding the narrower interpretation of the Russian for-mula of &quot;No indemnities and no annexations&quot;, a declaration which was signed by the four Moderate delegates, but not signed by Longuet; the one representative of the Left wing.   These differences are sure to come up again at Bordeaux, and may lead to such a split as will break up the single party as it has been broken up in Germany.Meanwhile M. Painleve and his Cabinet have met the Chamber, made their declaration of policy and received a vote of confidence against which only one vote was recorded.   But there were 130 abstentions, ln-cluding all but two of the Socialists.     On the whole it seems that neither the composition of the new Cabinet nor the Ministerial
eitherdeclaration have been received with any great enthusiasm, ^-irth in the Cumber or in the Press.     It was   hoped that a new and comparatively young: Prime Minister *;;ould go outside the &quot;old; gang&quot; and form a Cabinet of capacities rather than one bisect on the old system of ccn-ciliating   various Parliamentary groups.     But IL Painleve&apos; rs Cabinet is much like all the rest.     The only startlingly new thing about it is the Institution of a War Committee described as on the English model.     But this is not the case,   , The Journal Officiel in its account of the functions of this Committee makes it clear that it is in no way parallel to the English &apos;&apos;ii\r Cabinet which decides all important questions on its own authroity.     On the contrary, the French Committee though &quot;charged with the political direction of the war &quot; will only meet &quot;at leost once 9 week&quot; and will submit its decisions for the approval of the whole Cabinet.     Jind there is still less novelty in the eompo-sition of the Cabinet.     One observer describes it, not very unfairly, ^ft *s a more or lesr Conservative Cabinet with a more or less Radical Chief.     The important Ifinietry of the Interior is filled however by a Radical anti-clerical of much the same type as the fallen Malvy, M. Steeg.     That office is regarded by the Radicals and Radical Socialists as their specie 1 property, and M. Oainlevo&apos; h:\s not disobeyed the in-junction ho received from them- 3arly in the crisis that it must be re-served for them, though he successfully defied a demand of M. Caillaux and his group that it should be given to their nominee.     Altogether if H. Painleve&apos;rs Ministry is to have a long life it will have to get stronger as it grows up.     The first appearances are somewhat colour-less.     The Ministerial declaration contained the usual string of sonorous aspirations and gratified the Socialists by mentioning the Society of Nations.     But .,he public in France and abroad will follow the parties in the Chamber and the Press in giving all this only a Provisional support, and awaiting the actions of the Cabinet before
building any high hopes on it.    It seems likely to have a lair trial. The Socialists deny any intention of pursuing a wrecking policy and express the hope that they will he able   to give their support. M. Thomas, though evidently suffering from, some sense of grievance against H. Ribot and M. Painleve and urging his party to abstain from voting in the division, announces that the union of the nation is stronger than ever as the result of the crisis and promises that he himself means to v-ork hard at a campaign for its maintenance. There is no sign in any nev.- quarter of weakening on the essential question.   The most applauded passage of the Prime Minister&apos;s speech was that in which he declared that &quot;to stop the war a day too sonn \-ould be to deliver France irto the most degrading servitude&quot;. So reports from the provinces sent by people who have been moving among the workmen indicate that the Labour organisations are generally favourable to the continuance of the war.     On the whole the country is sound.But it cannot be denied that it is restless and somewhat disturbed.   This Report is already too long to allow of my entering here into the succession of scandals -,hich have during the last month not only caused the Ministerial crisis, but exasperated and alarmed the country.   Ye have seen the Duval affair, the Almereyda affair, the Bolo Pasha afft r, and now the most serious of all,  the Turmel affair,, in which a JDeputy is charged \ 1th conveying intelligence to the enemy.   The Chamber seems certain agree to the demand &apos;of the Public Prosecutor for the necessary suspension of Parliamentary immunity.    It is not possible to say more at this stage. But it is obvious that so many accusations of relations with the enemy, involving journalists and politicians, must increase the already serious unpopularity of Parliament and the political world. France, as has been shown again and agoin, notrb ly in the Dreyfus case, is easily worked into a frenzy of suspicion.   Anything of the kind at this moment would be entirely fatal to the national union.
For there is this painful fact about the accusations: they all involve persons connected vith the parties of the Extreme Left, and especially the world of      Caillaux.     Duval and Almereyda were directors of the Bonnet Rouge, a paper al\.ays in the closest relations with K, Caillauxj Bolo is said to have been a friend of his;   Turmel is at least of the same political colour.   The attacks on them have naturally been led by the nevrspapers of the opposite oamp -   And they have naturally tended to suggest to the Conservative world that all the Caillaux Radical party is tainted with the infamy of treason.   But there lies the danger.   Anyone vho has ever taken part in an election knows that nothing makes a candidate so popular as an unjust attack on his character.   Even a just attack often has the same effect, especially if it comes from an unpopular quarter. The people \,ho led the attack on I/i. Malvy and who are the enemies of M. Caillaux are not popular in vforking-class circles.   There Is a danger that b$ pushing their advantage too far they will turn it to a. disaster to themselves and even to the country.       Already there is evidence that Labour and Socialist organisations are uniting to resist an apprehended Reactionary Coup d&apos;Etat.     The danger of anything of the kind is absolutely non-existent, so far as foreign observers can judge.     But.the belief in it is a danger of another kind and much more serious.   It is to be hoped that the justly incensed Conservatives will leave the unravelling of these crimes, if crimes there were, as seems almdst certain, to the unprompted operations of the courts.   The condition of this is, of course, that there must be no more of these mysterious delays which both in the Duval and the Turmel case (already known to the Cabinet early in July) suggest occult influences resisting the course of justice. M. Painleve in his ministerial statement promises that justice shall follow her course without hesitation or weakness or regard for any personal considerations.     If this is so things will yet be well and
it will be possible to say when all is over, as he says now, that 1whatever may be the issue of this sad affair, it cannot affect any party&apos;.     But only on that condition, and on the condition of journalists and politicians refraining as far as possible from making party capital out of these charges. Democratic passion is very blind:   and to tell the French population before you can prove it that M. Caillaux is a traitor, which he may possibly be, may merely result in his being taken for a patriot and a hero which he most assuredly Is not.    It is to be hoped that all the patriotic groups and more especially those politically most opposed to K. Caillaux will not force the pace at all, but will quietly enjoy the advantage they and the country derive from the discredit inevitably cast upon him by the recent disclosures.   ?i&quot;hether in hatred of H. Barthou, who gave damning evidence in the trial of Madame Caillaux in 1914, or In an endeavour to get rid of this Cabinet in favour of one which would hush up these accusations against his friends, he certainly tried to induce the Radical Socialist party to wreck M. Painleve by refusing to join.   He failed in his attempt;    only thirty members of the party out of 160 attended his meeting:   and 13 members of it have accepted office.   Again, he had always been regarded as a likely successor to H. Klotz in the Presidency of the Budget Committee.    Indeed, that fear was, as has been said in a previous Report, a reason which militated against the inclusion of H. Klotz in the Ministry.   Well, M. Klotz is Minister of Finance and M. Caillaux put forward his candidature to fill the vacant place, but has had to withdpav it and M. Lebrun has been elected.   These are all signs that go with greater things to prove that the main currents of opinion in France are still perfectly sound and by no means ready to allow either milita?ry disappointments due to the Russian collapse, or political malaise due to them and to the
p.S.     As mention was made in the Report for August 30th of the report that K. Caillaux was in Switzerland, It is fair to say that he denies having been there   for years.    In any case he has come back and was very active in the Lobbies during the crisis, with the success which has just been mentioned.discovery of treasons, to drive her into the arms of anyone who is in a hurry to betray her just hopes and make terms with her enemies.20.9.17, JCBt
