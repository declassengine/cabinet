(1)26th September, 1917.Sir,I beg to submit the following Report on the work of the Pood Production Department for the week ended the 25th September:-LOCAL ORGANISATION. Agricultural Executive Committees. The following matters are selected from the weekly reports of Agricultural Executive Committeesj-The Leicestershire Committee have been authorised to take possession of about 200 acres of land at Ragdale, adjoining land of which they are already in possession;   both pieces of land will be cultivated together.     The land of which possession has now been taken is in the occupation of a woman over 70 years of age, who only employs the labour of a grandson and one soldier, and the land is much neglected.The Suffolk (West) Committee report that they have induced the owner of a farm at Drinkstone to fell about 1,000 trees on the farm so as to allow of increased cultivation.The Sussex (East) Committee have abandoned the intention of serving a cultivation order on the East Blatchington Golf Course, on account of the heavy claim to compensation that would be involved. Compensation for Breaking up Grass Land.   The Defence of the Realm (Losses) Commission had before them on September 25th the first claim for compensation for the breaking up of grass land.     The claim arose In consequence of an order issued by the Berkshire Agricultural Executive Committee to break up land and grow vegetables thereon in 1917,    The land was held under a yearly tenancy and the&quot;    To avoid delays address all communications to:  The Director General,2146 :;
X 0 Jcontract contained a covenant that the tenant should retain in the same condition throughout the tenancy all the land in grass, and that he should pay  50 as liquidated damages for every acre of land broken up without the written consent of the landlord. This land had been laid down with grass about sixteen years ago, before the commencement of the present tenancy.   It was urged that the land was of greater value as grass land than as arable because it would command a higher rent and the farm would let more readily.   The measure of compensation claimed was the amount of loss that would be incurred in putting the land down to grass again, after the cultiva-tion directed by the Committee had come to an end.   The Commission pointed out that there was at present no loss of income from the land as the tenant continued to pay the same rent; but that the claim was in fact for possible loss of capital value.   They were of opinion that the amount of this loss, If any^ could not be assessed at the present moment, and that it would not be ascertainable until the end of the present occupation, or possibly a later date.   The Commission stated that their practice in cases of apprehended damage was to reserve any claim to the end of the present occupation with liberty to apply.   Accordingly they&apos; adjourned the present application sine die, reserving to the claimant all his rights, with liberty to apply for a determination of his claim at the proper time.It was suggested to the Commission on behalf of the Board that the numerous applications of a similar nature which would probably be received should be dealt with in a similar way, and that in order to save time and expense the applicants might, after their applications had been filed, be informed of the Commission1s practice on the matter and told that the hearing of their applications would be held over until such time as they should be in a position to give evidence of the amount of loss sustained, and should apply to have their claims determined.   The Commission agreed to this suggestion, with the proviso that each applicant should be given an opportunity of accepting it, or, if he preferred it, of going before the Commission to be heard. The Commission stated that they had a con-siderable number of claims for compensation (in respect of
&quot;Interference by other^Departmerrts) which were in a similar position to the present claim;   and one of the Commissioners -expressed the opinion that when the Commission should come to an end there would be a necessity for legislation, in order to provide for the disposal of claims, whose determination had been postponed owing to the impossibility of ascertaining the extent of the loss, until some future date.Drainage of Lands.   In addition to other schemes in hand in that county, the Norfolk Committee are taking up the improvement of the River Tud with the consent of the owners of adjoining lands.   The Cambridgeshire Committee are enquiring into the condition of the River Rhee.   The Suffolk Committee are calling a conference of owners with a view to the improvement of the River Lark. Damage by Game. Action under the Rabbits Order is reported from Derbyshire and East Sussex, and under the Pheasants Order, from Essex.Determination Of Tenancies. During the week six Orders have been made authorising landlords to determine tenancies on account of bad farming in respect of 1,003 acres, and four Orders have been made by the Board determining the tenancies of 226 acres.Allotments. Reports from 1,084 districts have been received, showing that in those districts 196,968 persons made application, of whom 177,702 have been supplied with plots under the Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917 (No.2).   The total area of the land so provided is 13,140 acres,HORTICULTURAL DIVISION.The number of Horticultural Representatives is now 701. During the past week each Representative has received leaflets on &quot;Seeds for Cropping Small Allotments&quot; and on the &quot;Care and Use of Knapsack Spraying Machines&quot;. Since the beginning of March last a million pamphlets have been distributed by the Horticultural Division.The demand for demonstrations in fruit bottling continuesto be large. 166 demonstrations were given during the past week, andapplications have been received for Demonstration Classes to becontinued during the winter months.2,400 tons out of the total of 2,500 tons of preserving sugar for jam making have now been distributed.-3-
The total number of glass jars sold is now 1,620,574;   these have been distributed through 729 organisations.During the week 12 Home Canners have been sold, making a total of 128.     21 public demonstrations in the use of the canner have also been given.Potato Spraying.   From enquiries which are being made in the various counties, it is apparent that the local authorities generally are alive to the importance of encouraging the more general practice of spraying, and offers of active assistance in the work for next year have been received from Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Cornwall, Devon-shire, Dorset, Hampshire and Somerset.Fruit and Vegetable Pulping and Drying.     The first consignment of Tomlinson Haas Drying Machines for use by the Department has been inspected, passed and is now being erected at Messrs. Meux&apos;s Brewery, London.     The second machine is ready for despatch and will be sent to Pershore.     Two machines have already been delivered to private firms.TECHNICAL DIVISION. Wintering of Hill Sheep.     A detailed report has been prepared on the improvement of hill land and the wintering of sheep at high elevations, containing the result of an enquiry set on foot last July. Plant Diseases.     Twenty-one reports with respect to different localities have been received from honorary correspondents.     The reports cover a wide field and refer to almost all crops.     Visits have been made to Berkshire and Cheshire in connection with the outbreak of Wheat Bulb Fly and of Antler Moth which occurred during the past summer, and experiments with a view to the control of these pests are in progress.Utilisation of   Straw.     An extensive series of experiments into the manurial and feeding values of straw is in progress, and at the Rothamsted Research Station the question of breaking down the straw by a ferment as a preliminary to its use as manure is receiving the whole-time attention of one of the Technical Advisers.     The prepara-tion of straw for fodder by the soda-digestion process is being investigated at Leeds.
LABOUR.Soldier Labour.     The weekly returns show that 1,187 skilled and 638 unskilled men were sent out from the Distribution Centres . during the week.     8,865 skilled men for the 1918 Programme have so far arrived at Distribution Centres, and of these 6,807 have been sent out to farmers or for training.There is a serious deficiency of skilled ploughmen, but arrangements are being made in most Centres to put into operation forthwith the scheme for training men as ploughmen. The Department has been informed of 9 such training centres already opened.During the week 120 men have been supplied for training as tractor drivers, making 504 men supplied for this purpose to date.      In addition 15 men have been sent out for training with steam ploughing or threshing tackle, 98 such men having been supplied to date.Horses.     In connection with the supply of horses for the 1918 Programme, it has been decided that in cases in which the circumstances warrant an exception being made from the usual rule, horses may be sent out not in charge of ploughmen working under the control of Executive Committees.     Orders for the issue of 276 additional horses have been sent to Remount Depots, making a total of 1,753 horses to date.Sale of Horses Order.     With a view to obtaining a stricter compliance with Regulation 2T, a Circular letter explaining the intention and importance of the Sale of Horses Order has been Issued by the Home Office to all Chief Constables, calling their attention to the desirability of the police being on the alert to detect attempts at evasion of the Order, particularly at horse sales and fairs, and asking that the police may be instructed accordingly, proceedings being taken when necessary.
Prisoners of War.   The War Office have been asked to make arrangements for winter quarters to be supplied in the case of two of the existing prisoner camps where the men are at present under canvas.   Requests have been sent to the War Office during, the week that 190 men may be added to certain of the existing agricultural camps.Women1s Branch.The number of National Service women now actually employed on farm work is 4,777*   A further 1,312 are undergoing training, and 96 waiting to be placed in Training Centres.   The number waiting for employment either in their own homes or in depots is 259.There are signs of an increasing demand for skilled women labour, especially milkers and women who can plough. This demand is likely to continue during the winter.   The arrangements for holding an advanced course at the South Eastern Agricultural College, Wye, are practically completed.   Forty-five women have so far applied for the 15 scholarships offered by the Department.MECHANICAL CULTIVATION.In view of the impending large deliveries of tractorsand other implements, a great increase of work will fall upon theMachinery and Implement Section in the near future, and it hasbeen found necessary to strengthen the existing Departmentalorganisation both at headquarters and in the country.   Thefollowing scheme accordingly came into force yesterday:-1.     The &quot;Machinery and Implements Section&quot; has been expanded and renamed the &quot;Mechanical Cultivation Division&quot;. It has been placed under my immediate control.2.     The work of the Division has been separated into two main Sections, each of which will be administered by a Director.3.     Lieutenant Colonel E.W. Allen, who has been responsible for framing the Tractor Scheme, will now superintend its practical operation, and has been appointed the new Director of the organisation in the country&quot;.
i5)u4.     Lieutenant Colonel H.M. Stobart (Lord Durham&apos;s principal agent) has been appointed the new Director of the organisation at Headquarters.Motor Tractors.   The following statement shows the positionwith regard to the supply of motor tractors:-Consigned to Agricultural Executive Committeesup to date of last Report ... 1,268Consigned during this 7/eek ... ... 1121,380Allocated to counties, not yet despatched 79Balance on hand ... ... ...        _4Total.       1,463SUPPLIES.Supplies Sub-Committees. Supplies Sub-Committees have now been formed in 31 counties in England and 12 counties in 7vrales. Approved Agents to the number of 238 have been appointed in 27 counties, and 7,700 tons of sulphate of ammonia have been put into store by these Agents as a reserve to meet the requirements of farmers next Spring.   Action on similar lines is being taken in all but 5 of the remaining counties of England and Steles. Sulphate of Ammonia. Since the Sulphate of Ammonia Committee commenced operations in June last orders for 49,000 tons have been placed by the Committee.Superphosphate.   In the nine weeks from July 7th to September 13th only about 60,000 tons of phosphate rock had been loaded and although every effort is being made by the Ministry of Munitions, and constant pressure exercised on the Ministry of Shipping, it does not seem possible, as things are going at present, to count on the import of more than an average of 25,000 tons per month.   The demand for phosphatic fertilisers may be measured by the fact that the output of basic slag until 31st May next has already been oversold.   Unless, therefore, phosphate rock can be brought into the country at the rate
decided upon by the $ar Cabinet (namely- 50,000 tons per month), the Food Production policy will be gravely hampered. Compound Fertilisers.   The Draft Order which has been prepared by the Ministry of Munitions, fixing the price of Compound Fertilisers on a unit basis has raised a number of complicated questions which have heeded very careful consideration. Conferences have taken place with representatives of persons engaged In the trade and concessions have been made which it is hoped will obviate any undue hardship.   The Order, as finally amended, is to be submitted to the Phosphates and Potash Committee on Friday, and it is hoped that It will be possible to issue it immediately thereafter.Fencing Wire.   The whole output of barbed wire in this country is required for military purposes and none can be allocated for agriculture.   It is believed, however, that there is still a small quantity of imported barbed wire in the hands of certain dealers.As regards plain fencing wire, the sale is limited to wire certified to be required for the protection of growing crops and no individual farmer may purchase more than 15 cwts.   There are at present two manufacturers who are able to execute orders for agricultural purposes, but the quantity in hand is small. Representations are being made with a view to the allocation of steel for the manufacture of additional supplies.    Orders have been placed by Approved Agents with manufacturers for over 9,000 yards of sheep and rabbit netting.Seed Control.   The accommodation selected for the Seed Testing Station at No. 70 Victoria Street has been found admirably suited for the purpose, and arrangements have been made for carrying out the necessary alterations by the Office of ?/orks. The Treasury have sanctioned the expenditure required for equipping the station.
Seed Wheat.   There is an increased demand for seed wheat of the 1917 crop, and, although the total sales at present amount to little more than 300 quarters, enquiries are reaching the Department from farmers in all parts of the United Kingdom. Seeds (other than Cereals).   The issue of the Food Production Leaflet on &quot;Economy in the use of Seeds&apos;1 has been welcomed by representative members of the trade, who are prepared to assist in providing standard packets for the use of allotment holders. Seed Potatoes. The following supplies of immune seed have been secured up to the present by the Purchasing Committee in Lancashire, Cheshire, Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and Cambridge:-VarietyTonsOreat Scot King George VLochar ......Templar .....238 71701601,115I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,Director-General.The Rt.
