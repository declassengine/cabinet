I desire to invite the attention of the War Cabinet as a matter of urgency, to the present position with regard to the Order of the British Empire which is causing me considerable difficulty and inconvenience.   The absence of any list for the Dominions is giving rise to criticisms, and I am daily receiving representations on the subject. But I cannot usefully ask the Governors General to submit lists until I am in a position to tell them how many honours in the several classes will be available for each of them; and this again cannot be determined until some scale of proportion has been established as between this country on the one hand and the Dominions and Colonies on the other.I have consulted my colleagues of the Home Office, Foreign Office and War Office and I find that they are experiencing similar inconvenience.   They authorise me to say that they concur with me in regarding it as essential that the responsibility for dealing with the various points arising in connection with the new Order should be devolved forthwith on one of the public offices where the Chancery of the Order would be located; and we consider that the Home Office is the natural and best office for the purpose.   In the absence of such an arrangement things seem to have come to a deadlock, and we venture to urge on the War Cabinet the importance of taking the course suggested without any further delay. Until this is done, I see no prospect of getting the matter put of its present cha.otic condition, and I fear that grave scandal may ensue.WALTER H. LONGSeptember 1917.
