SECRET.Intelli^ence Bureau,Deo ailment of Information.BB-W/017.Weekly Report on Poland. XVII. (4tii October, 1917.)The Polish Regency Council was formed in the last days of September and consists of Archbishop Kakowski, Prince Z. Lubomirski and Count J. Ostrowski.     The Inter-Party Union, the organisation in which the National Democrats are dominant, has failed to secure the appointment of its candidate for the Regency Council, M. Swiezynski, and Prince Z. Lubomirski himself has resigned his membership of the Inter-Party Union.Judging from its composition, the Regency Council will rely in the first place on the support of the Conservative elements -the Roman Catholic hierarchy and the land-owning aristocracy and gentry.     Its appointment marks the last step in the reconciliation of the original pro-Austrian, and the aristocratic branch or&quot; the late pro-Russian, Conservatives.     When noting the movement in that direction in our report of June 27 we expressed the supposition that the leading spirits in it were Prince Z. Lubomirski and Count Adam Tarnoweki, supported by Archbishop Kakowski.     Events have proved this supposition to have been correct and these three were proposed by the Council of State as candidates for the Regency Council.     But, owing to opposition on the part of Germany, Count Tarnewski, the late Austro-Hungarian minister at Sofia and ambassador at Washington, refused to join the Regency Council -w&amp;ich also was- only to be expected.     -Jin our report of August 10 we stated that Count Tarnowski was not likely to prove acceptable to the Germans for office in Poland &quot;because he is much too clever
and much too closely connected! with Austria&quot;.J     Count Ostrowski was then asked to take his place.Archbishop Kakowski is a politician of doubtlul character. He was originally head of the Roman Catholic Theological Seminary at Petrograd and-, by extreme subserviency to the late Russian  ovoroment, earned its favour and his own preferment-     Of the Polish political parties both before the war end during its earlier part he favoured most the National Democrats.    Since the Russian Revolution and in spite of, or perhaps owing to, the fact that it recognised polish independence, Archbishop Kakowski seems to have come out on the anti-Russian Side - it is safe to do so now that it is certain that the Russians do not any longer intend to return te Poland.    About the middle of April he published a Pastoral Letter which spoke reproachfully of the obedience shown by the Poles in the past to the Russian authorities - and this in spite of the Archbishop*s own political past.    He called on the people to respect &quot;the nascent Polish authorities&quot; and went on with much more to the same effect.     It is only to be expected that now when he himself is one of the chief men in the government Archbishop Kakowski will launch anathemas against any one who does not obey it.Prince 2. lubomirski is certainly not the great statesman, which the Inter-Party Union advertised him to be whilst he was still a member of it.    This however must be said in his favour, that he -w has known how to behave with dignity both towards the Russian ancien regime and towards the Germans.     Although an adherent of compromise and strongly averse from all revolutionary methods, he never prostrated himself before the Russians when they were still masters in Warsaw; and on the evacuation of the town by the Russian   armies, he did not fly, as did most of the leaders of the Right, but stuck to hie post, worked hard for the alleviation of the sufferings of the city of Warsaw and on many occasions stood up to the Germans in its defence.    Provided, a really able statesman is found for the post
of Premier, Prince Lubomirski ought to make a very good member of the Regency Council.Count Joseph Ostrowski, a big landowner from the Austrian sphere of occupation and in politics a Realist (the party of which Count Z. Wielopolski was leader), has previously been a member of the Russian Council of Empire.    Re has not taken any prominent part in politics during the war, but is a man who enjoys the confidence not merely of his own class and party, but even of the Radicals. He is very upright and has never been either a time-server or a place-hunter.The Regency Council has now to ohoose a Premier and a Council of State, and until that is done it seems too early to speak about the future policy of the Polish government.    So much, however, can be Baid even now, that both the National Democrats and the Radical-Socialist Left are likely to accept seats in the Council of State, though it seems much less probable that representatives of either group will enter the Cabinet.    As far as one can judge at present, a fair measure of success might be achieved by the government provided it insists on summoning at tho earliest possible date a Diet elected on an honost democratic system.    But it is not at all certain that this will be done, and if the Premier resembles in type the members of the Regency Council the copying of something like Prussian constitutional models seems more likely than the adoption of manhood suffrage.     Should any part of Lithuania be united to Poland even more trickery with constituencies and franchises is certain to result, and East Galician methods are likely to be applied, which though less &quot;thorough&quot; than those of the Magyars resemble them in principles, or rather in their absence.The- Puture of Lithuania.Following on the resolutions passed towards the end of August by tho Main Committee of the German Reichstag and favouring some measure of self-government for Lithuania and Courland, the Germans
are preparing to set up local councils in these provinces.     It is certain that whatever measure of &quot;autonomy&quot; is oonoeded to dottrland its government will be handed over to the small olique--of the notorious German &quot;Baltic Barons&quot;, whilst the Letts who form almost 90 per cent of the population will receive a merely nominal share in it.    The problem^ of Lithuania is by far more oomplidated. Its western districts are inhabited by Lithuanians., a nation very closely related to the Letts, its eastern districts by White Russians, who are a branch of the Russian nation.    In the centre round Vilna there are also some small Polish enolavee, whilst a very large proportion of the big landed estates throughout the country is owned by Poles.    The Gerjzans are not likely to meet the Polish demand and deliver into their hands the whole of Lithuania; because (1) should the Russians agree to oede Lithuania, the Germans are likely to try to keep a more direct hold on its western districts, which form a link between Prussia and Courland.     (2) but should   the Germans have to return these districts to Russia, they will try to inculcate first in the Lithuanians the idea of a national Lithuanian State so as to prepare trouble for the Russians; whereas by handing them over to the Poles they would change every single Lithuanian into a convinced pro-RuBsian.On the other hand the Germans may possibly oede to Poland the eastern districts of Lithuania, i.e. those inhabited by White Russians^because it is absolutely inconceivable that Russia should ever renounce them; thus their possession would in the words of Herr Gothein, a member of the Reichstag, put Poland into &quot;a permanent natural antagonism to Russia&quot;.A meeting of representatives of the different Lithuanian political parties was summoned by the Germans to Vilna for September 17.     The Lithuanians accepted the invitation on con-dition that they were allowed to get first into touch with the Lithuanians abroad and in Russia, and to that purpose delegates
L.B.N.4/10/17.are reported to have &quot;been sent to Stockholm.     According to a German wireless received on September 27 the Vilna Assembly elected a delegation which asked the German administration that the Lithuanians should be allowed to co-operate with it &quot;for the alleviation and amelioration of the sufferings of the population and for the development of the economic condition of the people&quot;. &quot;To this endi&quot; the wireless goes on to quote the Lithuanian delegates, riItWill be our consideration (care?) that all the people of our country shall (should?) share the rights which the inhabitants of cultured States have long enjoyed&quot;.    The request of which the form and contents had been no doubt prescribed by the German authorities, was naturally granted, and it is announced that the Council (Landesrat) elected by the Lithuanian Assembly is to be completed by the inclusion of Polish, German, frewMMfr. White Russian and Jewish representatives.    Judging from the phraseology of the petition, this Council is to have a philanthropic rather than a political character.    The territorial limits prescribed to it, whatewer they may be, need not therefore necessarily pre-judge the future settlement of Lithuania, although they would probably afford a presumption in that direction.    The fact that White Russian and Polish delegates are to be included in the Council does not however so far preclude the possibility of largo parts of the governments of Grodno and Vilna being handed over to the Poles.    The city and district of Vilna itself are almost certain to be included in this now Lithuanian State v/hich alone would Justify some Polish arid White Russian representation in its council.
