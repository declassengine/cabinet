(This Document Is the Property of15His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government)THE RESIDENCY RAMLEH EGYPT.High Commissioner for Egypt e7th September 1917.&quot;&quot; I)ear Sir William. Robertson,I have just returned from two days visit atGeneral Allenby^ invitation to his Headquarters near Khan Yunes, and I write to toll you how very favourably i was impressed by all I saw.to appreciate the difficulties that have been encountered in Sinai and increased my wonder at the successful manner in which they have been met and overcome.enormous amount of work - and real good work - which has evidently been done in the past few months, and the results far exceeded my expectations.good both as regards construction and management and the efficiency of the forward communications may be gauged from the fact that in two days I was able to see the greater part.of the front and to motor through most of the camps and depots behind the lines,     Evidences of clever adaptation to local conditions and complete readi-ness and efficiency met me at every turn, and it must be sheer joy to any soldier who has become inured to trench warfare to note the mobility of the various units and supply services and to see the preparations for an advance.My experience of desert campaigns enahled meI confess I had never fully realized theThe railway east of the Canal is remarkablyEven
Even on a flying visit we could not fail to be impressed by the - excellent &apos;tone&apos; of the army, by the careful optimism of the senior officers, the keenness of their subordinates and the confident bearing and fitness of the men.     I talked to men of the Egyptian Labour Corps in several places and was glad to hear they too are pulling their weight.     Their physical appearance and con--versation show that their treatment leaves nothing to be desired.It was a rare pleasure to me - as I told General Allenby - to get away from the office stool and to see something of this fine army in the field and I have brought back with me the strongest impression of its confidence and power.     I found its gallant Commander&quot;in-Chief as delightful as a host as he is distinguished as a soldier, and spent two very pleasant and interesting days in his company.Yours very sincerely, (Sd)   R.Wingate.General Sir William Robertson, G.C.B., K.C.V.O., D.S.O., &amp;cChief of the Imperial General Staff,War Office,LONDON,    S.W.
