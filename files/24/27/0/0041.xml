/o(This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty1 s Government.167WAR CABINET.Hote on Lord Rhondda1 s Memo, on 22nd September (G.T. 2119) on extension of order permitting increase of 33 1/3 in beer output for an addit-ional 3 months.As regards the need for more beer the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries can have no opinion.The urgency of the neea for the retention of all the barley for flour making is primarily a question to be determined by the Food Controller and the Wheat Commission.   It should not, however, be forgotten that the conversion of barley into beer does not involve the loss of all the food it contains.   According to the Committee of the Royal Society by the conversion of barley into flour something like 70/a of the energy is recovered as human food whereas the brewing process only returns something between 59$ and 28$, according as the alcohol in the beer is allowed a food value or not.   Thus the loss of food to the nation involved in brewing is not so great as is often assumed, and is perhaps under the present conditions not enough to justify further reduction in the supply of beer.The addition of 33 1/3 (on 10,700,000 barrels) is equivalent to 3j600,000 barrels a year roughly or to 143,000 tons barley 17,000 tons sugar.The barley at 50$ milling would yield less than 5 days1 normal consumption of flour.The sugar amounts to less than a week*s supply at present rates of consumption, being approximately 5 days1 supply.(3d) R.E. Prothero.Board of Agriculture, 28th September 1917.
