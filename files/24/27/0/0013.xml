XS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY !S GOVERNMENT),   jqjJ113.WAR CABINET..ECONOMIC OFFENSIVE.Memorandum by Brig. General H. Page Croft, C.M.G.. M.P.,15, Southwell Gardens,S. W. 7.Dear Sir,Sept. 21st, 1917.I forward herewith a Memorandum on the economic weapon in. connection with the war and I should be grateful if you would lay this Memorandum before the Cabinet,     One or two Members of the Cabinet have already been shown a memorandum on similar lines.I have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sd)Henry Page Croft.The Secretary to the Cabinet,M E H 0 R A N D U M*,       x PRESENTED TO THE CABINET by BRIGADIER-GENERAL H.PAGE CROFT,C.M.G.-&apos;      : &apos;-mTFTOwing to the uncertainty of the situation in Russia it appears that a military decision is unlikely until the Armies of America have been trained and conveyed to France,   As it is improbable that a great American Army will be able to take an active part In the Western operations until the late summer of 1918, it would appear advisable to endeavour to reach a decision by other means.There would appear to be one weapon which, so far, has not been used, which would be quite certain of success, and that is the economic one.The writer proposes that a Conference of the whole of the belligerent Allies and also those Countries and States which have abandoned their neutrality, should be held at an early date, and that the following policy should be adopted.That for every month that Germany continues the war and refuses to accept the terms of the Allies the whole of the allied countries undertake to exclude German goods and German shipping for a complete year in any of the territories or ports of the Allies,    The result of this would be that supposing the first announcement was made on Oct. 1st then for every completed month that Germany continues the war Germany would be ostracised from entry into the markets of the outside world for a year:   in other words, if Germany continued the war for six months then for six years she would be crippled.
Once this policy is adopted it must be taken up in deadly earnest and at the conclusion of every, month the Ambassadors of all the Allied Powers should meet together in London and solemnly sign a declaration for the exclusion of German produce and ships for an additional year.As the territory concerned will include the. whole of the British Empire, the United States of America, the principal .,-Republics of South America, the Chinese Empire and Japan, as well as Russia, Prance and Italy, it will be at once seen that Germany would be completely deprived of all her principal markets.If this policy ie adopted in spite of the opposition of those Cosmopolitan financiers who desire restoration, the., result will be complete victory instead of a stalemate peace, the saving of financial credit of the Allies, and also, in all probability, of some three million human lives;The same policy would   sf course be applied to Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey, but it would be made perfectly-&apos; clear to these countries that if either or all of them chose to renounce their military alliance with Germany and to make a separate peace, they would then be   excluded from the operation, of this economic decision , thus for the first time we should have a real strong diplomatic argument for detaching the Allies of the   German Empire.The man in the street is unable to understand why the War Cabinet has not used a weapon such as that one here proposed to back the military power of the Allies and yet it would seem that it is the one argument which the German Empire would understand, and in the opinion of those who have discussed this matter with the writer, it is a policy which must prove successful..In the event of one or two States refusing to join in such a policy, the effect would be equally disastrous to Germany if three-quarters of the Allied Powers joined together in such an economic decision and the British Empire alone, toj shutting the whole of its coaling.Stations and Ports to the German flag and such neutral bottoms aB carry German goods, could bring the German Empire; to its knees.When men die like flies it is inconceivable that any financial interest or sentimental idea should prevent the adoption of such a policy forthwith.
