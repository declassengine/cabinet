/This Document is the PropertyHIntelligence Bureau,Department of Information. BAY//016,Weekly Report onon Austria-hun^ary. XVI.(22nd September, 1917.)The political situation in Austria and in Hungary is as uncertain as ever.     The Austrian Parliament is announced to meet again in a few days, though there are periodical rumours of a further postponement.     The Hungarian Parliament has already met, though practically no details have reached this country regarding the opening sittings.A Survey of the Crisis.   The Esterhazy Cabinet, though only appointed late in May, showed signs almost at once of progressive paralysis.     The Premier himself lacked the necessary Parliamentary experience, and in his desire to conciliate evei/body offended no one but also won no whole-hearted support from any side.     He failed in his original intention of detaching sufficient members from the Tisza party to secure him a majority in the House: and TiBza virtually maintained a secend government behind the scenes. Esterhazyfs position grew steadily impossible, any advance being blocked by the solid phalanx of the Tisza party with whom many of his own adherents secretly sympathised; while the difficulties of appealing to the country under present conditions are so glaring as to make even the most ardent advocates of reform hesitate.     Hence the idea of a compromise with Tisza on the all-important question of electoral reform, ann this appears to have been favoured by Count Appcnyi, the most influential member of the Cabinet.     But it was of course strongly opposed by all the Radical and Socialist elements,, as also by Count Karolyi&apos;6
i - 2 -little group.     Early in August the chief official cbampi-n of reform, Mr. Vazsonyi, Minister of Justice, made a public attack upon Tisza and emphatically declared against modifying the pro-j acted reform.     Rumours of a crisis cropped up daily, and were strengthened &quot;by the isMe of an official denial of its existence (14th August).     There wore continual visits of Hung-irian politicians to Vienna, but strangely enough the names of seme, not all, were deleted by the censor even in the official Fremdenblatt.     On 18th August a Cabinet reconstruction was announced, by which the Clerical leader, Count Aladar Zichy, became minister a latere, while his predecessor, Count Batthyany, and Mr. Vazoonyi remained in the Cabinet without portfolios, presumably to hold a watching brief for reform.Andrassy^ Rejection.     By this time the whole of Hungary \7as treating Count Andrassy as the certain successor of Iiisterhazy; but suddenly on 20th August Dr. Wekerle&apos;s appointment was announced. It is not yet clear what happened behind the scenes, but a week later the Radical Vilag created a profound sensation by announcing that the three Joint Ministers (foreign Affairs, Pinance and V/ar) threatened to resign if Andrassy were appointed.     Andrassy *s own organ repeated the story, hinting that Count Czernin himself was responsible, and professing inability to understand Czernin&apos;s motives, in view of the fact that Andrassy stands for a close alliance with Germany and is opposed to the idea of separate peace. It almost seemB as though Andrassy aimed at conveying the impression that Czernin held different views as to alliance and peace, and so at rendering Berlin suspicious of him.     On the other hand the Vienna correspondent of the Frankfurter Zeitung, Herr Ganz, who is always extremely -well-in formed, states that it was not Czernin, with whom Andrassy is on the best of terms, but Tisza&apos;8 friend Burian, who prevented tue appointment; and he adds mysteriously that Andrassy recently committed a mistake (though &quot;the time was
not yet come to speak of it&quot;) which makes his selection for the moment impossible.     On the top of all this, Count Andrassy announced in the press that he would give his full support to the new Premier in pushing through electoral reform.The lew Premier.     Dr. Weketfle is a veteran&quot; of Hungarian politics and holds a unique position.     He is 69 and hab already thrice been Premier.     During his first tenure of office he carried through the currency reform and  he so-called Church Laws ( re mixed marriages,; etc.) which in their day produced a kind of Kulturkampf.     As an old Liberal, he became Premier in the notorious Coalition government of 1906, Which came in on a platform of universal suffrage, and spent nearly four years in deliberately delaying and burking the reform.     He is the &quot;slimmest&quot; politician in Hungary, whom no one has ever managed to catch unawares, and he is skilled in the management of men and parties.     Politically his great asset is that he is the Dualist who is most acceptable to the Independence parties.     But in present circumstances a still greater asset lies in the fact that he is one of the strongest financial talentb in Europe, and therefore the best hope for restoring the shattered financial credit of Hungary.     His appointment must also be regarded as a re-affirmation of the Dual System, and as he is known to favour the conclusion of a twenty years&apos; Ausgleich and close relations with Germany, hi3 selection can hardly fail to be acceptable in Berlin.     It would also seem probably that one reason for the exclusion of Andra^ssy is the strong line which he has taken upon the Polish Question, which is still the subject of delicate negotiations between Vienna and Berlin.Wekerle*3 Programme.     Thus \7ekerle&apos;s appointment has a double motive - on the one hand to strengthen public confidence by ex-ploiting his great financial and economic reputation, and on the other hand ta further the cfcancee of mediation between the pafctied. Hone the less his selection seems to have taken public opinion
completely by surprise and he has had a very cold and reserved reception in the press. / Throughout the crisis there are indications of fresh oscillations from one political tendency to slather on the part of the Emperor-King, whose knowledge and experience notoriously fall short of his good intentions.     Dr. Wekerle at once announced that his main aim will be the immediate realisation of electoral reform, and the Zeit alleges that he had. to give written guarantees to carry through 32sterhazyfs programme without any compromise.     The Radical reform bloc, which was at first frankly suspicious, decided to give it support; and Mr. Vazsunyi has announced that he remains in the Cabinet on two conditions, acceptance of the old programme and a pledge to dissolve Parliament if a majority cannot be obtained. Within the first week Dr. Wekerle was quoted by the Heue ffreie Presse as opposed to further delay for the franchise, on the significant ground that such delay would help Radicalism, which &quot;tampers with the fsundations of the Magyar Unitary State and attacks the roots of Dualism&quot;.     If the new Premier really said this, it is obvious that his relations with the Radicals cannot be very cordial: and the statement certainly accords with his temporising tendency. Altogether the prospects of the new government are by no means promising: for its internal unity is very largely fictitious, resting as it does quite as much upon personal hates and jealousies as upon political principles.     If any one can detach the corrupt and venal tail of the Tisza party, Dr. Wekerle with his long experience can do so.     But if such methods should prove necessary, it will not be a happy augury for a new regime, and it is difficult to Bee hew any other method can succeed in 3uch an atmosphere.ffinancian. Situation.     Tne Hungarian Minister of Finance, Dr. Grata, in an interview, announced that the Budget expenditure will amount to three milliards of croY/ns, the increase on the previous year being 260 million ( 11,000,000).     It is hoped to raise thiB by new and increased taxes on income, oil, petrol,
textiles and war profits, and also upon all trusts and combinations. Dr. Gratz frankly admitted that the currency can only be improved by reforms extending over a certain number of years.     He said that he would net be afraid, if necessary, to commandeer gold ornaments and to forbid the import of certain luxuries.Statistical Revelations.-   Hungary, unlike other countries, is publishing important birth and &amp;eath statistics for the period of the war, which are in the nature of a revelation.     It is difficult to understand the motives Of publication unless it is definitely desired to increase the peace movement.     Some of the figures have already been published in the Morning.Post, but far more startling and detailed are those given by Dr. Racz, a well* known statistical authority, in the Radical Vilag.   He states quite positively:-   &quot;Hungaryfs losses alone (i.e. exclusive of Austria * R.W.S.W.) in heroic deeds are reckoned at 700,000 to the end of 1916.    JJor can we aB yet even approximately count the number of incurables, cripples unfit for work and deaths hastened by war privations&quot;.     He then shows that the annual number of births, which was already falling before the war, has dropped from 746,000 (or 34,7 per cent) in 1914 to 333,000 (or 15,6 per cent) in 1916 *-i.e. by more than half.     Meanwhile the number of deaths among the civilian population has only fallen from 506,000   in 1914 to 428,000 in 1916 - which in reality means a terrible increase of mortality, in view of the fact that the greater proportion of the huge number   of BOldiers killed at the J3*ont has to be added to the latter figure, and that the tremendous drop in the birth-rate proves infant mortality to have contributed far less to the total of deaths than in previous years.     It appears that while in 1914 the excess of births over deaths in the civil population was 240,000, there was in 1916 an excess of deaths over births amounting to 94,000. Altogether on the basis of these statistics it is probably safe to reckon upon a decrease of about a million In the total population

The chief medical health officer of Budapest in a press interview declared that it was &quot;little short of a miracle11 that Budapest had not hitherto been visited by a real epidemic of dysentery, such as Berlin and Vienna had suffered from.      he Vienna- epidemic is known to us from the press, but that in Berlin has, I believe.,..hitherto been kept dark.22/9/17.
