OPERATIONS 89r.....From : General Barter, Russia. 21.9.17.To     : C.I.G.S., War Oflice.1264 cipher.I returned to Stafka to-day.     Kcrenski is hare, hut leaves to-morrow.   Have induced foreign representatives to interview lierenski before his departure to obtain categorical statement as to his military policy.     Personally I shall point out how it specially affects Great Britain at present moment in view of Mesopotamian operations.In a few days Alexeioff is leaving his post of Chief of the Staff, but may return later.     His departure seems to indicate that he is not satisfied with Kerenskirs programme for the restoration of discipline in the army.     I shall see Alexeioff to-morrow privately.       The address of General Verkhovski, new Minister of war to the Committee in Petrograd two days ago, disparages superior officers very injudiciously, and gives no indication of firm measures.      The only favour-able symptom lni the Governmentrs present military policy is said to be, promotion of promising officers, no matter how young, to command formations, and removal of all officers to whom men can take reasonable exception.     It is to be feared that Kerenski finds that he is losing power in the country, and is disposed to lean supinely on extreme left.To-day Germans attacked Jacobstadt bridge-head as usual Russians ran away.     By to-morrow entire bridge-head will be in German hands.     Enemy appears to be in eonsider-able strength.     They attacked right centre of bridge-head, and not north of it thus giving the impression that they mean to occupy line of Dvina.   Forces being concentrated against Hvinek.
