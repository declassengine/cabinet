Gobneljinw^^IfKirB^Wient is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.!I Printed for the War Cabinet.   September 1917.NAVAL WEEKLY APPRECIATION-No. 17. Week ended 16th September. NAVAL OPERATIONS.There are no important movements of any of the enemy main fleets to record.A minesweeping operation and reconnaissance was carried out in enemy minefields off Heligoland by a strong force from the Grand Fleet with the object of inviting the enemy to give battle.   This he did not do and no enemy forces were sighted.Some &quot;deep mines have been laid off the North-East coast of England.Light forces from Harwich have captured, off the coast of Holland, one Dutch and four Swedish ships which were employed in carrying German coal to Sweden.On the 6th September a German Explosive Motor Boat was sunk in the North Sea by Monitor &quot; M. 23.&quot; The Belgian Coast Patrol were engaged in their daily routine work, guard-ing the Net Drifters and from daylight onwards an enemy seaplane hovered about low, being frequently driven away by gunfire, and finally disappeared, a 7&apos;5 inch shell having burst rather close to him. Three to four aeroplanes were also observed high over on two occasions, 2i hours and just before the attack. Shortly after the disappearance of the seaplane the motor boat was observed coming out at high speed from the southward. Directly after it had passed the Net Drifters, who thought it was a Coastal Motor Boat, &quot; M. 23 &quot; opened fire at 4,000 yards, and going full speed ahead, shot it at 400 yards, as it was crossing her wake. The enemy aeroplanes went away landwards after the Motor Boat had blown up.Bombing Squadrons from Dunkirk have carried out raids on Bruges Docks, Thourout Railwav Junction, railway objectives in the vicinity of Ghent, ammunition dumps at Thourout and Engel, also on the Aerodromes at Thourout, Houttave, Sparappelhoek, St. Denis Westrem, Gontrode and Ghistelles. A bombing attack was also carried out on the shipping alongside the Mole at Zeebrugge, a direct hit being made on a large Destroyer, and several direct hits on Seaplane sheds and the Mole, causing a fire. Further bombing raids were carried out on the 14th and 15th September, when the total weight of bombs dropped was about 15 tons. Full details have not yet been received, but one enemy aeroplane was driven down out of control, and destroyed, and in addition one machine was brought down in our lines almost intact, the pilot and observer being made prisoners. All our aeroplanes returned safely.The Rear-Admiral, iEgean, reports that the gas works, factories and warehouses in the vicinity of Smyrna Railway Station were attacked by bombing squadrons, consisting of eight machines, on the night of 13th September, with good results. It is reported that these works are in use as a munitions factory and submarine base.ATTACK UPON ENEMY  SUBMARINES.The number of enemy submarines believed to have been operating, and their area of Number oforations during the week, appears from the following table	Numbers Operating.

Actions with enemyThe encounters with enemy submarines in Home Waters show a reduction in number, but o&apos;ne submarine is known to have been sunk. The sinking of a submarine off Fairlight on the 4th August, which was not previously reported, is also a certainty.The following table shows the number of actions with enemy submarines in Homet Z Lna Waters during recent weeks and the nature of the craft which have engaged them submarines. ^ to 0Nature of Craft.

The daily&apos;average of British tonnage sunk for the week is 20 per cent, less than the daily average for August, which was the lowest daily average of any month since the commencement of unrestricted submarine warfare.The following is a comparative statement of the number of all British merchant Areas in vessels sunk, damaged or molested, and of all Allied and Neutral merchant vessels sunk which in recent weeks, by submarine and mine according to areas :  - . vessels lost.

The diagram is given in order to illustrate graphically that the ratio of British to Allied and Neutral losses has remained almost constant throughout the period of unrestricted submarine warfare, and that Norwegian losses were greatly in excess of those of any country other than Britain, except in August, when the Italian losses considerably exceeded the Norwegian. The serious esults to Norway thereby illustrated may be of especial interest.CONVOYS.832 ships have been convoyed this week as compared with 905 last week and 850 the previous week.   5 of these were lost as against 3 last week and 9 the previous week.The losses this week are 4 ships of the Scandinavian-Lerwick-Humber convoy and 1 engaged in the French coal trade. Two of these, however, were sunk by mine. In addition, two vessels in the outward convoy were torpedoed, but were towed into port.

It was directed mainly against Scandinavian Convoys at Lerwick and shipping in the War Channel between Lowestoft and Thames, including the Dutch trade.   No losses of merchant vessels, however, occurred in the War Channel.Merchant vessels were lost off Lerwick, Pendeen and Lizard, and two others were damaged off Lerwick.A Minesweeper was also lost of! Lerwick and another off South wold.The total number of merchant vessels fitted with Otter equipment is now 394, and the total number of warships fitted with Paravane equipment is 263.The following table shows the number of enemy mines destroyed and British vessels sunk by mine : Week Ended.August 19th   ..,,    26th   ..

MOVEMENTS OF GERMAN &quot; VESSELS.Merchant ships to and from Norwegian Ports : Arrived, 6 ; Left, 5. ,, ,, ,,     Rotterdam: Nil.A German Raider, believed to be the S.S. &quot; Wolf,&quot; was reported to have been near Rossel Island (S.E. of New Guinea) on the 12th August. She had not previously been heard of since the 2nd May when she was reported S.W. of New Zealand. A cruiser has been sent to Rossel Island to investigate this report.RUSSIAN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE. Baltic.One enemy cruiser with four destroyers attempting to enter the Gulf of Riga, on September 8th, were driven back by the five inch guns of the Russian batteries at Swalfer Ort (completed this April on the Sworbe Peninsula); and two days later the increased number and activity of enemy-minesweepers in the entrance to the Gulf of Riga was considered by the Russian Naval Staff to be preliminary to large naval operations. The sweeping operations were, howevpr, stopped by bad weather and up to the end of the week the naval situation in the Baltic had not appreciably developed. Our Naval Attache at Petrograd anticipated&apos; that both the Baltic and Black Sea Fleets would as a whole be against General Korniloff.Before leaving Riga and Duenamuende the Russians destroyed the Docks there, but the quays and most of the sheds and factories are undamaged. There are no naval establishments at Riga, but torpedo craft are sent there for repairs at the private yards.Black Sea.At Nicolaev the Chief Directors of both the shipbuilding firms have resigned and other Directors are sending in their resignations.- The works are at present under the manage-ment of Workmen&apos;s Committees, and the International Bank has refused to advance them money while this regime continues.The Navales yard was closed down for two weeks by decision of the Committee and there is possibility of abandoning all work on warships. If they re-open they are likely to concentrate on building locomotives and wagons.FRENCH NAVAL INTELLIGENCE. Operations.There have been no operations worthy of mention this week in the Channel or theBay.Patrols.The French Patrols are gaining in strength and efficiency ; 21 American Armed Yachts  shortly to be increased to 33 are working with the French Patrol Service two &quot; esquadrilles de chasse &quot; of Destroyers and Sloops have been organised ; the numbers of Patrol Craft are increasing; new Air Patrols are being established, a Naval Air Service (including Kite Balloons) is being rapidly developed as an essential arm of the Sea Service and close co-operation between Sea and Air Patrols may be looked for.Especially good results are anticipated from the energy of the American Officers, and their determination to safeguard their Troops and Transports by insisting on efficient patrolling and sweeping. British minesweepers are being sent to take over the sweeping of the approaches to Cherbourg and Havre as well as part of the Boulogne Coast.Coast Defences.Numerous armed stations have been established along the coast of Brittany and in the Mediterranean. It would not appear that these will be of great use, as it is not in the interests of the enemy submarines to approach to within range of them. No case has been reported of enemy submarines being fired on by these batteries.
SOUTH AMERICAN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE.Argentina.The visit of h.m.s. &quot; Glasgow &quot; to Buenos aires on 20th instant should give fresh stimulus to the enthusiasm for the Allies which has been increased by the Luxburg revelations. Despatches received this week emphasize the diplomatic importance of the visit of the American Squadron last month. Not much Naval assistance could be looked for from Argentina. she has two modern Dreadnought battleships completed in the United States since the outbreak of war, and presumably in first-class condition, and four modern German-built destroyers, which have turbine defects.   The rest of her Navy is out of date.Uruguay.Negotiations for the confiscation of German sheltering vessels and for the use of Montevideo by H.M. Ships are on the point of being favourably concluded.Peru.The anticipated rupture with Germany as a result of the sinking of the sailing vessel &quot; Lorton &quot; would throw open Callao and other Peruvian ports to our ships and compensate to some extent for our failure to obtain the Panama canal as a base for the Pacific Squadron.TURKISH NAVAL INTELLIGENCE.on the night of 17th-18th August, a raid wras made by the Turks on Kappari and Kalolimni Islands (gulf of Mandelyah). This raid was at first supposed to have been made by enemy submarines, but was subsequently found to be the work of small motor-boats, two or three of which were reported to have been seen in the gulf of Mandelyah.VNaval Staff,20^ September, 1917.
