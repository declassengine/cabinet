From:- G-.O..CMesopotamia,202C.I.G.SWar Office.26.9.17.Repeated C-in-C, India, X.3829.    11.15 p.m.    26th September, 1917. Your 41847 of 24th.   My X.3750 of 21st September was sent as it seemed to me that moment had come when, since Russians instead or promising co-operation as heretofore were now definitely refusing it except on Dialha^we should crystalize our plans for future.     I tried to make it plain by use of such terms as &quot;ultimate offensive&quot; and &quot;Ultimately be possible&quot; as well as by last sentence of my message; that I was considering--future rather than present.     My X. 3750 dealt with two points.First, undesirability in my opinion of drawing in Russians to Dialha under changed conditions for reasons given by me.     This appeared to require early action, in view of Baretoff1s orders to move early.   I note, however, that you consider that we should still endeavour to get Russians to Dialha and I will act accordingly.       Should they get into difficulties I will draw them in towards me so that we may still be able to supply them and this should not be difficult if they will obey orders.   Secondly, in view of dist^ano-e^-jjivul^red.--and time it takes to organize and move &quot;trvops it seemed advisable that we should look well ahead. Except forRussian lapse I am absolutely satisfied with position here. Enemtps concentration is evidently being much delayed.     Hisrailway had only reached Nisibin at commencement of September. His river communications are insufficient for large force.   His land transport will have to contend with long distances andblockade they are finding difficulty in obtaining supplies locally.     Conversely our communications in spite of obviousdifficultiesindifferent roads,Moreover moral of Turkish troops isgenerally indifferent and there is evidence that owing tv our
9 n 20difficulties are working smoothly and satisfactorily.Railroad, river and land transport is well organised and supplies, stores and munitions are ample.   Added to this fighting spirit of our troops is at highest pitch and development of port facilities promises well, namely 5 wharfs, meaning increase of 50% in cargo unloaded monthly in near future and ultimate expansion if found necessary to 17 wharfs over and above those at present existing,    I shall be glad to receive such number of additional 6&quot; Howitzer batteries up to 4 as may be available and the additional Cavalry Brigade nor; promised will be most useful, I fully realise undesirability of stinting Prance to fulfil our requirements here and am most grateful for manner in which all my reasonable demands have been met so promptly.In short, situation here is at present quite satisfactory and I wished to be early representing my views as regards future so that time may be available not only to co-ordinate plans on soundest lines but also to give effectto such of our requirements as it may be found possible to meet,
