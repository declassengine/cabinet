(This Docum mt is thj Property of AO 1 I ;. Operations.Prom:- General Barter, Russia,Sept, 25th,1917. To:-     C .I.G.S. War Office. 1,10 a,m.No. 1272.     24th September,This evening I saw Alexeieff who has refused to continue in office because he is not satisfied that the Korniloff affair is being fairly treated;   because military measures which he considers indispensable are not to be adopted and because he cannot submit to interference of Government commissaries at G.H.Q,.     Alexeieff considers the political situation very critical and is afraid the Bolshevists are going to secure power at once.      He thinks the influence of Kerenski has greatly diminished and that he will be succeeded in power by the present Minister of War, General Verkhovski, almost immediately whom he considers an ambitious and unscrupulous man who is hand in glove with the Petrograd Committee. He fears Bolshevists advent to power may mean endeavours to make separate peace and he points out that the German reply to the Pope1s peace proposal was framed in accordance with proclaimed ideals of the Bolshevists.     He thought however that the Bolshevists Committees outside Petrograd were against separate peace and also that the commonsense of the country would oppose such a project.Refer to my telegram of a week ago from Petrograd relating to my interview with Verkhovskl,Other good authorities consider that the advent of the Bolshevists to power will be temporary only;   and that events will rally all other parties against them with favourable results,Alexeieff considers it of the utmost importance that the most vigorous pressure should be exerted against peace tendency by Ambassadors in Petrograd,Alexeieff expects, from intelligence received to-day, definite military and naval action tomorrow against the islands opposite Pernau and Gapsal when Germans will form a base for further offensive operations against Reval in the spring.These operations will probably coincide with minor landing at Abo and Raumo and with Bolshevist troubles in Petrograd.He thinks also that the Germans will shortly take the offensive from Czernowitz in the direction of Jasy, their immediate object being   Botusany and the railway junction at Fashcani,Strong cavalry forces have been concentrated by the Germans about Vickof and Radovets,He thinks that German operations here will be secondary to that in the north.No news from Jacobstadt.       Some troops fought well there apparently.Repeated to Ambassador,ft Circulated to War Cabinet on 20.9.17.
