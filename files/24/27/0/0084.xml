Italy of 21st September 191?Comando Supremo, Italy.TO THE CHIEF OP THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF.With reference to General Cadorna&apos;8 letter No. 4511G.M. of 21st September and my telegram No. 41$ Of the SOth September, the following may be of interest in Connection with the reasons given by General Cadorna for the postponement of his offensive.taken, I understand, en the 19th. Of this month.      Up to that date the preparations for the continuance of the offensive were being actively pursued in the Hnd and Illrd Armies with manifest confidence in the result.nothing to add to my previous communications on the subject which showed the exact state of the ammunition at Generalwhen I reported the extent ef stocks in hand (telegram No.36-2-)., may perhaps be 150,000 rounds at the most.      As far as I know manufacture is proceeding at the rate reported and the stock brought with the 100 French guns alone would almost make upno new fact as regards ammunition.As regards drafts, I know that General Cadorna has been a good deal concerned at the difficulties which have been raised by the civil government in connection with the provision of the requisite supplies of men.   This is a grave question and is not solved by the Galling out of the largeThe decision was certainly Unexpected and wasAs regards the question Of ammunition, there isCadorna s disposal.The amount expended since 28th August,for the expenditure since 28th August.There is therefore
2. 351numbers of men of ages upwards of 40 years which are to be seen in territorial units all over the country,   These men have proved of little value for fighting, they cannot always be relied upon to maintain order in the country and their employment with the army causes discontent.General Cadorna1s deficiency is in men of the best fighting ages for the field troops.   There were 160,000 men assembled in March battalions as drafts before the last offensive * These have all been absorbed and the ComandoSupremo does not know where to turn ta-fox more.  Officers also are a great difficulty and General Cadorna, has often said that the material from which to improvise officers is not available in Italy to the extent that is the case in England.       At the present moment orders have been given to transfer 170 lieutenant colonels,majors and captains of cavalry to the infantry to command regiments and battalions, while 400 cavalry subalterns are to be transferred to infantry companies at the same time*     &quot;What this will mean to the 30 regiments of cavalry (from which a large number of the best officers had already been taken to serve with machine-guns, as aviators and with the artillery as observers and battery officers with guns and trench-mortars) need not be pointed out.As regards the strength of Infantry units, the 4th companies of the battalions were withdrawn in the spring to form new battalions, but each battalion then had a machine-gun company (6 machine-guns and 230 men) added to it.     Besides this, in each regiment one additional machine-gun company per regiment (8 machine-guns and 250 rank and file) and 6 pistol cartridge machine-gun sections (12 machine guns and 200 rank and file) were formed and also a pack and wheel supply column of 280 men, with mules and carts so as to relieve the troops of the necessity of finding fatigues for supplies and rations.Thus, though the number of rifles per company was reduced to 200 and after the August offensive to 175, the strength of men per regiment remained at about 3,000
3 3 ?0 * *i J Lafter the last reduction.General Cadorna now proposes to break up again some of the brigades of most recent formation,  especially those of 3 regiments, with a view to providing drafts to keep other units up to strength.As regards the losses, of which it is stated the &quot;Allied Higher Command are aware&quot;, the information given confidentially was that the May offensive cost 160,000 casualties and the August one 120,000, making 280,000 in all.   Other minor actions may have cost, accumulatively, a considerable number of casualties, but I do not know how the additional 80,000 would be accounted for.    In any case a large proportion of casualties were slight wounds and probably less than half the total figure would represent permanent loss to the Army,The 360,000 sick referred to is about the usual-proportion of the constant sick in hospital,About 160,000 men are on leave now and in the winter the proportion of men constantly on leave would be increased.Bearing on the question of the difficulties in personnel, it should be noted that the Government have obliged General Cadorna recently to return 10,000 men of the Carabinieri from the War Zone, where they were performing indispensable duties in connection with the discipline of the troops and maintenance of order.     Their place in the War Zone will have to be taken by other well-trained and fighting troops.     Further it is known that in view of the possible recurrence during the winter of troubles (such as those owing to which Turin, Alessandria and Genoa have been recently declared War Zone), the Government will require the return to the interior of the country of a certain number of troops whose discipline can &quot;be relied upon in case strong measures are required for the maintenance of order.   These duties the territorial troops cannot be relied upon to carry out
with the result that troops urgently required at the front will have to be withdrawn for this purpose.As regards the troubles apprehended during the winter, always a season when pessimism is most rife), the chief causes are:    the often-reportod lack of coal, whioh will be very severely felt throughout the country and the Importance of which cannot be exaggerated; the lack of food, of which there is a shortage, aggravated hy the inefficiency of the organisation to regulate distribution, hut which it is hoped to improve hy bread cards, etc., which are to come into use on the 11th. October; and the increasing energy of the pro-German propaganda.       The authorities know that a great deal of German money is circulating in Italy.     An instance sf this is the fact that on 100 of the rioters arrested during the disturbances at Turin, men and boys of the poorest class, a total sum of 37,000 francs was found, largely in Swiss bank notes.In connection with the subject of enemy propaganda and influence in Italy, one of the most satisfactory  &apos; of recent events is the removal of Signor Vigliani, the Chief of the Police, a notorious Giolittian and, from the point of view of the interests of the Allies, a most dangerous agent.Altogether, German propaganda, the action of tho Pope, the shortage of supplies and other causes have resulted in the people of Italy becoming less enthusiastic and whole-hearted in support of the war than it was.Accurate details as to the strength of the Austrian units are of course unobtainable, but the reports beforo the August offensive tended to show that the average strength of the Austrian battalions was somewhere about 700, except in special cases.    The March battalions were known to be weak and it is not clear how the strengt-hs can be much Increased now.     The statement that 562 Austrian battalions equal in strength
702 Italian battalions seems exaggerated, although the strength of the defensive positions occupied by the Austrians reduces the value of a mere comparison in figures.As regards the arrival of fresh Austrian units on the Julian front, the only absolutely new ones reported with certainty are the 20th &amp; 53rd Divisions, the 25th Brigade of the 13th Division and probably the 19th Division. To-day, further, the 7th Division is reported, making   (if this report is correct, which is doubtful) a total additional strength of a little over      new divisions. Other units are vaguely indicated as being on their way, but there is no certainty concerning thorn.The Austrian artillery reinforcement hitherto reported is stated to bo about equivalent to the losses in August,    Consequently in view of the losses suffered in the offensive, the Austrian strength can hardly be greater than on August 15th.As regards the 15 Austrian divisions, with which it is asserted contact has been lost on tho Russian fronta I am not aware what degree of weight must be attached to tho assumption that any of them may be expected on the Italian front or what value, in view of the state of the Russian Army, should be given to the statement that contact with them has been lost on the Russian front.     Information received from British Intelligence sources appears to show that contact has been lost only with the 31st and 61st Landsturm Divisions,while Wo other Austrian Divisions on the Russian&apos; front are believed to be in reserve.The Roumanian army has made a good resistance; the Russian Armies in the South appear less disorganised than those further North and the internal conditions . of Austria seem to be really bad.   It seems doubtful, in view of all the above considerations, whether the Austrians can really undertaice any serious offensive on the Julian front.
In conclusion,, reviewing the possible reasons for General Cadorna&apos;s decisions it is clear that the ammunition difficulty presents no new factor.     Little more than half the present allowance set aside for the offensive has been consumed so that another offensive of equal weight might have been undertaken still leaving intact the ultimate reserve of li million rounds which General Cadorna stated it to be his intention to keep in hand under all circumstances.It has been shewn that the Austrians can be, at present numerically, little, if any, stronger than before. Their morale must have suffered considerably in the last offensive, the positions which they now occupy cannot be as good or as well prepared as those from which they were driven and their artillery fire for some time must be less effective owing to changes of position,, loss of material and incompleteness of registration. Therefore, the present strength of the enemy, in face of the victorious and confident Italian Army, cannot be admitted to be a new factor either.The disintegration of the Russian armies is a process which has been in course for some time.-    There does not therefore appear to be any reason to claim that a new factor has arisen in this direction between Septembe: 11th.,(when General Cadorna discussed the situation at Udine with the Secretary of State and Generals Sir Neville Macready and Maurice) and September 19th., when General Cadorna made his decision to refrain from any further offensive for the time being.The real difficulty would appear to be that drafts are not forthcoming in sufficient numbers to enable General Cadorna to keep the units of the field army at sufficient strength.   For this the Government is no doubt responsiblea   It refrains from insisting on sufficient numbers of men being called up as It fears the growing discontent in the country, due to the causes referred to
0 elabove, and is lacking in sufficient power of control. That the country could supply them men required is patent to anybody spending a short time in any of the larger towns in the interior, where quantities of men of service age are to be seen everywhere.The General Staff states that the reasons for the present decision are military only.       This no doubt is the case if, in General Cadorna&apos;s opinion, the strength at his disposal will not permit him to pursue the offensive at the present time and yet maintain the army at sufficient strength to meet any strong enemy offensive  (which he thinks possible) afterwards.The question of losses is probably one which is making the Government still more nervous.     For these, although carefully concealed, are being made &quot;the most of in the anti-war propoganda of the pacifists and pro-Germans .General Cadorna&apos;s reasons for the decision are authoritative and he has, of course, very carefully weighed all the considerations - some of which he only can know.      He is not likely to reconsider a decision once taken, unless new facts are presented.But it can only be a matter for great regret that the offensive, begun so well, and with such good promise for the future, is not to be pursued. The conditions are all in favour of the Italian army, though they grow less so, of course, as time is given to the enemy to reinforce and consolidate.     If pressed
with the same vigour as before, the Italian offensive would probably have deprived him of all desire to make an offensive on his own account for a long time to come, besides giving the peace party in Austria, which it is believed desires nothing better, an excellent argument for insisting on giving up the struggle.(Signed)   C.
