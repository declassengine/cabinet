(This Document is the Property ofcopy.His Britannic Mafestvfs 0British Naval Liaison Officer in Russia,o/o British Embassy, Petrograd,l/14th September 1917.No. PVR.72.Sir,With regard to the instructions to me concerning War Cabinet Meeting No.203, Minute No.5, of 2nd August 1917, about the possibility of offering naval assistance to the Russian Government, and the order to report on the natter as soon as possible after my arrival in Petrograd, I have the honour to submit the following remarks:2.-    That in the present state of affairs throughout the country it would be utterly useless to attempt anything of the kind.    I have had opportunities of talking with English Officers who are in close touch with the Russian Navy, as well as Russian Officers themselves, as to the state of the fleet generally, and there is no doubt that the lack of discipline is deplorable. Naturally some ships are better than others&apos;,   the destroyers appear to be the best, and the battleships the worst, but all are bad.    They are to all intents and purposes ruled by the men&apos;s committee, which oxists on board each unit-,   this committee decides what shall or shall not be done, and it is a matter of doubt if any order from a higher authority whioh did not meet with the full approval&quot;of the Committee would be carried out. Every sailor is a politician and is swayed by the political events of the moment, and they have little or no respect for their offioers.3.-    In the conditions which prevail it would be an impossible task for any officers of a foreign country to undertake anything in the way of reorganisation.    The spirit of disoipline as we know it is utterly lacking, and in my opinion the restoration of it must come from within.    To attempt to introduce it from any outside source at the present moment would be to court failure.4.-    I have informed the Ambassador of the substance of this letter, with which he entirely agrees.I have, etc...(Sgd)   VICTOR STANLEY.Bear-Admiral, British Naval Liaison Officer in Russia.The Secretary of the AdmiraltyLondon, S.W.I.
