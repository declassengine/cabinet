Memorandum, by the Secretary of,Stat,e for India.                 I circulate for information, with reference to       the  discussion of this question on the 28th January,       copies of, private telegrams exchanged v/ith the Viceroy in       regard to the proposal to make representations in the       name  of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the Government of India       against the imposition of the surcharge.W.B.
Si. K 7TELEGRAM FROM SECRETARY OF STATE TO VICEROY,  DATED               28th JANUARY 1931 -          PRIVATE AND PERSONAL. THE CABINET MAY WISH to address YOUR GOVERNMENT IN THE SAME MANNER AS MAS DONE LASTYEAR, POINTING OUT THE BAD EFFECT ON LANCASHIRE TRADE OF THEPROPOSED SURCHARGE 0F 7,. ON COTTON.  IF THIS COURSE -/EREPURSUED WOULD YOU TELL ME URGENTLY, FIRST, WHETHER such representations WOULD AFFECT YOUR PROPOSALS;  SECOND,WHAT EFFECT WOULD PUBLICATION OF HIS MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT&apos;SREPRESENTATIONS AND GOVERNMENT OF INDIA&apos;S REPLY BE LIKELY TOPRODUCE ON THE ASSEMBLY? THIRD, WHAT EFFECT, IF ANY, WOULD BELIKELY TO BE PRODUCED ON POLITICAL SITUATION GENERALLY BY SUCHPUBLICATION? FOURTH, WOULD IT BE LIKELY TO HAVE ANY EFFECT ONTHE BOYCOTT CAMPAIGN?TELEGRAM FROM VICEROY TO SECRETARY OF STATE,  DATED                   1st FEBRUARY 1931&apos;          PRIVATE AND PERSONAL.  YOUR PRIVATE AND personal telegram 01 28th ULTIMO.  I HAVE DISCUSSED INFORMALLY with members OF MY COUNCIL AND FOLLOWING ARE MY ANSWERS TO YOURQUESTIONS. FIRST, I AM AFRAID THAT WE COULD NOT ALLOW such representations TO INFLUENCE US. SECOND AND THIRD, GENERALEFFECTS IN INDIA WOULD PROBABLY BE BAD.  PUBLICATION of correspondence BETWEEN HIS MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT ANA THEGOVERNMENT OF INDIA WOULD RECALL BAD ATMOSPHERE OF LAST                                                       YEAR&apos;S
year&apos;s controversy and would at the best,  be regarded as  a&quot;put-up job&quot; . Apart from this, any results on balance would be detrimental. The attempt of His Majesty ,:s  Government to deflectGovernment of India in the interests of Lancashire would  createmost unfortunate impression just now.  It  would arouse all  oldsuspicions, and do much to destroy any good impressionscreated at London Conference. As against this, any merit  which government of India might acquire in the eyes of Indian publicopinion for having resisted British appeal would be of negligiblevalue.  In present circumstances, you must remember that  ensinevitable result of Round Table Conference has been to make public regard present Government of India  as an institution doomedto speedy extinction, whose damnation by Indian public opinion has been largely accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government and Britishopinion. Four, I am doubtful if boycott will be much affectedwhatever we do, but, so far as I can estimate effects ofvarious alternatives, my views are as followsj-          (a) There is some chance that our tariff proposals,if accepted without comment, might create more friendlyatmosphere, though the maintenance of 5 ?er cent, differencebetween duties on British and non-British goods will certainly  be criticised.          (b) On the other hand, a protest by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment might have result of stimulating boycott because,apart from arousing resentment, it would shew that Britishinterests are still vulnerable in this respect.          (c) What I feel most certain about  is that, if  we putsurcharge on all goods with sole exception of cotton, this  willgive boycotters an effective new cry.
