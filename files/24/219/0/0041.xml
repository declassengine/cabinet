DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT%TTsi)COPY NO.CABINET.REORGANISATION OF THE COTTON INDUSTRY.Memorandum by the^oge Secretary and the President          of the Hoard of &quot;TrScCS     We circulate for information a Memorandum whichhas been prepared in the Office of the Chief industrialAdviser on the subject of the Reorganisation of the CottonIndustry.  The first part of the memorandum indicates in broad outline the steps that have been taken in Lancashiresince the publication of the Government Cotton Report; thesecond part of the memorandum consists of notes indicating the position that has been reached in regard to the applica-tion to the Cotton Industry of the recommendations in theReport.     The further meetings which we were to have had withthe manufacturers have been deferred for the present owing tothe dispute.  We hope, however, to have an opportunity of meeting representatives of the Joint Committee, who will bein London next week.     In view  of  the  controversy on the eight-loom  question,it may be of  interest  to  draw  attention to the notes  5 and 6which  deal with  the  recommendations made by the Report in&quot;relation  to automatic  and semi-automatic looms; the experiments mentioned  in  these notes  seem to suggest  thatthe  operatives do not  find  the same difficulty in  accepting,say, 20,  30,  or  even 40,  automatic  looms per weaver  as theydo in  accepting  eight  ordinary looms  per weaver.11thFebruary,1931.(J m R c C *W.G.
           REORGAHI BAT I Oil OF THE POTTOS INDUSTRY.     The annexed memorandum indicates in broad outline,particulars of tho steps whloh have been taken in Lancashirein relation to the recommendations contained in the Report ofthe Cotton Enquiry,      In considering the general position in the light ofthis memorandum, the following facts relating to the cottonindustry have to be borne in mind.    2. The cotton industry Is a very complicated industrymaking a vast number of different products.     The trade falls into two main divisions,  (a) yarn,and (b) piece goods.  Piece goods fall into the following maindivisions;   (a) unbleached,grey;   (b) bleached white;(o) printed, and  (d) dyed and woven  of dyed yarn.  It is inthe field of the printed and dyed piece goods that the enormousvariation arises.,  The annexed  list  (Annexe II) gives the broadgroups of the fabrics which are produced;  within each groupthere is a vory large variety of design and quality to meet theneeds of the various markets.   Over  30 per cent, of the outputof the industry is exported, and Lancashire cotton goods go to every corner of the world.  They also have tc be packed Invarious ways to suit the tastes of different people.     The cotton industry is more than one trade;  it  is halfa dozen trades  rolled  into one, and  each of these trades demandsconsiderable technique and experience.  The spinning  of ya-rn  isin itself an art;  the weaving  of  the yarn into cloth is again avery highly  specialised  and difficult operation to perform with commercial success.  The bleaching,  printing and dyeing tradesare also full of  complications  and technical difficulties. Thenagain  the merchanting  of  the goods demands very great knowledge and experience.   The  ramifications and complications  of the
                                                         9F? Q                                                         ij a uindustry are astounding, and like any other delicate piece ofmeohanism it can he more easily upset than put together again.     3.  The Lancashire cotton industry is, of course, in avery depressed state, hut it must not he overlooked that theexport trade in cotton goods is still our premier export trade,that Lancashire is still far and away ahead of her competitorswith regard to the quantity both of yarn and piece goodsexported, and that serious though the effect of the presentdepression has been on the cotton industry of this country,it has been just as serious in &apos;other producing countries.Some trade statistics illustrating this are given in Annexe IV.     4.  Much of the present depression is due to causes over which not only Lancashire but also the Government have no control, and which affect the cotton industry in every country of the world.  The collapse of the prices of primary productshas gravely affected the purchasing power in all the markets of the world, and  this  situation has been aggravated in Indiaand the Par East,  our most important markets, by politicaldisturbance, civil war  and, where currencies are based onsilver, currency depreciation.  In Lancashire the effects  ofthese  factors are widely but erroneously attributed to thereturn to the gold standard.     5.  There is  one problem in the spinning section on whichthe Cotton Report  gives no guidance, but which is now comingvery much to the fore.  That is the problem of&apos;weak selling&quot;.The existing spindleage of the spinning section (both american and Egyptian) greatly exceeds the spindleage for which tradeis, or indeed is ever likely to be, available.  The spinnerwith wages and interest charges to meet, unable to find aprofitable market  for his yarn, may be driven by his need  forcash to sell his product at a loss, for what it will fetoh,
rather than, accumulate stock.   His proper course would heto close down until times improve, hut his standing charges for interest, etc., may he such that he loses less by running at a loss than by closing down altogether.  Thus the weakselling of the needy spinner tends to depress the price ofyarn below the cost of production - a phenomenon seen in otherindustries in these times of depression.  The problem is by nomeans a new one in the cotton trade, and efforts have been madein the past to deal with it by means  of voluntary price fixing,but schemes of this kind are fatally exposed to price cuttingby minorities who refuse to co-operate, as well as by disloyalmembers of the scheme.  In any case, it seems doubtful if pricefixing is the proper remedy.  The weak selling which it seeks toremove is only a symptom of the more deep seated malady -excessive productive capacity - and to remove the symptom isno cure.   The real need is to reduce the productive capacity to a level at which there will be a prospect of profitabletrade for all - leaving a margin, of course, to meet thestimulation in the damand for Lancashire  fabrics which it ishoped will follow  from  the reduction of  costs aimed at byreorganisation and re-equipment.  It is  difficult to gaugethe probable extent of  this excessive productive capacity buta rough estimate has been submitted which may serve to give some idea of the possible magnitude of  the problem - it isthat there are in  all some 14 million surplus spindles -10 million in  the American section and  4 million in theEgyptian section.  Ho doubt there is a  corresponding surplus in  the manufacturing  section  of the industry, but no estimateof the number  of redundant looms  has yet been received.     6.  Amalgamation provides one remedy.  A powerfulcombination  like the Lancashire Cotton  Corporation is  strong-enough  financially to resist  the  temptation to  sell at a loss.   It  runs full time  such Bpindles  as can be profitably
*5 Q a run, keeping the remainder so to speak in cold  storage.If the spinning section were wholly embraced by a  few  suchcombines, and this is the ultimate goal,  they could and would all follow this policy and agree to refrain from out-throatcompetition.   At present it is, of course,  impossible tosecure any such common policy.   Another possibility wouldbe to deal with the matter as the shipbuilding  industry hasdealt with it - namely, by floating a company with thesupport of the industry at large for the purpose of buyingup and scrapping surplus capacity.   In an industry likecotton it would undoubtedly be extremely difficult to  securethe common action necessary to do this.     Schemes designed to deal with the problem  have beenput forward both in the American and Egyptian sections.Both schemes provide for the fixing of &quot;marginal prices&quot;for yarn and for a pool arrangement designed to remove the incentive to run machinery for longer time than theaverage.   The American scheme also contains provisionsdesigned to eliminate redundant spindles, though it is somewhat doubtful whether they would be effective.  it also contemplates legislation under which it would havecompulsory  effect.   It has yet to be accepted by theFederation  of Master Cotton Spinners Organisations.     These  proposals affect every section of the tradeand if they are formally adopted by the Spinners,  they willhave to be  examined by the Joint Committee of Cotton trade organisations, as representing the trade as a whole.   not until  this  has been done can the attitude of the Governmentbe  defined.     7. The recommendations of the Report are dealt with
                                                      Colin the annexed memorandum under the  following headings:-       1. The Government  should urge Lancashire to           consider the means  of reducing  costs of           production recommended in the Report.     Raw material.       2. Use of Indian Cotton.     Re-equipment.       3. Use of Indian Cotton - Alteration of           cardroom machinery.       4. Ring spinning,  high  drafting and high-speed           winding.       5. Automatic Looms.       6. Automatic Looms - double shifts.     Reorganisation.       7. (a^ Spinners;   and          (b) Manufacturers.       8. Finishers.       9. Merchants.     Co-operative Action.      10. Work of the Joint Committee of Cotton Trade           Organisations.      11. Trade Missions.     8. Satisfactory progress  has been made underheadings 1, 10 and 11.   As the memorandum shows,  theGovernment has taken all  possible steps to urge upon thecotton industry the need  for a prompt and  closeconsideration of the recommendations in the Report.     It will be seen that the  work of the  Joint Committeeis rapidly developing and that the position of thatrepresentative body is being consolidated  in the  industry.     With regard to Trade Missions (heading ll),  thememorandum shows that the Government have  lost  no time  in giving effect to the views expressed in the Report.
     9. As to the use of Indian Cotton (heading 2),  itseems possible that in the Report sufficient credit  may nothave been given to Lancashire for her efforts to make use  ofa cheap raw material.   Moreover, the cost of the necessarynew machinery is considerable,  and progress in re-equipmentmust go hand in hand with the re-grouping of productive units.It would be a mistake to provide financial facilities  forthe unco-ordinated re-equipment of small units,  and  there  isnot likely to be any difficulty in obtaining finance forre-equipment in connection with sound schemes of amalgamation.This consideration applies also in regard to the recommendations for improvement of machinery dealt with under headings 3,  4,5 and 6,   Once a general movement towards combination is  inprogress, any necessary improvement in plant and equipment will follow.   In the meantime, useful preliminary work Isbeing done, especially with regard to automatic looms.,     10. On the question of reorganisation, Lancashire,broadly speaking, has still to learn the advantages  which  canbe obtained by amalgamations.   In point of fact, itsexperience with amalgamations in the past has not beenaltogether- a happsr one.   There were a number of unfortunatecompany-promoting cases during the boom period some  ten yearsago.   Lancashire^ success in the past has been built up  on individual effort and many of her people still believe thatthe best hope of success in her intricate main industry lies in the unit to which a skilled spinner or weaver, as the  case may be, can devote his personal and unremitting attention.However, Lancashire is certainly awaking to the fact that  someof her age-old methods will have to be discarded and thatsuccess in the overseas markets can only continue if theindustry is organised on rather different lines.
                                                          9pg                                                      .    (J O ej      11.  As to  the form  of amalgamation best suited to the cotton industry,  opinions differ.  Perhaps  the weight of opinion  is at present  in  favour  of the horizontal amalgamation, such  as  the Lancashire Cotton Corporation.  But there are successful amalgamations  of a vertical character, e.g., the Tootal Broadhur3t Lee  Company, and it is very doubtful whether one can  lay down any hard and fast rule.  There is probably, room  in  the industry  for  both horizontal and vertical amalgamations.   The Lancashire Cotton Corporation itself has secured possession of a large number of looms and will no doubt weave  as well as spin --it  is in fact doing some weaving  at the  present time.      Again, amalgamations of merchants with weavers would seem  to  offer  a good  chance of success, and the possibility of action along these  lines is being explored,      12. AS  to the  size  of an amalgamation, the Lancashire Cotton Coz^poration&apos;s  avowed objective is some 10,000,000 spindles and  at the  same  time the Corporation has acquired upwards  of 20,000 looms.   The opinion has been expressed that an amalgamation should not embrace more than 4/5,000,000 spindles at  the outside,  if it is to be efficiently run.      Factors  in this  problem  appear  to be:-      (i) That  as a  combine increases in size a hierarchy of           rail! managers, of  managers of groups  of mills,  and           of  a headquarters  general and specialist  staff, must            come into  being and the  central  control must become           more and more  divorced from the  individual mill.           Lancashire believes,  and  the belief is not           unreasonable,  that there  must In such circumstances           be  some  loss of efficiency.    (ii) On  the other hand,  the  combine  should achieve            economies  and  increased  efficiency by dealing            in bulk with  raw  material, in  stores and the
                                                          *J O M,                                                          (j O &apos;ii       manufactured article, and by cutting out certain       intermediaries.   And by specialisation and       standardisation of manufacture the combine should       obtain economies in production.       13. The Report of the Cotton Enquiry affords no  guidance on the problem of the type or size of amalgamation,  and endeavour is being ms.de to ascertain what views are  hold  in the industry.   It seems probable that,  whilst the large  group may be the proper one for the manufacture of standard  cloths,  something smaller might be better for the higher  quality branches of the trade.       14. The most urgent problems in regard to amalgamation  centre on the weaving.and, in a lesser degree,  on the  opinning sections of the industry.   with  regard to the.  finishers and merchants, the former are combined to a  considerable extent already, and among the merchants there  are already a number of large and efficient units.    The  problem here is rather to devise some stronger link than at  present  exists between the producing and the marketing ends  of the industry.       Spinning mills organised in large units,  actually  formed or in prospect, account for about 30?- of the total  spinning section and, &quot;-hen due allowance is made for concerns  which probably must become redundant (see paragraph 5),  the  percentage approaches 40.   From these figures it will be  seen, appreciable progress towards reorganisation has been  made in the spinning section.       15. But  very little has as yet been done in the  weaving section.   Some of the difficulties are mentioned  under heading: 7(b) in the annexed memorandum,  but one of  them must be stressed.       The terms which are being offered by the  Lancashire Cotton Corporation to almost bankrupt units in                             -S-
                                                       &amp; o Jthe weavers, who are not in such desperate straits.  Butas yet these are the only terms which have been published toLancashire and consequently it is most difficult to persuade the majority of weavers even to listen to discussions of amalgamation.  A scheme is, however, being worked out foran amalgamation of certain manufacturers and it may beanticipated with some confidence that if this scheme issuccessfully launched and is seen to provide se,tiefactorilyfor the merging of solvent concerns, It will quickly befollowed by others.     In the meantime a close study is being made ofthe layout of this section of the Industry and what is moreimportant, an endeavour Is being made, in consultation withleaders of the industry, to arrive at some solution of the difficult problems mentioned above with regard to the formand size of amalgamations.   IS. The Cotton Report furnished no plan of reorganisation and many fundamental points have to besettled before one can be drawn up.  Should the objectivebe an amalgamation of weavers, or of merchants and weavers,or of spinners and weavers, or variants of these three-courses for particular sections of the trade?   These arevital questions and  the time taken by the weavers in making up their minds to  the necessity for reorganisation, Is beinfwell spent in obtaining the ideas of the more  progressivemembers of the industry as to  the form the reorganisationshould take.  Clearly the mere aggregation of  units affordsby itself no real  solution of  the present difficulties;the unfortunate experiences of some of the existing combinesprovide evidence  of  this.  A  scientific basis  ofcombination yielding the maximum production economies  isrequired, and it  may be that  an appropriate basis  for  one
section of the ^trade is entirely inappropriate for other sections.     Further, the finanoial structure of the combine must hesound.    Certain otherwise promising combinations have in thepast started hopelessly handicapped by over-capitalisation,but if this danger is to be avoided, the value of the assetsbrought in. will have to be written down, a painful orocessinvolving-delicate negotiation.    Further, the most impartialseleotion of pivotal men is vital to the success of any largeorganisation, but often creates personal difficulties of avery intractable kind.   The sucoessful management of a largecombime creates entirely fresh problems of administrationfor whioh there is little or no precedent or experience inthis&apos; country.    It involves a technique which has hardly been developed at all here, and it calls for a controllingadministration of an exceptional calibre.  One of the greatestdifficulties in regard to the formation of a combine is to finda man capable of running it.   There is no doubt that in theconditions of to-day hastily improvised combinations,overcapitalised or lacking the right personnel, would stand noohance of success, and would even make the position worse thanit is at present.
*5 q nCJ O $                    COTTON REPORT.     The following notes indicate broadly the position whichhas been reached in regard to the application by the CottonIndustry of the Recommendations in the Cotton Report.lc  RECOMMENDATION.     ..... we recommend that His Majesty&apos;s Government shouldtake every step in their power to urge on the employers andoperatives in Lancashire the importance of considering thefollowing possible means /&quot;recommended in the Report/ of reducing&quot;the costs of &quot;product ion &quot;and recovering the lost export trade in cotton goods.     Immediate steps were taken by the Government to urge on theemployers and operatives the importance of giving a full and early consideration to the Report of the Committee.     The Home Secretary presented the Report to a meeting ofrepresentatives of the industry in Lancashire in July, 1930,and said that the Government hoped to receive the considered views on the Report of the various sections of the industry assoon as possible.    (See CP. 319(30)).     The Home Secretary returned to Manchester in October,accompanied by the President of the Board of Trade and metrepresentatives of the following sections of the industry onthe 22nd and 23rd of that month:-                      Spinners.                      Manufacturers.                      Finishers.                      Merchants.                      Operatives.     These meetings were taken up with preliminary statements bythe various sections of their views on the Cotton Report.     More detailed discussion with the various sections is now proceeding.     The Home Secretary and the President of the Board ofTrade went again to Manchester on the 20th November  to meetthe Spinners and arrangements are being made for the Ministers
9 o oto meet the representatives of the Manufacturers again assoon as the Manufacturers&apos; Central Committee has collectedthe views of its district associations on the question of reorganisation.  With the idea of assisting the manufacturers to give a full and careful consideration to these difficult problems before they meet Ministers again, the chief industrial Adviser has had, during November and December,discussions with each of the main groups of manufacturers, viz.the groups at Blackburn, Burnley, Preston, Accrington, Nelson,Colne, Darwen and Bolton.2o   For the manufacture of cheap standard lines,in which british goods have been so largely ousted from the easternMarkets, extensive use has been made of the short-stapledIndian cotton.  This has hitherto been but&quot; lit tie used inLancashire, where the 1onger--st apled but, more expensiveAmerican,cotton has been almost exclusively preferred,  In thisway her competitors, some of whom have, acquired great skill inthe mixing of Indian and other cottons with&quot;,American cotton;,have secured an initial advantage over Lancashire by using acheaper cotton for their manufactures.,                     &quot;     Representatives of the industry contend that short-stapled cotton has been used in Lancashire for many years pastwhenever its relative price has made such use profitable.They further state that this cotton is still being usedwhenever conditions demand it, and that in fact its use at thepresent time is growing.  In support of these statements theysubmitted the following figures showing Lancashire&apos;sconsumption of American and Indian cotton (in thousands ofbales)Year.American,Indian.19131920192119221923192419251926192?192819293,6673, 0741,6782,2751,9191, 6952,3442,0932,0771,9491,91042 48 31 43 86161146134 66 97146

According to the Board of Trade figures this progressin the use of Indian cotton has been maintained and increased during 1930 - notwithstanding the general depression which has had a marked effect on the use ofother kinds of cotton;  the figures are as follows:-Imports of	1928	1929	1930British Indian Cotton. American Cotton Egyptian Cotton	963,943 8,680,328 3,041,954	Centals of 100 IDS. 1,061,362 8,360,637 2,958,802	1,216,737 5,884,062 2,101,632     One of the representatives of the Spinners emphasizedto Ministers this importance of the Lancashire waste trade -the trade of practically the whole of the Rossendale Valley.He said that the higher classes of waste were cheaper and better than many growths of Indian cotton, that the yarnspun from it commanded better prices than yarn spun from indian cotton and that Lancashire leads the world in know-ledge of how to make use of waste - but is at some pains notto publish the fact to her competitors.     He went on tO&quot;&quot;eay the waste of the cotton spun in thiscountry last year amounted to 300,OuO balesa much of whichis a substitute for Indian cotton^-and In addition that therewas a considerable importation of waste from America, from
India, Japan and other countries - one firm alone havingimported 25,000 hales from America in one year.     It seems clear that waste spinning is of considerable importance:  of 185 mills combining spinning with weavingnearly 50 are primarily concerned with the spinning of yarnfrom waste, and the same is true of at least 20 of the millswhich confine themselves to spinning.   Moreover not onlyis the home produced waste made into yarn but also thereis a very steady importation of high quality cotton waste -the figures for 1928 to 1930 are as follows:-1 ;	Quant ity.		--  Imports - cwts.	1928	1929	1930	442,698	510,129	507,279     It will be seen that the imports of waste haveincreased over the past three years - a period which sawa substantial decline in the Imports of raw cotton, andthe obvious assumption Is that the waste spinning trade has escaped the depression prevailing among the other sections of the trade.     The Cotton Enquiry did not deal specifically withthe spinning of waste in their Report and naturally the spinners take the point that the criticism of the. industry for failing to make adequate use of the cheaper kinds ofcotton was unjustified If, as appeared to be the case,it failed to take account of the quantity of  waste spunin Lancashire, together with the increasing consumptionof short stapled  Indian cotton.
                                                             9 F?L                                                             AY J    3.     The use of such /Tndiany7 cotton might also require areadjustment of the balance between oardroom and spinningmachinery. &quot;&quot;    ..     The capacity of cardroom machinery to providecotton for a given number of spindles depends on the weightof the raw cotton to be handled.  The coarser the countsthe greater is the weight of the cotton required per spindle,and, consequently a change from American medium counts(36sto 44s) to coarse Indian counts (say 13s) destroys thebalance between the carding and spinning machinery:  in sucha case the position would be that either the carding machinerymust be doubled or one half the spindles must be allowedto stand idle.   This is a serious obstacle in the way of changes from medium to coarse counts:  not only is thecardroom machinery expensive, but also very few mills havethe available space for an extension of cardroom machinery.There is the further difficulty that even when money andspace are available only in isolated cases would there besufficient motive power to work the additional machinery.   4.  Other countries use ring spindles to a much greater extent than Lancashire and this method of spinning is ofesjgeoial importance where Indian and other short-stapledcotton is to be used.__High draft spinning machinery and high speed winding machinery have also been found to offer thepossibility of valuable economies.     The Spinners agree that the adoption of RingSpindles in place of Mule Spindles would undoubtedly effect a substantial economy in the cost of production and it it.stated that these technical improvements (including thecomplementary high drafting and&quot;also high speed winding) arebeing carried out wherever the capital cost can be justified- it is evident, however, that no important increase in thenumber of ring spindles is taking place.     The hpinners point out that ring spindles areextensively used in Lancashire, and, in fact, that wepossess in this country a larger number of ring spindles
than any other country with the exception of the U.S.A.The following figures showing the position as at 31st July1930, are baken from the International Cotton Bulletin:-                     Mule        Ring Spindles                   Spindles        Millions.

Lancashire cannot herself find the money for changes on a large scale, and it is obviously out of thequestion for the City to be asked in present circumstances to finance the individual unit.    Unless the reform of organisation and re-equipment go hand in hand money spent onre-equipment is very likely to be wasted.   This considerationalso applies to the  other question of re-equipment with &quot;regardto cardroom machinery in paragraph 3 and automatic looms inparagraph 5.    There is also the difficulty that these changes involvea considerable displacement of adult male labour and theemployers have stated that the Tirade Unions are reluctant toagree to action on any substantial scale.
      5*  In the manufacturing section the most important development abroad, has been the introduction of automatic and semir-automatic lopmsr f or the weaving of standard cloths. These do iiot,, &quot;as a niTe,&quot; give a greater output per loom, but each weaver&quot; can mind&quot;^&quot; very^ipuch^ larger number of looms than in the case of&apos;the&apos;ordinary power., loom as used in Lancashlre.__in this&apos;-way,  an important saving in wage costs is possjble concurrently with an improvement in the remuneration&quot;of&quot;the  individual weaver.      Some movement is going on in Lancashire in the direction of substituting automatic looms or equipping looms with automatic attachments, but here again there arises the difficulty of finding the considerable amount of capital necessary to make the changes - the automatic loom costing about  60 as compared with  30 for the ordinary loom and the automatic weft replenishing motion required to convert the ordinary to the eemi--automatic loom costing about  20.  Not- only, however, is there the difflicjjLlty-of -prcnrijiing-funds, but also the co-operation of the operatives must be secured, before automatic looms can be made to pay their way.  It is necessary in the first place that the weaver should mind a larger number of looms than has hitherto been the practice and in t he second  that double shifts  should be worked.  The second point is dealt with in paragraph 6 below.  With regard to  the first  point, there has been an agreement with the operatives involving  the withdrawal of the restriction which fixed 20 as  the number of  automatic looms te be worked by a weaver,  It is  said  that the ideal is that each weaver should work, say, 40 looms and  that this has already been achieved at one of the mills of  the Calico Printers&apos; Association.  The Lancashire Cotton Corporation&quot;has got near to the figure with 38&quot;and Messrs. Horrockses and Crewdson - whose  experiments have led &quot;to the withdrawal-of the restriction - are  running 30 wide looms per operative.      An experiment which  may have an  important bearing Upon the introduction of  automatic looms is proceeding  at the
Higher Walton Mill of the Lancashire Cotton Corporation wherea battery of 40 looms of each of three types of automaticlooms and a battery of 40 looms of each of three types of automatic attachments have been installed together witha battery of 40 Lancashire looms, and these 280 looms are tobe worked for an extended trial under exactly similar con-ditions.   The results of the experiment should be of greatmoment to Lancashire as a whole.  In present circumstances there is considerable doubt as to the best type of automaticloom and as to the relative merits of automatic looms andautomatic attachments;  until this doubt has been satisfactorily resolved, it would be unreasonable to expect any general movement towards re-equipment of this nature.When the matter has been settled it will be of the utmost importance to secure the further co-operation of the operatives.  As will be seen above and in paragraph 6 . the operatives are co-operating at the present time, but thedispute which is now in progress with regard to theapplication of the more-looms-to-a-weaver system indicates that very considerable difficulties may arise in regard tothe adoption of automatic looms on any considerable scale -which would, of course, involve a far greater displacementof labour.     6. The initial cost of automatic looms, and, to aless extent, of automatic attachments to ordinary looms,is high,  and we received important evidence that automaticlooms could not be worked economically on a single shiftper day.     Opinion in Lancashire is unfortunately still dividedon the question of double shifts.  A year or so a go aSub-Committee of the Joint Committee examined the questionwithout arriving at any definite conclusion, but the prosand cons were set out in the Sub-Committee&apos;s Report with a
                                                          Urecommendation that the possibilities deserved closerexamination by both operatives and manufacturers.    At the present time the manufacturers with one ortwo exceptions, agree that double shifts are required butthe operatives are in general opposed to the change on social grounds.  An important step has, however, now beentaken in that both sides have agreed&quot; to experimental workingof the two shift system at Accrington, where Highams Limitedhave just completed a new weaving shed in which there are about 220 automatic looms for use in manufacturing sheetingsand similar kinds of cloth.  It is proposed to work twoshifts, the first from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. and the second from  p.m,  to 10 p.m.  Male labour is being used and the menare to work 16 looms each.  The scheme has been approvedby the Local leavers&apos;  Association on the understanding thatthe operatives are paid a certain minimum wage.   It isunderstood that similar experiments are also being made atPreston (by the L.C.C.) and at Blackburn and Rochdale.     7.  The formation of larger units in the spinning and manufacturing sections of the industry would serve three great purposes:  (a) they would permit full advantage to betaken of any possibilitiesiof technical improvements andwould secure economies in production costs;  (b) they wouldenable a common policy to be formulated and carried intoeffect within each of these sections:  Tel  they would providea firm basis for such a measure of co-ordination between those engaged in the various processes of production and marketing as will enable Lancashire once&quot; more to take theinitiative in the markets of the world&quot;.  These units shouldbe strong enough to formulate&apos;a definite production policyand to enter into arrangements with one another and with theothe^ sections of the industry, including the merchants and&quot;&quot;the&quot;fjnishers. for a forward policy^     (a) The Spinning section has been most hardly hit andhas been, for this reason, the first to recognise thenecessity of reorganisation.  In the Egyptian SpinningSection there are already in existence a number of largecombines, (Pine Cotton Spinners, Amalgamated Cotton Mills
Trust, Combined Egyptian Hills, Joshua Hoyle &amp; Sons, Ltd.,and Crosses C- VJinkworths), while in the American Section the recently constituted Lancashire Cotton Corporation is treadingthe path of amalgamation.  In the same section of thetrade considerable progress has been made towards the forma-tion of another combine - Allied Spinners, Ltd.  of thesecombines the only ones that could be said to have been successful in the pa,at has been the Pine Cotton Spinners,and in a less degree, Joshua Hoyles - and both these companies are beginning to feel the pinch.  Other combinesin the Egyptian section have been mere or less failures,although their non-success may to some extent have been dueto over-capitalisation.  A statement showing the tradingrecords of some of these combines is given in Knnexe I.The main difficulty  in connexion with over-capitalisationhas arisen where a large proportion of the capital  is  in  theform  of debentures or loans on which the company is boundto pay interest whether  profits are made or not.  It willbe seen, for example, from Annexe I that the  interest  charges of the Amalgamated Cotton Hills Trust  exceeded  the  tradingprofit in  1939, and  converted  a relatively small loss  in  19&quot;0into  a large loss;   it is  to  this fact that the  difficultiesof the Combine  are  largely  due.  Again a  comparison of thePine  Cotton  Spinners and Combined Egyptian Mills shows thatthe  interest charges to  be  paid by  the latter,   599,000 arenearly  three times greater than in the  case  of the former 110,000  - notwithstanding that  the  combines  have roughlythe  same  capital.   The  combines  are  about  the same  size (over 3m.  spindles)  but  Combined Egyptian Mills have tomake at  least   189,000  more profit  a year than the  FineCotton Spinners before  it can reach the  level of the latter combine from the  point  of view of  earning capacity  in the eyes of the  investing public.  In  years  in which the interest exceeds  the profits  the balance  accumulates to
                                                        9 o 7form a growing burden on the overcapitalized  concern whlcn-may ultimately lead  to  its extinction.     It  cannot be  assumed however  that the burden ofinterest charges is  the only reason for  the non-success ofthese combines:  other  important factors may be  that  theinternal organisation of the combine  is  not such as tosecure  the  full  benefits of  the  large scale operations opento a combine  or  that the controlling  personnel Is not of highenough  calibre  - it  has been suggested  that one  or  other or both of  these factors  are  operating in  the case  of  certaincombines.     The Lancashire  Cotton Corporation  has yet  to prove itself  and Lancashire  in  a very sceptical  spirit is still awaiting the  issue of  the  Corporation&apos;s balance  sheet.  The Corporation has taken over a number of  very badly placed mills,  some of  which will  net  be re-started,  and for this  and other reasons (e.g.  the depressed sta-te of trade since  the Corporation was started)  it is not likely that good  results can yet be shown.   At the same time,  it is understood that the corr^oration has  succeeded in realising a number of definite advantages resulting from large-scale- operation and as  soon as this can be made clear there should be a considerable impetus to the movement in Lancashire. In the  meantime the representatives  of the industry do not fail to point out that during the present depression even the Fine Cotton  Spinners are being hit and  that in fact  there are a considerable number  of individual  concerns which are -weathering the storm more successfully  than the big  combines.      (b) In  the manufacturing section,  which has not as yet suffered as  severely as the spinning section -  partly no doubt because the weavers were in  the main not guilty of over-capitalisation during  the boom  period - the feeling  in regard  to  amalgp^natlon is by no means favourable.  At the same time  there are, in effect, a number  of combines already in existence -  or perhaps  they  might better be  described  as working arrangements between  interlocked  Companies.  A
                                                          CJ  Cjdiagram showing the lagout of one of these groups, the&quot;Kelson&quot; group, is given in Annexe III,  The groupillustrates the  complexity of combination In the fancysection of the trade:  as will be seen It embraces spinningand weaving, combines the mai?ufacture of artificial silkwith that of cotton, and Is linked with a number ofmerchanting concerns.  The difficulty in the weaving sectionof securing adherence to the principle of amalgamation arises from the very diverse nature of the trade.  The weaversinsist that their trade is highly specialised and demandsthe relatively small unit with the personal attention of theproprietor.  Moreover, since the weaving section is much less frn&amp;ncially embarrassed than the spinning section, itseems unlikely that  terms based on the Lancashire CottonCorporation scheme cf amalgamation - the only terms whichhave been publicly offered in Lancashire as yet - would be acceptable to the weavers.   There is, however, under  con-sideration in the City at the present  time  an amalgamationscheme  covering an important section of  the manufacturingside of  the industry which provides rather  different  terms  -terms more  likely to be  acceptable by  solvent concerns,  ifthis scheme is successfully  launched,  the attitude  of theweavers  will no doubt be  considerably  modified.   Conversa-tions are being held with the  representatives of  the  manu-facturers from the  different districts and  their  views  arebeing  ascertained on the point  whether the  present  layout oftheir  industry is  the best  under existing conditions  of world  trading.  The  different bodies  are at the  moment sittingdown thoroughly  to explore  the  position, and Ministers  willbe meeting the whole body of manufacturers  at  an early date.    8.   Finishers.        The Cotton Enquiry pointed out  that  combinationhas already taken place to a considerable extent in the
finishing trades.   The three main sections are as follows:-   Bleaching.  The Bleaching Trade Advisory Board, an    organisation  for fixing bleaching charges, includes    nearly all the bleachers, the largest combine in this    organisation, covering 70^ of the tra.de, being the    Bleachers&apos; Association Ltd.   Printing.  The members of the Federation of Calico    Printers are responsible for about 85$ of the total    output of calico prints, and the Calico printers    Association represent about SOp of the productive power    of the Federation.   Dyeing. The Piece Dyers Association represents a    majority both in number of firms and volume of output    of the piece dyeing trade.  The largest unit  in the    Association is the Bradford Dyers Association.     A movement is on foot to extend still further thearea of combination in the throe sections  of the  finishingtrade, and an attempt has been made to round off  thecalico printing combine by bringing in the printingbusinesses which have hitherto remained  outside the combine.This attempt has not succeeded up to the present  but  as nearly one  third of the total number of  finishing plants,500, and  nearly two thirds of the total  finishing output isunder the control of the  large units, further  combinationcannot be regarded as  a matter of any urgency..    9.........the formation  of strong and  well-balanced&apos; amalgamations among the merchants also&quot; deserves  careTulconsideration.     Lancashire  certainly possesses in the Manchestermerchanting system  the finest  selling organisation  of itskind in  the  whole world.   Through its merchants Manchesterhas its  finger  on the  pulse  of every market;   many  merchants
                                                      w ware in receipt almost hourly of Information from the markets with which they trade.     The attitude of the merchants towards amalgamationIs largely influenced by the fact that they are to a veryconsiderable extent in an independent position:  themerchant can fairly  readily realise his capital and as heno longer does any particular amount of consignment business in the overseas markets, he is in the happy position ofsimply waiting until the orders come along.     The great weakness of the cotton Indus try is the lack of a community of interest between the merchants andthe producers:  the merchants are not interested to providethe producers with the long runs essential to economicalworking, nor can  they be expected in slack times to order for stock to keep someone else&apos;s looms at work, or to sellunprofitable lines to maintain or create  a market.Amalgamation among merchants  would  afford no real re-^dyfor difficulties  of  this sort.     Amalgamation among  the merchants might yieldsome benefit from the  point of view of efficiency *-f  dis-tribution,  saving of  duplication  of effort etc., but  usthere  are already large  end highly  efficient concernsspecialising  in particular  markets, such amalgamations maynot be a matter of  great urgency.   As  examination  of  these problems  proceeds it  emerges  more  and. more  clearl^  that the vital requirement is to link the larger  merchanting concerns  in some way or other .with the producers,  and tentative plans to  this end are  being discussed.   It  seems clear  however that  the initiative in such co-operation will have  to come  from the merchants  who, by training and experience, appear far more able than the manufacturers  to provide leaders to handle  large industrial enterprises.
    Use of Joint Committee for development of Co-operative effort.     10.  Valuable, service, is being rendered - to the cottonll^strvMby-^e^Joint .Co&quot;nixaittee&quot;&quot;of Cotton&quot; Trade&quot; Organisations.The experiments that are/being set on fpqt^under the.auspices of the Committee in co-operative production&apos;&quot;and&apos; systematicparivetinp; of standard&quot; lines of&quot;&quot;poods should provide&quot; a practicaltesting ground of  the possibilities of solving what we regard as the central problem of the.,industry.   &quot;aore generally, theCommittee can do valuable&apos; . work&quot;in various directions,, ingooupmi.P..inves11 gation and its co-ordination with technicalresearch and in the&quot;praotical application of both,&quot;in the interchange of ideas a&apos;nd&quot;&quot;informatio*n^between tho various&quot;sections of the industry, in organised propaganda and the&apos;finding of new uses for cotton._The Joint.Committee affordsan opportunity for &quot;the development &quot;of &quot;a&quot;centre, of information and study, a&quot;&quot;commpn mind, a concerted policy,, fpr7theIndustry as a whole.     One of the encouraging features of  1930, so far as thecotton trade is concerned, was the emergence of a strongersense of unity, ana the wider recognition of the need for acommon outlook and a concerted policy.   This was demonstrated,as early as last February.   when speaking&apos;  on behalf of all sections of the cotton  industry,  the Joint  Committee declaredits sympathy with  the movement towards larger units and from thattime onward has taken a  keen interest  in the progress of amalgamation.     Two interesting features  of  the Joint  Committee&apos;s workwhich were in hand before the  appearance of the Cotton report are worthy of notice.     The first was the  experiment mentioned by the  CottonEnquiry  (see above).    In ilarch,  the Committee arranged  forthe  registration of  the British Cotton Textile Association,a body  representative  of the different sections of  thetrade,  including operatives, whose  functions are  to superviseand  assist co-operative efforts  in  the production and marketing  of  certain standard  goods,  the trade  in which  hasbeen almost wholly lost to  this  country.   It had been ascertained by lengthy inquiries  during  the previous two years
that British competition in these standard lines was rendered difficult by the existence of so many individualconcerns in every stage of the industry.   In order to induceeach section to  grant whatever concession in practice or reduction of charge might he necessary to secure business,  itwas felt desirable that there should be an authoritative body,on whose recommendations such concessions or reductions wouldbe made to the promoters of any enterprise which was sincerelydesigned to recover lost trade, and not merely to secureindividual profit.   The rapid decline in values which hastaKen place during the last six months has held back thevarious interests concerned from actually commencing operations,but there is now some prospect of an early start as it is not thought liicely that prices will decline much more.   As willbe seen, the Cotton Inquiry Report gave warm approval to this method of tackling foreign competition on co-operative lines,and the Government, through the Department of Overseas trade,has undertaken to assist by offering to bear part of the costof market investigations necessary as a preliminary to the attempt to  regain trade  in standard lines.     The second  event  in importance was probably theformation by  the Joint Committee of a Trade development committee to  investigate the  possibilities of increasingand extending the demand for  cotton goods.   This Committeehas a  very  strong membership  and includes technical and economic  experts and  publicists. ,&apos;  It has already donepioneer work  on  the use  of Indian cotton  for certain  types&apos; of  cloth  which had  previously been made from American cotton in Lancashire.   It has  also  drawn up a far reaching  scheme of intelligence  work  and propaganda for the cotton  trade, which will shortly be submitted to the  trade for approval. The basis of the scheme  is  that there  should be more  adequate provision of information from within  the  trade  and  from  the                             -26-
                                                         ** ft 3  . Amarkets, and that the Lancashire cotton industry should under-take direct propaganda to retain its trade both at  home andabroad.   The first step in the direction of organisedpropaganda is represented by the British Cotton TextileExhibition, which is to be held at the White City in London,next month.   About 100 firms and trade associations havealready decided to take part in this Exhibition, which has aroused considerable interest among buyers in this  countryand overseas.     In July, shortly after the publication of the  CottonInquiry Reoort, the Joint Committee discussed those sections                                                                iof it which referred to the need for more adequatestatistical and other information, the desirability of more                                                              -  Ieffective co-operation between the various sections, and thevalue of organised propaganda.   It was agreed that these                                                                jsubjects lay within the province of the Joint Committee, and could best be dealt with by the collaboration of all sections.     Towards the end of September, the Joint Committeemet again to consider what further development was possible  inthe direction of a more united policy.   For the first time  theJoint Committee claimed the right, as a body representative  ofthe whole trade, to be informed of any sectional action  whoseconsequences might affect other sections or the trade in                                                                jigeneral.   This claim was endorsed by every section, in  terms which  suggested that there was a unanimous desire for joint                                                                discussion of problems, even though some of them were likely                                                                j&apos;to be highly controversial.                                     j     The constitution of the Joint Committee has been amended in order to strengthen its representative character,and to facilitate the inclusion of prominent individuals,whose  experience and knowledge might assist its discussions.In pursuance of this policy the Liverpool and Manchester Cotton jAssociations were invited to nominate representatives on the     j                            -27-
$ p $oJ u iiCommittee, which now embraces every stage in the handling ofcotton, from raw material to packing and export.     During the year, the Cotton Ira.de Statistical Bureauhas been busily employed, both as tho Exocutive of theJoint Committee, and in providing information for the tra.de.Its Bulletins are now on a regular monthly basis, and enjoya wide circulation in the industry.   Efforts are beingmade to Improve and extend the sources of statistical information, in this and other countries, with a view to giving the trade the most reliable  indications possible,in regard to current trends.     Further, the Joint Committee and the Bureau have beendoing useful work in supplying data and  in  affordingopportunities for discussion, of the internal structure  ofthe  industry, as a means of  helping forward the movement towards larger  and stronger  units.    Their services to  theGovernment  in this matter  have been particularly valuable;at a considerable expenditure of labour  and money  they have prepared  for our use,  a  complete survey  of  the  units  inthe  ootton  industry  together with  a map  on  a large scaleshowing very clearly the  lay-out of the  industry.   11. Tho  changed conditions abroad, particularly in theFar  East, have  vitally affected  the position at  home-.  Webe I ievlTtnat&quot; advantage might accrue&apos;from an examination  ofthese -conditions  on  the  spot by  the representatives of &quot;tEeBritish  industry.    In the evemTof&quot;tHe&quot;^naustry deoiSing tosend out  a  mxssion or missions  for this  purpose,  we recommendtTaatHBIs &quot;Hafes&quot;ty * s &quot;&amp;&quot;oyernment  should do  all in  their^powert&apos;o &quot;facilitate  and assist  their  work.      Shortly after the publication of  the Report arrangements were made by the  Government for a  strong Economic Mission representing  the  textile and other industries to visit  theFar East;  a  special cotton Mission, composed of representatives of cotton operatives and industrialists  is  attached to  the  mainmission.     The Sub-Mission&apos;s  terms of  reference require it to assist the  Economic  Mission in their enquiries  so far as these                           -28-
relate to cotton goods, and to report  what  action  should betaken to develop and increase British  trade in these  goods.     Further it has recently been decided to send  a mission to Egypt on which the cotton industry  will be represented  byone of its leading and most successful people - Mr.Kenneth Lethe head of the footal Broadhurst Lee  Company..     There are also proposals under consideration for theappointment of cotton trade experts to represent theindustry in various markets of the world - the Governmentand the industry sharing the cost.

It is impossible to arrive at any satisfactoryestimate of the capital position of this combine for thereason that all the mills appear in the balance sheets at their original oost of  7,956,000, notwithstanding that a drasticwriting down of absurdly high boom figures is long overdue.In the case of one of the units in the combine, Horrockses,Orewdson&amp; Co., Ltd., a sum of  1,  95,000 has in fact been written off - but the concern still stands in the balancesheets of the combine of the original figure.     The trading results of the subsidiary companies show considerable gross trading profits which are, however, seriouslyreduced or converted into losses by the heavy charges fordebenture interest which no doubt are due primarily to the over-capitalisation.

Combined Egyptian Mills.     The accounts for the period of 17 months from theformation of this combine of fine-spinning companies,  whichcontrols some 3,100,000 spindles in all,  are discouraging.   Ithas, of course, to be remembered that from its inception thecombine has had to contend with falling cotton and yarnprices.   After writing down of stocks (including lossesamounting to  171,712) the trading results showed a loss of 130,759, and this loss is further enhanced by other charges the main item of which is  299,333 for general interest and bankers charges.  In the result the operations of the combine during its first period of trading show a debitbalance of  492,173.
