SUGAR  BEET  SUBSIDY.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture jand FIoh.er5.esaS^^Office.^^.JBg^:-special Assistance for 1951^2 Campaign.,  In accordance with Conclusion 4 of the Cabinet on 20th  January,  (Cab.  10 (31) the Ghanoellor of the Exchequer, the  President of the Board cf Trade and I have considered  further the proposition for alleviating the position of the  beet sugar industry,  and have met representatives of the  beet pugar factories.              &quot;We consider that the principles   that should govern any additional assistance   which may he made available are  as  follows:-  &quot;  (i) All parties, i,e.  the factories,  the farmers and the      State to make some saorifioe. (il) The larger factories to reoeive proportionately less      assistance than the smaller.(iii) Although the Government should avoid taking any responsi-      bility for a definite figure the assistance should be      such as will enable most faotories to offer farmers 43/6d,      per ton of beet (17^$ sugar)  as compared with the      farmers1 demand of 46/0d. (iv) The prioe offered to farmers should be suoh as to      require from the majority of faotories a maximum      sacrifice of provision for depreciation and other      capital charger,  profit and additions to reserves,  (v) The assistance should be recoverable from the factories      during the last two years of the Subsidy Aot, according      to the factories11 oapacity to repay judged In relation      to sugar prices,
3.    The amount of the assistance should be limited          now      to an extra subsidy of l/3d. per cwt.  of sugar,  payable      only in respect of the first 300,000 cwts.  of      sugar (ex. 98Q polarisation) manufactured in each factory      in 1931-2.           The maximum benefit from this method will accrue      to the 11 smaller factories ** with an aggregate output not      expected to exceed 3 million cwts.           The remaining^7 larger factories ^ould benefit      only in respect of the first 300,000 cwts.  of sugar      manufactured in each factory, the balance of their output      receiving subsidy only at the normal rate.4.    The maximum sum for which the Exchequer would be liable      would be  318,750.   This amount is about  56,000 less      than the sum which would be payable were a flat rate of      l/3d. per cwt. of sugar applied to the estimated total      output of all  the factories.5.    This proposal  represents, moreover, a saving of  276,000,      upon the original proposal  for an  extra subsidy of 2/      per cwt., which, however, allowed  the factories to make      a  limited provision for depreciotion  or debenture interest.6.    we suggest that the following conditions of the      assistance should be laid down:-      (i) All beet contracts offered by  farmers to be accepted      by factories up to their bhroushput capacity.           This is to ensure that no factory shall limit      its contracts  for beet to the amount  in respect of which it      would secure the  extra sugar ,subsidy.      (13-) The extra assistance to be contingent upon the      price of sugar during the 1951/2 manufacturing campaign,      that is to say, if the price of sugar rises above the      price (i.e, 7/- per cwt, -  ex, duty) which is the basis       * One of these factories has only  a small throughput of         sugar beet.
    on which the present discussions haye been    conducted,  the amount of extra assistance    shall be abated by the amount of the rise    in sugar prices.          The precise method of application of    this condition requires further examination    in consultation with the industry.    (iii) The cost of the extra subsidy to be    recoverable from the factories during the    last two years of operation of the present    Subsidy Act.          ine extra subsidy in effect guarantees    to factories a price of 8/3d. per cwt. ex.    duty.   Trie factories are  to be entitled in    the last two years to make, if they can,    limited provision for depreciation or    debenture interest before  incurring liability    for repayment.          Assuming that  lid. per owt. of  sugar or    thereabouts is a limited average provision    for  this purpose, the Government snould  recover    the  extra subsidy from  the several factories    when and only  to the extent that the  price of    sugar exceeds  9/2d.  per owt.   The repayment    would be secured by  deduction from the normal    subsidy payable under the  existing Aot.&apos;.   I accordingly  submit the abovejproxsosals for    the  approval  of my  colleagues  and ask for    their authority to  announce  them to  the  industrial    as being the  maximum assistance  that  the     fovorntnsnt  is  prepared  to  offer.                                    (Intld.)   C.A.ministry  of Agriculture  and                     Fisheries.     3rd February, 1931
