This Circular was re-issued by our predecessorswhen they took Office in the Autumn of 1924.  The regulationswere in substance approved at our first Cabinet Meetings in1929, and I now suggest that the Circular should be  againissued to all Departments, and that the opportunity  shouldbe taken of emphasising the importance of securing that alldraft Bills arc fully examined by the Departments concernedbefore they are circulated to the Committee of Home  Affairs.and recommend the Cabinet to approve its issue  forthwith toall Departments.The regulations regarding the submission ofI attach a draft of the proposed Treasury Circiilar(Intd.)

SUBMISSION  OF  BUSINESS  TO  THE  CABINET.               CABINET DECISION  AS  TO PROCEDURE.Sm,      I AM directed by the Lords  Commissioners  of  His  Majesty&apos;s Treasury to acquaint you, for the information ofthat His  Majesty&apos;s  Government have recently had under  consideration thearrangements regarding the submission of business to the Cabinet, and in particularhave had before them the Circular No. 11/24 of the 28th April, 1924, on this subject,the main provisions of which were approved by the Cabinet at their Meetings onthe 10th and 21st of June, 1929.    A  copy of that Circular is  printed hereunder, and I am to state that HisMajesty&apos;s  Government have reaffirmed their decision  that the procedure thereinindicated shall continue  to be observed in  its entirety.    In this connection  I  am to emphasise  the  importance of securing that alldraft Bills are fully examined  by  the  Departments  concerned  before they are circulated to the Committee of Home Affairs.  A Department originating legisla-tion should, in any case, arrange  for  the circulation to that Committee of the draftBill as  long in advance as possible,  and in every case  the covering memorandum to the  Bill should, in accordance with the requirements of the Circular, contain a specific  statement that the draft  Bill has  been examined by all departments which are, or may be,  affected by its provisions.                               I am, Sir,                                     Your obedient Servant,                                               N. F. WARREN FISHER.G. 3647.
No. 11/24.COPY OF TREASURY  CIRCULAR,  28TH APRIL, 1924.SIB,       I AM directed by the Lords Commissioners of H.M.  Treasury to acquaintyou, for the information ofthat H. M. Government have had under careful consideration the question ofinsuring that  the Cabinet and  Cabinet Committees shall be invited to  reach decisions only after the subject referred to the Cabinet has been thoroughly examinedbetween each  of the various Public Departments concerned.    This elementary rule of business is essential if the Cabinet and its committees are to  have available all the facts and points of view requisite for an enlighteneddecision and are to be saved the possibility of hasty or  uninformed conclusions.    The  observance of the rule is the more obligatory under  modern conditionswhen the mass  of Government business  has so enormously increased, and as  a consequence Governments can only get through it efficiently if the issues presented for decision have been carefully investigated beforehand  by the Departments in collaboration.    The  Cabinet feels sure that Departments are anxious to assist it in securingthe observance of this rule, and has come to the conclusion that the desired objectwill be facilitated by  the  following procedure.   In  future  all  memoranda, draftBills and other constituents of the Agenda will be sent  to the Cabinet Secretariatfor circulation only after their subject-matter  has been fully  examined betweenthe Departments from which they emanate, the Treasury, the Law Officers wherecontentious Bills are  involved, and any other  Department concerned,  and these documents will bear on the face of them a specific statement that this examinationhas taken  place.  The documents should be made as complete as possible bycontaining the various arguments and criticisms which  might be brought againstthe proposals  advocated.  To enable the members  of  the  Cabinet  (and cabinet committees)  to  have  time to consider  proposals intended for Cabinet decision and in view also of the possibility that such inter-Departmental examination may result in definite differences of opinion necessitating the  preparation of memoranda by the dissenting Department or Departments, no memoranda, draft Bills, etc.,which originate proposals for Cabinet decision will be placed on the Agenda until an interval of at least  five days has elapsed  after circulation,  except on any occasion when the Prime Minister expressly authorises  a relaxation of the rule.                                I am, Sir,                                      Your obedient  Servant,                                               N. F. WARREN FISHER.9378 -32) Wt. 27184-1108 80 2/31 P. St. G.354
