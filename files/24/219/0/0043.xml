SHORTAGE  OF  OFFICERS  AND NURSES IN  THE  MEDICAL,DENTAL  AND  NURSING SERVICES OF  THE ROYAL  NAVY,             THE  ARMY  AND  THE  ROYAL AIR  FORCE.aumn til Ly *  JOINT MEMORANDUM BY THE FIEST LORD  OF THE ADMIRALTY,  THE SECRETARY  OE             STATE EOR WAR AND  THE SECRETARY OE STATE EOR AIR.                   (Former papers CP. 367 (25) and 206 (26).)     The three Defence  Services have for  years past experienced great difficulty  in recruiting officers and nurses for their respective Medical and  Nursing Services, and the  Mquestion was under active consideration in 1925, with the result that at a meeting held on 7th  August, 1925, following a discussion on the Pay of the Fighting  Services, theCabinet agreed (Cabinet  44 (25), Conclusion 9) that, in view of  the  importance of anearly settlement of the  pay  of Royal Army Medieal  Corps  officers and  nurses, an interdepartmental  Committee should be set up to examine forthwith the  pay of officersand  nurses  of the  Medical Services  or the  Navy, Army and Air Force, and  all mattersancillary thereto, the Committee to  have authority  to  take evidence  from outside theGovernment Service and to receive any assistance it might  require  from medical officersin the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Pensions.   The Committee was  constitutedas follows :               Sir Warren Fisher, G.C.B., Chairman.              Mr. H. E.  Fass, O.B.E.         ) ,,,              Dr. H.  Gr. Turney, O.B.E., M.D. ( 1 r8asu]7-              Surgeon Vice-Admiral Sir Joseph Chambers,                  K.C.B.. C.M.G., K.H.P., F.R.C.P.I.              Sir Charles Walker, K.C.B.

Longhurst, C.B., Cabinet Offices, and Mr. D. B.  Woodburn, Treasury,  asSecretaries.     With the approval of the Prime Minister, Mr. L. G. Brock, C.B., Ministry of Health(Chairman of the Committee  of Imperial Defence  Man-Power Medical Sub-Committee),was added to the Committee as originally  constituted, and  at the meetings  at whichquestions connected  with the  Nursing Services were discussed  the Committee hadthe  advantage of  the assistance of  the  Hon.  Maude  LawreDce,  Director  of WomenEstablishments of the Treasury.     It will be seen from the attached reports from  the three Heads of the medical services that in spite of  the adoption of the  recommendations  of the Fisher Committee,paragraphs  224 et seg of CP. 206 (26), the position is still serious.     The Ministers responsible for the  three  Service  Departments  ask the  Cabinet,therefore, to authorise the appointment of a  similar  Committee, preferably again underthe  presidency of Sir Warren Fisher, to consider the present position and to put forwardsuggestions for its amelioration.

THE CABINET.
APPENDIX A.            REPORT  BY  THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF  THE NAVY.    1. The establishment of Naval medical officers is 402.    2. This establishment is too small.    3. The actual number of medical officers on the list is 350.    4. This very serious shortage is striking at the very heart of efficiency.   Courses are practicallyat a standstill, appointments have to be made without any consideration for the exact selection of themost suitable officer, legitimate leave has often to be curtailed, frequent changes of officers at short notice are occurring, and the seeds are being thus sown for spreading discontent and inefficiencyamongst one of the hitherto most efficient, zealous and loyal branches of the Navy.    5.. As far back  as  15th  March,  1930, the  Medical Director-General of  the Navy prepared a full report showing that every effort that could possibly have been made,  had  been  made by him to remedy this shortage.    6. The shortage became so acute that at last candidates below the standard were entered.    7. The reports concerning these officers leave no doubt that this was a regrettable action.    8. To maintain Naval efficiency  and true economy, the medical officers must  be  of a high standard.    9. The Naval  rating cannot select  his doctor.  The Navy undertakes  to supply free medicalattention to all  serving  officers  and men.  This undertaking is not an honourable one if this medicalattention is insufficient and inferior.    10. The law of supply and demand proves that &quot; market rates &quot; are not being offered.    11. Drastic improvements in pay, pension and prospects are required immediately.APPENDIX  B.           REPORT BY THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL, ARMY MEDICAL SERVICES.                       Present position  of the Royal Army Medical Corps.     1. The shortage of medical officers  of the Army is causing grave anxiety.  Not only has the strength of regular officers fallen  below that required to form the necessary nucleus for the medical units of the  Expeditionary Force,  but  great  difficulty is  being  experienced in carrying on the ordinary routine medical work  of the Army in peace.     2. The lack of  candidates has  existed  ever since  the war.  It became  acute  in 1925.  The position became slightly better for the next 3 years, but in 1930 the supply has fallen to  the  level of  1925, and  it has now practically stopped.  Only two candidates have applied for the entry in January, 1931.     3. The present  shortage of  officers  is 173 out  of  a total  establishment  of  868,  and a home establishment of 457.  The  whole shortage falls on the home  establishment,  as that abroad  must be  kept up to strength.  In 6 years (1925-30) the total number of  entrants has been 114, whereas the retirements and deaths have been 273.     The normal yearly entry to maintain the normal establishment  is in tho  neighbourhood of 50.     4. Since the war the medical services for the  Army have  been carried  out  with the help of temporary officers, civilian practitioners  and re-employed  retired officers under the most adverse conditions.  This assistance is now almost impossible to obtain  and  great difficulty in providing for the ordinary routine duties is being experienced.     Moves of  officers from one station to  another are  causing exteme  financial and domestic  hardship and the situation is rapidly becoming intolerable.     Officers are breaking down  under the strain, and  during the past  5 years the death-rate  from disease of  serving officers has been approximately  50 per cent, higher than that  of  officers in therest of the  Army.     5. The effect of the present shortage on the amount of foreign service an officer is called upon to do  is intolerable.  Next trooping season  officers will be ordered abroad who  have served  less than2 years since their last foreign tour, i.e., the proportion will be 5 years abroad to 2 years at home.     This will  be certainly followed by a large number of retirements, more especially among the bestqualified officers who can most easily find employment in civil life.     6. Should  this be allowed to occur, the  medical  services will fall into disrepute, and the army will be without a medical service either in peace or war.  -   This will  happen within 2 years if the present shortage continues, as officers cannot be made toserve continuously abroad.     7. It is therefore of vital importance that steps be taken without  delay to obtain a supply of candidates from the medical schools.                                          .
                                          Conclusions.    9. (a) There is really no answer to the  first three of the reasons mentioned above, except that  afull establishment and reasonable conditions of service within  the corps would break the viciouscircle, and cause contentment and efficiency.  This would of itself obtain candidates.    (&amp;) The fourth reason is the crux of the whole question and presents the only available means of&quot;breaking the vicious circle.    Financial  inducements must be provided to overcome the other objections.    In 1926 the Warren  Fisher  Committee&apos;s recommendations raised  the pay to approximately themarket rate of the young doctor  in  civil life, with the result that tho supply of candidates increasedconsiderably for the next 2 or 3 years, but since then the periodic reductions that have taken placehave reduced the pay approximately to  the level that existed prior to the Warren Fisher Committee.The result has been that  the supply of candidates has proportionately fallen off.   In addition, the ratesof pay of the Colonial Medical Service have been since the war  at a much higher level than those ofthe Royal Army Medical Corps with the result that young doctors wishing to go abroad  have enteredthat  service in  increasing numbers, and  it has been able to obtain all the medical officers it  hasrequired.       REPORT BY THE  DIRECTOR OF MEDICAL SERVICES,  ROYAL AIR FORCE.    1. The  lack of suitable candidates for commissions in the medical branch  and the consequent-shortage of  officers have  now created a very serious position.    2. In 1926 a Cabinet enquiry was instituted into the shortage and its causes,  and as  a result thecommittee which conducted the investigations, the Warren Fisher Committee, recommended  certainimprovements in the conditions of service  calculated  to increase its attractiveness as a career.  these were  brought into effect but have  failed in their purpose, that is, to attract suitable candidates, or indeed at the present time any sort of candidate, in sufficient  numbers.    3. The  following table shows the number of enquiries received since 1924 and the results : -1. Year.	2. Number of enquiries.	3. Number of application forms received.	4. Number of applications withdrawn, and candidates failing to appear for interview.	5. Number of candidates considered unsuitable by Selection Board.	6. Number of candidates r- jected on medical grounds, as over age or for other reaoons not under Column 5.	&apos;7. Number of short service commissions granted out of Column 2.1924 ...... 1925 ...... 1926 ...... 1927 ...... 1928 ...... 1929 ...... 1930 ......

(i) General mistrust of Army service as a career, common to the whole Army and incidental-to post-war conditions.  It has now become ingrained owing to anti-war and disarmament propagandaof recent years.     (ii)  General belief in civil hospitals, medical schools, &amp;c, that  professional work in the Army isof a restricted character and overshadowed by work of a military kind.     (iii) The conditions under which Royal Army Medical Corps officers are at present serving owingto deficiency in numbers a vicious circle.     (iv) The pay offered is considerably less than  the market rate  of the young doctor and cannot be compared Avith that derived from a civil practice or the Colonial Medical  Service,  and moreoverArmy pay is subject to periodical reduction.
    4. Of those given short service commissions a certain number were only just  above the borderline dividing the suitable from the  unsuitable and  would never have been seriously considered ifa sufficient  supply of the right type of young doctor had been forthcoming.   It is also necessaryto record, regretfully, that a few have  been found  definitely undesirable after  acceptance and  havehad their commissions terminated.    5. The  following table  shows  the total establishment  and  the  strength  of officers  holdingpermanent and short service commissions since 1924.  The position improved in 1928 but fell off in1929 and has deteriorated further during the present year : Year.	Establishment.	Strength.	Deficit. -September ^ 1924 ... 1925 ... 1926 ... 1927 ... 1928 ... 1929 ... 1930 ... February, 1931 ...	212 220 213 206 198 202 208 208	142 150 160 165 179 175 171 163	70 ro 53 41 19 27 37 45    6. Everything in the way of advertisement of the Service and  its merits &quot;and attractions that can reasonably be expected has been done.  It is periodically advertised in the medical journals, lectureshave been arranged and delivered by senior officers to students at medical schools, efforts have beenmade by letter and interview to enlist the help of school authorities and, lastly, a considerable amountof time  has  been spent by officers visiting their old hospitals  and by  officers on study leave ininformally discussing the  Service with students and newly qualified men and trying to arouse their interest in it.    In spite of all efforts, however, the fact remains that numbers show a steady falling off.    7. From the numerous enquiries that have  been made  the  reasons for the failure to securecandidates appear to  be as follows :     (i)  The rates of pay are not sufficiently attractive.  Rightly or wrongly men think they can do          better in  civil  life. It is no longer necessary now for a young man to have private means-          to enable  him to buy a share in a practice.  Societies exist which are prepared to  advance          the necessary money, to be repaid out of the earnings of the practice.    (ii)  Tho detachable and  uetuatisg  20 per  cent, is frequently  severely criticised by applicants.          They feel the uncertainty of not knowing what the actual rate of pay may be at any time          in the future, and fear that any fluctuation will probably  be in a downward direction.   (iii)  A considerable proportion of applicants are engaged to be married, and wish to settle down as-          soon as they can make sure of a reasonable income.  The pay of a junior officer with no          allowances other than those to which  he is  entitled as a single  officer &quot; living out&quot; is          insufficient for a married  man.                     ...   (iv)  There also seems to be a psychological aspect.  Before the Avar there were many young          doctors who, without enquiring very closely into financial prospects, were attracted to the          Services by what  they  offered of adventure, sport and travel.   Possibly because of a          reaction caused  by  the war, the spirit answering to these attractions seems largely to have          disappeared.    8. It must be borne in mind that the  problem of the Medical Branch of the Royal Air Forcediffers in one most important respect from that  of the Royal Army Medical Corps in that all officers are recruited in the first instance on a short  service basis for three to  five years service and allvacancies for permanent commissions are filled by selection from among the  short service  officers sorecruited.  The number of these permanent commissions is regulated so as to give the short serviceentrant  a 50 per  cent, chance of a permanent commission, and it is found in practice that about 75 percent, of those officers ottered permanent commissions desire to accept them. Hitherto no actual difficulty has  arisen  in securing sufficient suitable officers  to fill the permanent vacancies though  such a difficulty might arise if  the numbers entering  for short service were still further reduced.    9. The  primary problem  for the Air  Force  is therefore to  obtain  officers  for  short  servicecommissions and the primary desideratum to devise terms of service which will attract candidates onthis basis.  An important consideration in devising such  term.3 must naturally be the attractivenessof the permanent career since the  prospect of this  is to  many candidates a governing factor.  It is however no solution  of the problem  of the Air Force to improve the permanent career without at thesame time providing means of attracting the candidate who desires to serve for three years or for five years only under the short service scheme.
