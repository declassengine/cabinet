Proposal to  impose  a    5  per  cent,  surcharge  on  the  Customs  duty  on  Cotton    Piece-Goods.       MEMORANDUM BY&quot; THE  SECRETARY  OF STATE  FOR INDIA.   I  circulate, for the  information of  my  colleagues,  two  telegrams from  theGovernment of India indicating their Budget proposals for 1931-2.   The point which  I ivjsh to  bring  to  the  attention and  consideration of mycolleagues is proposal (a) in para. 8  (which appears again as proposal (6) in para. 10)ot  the long telegram  dated  14th January, viz. to impose a  temporary surcharge of5 per cent. Customs duty on cotton piece-goods a measure which it is estimated willyield Rs. 1 &apos;20 crores (about  900,000).  The case for the imposition of this surchargeis stated in the second  telegram,  No. 183 S., dated 16th January.                                                                      \Y.

Customs, Taxes on Income, Currency and Debt  Charges account for practically whole of deterioration  in both years.  Under Customs, following areitems under which large drop is expected in current year :      Cotton  piece-goods, 370 ;  Tobacco, 3 20 ;  Iron and  Steel Protective Duty, 110;         Jute, 90.  For the next year we assume very moderate improvement.   Extraordinary items include  32 for transfer to revenue  balance of Austrianliquidation account and compensation of lb&quot; to Lascars or their dependants for loss or damage caused  during the war.  Other items  need no  special explanation, exceptthat  next year&apos;s Budget provides no new major works whatever, and  considerable cutshave been made  even under works in progress.  But no retrenchment of pay or postshas been allowed for.   5. Departmental  transactions.  Figures in para. 2 result in net contribution fromRailways of 574 in Revised, and 536  in Budget:  Details are : -    Receipts,  9783,  1,04,22;   Working  expenses and  surplus  profits,  6920,  6950Interest and1,031, 486.other charges,3320, 3422 ;  Transfers  from reserve funds,   As under Customs, Railway receipts  have been  considerably affected by present economic and political situation, necessitating heavy drafts on  railway reserve  funds in both years.   Indian Posts  and Telegraphs Department is expected to show  deficit of 150 in Revised and  160 in Budget.   Net Military expenditure has been taken at5430 in both years, including 10 for Territorial Forces.   6. On above estimates, which do not  for the present include transactions relatingto dissolution  of the Indo-European  Telegraph Department, Revenue  Deficit  wouldbe 1.5,13 in Revised,  which  must go  to  swell  unproductive debt,  and 18,10 inBudget.   7. Finance Department propose to balance Budget as follows :  Customs proposals as in para.  10,  1002 ; Income Tax proposals  as in para. 11, 428 ; Retrenchment in military,, in view of fall in prices and by extending contract period by one year,  175 ;possible Retrenchment in Civil expenditure, after allowing for inevitable new items of expenditure not included in above estimates,  25.  Total, 16,30.   This still leavesabout 180,  and, unless substantial further measures of retrenchment  can be devised,which  is unlikely,  Finance  Department propose to add one pie all round to IncomeTax  above  Rs. 2,000, which would  produce 91, and  to raise Revenue  estimates byabout 90.   This would just balance Budget.   8. These proposals were discussed in Council in the absence  of the Viceroy to-day,and  accepted provisionally, except on the following points, which were reserved forfurther discussion  in the presence  of the Viceroy, and for further  examination incertain cases :      (a) Five per cent, surcharge on  Cotton Piece goods.     (b) Retrenchment of 175 in Military Budget.   It is doubtful  if  so  much can be         realised without seriously endangering contract programme.     (c) Retrenchment in Civil  expenditure.   This  is being  examined  and  fixed         figures are still very uncertain.     (d) Civil Aviation estimates.     (e) Additional one pie on  Income Tax.   It is proposed to treat Income Tax as         adjusting item, and to vary increase to fit in with fixed figures.   On all  these  items we shall be  telegraphing you  fully later.  We  are  communi-cating position to  you  in present  provisional stage so that you may give  it yourpreliminary consideration and telegraph your observations.  This  is important mview of shortness of time and wide, scope of proposals.    9.  Figures  given above might be modified if we can utilise 53, being estimated netproceeds from  Indo-European sale,  to assist budget position.  Finance Departmentpropose two alternative methods, either to include whole  of x^roceeds as Revenue mBudget or to place to special Suspense Account, which may be drawn upon to meetspecial capital expenditure,  such as inauguration of  trans-India air mail service and construction of landing grounds.  We prefer latter proposal, which we consider fully justified, and should be glad of your early observations.
   10. Customs proposals. General  plan is  to make increases in import and excise duties, which may be classified as follows : -    (a) Permanent increases.    (b) A provisional increase (in the case of  sugar) pending the report of the Tariff        Board.    (c) Temporary surcharge  to  be  imposed to meet present emergency, and to be        withdrawn when the budgetary position permits:   Rates of increase have been regulated with purpose of putting maximum burden on articles of luxury and otherwise of distributing increase according to circumstances affecting each class  of  goods.   Idea  of equal all-round percentage  surcharge is impracticable.   The effect of the proposals may be summarised as follows :     (1) Articles selected for special treatment:        (a) Liquors, permanent increase of 61 ;       (b) Tobacco, &amp;c, temporary surcharge,  15 ;       (c) Sugar, provisional increase (Re. 1 per cwt.), 101 ;       id) Silver, permanent increase (2 annas per ounce), 50.       (e)  Mineral oils, temporary surcharge:  Kerosene,  increase of both excise and          customs duties by f- anna to 2\ and 3 annas  per  gallon,  respectively, 95.          Motor Spirit, increase by 2 annas to 8 annas per gallon, 90.      (/)  (i) Betel Nuts, permanent change  from 15 per cent, to 30 per cent, of          schedule (no surcharge on that), 30 ;  (ii) Spices, same as above, .10 ; and          (iii)  Cinema films, same as above, 4.       (g)  Motor Cars, temporary surcharge of 10 per cent., 30.      Qi)  Galvanised sheets, permanent  increase  (new protective duty),  50.   Total          of 1  (a) to (h)  536.    (2) Non-protective special  duties. Special temporary surcharges producing in        all 14.   (For details see Appendix 2.)*&apos;    (3) Articles subject to  10 per cent,  duty (Part IV  of  Schedule).   Temporary        surcharge of 2\ per cent., producing 15.    (4)  Articles subject to 15 per cent, revenue duty  (Part V of Schedule).  Temporary        surcharge on all articles of 5  per  cent, (except those selected for special        treatment as noted above, viz. betel nuts, spice, cinema films).    (5) Articles  subject  to  30 per  cent, duty (Part VI of  Schedule).  Temporary        surcharge of 10  per cent, 30.    (6)  Cotton piece-goods.  Temporary surcharge of 5 per cent., 120.           Total 1002.   11.  Income Tax proposals :     Income Tax:       (a)  Reduce minimum limit from  Rs. 2,000  to Rs. 1,500, and  impose tax of          6 pies in rupee on incomes of Rs. 1,500 to Rs. 1,999.   This will produce 50.      (b)  Increase existing scales as  follows :              On incomes of Rs. 2,000 to 4,999, add 3 pies ;  Rs.  5,000 to 29,999, add          4 pies; Rs. 30,000  and  over,  add  5  pies.  Change  altogether  will          produce 373.    Super Tax :       (a)  Except in  the case of Hindu  undivided  families,  lower minimum  to          Rs. 30,000 and levy 9 pies, in respect of all  incomes between Rs. 30,000          and 50,000 on excess over Rs.  30,000.   Will prodiice, (i)  from new super-          tax payers  11, (ii)  from added charge on existing super-tax payers, who          will now have to pay on excess over Rs. 30,000 instead of as formerly only          on excess  over Rs. 50,000, 13.      (b) Increase existing  scale of super-tax by 2 pies.   This will produce 21,  total          468,  less allowance  for refunds 40.  Net increase 428.&quot;   12.  Ways and Means.  Receipts.

Total, 1,10,19, 7600.    13. Above Estimates are based on the following assumptions : -    (1) In current  year there will be further sterling loan of  6,000,000 as assumed         in your estimates.    (2) Treasury Bills  outstanding at the close of both years will be 5000 with Public         and 556 in Paper Currency Reserve.    (3) Sterling purchases and sales during rest of  current financial year will balance,         while aggregate remittances next year will be  33,500,000.  Railway capital         expenditure has been further drastically cut  down.   Next year Rupee Loan,         allowing for repayments of maturing bonds, involves raising about &apos;$%- crores       -  of new money. If we obtain more we should utilise it in reducing Treasury         Bills with public.   Estimates will have  to be revised at a later stage in view         of arrangements which may be made for renewal of advances from Imperial         Bank of India and  postponement of redemption of war loan liabilities.         Telegram from Government of.India to Secretary of Stale for India,                             dated 16th January 1931.    183 S.  With  reference  to  (a)  in  para. 8 of our Budget telegram  ] 53 S. of13th January, question of surcharge on cotton piece-goods has  been further discussedunder Viceroy&apos;s presidency and we are provisionally in favour  of its levy.    2.  We recognise  there are certain objections, the force of which some of us feelmore  than others :  (a) theoretically,  impropriety  of  placing  surcharge for revenuepurposes on protective  duty without  countervailing excise ;  and (6) practical danger -that Assembly may . take opportunity to  eliminate British preference  by accepting-surcharge on British imports while rejecting surcharge on foreign imports.    3.  As regards  (a),  even if theoretical argument  is fully accepted we are agreedthat it is impossible for political reasons  to  re-impose excise.  Further, according to finance Members  statement in  Budget speech last year, duty on all piece-goods was-increased to 15 per cent, as revenue measure and it was only additional 5 per cent.on  non-British  goods  and minimum of 3i annas per pound on plain grey goods  that were  treated as  protective.   This consideration at least weakens theoretical argument.    4.  As to (b); possibility of embarrassment may  be admitted, although it is not atall  improbable  that,  inasmuch as general  surcharge  will be  welcome  to most vocalinterests, it  will  be accepted  without  much  argument.  In any  case, as  againstpossibility of  embarrassment from  this course,  it  may  be  argued  that  political-embarrassment of  omitting cotton piece-goods from  proposals for  surcharge of 5 percent,  on whole range of 15 per cent, duties would be far greater.    Finance Member  does not in fact see how lie  could defend  position  against attackthat we had again selected cotton piece-goods as one article to  lag behind general lineof  revenue duties.   There will, moreover, be much more force  behind  this attackbecause mill-owners&apos; practical  interests will  be at stake,  whereas  objections to-retaining existing inequality are  merely sentimental.    5. We are submitting case in this manner for your consideration before taking-final   decision,  but Honourable  Member,  Finance, has made it clear that he  does-not see how, without inclusion  of this rjroposal,  he  can raise sufficient revenues owpresent a budget which has even a remote chance  of gaining sufficient support in.the Assembly.    6. We should be grateful for your earlj- observations by telegram.
