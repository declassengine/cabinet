SUND&amp;Y OPENING ,OF PL&amp;CE5 OF ENT .ERT.I,XKLISNT.          Memorandum by.. the Home Secretary.     I have already called the attention of ray  colleagues  tothe very difficult situation which has arisen out  of  therecent judgment of the Courts  on the question of the  Sunday opening of cinemas and other places of entext^adhoment.    Somesolution of the difficulty must be found without delay,  and  Iam afraid that unfortunately the intervention of the  Governmontis inevitable.     The effect of the recent  decision in  the Courts  is  briefly.that the Sunday Observance Act, 1780 is still fully  in forceand that no person or authority has any power to grantexemption from, or to give any consent to  the breach  of  its provisions.    This Act provides that it is illegal to  open for public entert-ainment or amusement-on Sundays any  house,room or other place to which persons are admitted  by  paymentof money, or by tickets sold for money.     The statute has long been felt to be  out &amp;f harmony with modern conditions, and for many years now  no attempt  has beenmade to enforce it strictly.    &quot;The position with  regard to  thevarious t3&quot;pes of Sunday entertainment is as follows:-(1)  Sunday Gone arts.     When in 1889 the London County Council became the  authorityfor music and dancing licences in  London,  they  took  no  actionto prevent concerto  on Sunday  if they were not  given for private gain or by way of trade.    In 1897 they were fortifiedto some extent by a  case in the High Court (Williams v,  Wright
                                                         SY SJ S$                                                         O (J e*13 T.L.R.  551) which  laid  it &quot;down... &quot;thai;.... the -Sunday &quot;Giv**srvs.roc^-.Act was not  infringed by the giving of a concert to whichadmission  was free though  a charge was made for reserved seats.     In 1909 the London County Council revised their regulationsabout Sunday concerts and  provided that such concerts shouldbe allowed only when  the entertainment would be given byrecognised societies  or organisations unconnected with thepremises concerned and only when accompanied by undertakings thatthe concerts will be  properly conducted and not for privategain or by way of trade;   that the licensee or his servantswill have  nothing to  do with the arrangements for the concertsand that none of the  persons employed at the premises on weekdays will  have any pressure put upon him to assist at Sundayconcerts.    A balance sheet was required.    The lord chamberlain followed  the example of the London County Councilin regard to Sunday concerts held in theatres in aid ofcharity, but he required that not less than 25 per cent, ofthe gross  takings should be given to the charity.     Considerable doubt, however, has been thrown upon the doctrine laid down in the  case of Williams v. Wight &quot;bythe recent judgment of the Court of Appeal, and to judge by the remarks of Lord Justice Scrutton it is very doubtful whether,if the legality of Sunday  concerts were now challenged, theCourts would hold that the mere fact that a certain number ofpersons were admitted free of charge was sufficient to taketne concerts outside  the scope of the Act.     Outside London,  the practice of giving Sunday concertshas been less common, but  it has recently been becoming more general, especially in seaside towns.
                                                           9 *j a                                                           ft) ci i (2)   Stage Plays in Theatres.     The London Counts&apos;- Council is also the licensing-author!ty-of about a quarter of the theatres in London, and in dealingwith theatres the Council followed the example of the lord chamberlain (who is responsible under the Theatres Act, 1843,for licensing three-quarters of the London theatres) inprohibiting the opening of theatres on Sunday for stage plays.     Outside London where the Justices are the licensing authority, I understand that no public performances- of stageplays have been allowed in theatres on Sundays.(3)  Cinemas.     A year or two after the passing of the  Cinematograph Act,1909 (which required  the premises in which cinematographexhibitions are given to be licensed bj/ the  Count;/ Council,County Borough Council or other delegated authority) someof the cinematograph  theatres in London began to  giveexhibitions on Sunday, and in 1916 the London County Councildeoided to give permission to such premises  being opened on sunday in their area, subject to certain conditions, namely that:-     (l)  the entertainment will be of a healthy  character          and properly conducted.     (2)  an amount to be determined by the  Council  as          representing the profit from the entertainment          will be  paid, in respect of  ee-ch prohibited  day          on which an entertainment is given, tc  a  charity          approved by the Council.     (3)  no performance will begin before 6 p.in. or finish          1 at e r t h an  11 p. m.     (4)  no peroon will be  employed-on Sunday who  has  been          employed in connection with  cinematograph          entertainments for  each of the previoxis six  da:/s.     The  practice  of  the London County Council in regard  tocinemas was an  extension of  the principle they had  alreadyapplied to Sunday  concerts.   There is nothing in  the cinema to-graph Act which gives the Council any  authority for  over-riding,in respect of cinematograph  exhibitions, the general lawregarding public entertainments on Sunday.
^            The number  of  cinemas  opened  on  Sunday  in  London under        the  arrangements described  above steadily  increased  and  a        year or two  ago  the managers  of the theatres and music halls        began  to protest against  the  unfair competition of the cinemas.        They failed  to persuade  either the Lord Chamberlain  or the        London County Council  to  comply with  their requests  for        equality of  treatment  and finally  this  year they decided  to        take proceedings in the  High  Court with a  view  to  testing  the        legality of  the  action of the London  County Council  in granting        permission for the  opening  of the  Streatham Astoria  for        cinematograph exhibitions on  Sundays-  The KingTs  Bench        Division held that  the Council had no power to  give  such        permission and their decision was  upheld on appeal by  the        Court  of Appeal, both  Courts  passing  caustic criticism on  the        action of  the London County Council.            Notwithstanding    3 unequivocal  declaration cf  the  Courts,  I        the  Cinematograph p?    letors have continued their Sunday        exhibitions,  though \.  3 Lord  Chamberlain,  on my advice        after  consulting the Cabinet, has  declined to permit any        further Sunday concerts in  theatres  licensed by him,.            As soon as  the Appeal  was decided I made arrangements to        receive deputations from the  interests affected.   The  first        deputation was from the London County Council whose  representa-        tives  were mainly anxious to  secure  legislation to legalise        their  past practice.   They  urged  that they should  be enabled to        permit the opening of  cin etaatograph theatres on  the same        conditions  as  they had imposed hitherto.  This  point of  view-        was  strongly supported by the second  deputation from the Cine-        matograph  Exhibitors who claimed  to  represent practically  all        the  cinema theatres in the  country.   They  urged that in  London        and  some other places  they  had been  meeting for many years a        public demand and they wished to  continue  on the  sane  conditions-        They pointed out that  in London they  had been instrumental last        37ear in  contributing  about   180,000 a year to approved ..-  charities-[                                       -4-
                                                               i\ JftjThe third deputation was from representatives of the TheatricalInterests v/ho complained that they were at a serious disadvantageas compared with the cinemas and that the competition of the sunday cinema was gravely affecting their industry    They asked5logically enoughs for the some treatment as the cinemas9 though they were Inclined to regard as hypocritical the pretensionsthat the profits of Sunday cinemas were devoted entirely or evenmainly to charity,,   They claimed that while the theatres pudmusic-halls provided a considerable amount of British labour whichwould be increased by Sunday opening? the profits of the cinemawent largely into American pockets?   Accompanying the deputationwore representatives of the Unions to which the workers employedin theatres belong and they supported the demand for Sunday opening on the understanding  (to which the Managers agreed) thatthe six day week should be safeguarded and fair conditions shouldbe imposed in respect of Sunday labourc   This deputationadmitted that opinion among the artistes on the question wasdividedo          The fourth deputation was organised by the Lord&apos;s DayObservance Society and included representatives of the artistes&apos;Section of the Stage Guild who claimed to speak for about 35000actors and actresses0   The members of the Society were opposedon religious grounds to all Sunday entertainments and urged thatthere should be no departure from the main principles of theLord&apos;s Day Observance A.ct0   The representatives of the actors had sought the Society7s Aid because they hoped thereby to avoid the sunday opening of theatres-  they wished-to keep Sunday as theirrest cay5 but what they particularly feared was that Sunday opening would sooner or later- lead to seven days&apos;  work for six days&apos;  -pay u
           Representatives  of  the  Council  of  Christian Ministers  on Social Questions were  also received by officials of the Home Office0   They claimed  to  represent moderate religious  opinion not only in the Church  of  England, but among the  Free Churches,    &apos;./hile  supporting  the principle of the Christian Sunday,  they recognised  the duty  of considering the needs of  the  public and they were  prepared to let the question be dealt  with by local option,,  In their view., however  the  conditions of Sunday opening should be  determined by Parliament  and any new legislation should include provisions  to  prohibit  commercial profit, to limit hours,, to safeguard  a dayss rest, and  to control the quality of the entertainments           It is obvious that  in a controversy of  this kind, no solution can be suggested  which will satisfy everyone*   There are those  who from sincere religious conviction look upon Sundajr entertainments as contrary to Divine  law.   There are others who regard all restrictions  based  on  Sunday observance as an unjustifiable infringement  of their freedom.   Between these  two  extremes is the  large though perhaps less vocal body cf moderate opinion which9 while  willing  and even  anxious to maintain,  for social if not religious  reasons, the traditional English Sunday,  recognises the  need for providing  reasonable recreation especially in the  large  towns.    The question mainly affects  London;   for outside  London, Sunday  cinemas are exceptional and  even concerts are -less common, and some of the largest  centres  like  Manchester and Birmingham allow no Sunday entertainments0    In London the public has developed the  Sunday cinema habit  and will not  lightly tolerate the loss of it0    The cinema has been  called the poor man&apos;s theatre  and it is the poorer members of the community who  will  suffer most by the deprivation of Sunday recreation.    The closing of cinemasmight well  lead  them  to far less desirable ways of spending their Sunday leisure,
S% &apos;A O&apos;.j U \JAfter careftil consideration of the problenNoi 1 have come tothe- conclusion that there are only two courses open to theGovernment.&apos;Tne fxrst aIternative is to leave the existing law as defined by the.e Courts to tafee its course.This woild mean notonly the closing of cinemas on Sunday, but also the prohibition oother forms of entertainment such as concerts which have beentacitly accepted for many years even by the stricter type ofview, wo-&quot;.Id be disastrous, and ie, I think, out of the question.There wo :id be a considerable public outcry against theGovernment and we should expose ourselves to the charge of beingkill-j oys.     The second alternative is to amend the law so as to allowcertain entertainments to be given on Sunday subject to conditionThis possibly involves an extension of Sunday entertainmentsbeyond the present limits, because it would be grossly unfair- toleave cinemas in a specially privileged position.   If the open-ing of Sunday cinemas is to be legalised similar privileges must also be given to theatres;  it can be argued with great forcethat tht. drama has even stronger claims from the artistic and educational point of view.     I suggest, therefore, for the consideration of the Cabinetthat if they agree that legislation is required it should be -based on the following principles:-     (l)   The question whether Sunday entertainments should beallowed should be left to the decision of the local licensing authorities.   The only form of entertainments which need beconsidered are those which are held in premises licensed for stage plays, cinematograph exhibitions, or music and dancing.In some instances  the licensing authorities for these respectivepremises are different and this may give rise to anomalies.In a single area one authority may decide to allow cinemas toSabbatarian.To my mind such a course from the social point of
CJ FJ KJopen on Sundays while another authority denies that privilege totheatres.    Unfortunately there appears to be no method of over-coming the difficulty, apart from a far reaching change in the law/ which would concentrate all these licensing powers in thehands of one authority.     (2)   The licensing authority should be required to satisfyitself that there is a general demand in the area for the openingof the premises on Sunday  and that such opening would be in thepublic interest.   Procedure by local referendum is probablyundesirable^ but the licensing authority might be required to giveadequate public notice of its intentions and full opportunity shouldbe given to all interests to object and for these objections to be heard, before a final decision is arrived at.     (3)   The element of private gain should, as far as possible,be eliminated;  receipts in excess of certain specified expenditure should be  given to local or national charities approved by the licensing authority.     (There is good reason to believe that the London CountyCouncil have hitherto failed to prevent the cinemas in London fromderiving substantial profit from Sunday opening and it isunderstood that they have had under consideration the questionof revising their requirements).     (4)   Adequate safeguards should be enacted to preventpersons employed in a place of entertainment from being employedmere than six days a week.           The licensing authorities should be entitled to imposect..,:r conditions bearing on the hours of opening and thecharacter of the entertainment.     A hill on these lines, if approved, must clearly beintroduced as a Government  measure, and, in the present state ofParliamentary business it would be impossible to introduce legislation unless there is reasonable ground for believing that                           -C-
-9-it would &quot;be accepted &quot;by all parties as a fair- compromise andwould be passed through all its stages practically as anunopposed measure.     I suggest, therefore, for the consideration of the Cabinetthat if it is agreed that legislation is necessary, and that legislation should, be on the lines proposed &quot;07/ me, steps should be taken to consult privately the Leaders of theOpposition Parties with a view to ascertaining whether their support would be forthcoming.  It will be remembered that attheir meeting on the 23th January last (Cabinet Conclusions10(31) Conclusion 8) the Cabinet agreed that if pressed tostate the future policy of t?:ie Government on the subject, thePrime &apos; Minister should intimate that legislation would berequired, and that he was In consultation with, the Leadersof the Opposition Parties with this object.     If the Government are going to take any action toamend the law, it is In my view desirable that the necessary legislation should be Introduced at the earliest moment.At present the continuing defiance of the Sunday ObservanceAct is bringing the lav; into contempt.                           .(Initialled) 1* Lk C.Home Office.     16. 2. 31.
