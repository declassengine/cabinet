Conference on the Voluntary School Problem.             Jo,int Mgrao randum^ by the         President of the Board offEduca/t ion.                 Minister &quot;&quot;of Health&apos;                       and              Pijrot CoKinlo-oipne^ of Worlcs.          The Committee appointed by the Cabinet attended the Conference on the voluntary^rj&quot;- School question, held atthe Board of Education, at which representatives of thefive chief interests were present.  The proposals foraiding Voluntary Schools (see Cabinet Paper 418(30)) were put before the Conference.          On the first day a large measure of agreement wasevinced, after which a Committee amended the proposals in several important respects.   On the second day the amended proposals were discussed anew.  Finally, itappeared that the representatives of the Church cfEngland and the Roman Catholics were prepared to acceptthe proposals on behalf of their Churches.  Tho representativesof the Authorities  and of the Teachers also were preparedto agree, though they  could not, to the same extent,  oommittheir Organisations.  The Nonconformists remained dissatisfied.In their amended form, however, the proposals are morefavourable to  the Nonconformist position  than those  putforward by the  Government last  year.     (l)  The Voluntary Managers are required,  in  the first        instance,  to provide at  least  25 per  cent,  of the       money  involved, and nay  be required to provide 50  per        cent.
  (2)  Two alternative methods of appointing reserved     teachers have been inserted, on the whole more     favourable to public control.  (3)  A proposal has been inserted, is,rrely at the     suggestion of Dr. Workman and enlarged with the good-     will of the Church of England representatives, which     secures undenominational teaching in all &quot;singlo-     school areas&quot; and wherever children are tra.ii3ferred     for reorganisation purposes.          The nonconformists appreciated the value of these concessions, but persisted in the opinion that thepresent proposals were not merely emergency propo.oa.ls arjthose of last year,, but were of a permanent character.In this respect it was pointed out that they did not differ materially from last year, but were to meet thesame emergency.          Our predominant impression of the Conference wasthe amount of agreement secured, rather than the absenceof complete unanimity.  The fact that the Nonconformistsare not reconciled i3 serious.  But it is even lesspossible to ignore the fact that the proposals are accept-ahle to the representatives of the  othor four partiesdirectly interested.          The representatives of the teachers were partioular-ly insistent that  it wa,s a valuable increase of publiccontrol that all  the teachers in these schools so aidedwould become public  servants  of  the Authority  instead ofservants of the Managers.  The representatives of  the LocalAuthorities attached great importance  to the assistance whichthe  proposals would  give to the  efficient and  economicaldevelopment of  education  in their areas.    There wa3  ageneral desire  that  the passage  of  the Education Bill shouldnot  be  jeopardised by failure to  find  a  solution  of  the
findifficulties involved.           We append a copy of the amended proposals.   Werecommend that legislation he undertaken on theee lines.It will he necessary for a definite announcement te &quot;benade hy the President as soon as the Education Bill comesup for further discussion on Wednesday, January  21st.He must then state whether  ,it is the intention of theGovernment to legislate and, if so, he will certainly he asked as to the date  of the introduction of the Bill.
