      At its meeting on the 4th instant the Cabinet decided(Cabinet Conclusions ll(3l) Conclusion 11) to postpone,  pendingthe receipt of a report of what had taken place recently atGeneva, the consideration of my memorandum CP.13(31) suggesting the policy which the Government should pursue with regard to thequestion of the nationality of women.      1 nov/ understand from the Foreign Office that, at the recent meeting of the Council of the League of Nations, the Counciladopted unanimously a proposal submitted by the representatives ofGuatemala, Peru and Venezuela.  A copy of this proposal is attached,from which it will be seen that the Council decided  (l) to placeon the Agenda of the next Session of the Assembly the question ofthe continued study of the nationality of the wife, and (2) to ask the Secretary General to submit to the Assembly a report on thequestion after consultation with certain women&apos;s organisations;the Council also decided to ask the Secretary General, if he thought fit, to request these organisations to set up a Committee, consistinof two representatives of each organisation  , with the task offormulating joint proposals to be attached to the Report to besubmitted to the Assembly,      The recent proceedings at the Council do not affect, in my view, the proposals which I have submitted to the  Cabinet in memorandum CP.13(31).  I think my colleagues will agree that weshould be exposing ourselves to considerable criticism if wepostponed consideration of the question of the nationality of womenuntil after the next meeting of the Assembly of the League.

introduced by the late Dr. Bentham is reached.   We shall  be ina very strong position if we can report to the  League inSeptember next that, so far as this country was concerned,  wehad decided upon our policy and that we were prepared tointroduce the necessary legislation to give effect to that policy as soon as circumstances permitted.      I should be glad, therefore, if the Cabinet would now take my memorandum  (C.P.13(3l)) into consideration and would cometo a decision as to the policy which the Government should pursue on this question.                                         il a R .

                     LEAGUE OF NATIONS.                                          0.125.1931.V,Translation.                                 Geneva,                                               January 23rd,  1931..Communicated tothe Council.              QUESTION OF THE NATIONALITY OF THE WIFE.            Proposal submitted by the Representatives               of Guatemala, Peru and Venezuela.      The Council will remember that the question of the nationality of the wife was discussed at length at the conference for the Codification of International Law held at The Hague inMarch and April 1930.  The discussions did not result in aninternational settlement of this question.  The States were, inparticular, recommended to study the question whether it would notbe possible (l) to introduce into their law the.principle of theequality of the sexes in matters of nationality, taking particularlyinto consideration the interests of the children, and (2) especially to decide that in principle the nationality of  the wife shouldhenceforth not be affected without her consent  either by the merefact of marriage or by any change in the nationality of her husband.      It is to be noted that there is a clear movement of opinion throughout the world in favour of a suitable settlement of thisquestion.      Various members of the Council have  received petitions fromwomen&apos;s organisations urging the Council to appoint a committee ofwomen to consider the question of the nationality  of the wife and submit a report on the subject to the 1931 Assembly.      We venture to propose the adoption by the Council of thefollowing resolution:     &quot;The Council,     &quot;Decides to plaoe on  the agenda of the next session of  the   Assembly  the question of  the continued study  of  the nationality   of the wife, and
   &quot;Requests the Secretary-General to submit  to  the  Assemblya report on the question after consultation of  the followingorganisations which have been specially concerned with the nationality of the wife:   The international council of women,   The international women suffrage alliance,   The women&apos;s international league for peace and freedom,   The Inter-American Commission of women,   The Equal Rights International,   The world women1s union,   The All-Asian congress of women,   The international federation of university women,   The young women&apos;s Christian association.   &quot;The Secretary-General might, if he thinks fit, request the above-named organisations to set up a committee consistingof two representatives  of each organisation with the task offormulating  joint proposals to be attached to the report tobe submitted to the Assembly&quot;.
