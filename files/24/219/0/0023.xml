Lindsay to Mr. A. Henderson. (Received January 14, 1931.)  (No. 2077.)  Sir,                                        Washington, December 31, 1930.      I HAVE read with much interest Sir William Clark&apos;s despatch No. 267 of  the 12th December, 1930, to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, regarding  the Canadian attitude towards questions  arising out of the recent Imperial  Conference.      2.  In paragraphs 8 and 9 of that despatch Sir William Clark refers to the  probability that the Canadian Government will seek to provide itself with lines  of retreat in case the forthcoming Economic Conference at Ottawa should prove  abortive, and mentions, as one such possible line of retreat,  a &quot; rapprochement  with the United States of America.&quot;   He states, in this connexion, that &quot; a few  passing and not very precise press references to a desire on the part of the United  States Government for a measure of mutual tariff concessions with Canada hardly  warrant the assumption that the United States of America is  ready to modify its  traditional policies for the sake of its northern neighbour.&quot;      3.  With this statement I entirely agree.   I do not, in fact, observe that any important part  of the electorate in the United States tends to cry out againstI protection as the genesis of its ills.   So far as -what may be termed  the oppositionI parties are concerned (i.e., the Democrats and the &quot; insurgent &quot; Republican groupI in the agricultural west), the former &quot; low tariff &quot; plank of the  Democratic partyv has practically disappeared, while the farmers as a whole demand more protection,  not less.  While orthodox Republican newspapers and spokesmen try to  make  political capital by asserting that if the Democrats were returned  to power they  would make heavy  reductions in American tariff  rates, the Democratic leaders,  with very few exceptions, dislike the suggestion.  They are  afraid of its effects  on the voters in  the distressed agricultural areas and in the wet industrial urban  areas, and to some extent in the &quot; liquefying &quot; south.  Indeed, I think it likely  that in the next ten or fifteen years the Republicans will do more tariff reducing  than  the  Democrats will do, or would  do if  they were in office;  but neither  Republicans nor Democrats at the present time  would take  the political risk  involved  in reductions  in  the agricultural rates  in  which  Canada is  most  interested.      4.  So far  as  the Republicans are  concerned,  their efforts are being now  directed towards making the  United States  a closed  market for agricultural  products diversifying agriculture, reducing the acreage under crops that now  produce an exportable surplus, so as to  make  the import duties really effective  and have prices determined by the  interplay of demand and  supply on the  domestic market.   That has been President Hoover&apos;s ambition for many  years  (indeed, a little  while ago he enunciated the view to me with  the utmost clarity),  and the Federal Farm  Board have been preaching that doctrine since their estab-  lishment.   They know, of course, that the United States cannot consume all the  raw cotton she produces, but in the case of wheat they believe the goal is not far  distant.   Mr. Legge,  the chairman of the board, said as much to the commercial  counsellor the other day, when Sir John Broderick took Mr. Parker  Moloney,  the Australian Minister of  Markets, to see him.  He said they were striving to  get out of the world&apos;s wheat market, and, turning  to Sir John, he added that the  United States authorities would have no inclination to criticise any arrangements  which His Majesty Government might decide to make for the purpose of granting  preferential treatment to Empire-grown wheat or other agricultural  produce.  The aim of the  board was to  induce American farmers to produce just enough,  or  less than enough,  wheat,  corn, &amp;c,  for the requirements of this country.  Satisfactory progress was being made in that direction, and  they would soon, he  was confident, &quot;pass  out of the world picture.&quot;   Then the  tariff would enable  them to resist the depressing influence of world surpluses.January 14,  1931.      9 PVQ    SECTION 1.[334 o-1]
&amp;iti       Meanwhile, it: is interesting to. note that the Farm  Board  favour  a.:..temip&apos;oTar,y;; embanga., on - wheat.  In a letter-to Senator Capper, made public on -the 25th instant, Mr. Legge used the following language :           &quot; The wheat situation seems to be getting worse every day.   The spread      between Chicago and Winnipeg is running from 26 cents to 28 cents a bushel,      and, inasmuch as the millers always pay a premium for that Manitoba wheat,      any further  decline in  the  market will probably result in wheat being      imported from Canada.   Probably the most  effective method of dealing      with this would be a temporary embargo on  wheat imports, which would      seem justifiable in view of the fact that we  will have a burdensome surplus      without importing any.&quot; Senator Capper  is prepared to introduce an Embargo Bill &quot;if the fears of seriously competitive imports materialise,&quot; while certain Congressmen are urging the Tariff Commission to increase the duty from 42 cents to 63 cents a bushel.      6.   It is reasonable, I think, to conclude from the foregoing that  proposals for  &quot;a measure of mutual tariff concessions&quot; between the  United States  and Canada would  meet  with  a  frigid reception  from the present  Republican Administration in Washington if it involved a reduction of American  duties on Canadian wheat,  and it is  difficult  to see what measure that did  not  include concessions  in  the wheat duties  could have useful political reactions for the Canadian  Government.  If the Democrats have  a  policy for  the  relief of American wheat  growers without resort to protective duties, they have never proclaimed  the fact, nor has it been possible to  observe a desire  on the part of any important political group in this country to make tariff concessions of any kind to Canada.   They all desire to live on neighbourly terms with Canada and to export their goods to the Canadian market, but much more substantial practical pressure than now exists will be required before either of the two leading parties will consider modifying American agricultural policy  in Canada&apos;s favour.      7.   Moreover, the modification of the  American  tariff rates for the benefit of Canada alone  would seem to require a prior revision of the whole commercial treaty policy of the United States  inaugurated in 1923.   Up to that time the United States Government had placed upon the &quot;most-favoured-nation &quot; clauses included in  their  commercial treaties the &quot;conditional &quot; interpretation, that is to say, that privileges extended by the United States to one particular  foreign country could not be claimed under a &quot; most-favoured-nation &quot;  clause by another country, except in return for the same or an equivalent concession.   They would have been able, for instance, to negotiate a reciprocity treaty with Canada in  1911 without raising difficulties with other  countries  with which they had  concluded  &quot; most-favoured-nation &quot; treaties.   In 1923, however, under  the guidance  of Mr. Charles E. Hughes, the United States Government announced their intention for the future to seek complete unconditional equality of treatment for  American trade, and,  in  return, to offer unconditional equality of treatment to  the trade of other countries.  As a logical preparatory step  to the execution  of that new policy, the tariff preference till then granted by Brazil to American products was voluntarily  abandoned, and  negotiations for new  treaties were begun  with  a number of European and Latin American countries, several of which have since been successfully  concluded, e.g., those with  Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia,  Roumania,  &amp;c.   Every one  of  those treaties, I believe, contains a provision for  reciprocal unconditional &quot;most-favoured-nation&quot; treatment in customs matters.  The  new departure which they represent was the outcome of a series  of studies  made by the United States  Tariff Commission after the war on reciprocity and  commercial  treaties.   The  commission,  in  a report  dated 1919, recommended,  inter alia, that &quot; so far as concerns general industrial policy and general tariff  legislation, each country the United States as well as others should be left free  to enact such measures as it deems expedient for its own welfare; but the measures  adopted, whatever they be,  should  be  carried out with the same terms  and the  same treatment for all nations.&quot;   The commission then went on to say that  some  allowance should  be  made  for exceptional  treatment, not  inconsistent, under  certain circumstances,  with  the principle  of  equality  of treatment,  and  it  instanced the following special circumstances in which the concession  of special  rates of duty might be regarded as not in conflict with the principle :        (1) Where one country  has  a  long  frontier line in common with another,             e.g., Spain and Portugal, Canada and the United States.
    (2): Where special political  ties and:special responsibilities exist,  eSg., theo ;;!;.:.*   United States and Hawaii formerly, the United States and Cuba-at          present.    evnrei/u;!- jjfihfolkA sd-i ixws -nnjai iM ^mtatii d.)5S off?    8.  It is noteworthy, however, that when the State Department (in a letter addressed to the New York representative of an Argentine newspaper  in 1923)explained the  American position, it made no mention of the exceptional circum-stances created by the existence of a common frontier.   The following extractfrom the letter specifies the only circumstances which it then apparently regardedas justifying concessions not granted to the other most favoured nations  :          &quot; The Department contemplates making similar overtures in  the near    future to other Latin American countries for the negotiation of new treaties,    or  the modification  of existing treaties,  in harmony with  this principle    (i.e., unconditional  equality of  treatment), excepting, however, as in the    recent exchange of notes with Brazil, the special treatment which the United    States accords, or hereafter  may accord, to Cuba, and the commerce between    the United States and its dependencies and the Panama Canal Zone.&quot;    9.  The existence of this new policy and of the numerous commercial treatiesbased upon it  complicates current American tariff difficulties with Prance.  the americans, in other words, find  it inconsistent with their announced commercial treaty policy  to  yield to French demands for  special tariff preferences,  andalthough the  long common  frontier  argument  might  conceivably be  brought forward in  favour of a special  arrangement with  Canada,  it seems highlyimprobable that the State Department would willingly raise so thorny a question.    10.  I am sending a copy of this despatch to the High Commissioner forthe United Kingdom at Ottawa.

The question of the statue in memory of Earl Halg       has been one which seems to have been fated to surround itself       with difficulties0  It will be within the recollection of my       colleagues that the resolution of Parliament praying His       Majesty to give directions for a monument to be erected to       Earl Haig was only passed after a division in which most of us       voted in favour of an amendment to refer the matter to a       Select committee   The amendment was9 however  lost and it fell       to my predecessorss first of all Lord Peel and then       Lord Londonderry^  to endeavour to give effect to the resolution       of the Commons,                 The next difficulty arose as to the question of a       site9 buts on the  advice of the Royal Pine Art Commissions the       late Government decided to over-rule the  objections of       the Westminster City Council to the site  selected between       the Scottish Office and the Royal United Services Institution       in the centre of Whitehall,,  A site having been selectedj,       the next question to be settled was that  of the sculptor.       Normally9 the practice of the department  would have been to       have selected an artist of established reputation to       undertake the commission.  My predecessorss howevers felt       that public opinion was in favour of a 3r&amp;roite* competition5                                1.
