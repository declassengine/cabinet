BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.9   Kij O&apos; (JPrinted for the Cabinet.  February  1931.SECRET.Copy  No. -  &apos;0\CP.  34  (31).CABINET.TIN  RESTRICTION.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE  FOR THE COLONIES.     1.. IN my memorandum  of the 9th January (CP.  7  (31)) I outlined certain proposals for an  international scheme of compulsory tin restriction.  I was not atthat date in a position to say whether the Government of the Federated Malay Statesaccepted the principle of restriction, but I proposed that, on that assumption,  Ishould be authorised to allow  Nigeria and Malaya to join  a compulsory restrictionscheme for the initial  period  of two years, on the definite understanding  that thescheme was controlled by representatives  of  the four Governments  concerned (theFederated  Malay States, Nigeria, the Netherlands East Indies and Bolivia), andthat I was satisfied as to the. details . The memorandum was considered by theCabinet at its meeting on the  21st January (Cabinet 9 (31)), when I explained thatMalaya had not yet agreed to the  details of the scheme.  The  Cabinet  decided thatthe subject should stand over  until an agreed scheme was  before them.     2.  The Federated Malay States Government had two main objections to theproposed scheme-the  fact that it was to operate retrospectively with effect fromthe 1st January, 1931, and the fact that it restricted only the export of tin and notits production.  It is unnecessary to discuss the reasons for these objections, since they have now been removed  by the substitution of the 1st March  as the date of operation  and by agreement  that the scheme  shall  restrict production as well asexport. These amendments have been accepted by Nigeria; I understand that theyhave also  been accepted by the Dutch and Bolivian  Governments steps are beingtaken to obtain formal confirmation of their acceptance; and the High Commissionerfor  the Malay States has now  asked that the scheme  as thus amended may besubmitted to the  Cabinet as approved by his Government.                                *     3.  It will be recalled that  the scheme prescribes quotas  in the form  of fixedpercentages based on the ratios of production in 1929.  The amount of the quotas  .may be varied by the International Committee, representing the four Governments,which is to control the scheme; but  their ratio is to remain constant.  Both the malayan and  the Nigerian Governments  are opposed to frequent changes of theamount of the quota;  but this is a matter  for discussion with the other members ofthe International  Committee,  and approval or rejection  of the  scheme does  not depend upon it.     4.  Although the details of the  restriction scheme have  necessarily  beendiscussed in secret, sufficient  information has  become public to ensure that those whose interests are concerned  are  aware of its general outline and any oppositionhas had time to find expression. The objections to the scheme are, in the main, thosewhich may be brought against restriction of  the output of any  raw material.Restriction is an  interference  with economic forces.  It increases costs.  It favoursthe inefficient or uneconomic producer. And it usually leads to a demand for moreand  more restriction and  higher  and higher  prices.   Messrs.  Lazarus and  Co.,the well-known metal-brokers, have estimated  that a reduction of 22  per  cent,  in output would increase the cost of production by 28 per cent. There is  also  the riskof encouraging the use of substitutes, i.e., glass for food  containers,  &amp;c.  And itappears to be the fact that the cost of production is highest in Bolivia.[5024]
    5.  Against  these  arguments  it may be. pointed  out that, if too much of a commodity  is  being  produced  for  the workTs  requirements  and  stocks  areaccumulating,  common sense  indicates  that   reduced  production  is  required.Reduction may be brought about either by restriction or by the elimination of theleast  lit.  Mere it is important to remember that, although Bolivia produces at ahigher cost  than Malaya,  the Dutch East Indies can produce more cheaply thanMalaya.  As between Malaya and the Dutch East  Indies the advantage of restrainingunlimited competition is all on the side of Malaya.    6.  I do not, therefore, see in any of the objections any good or sufficient reasonfor withholding consent to the restriction proposals.  Any further fall in the priceof tin at a time when rubber  is so low would involve serious financial consequences for Malaya, and it would require definite and very strong reasons to justify refusal to allow that territory to adopt  a policy which the Government and  the miningcommunity  consider  to be  in the interest of their leading industry.  In presentcircumstances the financial stability of Malaya  depends on a recovery in the priceof tin.  If output is not restricted, the price will fall steadily, and the effect mustbe disastrous in a country where the greater part of the labour force is of foreignorigin.  Even if it should be necessary  to restrict the production to a greater extent than  22 per cent, for a time in order to work off existing stocks, there is no dangerof the situation getting out of hand, as it did in the case of rubber.  The fact thatthe working of the scheme will be entirely in the hands of the four Governments,two of which are British, guarantees us against  that.  Nor is there the least dangerof the scheme being  nullified by a large increase in uncontrolled production.  Thescheme  covers 90 per cent,  of  the world&apos;s production.    7.  I therefore  ask that I may now be authorised to announce  publicly that HisMajesty&apos;s Government  have approved the scheme in principle, subject to my being satisfied as  to the details after negotiations with representatives of the netherlands and Bolivian Governments, and on the  definite understanding that the  scheme is controlled by representatives of the four Governments concerned.     Colonial  Office,  February 5,  1931.
