LOU    (TLID DOCUMENT  ISjIhEPROPBRTY  OF  HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT ).RET                          CABINET                     Sugar Beet  Subsidy.     Memorandum by  the  Minister  of Agriculture and Fisheries.     1.   As  a  matter of  extreme urgency,  I desire to lay before my colleagues  the  serious position  of the sugar-beetindustry in this  country.     2.   I may recall  that the  Labour Government, in 1924,decided that  it was in  the national interest to establish theindustry, and prepared  a  plan, which it was left to the succeedingGovernment to implement by legislation in  the British Sugar(Subsidy) Act,  1925,  for  assisting the industry by Exchequersubsidies during  an establishment  period of 10 years, 1924 - 1934.This  period was regarded  as the  minimum required for nursing theindustry, and compares  with many decades of special assistance given tothe sugar beet  industry by Governments on  the Continent and in theUnited States.     3.   The net provided for the payment of subsidy at thefollowing rates in  the  periods shown:-                 Years.                     Per cwt. of sugar.         1924-27 (inclusive)                       19s. 6d.         1928-30      1:                            13s. Od.         1931-33      ,!                             .6s. 6d.There is also a subsidy on molasses.     4.   Subsidisation on this  scale was  considered necessary,in 1924, to enable  sugar  beet  growers and  beet sugar factories to overcome successfully  the difficulties  inherent in theestao lishment of  a  new  industry.  The difficulties included, inter alia     (I) Initial  inefficiency of beet cultivation.    (II) Initial  inefficiency of factory  operation.In both respects, the industry has made marked progress, but,  inthe course  of its development, some growers and some factorieshave  naturally  had  longer experience and made greater progressthan others.  It  follows  that  some growers and some factories.                                1.
Loohave secured, better financial results then others.  Thegrowers, as a wholo, are steadily improving their yields,while none of the factories can now be described as technicallyinefficient.  As was intended, the more efficient factorieshave been able to build up reserves and provide for depreciation on an adequate scale against the time when  theindustry will have to operate without aid from the Exchequer.   5.   The acreage planted with sugar beet has increaseduntil last year it reached the record figure of 348,469  acres.There are 18 factories in operation:.  the tonnago of beetshandled for the 195.0-31 campaign will be approximately3,000,000 tons, the sugt-r produced will be approximately418,500 tons and will represent as much as 25 per cent,  ofour annual consumption. . In 193o, there were no less than40,400 growers, a largo proportion being smallholders.   Apartfrom regular farm-workers, the crop gives employment to30,000 casual workers for more than 3 months in the year.   Inthe factories about 8,500 men are employed in the manufacturingcampaign which lasts from three to four months of the winterseason, 2,500 being employed all the year round.  Muchsubsidiary employment is also created in the transport ofbeet and by-products, in the collieries and the limestonequarries and In the jute and chemical industries.   6.   The average price received by growers for sugar  beethas ranged from a maximum of 59s. 7d. per ton in 1926 to aminimum of about 50s. Od. per ton estimated for 1930.  the comparative stability of the price in tho face of the rapidfall of corn prices and the fact thst the crop can bepromptly cashed have been of material assistance to arablefarmers ana account for the Isrge increase of the areaplanted.   7.   A crisis has, however, been precipitated by the
                                                     -. ..1G3fact that the reduction of subsidy for beet sugar by 6s.6d.per cwt. In 1931 coincides with a further unfore seen fallin the price of sugar, which had already fallen heavily from21s.Od. per cwt. (ex. duty) in 1924 to 9s.Od. per cwt.(ex.duty-) in 1929.   The price Is now around 7s.Qd. per cwt.(ex.duty).   The fall comes when neither growers norfactories have, as a whole, had time to attain maximum efficiency.   8.     Hitherto, the Beet Sugar Factories Committee havenegotiated with the National Farmers * Union the price atwhich  they have been prepared to contract with growers forsugaix  beet,  the price being agreed for periods  corresponding to  the  subsidy  3tages.   A new price is,  therefore, due  to be concluded.   In making  these contracts,  the factories have borne  the risk  of  the fall In sugar prices, and  they have borne  the full  amount of  the fall In price  from  17s.Id. to7s.Od.  per  cwt. of sugar  which has taken place  since  thelast  3-year  beet price  contract was negotiated  with theNational Farmers&apos;  Union.    9.     The  factories have now declined to negotiate .a price for  more  than one year  at  a time,  and althoughnegotiations have  boen  carried  on  with the National Farmers&apos;Union for several  months,  the parties  are not In sight ofagreement.   10.     Certain of the  factory covnpa.nI.os,  I.e.  theAnglo-Scottish (6  factories),  the  Tate and Lyle group (4  factories)  and the Lincolnshire  group (2  factories) on 13th January decided to work without  profit  in the nextmanufacturing  campaign  and to  forego  provision for renewals and reserves,  other than such allowance  for  depreciation as would prudently be made in a normal campaign.   They offered                          \,3.
the national Farmers&apos; Union a price of 37s.6a. per ton ofbeet (17-1 sugar basic), but the offer was declined.  11.     On 16th January, the remaining 5 factories(Anglo-Dutch group) offered the National Farmers1 Union  to operate their factories, not for  the purpose  of makingprofits cr increasing reserves, but to utilise the whole cfthe nat proceeds,  after provision for depreciation,  in pay*-mant to farmers for boots  delivered.   The value  of  this offer necessarily  depends  (1) upon the price  of  sugar next season and 1.2) upon  the extent to which  farmers  deliverbeets up  to tho full  capacity of  thy  factories.   This offerhas also  been declined.   12.     There  sro  two main factors  in  the  situation..   one is  the price at which farmers  can grow the  crop;   the  otheris  the price which tho  factories  can  afford to pay for  it.   13.     The National Farmers&apos; Union on 13th January  informed the  larger  group  of factories  -  and also the pilots * that theycould  not recommend growers  to  contract  at less  than 48s.Od.per ton  for beet  (17%.% basis).   An investigation carried outby Cambridge  University in 1929 into  the coats of sugar beetgrowing  suggests  that the more  efficient farmers on better land should be  able to grow beet, without profit or Interest, at 41s.3d.  per  ton (17-l.i basis).   14.      Throughout the period cf the  beet sugar subsidy,my Department has obtained complete manufacturing costings, year- by  year,  from all the factories, and after exhaustive analysis, it has come to the^conclusion that while 9 of themore efficient  factories representing about two-thirds  of tho output could- afl&amp;ar providing  for depreciation on a more modest scale than usual, and working, on the average,  with- ^L.P1\^AL but to      capacity - afford to offer the growers  as much as 39s.4d. per ton for beet  (17^;S), the factories as a whole could not afford to offer more than 37a.7d.   on this basis.   As stated above, 12 of them                        4.
(including only 4 of the more efficient) have, in fact,offered 37s .6d,,     15e  The margin of difference in manufacturing costsbetween tne more and the less efficient factories is large;in 1929-30, the manufacturing costs of the 9 more efficientaveraged 16s,4d. per ton, as against ?3s.l0d. per ton for theless efficient.  It therefore seems certain that several ofthe less efficient will not be able to pay the offerer? price of37s06dt per ton for beet without incurring losses.     16o  Taking into account the depressed price of cereals,and after much encu iry from t.:ie factories, it is the view ofmy advisers that, in large areas, a minimum beet price of43/- to 44/- per ton (lY-g-Jv) should succeed in inducing growersto plant a substantial proportion of the 1950 acreage.     17.  In any case, however, the sharp fall in price (from about 50/- per ton of beet in 1930) and the lack of preparation resulting from tr-e uncertainty of the situation,is bound to result In a considerable reduction of the areaplanted in 1951.  It is important to bear this in mind, sincethe factories /rust work to full capacity for maximum efficiency.     18.  The need for agreement between factories and no?ower is urgent.   Every few days 1 delay now means a reduction of thearea to be planted and the less efficient cultivation of sucharea as will be planted.  Growers must take a definite decision in the matter in the course of the next week or two,     19c  The position is particularly serious because, as Ihave already indicated, it is in the corn-growing areas that have already been disastrously hit by the world slump in comprices, that sugar beet is most widely grown.  If we canassist the sugar beet growers at this crisis we shall do something immediate and practical, towards implementing the pledge given in the house of Commons last August by the
f 0 9-A. ij/Chancellor of the Exchequer:-          &quot;as soon as the conclusions of the Imperial     Conference are known, the Government will undertake     whatever practicable steps can be devised to put     cereal growing in this country on an economic     foundation&quot;*     20.  It may not be possible to introduce during the present session the proposals that I have put forward for a Home v&apos;heatQuota.   It is, however, possible to alleviate the positionof wheat growers, by assisting them through the medium ofthe sugar beet crop.     21.  The factories have asked me to recommend a completeremission of the Excise duty on sugar (5s.l0d. per cwt - 15s.9d.per ton of beet) which would ;enable&apos; them to operate on a profit basis, but I am not prepared to entertain this proposal.The gap which has to be filled Is In the neighbourhood of 6o.0d.per ton of beet, being the difference between the price (37s.6d.per ton) that the average factory can offer on a non-profitearning basis and the price at which growers can be expected to contract (43s*6d. per ton) earning a very slender profit, and,in many cases, none at all,   This gap can be filled by lesseningfor one year the imminent fall in the subsidy from 13s. to8s.-6d. instead of to 6s.6d., per cwt of sugar.   The extra 2so0d.subsidy thus required is equivalent to about 5s.9d, per ton of beet and tho industry should find whatever extra is requiredto secure the growers&apos; contracts.   An amendment of the british sugar  (Subsidy) Act would, of course, be necessary-.     22,  I, therefore, desire the approval  of my colleagues to an  immediate announcement  of the Governments intention to grant
 grant this  measure of relief.    I am of opinion that  as Government  and Parliament,  in 1924-5,  deliberately set  out,  at great public  expense,&apos; to nurse the sugar beet  Industry  up to 1935-4,  it  is  our very definite duty,  alike to the public and bo the industry,  to take action in the present emergency, when the shocks  cf shifting price levels have upset all calculations, to enable the establishment of the industry to proceed  without fatal interruption.      23,   I would attach the following conditions      (a)   that the factories pass on to the growers the full           equivalent of the extra subsidy as an addition to  the           offer of 37s.6d.  per ton of beet already made;      (b)   that, in accordance with a plan to be agreed  with  the           Treasury after consultation with the industry, the           extra subsidy shall only be payable so long as, and           to the extent that, sugar prices fail to improve from.           7/- by the amount of the suggested, increase In subsidy,           viz. 2s.Od. per cwt.      24.   I would endeavour also, if possible, to use the present opportunity to press some measure of rationalisation on the Industry, but as time is the essence of the contract I  cannot be certain of achieving results.      25.   The cost of this assistance in the financial  year  1931 should not exceed  600,000 and, in all probability, will be considerably less.  I have very grave doubts whether It will be adequate to secure a full acreage or the operation of all the factories,  but, in the present financial stringency, I  do not feel that we ought to offer more.
