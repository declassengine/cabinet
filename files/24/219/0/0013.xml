HATIQUALITY OF WOMEH BILL.                  MemorandUui by the Home Secretary.      My colleagues will remember that in  November last  I circulated a memorandum (0.P.386(30))  suggesting  the  line which should be taken by the Government Spokesman  during the Second Reading Debate on the Bill introduced by the  late Dr. Bentham, and that the Cabinet at their meeting on the  26th IT ov ember (Cabinet Conclusions 70(30&apos;)) approved the  course  recommended in  my memorandum.      I accordingly explained in the course  of  the debate that His Majesty&apos;s Government had  already publicly  expressed their sympathy with the principles of the Bill;  that the recent Imperial Conference had emphatically reaffirmed the existing doctrine that any changes  in the requirements for the common status (which of course includes any change  affecting the nationality of women) should be introduced only after consultation and agreement amongst the  several members  of the  Commonwealth, and had felt themselves unable,  owing to the lack of  agreement, to make any recommendation for  the substantive  amendment of the law relating to nationality which wont bej^ond  the principles of the Convention agreed at tho Hague in April last?   and that  in these circumstances we in this country should, if  Parliament were to pass this Bill, be open to the accusation&quot; that, immediately after the Conference, .,we had taken the first&apos; opportunity of committing a clear breach of faith with our Dominions.  I  pointed  out, however, that the Government did not propose to pursue a policy of inaction but were prepared, at the  earliest opportunity, to promote legislation to give effect to the Articles of the Hague  Convention which represent the extent to which agreement hao been reached in this field among the various members of the  Commonwealth.  I also
informed, the  House  that,  in addition to the proposed alterations of nationality law,  the  Government  had under consideration aproposal to alter our  domestic law  so as to enable a British bornwoman,  who becomes  an  alien by reason of marriage, to remainentitled,  while she  is in the United Kingdom,  to all the rightsand privileges she  would enjoy if she were otill a British subject.I also  said that if  a  Second Reading were given to the Bill Ishould  regard it as  demonstration in favour of a principle whichis acceptable to all.     The Bill obtained a Second Reading without a Division andis now  awaiting consideration in Committee.  The Women&apos;organisations are anxious as to the fate of the Bill and some ofthem are pressing the  Government to give facilities for itsremaining stages.  It  therefore becomes necessary for the Cabinetto decide what course  of action should be followed.     For the reasons  explained in my previous memorandum, and stated  by me during the Second Reading debate, I think my colleagues will agree that, quite apart from considerations of parliamentary time, the Government could not give any facilities for this Bill.Indeed, if the Bill shows any signs of making progress it will benecessary for the Government, in view of the constitutional issues involved, to consider  seriously the question of taking steps tosecure  that the Bill is so amended as not to exceed the limits ofthe agreement embodied in the Hague Convention.  On the other hand,it is quite certain that there is no hope of the promoters agreeing to such a limitation of the Bill, and any steps taken by theGovernment to amend the Bill in this sense would be stronglyresented by the Women&apos;s Organisations.&quot;      In these circumstances it becomes necessary for the Governmentto frame a policy which will safeguard the existing constitutional position, while at the same time giving an earnest of the sincerity of our  desire to give effect, as soon as agreement among the membersof the  Commonwealth can be reached, to the principles embodied in the  Bill promoted by the Women&apos;s Organisations.
                                                               i r1 f&apos;      I suggest, therefore, for the consideration of my colleagues,that the Government should decide to prepare and to announce its intention of introducing at some future date a Bill containing the provisions outlined in the Appendix attached to this memorandum.      It will be observed that my proposal is that the Bill should consist of different parts.  One Part would include provisions on the lines of the Bill promoted by the Women&apos;s Organisations,but subject to a proviso that this part should not be operativeunless brought into force by Order in Council  (which would be made if and when the Dominions were prepared to come into line).  Otherparts would give immediate legislative effect to the relevantArticles of the Hague Convention, and to certain other amendments of nationality law, which, having been recommended by the imperial conferences of 1923 and 1926, were embodied in a draft Bill In 1927.The remaining part of the Bill would give effect to the proposal which,  as I stated in the House, the Government has underconsideration for restoring to her, while in this country, thepolitical and other rights and privileges which a British bornwoman loses under the existing law on her marriage with an alien.      The announcement of the Government&apos;s intention to introduce a Bill  on these lines would strengthen the Government&apos;s positionin resisting the demand for facilities for the Private iiember&apos;bill now before the House.      If the Women&apos;s Organisations -wore satisfied with such anannouncement we should avoid the difficulty of having to decide between (l) insisting on amendments to the Bill introduced by thelate Dr. Bentham, which its supporters would strongly resent, and(2) allowing the Bill to pass into lay/ in its present form, thuscausing a breach in the basis upon which rests the common statuspossessed by all subjects of Plis iaajesty - a breach which successiveImperial Conferences have repeatedly declared is not to becontemplated.      If on the other hand the Women&apos;s Organisations expresseddissatisfaction with the Government&apos;s proposals,  we should have the
                                                                 1 t? f*  convincing reply that., within  the framework  of the existing con-i t 0  stitution, the Government have done  their utmost to  effect those  changes  in the law which they, no leas  than  the Women&apos;s  Organisations desire.       For the convenience of my colleagues,  the policy which  I  suggest  for their consideration may  be  summarised as follows        (l)  That we should prepare a  Government Bill  on the following  lines           (a) Part I would  contain Glauses giving effect  to the       demands made by  the Women&apos;s Organisations, but in  view  of       the constitutional issues involved, this Part  would not come       into operation until  it  is brought into force  by Order  in       Council which would not  be made until  the Dominions come       into line.           (b) Part II  would give effect to the Articles  embodied  in       the  Hague Convention which have  already been  agreed to by       the Dominions.           (c) Part III would give effect to  other minor  amendments       of the law relating to nationality which have  already been       approved at previous  Imperial  Conferences.           (d) Part IV  would alter the domestic law of the United       Kingdom so as to restore to a  British  born woman while  In       this country the political and other privileges which under       the existing law she  loses on  marriage to an alien.        (2)  That we should at a suitable opportunity  announce  the  Government&apos;s intention to introduce  such a Bill as soon  as  circumstances permit.       I  should be glad if the  Cabinet would  consider these proposals  as  to our future policy in  relation  to  the question  of the  nationality of women and would authorise me  to announce  our policy  at  a  suitable opportunity.

4 yry                    APPENDIX.  (a) Part I of the Bill will provide;      (i) that a woman being a British subject who marries an alien          shall not by reason of her marriage cease to be a British          subject unless she makes a declaration of alienage,          within (say) one year of her marriage:0te:-  The question whether there should be a time limit requires          further consideration).     (ii)that it shall be lawful for a  woman who was a British         subject before her marriage to an alien and who  at the time         of the coming into force of this Act is deemed to be an alien         by reason of her marriage  to an alien  to make a  declaration         that she desires to resume British nationality,  within (say)         one year after the Act comes into force:ote:-  It is for consideration whether a time limit - should not be          fixed for the declaration of desire to retain British          nationality under section 10 of the Act of 1914).   (iii)  that a woman being an alien who marries a British subject          shall not acquire British nationality unless she makes a          declaration of acquisition of British nationality,          within (say) one year of her marriage:ote:-  The quest j. on whether there should be a time limit requires          further consideration).    (iv)  that it shall be lawful for a woman who was an alien          before her marriage to a British subject and who at the          time of the coming into force of this Act is deemed to be          a British subject by reason of her marriage to make a          declaration of alienage, within (say) one year after this          Act comes into force:    (v)    that &quot;the expression &quot;disability&quot; in section 27 of the          Act of 1914 shall no longer mean &quot;the status of being a          married woman&quot;.        It should be provided that this part of the Bill  shall not  come into force until an Order in Council is made, but an Order  in Council may bring it in force in whole or in part.
1 70X L O   (b) Part  II  will  give  effect  to Articles  8-10  of  the Hague        I      Conference.   This  might be  done  by  provisions on the      following lines:-       (i) a woman being  a British subject shall  not cease to be  a          British subject on her  marriage to  an  alien unless she          acquires  the nationality of  her husband under  the law          of the foreign state  of which her husband is a national:      (ii) a woman being  the wife  of a  British subject who ceases          to be a British subject under the provisions of section          13 of the Act  of 1914 shall  not herself thereby cease  to          be a British subject  unless  and until  (a) she  acquires          the  new nationality of  her husband  under  the law  of  the          foreign state  in which  he has become naturalised, and          (b)  she makes  a declaration  of  alienage;(Note  that until our law  is altered so  as  to provide that a  married      woman  is  not under  disability for purposes  of  naturalization      special provision will be  required to meet  the case of e.g.      the naturalization  of the  husband as an  American  citizen  after      his marriage.   The  wife in that event will  not cease to be  a      British subject (under (i))  and can  only become an  American      citizen by subsequent naturalization).     (iii)&apos;where an  alien obtains  a certificate of naturalization          his wife  shall not acquire the  status  of  a natural born          British subject unless  her name is  included  on her own          application in the certificate  granted to her  husband.    (c)  Part III of  the Bill will  provide:        that a woman who  was a British  subject before her marriage        to an alien  shall be entitled while in the United Kingdom        to all  political  and other rights, powers and privileges,        and  be subject to all obligations, duties and liabilities        to which she would have  been entitled  or  subject  if  she had        not  married  an alien.    (d)  Part IV of the Bill will reproduce the clauses  of the        draft Bill of August 9th,  1927  (to amend  the British        Nationality  and Status  of  Aliens Acts, 1914-1929).
