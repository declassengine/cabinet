Works etc,         Herewith is the party&apos;s statement of policy in reference to Coal Mines which I promised to circulate.These proposals were prepared by a Committee representing theTrade Union Congress, the Labour Party Executive, theParliamentary Labour Party Executive^the Miners Federation,and were accepted by the Margate Conference (October 1926)as our policy for dealing with this difficult nuestion.         Since 1926 the Electricity Act has come into operation,and, as a consequence, we have modified some of our views as tothe best methods to be adopted in order to secure progress towards social ownership and control of industry.  All thesame, the main principles embodied in these proposals forapplying common sense to the mining industry still hold thefield, because they lay down quite clearly that any satisfactory-national scheme must secure national ownership and control,and obtain for the workers in the industry, and the nation, afair deal by so unifying the industry as to secure that coal-getting, coal utilisation in all its branches, and coaldistribution shall be carried on as a unified social service.The full and complete national development of electricity, thefull and complete utilisation of coal in all directions, willbe more effectively secured once the industry is unified.         Long before June, the Board of Trade and the cabinet will be faced with the question of what is to happen when the eight Hours Act lapses.  The owners only admit the possibilityof a seven hours day if sucha reduction of hours Is accompaniedby a most drastic cut in wages.  It is impossible to think that                                                         our
our party vrill &quot;be able, tacitly or actively, ^o agree to such aoondition of affairs.         y;e should, therefore, he using the breathing space whichtemporary arrangements may give us, in a supreme effort to c?o forthis industry what iiir Douglas Hogg did for electricity, excent thatwe shall fill up gaps in his  scheme and secure that  the industry is organised, as a complete service.  There are nor? difficulties indealing fundamentally with coal, hut these  are not greater than thosewhich v.re meet in our continual endeavours to patch up and makeworkable a system which has been roundly condemned toy everyinvestigation during the past 25 years, and, after all  the patching,nobody is satisfied.   It &quot;way  be argued that we should allow  our ownAct to have a chance.  It is, however, clear that without ^ore, muchmore,  compulsion, we are not  going  to get very far,  and whateverprogress  is made, will only be made at the  expense  of the  standardof  life  of the workers.  In addition, it  is not  possible  for me  tobelieve  that  -without the aid  which complete unification of theentire industry  will give, wages  can be maintained:,   Also,  ifInternational negotiations and  agreements  are  to mean  anything,there  must be a  National  Central  Authority  able  to aoeak  for thewhole  British Coalfield.          &quot;,&quot;e  exist as a party, to  use our  political power  for thepurpose  of peaceohly transforming competitive commercialism intosocial service.   All business men with any vision,  and all truepatriots, realise that great  changes, tooth in methods of productionand in distribution of the results of industry,  must take place.I have talked with Editors,  Bankers and others about mining and all agree that a unified industry,  organised on public utility lines, is what Is needed.  I therefore ask my colleagues to consider and determine whether tho time has not arrived when we  should approach the Liberals with a scheme on these lines, anc ask  for their support,          I may also mention  the fact that  years ago certain organs                                                             of
of the Press advocated such a scheme, and the late Lord Rhonddawas a great advocate of unification in South Wales.  It is true thata complete scheme will put some miners out of work, but this happensin many industries we are assisting to rationalise, and is part of theprice we must pay to get industry properly organised.  The problem ofdealing with the surplus is one to be met when it arises.It is, however, certain that if one or other of the schemes forgetting petrol and other oils from coed should materialise, as islikely, a great national scheme for co-ordinating the Industry into aco-operative whole, would find work  for many men,  displaced asminers.   It cannot be  too often repeated  that we  are living in days when  scientific discovery and mechanical  development -will  not standstill, and our object  is two-fold, namely,  to secure regular eraploy-raent  under increasingly  improved  conditions, and  a better  social service for the community,  and our proposals for  dealing with  coalif adopted, will  achieve these ends.  We  cannot deal with  all industries at  once.   It  is  possible  to  dead with  coal,,  however,because public opinion is against the present wasteful  system  ofstrife and patched pea.ee, which perpetuates  a state of  chronicwarfare,  with  all the  evils,  economic and moral,  which  accompany  war.          In asking my  colleagues  to  re-examine  our former  proposals and bring them into  line with present day conditions,  I am not un-   *mindful  of  the tremendous difficulties  connected,  with Parliamentary       -time, and finance, &quot;which must be  faced.   We must  remember, however,that  the  situation  to  be faced in June  will, whether we like  it  ornot,  occupy a  good  deal  of  Parliamentary time.   If it  is possible toget  agreement  with the Liberals  on a truly comprehensive scheme,  It is probable  that  we  should  save  time, but whether this  is so  or  not, we ought to be in a position to  say what is our own policy,  and  not be driven into adopting once again a policy which our  spokesmen  in both Houses  are  compelled to declare Is only a policy  forced upon us by Parliamentary conditions.  We cannot expect the miners, who placed                                                            their
their faith in us, to accept as inevitable, a policy which, formany of them, is serai-starvation, and as to finance, the financial proposals in our scheme, with some modifications, will stand., andshould cost the Treasury nothing at all.

FOREWORD.HE country is faced  with the  task  of  determining the future ofthe industry which is the lifeblood  of  every other  importantBritish industry.   The evidence  given  before the  Coal  Commission  by  the  mine-owners has,  we  believe, convinced  a large section of the  public  thatit is futile  to expect a bold lead from those who at present control thecoal industry.  The choice which is offered  to the miners  and to thecommunity is between the contraction of the industry by closing moreand more  pits and throwing more miners  permanently into the ranks of  the unemployed  on  the  one hand,  and on the other lower  wagesand longer hours for the miners.   The miners and, we venture to  think,  the  whole  Labour  move-ment will resist either  policy.  We  do not believe for one moment that the coal industry is a sinking ship  which must lighten its burdenby throwing  part of  the  cargo overboard.  Nor, again, do we believe thatthe way to industrial prosperity is to be found by marching backwardsto  conditions of employment which have been universally condemned.   The real hope for the future is the  unification of the coal industry under  national ownership and the scientific  treatment of  coal.    Weare glad  to think  that the whole Labour movement is united with theMiners&apos; Federation of Great Britain in support of this  great constructivescheme which  will  bring prosperity  to  the miner  and  enrich thecommunity.H.  SMITH, President,A.  J.  COOK, Secretary,Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain.
PART  I.THE  FUTURE  OF  THE   COAL  AND  POWER  INDUSTRY       The necessity  for unification within the coal industry itself has long been urged by the miners  and by the whole Labour Movement.  although this  is  essential  to  the efficient working&apos; of the  industry,  more  drastic changes are needed if the industry is to become  really prosperous and ableto employ at a reasonably high level of wages the large number it  hasemployed hitherto.       Several witnesses before the Coal Commission expressed the doubtsmany people feel in regard to the export trade.   Owing to causes  beyondthe control of anyone connected with the coal industry  in  this country,  itwould appear that with the increasing industrialisation of foreign countrieswhich have hitherto bought coal from  us there is  proceeding the increasedutilisation of the coal, oil,  and water  power resources in those countries.There appears  in many cases  to  be  a  definite and  probably permanentdecrease in the  amount  of  coal they require to  import,  and thus it comesabout that while, until recently, we have maintained our share of the world markets, the absolute amount of our coal  exports has greatly decreased.       It is of course impossible to forecast with  accuracy the future  ofdie coal export  trade, but taking into account  the developments in othercountries  to which  we have referred, and also the likelihood of increasingcompetition from the  United  States,  which can  for  geological   reasonsproduce coal at a lower cost than any other country, it would be very unsafeto rely on a restoration of the pre-war volume of coal exports.  The  british coal  industry is  not likely to reach that level of exports, though the factmust be  emphasised that, if conducted  and  organised on efficient andtechnically progressive lines, it will be in a much  stronger position to  dispose of its output than it is to-day.      Apart from  any  question of  its importance to  the coal industry,export coal  is a factor  of  considerable importance to industry in  generaland  to  the nation as  a whole,  by  reason of  its high  position  in  the list of our exports and its effect in reducing  freight rates on imported food-stuff s and produce.   If it is necessary in the national interest, however, tomaintain a certain level  of coal exports, this fact  constitutes an additionalargument  for organising the industry on the most economical lines.      Labour is convinced, however, that the mining industry can performa  greater service to the nation in other ways, at the same time being economic-ally  independent and becoming, despite the possible loss of part  of our export trade in  coal, an efficient,  prosperous industry,  giving continuousemployment in all probability to as many persons as it has done hithertoand at reasonably high rates of wages.(A) From Coal Digging to Coal  Treatment.        This desirable  transformation can best be accomplished  by  the transformation of the  industry itself.  From being a coal-extracting industry-it should become increasingly  a coal utilising industry.      The fact that in the past  this basic  industry of coal production hassold its raw product to other industries to be utilised has led to a progressivepressure being exercised with  the object of reducing prices.
       The  shipper demands  cheap ships, the  shipbuilder passes this onin the demand for cheap iron and steel, and the iron and steel manufacturerpasses this  on again in the demand for cheap coal;  but the coal industrycannot  continue the process.   It feels  the pressure from  every industry,and  labour  cost being  necessarily such a large part of the cost of produc-tion, there is an insistent demand for a reduction in the workers&apos; standards.       Much  could and should be done by the introduction  of  as efficientmethods, organisation, and machinery as possible, to  combine  low  labour costs with  high wages and good conditions, but  for  the  reasons  already stated it becomes  necessary to adopt other  changes also in the characterof the industry itself.       The introduction of, and improvements in, methods  of  generating,transmitting,  and employing electricity  as  a motive power and  a means of lighting and  heating  have revolutionised  the  power  problem.  electric power is now recognised to be, in a well-organised community, an increasinglyefficient and  economical source  of  power,  light  and  heat  for industrial and domestic purposes.        The wide  range of by-products obtained from the pre-treatment ofcoal has also provided the basis for a number of highly important industries.         The utilisation of  coal in the production  of electricity, gas,  coke,and by-products has not, generally speaking, been undertaken  by the coalcompanies.  It is true that many collieries generate electrical power, butin most cases  this  is  entirely for  their  own use.  It  is also  tmethat many collieries have  as ancillary  undertakings  coke ovens and by-product works, but these are  in the main the  property of concerns havingiron and steel interests for which a supply of metallurgical coke is required.Moreover,  these  ancillary  undertakings  have  not been regarded  by the owners  as forming part of the coal industry, though the Miners&apos; Federation have repeatedly pressed for their inclusion. (B) The Importance of Electrical Power.        It seems certain that the importance of  electrical power supply must become greater and greater as time  goes on.  Evidence was laid before the Coal  Commission  by Mr. C.   H.   Merz  and  other  witnesses  showing that Britain  is falling behind other  countries in respect of economical and efficient generation and transmission of electric power.  The nations usualh instanced  as  commercial and industrial rivals, viz., Germany,  France, and America, are already much better equipped in this  respect and rapid progress is still being made.         In  view  of   the   already  considerable  publicity  that  has  beei given  to  this matter there  is no need to  traverse  in  detail  the  groum that  has  already been covered by  other  authorities in  regard  to thi matter.*   It  is  perhaps  sufficient  to  say  that  most experts  appear  t be agreed that  we  have  a  great deal  of  leeway  to make  up and tha  a large national  scheme  of  power  supply and distribution  is  urgent! needed  in  order to  give  industry  in   particular  and  the  communit  in  general a plentiful and  relatively  cheap supply of electrical power. Th      *Full information and statistics on these matters will he found in mlpublications as  &quot;Electrical Power and National Progress,&quot; the proceedings;the Coal Commission, and in many of the technical papers read at the Wor.Power Conference in 1924,  especially those  contained  in  Volume  IV. of tl&quot; Transactions of the World Power Conference.&quot;
importance  of  rural  electrification for the  salvation  of the  languishingindustry of agriculture is&quot; also being urged, and many transport authorities are equally emphatic in advocating the electrification  of railways both for itsown  sake  and  because rural  electrification would  otherwise  appear  to be impracticable.       The  increasing  use  of  electricity  for  industrial  and   domestic purposes  need  not,  and  in all probability will  not,  lead to a  reductionin  the demand  for  coal.   Mr.  0.  H.  Merz has  pointed  out  that  inview of the experience of  other countries and  the  inherent probabilities ofthe case the supply on a large scale  of cheap  electric  power will act as  v-stimulus to industry, will create a far bigger demand for electricity, and so will lead to as great a demand for coal in the home market as there has beenhitherto.        Even  if  part  of our foreign  markets  is  lost  owing to the causes already  mentioned,  the coal industry should still be able to play its part by providing cheaper power, and so  enabling manufactured goods tobe exported in far greater quantities.        In such a development the coal industry would be not an incidentalbut a  vital factor,  and the possibilities in  this direction must  be of thedeepest concern to everyone engaged in the industry.  &quot;The prosperity  of themining industry is inextricably bound up with  the  whole question of  powersupply, and it would be disastrous for the  industry to  allow these development-ments to be carried on as an entirely separate,  independent activity.(C)  Abolishing the Smoke Evil.        The pre-treatment of  coal  is  hardly  less important.    It  is,  infact, bound up with  the development on a large  scale of electrical power.To produce power  or heat by  burning the  raw coal,  as is so often done to-day, is by general consent  of  fuel technicians a grossly wasteful andunhygienic proceeding.       Apart from  the smoke evil, with its  attendant  economic  at. well ashygienic  and  aesthetic  injury  to  the community, there is  the  enormousloss of valuable by-products which can be recovered by the pre-treatmentof  coal.       At  present  the only  form of pre-treatment operated on a  large scale  is that of high  temperature distillation as carried on  by  the gas industry.   Set up  primarily  for  the  purpose  of producing town gas, theindustry  produces  in  addition  large quantities  of valuable  by-productsincluding coke,  ammonium products  (used as  fertilisers), and tars.  Thesetars themselves form  the  basis of important chemical  industries  producingdyes,  explosives, disinfectantsf drugs, etc.       The gas industry uses about 18,000,000 tons of coal a year, and thereis no  reason to &quot;suppose that its  importance will  diminish in future.(D) New Technical Advances.       It  must also  be recognised that there is a very promising  future for low-temperature processes which  are  now  being developed.       On a matter of such technical difficulty, Labour, naturally takes  noBides,  but  even a layman can understand what enormous  possibilities  thereare in these methods.  A layman can also judge  to some  extent on the natureof  the  case  for and  against low temperature carbonisation,  and  it may  be concluded  from the evidence that is contained in official reports, such  as the
Annual Report of the Department of  Scientific  and Industrial Research,from evidence  that has been  placed before the Coal Commission, and frompapers read before the World Power Conference in 1924, especially  those in volume  II. of the Transactions,  which deal with this matter, that no onequestions the technical validity of these processes.       Apparently the only  question at issue is  as to  whether in existingeconomic circumstances  undertakings can operate the  processes profitablyand make them what is called &quot; a commercial success.&quot;       Even on this  basis several  expert witnesses before the commission have testified that low temperature carbonisation is a commercial success.       It can  hardly  be  argued that the position of the gas industry wouldbe really menaced by such a development.       Since large amounts of coke will continue to be needed for metallurgical purposes the high temperature process will continue to be carried on.  the by-products will continue to be enormously valuable,  and the only question ooncerns the disposal of the gas.   Ordinarily the electrical power would  be generated at  or near the mines, largely by the use of &quot; breeze,&quot; a low- grade fuel  by-product  of the  pre-treatment  of  coal  and of  low-grade coal  which  in many mines  is left in the  workings  and not utilised  at all.  But if power so.generated is so cheap that gas for lighting and heating purposes,  both industrially  and  domestically,  will be superseded by elec- tricity,  the  gas will not be  wasted, as it  can be used  economically  for the further  production of electrical power.  Whether gas or electricity is  used  in the factory and in the home will depend largely on the price of equivalent units, and also on convenience. From  the point of view of cleanliness there is little to choose.  The probability is that if electricity is as -cheap as  or cheaper than gas (which may very well  be the case)  it will, be preferred, though  for certain industrial uses gas may continue to  be used. -         In any case, this is a matter of comparatively  small  importance,  as the  gas can be used to  generate  electricity if that proves to  be  the more economical course.         In case gas continues to be used for its present purposes it will pro- bably be part of a large inclusive scheme to  pipe the  gas over considerable distances if necessary.  That this can be done cheaply has been demonstrated in the &quot;United States.         On  the other hand,  it appears that  if  and  when low temperature processes  can be  developed on a big scale  the products it yields will be especially valuable,  including as they do fuel  oils,  which could  to a great extent, and  perhaps entirely, serve as  a substitute for  oil now imported, lubricating oils, rich gas, other by-products, and  a  smokeless fuel  which!  can be burnt in the ordinary grate, thus replacing the wasteful,  dirty,  and&quot;  unhygienic practice  of burning raw coal.          It has  been calculated  (Report of Giant  Power Survey of Penn-   sylvania, p. 109) that  from 50 million tons  of a  typical bituminous coal,   there could be obtained by low  temperature methods:            38 to 40 million tons of smokeless, easily kindled fuel for  domestic                or industrial use;         250 million gallons  of fuel oil (petrol  and petrol substitutes);         250 million gallons  of creosoting and disinfectant oils;         500 million gallons of tar oils, suitable for fuel  oil and as base for th                chemical industry;          75 to 100 thousand million cubic feet of a very rich gas.
      &quot; In combination,&quot;  it is said,  &quot; as a great fuel mining recovery,.utilising and selling agency,  the calculations given .... would indicate thepossibility of obtaining residual fuel for the power plant at a mere  nominalcost, provided all the profits above fixed.charges arising from the combina-tion  coal handling and  treatment were considered as reducing  the cost ofthe residual fuel.&quot;        The  low temperature process results  in  a much  smaller supplyof ammonium products than is  given  by the high  temperature process.  Ifthe supply  of these products  is insufficient for national needs,  it will be avery simple matter to utilise some of the cheap  power produced  for themanufacture of  synthetic ammonia by the nitrogen fixation  process.  Forthis process hydrogen is  extracted from coal-gas and nitrogen from the air,and at present the  chief obstacle to its development in this country is the lack of cheap electrical power.      Technical experts state  that   in  operating the low  temperatureprocess, small and inferior  coal can be used  which is now in very manycases wasted.      The opinion is also expressed in the Eeport of the Giant Power Surveythat   such   a process   can  be operated most  successfully  (from  thecommercial point of  view)  in conjunction with  a scheme  for generatingelectrical power  on a large  scale.       Such  large scale  schemes have been recommended by distinguishedengineers in Pennsylvania and Illinois, U.S.A., in the former case after  aGovernment  inquiry.      Although a layman can hardly  pronounce on all the technical aspectsof this matter, it appears certain that low temperature processes will very soon be, if they are  not now,  ripe  for  large-scale  development.  these methods  are  therefore   referred   to   in  succeeding   paragraphs   on  theassumption  that they are capable  of  being so operated, but the fact mustbe emphasised that the  scheme Labour proposes for the coal industry doesnot in the  least depend on  such  developments.   The scheme stands by itself, though it  will fit  in admirably  with these new technical, processes if and when they  are worked.       The  Labour Movement  holds  that the questions dealt  with in thepreceding  paragraphs may  be regarded as interdependent.       An abundant supply  of cheaper electrical power;  the pre-treatment ofcoal  so  as  to produce coke and smokeless fuel,  gas,  oils, fertilisers,  tarsand  chemical base materials; the  stabilisation of the coal  industry; theelectrification of the rural areas; the  electrification  of the  railways; allmay be regarded as bound up  with  each other  and can be  realised mosteconomically and efficiently in conjunction with  each other.        Electrical power generation cannot be considered  apart from theother factors.   Even if  our water power resources were developed to theutmost possible  extent, in comparison  with our power requirements they areinsignificant.  For this country, clearly, coal  will remain the great source of power.      The problems  of  electricity  and coal cannot therefore  be separated,and they ought to be considered as one organic question to be dealt with  inone comprehensive  scheme.        The generation and transmission of electric power on a large scale,or, in other  words, on  the only  efficient and  economical scale,  involves the conception  of  a  &quot; pool &quot; of power,  from  which the  entire  com-munity may draw  its supplies.  Technical experts agree that  such power
zones are essential to efficiency and economy.  It is clear that only a schemeof a national character can meet such a need.  A multiplicity of small under-takings,  as at present, necessarily means waste, inefficiency, high costs, and high  prices,  with  consequent  low   power  consumption and  industrialstagnation.       A small number of  privately  owned  trusts  would mean a  certainamount  of economy and a stimulation of power consumption,  but it wouldbe by its very nature  a menace to the welfare of the community  that  no government, having the interests of  the people  in  general at heart, could possibly tolerate.(E) A Nationally  Owned Industry.         The alternative is a nationally owned scheme which would eliminatewaste, work at the highest efficiency, reduce  costs and prices, and result inhigh power  consumption, industrially and domestically, with a great stimulus to industrial activity and prosperity.        What is  proposed,  therefore,  in  the interests  of  the  nation  as awhole, in the interests of British industry, and in the interests of the coaiindustry, is the  &quot; integration &quot; (to use the  term commonly  employed  for^uch organisation), or, in other words, the linking-up into  one organic wholeof the power and coal industries of the country.        Labour suggests that the coal industry should become an organisationtoi?  mining coal,  manufacturing  electrical  power  on  a  very large scale,making both coke  and smokeless fuel, and producing, in addition, gas, fueloils,  ammonium compounds, chemical base materials from tars, and  other by-products.        This transformed industry should  be nationally  owned.         Such  a  scheme,  the  details of  which follow,  though  perhaps ambitious,   is not more so than  the one  recommended  by a Government Commission for Pennsylvania.         Viewed as  a nationally owned and controlled industrial project it is no bigger than the United States Governments construction and operation of the Panama Canal and its subsidiary works, or  than the Canadian  Govern- ment&apos;s ownership and control of the whole system  of National Railways, Steamships, etc. ; both these  projects are highly successful.         The details  of  the  proposals  follow, and criticisms  are  anticipated and answered.   It  is  believed that  after giving due  consideration to the scheme suggested the public  will  appreciate  the advantages of such  a development.         The proposals  are advanced  in the belief that  by means of such a  scheme British industry in general  and the coal industry in particular will  receive a  new impetus.         It  is confidently asserted that  the scheme is  practicable,  efficient,  technically srand, and economically necessary.
.rj9 t w                             PART  II.  THE  LABOUR   PLAN   FOR   REORGANISING   AND    DEVELOPING THE COAL AND  POWER  INDUSTRY.(A)  The Case for Public Ownership.      The  defects in the existing organisation of the industry need not beelaborated.  The following points seem to us to be established:          (a)  The private ownership  of coal by more  than  3,000 owners    results  in the  loss  of considerable quantities of coal  and impedes  the    most efficient lay-out of the coalfields.        (b) The ownership and operation of about 3,000 pits by more than-    1,000 separate concerns is  not favourable to  economical working.  This    makes it difficult or impossible  to secure the economies which could be    obtained by the collective purchase  of  materials  and  the  collective    sale of  the product, increases overhead charges, and has  in some areas    resulted in  coal  being left unworked through water.        (c) The  system  under  which  coal  is  at   present  distributed    is  uneconomical.   The  separate  ownership   of  wagons  and  the    unnecessarily  large number of middlemen increases the cost  to  the    consumer.        (d) There is reason to believe that the system under which British    coal is  at present sold abroad is less favourable to  the development of    the industry than would  be the co-ordination of the export trade by  a    single  authority.       It is not suggested that the deficiencies of the  existing system are- mainly due to personal shortcomings on the part of those by whom the  indus- try is1 at present conducted It is evident, indeed,  that in  the course of the last century scientific knowledge,  enterprise, and technical skill have all con- tributed to the development  of the British coal industry.  The question,. however,  is not merely whether individuals have been intelligent and  enter- prising, but whether the system within  which  they  work, and  which, as- individuals, they can alter only with great difficulty, is  such as to  make the  best use of  their  intelligence  and  to  direct their enterprise to  the greatest public advantage.       The conclusion to which we have come is that the first condition- of overcoming the  existing defects in the organisation of  the  industry,  and of its  further development,  is the  unification  of  the  ownership of coal, the ownership and operation of collieries, the distribution of  coal, and the export of coal.  By unification is  meant  a system  under which a single- authority, having acquired the  ownership of the mineral  and the collieries, and of the  coke  and by-product works  carried on in conjunction with them, is in a position to organise the development of the industry  without  regard to the separate interests of particular owners or of particular undertakings- in the industry, with a single  eye  to  securing  an efficient service  for the public and  a proper standard of life for the mine workers.  The  powers necessary to bring into existence and to operate such a  system are too large to be  entrusted to any but a  public body.  We  propose, therefore, that the- ownership  of  the minerals  and the  collieries should  be acquired  by the- State.
       We  think it important that in considering the future of the coalindustry careful attention should be given to the closely connected questionsof power and of the treatment of coal.  The reasons why we emphasise this aspect of the matter are set out in  detail in a separate precis of evidence on the subject which has been laid before the Commission.   Here we need only say that by  general consent Great Britain has considerable leeway  tomake up in the matter of securing a cheap and efficient supply of electrical power, and that the main source  of such power must be coal.  Further, thecoal industry, it is  anticipated, will  increasingly find it expedient to under-take the treatment of coal, and to sell in addition to electric current both gasand smokeless fuel,  as well as other by-products.  For this reason it seemsessential that any system established for the control of a unified coal industry should be such  that at the same time it should be capable of promoting thedevelopment of electrical power  and coal treatment, and of facilitating theorganisation of the  coal industry with due regard to  these objects among others.  We have borne this consideration in mind in drafting the proposals set out below.        It  is often urged that nationalisation means &quot; bureaucracy,&quot; thatit inevitably  involves undue governmental intervention and political inter-ference in the administration of  the industry, and that in practice it wouldenable the producers in the industry to determine for themselves their rates of remuneration.   Such criticisms  cannot, we think,  be  brought  against the general  scheme which we  submit later in this precis.  The  industry would be  conducted by people who know the industry and have practical experience in its working.  It would, indeed, be in  the hands of those who to-day as managing directors, managers, clerical and manual  workers  are concerned in carrying it on.    We  have, further,  endeavoured  to reducegovernmental and political interference to a minimum, and we have provided that wages and prices shall normally be  determined by negotiation between the producers and  the consumers who will be required to  foot the bill.        The  scheme of  organisation which  we  submit  is not to be regarded;as a hard and  fast proposal.  We realise that  it may be necessary to make modifications in it  in order to bring it into active operation.  Moreover, we have not felt it to be either possible or desirable to work out the scheme in all  its details.   Our proposals are rather a general framework which must he filled in,  if and  when the Government decide to nationalise the industry in the light of a closer examination of all the detailed circumstances than we have been able to  make.        The  organisation which we propose is briefly as follows:  C tl Pc hi pr by to: ho to rai aci au dis of-en&apos;the mi utimi:sejattcor(B)  Production.                (i.) THE POWER AND TRANSPORT COMMISSION.        A Power and Transport Commission should be established,  whichjwould take the  place  of  the present Electricity Commission.  This Commission should consist of six full-time  Commissioners  representing expenknowledge on (a) coal, (b) electricity, (c) gas,  (d) transport, (e)  commercia ,-questions, (/) labour  questions, together with a chairman. The Commissioishould be attached to  the Board of Trade, and the President of the  Boarcshould be answerable for its work in  Parliament.        The Power and Transport Commission will have the duty of dealinwith the development  of  power  (including  coal) and  transport.   In thi-connection its functions would be:            (a) To survey the problems  of power and transport development a     regards both needs and possibilities.est.adr.mmisanddepapttioc
        (b) To undertake and administer the interconnection of generating   stations and  the trunk line transmission of power.        (c) To lay down conditions governing power and transport under-   takings, both public and private.        (d) To co-operate with the Department of Industrial and Scientific   Eesearch  in  the promotion of research into power production  and coal   by-products and kindred questions.        (e) To undertake or to  arrange for  the  commercial application of   the results of research into power and transport problems.      In addition to  exercising these functions, the Power and transport commission will  form (as explained below) the final authority  determining the larger questions of policy relating to the coal industry.      It may be convenient to amplify these proposals. At the present timepower production and distribution and the treatment of coal are in  thehands of both public  and private undertakings.  It is not proposed at thepresent juncture  that  these  should necessarily be  nationalised.      New coal  treatment and power production plants will be establishedby the reorganised coal industry, and would, of course, be publicly  owned.      The chief  transport services are privately owned, and  any suggestion for their reorganisation would not be relevant to the present inquiry. It.will,however, be necessary to give the Power and Transport Commission Powersto utilise railway  track for transmission lines  and to require electrification of railways if they think  fit, subject, of course,  to Parliamentary powers being acquired for  this purpose.      It will,  moreover,   be necessary  to  arm  the   Commission  with authority  to  prohibit  the  establishment  of  new   power and  coaldistillation  undertakings,  or  to  permit them,  subject  to  the fulfilment of such conditions as the Commission may require, or to take over existingenterprises  which can be most  economically  worked in  conjunction withthe nationalised  coal industry.  It may also be pointed out that the Corn-mission would be concerned  with hydro-electric schemes as well as  with coalutilisation  schemes.      Broadly   speaking,  it seems  to us  that  the  generation,   trans-mission,  and local  distribution  of  power  should  be   dealt  with  asseparate functions.  So far as the nationalised coal  industry  is concerned itsattention would  be  confined  to  the  generation  of  power.   The  inter-communication  of generating stations  and  the  trunk  line  transmission of power would  be  carried on under the auspices of the Power and transport commission.  Local distribution would be a  matter for Local Authorities.        (ii.j THE NATIONAL  COAL AND POWER PRODUCTION COCNCIL.        A  National  Coal   and  Power  Production  Council  should  beestablished.   This body would consist of an  equal number of executive andadministrative officials and  of miners  and  by-product workers, say  twelvein all, elected by their respective organisations,  largely from the ProvincialCouncils, and, say, two  representatives of the Power and  Transport Corn-mission, together with the Chief Officers of the Central Coal administration and  the Chief Inspector of Mines, in  an  advisory  capacity.       The Council would, be presided over by the Secretary  for Mines or his deputy.        The  Coal and  Power Production  Council  would require to meetnot less than once a fortnight  and would be responsible for the organisa-tion  and conduct of  the industry in much the same  way as a board of
directors  is responsible  for  the conduct of a  company.   The Coal and  power Production Council would, subject to what has already been statedwith  regard to  the  duties  of  the  Power and  Transport Commission andsubject also to  the  consultation with  the  Consumers&apos;  Council referred  tebelow, be  charged with the duty of supervising all the internal  affairs  ofthe industry, of securing the use of the most efficient methods of producingand treating coal, and of seeing that material of the necessary quantity andkind  was provided.  The duties of the Coal and Power Production council would be defined by statute.         As regards total output and kind of output, type of plant for treat-ment, research,  etc., it should act  in  conjunction with the Power andTransport Commission, with  whom  the final  decision in  these matterswould rest.   Capital  expenditure, if  in  excess of a certain  figure,  wouldrequire the sanction of  the  latter body.                        (hi.) PROVINCIAL COUNCILS.         Provincial  Councils should  be  established in  such  areas as theCoal  and  Power  Production Council,  in consultation with the Power andTransport Commission, may  determine.   These Councils  should consistof  a Chairman and Vice-Chairman appointed by  the Coal and Power Produc-tion  Council,  six representatives of the  manual and manipulative workers,six representatives  of the  technical  and administrative workers, togetherwith  the Chief Officers of the area and the  District Inspector  of Mines in an advisory capacity.         The  Councils should  discharge such  functions as  the  Coal and Power Production  Council  may from time to time devolve  upon them.These functions might properly include  the supervision of the conduct and administration  of the industry in the district,  but not capital expenditureexcept below a  sum  to be  determined by the  Coal and Power Production Council.  All other questions of capital expenditure would be matters for the  Coal  and Power Production Council  acting  with the sanction of  the Power and Transport Commission.         The  appointment  of  the  Chief Officers  in the district  should  be made by  the Provincial Council, subject to the approval of  the  Coal and Power Production  Council.                     (iv.) PIT  AND  WORKS  COMMITTEE.         Pit  or  Works Committees  should be established  at each mine, consisting of (a) the manager, under-manager, and  commercial manager; (fe) two members nominated  by the  Provincial Council;  (c)  four members elected by the employes in the mine or  works.          Tnese  Committees  should  meet  at  least  once  a   fortnight, and their functions should be to advise the management as to  (a) safety, health, etc. ; (fc) output  and matters  relating thereto,  e.g., questions of equipment.  The final responsibility  for the conduct of the mines or works would  rest with the manager, subject to the decisions of the  Provincial Council.         (v.) RELATIONS BETWEEN CENTRAL AND LOCAL ADMINISTRATION.          The relations  between the central and local administration of the  industry will, no doubt, need to be adjusted from time to time on the basis  of experience.   The view taken in this scheme  is that,  within  the frame-  work of a national system, there should be as much freedom as possible for
each coalfield, in order to make proper allowance for the different  circum-Btances  prevailing in different areas, and  to  avoid  the disadvantages of atoo stereotyped central direction.   The activities of the Provincial Councils,however, would need to be in harmony with the general policy of the coal and Power Production Council.                     (vi.)  THE CONSUMERS&apos;  COUNCIL.        A  Consumers&apos;  Council should be established,  consisting of  repre-sentatives of employers and workers in the coal and power using industries,Local Authorities, Co-operative Societies,  and the body responsible for theexport trade,  together with a Secretariat, to be maintained out of moneyprovided by  Parliament.  The Consumers&apos; Council would be presided overby the Secretary for Mines or his deputy.        It would  consider  all matters common  to consumers, includingprices, transport rates and methods, and methods of distribution.  It wouldalso advise the  Power and Transport Commission  regarding  changes  in demand and the needs  of coal and power users.        The  Coal  and Power  Production Council  and  the  Consumers&apos;Council would meet from  time  to time  for the negotiation  of prices and wages and the consideration of questions affecting  coal and power supply, as is explained below.        It may be found desirable  to  set up committees of users  of other by-products  to determine prices by negotiation with the Coal and  Power Production Council.             (vii.) THE DETERMINATION OF WAGES AND  PRICES.        Whilst it is hoped that there would be regular consultation between the two Councils on all questions of common interest, the most important problems which will arise will be those relating to wages and prices.  With regard  to wage questions it is proposed that applications ,for modifications in  wages should first come before the Coal  and Power Production Council. This body, however, should not have  power to arrive at any decision.   It should  communicate the fact that  an  application has been received to the Consumers&apos; Council, and a joint session of an. equal  number  of members from each of the two Councils should then be held at which the case should be stated  by the representatives of the  workers concerned.  In the event of  a majority of the representatives  of  the two Councils  in joint  session agreeing that a change should be made, they should have power to effect it.         If, as a result of the joint discussion, no settlement can be reached, the question might then be referred by the two Councils to a specially  con- stituted court with a personnel  and terms of reference agreed  upon by the parties concerned.   Such a court would  report upon the facts of the  case and make  recommendations for  a  settlement  which would, in  general, no doubt, be acceptable as  terms   of settlement or  as a basis  for  further negotiations.         As regards the determination  of  prices, it is proposed  that  this 3hould be  systematised by the  organisation of producers (sellers) and  con- aumers (buyers)  and carried  on with a  full knowledge of pJl  the relevant facts as regards costs of production.         Proposed  price changes should  be  discussed  between the  Produc-  tion Council and the Consumers&apos; Council on the basis of ascertained costs&quot;.
Should  it happen that no compromise is reached,  then the prices in questtion should be determined by the President of the Board of Trade, or by aitindependent  tribunal set up by him.(C)  Internal Distribution.        To develop the productive side  of  the coal industry, and to leavj?as it is  the existing system of distribution, where  it is generally held thailconsiderable  economies are possible, would be unfair to the reorganised coalindustry,  as well as to the consumers of  coal.        It is necessary, in our opinion, to effect at least two changes:  1         (a) The transport of coal in trucks of which nearly one-half belonji     to more  than 1,000 separate companies and individuals,  each of whoril     reserves his own trucks for his own use, should  be brought to an endft     Irrespective of its  ownership, the rolling  stock needed  to move coilf     should be available for  all coal.  The  authority  responsible for thm     conduct  of the industry,  in our scheme the Coal and Power Productioil     Council, should be  given the necessary powers to require this  chang:l     to  be made, and to deal  with analogous questions such  as the  size o:ft     trucks.         (b) It will  be the duty of the Coal and Power Production Couneiljt     through  its Coal Sales Branch, to secure that household coal is disttil     buted to the  consumer  more economically than  at present.   It m     suggested  that the machinery  to  be  used for this purpose  shoukj;     consist,  in  general,  of Local Authorities, which  are in many case;I:     already  large  purchasers of coal  for  gas and  electricity  works,  lorn     schools and other public buildings.  The  Local Authority would ar     through a Coal Distribution Committee, to which might be added repre     sentatives of domestic and industrial producers.(D)  The  Export Trade.        With  a view  to  securing  the  best terms  in  foreign  marketsit is desirable,  in our opinion, that a  single authority should  be  establishetftfor  the purpose of handling the export trade in coal.  It is suggested, therelfore, that the conduct of &quot;the export  trade  should either  be  placed  in tkihands of a Coal Export Commission, consisting of, say, three Commissioner: 1with knowledge of the  coal export trade,  or,  alternatively, that it  shoul; Ibe vested in a Public Utility  Corporation consisting in  the main of exist in;coal exporters,  i.e., a  joint  stock  company operating  under a derinitlimitation of  the rate of dividend  payable and such other regulations as thlState may wish to impose.        The Export Commission (or Corporation as the  case may be)  should Ibe separated  from and independent of the coal industry, but it should forr.part of  the Coal  and Power Consumers&apos;  Council referred to above.  In tkievent of an Export Commission being established the President of the Boar;;of Trade  should be answerable  to  Parliament  for its activities.   If tfclproposal of a Public Utility Corporation were  adopted  the responsibility clthe State would be less direct.        The  export body would  purchase coal from the coal  industry a;lprices negotiated with the coal industry and would carry on foreign trad:in coal.
(E)  The Finance of Nationalisation.                          (i.) THE COLLIERIES.        Various estimates have from time to time been made of the amountof capital invested in the industry.  We need  not discuss these, as it isobvious  that estimates of  the price to be paid for the acquisition of  the collieries- must  be based on actual  market values,  as shown, for example,either by the price of colliery  shares over  a period immediately prior to  theappointment of the present Commission or by the average  annual profits ofthe  coal industry.  The principle on which payment should be based is thatthere should be issued to the vendor such amounts of Government stock as would,  if  sold at current market  prices, produce a sum equal to the cashvalue of his property.  In what precise form such stock should  be issued,whether it should consist  of  a  redeemable  stock carrying a  fixed interestcharge  and  sinking fund or of terminable annuities running for a period ofyears, is a matter of detail which must be left  to  the decision  of financialexperts.  In order to deal with these matters it would probably be expedient to appoint  a special Compensation  Commission.   The  service  of the coalconpensation stock would be met from  a  sinking fund charged on the pro-ceeds of the nationalised coal industry.        Apart from the sum to be paid for the  acquisition of the collieries,our proposals for the creation of  a unified Coal and Power Industry under public  control   would  involve  the  outlay  of   a  considerable  amount ofcapital.   This would be eventually remunerative, but the return  on capital invested might not be immediately appreciable.        It may be  desirable  that  capital for coal development  should beraised, in the first instance, by the issue of a special National Coal Develop-ment Loan carrying  a  Government  guarantee.   The  loan  should  beredeemable at  a  definite  date by a sinking fund; but there  might with advantage be  some  elasticity in  the  arrangements  for the sinking  fund,so that  redemption payments were unequally spread over the period of theloan, little  or nothing being  provided for redemption during the first  fewyears of  the currency of  the loan.  While we attach  importance  to  theCoal and Power Industry being  in the  long run self-supporting, we  are anxious that it should not at the outset  be  burdened by heavy sinking fund charges upon capital which  has not yet become fully remunerative.        The period in which the loan would be redeemable should depend chiefly  on technical  considerations, such as the probable life of the plant which  it  is used to  establish.        After the Coal Development Loan is fully paid off, a charge corre- sponding to the  previous sinking  fund charges  on this loan  should be earmarked  for future  development purposes.    It  is desirable that  a. nationalised Coal  and  Power Industry  should normally provide  its  own capital, and be independent  of outside borrowing.  A  considerable propor tion of the existing capital invested in coal mining has  been provided  in days  gone  by  from  the reinvestment by colliery  firms of  a part of their own profits.  We hope that  under public control with  a definite fund  ear- marked for development  purposes, this  method of &quot; internal  &quot; financing of  new developments might be greatly  extended.         In the event of exceptional capital expenditure being again required at  some  iuture  date (e.g.,  for reorganisation  purposes arising from fresh scientific developments at present unforeseen), we contemplate that the industry  might  again  have  recourse  to  a   loan,  such  as   we   have
aiti.asbisuggested would be raised in order to set on foot the reorganisation schemes submitted in this evidence.  Any such application for a loan would naturallyrequire the sanction of the Power and Transport Commission.     (ii.) THE POSITION OF COAL EXPORTERS AND INTERNAL DISTRIBUTORS.         It is contemplated, as stated above, that the coal exriorb trade shouldbe placed  in the hands of Commissioners having a public monopoly underthe control  of the   Board of  Trade  and responsible to  Parliament, 01alternatively in the hands of  a  Public  Utility Corporation. It  is also  pro-posed that the internal distribution would,  in  general,  become a  publicmonopoly  in the hands of Local Authorities.         These new  coal distribution authorities would  no doubt wish to some extent to utilise the actual plant (carts, sacks, storage accommodation, etc.), of existing traders, and  payment would have to be made for the actual physical value of such plant.  The amount involved, however, would clearly be small,  and purchase would  take the form of  cash payment by the new authority.         As regards the services of persons  now actually  engaged  in  coal  export and  distribution, we  contemplate  that  these also would, in manj cases, be  employed  by the new distributing authorities.  At the same  time, the  evidence  shows that the  number of such persons is  excessive and thai the  simpler and more  economical method of distribution proposed wouliHfet render much  of their work redundant.  Where  the establishment of public] re monopolies in the export and  distribution  of coal thus  definitely  deprives! persons (employes and traders) of their means of livelihood, some equitable allowance should be made as  compensation  for disturbance.         The  cost of any such allowances for cases  of -hardship might pet haps be met  by the imposition of a small charge on the  retail  price of coal In view  of the wide margin now obtaining  between  the  pit-head  and thw retail price of coal  and the substantial economies which unified distributiotj in  would effect, it should still be possible, even with the addition of this charge; pf  to retail coal below existing  prices.                                        ar PC ax. Tl: ar ex fa di P*,P. in aiarsi-                        (iii.) MINERAL BOYALTIES.                        [,TI        With regard to the terms on which ownership of the minerals is t: :fbe acquired,  there is a difference of opinion among  the bodies which frame&apos; ft;the scheme.&apos;  We refrain,  therefore,  from submitting any proposals on thammatter; but  it may be stated that  the Miners&apos; Federation is opposed to th- grprinciple of compensation being given for mineral royalties.               of                                                                         C((F)  Observations on  the Scheme.                                    m         It is held that the coal industry as  at  present organised and  cot Iducted cannot cope effectively with its present  deplorable position,&quot; &quot;an 4 that unification and integration  are essential for  the future prosperity  c 4l the industry.   But  we do not believe  that the community would toleratJt1the existence  of a  Coal  Industry  Trust, even if  it were  subject  to Si:&apos;.: Wregulation.  The view  taken in this precis is that  the necessary reorganiss % tion should  be carried out under public auspices.         In  the scheme  submitted above a sincere attempt has been mac tri to  remove  the apprehensions which have been felt in the past  regardk P  nationalisation proposals.   It  has been  argued that publicly-owned servic-ca must necessarily  become the  subject of controversy in the political areoOT
 and that economic issues are distorted and influenced by political consideration- tions.  In  the  last  resort  questions  of  public policy including those associated with public services must be fought out  in the political  sphere; but in the foregoing scheme what is called political interference is reduced to a minimum and governmental intervention is confined to questions of general policy.    This  is  secured  by the establishment of  bodies  deriving  their authority  from Parliament  and  exercising  powers  conferred by  statute. These powers will be exercised independently of external control, but as they are  powers  granted  by Parliament they  may  be  revoked, modified,  or extended by Parliament, and therefore Parliament remains supreme.   The fact that the Power and Transport Commission and the Coal and Power Pro- duction  Council would enjoy statutory authority  would not relieve  them of public criticism, and  their  annual reports and  accounts would be subject to Parliamentary scrutiny, while it would be open to Parliament at any time to institute an inquiry  into  the exercise  of  the  powers  and  duties of  the authorities set up under the  scheme.         As regards the Power and Transport Commission,  so  far as  the administration of power transmission is concerned,  it woidd be a  business undertaking and  the  Commission would take  full  responsibility.  Where the question arose of the commercial application of the results of  research this, if  it involved  considerable  new public  expenditure, would  need to obtain   Government  approval.  The Commission^  duties concerning  the study of  power  and  transport  problems and  the  administration of  the regulations governing power  and transport undertakings should  be  a charge upon public  funds  and  would,  therefore,  be  subject  to  Parliamentary control.         So far as  the exercise of the statutory powers and duties of  the Commission and the Council are  concerned, the  Ministers  function in relation  to Parliament would be to  give information,  as Ministers do at present  with regard to, say,  the Electricity  Commissioners,  the Unemploy- ment Grants Committee, and the Trade Facilities Committee.   No question of Ministerial &quot; control &quot; arises so far as the statutory duties of these bodies are concerned, because Parliament will have limited the Ministers respon- sibility  by the conferment   of  powers  and duties  upon the  Power  and Transport Commission and the Production Council.         It is to be remembered that the industry is  to raise its capital from its own  resources or by loan,  with or without a Treasury guarantee, and that it will be required to pay its way.   There will be no question of Parliament granting subsidies,  and, therefore, mismanagement will recoil on the heads of those  in the  industry,  who will suffer economically.   Moreover,  the Consumers&apos; Council will be  interested in the efficiency of the industry  and may be trusted to exercise  effective pressure  on the industry to  fulfil its responsibilities.         Outside the  statutory duties of the authorities proposed to be set up under the scheme, the  President of the Board of Trade or the secretary i for Mines, as the case may be, will, of course, exercise ultimate responsibility, and  certain  duties will be conferred on these  Ministers by statute.   For example,  in the  all-important  matter  of the  determination of prices  the final arbiter is the President of the Board  of  Trade, who may decide  the issue himself  or refer it  for final  settlement to   a  specially constituted tribunal.  The Secretary for Mines would be Chairman of both the  Coal  and Power Production Council and the  Consumers&apos;  Council, and would  carry considerable influence, especially in joint  discussions between these  two bodies.
and that economic issues are distorted and influenced by political considexa-tions.  In  the  last  resort  questions  of  public  policy including those associated with public services must be fought out in the political sphere;but in the foregoing scheme what is called political interference is reduced toa minimum and governmental intervention is confined to questions of generalpolicy.    This  is  secured by the establishment  of  bodies  deriving  their authority  from  Parliament  and exercising  powers  conferred  by  statute.These powers will be exercised independently of external control, but as theyare  powers  granted  by  Parliament  they  may  be  revoked, modified, or extended by Parliament, and therefore Parliament remains supreme.   Thefact that the Power and Transport Commission and the Coal and Power Pro-duction  Council  would enjoy statutory authority would not relieve  them ofpublic criticism, and  their annual reports and accounts would be subject to parliamentary scrutiny, while it would be open to Parliament at any time to institute an inquiry  into  the exercise  of  the  powers and  duties of  theauthorities set up under  the  scheme.        As regards the  Power and Transport  Commission, so  far as  theadministration of power  transmission is concerned, it would be a  businessundertaking and the Commission  would take  full  responsibility.  Wherethe question arose of the commercial  application of the results of  researchthis, if  it involved  considerable new public expenditure, would  need toobtain   Government  approval.  The  Commission^ duties concerning  the study of  power and transport  problems and  the  administration of  theregulations governing power  and transport undertakings should  be  a charge upon public  funds  and  would, therefore,  be  subject  to  parliamentary control.        So far as  the exercise of the  statutory powers and duties of  theCommission and the Council are  concerned,  the  Ministers  function inrelation  to Parliament would be to give information, as Ministers do atpresent  with regard to, say,  the Electricity Commissioners, the Unemploy-ment Grants Committee, and the Trade Facilities Committee.  No questionof Ministerial &quot; control &quot; arises so far as the statutory duties of these bodies are  concerned, because Parliament will have limited  the Ministers respon-sibility  by the  conferment   of  powers  and  duties   upon the  Power andTransport Commission and the Production Council.        It is to  be remembered that the industry is to raise its capital fromits own  resources or by loan,  with or without a Treasury guarantee,  and thatit will be required to pay its  way.  There will be no question of Parliamentgranting subsidies, and, therefore, mismanagement will recoil on the headsof those in the industry, who will  suffer economically.   Moreover,  the consumers&apos; Council will be interested in the efficiency of  the industry andmay be trusted to  exercise  effective pressure on the industry to  fulfil its responsibilities.        Outside the  statutory duties of the authorities proposed to be setup under the scheme, the President of the Board of Trade or the Secretaryfor Mines, as the case may be, will, of course, exercise ultimate responsibility,and  certain  duties  will be conferred on these  Ministers by statute.   Forexample,  in the all-important  matter  of the determination of prices  thefinal arbiter is the  President of  the Board of Trade,  who may  decide  theissue himself  or refer  it  for final  settlement to  a  specially constitutedtribunal.  The Secretary for  Mines would be Chairman of both the Coal and power Production  Council and the Consumers&apos; Council,  and  would  carryconsiderable influence,  especially in joint  discussions between these twobodies.
        Closely connected with the criticism regarding political interferenceis the criticism that nationalisation involves &quot;  bureaucracy.&quot;  It will havebeen seen already that the authorities set up under the scheme will be free from petty restrictions and day to day supervision by any external authority.The  Power and Transport Commission would consist  of  men of special qualifications and experience of the problems associated with power and trans-port ; the Coal and Power Production Council will consist of people actuallvengaged in the coalmining industry and the treatment of coal; and the exportof coal will be in the hands of a Commission of business men, with experienceof the coal trade, or of  a public utility corporation, the personnel  of whichwould be similar in character  to that of the  coal exporting  firms  at thepresent time.  The term &quot; bureaucracy &quot; is more accurately  applicable tothe large railway companies and other large privately-owned  combinationsthan to the present scheme.        There is  a  fear that in a nationalised  industry the producers mayoccupy an extremely  strong strategic position  which would  enable them to force unreasonable  demands.   It is clear that the  producers  in a publicly owned  industry have a strong claim for reasonable treatment, but it  isequally clear  that  the  community cannot normally permit  conditions ofemployment  which the industry cannot  sustain, or which  are unfair to consumers.  It has never been proposed by the Labour Movement that the producers in  a nationally-owned industry should determine their  remunera-tion for themselves, without regard to economic realities and public opinion.The present  scheme  attempts to  secure fair  treatment for the producers and as far  as possible to keep these questions  outside the realm of political controversy.         In privately-owned  industries negotiations concerning wages andconditions are normally conducted between representatives  of the organisa-tions of the  employers and  the employes.  With  a nationalised industry,however, this method is unsuitable, as it would involve negotiations betweenthe  State as owner and the employes&apos; representatives,  and the discussion would  immediately be fought out in  the cockpit of politics a course whichwe deem to be undesirable from the  point  of view of both  the industry andthe  State.         We  have  taken the  view  that  the  consumers,   if  they  can  be adequately organised as they can in the case of coal and  power might bethe body with whom the producers should, in the first place, negotiate  on questions which  may involve  an  increased charge  upon consumers.   This method  is the  more desirable  because the  elimination  of  waste,   better co-ordination, and  the  development of new methods and processes will, we believe,  result in  large gains, and  the proportions in which  those gains should be  allocated to  the producers and  consumers respectively can only be decided by considerations with which only actual producers and  repre- sentatives of consumers can be familiar.          Whilst we do not assert that this method is necessarily one capable of general application in publicly-owned services, we believe that it would be advantageous in  the coal and power  industry for the determination of wages and prices.  Should  it fail, then in the case of  wage negotiations we would  suggest  a reference of the questions at issue to a specially  constituted court. In the case  of a disagreement regarding prices, we believe that  this should be  dealt with either by the President of the  Board of Trade or a  tribunal set up by him.          We have sought in this proposal to ensure that justice shall be done  to both  the  producers&apos; and the consumers&apos; points  of view.
        Finally, it may be thought that our proposals are somewhat com-plicated.  In a sense this is  true.   The  administration of the CanadianNational Railways (with its railroads, ships, telegraphs,  and hotels) is com-plicated, as also is the administration of the British Railway Companies, theLever Combine, the  Imperial Tobacco Company, or indeed  of  any greatcombination. But, in fact, the proposed scheme is simpler than  the actualadministration  of the coal and  allied industries  under private ownership.We have already pointed  out  that the present coal mining industry corn-prises  some  3,000  pits and  over 1,000  separate  concerns,  each  of  thecompanies  with its  separate  Board  of  Directors,  most  of them actingindependently  and  without  any  general co-ordination.   Some of theseBoards  are  interlocked with the Boards  of Management of iron and steel and other concerns.   Some colliery firms are coal exporters, some  are  not.The  coal which they supply passes through the hands of a  hierarchy  of factors, agents, wholesale dealers and retailers,  of whom there are about27,000 in all.   The  production of electricity is  in the hands  of a  largenumber of public and private undertakings, whilst there  are in  additioncoking plants and hydro-electric schemes, all of  them, or at any  rate thevast majority  of them,  conducted  as  separate concerns  with  separateadministrations.  Compared with the over-swollen administrative  arrange-ments,  uncoordinated  and  indeed  for the most part unrelated,  in theexisting coal, power,  and coal  treatment enterprises, the proposals set forth above  are  relatively  simple.
