Position of widows whose husbands had been                incapable of work for more than three years                before death - High Court decision in                Jennings and others v. Minister of Health.Memorandum by the Minister of Health.          It is necessary for me to draw the attention of myoolleagues.to a serious difficulty which has arisen in theapplication of one of the statutory conditions for thoaward of pensions under the Oontributory Pensions Act, 1929,to pre-Aot widows.          The Aot provides a wi&amp;Ow*s pension on the attainment of the age of 55 for the widow of a man who died before4th January, 1926, and as respects whom it is shown that hisnormal  occupation was at some time within threo years before his death employment in respect of which contributions under theprincipal Aot (the Contributory Pensions  Aot 1925) wouldhave been payable If that Aot had been in force at that time.          It is to be noted that a similar condition wasoontained in the Act of 1925 as regards the title to pensions of widows in this claps who had young ohildren, tho onlydifference being that in the earlier Act the normal occupationtest was to be applied as at the death of the husband insteadof  as at some time within three years of his death *The reason for the diffcronoe was that under the Act of 1939,where  title was not dependant on there being young children,
claims could be made by widows of men who had died very manyyears ago and for administrative reasons it was thought necessary to provide that the condition might be satisfied atany time over an extended period rather than at a particularpoint of time, the date of death of the deceased husbando          In connection with the administration of the 1925Act claims were received from many widows whose husbandsthough regularly engaged in insurable employment until theyfell ill had done no work by reason of  Incapacity for some time before death.   The Department was advised that the normaloccupation which the man possessed when he fell ill should beregarded as persisting throughout the period  of incapacity.Pensions were accordingly awarded to many widows whose husbandshad for some time,  in many cases for years, before their  deathdone no work by reason of incapacity.          The same  practice was adopted in dealing with claims arising under the Act of 1929 and some thousands  of awardswere made to widows whose husbands by reason  of illness had done no work in the last three years of their lives and in somecases for a considerable period previous to the commencementof these three years.    In a number of  cases  however  In whichit was claimed that the husband had been  incapable of work for more than three years before his death, evidence  of incapacitysufficient  to satisfy the Department was not  forthcoming  andthe  claims  were rejected.          Under the 1925 Act the Minister&apos;s  decision  on thisquestion was  final  and  conclusive and  in preparing the Billfor  the Act  of 1929 I adopted the same  solution.   But thequestlon of ministering- jurisdiction of this  kind was  beginning to be the subject of public  discussion  and  I  was  compelled whenthe  bill was  passing through the House  of  Commons to  accept an amendment which allowed  a right  of appeal, not on the  questionof the  insurability of  a given  occupation, but on the  question2.
                                                       1   9!7what wa3 the.....normal jocc-up at ion if any, -within three&quot;yearsof death of a person in respect of whan a claim arises.          Some months ago appeals made by certain widowswhose claims had been rejected because the Department wasnot satisfied that their husbands had boen prevented byreason of incapacity from following the Insurable occupation in which they were once engaged were considered by theReferees^   In a number of these cases the Referees were satisfied that incapacity had existed throughout theperiod following the cessation of  insurable employment butthey dissented from the view, on which the department had consistently acted, that a man*s normal occupationpersisted throughout a period of incapacity.   In their view incapacity terminated the normal  occupation so thatthe condition required by the Aest  could not be satisfiedIn a case where the husband had been continouslyIncapacitated for more than three  years before death.          This conflict of interpretation made it necessaryto hold up  all undecided  claim3  involving this question until a decision could be  obtained from the High Court asto the effect of incapacity  on normal  occupation.          The number of claims in  England and  Wales Inwhich a decision has not  been given because of thisoutstanding question is approximately  2,600.   In each ofthese cases pension would  be awarded  if the Departmentalview prevailed.          Three cases were put before  the Court, the  facts of each case being  slightly  different.    In all three  theCase f-asrnd  as a fact that the man  had  become permanentlyincapable before the date from which the  three years  ran*In  one case the period between the time when incapacityoccurred  and the commencement  of the  three years was as longas  10 years, in another the  period was as short as sixWr-okBj  and  in r,he third case which&quot; was seleoted as .atypical intermediate case tdie period was  two years,                          3c
           The  cr.iugment of the High  Court was given on the17th December  last and a coijy is attached.   Its effect is toexcltide on the  one hand the view which the Department had previously taken that periods of incapacity, whether temporaryor permanent,  ought to be left out  of acoount in judgingwhether a  man  has retained a normal ocoupation and, on theother hand, the view which the Referees were disposed to take,that a olaim could not be admitted  unless the man was actually occupied within the three  years before his death.           The  judgment indicated that it was open to theReferees as a matter of law either  to admit or rejeot eaohof the three claims.           After exhaustive consideration of the problem raisedby the decision, only one type of oase has been discovered inwhich there would be general agreement that the normalocoupation could be regarded as persisting until within threeyears of death, though the man had been incapable of work for more than  three years.   Such a caso would be one in which atthe commencement of the three years there was ground forthinking that the incapacity would be only temporary,  though in the event it proved to be permanent.   But owing to the impossibility of obtaining aoourate information as to  thoposition existing many years ago,  very few oases would be foundto satisfy this test.    Since the High Court decision was giventhe Referees have been engaged in considering a representativesample of  the oases under appeal,  but in the result they havenot admitted a  single claim from amongst all those in whiohthey were  satisfied that the man had a normal occupation ofinsurable  employment immediately before the onset of thoincapacity, which commenced more than three years before his death,
                 It  is  olear  that the  application of  the above teat       to  the  2,600  oas.ee whioh have not yet  been decided by tho       Department would ahow  that all  but  a negligible number would       fail  to paaa  the  teat, with the result that almost all the       oases would have to  be rejected.    To reject praotloally the       whole of  these outstanding cases would, however, be       inconsistent  with the  line taken by the Department before the       correctness of its view was challenged, which resulted in       pensions  being awarded in some  thousands of oaaea of this type.                 There  is no  doubt that the intention of the Aot was       that  incapacity,  whether temporary  or permanent, should be       disregarded in applying the normal  occupation teat and the       financial  estimates  were made on this understanding.   If effect       is  to be given to that intention it will be necessary to       introduce  legislation which, being  limited to this specific       point,  would require only a one-clause Bill.                 I understand that this question has been considered       by  the  Scottish Referees and that  it has been deoided to state       a case  in  Scotland for the opinion  of the Court of Session.   it       is  possible that  the decision of the Scottish Court on this       point may  be at  variance with the decision of the English Court       and this  possibility is an additional reason for putting the     &apos;  position  beyond  doubt  by legislation.

IN THE HIGH COURT  OP  JUSTICE            ROYAL COURTS  OF JUSTICE.K^G^S^^iTTTTIgOT&apos;;^-           ^d^esdayTTfth DeoemEer,  1950.r^Tatonal C court)  Before:  MR. JUSTICE  AVORYj  MR*  JUSTICE  SWIFT, and MR.  JUSTICE  CHARLES..                            JENNINGS and  others                                    - v -                               MINISTER OF  HEALTH.                                 JUDGMENT.^MR. JUSTICE AVORY:  the question of law which  Is raised  in this  case is  whether the  Referees under the  Act of 1929 are entitled to find in  each  of these cases that the widows respectively are entitled  to  pensions or  whether thay are as a matter  of  lav/ bound  to hold  that  they  are not, nor is either of  them, entitled  to pensions.   In the  opinion &apos; of the Court,  on the facts of each  of these cases it is  open  to the Referees to find as a matter  of law that all of them or  any one of  them is entitled to a pension, and  it is equally open to  them  as a matter of law to find on the facts of these  Cases that  neither of them is entitled to a pension.   In other words, they are  not,  as a matter of law, limited to enquire  whether the former husband  of the widow was in fact actively engaged in any occupation within  the three years preceding his death;  it  is  open to them in each case,  for the purposes of ascertaining what his normal occupation was within  tho meaning of section 1 sub-section 1 paragraph A(2), to enquire into  the circumstances of the man&apos;s occupation prior to that period of three  years;  and on the  other hand as a matter of  law the  Court is of  opinion that it is not right to say-that  if  a  husband has acquired an  occupational status afr any time prior to that  period  of three  years,  -the Referees are therefore bound to hold  that  he still retains the  normal occupation which arose from what Mr.  Murphy has called an  occupational status if it has been once acquired.            Those answers will enable the Referees to deal with  each  of these cases on its merits.
