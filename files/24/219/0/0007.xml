THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.                   Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1931.SECRET.                                                   Copy  No.   5CP. 7  (31).                                 CABINET.TIN  RESTRICTION.        MEMORANDUM BY  THE SECRETARY OF  STATE FOR  THE COLONIES.    TIN mining is  one of the principal  industries of Malaya,  which produced69,366 tons*&apos; in 1929  out. of a total world production of 186,518 tons.  It is also animportant industry in Nigeria, which in 1929 produced 10,412 tons.  The Govern-ments of both these countries have been seriously affected in revenue by the recentcollapse in the price  of tin. The extent of this collapse is shown by the following figures of the average cash  price of metallic tin on the London market :                                                                 1921    .........   165           1926    .........  2911922    .........   159           1927    .........  2891923    .........   202           1928    .........  2271924    .........   249           1929.........  2041925    .........   261For the j^ear 1930, the monthly average price was as follows :-                                      January      ......   176          JuneFebruaryMarch  .AprilMay174165163145JulyAugust ...SeptemberOctober  1361351351 o olOO133Since then it has been as low as  105, but rose as the proposals for restriction became known, and on the 8th January stood at  120.    In view of the fall in price and the accumulation of stocks, efforts have beenmade throughout  the  past year by  the  Tin Producers&apos;  Association  to restrictproduction.   A  scheme  was formulated  by the  Tin Producers&apos;  Association  inDecember 1929, and was widely adopted about February  1930.  The details of thisscheme, which was modified in April 1930, were briefly as follows :     (1) All plants in operation throughout 1929  and working in 1930 shall be so           regulated as to produce in the calendar year 1930 not  more than 80 per           cent,  of their output in  1929.    (2) All plants which began operations later than the 1st January,  1929, shall           be so regulated  as to produce in the  calendar year 1930  not more than           80 per cent, of their estimated production for 1930.    (3) Where methods (1) and (2) are inapplicable, regulation on a time basis may          be  adopted, provided the  maximum  working time  does not exceed          80 per cent, of the normal.    The  Malay States  and Nigerian Governments were not asked to assist in thisvoluntary restriction  scheme, but both Governments realised that it was not in their interests  that their tin ore reserves  should be depleted at uneconomic prices.  TheFederated Malav States Government,  in November  1929,  decided  to consider no[22335]* Tin statistics are quoted in long tons, each equalling 2,240 lbs.
further applications for mining leases of tin mining land, or for the conversion ofagricultural to mining land, except in special cases, and the Nigerian Governmentwaived its normal requirements as to the amount of work necessary in each miningarea, and decided not to grant new mining leases.    The voluntary  restriction scheme has  had a certain measure of success.  TheTin Producers&apos; Association claims that, without it, the 1930 production would havebeen between  30,000 and  40,000  tons more than it actually was, but, throughout1930, there was a rapid falling off in tin consumption, despite the heavy falls inthe price of the metal, with the result that visible supplies of tin, which  were29,249 tons in November and  32,449 tons  in December  1929,  had by June  1930increased to 46,385  tons, and remained round about that figure for the rest of  1930.That this accumulation represents large overproduction is shown by the  fact thatthe average  visible world stocks for each of  the preceding  ten  years  werefollows : as19201921192219231924Long tons.   19,725   19,697   24,683   21,740   21,25419251926192719281929Long tons.   19,538   15,386   14,925   18,393   25,181The estimated figures for world consumption of tin are :  192619271928 Tons.133.362138,908152,6021929193011 months: January   to November) Tons.165,900129,000    The voluntary restriction scheme was naturally difficult to work.   Tin pro-duction in the Netherlands East Indies is easily controlled, as it is concentrated in three  concerns :   Banka,  a  Government Mine;  Billiton,  a Government-controlledCompany; and Singkep, a small independent producer.  The Dutch seem to havehad some justification for thinking that in Malaya, where there are many producers,the curtailment  achieved  under  voluntary restriction was not as much as had been promised.  They are in a strong position, as it is admitted that the Dutch are the cheapest producers.  (They claim to be able to produce at a profit at the Banka Minewith tin at  80 a ton.)   They informed the Tin Producers&apos; Association  that theywould cease to participate in restriction as from the end of 1930 unless curtailmentcould be placed under  Government control.   Many Malayan producers  were alsodissatisfied with the failure  of the scheme  to  maintain the  price  of  tin at  areasonable level, which they attributed     (a) To uncertainty as to  how  long the scheme would continue on a  voluntary           basis; and    (b) To failure of certain producers to take their proper part in it.    As a result of the  difficulties experienced,  the Tin Producers&apos;  Associationarranged  a Conference in London on the 26th November, 1930, which was attended by the  Governor of the Straits Settlements  (Sir  Cecil Clementi), the Director ofIndustries of the Netherlands East  Indies (Mr. de  Jongh),  two Directors  of theBilliton Company, two  representatives of Bolivian  producers  (one of whom was mr.  Patino), and Sir P. Cunliffe Lister, Sir William  Peat and Mr.  J.  Howeson.representing  the Tin Producers&apos; Association.  The Conference recommended      (a) That the world&apos;s production  of tin metal  for  1931  should  be fixed at           145,000 long tons.   This figure to be capable of alteration  from time to           time by mutual agreement.     (b) That the quotas of production permitted to be exported during 1931 and           1932 should be based upon the actual output in 1929  in the following-           ratios :                                                                 Per cent.               Federated Malay States   ...       ...       ...       35-9               Netherlands East Indies, Bolivia and Nigeria ...       49-6           the rest of the world having produced in 1929 14-5 per cent., of which           5-3 per cent,  was produced in Siam.
     (c)  That on the definite conclusion of an  agreement between the Governments,            representations should be made to the Government of Siam, but that the            agreement should not be made dependent upon the consent of the Siamese            Government to become a party thereto.     By  a supplemental  agreement  signed  by the  Bolivian and  Netherlands east indies&apos;  representatives and by  Sir William Peat and Mr. Howeson, it was  agreedthat the quota of 49-6 per cent,  allotted to the  Netherlands East Indies, Bolivia and nigeria and representing 71,920 tons  on the  basis of  a total world production of145,000  tons should be apportioned as follows  :                                                                      Tons.              Banka           ...        ...       ...        ...     19,070              Billiton and Singkep Companies  ...        ...     10,840              Bolivia          ...        ...        ...       ...    34,260              Nigeria          ...        ...       ...        ...      7,750                       Total   ...        ...       ...        ...     71,920     It was further agreed that any increase in the tonnages permitted to be exportedwill be divided in the above-mentioned proportions.     It was subsequently explained that the Malayan quota of 35-9 per  cent, did not include  the  output of the Unfederated Malay States, the allocation of  which wasagreed (in a supplemental minute) to be 1-24 per cent., that is,  in 1931 on the basisof a world production of 145,000 tons, 1,798 tons, making a total quota from Malayaof 37-14 per cent., that is, 53,853 tons.     A  further meeting  of  representative  tin  producers organised  by the TinProducers&apos; Association.was held in Paris on the 4th December and was attended byMr. Groothoff, as a delegate from the Netherlands East  Indies Government.   Thefollowing has been supplied as a record of that Meeting :      &quot; It is  recommended that :         &quot;1. The quotas shall become operative as from the first day of January, 1931, and continue-     save  as hereinafter provided-for  a minium period  of two years.   The quotas have been so    calculated  as to  provide in the first instance that the maximum supplies of tin  to be made    available shall not exceed the monthly equivalent of 145,000 tons per annum, and for this purpose    the monthly quotas have been assessed  on the annual basis of       ; &quot; (a)  53,253 tons for the Federated  and Unfederated Malay States, and       &quot; (b)  71,920 tons for Bolivia,  the Dutch East Indies and Nigeria,  that israteably in both               cases to the actual agreed  outputs in  1929.       &quot; In order to enforce these respective quotas,  the Malayan, Bolivian and Nigerian Govem-    ments  will introduce  the  appropriate  legislative enactments,   and the  Dutch  East   Indian    Government  will  furnish  a  statutory  declaration  in  form acceptable  to  the   three  other    Governments.  The four Governments are hereinafter  referred to  as the &apos; interested parties.&apos;       &quot; 2. A Special International Committee shall be appointed in the form and manner suggested    in the Appendix  hereto, this Committee to meet at regular  intervals to inquire into the general    conditions of trade and the tin industry, to report in an advisory capacity and, when necessary,    to submit  proposals to the Interested Parties.       &quot;3. The  quotas shall  not  be  increased unless the current &quot;visible supplies,&apos;  having been    depleted to a maximum  quantity  of 25,000 tons, shall not exceed that  figure  during three    consecutive months, or unless the average price quoted for standard tin  on the London  Metal    Exchange  shall for three consecutive months have exceeded  180; and then only provided that    either one of  the interested parties  or the special  Committee  shall  propose  an increase of    production and that such rate of increase is mutually agreed.  For the purpose of this  clause    the term &apos;  visible  supplies &apos; shall be interpreted to mean the figure of total visible supply published    monthly in the Official Tin Statistics of the London. Metal  Exchange, to which  shall bo  added    the quantity of tin referred to in the same  Statistics -as &apos; Carry Over in Straits.&apos;       &quot;4. If mutual agreement shall not be reached in the terms of the preceding clause within a    period of six months of the Meeting of the Special Committee called to consider, an increase of    production, then  the International agreement can be cancelled by any of the interested parties.       &quot; 5. If an increase has been mutually agreed  in  the terms of clause 2, and thereafter the     visible supplies&apos; shall again have exceeded 25,000 tons for more  than  one  month or during    the same period the average price of tin shall have fallen below  180 per ton, then the Committee    shall  meet to consider a reduction  of  output.  Similarly, should the production be found to be    too high after the initial quotas have been in force  for a period of three months,  then also shall    the Committee discuss the  desirability of a reduction  of output.       &quot;6. Any agreed increase in the rate  of output shall be apportioned in strict ratio to the    quotas set forth in clause 1.       &quot; 7. Each of the interested parties shall  communicate by telegraph at the end of  every    month to the  Secretary of the Special Committee the official figures relating to the tin exported    from  their respective territories.       [22335]                                                                B 2
        &quot; S.  Any lesser quantity exported than the allowance for the month may be exported during    the ensuing three months.  Any greater quantity-which (excepting in the case of force tiiajenre)    shall not exceed the allowance by more than 10 per cent.-shall be deducted from the allowance    for the ensuing two months.

The Special Committee to consist of Official and non-Official Members.        &quot; 2.  All appointments to the Special Committee to be submitted in writing and to be attested    by the respective Government in the case of Official Members  nominated by  the Governments    concerned, and by the Tin Producers&apos; Association in the case of non-Official Members.        *&apos; 3.  The Special Committee to appoint.a Chairman and two Vice-Chairmen, each of whom    shall hold office for six months from the date of appointment,  and  thereafter shall not be eligible    to hold the same office for a period of one year. The first Chairman to be a British Member,    and the two first vice-Chairmen to be respectively Dutch and Bolivian Members.  The two first    Vice-Chairmen in rotation shall be appointed Chairmen during the second and third half-yearly    periods.        &quot; 4.  The Special Committee to appoint a permanent Secretary, who shall be responsible    inter alia for the Minutes of all Meetings and for the records of the correspondence exchanged    between the Committee and the &apos; interested  parties.&apos;        ;&apos; 5.  The official language  of all Meetings  shall be English, but the Minutes and other    necessary documents shall, if required, be translated into Spanish and Dutch for the  convenience    of the Bolivian and Dutch Governments.        &quot; 6. The Special Committee to be primarily an Advisory body,   but its resolutions, if and    when accepted by all the &apos; interested parties,&apos; shall bind those parties.&quot;     I consulted the Governments of  Nigeria and the Federated Malay  States bytelegraph on the general aspects of the scheme, and the Acting Governor of Nigeriareplied that he considered that Nigeria, which is a comparatively high cost producer,would benefit by restriction.  Subject to my being satisfied that Nigeria&apos;s quota hadbeen fixed on an equitable basis, he recommended that Nigeria should participate inthe scheme.  I am satisfied that the quotas are equitable.     As regards Malaya,  it  appeared that  there  was a  certain  amount of localopposition, which may  be  attributed,  at  least in part, to the  smelters.   In order toascertain the views of the  Malayan producers,  a  circular was issued  on  the30th December by the Warden of Mines, and local meetings of producers  are being held.  The Malayan Government will be prepared  to  come  in if the bulk of localproducers declare in favour of the scheme, and the necessary legislation is mean-while being prepared.  They would have preferred that the scheme should  not be retrospective to the 1st January, but it is clearly essential  to adhere to that date ifthe present scheme is to be adopted.   The Tin Producers&apos; Association has reportedthat  the  Netherlands East Indies and Bolivian  Governments  have approved  thepresent scheme on the understanding that it comes into force as from the 1st January,and that they confidently anticipate the  adherence of Siam.   Any interval betweenthe  end  of  the   voluntary  restriction  scheme  on the 31st December,  and  theintroduction of the compulsory one would upset the basis on  which the compulsoryscheme has  been  calculated.   Hence, any ore exported  from  Malaya  from  the1st January onwards must be included in Malaya&apos;s quota, even though the necessary legislation to restrict exports to the agreed quota is not yet enacted.     Malaya, would also have greatly  preferred that the scheme should be one foractual restriction  of production, as in the case of the voluntary scheme, instead ofmerely restriction of exports.  While I do not rule  out  the possibility that theGovernment  representatives  who  will control the  working   of  the  scheme  mightdiscuss  that  suggestion and adopt  it  if  all  agree,  it appears  unlikely  that international agreement could be reached on that basis.  Exports can be controlled,but control of actual production would be difficult.  Moreover, if export is curtailed,it appears improbable that any great  number of producers will mine more ore thanthey are allowed to export, as tin ore is expensive to produce  and store, and  capitalwill not be forthcoming to finance local stocks which cannot  be exported.     The  grounds  for advocating a compulsory restriction scheme are as follows  :Stocks  are  still accumulating and the&apos; price has fallen to  a figure which  is  notremunerative to most producers.  In Malaya, costs of production vary considerably.
 jmt it is estimated by the Malayan Government that the average cost of production %y dredging is  115, and that a normal Chinese mine can produce at  200, including depreciation,  &amp;c.  Over 50 per cent, of the Malayan production is from Chinese mines.  The Tin Producers&apos; Association states that it has detailed cost  figures of a i i classes of production other than Chinese, and that only a very small proportion of the dredging output can be obtained at an all-in cost of  115 per ton of metal. Voluntary restriction has failed, and the Dutch, who are the cheapest  producers, liave  rejected voluntary restriction as ineffective, but  are prepared to adhere to a compulsory scheme.   If restriction, is not enforced, over-production will continue, jbrices may fall still further, and  a large number of mines will  be forced to close clown.  The unemployment problem in Malaya, which is already serious, will become acute.  The Governments of Malaya and Nigeria have a great financial  interest in She continuance of tin-production, on which much of their revenues depend.   In the interest of  the  tin  consumers, as  well  as  of producers, it is  desirable  that some stability of price should be attained, instead of violent fluctuations.  The compulsory scheme wall cover at least 86 per cent, of the world&apos;s production.  The Tin Producers&apos; Association claim that it will cover practically 90 per cent, of the wrorld&apos;s output, or 95 per cent, if, as  is probable,  Siam adheres, so  it has good prospects of  being successful.&apos;  It is  unlikely that producers outside the scheme could increase their production to any serious extent. i  A less obvious advantage to this country which would result from an improve- jnent in the price of tin is its effect on  the  United States Exchange.  Of the total Malayan  exports of  102,026 tons in 1929, 57,696 tons were destined for the United States, as against only 15,395 tons for  the  United Kingdom.  On the basis of an export to the United States of only 50.000 tons, a fall in the price of tin  from  200 to  100 a ton means a decrease in the annual sterling payment by the United States if  5,000,000.    It is not proposed that  any  expenditure  in connection with this  restriction scheme should fall upon His Majesty&apos;s Government,  but the matter is one that should be brought before the Cabinet as. it may be represented that the  scheme affects the interests of tin consumers here.   There is, however,  good ground for arguing that in the long  run consumers also will benefit from price stability at a reasonable level, -instead of fluctuations between  100 and  400 per ton. 1  No undertaking of approval of the scheme as prepared by the Tin Producers&apos; Association has  been given.   Until I  know that His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  is prepared to alkw the Governments of  Nigeria and Malaya to participate in the scheme, I have felt it would be premature to consider details.  I am satisfied that it  will be to the public interest to  adopt the main essentials of the present scheme, that  is, to let the Governments  enforce it  from 1st January, 1931, restriction to be only of exports unless all the Governments should agree to restrict production, the several quotas to be the agreed percentages of the  1929 production, whilst,  almostKertainly, 145,000 tons will be taken as the basis for the aggregate of quotas at the start.   But I am not at all satisfied with the machinery proposed by  the  Paris Hieeting for working the scheme.   I consider that control must be in the  hands, not gf the tin producers or their  association, but of a Committee of  representatives of the four  Governments  concerned.    The Tin Producers&apos; Association may appointpome of its members to offer advice and suggestions to  the  Government represen-[ tatives, but the fixing of the initial quotas and any subsequent alterations of them in  an upward  or downward direction must  be at  the absolute  discretion   of the  representatives  of  the  four  Governments.  I  contemplate  that  the  Dutch and IBolivian  Governments should  be asked officially to appoint their representatives (the  Tin  Producers&apos;  Association have  informed  -me  that  the  Netherlands  East !Indies&apos; Government has already appointed Mr.  Groothoff as its representative and  that  the Bolivian Government has appointed Mr. Vargas and Mr. Patino).  Then the  Government representatives would, meet and review the original scheme and the Supplementary recommendations resulting from the Paris meeting and agree among Biemselves on the details of the scheme which they would enforce. If the Governments.Hontrol the scheme it may be  assumed that no attempt will he made to force up the  price too high.   I  understand that the Dutch,  as the cheapest producers,  have Kjheady indicated that they are opposed  to the figure of as much as  200 a ton which Maine members of the Tin Producers&apos; Association had in view.   In both Nigeria and fc% Federated Malay States there is an official majority in the Legislature, so His Bfajesty&apos;s Government could  always require the legislation,  which will  have to be  passed limiting the  export of tin ore, to be in such terms as it  desires.
                                       (J    Accordingly,  on the assumption that the Malayan Government accepts theprinciple of restriction as to which a definite reply may be expected any day i recommend that I be authorised to allow Nigeria and Malaya to join a compulsoivrestriction scheme for the initial period of two years, on the  definite understandingthat the scheme is controlled by representatives of the four Governments concerned and that I am satisfied as to the details.
