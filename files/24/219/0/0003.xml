THE FINANCIAL SITUATION.               LPHORANDUM BY TEE  CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER.                    The Budget prospect for 1931  is a  grim one.   The          apprehensions entertained in the autumn are  being more  than          confirmed and as each  month passes with no sign of  a  lifting          of the world  economic  crisis, the financial  prospect          constantly and steadily deteriorates.                                  i                    Although some of the more vital data for          estimates are still unavailable  and at  present therefore          there must be a considerable element of conjecture  in the          calculations, it is time  to  attempt to  visualise the  Budget          which must be introduced  within  four months&apos; time.                    In March of  last year  the Budget of 1929/30,          originally prepared by the last  Government,  ended with  a          deficit  of  14-fr millions.  In  the present year, 19 30/31 ,          substantial increases  of  taxation were  imposed,  which it          was  estimated would produce   34^- millions  additional          revenue  and leave  a Budget surplus of  2^- millions.          In fact  there will be  a deficit, which  may  reach  40          millions, and while  I  hope it  may not  be  so  bad  as  that,          it will  certainly  be far heavier than  in  1929/30.                    For the  coming year, 1931/2,  beginning April          next, the present  indications  are that  expenditure, if                                      -I-                                               secret^3j32JLa.
nothing Is done to reduce it-, will rise by perhaps 20 millions, vtfcilcg our receipts must fall by  12millions sines there is only  4 millions left foruse next year in- the Eating Relief Suspense Accent,from which we got help this year  (1930/31) to theextent of  16 millions.   On the  data at present available, I have to face the possibility of a deficit next year in the order of  50 millions, andif things continue to get worse,  it may even be upwards of  70 millions.          In reaching these figures for 1931/32 I havenot provided anything for the repayment of the deficit of the current year 1930/31.  Under our own finance act of this year, as it stands, I am obliged toprovide additional Revenue in. 1931/32 to make good the whole amount of this year&apos;s deficit.    2.    It is -vac me times argued that there is no real deficit,on the ground that the Budget provides a Sinking Fund which should more  than offset anydeficit and that in times like these we would bejustified in curtailing the Sinking Fund.  Thisplausible argument is entirely fallacious.  In thefirst place, the great bulk of the Budget provisionfor debt redemption is required to provide the specific Sinking Funds attached to particular Loansunder the terms of the prospectuses of those loans.Any curta.ilment of these Sinking  Funds would bo -adeflriiis breach of the contractual obligations on thefaith of which the loans in question were subscribed
by the public, end the shock to British  creditwhich would be caused by such measures would far  outweighany advantage that we could hope to gain.    Secondly,in present conditions, it is not true to say thatthe Sinking Fuul aoro than offsets the Budget deficit.There is a large expenditure which ought to be charged on the Budget but which we are meeting out of borrowing.   In particular, the Unemployment insurance fund is borrowing at the rate of  40 millions a year,though there Is little or no prospect of any part ofthis debt ever being repaid.   This borrowing, whichis unprecedented in peace time, must certainly bebrought  into the reckoning.   Thirdly,  the policy proposed would not even pay.   Any suspension ofthe Sinking Fund would immediately depreciate thewhole of the  7,000,000,000 of Government securities.It would increase the cost of the  legitimate borrcw-ings which the  Government has to undertake  eachyear for local  loans  and  similar purposes.   Itwould postpone  indefinitely  all prospects ofthe  conversion  of the war debt to  a  lower
                                                              t u    interest basis, which is one of the few hopeful means of    securing a reduction of expenditure in the future   It is    possible that the existence of a small &quot;free&quot; surplus on the    Sinking Fund  (i.eD a margin over and above the contractual    Sinking funds on particular loans), together with some other    special factors, might justify some reconsideration of the    provision in  the last Finance Act requiring the deficit of any    year  to be redeemed during the succeeding year;  but even    action of this limited character requires to be considered    with  the utmost care, or it may well accentuate the evils    that  it is intended to remedy.          5.   This country cannot afford a Budget with any sort    of  deficito   From the internal point of view alone there    are compelling reasons for maintaining the country&apos;s credit0    The falling off of revenue coupled with the constant increase    of expenditure and the great demands for new capital resources    occasioned by borrowing particularly for the Unemployment    Fund,are swiftly bringing back our floating debt to the    dangerous high level at which it stood a year ago.   The    improvement in the short term position effected by the new    issues of the autumn of ICS9 and the spring of 1930 will be    worse than lost, and next year further borrowing will be    required for&quot; agriculture and roadsb(In.- addition to the normal    borrowings for local loans and telephones).   If in these    conditions the public look upon the Budget as unsound, it will    become a question whether they can be induced to subscribe for    the short term accommodlation which Is vital to finance and equally    whether they can be induced to subscribe  to any necessary long    term loans,  be they required to meet the  growing mass of    general indebtedness or to be expended on fruitful schemes of    national work.   Failure to secure the necessary short termination
accommodation will prejudice the continuance of cheap moneywith all that that implies^,   Failure to obtain necessary-long term money at reasonable rates will not merely postponeall prospects of successful conversion of the war debt, but will jeopardise the whole improvement in the long term rateof interest which has characterised recent months and which,if maintained,is full of promise for business in the future     4,   This is not scare-mongering;  in present conditionsof gloom and anxiety these would be the necessary consequences of unsound State finance:  nor is the probability of othergraver consequences - a breakdown of our financial organisationand the removal of great sums abroad - lightly to be dismissed,.There are disquieting indications that the national finance,and especially the continuously increasing load of debtupon the Unemployment Insurance Fund, are being watched andcriticised abroad,   There are already signs that London islosing the confidence of foreign markets and it is believed thatthere is a steady trickle of money being transferred from thiscountry abroad,   Ye cannot afford to let this movement increase*Our prosperity is largely based on the predominant positionwe hold in finance, as a result of which we have attracted,and hold, very large foreign balancestt   The precise amount ofthose balances is not known, but they certainly amount to severalhundreds of millions of pounds sterling;  andsbesides thesebalances, there are foreign investments in sterling securities of an equal or possibly even greater amount.   /ny flight fromthe pound would be fraught with the most disastrous consequencesnot merely to the money market but to the whole economic organisation of the country   It is imperative to take stepsto counteract this tendency, and to reassure the world as toour positions,   It is not merely that we cannot afford the
-jdraiiT of-&apos;- -g61d whictua withdrawal of br.-Lo.nces - would, entails   Beyond&apos; this  it  is  the  hope  of this  Government  that means vd.ll be found to promote  a re-examination of  monetary policy throughout the world and thus to secure  a greater degree of  co-operation in regard to the management  of credit and the utilisation of the available supply of gold.  It  will be an ill day when any initiative taken from  London on  these grave questions is met with the  rejoinder that  our first  business is to put our own house in order*   But there are indications that,  unless active steps are taken to remedy the  admitted defects  of our financial position, that is the rejoinder with  which we will inevitably be faced0      50  Ehat.  then, must be done to meet the  situation?  In the present  grave conditions no  easier or more certain method could be devised  for damping down hopes of a revival of business confidence than  to  make  a  second increase in the Income Tax within the space of  a  twelve months,    The same consideration applies in hardly less  degree to  Super-tax and Death Dutiesi  moreover, both these duties have now reached such a high level that the Exchequer may. well  lose as  much by Increased evasion  as it would gain from raising  the rates0    In these circumstances it is abundantly clear that  it  is  the  Expenditure side of the  account to which we must devote our  principal attention.;,   It is not enough now to refrain from  undertaking fresh expenditure0  Y/e must  secure  substantial reductions  in existing expenditure0  There is no recognition of this necessity  in the Estimates already submitted,,   On the contrary the Civil Estimates  show a large increase, mainly due to the alarming increase of the Exchequer charge for  Transitional Benefit and to  the steady growth of Education expenditure  which has risen by over   10 millions since 1924.   A brief note on the Civil Estimates is  attached in  an Appendix.    I understand that large demands are likely to be  made upon the Exchequer for assistance to the Road Fund in  1951  in  connexion with current unemployment programmes.   The Defence  Estimates promise at best to be stationary, as compared with the present -year.   &apos;7e were  expected to effect great  reductions of  these services.    I shall do my utmost to obtain them,,   But they pill  require  important decisions of policy in
order- to reduce the obligations at present laid upon &quot;&quot;theFighting Services and the size of the forces maintained togive effect to them.   I shall ash my colleagues at an earlydate to consider these matters;  In the meantime I am bound to admit that, whatever reductions it may be possible to secureon Defence Estimates in future years, no such substantialrelief as I require in the coming year can be expected underthis head,     6:0   It may be ashed whether the estimate given for 1931is not too pessimistic on the ground that if a revival oftrade comes quickly it will transform the national balance-sheet at once.   It is true that, if we could hope for thisearly revival, it wou3.d help the Budget to some extent - butnot at all to the extent that might be supposed,,   The IncomeTax charge is based upon the profits of the preceding year:the charge for 1931 depends upon the profits of 1930 which for good or ill  are settled now.   The Super-tax  is  in similarcase,,   Nor will an early revival of trade bring  immediaterelief of any appreciable amount from the burden  of  expenditure.-Even the vast cost of transitional benefit, the figure whichis chiefly responsible for the Budget chaos, will not be largely affected at the outset when prosperity returns.   the workpeople entitled to this payment - those who have not thirtycontributions in two years - are on the average those who ifthey are ever ro-abcorbed will be re-absorbed most slowly ofall, and in the  meanwhile it is  an arithmetical consequence ofthe nature of the test for transitional benefit that, as the -period of  the depression lengthens, the number of claimantscontinually grows.   A long time must in  any case pass beforethe Exchequer could get sensible relief from the  burden of transitional benefit  if it is  to continue in its  existing form.     7.    There  is  another aspect  of Budget finance  which gives  ground  for great  anxiety  and  shows  that we  cannot riskallowing  things  to  slide.   w&quot;e  are passing through a period
marked by an extraordinarily rapid fall in prices.   wholesale prices have fallen over 20 per cent. in the last twelve months&apos;and even the retail cost of living by nearly 8 per cent;  andfalling prices have been accompanied by a vast dislocation oftrade from which every country in the world is suffering.  Pricescannot go on failing for ever, and sooner or later, perhapsquite soon, the fall will be checked and there will be asubstantial recovery of trade and industry.       But it is an entire mistake to suppose that, even when we have got through the present depression, recovery by itself.1s going to cure the Budget troubles of Great Britain and othercountries.    The physical volume of trade may well be restored towhat it was before the great slump&apos;-, began in the Autumn of 1929,but it will nevertheless be carried on at a definitely lower level of prices.   If we cannot increase further the rate oftaxation  (and the formidable difficulties in that  direction havebeen mentioned already)  we must look forward to a reduced revenuein future years, and to balance Budgets there must be reducedexpenditure.       Expenditure will not drop of its own accord; indeed itis astonishing how very little there is of our  State expenditure which can be expected to respond automatically  to  falling prices.The great bulk of  our expenditure is made up of such items asdebt  interest, old  age  and widows&apos;pensions, war pensions, fixedderating and housing grants, pay and pensions of the Army, navy and Civil Servants, grants towards .the  expense  of  school teachers and police  etc.;  with  very few  exceptions, such as Civil Servicesalaries  and pensions  (which respond to falling prices  throughthe cost  of  living  element), all these  heads of expenditure are fixed money  charges which a drop  in the price level does not reduce.
   8.     So far from there being any prospect of anet decline of expenditure under present conditions,there is every reason to anticipate that there willbe a heavy Increase.   Looking beyond next year andcomparing the original Civil Supply estimates of 1950with a forecast of our probable Civil Supply expenditurein 1934, I find that tho following increases areanticipated.   Agriculture             -f    2o3 millions (including                                        1.8 m0  for Land                                       end Marketing BillSo)   Education                   17.3 millions (including                                       . 6-3 for School                                       Leaving Ages.)   Old Age Pensions        -v    5c 1 millions   Widows&apos; Pensions        *    4.0 millions   Housing                 +    2.7 millions   Block grants            -t-     .9 millions                   f   Other Civil Estimates   +    204 millions                           -v   35.2 millionsAgainst this the only savings in prospect are  6.7 millions on War Pensions and  5c5 millions on the Beet SugarSubsidy, supposing the latter to be abolished by 1934 inaccordance with present plans.   9.      Nothing has been included in this table in respectof Unemployment Insurance, for the reason that no real estimatecan be made.   But It will need courageous action if in1934 the charge is to be less than was included in theoriginal estimates for 1930, viz:   25.5 millions, of which 10.5  millions was for Transitional Benefit.    Among the many serious questions to which I have referred I must ask my colleagues to give immediate and earnest consideration
43to  this issue.   On financial  grounds  alone  it  is  such  asto  give rise  to  the greatest anxiety.    Over and above  thenormal cost of the State  contribution  to UnemploymentInsurance,,, which is nearly  16 millions per  annum, over&apos;and.above the borrowings  for the  Fund, which are now at separately  in the region of   4-0 millions a year. transitional benefit (estimated a year ago  to  cost  the Exchequer 10i  millions in 19 50  and actually costing  22  millions in  that year) is now estimated to cost at least  30 millions in  1951, and  there is  still no assurance that we have yetheard the worst.   It  is  this  liability which has upset the balance of this year&apos;s Budget and  it is  the maincause of the  difficulties with which I am faced, next year.If  stern measures are  not taken quickly to free theExchequer from this burden, it threatens grave  danger tothe economic  and. financial stability of the  country.

The Provisional Total- is  520.5 millions showing an increase on Budget Estimates 1930 of  24.2 millions.           Excluding War Pensions ( 50. 3 in.) and administrative and minor services (&quot;24.6 m. in all), Civil Estimates may conveniently be grouped under two heads, vis :-                             1931 Estimates.

          The annexed table gives an analysis of the items which mal.ce up these groups,,   The actual expenditure for eachitem in 19.84 has &quot;been added in order to show the growth ofexpenditure during the last seven years   I.     Under the heading of Grants for Local Services themain cause of the great increase between 1924 and 1930 hasof course been the Derating scheme which has involved alarge transfer of expenditure from the ratepayer to thetaxpayero   Nothing short of a reversal of the Local government act 1929 could secure retrenchment under this heads   Thereis also a steady growth of expenditure on Housing subsidies and Education.   The former could only be checked by repeal of the Housing Acts: even then the existing expenditure would necessarily continue for many years.   Education grantshave shown, and will continue under present policy  to show,a formidable growth.   The increase between 1924 and 1931 hasbeen   10-g- millions owing mainly to the &quot;re-organisation&quot; ofelementary education which has been going on for some yearsend to the extension of secondary education.   For the samereasons and as a result of the raising of the school agethere is expected to be a further increase of  13 millions in the next three years   Approximately two-thirds of thetotal Education grants of  57 millions are for Teachers&apos;salaries end no substantial economy could be securedimmediately without their reduction.x   Of this sum about  1*4 millions is not a real increasebut an accounting transfer from the Consolidated Fund to civil Estimates.
o&apos;    II.    Expenditure on  Social  Services has more than doubled since 1924.   Of  the  increase, amounting to  55 millions 9  23 millions are  attributable to the normal growth of the cost of  Old Age Pensions and to the additional  expenditure caused by the Widows&apos; and Old Age Contributory Pensions Acts of 1925 and 1929. The remainder,  apart from the restoration of the ordinary Exchequer contribution  to the Unemployment Insurance Fund  to an &quot;equal third&quot;9 is due to Transitional Benefit.   As already indicated in the general memorandum, it is this liability which Is mainly responsible for the impending deficit for the current year and Which threatens the equilibrium of the Budget of 1931.    It should be pointed out that in the absence  of fresh legislation Transitional benefit expires during the year  beginning next April. If it is not prolonged, the cost of the Exchequer might not be more than  15 millions in that year. The estimate of  30 millions  is  based, on the assumption that it will be continued at  the existing rates throughout the year:    on this assumption it must be realised that the figure may be an under-estimate and that, if there is no  early improvement of trade, the cost may well amount  to as much as  35 millions.          Apart from relief from this liability the only means of securing my large and immediate reduction of this group of expenditure would be the reduction ofPension rates.                            -IP-
