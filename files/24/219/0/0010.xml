CABINET.                  THE INDIA ROUND TABLE CONFERENCE.              DRAFT STATEMENT BY HIS MAJESTY&apos;S GOvTSPJflMENT.              (Circulated by direction of the Prime Minister).                  The view of His Majesty&apos;s Government is that           responsibility for the government of India should be           placed upon legislatures, Central ana Provincial,           with such immediate provisions as may be necessary to           guarantee, during a period of transition, the obser-           vance of certain obligations and to meet other special           circumstances as may be agreed upons   In such statutory           provision as may be made for meeting the needs of the           transitional period, it will be a primary concern of           His Majesty&apos;s Government to see that the reserved powers           are so framed and exercised as not to prejudice the           advance of India through the new Constitution to full           responsibility for her own government.              2.   His Majesty&apos;s Government have taken note of the           fact that the deliberations of the Conference have pro- .           ceeded on the basis, accepted&quot;by all parties, that the           Central Government should be a Federation of all-India,           embracing both the Indian States and British India and           composed of two Houses and an executive.    The precise           form.and structure of the new Federal Government must           be determined after further discussion with the Princes           and the representatives of British India.   The range           of subjects to be committed to it will also require           further discussion,  because the Federal Government will
                                                      0 9have authority- cnly-in. such, matters concerning theStates as will &quot;be ceded by their rulers in agreements&apos;made &quot;by them on entering into federation.   With aLegislature so constituted;, His Majesty1 s Governmentwill he prepared to recognize the principle of theunited responsibility of the Executive to the Legis-lature, and apply the principle in accordance with thearrangement for the distribution of Federal powers.       During the transitional period.,, the subjects ofDefence and External Affairs will he reserved to theGovernor General, and arrangements will he made toenable him to exercise those powers.   In all othermatters, the Ministry will be responsible.   Moreover,as the Governor-General must as a last resort be able in an emergency to  maintain the tranquillity of theState^ and must similarly be responsible for the ob-servation of the constitutional rights of Minorities,he must be granted  the necessary powers  to do so.His Majesty&apos;s Government also contemplate that duringthe period when the Constitution is settling intoworking order, Indian finance will require special careso that credit and  confidence are maintained and whilstnot undoing the financial responsibility of the indian government, it will propose an agreement on thesematters, ensuring that the Government will meet itscontracted obligations and enabling it by its financial policy to enjoy as  before a.favourable access to themoney markets of the world.       This will mean that as regards the central legislature and Executive there will be  some features of dualism during the transition period,  and this  willhave to be fitted into the constitutional structure.It may also be necessary, to help  the Executive to carry
out responsibilities imposed upon it as a jointly-responsible body and prevent it from falling backupon the reserved powers of the Governor Generaland thus defeat the development of responsible government by bringing into use powers meant to lie in reserve in the background, to give it stability&quot;by making its removal subject, say, to some propor-tion of the votes of both Houses.   Though the pro-vision of these reserve powers is necessary and isinherent in all free constitutions, every care mustbe taken to prevent conditions arising which will necessitate their use.   3.   The Governor&apos;s provinces will be constitutedon a basis of full responsibility,   Their Ministrieswill be taken from the Legislature and will bejointly responsible to it.   The range of Provincialsubjects will be so defined as to give them the fullest possible measure of self-government, and the authorityof the Federal Government will be 3-imited to provisionsrequired to safeguard its administration of Federalsubjects, and to discharge its responsibility for cer-tain matters not falling within  the Federal sphere,but defined in the constitution  as of all-India concern.         There will be reserved  to the Governor inaddition to the normal powers  implied in the structureabove outlined, and subject to the intentions referredto in the case of the Governor General, only that minimum of special powers which is required in order to secure.,in exceptional circumstances,  the preservation of tran-quiliity, and to guarantee the maintenance  of rightsprovided by Statute for the Public Services.
     4.   Finally, His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that theinstitution in the provinces of a system of responsible andtherefore more popular government requires both that the Legis-Legislatures should &quot;be enlarged, and that they should he based on amore liberal franchise.     5.   In granting this Constitution, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment considers it to be its duty to insert provisionsguaranteeing that the various minorities shall not be penalisedon the ground of religious, racial, sect, or caste differences.     6.   The various Sub-Committees which have been studying the more important principles of a Constitution v/hich would meet Indian conditions, have surveyed a considerable part ofthe structure in detail and the still unsettled points havebeen advanced a good way to an agreement.   His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, however, in view of  the character of the  Conference andof the shortness of time at its disposal in London, have deemedit advisable to suspend its work at this point, so that indian opinion may be consulted upon this declaration of intention onits part, and that the necessary opportunity both here  and inIndia may be given for the parties concerned to consider how theycan co-operate to draft the contemplated constitution and prepare for its working,   It  is therefore proposed that the Viceroy shallwithout delay take such steps  as he may .deem advisable  to continuethese negotiations and keep this Conference in being.   Its members might  in the meantime become the authorised spokesmen of thevarious sections  to which  they belong, and if others wish to co-operate on the general lines of  this  declaration, steps might betaken  to secure their  inclusion.   On their part His Majesty&apos;sGovernment will,  in the light  of the  opinions expressed at this conference,  study the  details  of the  problem and devise, inco-operation with the  Viceroy and the  deliberations which hewill  conduct, means for giving effect to  this declaration.   It is
anprobable that when this work has been done, a finalConference will have to be held to secure such an amountof agreement as will enable the ne?/ Constitution to be7passed through the British Parliament with the virtualassent of  all parties, and to be put into  operation inIndia with the active  and co-operating goodwill of its people.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.
