  THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.I-----------iUV)UPrmieti for the &quot;Caovri^i-  February 1931.hiSECRET.                                                   Copy No.     5CP.  26 (31).ijmr-ii^                         CABINET.THE DISARMAMENT  CONFERENCE.     &quot;MEMORANDUM  BY THE  SECRETARY OF STATE  FOR  FOREIGN  AFFAIRS.    WHATEVER  may  be  the  intrinsic technical  value of  the PreparatoryCommission^ draft  convention, there can be no doubt that the completion of that5draft constitutes a political fact of the highest importance.  We have come to an endof one chapter, and the next is opened.    2.   Everyone is  agreed that the coming Disarmament  Conference will be only a first step, as it may be difficult, for various reasons, to secure, at the first Conference,any very substantial reduction.                                           &apos;  .    ;3.   The  German Government have repeatedly said, through their representa-tives at Geneva, that they insist on a real reduction, in the absence of which they will consider that the other Governments have broken their  pledges, and, in such a case,Germany will  consider herself freed from her  own obligations  in the matter  of disarmament.    4.   If  such a situation should arise, it is obvious that a major crisis will  beproduced, and  the question, therefore, apart from its purely technical aspects, hasthe gravest political implications.  It is consequently of great importance on general political grounds that we should secure the largest reductions for which agreement can be obtained.    5.   The  Council of the League   of  Nations  has  now   decided  that theDisarmament Conference shall assemble at Geneva at the beginning of February  of next year.  That should leave enough time, but  not too much, for the preliminarystudies and exchanges of views that are necessary before the Conference can meet with any prospect of success.    6.   Some Governments  had conceived the plan that the Council, at its recentsession,  should appoint the President of the  Conference, and  perhaps two Vice-Presidents, and that these three officers should be entrusted forthwith with the work.of preliminary investigation  and negotiation.  That  plan has  met with strong-opposition.  Its opponents gave prominence to the argument that good results wouldbe dependent,  in the last analysis, on  agreement between  the principal  Powers;that these must embark on a direct exchange of views,  and that  there was no needfor &quot; intermediaries.&quot;    7.   The Council  has decided that the Secretary-General of the League shall  bein charge of the preliminary work. It is, therefore,  all the more  incumbent on theBritish and other Governments to assist the Secretary-General by pushing on  atonce with their preparations, so that they may be ready at the earliest possible date to furnish all information necessary for a survey of the position.    8.   Great  Britain must have, and will be expected to have,  a rather decisivevoice in the negotiations,  and her authority would be  enormously enhanced if herrepresentatives could speak for  the  country as  a whole.  Earnest consideration      [5006]
should, therefore, be given ta the desirability bf inviting the&apos;t\vb Opposition Partiesto take  part in the work of  the  Conference,  and to bear their  share  in theresponsibility from the beginning.   The inclusion&apos; of representatives of all parties in the British Delegation would, I am sure, have a profound effect abroad.   More-over,  the decisions which w$ shall have to take  and  the results of the comingnegotiations  may intimately effect the course, of  foreign politics for years to come,and it would, therefore, be only appropriate that all parties should be associated in them.                                                                       j    9.  I suggest that a Committee of the Cabinet be immediately appointed to direct the work.  If the recommendation in the preceding paragraph is adopted, Iwould advise that representatives of the other Parties should be associated with thisCommittee.   If  those Parties are to be asked to take a share of the responsibility,they should,  in my opinion, be given the fullest opportunity of advice, consultation and papers, the  Committee would itself make suggestions and give directions for thework  that is  to be done.    10.  We shall have to determine the figures that we propose to insert into theConvention.  This will not be an easy task, as the decisions must depend on a numberof factors which will require very careful consideration, and we must obtain some idea of the sort  of figures that we should like to see adopted by the other principalcountries.    11.  The Committee could discuss  with the  Service Departments the  best methods  for carrying out this  work as it affects each of them, and for reviewing andco-ordinating the results.    12.  Representatives of all the European countries are due to meet at Genevaearly  in May, and  it would, therefore, be very desirable that we should by  then have formed some  idea of our intentions, and we should press them to come to that meetingsimilarly prepared, so that a first exchange of views might then be possible.  Thereis not too much time left to us if we are to achieve this.                                                       (Initialled)      A. H.    Foreign  Officle, Jamiary 31, 1931.
