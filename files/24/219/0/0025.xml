NOTE BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS.    I CIRCULATE to  the Cabinet the draft of a letter to be addressed to  theJewish Agency (Appendix), which has been agreed upon between representatives ofthe Agency and the Committee appointed by the Cabinet on the 6th November, 1930,*to consider the situation in Palestine arising out  of the&apos; publication of the white paper of October last.    In accepting this exposition of the policy of  His Majesty&apos;s Government, andexpressing his thanks for  the result which has been achieved,  Dr. Weizman,  onbehalf of the Jewish representatives, has put forward the request that the Committeewould submit  to the  Cabinet the desirability of extending the terms of reference ofthe Committee with a view to the discussion with representatives of the jewish agency of the following  further questions:     1.  Development Commission.           Composition.   Powers.  Functions and Finance.    2.  Trans jordan.           Possibility of operation of Development Commission  in  Trans Jordan.               Status of Jews in Transjordan in accordance with the Mandate.    3.  Legislative Council.           Conditions for establishment of.    4. Status of Jewish Agency in relation to administration.    If there is to be any extension of the terms of reference  of the Committee inaccordance with the wishes of the Jewish  Agency, it must, in my opinion, be laiddown quite clearly that the Committee cannot be made in any way responsible forthe day-to-day administration of Palestine. Further consideration of this problem by the Committee as at present constituted, under my Chairmanship, will in any caseinvolve claims upon time  which I can ill afford to spare, having regard to the presentdifficult  European situation and with the  Disarmament  Conference and  other important matters requiring my urgent attention.    As regards the letter to be addressed to the  Jewish Agency,  the Committee are disposed to think that if the Cabinet concur in-its terms, it might be desirable forthe Prime Minister to sign the letter as the head of the Government.

APPENDIX.                   DRAFT COPY OF LETTER TO DR.  WEIZMAN/,.^&apos; Dear Dr. Weizinanjv,                              10, Downing Street, S-W.1.     IN order to remove certain misconceptions and misunderstandings which have arisen as to the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government with regard to Palestine, as set forth in the White Paper of October 1930, and which were the subject of a Debate in the House of Commons on the 17th November, and also to meet certain criticisms put forward by the Jewish Agency, I have pleasure in forwarding you the following- statement  of  our  position,  which will  fall  to be  read as  the  authoritative interpretation of the White Paper on the matters with which this letter deals.     2.   It has  been  said that the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government involves a serious departure from the obligations of the Mandate  as hitherto understood, that it misconceives the Mandatory obligations, and that it  foreshadows a policy which is inconsistent with the obligations of the Mandatory to the Jewish people.     3.   His Majesty&apos;s Government did not regard it as necessary to quote in extenso the declarations of policy which have been previously made, but attention is drawn to the fact that, not only  does the White Paper of 1930 refer  to and endorse the White Paper of 1922, which has been accepted by the Jewish  Agency,  but  it recognises  that  the undertaking of the  Mandate is an undertaking  to the Jewish people and not only to the Jewish population of Palestine.   The White  Paper placed in the foreground of its statement  K^p-speech ma4e-by the^Pgime M-tnist r in  the House of Commons on the 3rd April, 1930,  in which fes, announced in words which could  not have been made more plain, that it was the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to continue to administer Palestine in accordance with theterms of the Mandate as approved by the Council of the League of Nations.   That position  has been  reaffirmed  and again made  plain by t4$^speech  of  tho  Prime Ilkast-&quot;- in the Hous%of Commons on  the 17th November.   In Vlk&amp; speech on the3rd April the T3:^^,])^^^,^ used the following language :        f         &quot; His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  will  continue to administer  Palestine in    accordance  with  the terms of the Mandate as approved by the Council of the    League of  Nations.   This is an international obligation from which there can    be no question of receding.         &quot; Under  the terms  of  the  Mandate  His  Majesty&apos;s Government are    responsible for promoting the  establishment of a National Home for the Jewish    people, it  being  clearly  understood that nothing  shall be  done  which might    prejudice the civil  and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in    Palestine or the rights  and  political  status  enjoyed  by  Jews in  any  other    country.         &quot;A double undertaking is involved, to the Jewish people on the one hand,    and  to the non-Jewish population of Palestine on the  other; and it is the firm    resolve of His  Majesty&apos;s Government to give effect, in equal measures,  to both    parts of the Declaration, and to do equal justice to all sections of the population    of Palestine.  That is a duty from which they will not  shrink, and  to the    discharge of which they will apply all the resources at their command.&quot;    That declaration is in conformity not only with the articles, but also with the preamble of the Mandate,  which isThereby explicitly reaffirmed.    4.  In carrying out the policy of the Mandate the Mandatory cannot ignore the existence of differing interests and viewpoints.  These, indeed,&apos; are not in themselves irreconcilable, but they can only be reconciled  if there  is a proper realisation that the full solution of  the problem depends on an understanding between the Jews and the Arabs.  Until that is reached, considerations of balance must inevitably enter into the definition of policy.    5.  A good deal of criticism  has  been directed to the White Paper upon the assertion that  it contains injurious allegations  against  the  Jewish people and Jewish Labour  Organization.&quot; Any such intention on the part of His Majesty&apos;s
P i 1 Government is expressly disavowed.  It is recognised that the Jewish Agency have all along given willing co-operation in carrying out the policy of the Mandate, and that the constructive work done by the Jewish people in Palestine has had beneficial effects on the development and well-being of the country as a whole.  His Majesty&apos;s Government also  recognise the value of the services of labour and trades union organization in Palestine, to which they desire to give every encouragement.     6.   A question has arisen as to the meaning to be attached to the words &quot; safe- guarding the civil and religious rights of all inhabitants of Palestine, irrespective of  race  and religion,&quot; occurring in article 2,  and the words  &quot;ensuring that the rights and position of  other  sections of  the population  are not prejudiced,&quot; occurring in article 6 of  the Mandate.  The words &quot; safeguarding the civil and religious rights,&quot; occurring in article 2, cannot be read as meaning that the civil and religious rights of individual citizens are to be unalterable.   In the case of Suleiman Murra, to which reference has been made, the Privy Council,  in  construing  these words of article 2, said :  &quot; It does not mean ....  that all the civil rights of every inhabitant of Palestine  which  existed at the date of the Mandate are  to  remain unaltered throughout its duration; for if this were  to  be a condition  of the Mandatory  jurisdiction,  no effective legislation would be possible.&quot;  The words, accordingly, must be read in another sense, and the key to the true purpose and meaning of the sentence is to be  found in the concluding words of  the article: &quot; Irrespective of race and religion.&quot;   These words indicate  that, in respect  of civil and; religious rights, the  Mandatory is not to discriminate between  persons on the ground of religion or race, and this protective provision applies  equally to Jews, Arabs, and all sections of the population.     7.   The words *&apos; rights  and  position of  other  sections of  the population,&quot; occurring in article 6, plainly  refer to the non-Jewish community.  These rights and position are not to be prejudiced, that is, are not to be impaired or made worse. The effect of the policy of immigration and settlement on the economic position of the non-Jewish  community cannot  be excluded from consideration.   But the words are not to be read as implying  that existing economic conditions in Palestine should be  crystallised.   On the contrary,  the obligation to facilitate Jewish immigration and to encourage close settlement by Jews on the land, remains a positive obligation of the Mandate, and it can be  fulfilled without  prejudice to  the rights and position of other sections of the population of Palestine.     8.   We may proceed to the contention that the Mandate has been reinterpreted in  a  manner highly prejudicial to Jewish  interests in the vital  matters of land settlement and immigration.   It has been said  that the policy of the White Paper would place an embargo  upon immigration, and  would suspend, if  not,  indeed, terminate, the close settlement of the Jews on the land, which is a primary purpose of the Mandate.  In support of this contention particular stress has been laid upon the passage referring to State lands in the White Paper, which says that &quot; it would not be possible to  make these areas available for Jewish settlement in view of their actual occupation by Arab cultivators, and of the importance of making available additional land on which to place the Arab cultivators who are now landless.&quot;     9.   The language of this passage needs to  be read in the light of the policy  as a whole.  It is desirable to make  it&apos;clear that the landless Arabs to whom it was intended to refer  in the passage quoted, were .such Arabs as can be shown  to have been  displaced from the lands which they occupgHn consequence of the lands  passing into  Jewish hands, and who have not obtained other holdings on which they can establish themselves or other equally satisfactory occupation.  The number  of such displaced Arabs must be a matter  for careful enquiry. JttiSjto landless Arabs within this category that His Majesty&apos;s Government feefyTQ^SJ&amp;ffi&amp;eT an obligation to  facilitate their  settlement upon the land.  The recogBiTion of this obligation  in no way detracts  from the larger purposes  of -ewfewsta^  development,  which His JM^estVs^Goyernment  regards- as  the  most  effectual means  of furthering the^*eimbTisnment of&quot;a^Home for the Jews.      10.   In framing a policy of land settlement, it is essential that His Majesty&apos;s Government should take into  consideration every circumstance that is relevant  to the main purposes of the Mandate.  The area of cultivable land, the possibilities  of irrigation, the absorptive  capacity of the country in relation to immigration are all        [22354]                                                        B 2
elements pertinent to the issues to be elucidated, and the neglect of any one of them would be prejudicial to the formulation of a just and stable policy.     It is the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to institute an enquiry as soonas possible to ascertain,  inter alia, what State and other lands  are, or properly canbe made,  available for close settlement by Jews under reference to the obligationimposed upon the Mandatory  by article 6 of the Mandate.  This enquiry will becomprehensive in its  scope, and will include the whole land resources of Palestine.In the conduct of the enquiry provision will be made for all interests, whether Jewishor Arab, making such representations as it may be desired to put forward.     11.   The  question of the  congestion amongst the fellahin in the hill districts of Palestine is receiving the careful consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government.It is contemplated that measures will be devised for the improvement and intensivedevelopment of the land,  and for bringing into cultivation areas which hithertomay have remained  uncultivated, and thereby  securing- to the fellahin  a betterstandard of living, without  save in exceptional cases having recourse to transfer.     12.   In giving effect to  the  policy  of  land  settlement,  as  contemplated inarticle 11 of the Mandate, it is necessary, if disorganisation is to be avoided, andif the policy is to have a chance to succeed, that there should exist some centralisedcontrol  of transactions  relating to the acquisition and  transfer  of land duringsuch interim period as may reasonably be necessary to place the development schemeupon a sure foundation.   The power contemplated is regulative and not prohibitory,although it does involve a power to prevent transactions which are inconsistent withthe  tenor  of  the scheme.   But  the  exercise  of the power will  be limited  andin no respect arbitrary.  In every case it will be conditioned by considerations asto how best to give effect to the purposes of the Mandate.  Any control contemplatedwill be fenced with clue safeguards to secure as little interference as possible withthe free transfer of land. The centralised control will take effect as from such dateonly as the authority charged with the duty of carrying out the policy of landdevelopment   shall begin to operate.    The High Commissioner shall,  pending theestablishment of such centralised  control, have full powers to take all steps necessaryto protect the.tenancy  and  occupancy  rights, including the rights of squatters,throughout Palestine.     13.  Further, the statement of  policy of His  Majesty&apos;s  Government did not imply a prohibition of acquisition of additional land by Jews.  It contains no suchprohibition, nor is any such intended.  What it does contemplate is such temporarycontrol of  land disposition and  transfers as may be necessary, not to impair theharmony and  effectiveness of the scheme of land settlement to be undertaken.  HisMajesty&apos;s Government feel bound to point out that they alone of  the governments which have been responsible for the administration of Palestine since the acceptanceof the mandate  have declared their definite intention to initiate an active policyof development which it is  believed will  result in substantial  and lasting  benefitto both Jews and Arabs.     14.  Cognate to  this question is the control of Immigration.   It must, first ofall, be pointed out that  such control is not in any sense a departure from previouspolicy.   From 1920 onwards, when the original Immigration Ordinance came intoforce, regulations for the control of Immigration have been issued from time to time,directed to prevent illicit entry and to define and facilitate authorised entry.  this right of regulation has at no time been challenged.     15.  But the intention  of His  Majesty&apos;s Government appears  to have been represented as being  that &quot; no further immigration of Jews is to be permitted solong as it might prevent any  Arab  from  obtaining employment.&quot;  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment never proposed to pursue such a policy.  They  were concerned to statethat, in the  regulation of Jewish  immigration,  the  following principles  should apply, viz., that &quot;it  is essential  to ensure that the immigrants should not be a burden upon the people of Palestine as a whole,  and that they should  not depriveany section of the present population of their employment &quot; (White Paper, 1922).In the one aspect His Majesty&apos;s Government have to be mindful of their obligations to facilitate Jewish Immigration under suitable conditions, and to encourage closesettlement of Jews on the land; in the other aspect  they have to be equally mindfulof their  duty to ensure  that no prejudice results to the rights and position of thenon-Jewish community.   It  is because of this apparent conflict of obligations that
His;Majesty&apos;s Government have felt: bound to emphasise the necessity of the properapplication of the absorptive capacity  principle.   That principle  is vital to any scheme of development, the primary purpose of which must be the  settlement both.of Jews and  of  displaced Arabs  upon  the land.    It  is for that reason that HisMajesty&apos;s Government have insisted, and  are compelled to  insist, that  government control of immigration must be maintained and that immigration regulations mustbe properly  applied.   The  considerations relevant  to the limits of absorptive capacity are purely economic  considerations.              ..  ,.  ;. .    16.   His Majesty&apos;s Government did not prescribe  and  do not contemplate anystoppage  or  prohibition of Jewish  immigration  in  any of its  categories.   Thepractice of sanctioning a &quot;Labour Schedule&quot; of wage-earning immigrants willcontinue.  In each case consideration will be given to anticipated  labour require-ments for  works  which, being dependent on Jewish or mainly Jewish capital, wouldnot be or would not have been undertaken  unless Jewish labour was  made available.With regard to  public and  municipal works  falling  to be financed out of public funds, the claim  of Jewish labour  to a due  share of the employment available, taking into account Jewish contributions to public revenue, shall be taken into consideration.As regards other kinds of employment, it will be necessary in each case to take infoaccount  the factors bearing  upon the demand for  labour,  including the factor  ofunemployment amongst both the Jews and the Arabs.   Immigrants with prospects of employment other than employment of  a purely ephemeral character will not  be excluded  on  the sole ground that the employment cannot  be guaranteed to  be  ofunlimited duration.    17.   In  determining  the extent to which Immigration at any time  may  be permitted, it is necessary  also to  have regard to the declared policy of the jewish agency  to the effect that in &quot; all the works or undertakings  carried out or furtheredby the Agency it shall be deemed to be a matter of principle that Jewish labour shallbe employed.&quot;   His  Majesty&apos;s  Government do not in any  way challenge the rightof the Agency to formulate  or  approve and endorse such a policy.   The principleof preferential  and, indeed, exclusive employment of Jewish labour by Jewishorganisations, is a principle which the Jewish Agency are entitled  to affirm.  Butit must be pointed out that if in consequence of this policy Arab labour is displacedor existing unemployment becomes aggravated, that is a factor in the situation  towhich the Mandatory is bound to have regard.    18.   His Majesty&apos;s Government desire to say finally,  as they have repeatedlyand unequivocally affirmed,  that  the obligations imposed upon the Mandatory,  by its acceptance of the Mandate, are  solemn international obligations,  from whichthere is not now, nor has there been at any time, an  intention to depart.  To the tasks imposed by the Mandate  His Majesty&apos;s  Government have set  their hand, andthey will not  withdraw it.  But if their efforts are to be successful there is need forco-operation,  confidence, readiness on all sides to appreciate  the  difficulties andcomplexities  of  the problem, and, above all, there must be a full  and  unqualifiedrecognition that no solution  can  be satisfactory or permanent which is not  basedupon justice, both to  the Jewish people  and to the  non-Jewish  communities  ofPalestine.
