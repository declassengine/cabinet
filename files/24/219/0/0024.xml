               THB HAIG  STATUS,,  Memorandum &quot;by  the  First.   omm i^          I regret to have  to trouble my colleagues for an .opinion on this matter,  which is  indeed a small thing in itselfbut happens to be  one of those little things which arouses thesentiment of the people  of  this country6          The question of the statue in memory of Sari Bafghas been one which seems to have been fated to surround itself with difficulties,,   It will be within the recollection of mycolleagues that the  resolution of Parliament praying HieMajesty to give directions for a monument to be erected toBar! Haig was only passed after a division in which most of usvoted in favour of an amendment to refer the matter to a select committee  The amendment was, however  lost and It fell to my predecessors,  fix*st of all Lord Peel and thenLord Londonderry9  to endeavour to give effect to the resolution.of the Commonsa          The nest difficulty arose as to the question of asite9 but, on the advice of the Royal Fine Art Commission, thelate Government decided  to over-rule the objections ofthe Westminster City Council to the site selected betweenthe Scottish Office and  the Royal United Services Institutionin the centre of Whitehall,,  A site having been selected,the next question  to be  settled was that of theeculptor0Normally, the practice of the department would have been tohave selected an artist  of established reputation toundertake the commission,,  My predecessors s however  feltthat public opinion was  in  favour of a Mja^fee-eb competition,                         1.

Lord Londonderry thereupon appointed Assessors todecide between the three models submitted.  As Chairman, heappointed Lord D^Abernon, a man of the world and anacknowledged amateur  of the arts,  and it is interesting to note that,  in inviting him to serve, Lord Londonderry statedthat he did so owing  to his knowledge of men and his knowledgeof horses,,  The  other members were nominated by the RoyalAcademy,  the National Gallery,  the Royal Institute  of BritishArchitects and  the  Royal  Society  of Sculptors  respectively9the nominees being  Sir William  Goscombe John,  R.A.,  the sculptor-  of the  Wolseley  statue,  Mr. Daniel,  the Director of the  National  Gallery, Sir Herbert Baker,  A..R.A. ,  the well-known Architect, and Mr.  Reynolds-Stephens,  the President
of the Royal Society of Sculptors.,  These gentlemen, whowere approved by the &quot;Ja te Prime Ministers selectedMr, HardimanBs model and he was accordingly commissioned to execute the statue;,          No sooner, however, did photographs of the modelappear in the Press than an outcry was raised,,  The strongestobjection was taken by the British Legion and by Lady Haig4The Assessors were accordingly summoned together and consulted as to what steps should be taken0          The sculptor9 Mrc Hardiman, was asked to appearbefore the Assessors and it was eventually suggested that heshould prepare a second and larger model,, in which he would endeavour to meet the criticisms levelled against his firstmodels  For this model he has been paid  500, and, whencompleted, it was considered by the same body of Assessors,,In the result, it was approved subject to certain minor modifications,,  The base of the statue,designed by an architectin collaboration-with Mr- Hardiman, v/as not, however, approved,,          It should also be mentioned  that, in order toassist the sculptor, arrangements were made with the WarOffice whereby he should have the advantage of consultingSir Noel Birch, Sir Walter Braithwaite and Sir Herbert Lawrenceall officers of experience and friends of the late  FieldMarshals  These officers, after minor  suggestions which theartist adopteds have likewise expressed themselves a3satisfied with the second model,,          In order to  enable Members of Parliament to form an opinion on the subject,,  the two models have recently been shown  to Members  of both Houses,  and photographs have been published in the Presse  I am bound,  to confess that, howeverill-info rated it may be,  the general  opinion of the man  inthe street appears to  be equally  hostile  to the  second modelas to  the first,
                                                          9 1 9                                                            i as to the  first,  and I  am afraid that it is never likely  to gain the support  of Lady Haig or the  British Legion0           Artistic  opinion2  a^d, I  may add, this  is my own opinion also, generally prefers  the first model to the second,, The  public  in general may perhaps he  said to prefer the figure of  the Earl  in the second model to the figure in the first, hut  the  figure of the  horse  is apparently  disliked almost as  much as  the  horse  in  the previous model9          Three courses of action appear to he open to me -      (1)  To hold an  entirely new competition^      (2)  To discontinue any  attempt  to erect a statue and            to  ask Parliament to sanction some other form of            memorialo      (3)  To instruct Mr.  Hardiman  to proceed with the full            sized statueB          I regard alternative (l)  as  hopeless.  The problem would be delayed for  some  years, but  there  is no guaranteewhatever that the fresh competition would result  in a more acceptable  statue.  Even if a sculptor were  selected withouta competition - a safer but less popular step - there would still be no guarantee that we should not eventually find ourselves v/ith another model, no more  acceptable to the publicthan the twe hitherto produced^          The second alternative  is one which may appeal tomany of my  colleagues 8 but I  fear might not he acceptable tothe ex- Ssrvlce opinion  in  the country.          I am inclined  to recommend  that the third alternativeshould be adopted at once, and.  In  doing so,  I am strengthenedin my belief by the fact  that in  addition to  the views of theAssessors and the Military Officers consulted. Sir D.Y.  Cameron
and Kr0 Macgillivary have written in glowing terms ofMrB Hardiman&apos;s talents0          If the first or second suggestions he adopted,compensations, possibly including substantial damages9 would %I feel, have to be paid to MrE Hardimans and  in any case,,the decision is bound to lead to considerable  criticism, andthis may lead to a debate in the House.,  Should thiseventually arise, I would suggest that the matter be left toa free vote of the House0Go LtmHaM.Office of v;orkSj, &amp;c0 30th January, 1931.,
