Qi ft &quot;4HIS DOCglENT Hi TH3 PROPERTY OF  HIS BRIT AM IG  MAJESTY &apos;S  GOVERNMENT.          Incident on board____H.M.S. LUCIA.      Memorandum by the Firs t I iO rd o f^ the Admi rg. 11 y.         The recent incident on board H.M.S.LUCIA has attracted a good deal of public attention and questions areto be asked in the House of Commons.  I feel it desirable,therefore, to lay down before the Cabinet the statement which I propose  to make in the House In answer to questions on January 28th.    It has been foreshadowed that therewill be some demand for a judicial enquiry Into the procedureinvolved, but I am satisfied that such an enquiry at thepresent juncture is not necessary.   The  regulations were amended in March, 1929, and are working wo 11, except that Insome cases they do not appear to have been sufficientlybrought to the notice of those concerned.   The Board ofAdmiralty are taking steps to ensure that there can be noexcuse in future of ignorance In regard to these regulations.CP.21  (31)SECRET.CABINET.A.V.A.Admiralty, S.W.I.27th January,1931.
          The Board of Admiralty have nov/ had  the  opportunityof considering tho Minutes  of the  Court of Inquiry held  to investigate the recent incident in H.M.S. LUCIA and  theproceedings of the resultant Courts Martial.          The Board regret  that it must be concluded from themthat the conditions of contentment of the shiprs company and sympathy between  officers and men  which unquestionably exist in H.M. Ships generally were very  far from being realised in theLUCIA, and that this was due to some extent to went  of tact and consideration on  the part of the Captain and Executive officer and incapacity on the part  of the  Divisional Officer concerned.It is evident also that the Petty  Officers, who  should have beenm&amp;rs of a growing feeling  of discontent amongst the shipfscompany, took no  steps to check it or bring it  to  the notice oftheir officers, and further that there were certain  individualsamongst the shiprs company who fomented ill will amongst theirmessmates.          As a result of these unfortunate conditions, an order which was necessary to meet a Service.&apos;&apos;  urgency, which is by no                                    ( e&apos;mrjfmeans of unusual  occurrence in the K    i and which is ordinarilymet with cheerfulness by all concer&apos;&quot;   ./ was made the occasion                       v           i- ii... T /                            &apos;-&apos;&quot;-&apos;.&apos;&apos;     *TlJ .of a concerted refusal of duty by &apos;a b jdy of men, - anunprecodontcd action, which whateverJthe supposed  provocation,cannot be treated otherwise than gravely in a  Service whosewhole existence and purpose depend upon implicit obedience toorders.          The Board, however., having given full weight to theextenuating circumstances already  mentioned, have  decided toreduce the punishments awarded by  the Courts by substitutingfor the sentence  of imprisonment with hard labour  that of detention in the  two cases  in which the former punishment wasawarded, and also reducing  the period of detention by one-third
9 fl 9in all the four cases.  Corresponding reductions have also&quot;been made in the summary punishments.          The officers referred to will have their appointmentsterminated forthwith and will be placed on half pay, with an expression of the Board&apos;a serious displeasure for theregrettable state of affairs revealed by this incident, and h.M.S.LUCIA will be immediately paid off and recommissionedwith a new crew of officers and men.          The Board have also carefully considered whether the                          incidentfacts in connection with this/point to the desirability&amp;  any alteration of the new Regulations Issued, in 1929 on thesubject of the procedure for preferring complaints, and havedecided that there is no ground for thinking that theRegulations are in any way defective.  Some of the evidence,howevers showed that insufficient knowledge of the Regulationsexisted both amongst officers and men, and in order to safe-guard the position further, steps will be taken to ensure,as far as may be, that no officer or man shall be unaware ofthe proper procedure.  It may be observed, as evidence of thefact that this procedure is not generally misunderstood thatapplications for redress forwarded to the Admiralty throughthe Commanding Officer and the Commander-in-Chief are fromtime to time received.
