DOCUMENT IS  THE  PROPERTY  OF  HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;B  GOVERNMENT.                                                              I                                                  Copy  No.^_\(31).                        CABINET.                 PUBLICATION OF  THE IRON AND STEEL REPORT.             Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.     My colleagues will remember that it was decided(Cabinet 46 (50) Conclusion 14) that the Report of the Sub-Committee of the Eoonomic Advisory Council on the Iron andSteel Industry should not be published.  This decision was inaccordance with the recommendation of the Eoonomic AdvisoryCouncil made at their meeting on June 19th, 1950  (E.A.O.5th Meeting).     Since that date there hac been a considerable amount of pressure to publish the Report, though we have had nodifficulty in resisting the suggestion in the House ofCommons.  I have now received two letters from the NationalFederation of Iron e.nd Steel Manufacturers.  The  first, whichwas signed by Sir William Larke, was inspired by  the leakagein the &quot;Kolnische Zeitung&quot;, and said: &quot;In view of thisreport and the statements which you felt it necessary to makein connection with this matter, I feel, as representing theiron and steel industry, that  immediate publication hasnow become imperative&quot;.  It continued: &quot;As I stated at our first meeting, on June 24 last, and have consistentlyma^intadned ever since, the Steel industry has nothing to fearfrom the publication of the Report.  It seemed very desirable however that discussion between representatives ofthe industry and the Government should be conducted ifpossible in an  atmosphere free from the influence of public and political controversy on the difficulties of  the industry
                                                               -s- vj 4/          &quot;This is no longer possible In view  of the publication      in the Kolnische Zeitung  of  substantial extracts from the      report and their reproduction  in the British press.  Therefore      as representing the  industry I would urge the Government to      reconsider the decision and  publish the report  in  full      forthwith.&quot;          I attach a copy  of the  second letter in full,  and,  at      the request  of the Prime  Minister, submit the question  again      for consideration by my colleagues.          My own  view remains  unaltered.  Ho doubt the  report,      with certain modifications,  could  be published  without      violating any specific pledge  to keep  any particular evidence      secret.  Some further slight amendments might be necessary  in      order to avoid disclosing weaknesses in our industry to our      competitors. But the demand for publication  comes largely  froir      the protectionists,  and is certainly inspired by the hope      that the report will provide them  with ammunition. I do not      see why we should meet  their request,  more especially as it      involves come breach of the  general  rule, which I  am sure my      colleagues will  agree it  is  desirable  to  maintain, that the      Economic Advisory Council&apos;s  enquiries, when they  touch  on      larger  questions  of  policy,  should be  as  free  and  frank as      possible -  a condition  which it is normally impossible  to      reconcile with  publicity.                                            W.G.Board of Trade,     20th January, 1931.
NATIONAL FEDERATION OF IRON AND STEEL MANUFACTURERS,                            Oaxton House,                               Tothill Street,                                    Westminster,  S.W.1,felt Hobble.  W.  Graham,  M.P.,           18th Deoember,  1930.esident of the Board of  Trade,Dear Mr. Graham,                 Civil Research Report - Iron and                  Steel Industry.     With further reference to my letter of December 10th,the question of the publication of this Report came before  theExecutive Committee of this Federation this morning, and I  wasrequested by the Committee, in view of the publication ofextraots from the Report in the Kolnische Zeitung and-thevarious comments that have been made in public thereon, to  a3kyou to furnish sufficient copies so that each member of theExecutive Committee might have an opportunity of reading theReport.      The leaders of the industry are being placed in an embarrassing position as questions are continually being raisedby their Boards and they are unable to deal with them as theyhave not seen the Report In question.     The Executive Committee deeirei. me to say that they were quite prepared to suspend their  judgment as to the extent towhich general publication was desirable until they had had anopportunity of reading it.  They realise that I had to exercisemy personal judgment in the advice I have given you from time totime in the representations I have made, since I have been unableto eonsult the Executive Committee, by reason of the confidential nature of the document and the terms under which itwas communicated&apos;to Sir Peter Rylands and myself.     I had discussed the natter with Sir Peter Rylands and he has agreed in every step which I have taken.  The leaders of theindustry feel, however that they are being placed  at a greatdisadvantage, and that they ought at least to be given an equalopportunity which ether people have enjoyed in their capacitieseven though of a confidential character of perusing the Report.     If the Government decide not to publish the Report in theimmediate future, I should therefore be very grateful if I might be furnished with 50 copies;  in distributing thesecopies I will, if desired, report the name and address of the holder of each individual  copy provided they are numbered.                            Yours faithfully,(Sgd.)  W.J.  Larke.
