000 OJVCm^NTj.....IS LThE PROPERTY . OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.To                 CABINET.             ffULHAM POWER STATIONAJqinjLJy^SLSgg^^^of Works and the Minister of.JR^^gEQ^b.         The Cabinet will remember that in his Memorandum of the1st November last, C.P.37O (j50) regarding the Battersea power station, the proposals in which were approved &quot;by the Cabinet attheir Meeting of the 6th November, the Minister of Transportreferred to the intention of the Electricity Commissioners tohold a public Inquiry in the near future into the proposal ofthe Eulham Borough Council to extend their Power Station.   TheCommissioners have since held this Inquiry at which the LondonCounty Council and the Borough Councils of Westminster^Kensington and Chelsea made representations, and we are satisfiedfrom their Report which deals exhaustively with the matter fromall points of view, that in view of the estimated requirementsof electricity in the West London district in the next few years there is a clear case both on technical and financial grounds infavour of the proposed extension of the Eulhaia Power Station ascompared with any possible alternative arrangement.         The possibility of nuisance arising from the emissionof grit and dust will be obviated by the installation of moderndust extraction plant and also by arrangements for subsequentlypassing the gases through gas washing plant,   With a view to preventing injury from the emission of sulphur fumes, theEulham Borough Council propose to instal a washing apparatusbased on the elaboration of a plant known as &quot;The Modave&quot;apparatus and have agreed that in the event of this apparatusnot satisfying any tests required by the Commissioners, theywould instal apparatus on similar lines to that utilised in the
experiments of the London Power Company at the Grove RoadStation from which the Committee presided over by the GovernmentChemist, concluded that both flue gases and effluent could betreated practically so as to avoid a nuisance.         It is this last aspect of the matter which has given rise to most concern but we are satisfied as a result of our discussions that effective steps can be t aken to reduce theemission of sulphur fumes to a reasonable minimum and that theElectricity Commissioners and the Commissioners of Y/orks maysafely consent to the proposed extension of the Eulham power station, on the conditions specified in the Appendix to thisMemorandum as to which we are agreed subject to any points of drafting.   In addition to these formal conditions it is proposeto intimate to the Borough Council that the ElectricityCommissioners and the Commissioners of Y/orks will require thatthe method and apparatus employed is designed so that whentested after installation it will be capable of reducing thesulphur emission to  0o0j grains per cubic foot of flue gases,and that they may require the adoption of any improvement whichis found practicableo         An immediate decision on the Council&apos;s application isnecessary in view of the expiration of their option for thepurchase of certain land required for the proposed extension oftheir Power Station on the 20th of january    It is therefore proposed that the Electricity Commissioners&apos; consent should begiven forthwith to the extension on the conditions described above.   The report of the Inquiry will be published as soon aspossible and together with a statement of the conditions imposedshould, we think, suffice to satisfy reasonable opinion in theevent of criticism arising.         *..;e have, however, thought it desirable in thecircumstances to report the position for the information of theCabinet.                                (Intld.)    H.M.                                               9/1/31.
