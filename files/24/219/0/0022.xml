foCUMSNT  IS TEE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOv&quot;ERrTI EI&apos;TT.           PROPOSED SURCHARGE IN INDIAN COTTON                          DUTIES.    Memorandum &quot;by the President of the Board, of Trade.     In accordance with the decision of  the Cabinet  on     vWednesday last (Cabinet 10 (31) Conclusion 7), I have draftedthe attached telegram to be sent to the  Government of India.It is drafted as  a telegram from the Cabinet;   this was  theform of the telegram despatched  in February of last  year  on*-a similar occasion.  I have borne in mind  the possibilityof its publication.     I hope my colleagues will agree that  it  should  be despatched at once.ET,COPY NO.CAB I NET.V/.G.Board of Trade,50th January, 1931.
       Draft of the SUPstance of a telegram to go to the                     Indian Government,,     The Gabinet has had before it your telegrams of January14th and January 16th in which proposals are outlined for meeting the estimated deficit in the Indian Budget, and hasobserved with regret that it is regarded as necessary to imposecustoms surtaxes which will affect in greater or less degreepractically all exports from this country to India.     It is, however, to the question of the duties on cotton goods that the Cabinet feels it necessary to refer particularly.You will be aware from the correspondence that passed last yearhow seriously any increase in these duties is likely to beregarded here.  You will also be aware that since the dutieswere increased in India last year there has been a most seriousdecline in the trade between the two countries in cotton goods.Taking the eight months April to November, imports into india from the United Kingdom of grey goods have declined from 319million yards in 1929 to 129 millions In 1930;  bleached goods from 290 million yards to 172 millions and coloured goods from192 to 122 million yards.  Whilst there is no desire to attri-bute this decline wholly to the increase of duties last year, itcannot be doubted that the decline in trade would be aggravatodby any further increase in the duties, and that at a time when,as you no doubt know, the whole cotton trade of this country ispassing through an unexampled period of distress and depression.The Cabinet feels that it would be neglecting its duty if itfailed to make you aware of the disastrous impression that anysuch action on the part of your Government would create in thiscountry at the very moment when it is of the greatest politicalconsequence that good feeling should be promoted in every possible  way between the two countries.                              -1-
9 P &apos;f*m y u     The possible effect of this further increase  in the  costof living of the poorer classes in India has also  no doubt  notescaped your notice.     In all the circumstances the Cabinet would ask you togive the matter your further consideration before  reconmendinkto the Assembly proposals which must inevitably give rise hereto a feeling approaching consternation.     The Cabinet presumes that any change in the Indian oottonduties would not affect the operation of the existing arrange-ment by virtue of which higher duties are leviable on inportsfrom foreign countries than on imports from India.  If after full consideration of all the circumstances you still feel  it inevitable that increased revenue should be sought fromcustoms duties on cotton goods the Cabinet would be glad ifyou would at least consider whether some further applicationof this method could not be carried into effect by which alarger part of the burden could be placed on foreign goods anda correspondingly less burden on goods from this country.
