9 rv; q3 D0CIM2NT. 13 TH36 (31)COPY NOG A E I N E TBAGHDAD-HAIFA RAILWAY AMD PIPELIIIE.REPORT SY THE IPa,i4 OIL OOIJlITTEEo     The Iraq Oil Committee of the Cabinet have had underconsideration the situation which has  arisen  regarding  the negotiation of a new Convention between  the Iraq  Governmentand the Iraq Petroleum Company,,  A critical stage  in  thenegotiations has new been reached and  unless  the  policy proposed in the attached draft telegram  is adopted  theCommittee are of the opinion  that an agreement will not bereached and as a result a pipeline to  Haifa may not be constructed.,     They recommend therefore  the despatch of the telegramsubject to a modification of  the last  two lines;  these  it issuggested should males it clear to the  High Commissioner thatwhile His Majesty1s Government do not  wish to place  theresponsibility on him the;/ nevertheless  want  to leave to him,as the man on the spot and au fait with  the trend of negotiations, a certain amount of latitude as to  the  mannerin which he should communicate the advice to  the  Iraq Goyern-mente  A proposal in this connection will be  submitted  tothe Cabinet by the Secretary  of  Stajt-e  for the Colonies,(Itld,)   A.H.2 ,  Whit ehall Gardens , 3., &apos;,&apos;/., 1 o v     5th February, 1931.
      EEiifE TSLEGICE i?OB BStSRiiOH an HIGH OOttaaOMBBRi JRiO.     (l)  Oil negotiations.  The whole position as disclosed inyour telegrams Hos0 69 and 74 and in your previous reports hasbeen considered &quot;by Cabinet Oil Committee, and I am now in apositioE to furnish you with the views of His Majesty * s Government.     f2)  As regards the point of bifurcation, His majesty&apos;s government consider that, on the balance, the interests of Iraq.would best be served by abandoning their insistence upon Rutba andaccepting oompanyrs proposal for Haditha.  Their reasons for thisview are as follows.  Although from information communicated &quot;byEraser it seeras possible that Iraq Gorex-nment might still foroethe corapany to- agree to bifurcation at Rutba, it would seem thatthis co&quot;&quot;.ld only be done at cost of (l) incurring the definitohostility of the Prench government  and  (Z) a reductions of 100,000 in the dead rent to compensate  company for additional cost involved.  As regards (l), there is reason to believe thatthe Prench Government would oppose bifurcation at Rutba to thoutmost limit of their power.  Prench opposition might take the-form of opposing the admission of Iraq to tho Leaguo in 1932, or,possiblysan evon moro serious danger, demanding a reference of thedispute to the Permanent Court of International Justice under paragraph 5 cf the League Counoilrs decision of 27th December, 192-.-with the -possible result that the whole  orinciple of two pipelinesmight be lost and Irar find herself landed with single pipeline   \to Tripoli as being the most direct and  economical route.     (3)  Against this must be set possible danger, discussed in Nmy telegram No,33, that adoption  of Haditha bifurcation might    ^result in construction of Syrian railway?/ to Abu Pemal, existenceof which might prejudice prospect of construction of Bagdad-haifa railway.  It now appears, however, that  Cadman has telegraphedto Prasex reporting that Trench Charge &amp; Affaires at Bagdad has  \                                                  declared/
declared  that  in  order to ease position French Governmentwould he  prepared to deflect route of proposed Syrian railway from Abu  Kemai to Deir-ez-Zor, where it would constitute little or no menace to Baghdad-Haifa railway,  Iraq Government would bewell advised to attempt to secure confirmation of this extent     (4)  In any case, as explained in my  telegram No. 45, aSyrian railway, even to Abu hemal, need not necessarilyconstitute a serious threat to the Baghdad-Haifa railway, ifnot extended to connect with Iraq railway system.  Any deterrenta Syrian  railway might have would thus not be comparable tothe loss  to Iraq  of the  .100,000 in dead rent, which would be involved  by insistence upon Rutba; while that sum might other-wise be used with great advantage in connection with the bagadad-Ha if a., railway pro je ct.     (5)  It thus appears that adoption of Haditha in place ofRutba as  point of bifurcation need not materially prejudiceprospect  of construction of Baghdad-Haifa railway, whereasinsistence upon Eutba might Involve breakdt^wn of negotiationswith loss of any pipeline to Haifa, and oven If successfulwould involve  Iraq Government in loss of substantial sum whichmight be used  towards financing construction of railway, andmight damage IraqTs prospects in 19S2.     (6)  In all the circumstances therefore His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are of opinion that it would now be in the bestinterest  of Iraq to agree to a bifurcation at Haditha, but to minimise  still further any danger to Baghdad-Haifa railwayproject,  they  consider that the Iraq Government should insist upon deletion  from company1s convention cf the clause empower-ing them  to construct railways outside the area of theirconcession, and should announce their intention to refusepermission for the construction of any railway through iraq to the  Syrian  frontier without the permission of the proposedBaghdad-Haifa railway Board,
i\j y &amp;As regards the question of simultaneous corapletionof the two pipelines, H.M. G^rcrnment adhere to their view thatconstruction ff hoth lines should as far as possible proceedmodification of  this  in  order  to  facilitate  early  settlement.They suggest that  the Iraq Government  should stipulate  adefinite date for  completion cf both lines as early  as  possible,but in any case  not later than the  end of 1935-  and  not greaterinterval than 6  months between completion of Tripoli and Haifalines.     8,      As  regards  specifying  the percentage  cf oil to becarried .to Haifa,  H0K0 G* adhere to  the view  expressed in my telegram Non55y  viza  that Iraq Government should do  their utmost to induce company  to  accept a  definite ohligation  to send&quot; at least fifty per  cent&quot; of  total amount of oil.  produced to half a. As regards Gadman7s suggestion reported in your telegram no, 69 that capacity of  initial   pipeline should be  3 million tons,Hol/iVGo consider  that  Iraq. Government should  insist on figureof 4 million as  minimum,    9.      The  suggestion in  your  telegrams Ho,69 and  74that Iraq Government might revert to the earlier proposal for thegrant of a smaller area  to the Company without  any restriction as regards the pipeline  alignmentyj  in  tho hope  that  other oilinterests may be found willing to afford such sufficient financial support to ensure  construction of the  Baghdad Haifa  railway,is open to serious objection.   The result w-mld he  that iraq petroleum Company  would  send all  their oil to Tripoli,  and H. M. G.doubt whether any  of the rival oil  groups could dispose of sufficient capital to undertake  the construction  of a  separatepipeline to Haifa; and much less  to desist materially in thoconstruction of  a  railway along that route.simultaneously.They              advise  thare however prepared tothe Iraq Government  toto/agree to some
?   9(j U     10.?   To sum up therefore in the considered opinion of       the interests of Iraq could now lest be served by:-     (a)  agreeing to bifurcation at Haditha in circumstances         indicated above,,  and provided that this important         concession secures agreement satisfactory in other         respects .     (b)  deleting from the Company1s convention clause         empowering them to constiriTet railways outside         the area of their concession^     (c)  declaring their Intention to refuse permission         for construction of arty railway through Iraq to         Syrian frontier without the permission of the         proposed Baghdad-Haifa railway Board.     (d)  obtaining the following undertakings from the         C ompany:-          (l) that aJ; least 50 per cent of total oil             produced should go to Haifa;          (2) that both pipelines should be completed as             early as possible, and  in any case not later             than the end of 1935, with not more than             5 months Interval &quot;between completion of             Tripoli and Haifa lines,a (Unless you see objection, you should advise the Iraq   Government accordingly)a-a Referred to in the covering Memorandum
