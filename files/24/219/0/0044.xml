We have held  five meetings, and  have examined in thecourse of our survey explanatory documents prepared by the Seere-taries, relevant publications of the International Labour Office, andthe report of the  Working Classes  Cost-of-Living  Committee of1918.  .       II.-SHOULD  THERE  BE A NEW INQUIRY?    4.  The first question  addressed to us is &quot;whether there shouldbe  a new cost-of-living inquiry.&quot;   In  this  connection we  haveinquired  into the history  and nature of the present cost-of-living index-number.  We learn  that it originated in  the Peed  which was felt immediately after the  outbreak of the War for  some  systematicmeasurement of the rise in the cost of foodstuffs.. . To meet this need the Board of Trade began to collect at frequent intervals the current prices  at which  foodstuffs  were  being sold in working-class shops.To  combine in one &quot; foodstuffs &quot; index the increase recorded for thevarious articles it  was necessary to  give each  article a  &quot;weight&quot;appropriate to its importance.   The only comprehensive  materialavailable for  assigning these &quot;weights&quot; was  a collection  of about,000 urban  working-class family budgets made by  the Board ofTrade  in  1904.  An  average  budget derived  from these  collectedbudgets had already been  constructed and used for statistical  pur-poses; and. the relative  expenditures on the various articles of  foodas shown by this average 1904 budget with the  addition of an allow -ance for  margarine, which had  increased in importance  between1904 and 1914 were used as the &quot;weighting&quot;  basis for  the  newRetail Pood Prices Index-Number.  When, some  months later, theDepartment was required to enlarge the scope of the Index-Numberso as to cover not only food but the other principal items of working-class expenditure, a weighting basis for these other-than-food itemshad to be devised.  As regards rents, there were availablesthe resultsof an inquiry  made in 1912, For other items, such as fuel and light,clothing,  etc., estimates were made on various bases.  The five main
groups of items, viz., food, rent, clothing, fuel and light, and riiiscel-laneous. were combined in what were considered to  be appropriateratios.  This was&apos;the basis adopted for the all-items  index-number;and it is the basis still used for the cest-of-living index-number thatis calculated by the Ministry of Labour  and-published about themiddle of each month in the  &quot; Ministry  of Labour Gazette.&quot; -   ;  -   5.  The Index-Number was designed to show, and is still speci-fically issued as showing, &quot;the average increase in the cost of main-taining  unchanged the pro-war standard of living of working-classfamilies.&apos;.&apos;  For an Index-Number thus  defined the retention,  as aweighting basis, of information derived from pre-war budgets is notonly justifiable but essential.  What we have had to consider  was whether an index-number so based is  a  satisfactory  measure ofmonth-to-month changes in the cost of living at the present time, andfor the immediate future.   6.  If the Index-Number is to continue to command confidenceit is  clearly essential that its basis should  be revised from time totime.  An  index-number which measures changes in the cost of abudget determined some years ago is only a trustworthy instrumentso long  as  the  mode of living has not changed very greatly in the interval; but  there is bound to  come a time sooner or later whenmaterial changes in the proportions, qualities, or kinds of goods-bought by households are known or may be surmised to have takenplace.  The only course open is then  to drop  the  old basis  withits old proportions,  qualities and kinds, and to adopt a new  one representative of  the new mode of living.  We have had to  considerwhether that point has been reached in this country.   7.  We are now more  than  sixteen  years away  from the  baseperiod of  the. present Index-Number,  and  twenty-six  years fromthe. collection of budgets by which the selection of weights for theInd0&quot;^-^&quot;mher  was largely determined.  It is  our belief1 that themanner of  living has  changed,  as  compared\ with  the  pre-wardecade,  sufficiently   to  make  an  index-number  on  a  pre-warbudgetary  basis  an  unsatisfactory instrument  for   measuringchanges in the years ahead.   Changes  which will readily occur tothe mind are  the substitution of artificial silk garments for cotton and  woollen  garments, and the  existence  of post-war  housessensibly different in character from pre-war houses, and there have probably been changes of diet affecting  the distribution of expendi-ture  on food.   The  present  Index-Number necessarily takes  no account of these changes,  nor of new  fashions,  tastes and habitswhich have altered  the allocation  of family  expenditure.  More-over, the fact that the basis of the Index-Number  relates to  a periodso long ago as 1904-1914 serves to undermine the public confidence in its accuracy to a greater extent than is  really warranted by the changes in the  mode  of  living which have  taken  place.   Thedesirability on statistical grounds of establishing a new basis for future measurements has been  expressed  to us  by the statisticalofficers of the Ministry of Labour upon  whom responsibility for the,monthly index-figure rests.   8.  On the other hand, we have had to consider whether thepresent was a  suitable  time  for establishing,  for the official Cost^of-Living Index-Number, a budgetary basis which will have to serve.for the next ten or perhaps fifteen years. For preference we shouldchoose a  time of normal  conditions for  the  ascertainment  of  abasis,  and  the present time can hardly be  so described.   Anaverage budget of all working-class families in Great Britain to-day would show a distribution of expenditure which might be  sensiblywarped  by the diminution of income due to severe unemployment.This  factor can,  however,  be eliminated by confining  the inquiry to families in  which  the principal wage-earner is  working a normalweek.   By  observance of  this  principle we  believe that  theobjections which  would  otherwise, weigh against the  revision of thebasis under present conditions can be sufficiently met.   .9.  We have also had to consider  the possibility of the issueof a  new tlost-of-Living Index-Number. causing much  trouble tothose organisations. of employers and of  workpeople who  have, in
their wages agreements, clauses providing ior. the automatic adjustsmont of wage rates in accordance with movements in the cost ofliving;.  In this connection we think it useful to explain  that.theofficial  computations  of changes  in  the cost  of living were notoriginally  devised, with a view to, their use in wage  adjustment^,and that it: was  not untilthe end of the. third year, of  the  war thatclauses  began to be introduced into collective agreements providingfor the  systematic variation of wages in accordance with movements in the index figure.   Even  so, there was no.marked growth in thesystem  until towards the  end of 1919, when it began to  extendrapidly. By the middle of 1921 the number of employees coveredby cost of living sliding-soale agreements  actually operative had reached between 2-J-  and 3 millions,  but after some  years at that level the number declined  and at  the present date it is estimatedthat  cost  of living  sliding-scales  (including  scales  temporarilysuspended  but not  abandoned) apply to between 1J- and 2 millionemployees.    10.  We have therefore kept constantly  in mind the importanceof avoiding any such change as  might render invalid some scoresof wage agreements  affecting between 1^  and 2 million  persons.It  is true  that the parties  to  these  agreements could modify the  terms  of their sliding-seale clauses so  as  to relate them, to anew index-number  starting from  100  at  some future  date,  say in1931;  but we think that the necessity for  this should, if  possible,be avoided.  We therefore attach importance to the  maintenanceof complete continuity between the revised Index-Number and, thepresent one.  It is  easy to maintain  this  continuity, as  we showlater in our Report, by  adopting a  familiar  statistical methodknown  as  the &quot;chain method,&quot;  which is used in connection withother index-numbers when the weighting basis is modified.    11.  Having thus surveyed the question from the three stand-points  of   statistical correetitude,  of  opportuneness,  and  of  effect upon current wages  agreements;  and  having suggested means of avoiding shortcomings and  dislocations that might otherwise arise,we are  of opinion and recommend that a revised basis for  the Cost-of-Living Index-Number should be established as soon  as practicable and a new series of index-numbers be  compiled  and  issued  on thenew basis.  We hope that it will prove practicable  to collect thenecessary  information  during the year 1931, and  we  shall refer in what follows to  &quot;the 1931 basis.&quot;    12.  We desire  to make it clear at this point that the new basiswill be established solely for the purpose of measuring future changesin the cost  of living.  We have every reason to believe that  in laying the  foundation  of the  present Index-Number in 1914  the  officialstatisticians used the best information available at that time; and theIndex-Number remains unassailable as a measure of the changes inthe cost of maintaining a pre-war standard of living.  We are aware of statistical methods whereby the  budgets  of 1914 and 1931 mightbe combined by some process of averaging to remeasure  the change from 1914 to 1931; but this procedure involves too abstract a con-ception of  what it  is that  is being measured to  make it  generallyunderstandable  or  acceptable.    The current Index-Numbers will,therefore,  remain valid as the best available measure of the changesin the cost of living between 1914 and the date of the change-over;and the new basis will be applied only to the  measurement of changesin the cost of living from the date of its  issue onwards.  The methodof linking the two is dealt with in paragraph  34.       III. THE PRINCIPLES  OF  A  NEW INQUIRY.   18.  The second part of the task assigned to us is to consider theprinciples and methods by which a new cost of living inquiry shouldbe governed. ;   14.  The present Index-Number is designed to measure changesin the cost of living of urban working-ctass families; and the weightsattached to  different commodities in constructing the basic budgetwere chosen so  as to correspond to the assumed distribution ofexpenditure  by such  families.  Nov/ the distribution of expenditure
G by. the urban working-classes differs materially  from that of other classes of the community, with higher or lower incomes; and, unless the retail prices of most articles of consumption move in the same direction  in  approximately the same degree, the  official Cost-of- Living Index-Number may, therefore, give a very imperfect measure of the changes in the cost of living of these other classes.  None the: less, the remuneration of some of these classes is based on the move-. ments  of  the  official  Index-Number;  and  more  generally,  the assumption is habitually made in speech and  writing  that these movements give a  fair  indication of the alterations in the cost or living for the community as a whole.     15.  We have,  therefore,  considered at the outset whether the new Index-Number  should  be constructed on a wider basis more applicable to the general purposes to which  it is so  often  put, or alternatively  whether in  addition to an index-number  appropriate to the urban working-classes,  there should be supplementary index- numbers appropriate to such  classes as  agricultural labourers and clerical workers.  The first of these alternatives would involve the institution, of  a  general index-number of  retail prices, in which weights would be  assigned  to different commodities in accordance with the aggregate national consumption.   Such an index-number would  doubtless  represent  a  valuable  addition to  the body  of statistical information; but it would be inappropriate and unaccept- able as a substitute for,  or continuation  of, the existing Cost-of-v- Living figures. .    16.  As regards the  second alternative, we fear that the regular publication of supplementary  index-numbers  designed to measure- changes in the cost of  living of  special  classes  of  workers would weaken the authority and the status  of the main index-number  as&apos; the continuation of the  present official Cost-of-Living  figures.  We think it important to avoid the risk of any such result; and we are unable therefore to recommend the publication of any supplementary index-numbers at the present time. We recognise that such supple-. mentary index-numbers  would form a valuable  addition to the body of  statistical knowledge.   Moreover, apart from  the publication  of special index-numbers,  it would be highly  desirable  to obtain some precise knowledge, which  is at present lacking, as to the extent  to which agricultural. labourers distribute their expenditure differently from other classes of manual wage-earners.  We suggest, therefore. for the consideration of the Ministry of  Labour,  that it might be useful, simultaneously with the  budget  inquiry which we propose, to have a separate collection of budgets from agricultural labourers. This would throw light on the need for  a special index-number appropriate to agricultural labourers, and make it easier to institute&apos; one, if later on it should be thought desirable to do so.  In the mean- time, however, we take the view that only  one official  cost-of-living index-number should be published, and that it should continue t* measure, as now, the changes in the cost of living  of urban working-&quot; class families.    17.  To  measure future changes in  the  Cost of  Living of. working-class  families  one  must  ascertain  on  what  goods,  and. in&apos;  what proportions, the  average or typical  working-class  family: spends its income;  for  on  that  ascertainment  must  depend the &quot; weighting &quot; in future  calculations of the items for  which prices are  to be  periodically  obtained.   The  most  direct method  of ascertaining  this  average distribution of  expenditure is that  of asking  housewives to keep a record of their outgoings  over a week or longer period.   The method has certain defects.  One is that the households willing and  able to keep, such records tend to be the better-managed households;  another is that the keeping of detailed accounts tends in itself to  influence the distribution  of expenditure during  the  period.   The  alternative method  would be to makeinquiries  of , shopkeepers,  co-operative   society  managers,  social workers and others  on the  point, and to  arrive  by consensus  ofopinion at an average budget. . Whatever  be  the inherent defects,of the family budget method, we are convinced that this alternative method would be more open to possibilities of error,  and would neitherhave the authority nor command the acceptance, that.is,  essential. ,&quot;,
 We recommend, therefore, that the &quot; weighting&quot; basis of the new: Index-Number should be  determined by a collection of household budgets from working-class families.    18.  Having reached this conclusion, we turn to consideration of the kind and range of working-class families from whom  budget records  shall be sought.:  At this point we  desire  to make plain an  issue which  we  have had  to keep  in mind  throughout  our. deliberations.  An &quot; Inquiry into  the Cost of Living of Working- Class  Families &quot; has  values and uses other  than  those connected with future measurements of changes in the cost of living.  The data it yields will  be  for  years to come  a  part of the sub-stratum of the national edifice of social statistics;  it will  be looked to as the source of valuable material by students of affairs, social workers and Governments; and if its range and contents  were narrowed to one particular objective, great loss might ensue.   This, however, is  outside our province.   We are  charged  solely with considering the revision of  the Index-Number and it is with that aspect of  a Cost-of-Living inquiry that we deal.  We do not thereby wish our recommendations to be  taken as precluding  any extension  of the budget inquiry which may be thought desirable on other grounds.    19.  Even for  our own immediate  purpose,  we have  had to distinguish between   the  items of  information that  should he collected from working-class families and the items that should be selected therefrom  as  a proper and practicable basis for. measuring future changes in the  cost of living.  The commodities on which  a multitude of families  spend  their incomes include  a thousand and one items, many of which are insignificant  in annual total and are bought at  irregular and even long intervals.  To ask shopkeepers. to furnish month by month the prices of these oddments would be quite  impracticable.   It  is, however,  essential  to  know  how important  or unimportant the various articles are. in order  that  a knowledgeable selection of the  items to be used  for  measuring month-to-month changes may be  made.   For  kindred reasons it may be desirable to obtain budgets  from families whose composition or circumstances are such as to-make their inclusion inappropriate in  a national average in a  eost  of living. index-number.    The principle we have here followed  is  that it is necessary to make the budget inquiry  wide  rather  than  narrow  in  order  that  the determining of the basic budget for  future measurements may be wisely carried out.    20.  Following this principle, we recommend  that the collection of budgets should be from urban manual workers,  including shop assistants and clerks whose status  and wages approximate to those of  industrial wage-earners,  and should  be representative  of  the different areas and industries of the country.  In  order that  the prevalent  unemployment   may  not invalidate  the   basis,  we recommend that the budgets be  obtained preferably from families in  which the principal  wage-earner is   working a  normal  week (neither  unemployed,  nor under-employed, nor  on overtime) and should include families of all kinds,  irrespective of  the  number of children living at home or of the number of wage-earners.   An attempt might usefully be made to  obtain the  budgets of  single persons, but those should be  regarded   as  apart from  the  main inquiry.  Families containing paying lodgers should not,  we  think, be included in the inquiry.    21.  We contemplate that the housewives who are good enough to offer to assist tho Ministry of Labour by  keeping  budget records will be provided with a schedule on which  to enter their expendi- ture the weights  or  measures  of  things  bought and  the  sums paid for  them, appropriate spaces being provided for the entry of the  various items;   We do  not anticipate  any  difficulty on this score in the case  of  those items  which  are within, the personal jurisdiction of the housewives who have  had the good-will to offer their help.  It would,  however,  be of great additional value  if the total  family income   could  be  ascertained, in  order  that the expenditure on the various items could be  expressed as a proportionof the total family income.  We realise  that there may in  many&apos;cases be difficulty in getting this information, but we suggest that
 the Ministry of Labour  should  consider whether provision  might not usefully  be made on  the  schedule for  a statement  of total income where it can be given without doubt or embarrassment.    .22.  We have considered whether it would be advisable to ask for a statement of the amount spent on beer or spirits.  Our view is that  such a question would  be  offensive  to  many families;  and experience in this and other  countries has  shown that information obtained  on the point  through  the medium of budget inquiries is seldom trustworthy.  On wider  grounds we are of opinion that the consumption  of  alcoholic drink  varies  so  greatly among  families- and is so generally  regarded  as supplementary to basic needs that- its inclusion as an item in an index-number of changes in the cost of  living  is not  called for.    We  accordingly recommend  that no question as to consumption of alcoholic drink be asked on the budget - schedule  and  that  alcoholic  drink be  not included  in  the  basic index-number budget.    23.  We have felt  more hesitation in regard  to such items as education,  amusements,  holidays,  insurances and  subscriptions. These are important and  unquestioned elements in the expenditure of large numbers of working-class families.  There would be some little  difficulty in ascertaining the  expenditure  on such items; but the main difficulty would lie  in introducing them into calculati ms of changes in the cost of living.  For the measurement of changes &apos; in  price,  the article itself must be measurable and must remain reasonably  constant in  nature  and  quality.    With education, amusements,   holidays,  insurances,   subscriptions,   &amp;c,   these conditions do not obtain.  We recommend, therefore, that informa- tion in regard  to such expenditures shall be sought and  tabulated, in order that an indication mav be available as to their im portance- in  family expenditures, although we are  aware  that  it may not be  possible  to  embody these  items  in the structure  of a monthly index-number.    24. The  length of  the  period  over  which  housewives are invited to keep their budget  records is  of importance.   The ideal- period woulr  be a  whole  year;  but  we regard  that  as  quite&quot; impracticable by reason of the labour it would throw both on the housewife and on the compilers of the  records.  One  week is the- minimum; and  one  week would serve for households in which the-- income was regular and the distribution of  expenditure fairly constant,  provided care were taken  in regard to food stuffs on hand at the beginning and at the end of the week, and provided a week could  be chosen reasonably typical of the  average expenditure of the year.  A more elaborate plan, which would  have the advantage of reflecting seasonal  changes in the distribution of  expenditure, would be  to  obtain budgets for  four weeks  separated  by  quarterly intervals.   To  this  there  are.  two drawbacks; one that in practice a large proportion of those who  kept the records for the first week would fail,  for  divers  reasons,  to complete  the  full  series; and the other  that the whole operation would occupy over nine months.&apos; We incline to the view that the most advantageous plan  would be to aim at getting continuous  budget records over four consecutive weeks round about the months  of  April or October,  to  use  theserecords as the main  data for establishing the basic average budget, and to solicit from  a  certain number of families further  weekly budgets at three quarterly intervals, which budgets will serve as a valuable  clue  to seasonal modifications  of expenditure.   We are aware  of  the   difficulties  that  have  been  almost  invariably experienced  in obtaining some thousands of family budgets for as long a period as one month.  But,  against this, it must be borne in mind that public  interest in index-numbers of the cost of living and understanding  of  their  significance have grown immenselyduring the past ten  or twenty years.  We  are  hopeful, therefore,. that with  the organisation we have in mind,  and with public co-operation  and good-will, the undertaking will  prove successful.  Ifit should turn out that we have been unduly optimistic in regard.to the maintaining of records over four weeks, the records of the -first week will have to be mainly relied upon, checked in  the  light of such four-weekly  records as have been  obtained.  We have no,
doubt that many families will be found who will not only maintain&apos;the four-weekly record  but will offer to supply weekly  records at&apos;three successive quarterly intervals.              &apos;         &apos;    *&quot;  &apos; 25.  No collection of weekly or monthly records&apos;can1  adequately,reflect the annual average of such Occasional expenditure as  thatupon the  more durable  articles  of clothing and  furniture, or uponannual holidays, or upon  fuel and light  where coal is  bought by&apos;the load or gas bills are  paid  quarterly.  For all such irregularor periodic expenditures there  should be sought  annual or otherestimates  from which the  average weekly or  monthly expenditurecan  be  computed.   Not all these items  will lend themselves to inclusion in the basic budget to be  used for the calculation of  futurechanges, but it  is desirable that their importance  in the working-class budget should  be  known.   26.  In the 1904  Budget inquiry some  2,000 budgets were obtained for a period of one week.  We are of opinion that on this occasion  a larger  number  should  be aimed at.  We  hope  it willbe possible to secure  10,000 completed and usable four-weeklybudgets.   To  ensure this number, it may be desirable  to &quot; placeOut &quot; some 20,000 schedules.  If  the proportion of usable budgetsis higher  than we anticipate,  so much the better.   27.  We turn  novv to the  method of placing out and collectingthe budget schedules.  This would most appropriately be organised,we consider, through the  medium of the chief officers, men andwomen, of Employment Exchanges.   These officers of the Ministryof Labour  are  brought in the course of  their  work  into closepersonal contact with representatives of workers&apos;  organisations - ofall kinds  in their several  areas,  and  could,  we  believe,  readilyassemble small ad hoc groups of persons who would undertake the finding of  families willing  to  keep budget records, the supervision of the  recording,  and the  collection and  transmission  of the completed  schedules.  We  have in mind trade-union secretaries,leaders  of the co-operative movement,  educationists,  and  otherswhose interests  bring them into close relations with working-classfamilies.  In order that the assembled budgets may be representa-tive of conditions throughout the country,  we suggest that the chiefEmployment Exchange officer at  each centre should be asked toorganise the collection  of a specified number of  budgets propor-tionate to  the size of the industrial  population in his or her area,and  to aim at securing and  distributing them so as to secure a rough representation of families deriving  their livelihood from theoccupations mainly followed in  the area.   28.  The keeping of a detailed record  of family expenditure fortour  successive  weeks is no light task for persons unaccustomedto such book-keeping;  and we think it would  not be inappropriate,and  would  certainly be advantageous, to make it known  that agratuity  (we suggest the sum of  five shillings) will be  offered tohousewives who complete the  four-weekly record.   The placing outof schedules,  the  rendering of  assistance in filling them up, andtheir collection and  transmission will also prove  an exacting  taskto those who  undertake it; but we  think it possible that an offer of payment for this work  would be resented  by many  and  wouldresult in more loss of valuable help than gain.  We therefore make no recommendation  under this  head;  the matter is one best  left,we think, to the discretion of the  Ministry of Labour.             IY. THE  NEW  BASIC  BUDGET.   29.  When  the budget schedules have been collected it will benecessary to construct from  them an average or  typical budgetdesigned to  serve  as the &apos;&apos; weighting &apos;&apos; basis of those items whoseprice  changes  from  month  to  month  are  to  be subsequentlyascertained  for the  purpose  of  calculating   the  Cost-of-living index-Number.   For  this  purpose only the  budgets of  urbanworkmg-class families should be used;  and a useful  criterion of&quot;working-class family&quot; might be, we think,  the employment of
 the head of the  family in an  &quot;insured occupation&quot; (i.e., insured under  the  Health  Insurance  Acts).   Having  assembled   these particular budgets, they should be combined so as to yield a budget representative of the average expenditure of all the  familie.3.  This average budget,  as already  stated,  will include innumerable  items of  relatively  trifling importance;  and the next  operation will be to. select,  from the whole range of items, those  to  be included in the basic budget to be used for subsequent measurement of changes in  the cost of living.    30.   Obviously we cannot at this stage specify what items shall or  shall not  be  adopted for inclusion in the basic  budget.   That can only  be  done  when  the  facts have  been  ascertained and tabulated.  We can, however, suggest the principles on which the selection should  be made.  We suggest that the condition requisite for the  inclusion of any item in the basic budget should be (a) that its  price should be continuously measurable;  (b) that its purchase should  be at reasonably frequent intervals;  (c) that expenditure upon it  should be  reliably ascertainable; and (d) that expenditure upon it  should  be  sufficient  to influence the  measure  of  total budgetary price-changes.   These conditions  must  rule out  such items  as  soft  fruits  which  appear on the  popular  market at particular seasons only, and must make the inclusion of other more constantly obtainable fruits and vegetables  difficult by reason of the changes in quality which take place  through the seasons; but we  should like the  Ministry of Labour to consider the practicability - of  including some vegetables other than  potatoes, and some fruits, such as apples, oranges and bananas, in the index-number basis. We further  suggest that the Ministry should  consider the special difficulties of measuring changes in  the price of clothing  due to changes in fashion and quality.    81.   The new basis will,  as before, cover only a part, though we hope a  substantial part of  the whole expenditure  of an  average working-class family.  We ought perhaps  to emphasise the fact that the exclusion from the calculations of a multitude of small items does not necessarily bias the Index-Number.   If the price  movements of the articles excluded are approximately  the same as those of the articles  included, the effect  of the  exclusion  of the  miscellaneous articles  is nil.  Even if the price movements of the excluded articles are sensibly  different from those of  the included articles, the effect of  exclusion upon  the Index-Number, provided the  proportion of excluded articles  is not great, will be immaterial.  We lay stress on this point  in order  to counter an idea often erroneously held that a budgetary basis which does  not cover all articles must necessarily result in an index-number that is too low.   So far as it has any effect at all, it might just  as well cause the Index-Number to be too high.    32.   Further, we think it may be well to forestall one  possible misuse  of  the results of the  budget inquiry which we here recom-. mend.  No particular significance will attach to  the average  total weekly  expenditure of the  families  from whom  the budgets are collected, and it  would be  quite illegitimate to compare the weekly expenditure of the 1931 budgets with that of the pre-war  budgets for  the  purpose of drawing any conclusion as to the  change in the cost of  living.   The  comparison of  average  budgets at different periods  includes  two  elements, the  change in  the cost of  a  given standard of living,  and the change in the standard of living itself, and obviously an altered standard of living cannot be adduced as proof that it costs more or less to live.   Moreover,  the average of any number of budgets that can be collected in practice cannot be relied on to represent the true average  of the expenditure of all working-class families.   The precise amount of the average of the budgets  used will  depend upon the incomes  of the  families whoconsent  to assist the inquiry;  the chance inclusion of a larger numberof  low-income or high-income  families will  depress or  raise the average accordingly.    The  precise  monetary  total of the average budget will have  little significance.  What is alone of  importance isthe average distribution of the  expenditure, and that will be  littleinfluenced by a  difference of  a few shillings  up or  down in the monetary average of the budgets collected.
    33.  We proceed now to elaborate our suggestion that,  in order to-avoid disturbance to wages agreements with eost-of-liviug sliding- scales, the new Index-Number should be linked on to  the old one. When a series  of index-numbers is being constructed  to show the i change in prices as from a  given  date,  the  obvious  and natural course, where there are no reasons to the contrary, is to  call the price-level at that date 100 and to state subsequent levels as 103 (a 8 per cent, increase) or 95 (a 5 per cent, decrease) and so on.  There is,  however,  no  absolute reason why the price-level at the basic date should be called 100; it can be called 1 or 1,000 or 150 or can be given any other numerical value.  We propose,  therefore, that the.price- level at the basic date for the new Index-Number shall  be given the value    whatever figure the  present Index-Number may represent at. the date of the change-over from the old to the new.  If the pre-.- sent index-figure (with the basal  100 added) should be, let us say,, 147 at the date of the change-over,  then 147 shall be taken as the basis in comparison with which all subsequent price-levels shall be recorded.    84.   Let  us make  this plain by imagining  what  the  position might be at  the date of the change-over.  Let us suppose that the change is made  in  the month  of October 1932, and  that in  the previous month  of September, the Index-Number had stood at  147. The cost of all the articles in the basic budget had worked out,, in September,  at. let  us  say, 62s. l\d.   That 62s. l\d. is taken as having the value of  147.   Now suppose that in October the cost of the articles in the basic budget works out  at 62s. 5fo\   That is  an increase of A\d. on 62s.      which is an increase of 0-57 per cent. The Index-Number for  October, on the new  basis, will  therefore be 147 plus 0&apos;57 per cent, of 147, an increase of 0-84 points, bringing the Index-Number to 147-84, which would be announced  as an Index- figure of 148. We think it desirable that the Index-Number should be stated with the basal 100 added, and  not, as hitherto, in the form of a percentage increase,    35.   Doubts have been expressed as to the desirability of  thus superimposing the new Index-Number upon  the old, on the ground that it would give official countenance to the view that  two or more series of price index-numbers can legitimately be linked so as to form a continuous series.   This  practice of linking series together, how- ever,  is, as we have  indicated earlier, habitually used in connection with other well-known index-numbers, including the Board of Trade Index-Number of wholesale prices, and the  legitimacy of the method is supported by  the  most authoritative statistical opinion.  We  are satisfied that  the new Index-Number linked  together with  the  old in.the manner we propose  will give not  a  less but a more accurate picture of the changes in the cost of living in  future years compared with 1914 than  a continuance of the present  index-number would give,  while it will certainly  give a more accurate picture of  the changes  from month to month and from  year to year in future. Finally, the desirability of avoiding a wanton  disturbance of existing wage  agreements is  in our judgment a  consideration of paramount importance in favour of the course we propose.   36.  It may be desirable  that the Ministry of Labour Gazette in its monthly publication of the  Index-Number should  show some- where the  percentage change in the cost of living as  compared with the new basic price-date, but we are clear that the  figure givenprominently as the official Index-Number should be continuous with the existing series.   The change  will clearly  call for a modificationof the wording of the  formal statement in the Ministry of  Labour Gazette, for obviously the phrase &quot; designed to measure  the increasein the cost of maintaining the pre-war standard of living of working-class families&quot;  can no longer be used.   We  suggest that on thefirst appearance of  the new  Index-Number  a detailed statement should be given  of the  procedure  that has been followed, and that thereafter a form of words be used  which will describe in general

Finally, the desirability of avoiding a  wanton disturbance of existing wage agreements is  in our judgment a consideration of paramount importance in favour of the course we propose.   36. It may be  desirable  that  the Ministry&apos; of  Labour  Gazette in its monthly  publication of the Index-Number should show some-; where  the percentage  change in the cost of living as  compared with the new basic price-date, but we are clear that the  figure given prominently as the official Index-Number should be continuous with the existing series.   The change will clearly call for a modification of the  wording of the formal statement in the  Ministry of Labour Gazette, for obviously the phrase &quot; designed to measure  the increase in the  cost of maintaining the pre-war standard of living of working- class families&quot;  can no longer be  used.  We suggest that on thefirst  appearance of  the  new  Index-Number  a  detailed statement should be given of  the procedure that has been followed, and that thereafter a form of words he used which will  describe in general
terms what it is that the Index-Number represents, with an implicitreference back to the original detailed statement.   87.  In the illustrations given above we have assumed that the basic  price-date  would  be  the  prices current on a  particular  dayof a particular month.  There are, we realise, objections to the useof a single date as the price-basis of an index-number; indeed, therehave  been  criticisms of the present  index-number on  the groundthat  it makes  comparison with prices in July, 1914. July  being  amonth in the season of low prices.  Probably no single  date can befound at which the prices of such seasonally-fluctuating goods as eggs,milk, potatoes and coal are at the average  of their yearly cycle.It would be preferable to adopt as the basic price-level  the averageof prices over a period of twelve months; but the practical difficultiesappear  to  be  too  great.    Further,  to  adopt this  course woulddelay for some time the institution of the  new Index-Number  andwould introduce the possibility of a  jump in the Index-Number atthe time of the change-over attributable  solely to the change-over.Moreover, there is  not  the same  force in the  objection  to selectinga single month for a mere revision of the basis of an index-number which will  maintain its character as a continuous series as therewas to the selection of a single month as  the original  base of thewhole series.   It is  important to realise  that the  quantities onwhich the new index-number will be based  do not relate to a singlemonth, but will be chosen so as  to represent as far as  possible anaverage for the year.  For these reasons we are forced  to the con-elusion that the prices current at one selected date must be made the basic prices for the  new computations, and we  suggest that an effort should be made to select a date at which the prices of such articlesas eggs, milk, potatoes and coal  are  not very far from the annual average.   88.  There remains a  minor point  of  detail.   At  present theIndex-Number ordinarily  relates  to the first day of  each calendarmonth.  This is  inconvenient in various ways and is apt to provemisleading.  It would be preferable, we think, that a  day in themiddle of  the month should be  selected.   This day  we suggestshould not be the same date in each month (i.e.,  the  15th or the16th), but  the middle Friday or Saturday,  these being the days onwhich the greater part  of working-class purchases are made.         YI. SUMMARY OF  CONCLUSIONS  AND                    RECOMMENDATIONS.   We summarise our principal conclusions and recommendations asfollows:    39.  If  the  Cost-of-Living Index-Number is  to  continue  to command confidence, it is  clearly essential that its basis should be revised from time to time.  We are now more than sixteen years away from  the base period of the present Index-Number and twenty-six years from the collection of budgets by which the selection of weightsfor the Index-Number was largely determined.  We believe that themanner of living has changed as compared with the pre-war decadesufficiently  to make  an index-number on a pre-war budgetary basisan unsatisfactory instrument  for measuring changes in the years ahead.  We recommend,  therefore, that a revised basis  for  theCost-of-Living Index-Number  should  be established  as soon aspracticable,  and  that a new  series of index-numbers should  becompiled and issued on the new basis.   The current Index-Numberwill  remain valid  as the  best available  measure  of  the  changesin the cost of  living between 1S14 and  the  date of  the  change-over ; and the new basis will be applied only to the measurement of changes from the date of its issue onwards.  We attach importanceto the  maintenance  of complete  continuity  between  the  revisedIndex-Number and the present one.  (Paragraphs 6-12.)
    40.  We  recommend  that the  Cost-of-Living  Index-Number should continue to measure, as now, the changes in the cost of living of urban working-class families.  (Paragraphs 14-16.)    51.  We recommend  that the &quot;weighting&quot;  basis of  the new Index-Number should be  determined by  a collection of household budgets. The collection should be made from urban manual workers, including  shop  assistants  and  clerks,  whose  status  and  wages approximate to those of industrial  wage-earners, and should be repre- sentative of the  different areas and industries of the country.  The budgets should be obtained preferably from families in  which the principal wage-earner is working a normal week, and should include families of  all kinds irrespective of the number of children living at home or of the number of wage-earners.  (Paragraphs 17-20.)    42.  We contemplate that the housewives who are good enough to assist the  Ministry of Labour by keeping budget records will be provided with a  schedule on which to enter their expenditure.  We suggest that the Ministry of Labour should consider whether provision might not usefully be made on the schedule for a statement of total income  where it may be  given without doubt or embarrassment, though we  realise that  there may in  many cases  be difficulty in getting this information.  We recommend that no question as to the consumption of alcoholic drink be  asked on the budget schedule and that  alcoholic drink be not  included  in the basic index-number budget. In regard to expenditure on such items as education, amuse- ments, holidays,  insurance and subscriptions, we recommend that information should be sought and tabulated, though we  recognise that it may not be possible to embody these items in the structure of a monthly index-number.  (Paragraphs 21-23.)    43.   As  regards the period over which  budget records should be collected, we  incline to the view that the most advantageous  plan would be to  aim  at getting  continuous  budget records for  four consecutive weeks round about the months of April or October, to use these records  as the main data to establish the basic average budget and to solicit from a certain number of  families  further weekly budgets at three quarterly intervals so as to obtain a clue to seasonal modifications  of  expenditure.   We hope that it will be  possible  to secure 10,000  completed and usable four-weekly budgets.   To ensure this number  it  may  be  desirable to  &quot;place  out&quot;  some  20,000 schedules.  (Paragraphs 24-26.)    44.  We   consider  that  the  budget   inquiry   would  most appropriately  be  organised through the medium of the Employment Exchanges.   The Employment Exchange officers could, we believe, readily  assemble small ad hoc groups of persons who would undertake the finding of  families willing to keep budget records, the supervision of the recording and the collection and transmission of the completed schedules.   We  think it would not bs inappropriate and would certainly be advantageous  to  make it known that a  gratuity  (we suggest the sum of five shillings) would be offered to housewives who complete the four-weekly record.  (Paragraphs 27-28.)   45.  When the  budget  schedules  have been  collected  and averaged, the  next operation will be to select from the whole range of items those to be included in  the basic  budget  to be  used for subsequent measurement of changes in the cost of living.  Conditions requisite for the inclusion of any item in the basic budget are     (a)  that its price should be  continuously measurable;    (b)  that its purchase should be at reasonably frequent intervals;    (o) that expenditure upon it should be reliably ascertainable;          and    (d)  that expenditure upon it should be sufficient to influence         the   measure   of   total  budgetary   price   changes,          (Paragraphs 27-30.)   46.  We recommend that the new Index-Number should be linkedon to the present Index-Number, so as to form a continuous series^ by
giving to the price level at the basic date for the new Index-Numberwhatever figure the present Index-Number may represent at the dateof theNchange-over from the bid to the new.  (Paragraphs 33-37.)   47.  We recommend that the new  Index-Number should relateto a day  in  the middle of the month  rather than the first of themonth, as at present.
