THIS DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY  OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Printed for the Cabinet.  January 1931.SECRET.                                                     Copy No.    5CP.  5 (31).                                 CABINET.THE SITUATION IN MALTA.PROPOSAL FOR  APPOINTMENT  OF A ROYAL  COMMISSION.            Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.    IT is  now necessary to  consider  what  steps  should  be taken  to  secure  apermanent  settlement of  the Maltese problem.   After examining the matter,  inconsultation with the Foreign Office and  the Governor, I have reached the conclusionthat the wisest course would be to appoint a Royal Commission of Enquiry; and I.should like to have the sanction of the Cabinet to take action accordingly.    The position, it will be recollected, is as follows :  In  June last  the cabinet approved  the  suspension of  the Malta  Constitution, a  step that had  been recommended in OP. 206  (30).   The object of this  step was to  meet the difficult situation arising  from the incursion  of  the Roman  Catholic  Bishops  into thetemporal affairs of the Island.   In anticipation of the local General Election, the bishops had issued a Pastoral Letter,  the effect of  which was to declare that  allpersons who voted for the Constitutionalist Party would be refused the sacraments.Certain persons were so refused.    This high-handed action produced a position which made it impossible for HisMajesty&apos;s Government  to allow  the election to proceed.   The  Constitution was accordingly suspended,  and  the  administration of the Island  on  behalf of theImperial Government was taken over  by the Governor, in  whom  full  executive authority was vested.  The existing Ministry, with Lord Strickland at its head, was,however, retained in office in a purely advisory capacity.    This step  was never intended to be  more than a temporary expedient.  Theintention was to provide a solution of immediate  legal difficulties;  to allay  the acutesituation provoked by the action of the Bishops, which had greatly inflamed feeling among the Islanders, and to afford a period of calm for further reflection.  Thisobject wa,s achieved.    It was further hoped that, in the interim, some gesture might be made by the vatican which would  render  possible a  free  election and the resumption  of constitutional  Government.  Six months have  now, however, elapsed, and there appears to  be  little prospect  of this  hope being  realised.   The Governor nowrepresents  to me that, in the absence of a move on  the  part  of  the Vatican, it  is imperative that steps should be taken to arrive at   permanent  settlement.  It  is evident that the present temporary regime cannot continue indefinitely.  General DuCane  accordingly recommends that a Royal Commission should be sent out to the island as soon as possible, to examine  tihe situation and to advise what  measures should be adopted.  I strongly recommend the Cabinet to sanction this course.  after a  full examination of the possible  alternatives, I  am  satisfied  that  from everystandpoint it is the wisest one to take.    General Du Cane further recommends that the dismissal of the present ministry should  be  coupled with  the announcement of  the decision  to  appoint  a RoyalCommission.  I agree with him that this step is essential. The Ministry&apos;s mandateexpired some months ago. Their position was  derived  from a Parliament whichhad ceased to exist with the suspension of Constitutional Government.  It is difficult,in these circumstances, to justify  their remaining longer in office and drawing their       [223301
        salaries.   Their  retention was decided on so as to avoid the appearance of their        being dismissed  at the bidding  of the Vatican.   The  appointment  of  a Royal        Commission will  now supply  a&quot; thoroughly sound  reason  for  getting rid of ttiem        without His Majesty&apos;s Government being exposed  to this charge.  Their retention        has already exposed the Governor  to considerable attack in the  local Press, which        it would be unwise to ignore.  Moreover, Lord Strickland, who is temperamentally        a very difficult person, has, on his recent return to the Island, adopted an attitude        towards   the  Governor which makes  the  removal  of his  Ministry  additionally        desirable.  Lastly, the local ecclesiastical authorities have already evinced hostility        to the idea of a Royal Commission, and their attitude, according to Sir John Du Cane,        is influenced by the Ministers&apos; continuance in office.             The Governor has asked  to be consulted with  regard to the terms of reference        of the Commission and its personnel, and I propose to discuss these points with him        &apos; further before coming to a decision with regard to them.  My view is, however, that        the Commission should be a small one, of, say, three members.  A retired member        of the Diplomatic Service, a Colonial Governor or other distinguished official on the        retired list, and  a person of standing in legal circles  in  this country,  would, I        consider, be a suitable composition.  It would be desirable that at least one member        should be a Roman Catholic.             In order to avoid apprehensions on the part of the local religious authorities, I        consider it would be  desirable to emphasize in the terms of reference the constitu-        tional rather than the ecclesiastical aspect of the problem.  It may be sufficient simply        to instruct the Commission to report on &apos;&apos; what steps should be taken to re-establish        Constitutional Government in Malta.&quot;             I should  be glad to receive the authority of my colleagues to take action on the        above lines.   I have carefully considered whether  any lesser form of enquiry than        - that  by  a Royal  Commission would meet the case,  and have reached  the definite        conclusion that it would  not.  The problem involves important issues of &quot; Church        and State &apos;&apos; and of our relations with  the Vatican.  In view of the  position of the        Island as our naval base  in the Mediterranean, its future form of Government is  a        matter of great interest from  the Imperial  standpoint.   An alteration of the k       Constitution  can only  be effected by  an Act  of  the British Parliament.  It is,        therefore, clearly desirable that the enquiry should be conducted by a body which        will command prestige.                                                                                   P.Colonial Office, January 8, 1981.
