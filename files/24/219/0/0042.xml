9- j&amp;SSS^^                                                COPY No.. ...-  &apos;-                       CABINET             jmmSEUt OF PALESTINE AND EAST AFRICA                     LOANS ACT ,1926 c           MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES.                 It is necessary for me, in conjunction with the        Financial Secretary to the treasury to bring before        my Colleagues as a matter of great urgency in view of        the Easter recess, a small difficulty arising out of        the Palestine and East Africa Loans Actc1926p which        although of no political importance makes  it desirable        to  amend the Act as soon as possible.                The Act gave power to  the  Treasury  to guarantee        loans aggregating 10 million pounds in all,  i-raised by        the dependencies  in East Africa, but it laid down  as a        condition of such guarantee tnat the dependeueiee  in        question should provide  by law, inter alia, that the        charges on a loan should have priority over any charges       not existing at the  date of the Act.               With so many dependencies concerned in the       apportionment of 10 million pounds,  it was hardly likely       that either the Treasury  or the Colonial Office should       foresee the possibility of a dependency raising %m &apos;       loans under the terms of the Act.   But, owing to other                                                 arrangements
IVJIAL OFFICE 83rd March ,,1931.arrangements which nave been made, It is now contemplated that only Tanganyika and wyasaland snail take advantage ofthe East African portion of the Act. and Tanganyika is, infact o on the point of raising its second Guaranteed Loan.         The issue of the l&amp;mt is of considerable urgencyas it is important to repay to the Crown Agents for theColoniesat the earliest possible date, the money whichhas been advanced for works to be constructed under theloan.  Tanganyika hass in fact, already enacted anOrdinance which follows the terms of the Act in providing that the second 3,oan shall have priority over any Ciiargesnot existing at the date of the Act.  As this provision was of course made also in the case of the first loan,the result would be that the new Ordinance would overridethe provisions of the former one and make the first loanrank as a second charge after the second loan, an arrange-ment which w0o4d.be a breach of the conditions applying tothe first !.oan0        The same difficulty renders It Impossible to makethe second loan rank equally with the first. It istherefore necessary to effect a  simple  amendment of theAct.        This amendment would consist of inserting a fewwords to provide that a loan raised under the Act shouldriave priority over all charges,  other^than. thj?se^ for^l^anjjprevlouslyr  issued under^the;.Act^not existing at the&quot;date of the Act,                                      P.
