INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT IN DEPRESSED AREAS.            Note by the President of the Board of Trade,        (In continuation of Note circulated with U.?.(30)42.   1.  Certain developments have taken place in Lancashire sincethe circulation of my note on industrial development In depressed areas, (U.P. (30)42.)   2.  On the 2nd January the Lord Mayor of Liverpool organiseda luncheon which was attended by Lord Derby, the Lord Mayor of manchester and by the Mayors of all industrial towns of importancein Lancashire, together with leading personalities in Lancashireindustry.   As a result of speeches made at the luncheon and of discussions which took place afterwards the view was expressed that an organisation on an industrial basis ought to be createdto encourage new industrial development in South-East Lancashire.The Manchester Chamber of Commerce have now taken the initiativeby inviting Chambers of Commerce in Lancashire to send representatives to a conference to be held In Manchester onJanuary 20th.

I should mention that we are also in touch with theTyneside Development Association, and it may be possibleto use this organisation and an allied organisation for theTees-side as the basis for action in the K.E. area similar tothat proposed in Lancashire.
