&apos;&apos;ffiIS SOCUMMT 13 THE PROPERTY 0? HIS BRIMNIC HAJE3TYr3 GOVERNMENT)SECRET.I.F.4 (31)Oopy Hqa   5^         0 A B I 11 g T.    RURAL AMENITIES BILL.Memorandum by Minister of Health.     1.   The Bill is the Second Order for Friday, the 23rd instant,It is the same as the Bill introduced last Session and given a Second Reading, but later dropped because there was no chance of its becoming law.          The Government supported the Second Reading of theBill of last Session (I circulated a Cabinet Memorandum,CP.54 (30) on the 17th February last) despite its many defects,in view of the general purposes which it was intended tosecure.  In the course of the debate, however, I stated thatI had in contemplation a measure for extending planning powersmore far-reaching than the proposed Bill.     2.   The object of the Bill is to make further provisions for the preservation of rural amenities.  This it proposes todo by -Empowering town planning schemes to be made for rural areas.     Schemes have now in the main to be limited to &quot;land in the     course of development or likely to be used for building&quot;,     although, in fact, a good deal of rural land is     incidentally included in some schemes:Empowering County Councils compulsorily to acquire land up-to     220 yards on each side of a new road and providing for the     inclusion of that land in  a town  planning  soheme:
Eaquiring Oounty Gouncila or JoAzrt ICovm p;Uuoriijag XJommitH^s -to   make full survoya of their areas.Prohibiting the &quot;export of ancient buildings&quot; without   consent (provision for this purpose is included in the   new Ancient Monuments Bill):Further control of advertisements and the registration of   troea to bo preserved and prohibition of their destruction   without consent;prohibition of refuse dumps, without the consent of the local   Authority of the district, in areas outside that of the   Local Authority disposing of it.          There are several other provisions including a highly controversial clause in regard to compensation (Clause 4).    3.    The Bill will no doubt again obtain a largo measureof support.   But the position now is different from what it was last year.   The intention to introduco a Bill for extendingplanning powers, to already developed and to  rural areas, was announced in tho King1 s Speech.   I iiopo to submit a draft ofthe new 3ill to the Rome Affairs Committee at an early date.It will  cover much of the ground dealt with in the present RuralAmenities Bill, and private amendments could be moved, if desired,on some matters not covered.   The Rural Amenities Bill wouldrequire very drastio amendment to convert it into a workablemeasure.         - Some statement on the Bill will presumably have to bemade in the House by a Minister and-I take it that, under cabinet minutes 71(30)14 and 72(30)12, what should be said is (1) that thoprovisions of this Bill are largely covered by the Town and country Planning Bill which the Government hope to introduce and(2) that it will be difficult, if not indeed imposaiblo, tofind Parliamentary time for this Bill.
