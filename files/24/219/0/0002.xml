(THIS  DOCUMENT  IS  THE PROPERTY  OF  HIS  BRI TAHITI G MAJE,:.:TY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT)RET.CP. 2.  (31)COPY HO. 3C A B I N E        THE SOHNEIDEP  TROPHY  CONTEST, 1931.     Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.   1.   In his paper of  the 50th December 1930  (CP.422  (30)),the Secretary of State for Air  submits for . decision by theCabinet the question whether  a  Royal Air Force  team shouldbe entered for the above  contest, at a cost of  at least- 80,000 to public funds.   Lord Amulree.presents thearguments for and against the proposal, but makes no positiverecommendation, though I  gather that he is in favour of  iton the whole.   I hcuve no hesitation in asking,  that theproposal be rejected, on  the  following grounds   2.   In the present critical state of the national finances, it is essential that no new expenditure should be incurred unless it can be shown to be absolutely necessarj&apos;-in the national interest.  The Secretary of State has alreadylaid before me proposals for a very, substantial Increase ofAir Estimates for 1931 above the 1930 figure.   Those.proposals are now under examination;  but I have already indicated that I cannot possibly acquiesce in them.  that another  80,000 odd should/how be added to. his figures is,on financial grounds alone, quite out of the question.   3. . . I do not believe&apos; that it is really necessary for our national prestige to defend the Trophy this year.   Iunderstand that in very similar circumstances the U.S.A.Government decided, after their victory in 1925, that they
would not  compete  again  officially,  and that they haveadhered  to  their decision,  although  it has meant that inthe  last two  races no tuScA,  team has been able to compete.As to our  export trade,  the manufacturers themselves donot  seem to  attach great  importance  to participation, since i understand  that  they are  not prepared to contribute towardsthe  cost.   4.    The Secretary of  State admits  (paragraph 10(d) of his memorandum) that the termination of  the contest would now be generally  acceptable in  all countries;  but he thinks that thebest way to achieve this  end  is for  us to make an effort towin  the  Trophy  outright  first.  On the contrary, I think thatthe  best time to move in  the  matter  is now, when we, as thewinners  for  the last two  years, can  take the initiative in thematter without  loss of honour.  If.we  enter in 1931 and win, weshall probably  be  pressed,  as an act of good sportsmanship, topresent  a  fresh Trophy for  competition;  if we lose, as theSecretary  of  State himself  points  out, the contest may go onindefinitely.   5.  I therefore propose  that we should adhere to our previous decision that a Royal Air Force team should not enter for theTrophy contest  this year, and that His MajestyTs Government shouldtake immediate  action to  put  an end  to this pernicious form ofinternational rivalry by approaching the other Governmentsconcerned  with  a  suggestion that,  after the 1931 race  (in whichwe have  already announced our intention not to compete with aGovernment team) ,  all. the Governments  concerned should agree thatthe  race for the  Trophy  in  its present form should come to an end;and  that thereafter no  Government  should give  any form of. finan- cial assistance,  either  direct or  indirect, to  any kind of international air  contest.  Such  contests would- thus be left to private  organisation,  in the  same  way  as  international motor-carraces,  and  in accordance  with  the  Intentions of  the -original founder
   6.  The present is the natural and appropriate moment for such action, following immediately on the official announcement that Prance and Italy both intend to compete.                            (Inltd.)  P. SoTreasury Chambers, S.W.I.    Januaxy 3rd, 1931.
