JQCIMSNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVEEKIENT.31).                                               COPY -NO;   5_                                 CABINET.                              STATE OF TRADE.            Memorandum &quot;by  the President  af  the Board of Trade.         Complete  figures  for 1930 are not  yet available, hut     sufficient  can be quoted to  afford a provisional idea of the     extent  and  nature of the trade depression for the year as a     whole.   Our overseas  trade  for  the  year has suffered most     severely, exports of domestic production declining by 21.8% (as     compared with  1929) re-exports by 20.7$ and imports by 14.4$.     The  above figures relate to  values and  have therefore to be read     in connection  with the general decline  in prices which has     brought the wholesale  prices index (B.T. with 1924 as standard     at 100) from 83.1 in December 1928 and  79.7 in December  1929, to     65.5 in December 1930.         Figures of  employment show  that the decline between     December 16, 1929, and December  22,  1930, in the number  ef     insured persons  estimated to be  ^in employment was 3 per  cent.     Railway traffic  receipts for the whole  year show a decline of     5f$, and the volume of general business as indicated by  the     Bankers&apos; Clearing House figures  has  suffered by the relatively     small  amount of  2.9%.    Provincial Clearing Houses, however,     show a  falling off in  turnover of 15.6$ as compared with 1929,     December has brought no improvement  in  the general situation and     the  seasonal increase  in unemployment,  bringing the figures to     2,643,127  on December  29, has been heavier and more prolonged     than usual.   As regards the  prospects for 1931,  such  signs     of promise  as  are visible unfortunately appear to be  fewer and     of  less importance  than signs of adverse  conditions.         In the coal trade the  steps which  are being taken  to put     into operation the Coal Mines Act are causing some local changes
in production and certain difficulties experienced inconnection with the change in hours have resulted in a  betterdemand for coal in districts where either no change was involvedor where it appeared that the change would be made withoutfriction.   The domestic demand for coal has been good, but  theindustrial demand is at a low level.   The export trade remainsdifficult, and further complaint is made of Polish competitionassisted by Government subsidies.   It is reported that efforts are being made to secure a market for Polish coal in Irelandand even in London.     The total number of blast furnaces in Great Britainworking at the end of the year 1930 was only 76, not including11 furnaces damped down, as compared with the figure of 162* atthe beginning of the year.   In Scotland at the end ofDecember, there were actually only 5 blast furnaces inoperation.   Special mention was made of competition fromGermany, which is offering hard steel billets such as are muchused in Sheffield trades at  5,13.9d per ton delivered inSheffield, the British price for billets of the same quality being&apos; 7.10/-.   The home price in Germany for this steel is understood to be  7.5/-, with a rebate for German consumers who convertthem into steel for export.     Tinplate manufacturers in Swansea have been working atunder 50% capacity, but an improvement is expected shortly.Galvanised wire manufacturers experienced a further decline, butexpect some recovery before long.  ^ 2*or engineering the year has been the worst statistically since 1924 at least, and theoutlook has never been more unpromising.   An analysis of theexport trade figures shows a considerable decline in exports ofmachinery, especially in  the case of prime movers and textilemachinery.   Increases are, however, recorded in boilers and               *The highest figure  since the War.                               -2-
boiler house plant, and in electrical machinery.    Imports ofmachinery also declined, but to a less extent than the exports;the total figures for the year are as follows:-     Exports, 431,000 tons, valued at  45,928,000j     Retained Imports, 101,000 tons, valued at  16,355,000.     Exports of nev) motor ships have, however, greatlyincreased - from 74,420 tons gross in 1929 to 356,010 tonsgross in 1930.     ihe figures of unemployment among the iiembers of theUnited Kingdom Union of Foundry Workers, which reflect very well the general position of the iron and steel and engineering trades, show an increase in the 12 months ending December, 1930,from 9.34 to 29.38.     A comparison ox the unemployment position in theengineering industry as between November, 1929, and November,1930, shows a general increase from 9% to 20$, which is concentrated in the North-Eastern, North-Western and Scottishdistricts and In marine engineering (27.9o)*  constructionalengineering (23.2$) and general engineering (22.3$).   Thepercentage remains lower in electrical engineering and themetor industry, but in these it is two or three times what itwas in 1929.   The worst unemployment is in general engineeringin the North-Western area, where one out of every three workersis unemployed.     The motor industry has during 1930 been  able to increasethe balance of exports over iaports by nearly  2,000,000 andthe total sales have been probably only some  7-i below 1929.Conditions have become more difficult tov/ards the end of theyear and prospects are very difficult to visualise.   Tariffhelp as at -present given in New Zealand ^o-old be most valuableif ext-ended tn other parts of  the Empire, as  this, it isstated,, v/ould put  the &quot;United Kingdom-industry in  a position to quote prices which&quot;would enable It very rapidly to capture
foreign markets.   Reference was also made to special combinedefforts to place motor cars on the S, American market to compete with the American care.     During the last quarter of 1930 the heavy engineering sideof the electrical industry has fared badly and demand forgenerating plant has been practically dead and that for motorsand switchgear- very bad owing to the general industrialdepression.   The grid scheme has provided a certain amount ofwork especially in respect of cables, with a result that  cablebusiness has shown slightly greater sales in 1930 than in 1929and cable makers&apos; demands for lead have been more encouragingof late.     The sales of general electrical commodities mainly of domestic consumption, though seasonally increasing in the last quarter of 1930, did not reach the corresponding figures  for1929.   Electricity generated during 1930 showed an increase of5,6$ only over 1929, as compared with an increase of 13.5$betY/een the years 1928 and 1929, and of 10.5$ between 1927 and1928.     Exports of electrical goods after a marked recovery in 1929showed a small decline during the first three quarters of 1930and a substantial one during the last quarter and we are stillbehind the United States and Germany in this respect.   It waspointed out that German wages in this industry after therecent reduction are only 57$ of the British.     The shipping freight index for December, 1930, was somewhat higher at  89.86 per cent.   There has been a considerable demandfor tonnage in South America and there is a scarcity of tonnage in the East and Australia,though freights remain very low.     The position in regard to laid-up tonnage remains without much change;  certain shipowners prefer to navigate their ships at a loss  rather than continue the cost of laying up.
f art     Wheat has been very weak during December.   The co-operativeand Governmental efforts to keep up prices in Canada and theUnited States of America are not meeting with success and thetendency appears to be for them to relax.   Russian wheat is still being stored in the United Kingdom and European ports and itsprice remains low,.   Very low prices rule for Indian and australian wheat;  good crops have been harvested in the argentine and must come on the market soon.     The Colonial Office representative reported that the refusal of the Gold Coast native cocoa producers to sell theirproduce had been overcome on their being shown that the figureoffered by the buying Companies was not unreasonable.   Theproblem of the disposal of the very large sugar surplus still remained.     The price of raw cotton fell further during the month ofDecember and ended the year at 5.34d for middling American;  tradefollowed the same declining tendency.   No material change was reported in overseas markets and the boycott of &quot;foreign&quot; goodsremains strong in India.     In December the worsted section of the wool trade has beena little better employed, but there was a slight falling off inthe woollen section and the industry as a whole remains much belSiW.normal.   Reference was made to the steps which have been takento concentrate production by closing certain establishments.During the year exports of woollen and worsted tissues have fallenconsiderably, but imports have actually increased in volume, the imported tissues coming mainly from Western Europe and beinggenerally of a lighter character than those made in England.     Complaint was made of the too slow reduction of retail prices to keep step with the heavy falls in wholesale prices.It was mentioned, however, that retail prices of manufacturedgoods are to some extent kept up by the exigencies offashion or taste which necessitate the placing of small orders for
any given variety of goods instead of large &quot;bulk orders forthe same material.     In the hosiery trade conditions generally have njotimproved.   In  Nottingham, however, it is felt that prices havetouched &quot;bottom and it is hoped, therefore, that improvedconditions will soon result.   Other centres complain of the increasing volume of cheap foreign imported goods, andLOughborough complains specifically of the increased Canadiantariff, which they state has helped to make 1930 the worst yearexperienced during the present century.     In the hoot and shoe trade the outlook is not encouraging,though some improvement is reported from Northampton.     Co-operative trading shows a general decrease 6f 9.3% in value when December 1930 is compared with December 1929, but agood deal of that decrease is accounted for by the fall ofprices;  in the case of flour,though the sales are down by 163,000 or 28.6%, the volume of trade 334,000 sacks is 3.4;&amp; up.     Returns from the larger departmental stores show that,although aggregate sales have decreased in value,there was anincrease in the actual volume of goods sold.   In the Christmastrade the tendency was for a greater number of individualpurchasers, but a less aggregate turnover,   &quot;tfhile expenditure during the second half of the year on women&apos;s clothing was maintained? men/ s and boys&apos; wear have not been so good;  thefurniture departments appear to have been the worst.     Railway Traffic Receipts for December  show an aggregatedecline  of 5f:$ as compared with December, 1929, which  is lessthan the corresponding decrease for November (7^).   Thiscomparatively good  result was due to an increase  in  the movementof  coal  attributed  to colder weather.   The decrease in  thereceipts for the carriage of general merchandise was over  10;:s.The year&apos;s working  as a whole  shows  the sane decrease  asDecember, viz. 5^S,  the decrease  for merchandise  alone,  excluding
   coal and coke, being 7-g$.   From the point of view of the   railways the  prospects for 1931  cannot be said to be at all   bright when-  regard is had to  the stoppages in the coal and   cotton industries and increasing unemployment figures.        As regards  the monetary  situation,  withdrawal of gold   from the Bank of England on French account continues and the   reserve fell  to   147.6 million at the end of 1930;  French   buyers have also taken nearly all the fine gold  which has been   received in England from South Africa.   The reduction in the   Bank rates of the Bank of France and of  the Federal Reserve   Bank of New York should tend  to  check the out-flow of gold, but   the possibility  of higher interest rates in this country remains.        In Australia the quotation for exchange transactions is   on the basis  of  a rate of  115 Australian for  100 in London.*   Complaint is  made of the adverse effect  of Australian   restrictions  on  our engineering  and spelter industries.        Good results for British export trade and for British   shipping are  hoped for from the  Prince  of Wales&apos;s further visit   to South America and the British Exhibition at Buenos Ayres.

Meeting of the Board of Trade Advisory Council       Thursday, 8th January, 1951.     CHAIRMANl (MR. W.R. SMITH, M.P.):  I have to apologise toyou for the absenoe of the President who is engaged at aCabinet meeting with regard to a very important subject, and Iam sure that you will readily excuse his not being here thismorning in those circumstances.  I have again to refer to thepoint raised by the President last time that we should justdraw attention to the reports sent in and deal generally withthe subjects mentioned in them;  they will be circulated later on.  I think that will be for the general convenience ofmembers and will enable them to get away when they haveother important engagements to attend to.  I will oall first ofall upon Mr. Rowland.                       ENGINEERING.     MR. ROWLAND; The report I submitted to you a few days ago*draws attention uirf ortunately to the faot that 1950 was one ofthe worst industrial trading years in recent times, I might, infact say the worst year since 1924,  In regard to the future&apos;.,the outlook seems even more unpromising, and it is impossible to predict what the trend will be in 1931.  The November tradereturns show a further decrease^compared with October, andthere has been an increase in unemployment.     The exports of machinery for the 11 months of the year show a decrease as compared with the previous period of roughly15$.  Inore&amp;ses are to be recorded however in boilers andboiler house plant, in electrical machinery and in cranes andlifting machinery.  The average value of the exports hasIncreased to  97,6 per ton so that the decline in the total value shows a slightly less proportionate decrease in comparisonwith that in tonnage.  The export of complete locomotives shows a gratifying increase in tonnage (32$) and value (20$), butthere was a decrease in the value of locomotive parts exportedwhich makes the aggregate value of locomotives and partsexported rather less for 1930 than for 1929.  The grossimports of machinery are slightly reduced.  They fell short ofthe corresponding amount in 1929 by 6,000 tons.  marine engineering shows the greatest percentage.EMPLOYMENT.      MR. HILTON;  In unemployment the numbers on the registers during December showed a little increase in thefirst week and then remained fairly steady for the kexttwo weeks, and as we approached Christmas there were rapidrises on the last Ws* Mondays in the month.   We alwaysexpect such rises about Christmas time and this year theywere accentuated more than ordinarily.   They are due largely to the extension of the Christmas holidays.   On the 29th*See Appendix p.45,
December the total had risen to 2,643,000 as compared with ,285,000 a month earlier, an increase of 357,000.   Thenumbers wholly unemployed increased by 103,000 and thenumbers temporarily unemployed were increased by 253,000, andthat is owing to the extension of the Christmas holidays.The increase in the monthly period was 236,000 for men,105,000 for women and 15,000 for juveniles.   The divisionalfigures show that there was a pro-portionate increase duringthe month over all parts  of the kingdom.   Apart from thisheavy increase in our unemployment due to the extendedholidays the industries remained pretty much the same.  Coalmining showed little change over the month, remaining bad;iron and steel showed little change, still very bad;  thecotton trade showed seme improvement early in the month butthere was a sharp rise about Christmas time;  the potterytrade showed the usual falling off after the completion *fthe Christmas orders.   The number  of insured persons inemployment at 22nd December 1930 is estimated provisionallyto be about 100,000 less than a month earlier and 812,000 lessthan a year earlier.     CHiiIPh.AH:  The stand-off for the holidays has been rather more extensive this year?     MR. HILTON.  Yes, it began earlier and lasted longer.     MR. HAMILTON:  With regard to the woollen and worstedindustry there has been practically no change during Decemberas compared with November.   The worsted section has beenslightly better employed, and the trade in the wool sectionhas fallen off slightly.  Regarding the year 1930 as a wholeit has been an extreme^ unsatisfactory one.  Prices of woolshave been falling steadily the whole year.  Merino wool has fallen 25;-$ and Crossbred wool 40fo during the past twelvemonths.  The yield of the previous year&apos;s clip was about 57,000,000 sterling;  the year ending June last yielded only about  34,000,000 sterling - a very considerable drop, andwith the still further reduced prices the yield for thepresent season&apos;s clip is going to be a very small one - a lowrecord I imagine. In manufactured goods there were two mostnoticeable features.   The home trade has been fairly steadyand there has been a considerable falling off in the exporttrade.  During the first 11 months of 1929 we exported 144million square yards.  During the corresponding period lastyear we only exported about 106 million square ,-ards.  On theother hand our imports of manufactured goods have actuallygone up slightly from 35 million square yards to 38 million square yards.  The export trade used to account for about 50%of our total trade.  That was the figure generally accepted,but to-day it only accounts for about  25$.   The main importscome from the near Continental countries, and the goods whichwe import, taking them generally, are of a lighter andflimsier character than those that are manufactured in England.The fashion is changing so rapidly nowadays that instead ofbeing able to place bulk orders of say 100 or 200 pieces of ashade it is a case now of two or three pieces.   That ofcourse means that the industry is not conducted on quite as
economic a basis as it used to be.    Of course that affectstae whole world and also accounts partly for the reason whyretail prices have not followed wholesale prices in response to the drop in wholesale prices to the extent that might havebeen expected.   At the same time - this is perhaps rather acontentious point - we in the wholesale end of the trade dothink that there should have been a more rapid reduction ofprices at the retail end, and it appears to us that nearly allthe profit is sticking to the retail end of the trade.  I thinktnat statement has been somewhat supported by one of the Go-operative members a short time ago when he stated that thepercentage of profit at the retail end of the trade was better now that it used to be.  I have to say that that isa very general feeling in the wholesale end of the trade.We are hoping that next year things will be rather better.There is every probability that all the wool grown will beused up, that finer and heavier cloths will be put on to themarket and there will be no surplus of wool, whatever theprice may be.     MR. CAIRNS:  I notice that Sir Auckland Geddes putforward a theory that the absence of fall in retail prices was due to the subconsciousness on the part of the retail trade that prices ought not to come down, that they required allthat they could get and they had to meet heavy taxation.     MR. HAMILTON.  I suppose the wholesaler has to paytaxation as well.  It would apply all round.     CHAIRMAN:  There is a general feeling in many of the manufacturing industries that supply direct to shops that theprofits on the retail side are very high.   How far it is justified by fact I do not know.     MR. CAIRNS:  Bread affords a very good test.  In pre-wardays the price of bread was regulated on a scale according tothe price of flour; if that was the case to-day the bread wouldbe lower than it is in price.  I know this, that if they used the old scale, the 4 lb. loaf would be Id. cheaper than it isto-day.     SIR WOODMAN BURBIDGE:  I am quite sure that retail prices are considerably down and that the retailers are not makingmore money in the way of profit.     MR. HAMILTON:  The retail prices were a long time instarting to come down.  We had a very long start and have a lotto catch up.  We have been coming down for three years.COLONIAL TRADE.     MR. CLAUSON:  I have put in the usual figures for theColonial trade.   The figures do not contain quite so muchnew material as usual.  The general tendency is,  I am afraid,unaltered and not at all satisfactory.     As regards the cocoa hold up in the Gold Coast to whichI referred last month,* all cocoa in the Gold Coast is grown by*See page 25 of Minutes for the Meeting of December 11th.
f I ijX X iinative farmers and when the new crop came forward they foundthat prices had tumbled considerably since last season,  andthe Gold coast and Ashanti Cocoa Association was formed withthe deliberate object of holding up the prices.  They said they would not sell under 25/- a load, which is roughlyequivalent to  57 a ton ci.f. some port in England, and thecurrent price was about  29 a ton c. i.f. or 10/- a load;there was almost a complete hold-up.   The reason given, and apparently the correct one, was that the producers got it into their heads that the &quot;fool were giving them quite anunnecessarily low price.  They were rather reinforced in thatidea by the discreditable reports concerning &apos;United Africas&apos;,which were read with great avidity.  &quot;We pointed out to theGovernor, and he handed on to the Association,  the fact thatin the first place United Africas* recent report showed thattheir profits on a capital of  13 million were at the rateof 1/S  for last year, avid we sent him a whole string of figures showing that other primary products had come downmore than cocoa had.  The result was very gratifyingconsidering that the growers are mostly illiterate and natives.They are seeing the light and are now taking steps to put the crop gradually on the market.  I do not know at whatfigure^  but there are some signs that they are going to sellat what they can get.  Sugar, I am afraid, is still very unsatisfactory.  Some of our sugar colonies are likely to goon the dole and get a grant-in-aid before very long.  Thelast season ended with a surplus of 3,000,000 tons.  That isthe world surplus.  The production for the 1930-1931 seasonis estimated at about lg million more than that of theprevious year.  There was a conference of sugar producers inAmsterdam trying to produce some scheme, but that has broken down because Germany claims to be allowed to export more than ever before.*  The Dutch Indies producers&apos; organisation isbreaking up in consequence.  It is very difficult to see what we can do until some ox the uneconomic producers areshaken out.   You might say we might start an &quot;::jat moresweets&quot; campaign.  I know a great many of you believe inadvertising.   That was all right for the fruit merchants,they got in first, and they said their movement had gone backto the Garden of Taden, but it has got a bit thinner since,and with a surplus of 3,000,000 tons &quot;of sugar,  if you takeonly l/- a pound as the cost of sweets which would be of onlyinferior quality, you would have to get people to spend 336,000,000 to dispose of your surplus, and that is halfof what has been invested in National Savings Certificatesin 14-1 years.  If you take the ordinary juvenile budget of expenditure on sweets that means seven years to clear offthe surplus.  I cannot see what is going to happen to sugar,it is a very bad situation indeed.IRON AND STgEL.     MR.  CHADVICK:  My report has to do with those peopleengaged on the production of castings of iron and steel.^Apparently there is now a prospect of agreement with Germany   on the lines of an increased export quota for her.
The position in regard to production of castings has become very much worse than it was a year ago.  There has been a steady increase month by month from December 1929 in thenumber of unemployed.  Nor is it confined to any givendistricts.  It can be said to be general in Its applicationcovering the whole of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.The average unemployed at the end of December 1929 out ofthe number working in this trade to the extent of 28,000men - that is actually in the line of production - was something like 9.54.  At the end of December 1930 it had risen to 29.38;  the details are given in the annexedtables of figures of membership and unemployed in theNational Union of Foundry workers, from a perusal of whichit will be understood what has taken place during thelast 12 months in this particular line of industry.  Thefollowing are the different sections of trade affected -machine tools, electrical engineering, motor industry,textile machinery, locomotives, building, both contract and railway workshops, general engineering, marine engineering and a section of the light casting industry.It could be said that the figures quoted have their reflexin every branch    the engineering and shipbuilding industry In Great Britain and Northern Ireland.     CHAIRMAN:  Would those figures as far as iron andsteel are concerned be In regard to pig iron and steelcastings?  Would the reduction in production be comparable with those figures of unemployment?     MR. CHADWICK:  Yes.     CHAIRMAN:  Has the output fallen to that extent duringtwelve months?^     MR. CHADWICK:  Yes.     CHAIRMAN:  I did not think the figures bore that out.Was it the change of method?     MR. CKADWICK:   There was a change of method, castingsof a lighter grade being produced than formerly, but onthe whole whatever change has taken place in regard to theindustry generally I think it can be truly  said that thereare a greater  number working inside the trade  in the periodof the Jast 10 to 14 years than there were previously, andthe question of the output would be affected that way.IRON AND STEEL.     MR. WALMSLEY:  It is too early in the month to give you actual production figures or foreign trade figures, butthe indications are pretty clear that production in Decemberin this country was the lowest of any month in the year.The number of blast furnaces working, which has declined from 162 at the beginning of the year to 92 at the end ofNovember, further declined by at least 12 during December.* Appendix page 2s *
illIn the case of 8, however,  the furnaces are  at present onlydamped down, that is not actually blown out,  which means that for the period at any rate they can be  promptly revivedif the demand justifies it.   It is estimated that productionof pig iron in December was about 350,000 tons and of steel370,000 tons, which is a bad fall again compared with theprevious months.  The makers of Cleveland Foundry pig ironreduced their price 5/- per ton, bringing it to 58s.6d. perton.   &quot;Whether that was a very wise  step or  not I am notprepared to say, but it was a policy of desperation.  Itwas essential that the makers of foundry iron in theCleveland and North-Eastern Districts should keep their number of blast furnaces going, otherwise it would upset the balance of their production, and stocks  have beenmounting up so that they were practically compelled to make some effort to meet competition from abroad.   What theresult will be I do not know.  There is no doubt that theyear 1930, (figures are not yet available, but I hope togive them in detail next month) is one of the worst we havehad for eight or nine years.  Of course 1926 was actuallythe worst.  Order books are still declining,  the work whichis being executed is not being replaced by fresh orders.That is simply a repetition of what I have had to say forsome months past.   Long holidays have been  taken at mostof the steel works owing to the lack of orders.  The worldposition does not show any particular change.  The export market is still very dull, and until there is a distinctrevival in such countries as China, Australia, and India,I am afraid we cannot hope to see very much improvement inthe export market generally.  Imports of pig iron and steelinto this country continue on a heavy scale,  and I think  theimports of steel will probably show an increase during thenext two or three months as no doubt large purchases weremade from the Continent during their period of very low prices.  Those prices are steady.  There has not been anyfurther advance.  It is a little too early after the holidays to test actual prices, but I think they are justabout being maintained with a slight increase which tookplace during December.   I have heard only this morning that german hard billets containing .85 per cent,  carbon, whichis a quality very largely used in the Sheffield trades, arebeing offered in Sheffield at  5.13.9d. delivered.  TheBritish price to-day for billets of that quality is about 7.10s,   I believe the home price in Germany for the samequality of billets is about  7,5s. and they grant a rebate to consumers of those billets in Germany who convert them intosteel which is sold abroad.  Evidently the Germans aremaking a special drive.  As a matter of fact I was told that one of the Directors of one of the big works in germany was actually in Sheffield on Monday and Tuesday, going roundpersonally making a big drive at this particular trade inSheffield.  There is no doubt they can do the quality all right and, although I have no information as to what success hehas had, you may be sure that ne will sell some billets if hecan offer them at that price.     MR. HAMILTON:  There is one point arising on Mr.Walmsley&apos;remarks.  The 8th of the month is rather early to give a  reportof what has happened in the previous month,   A lot of statistics are not available by then,  I should think thatapplies to a good many industries.
     MR. Y/.R. SMITH:  In that respect I think that thismonth we are a little unfortunate because we are meeting onthe earliest day of the month possible for the secondThursday.  It would usually be later than this, and I do not know whether that constitutes any need for consideration ofthe date.     MR. HAMILTON:  I think that anything up to the 15th is rather early.     MR. \v.R. SMITH:  I understand this has been considered and it was felt that the 8th would be as good as the 15th.It is a point, however, which can be borne in mind.  If thereshould be any difficulties we can raise it again.     MR. L&amp;INOX lL li  I have a general Report which I willhand in.  Otherwise there is nothing that I need say.COAL.     MR. MITCHELL:  I will read the Report on the coal trade in Scotland.  As regards the rest of my report I willsimply hand in a statement.*     A large proportion of the miners in Scotland were on strike for one week at the beginning of December on thecoming into force of the new Coal Mines Act.  A temporaryagreement has been made for the period to the end ofFebruary and work is proceeding on the basis of eleven daysper fortnight of eight hours per day, without any alteration in wages.   Discussions are taking place regarding a permanentagreement.     A short day on Saturday would not suit the conditionsin Scotland, where there is a large use of machinery andintensive mining.  If places are not cleaned up each day,work for the following day is lost.  It is quite obviousthat if you have a short day and do not clean up the place,you do not get full work on the next day.     The workmen in Scotland for many years fought for a working policy of eleven days per fortnight, and in the pastit was only where special conditions existed that formalpermission was given to work twelve days.  The collierieswhich were working twelve days will suffer by the new arrangement.     No business is being done for export for forwarddelivery, and the prospects of the&quot;trade are poor.  Poland isstill taking a large proportion of the Scandinavian orders.It is now reported that an effort is being made to securetrade in Ireland, and coal has also been offered from Polandin London.  It is impossible for the industry to reeove-rbusiness which is secured by Government subsidies such asexist in Poland at the present tjme.  For January there hasbeen a fair booking of business,&quot;partly due to the fear of astrike in South Vales and trouble in Germany.     The home demand is very unpromising as the steel works and iron works are using very much less coal than under normalconditions.* See Appendix page 42.
     DiBOUBBions are proceeding regarding arrangements tobe made under the new Marketing Sohemeo,  The quotas of produc-tion have been fixed.     The loss in the Scottish coal trade for October was.23 pence per ton, and for November there was a credit of3.16 pence per ton.  The loss for the quarter to 30th september was 8.28 pence per ton.IRON AND STEEL.     As regards pig iron, Mr. Walmsley has already reported the general position.  I may Bay that in Scotland only fiveblast furnaces were in operation at the end of December.  Twofurnaces were only damped down and are now resuming, work, butanother may be blown out.  The production of pig iron inNovember was only 22,100 tons, as compared with 54,600 tons inNovember, 1929.     As regards the tube trade, there ic no improvement, 8Jidthe works are getting much short time.  The exports toAustralia continue to be very small.     MR. W.R. SMITH:  When I asked Mr. Ohadwiok to give his report, I ought to have welcomed him as a new Member of thisCouncil.  I am sure that we are pleased to have him as a Member.The same applies to Mr. Benton Joneor whom I will now ask togive his report,COAL.     MR. BENTON JONES.  The average output of coal for thethirteen weeks from September 27th to the 20th December was,849,000 tons as compared with 5,293,000 tons for thecorresponding, period last year, an average decrease of444,000 tons a week.     The unemployment for the month of November was 21.1 percent, as against 26.5 per cent, in October, and an average of16.2 per cent, in 1929.  The quantity of coal exported fromthe United Kingdom, excluding the Irish Free State, in november was 3,865,910 tons, as compared with 4,568,942 tons in October,(a decrease of 703,032 tons) and 5,197,544 tons in november last year (a decrease of 1,331,634 tons).  That is a bigdecrease in the export of coal.  The decrease must have beenspread over all the markets, and other coal-producing countrieswhich export coal similarly have reductions in the quantity ofcoal exported.     The price per  ton f.o.b. in November was 16/2d. ascompared with 16/4d. in October.     The Central Council and District Boards, formed underthe Coal Mines Act  are now in operation.  The first function of these Boards is  to estimate the quantity of coal which canbe disposed of for  the country as a whole, and thereafter to allocate this quantity among the several districts and among
the individual undertakings.  The first allocation &quot;has beenmade for the quarter ending ?lst March.  In effect theeeallocations divide the prospective trade among the collieryundertakings of the country instead of leaving it to becompeted for.  The allocations will therefore&quot;involve some changes in the rate of production of different undertakings and in the employment which they provide.  The secondfunction of the Central Council and the District Boardsconcerns the price of coal.  This is a much more complicatedmatter, and will take longer to put into operation, and theeffect of it is somewhat uncertain.     The alteration of hours which came into  operation on the1st December, and tie difficulties experienced in  connexionwith the change, have resulted in a better demand  for coalin districts where either no change was involved,  or whereit appeared that the change would be made without  friction,because of the fear of the suspension of production indistricts where friction was anticipated.     The demand for domestic purposes has been stimulated by the inclement&quot;weather, but the inland demand for industrial purposes and especially for the iron and steel industry is ata  low  level.  The export demand from the Eumber isexceptionally low.     MR. W.R, SMITE:  We also have to welcome Mr.  Holt  as  anew Member of the Council.SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.     MR. HOLT:  I have not prepared any Report on this occasion, because it is my first attendance here, and I didnot know what line to take, but I see from the list of theAdvisory Council that Lsr. Hose has retired, and if It is yourwish I will endeavour in future to follow the lines he took,and also g,ive the Council any other information that might be useful.    As you know, the South American countries are sufferingfrom what we are suffering from here - extravagance andover-expenditure - and that has brought about inflation, whichhas, of course, affected their spending power, and has verymuch reduced our trade witl those countries.  One result has been that they have been suffering from a series ofrevolutions.  Fortunately the revolutions have thrown to the surface a very much better class of man, end v/e have greathopes  that both the trade and the financial arrangements ofthose  countries will improve in the next few years.     The great British Public Utility Companies have, ofcourse, been suffering very severely, and I expect that ourRevenue Authorities-, understand 8,nd appreciate that during thenext two ye.o,rs the amount that they will be able to collectin the shape of Income Tax and Super-Tax from the shareholdersof these undertakingo will be very much reduced.  I should say that the Government in their own collections must look at least for a reduction at the rate of about  1,000,000 ayear .
     &quot;We are 8.11 hoping that the British Empire TradeExhibition at Buenos Aires, which takes place in March next,will give a. great fillip - not perhaps an immediate fillip,but in the future - to our trade in South America generally,and I think it will.     Touching on that there is one interesting matter whichhas evolved from the information I have received.  One ofthe great directions of expenditure in these last few years in the South American countries has been upon motor cars,and lorries,  I think that Great Britain has been holdingits own as far as lorries are concerned, but we have not had a large share in the motorcar business, which has beenextraordinarily valuable;  but you will perhaps be interested to hear that there is a very strong combination here to tackle this business; two English motorcars are going to beput on the South American and other foreign markets, which,I think, are likely to be able to compete with the Americancars and so obtain for uo our proper share in that bigbusiness at present, and in the future.DISTRIBUTIVE TRADE.     SIR WOODMAN BURBIDGF: I will put in a table&apos;&quot; for November tra.de.  It is based on returns from 166 differentstores, almost double the number reporting for August, when these figures first began to be collected.     In November sales we are down by 5.9 per cent., thoughallowance has to be made for one working day less in themonth as compared with the previous year,     (At this point the President of the Board of Trade        joined the Council and took the Chair).     For the four months to the end of November of the half-year commencing 1st August, sales are down by 4.1 per cent.as compared with *.5 per cent, at the end of October.  Thesefigures bring out three tendencies which have been operatingthroughout the ye ar;-     1, The Departments dealing with women&apos;s wear alone         have been able to maintain, and slightly         increase, their figures.     2. The Furniture Departments have been exceedingly         difficult, and to a less extent Men&apos;s and Boys&apos;         we ar.     2. Results in London have been less favourable than         in other parts of the country.     There can be no reason to doubt that although thevolume of sales has fallen as compared with last year, the physical volume of goods passing into consumption has actually increased.*See Appendix p. 19 .
     Since the end of November,  1929,  the Cost  of Living Indexfell by 7.2 per cent, and for food alone by 11.3 per cent.Unfortunately, this Index does not satisfactorily represent  thefall which has taken place in retail prices, and fron independentinquiries which have been made there is reason to suppose thatin the merchandise covered by these figures prices have fallen by at leaot 10 per cent.     Unfortunately it is still too early Ito give any reliableindication of trade during December, but the preliminary figuressuggest that a further fall of about 6 per oont. in turnover maybe expected over the country as a whole.   It can only be repeated that this fall is fully accounted for by the fact that apart fronthe fall in prices there appears to be definitely less money to spend in Stores doing a medium to high-class trade,  The effectof those two factors on the Christmas trade is well illustrated by the experience of the group of Panoy Departments in a West EndStore doing a medium trade, in other words the Departments wv:erea good proportion of tho Christmas trade is done. During the threeweeks before Christmas 10,000 more customers were served, but thetotal cash value of the sales was less by  51, than for tho saneperiod last year.   You may be interested in our own store.For the nine days against the ten days before Ohristmas last yearwe served 29,000 more cuotonerB and yet our trade was  3,000 down.Stores doing a better class trade are bound to feel the effect of so many companies this year either reducing or  passing theirdividends.  The popular type of store, on the other hand, has notyet been so seriously affected.     MR. HILTON:  Are you quit&amp; sure that the greater fall Inprices that you suggest in food and in all  Items, greater thanthat shown by the official index number, is really applicable toall shops?    The prices quoted by the Ministry of Labour arecollected from thousands of working class shops all over thecountry.    I wondered whether  this was  a difference between thefall in prices at what are called chain  or  multiple stores, andthe fall in prices  over all types of working class  shops.  Is itlarger stores that  you are thinking of?     SIR WOODMAN BURBIDGE:   My figures  only represent  the lar^eretail stores.    I  do not deal with the Co-operative Stores,or  small v.;ultiple  shops.     MR. HILTON:  What you say  does not  necessarily imply thatthe official  Index  Number which is based upon figures representativeof  all shops  including  the smaller working  class  shops  is  incorrectas  a measure  of the general fall  in working-class prioes?     SIR WOODMAN BURBIDGEj  My  figure  would not  include all thesmall  shops.CO-OPERATIVE TRADE IN SCOTLAND.     MR.  CAIRNS:  My statement for this month is abridged bythe action of the holidays in Scotland which so far as  the factories are concerned affected the end of last week and thebeginning of this and from several of the factories the oustonaryreoorts have not been received.
99hi hi     The trade in dried fruit occupies an important positionin the last month of the ye.,r and with the fulfilment  of thespecial demand created by the festive season the  remainingstocks appear to be inadequate for that of the  present and ofthe immediate future, as indicated by an advance  in the pricesof various kinds such as Sultanas, Oalifornian  raisins andprunes.     For eggs the market has been lifeless throughout  the month and prices have fallen a little during the period.     Though the price of sugar is still substantially  less thanit was a year ago the market is very unsettled  and exhibitsviolent fluctuations.   These are held to be due  to the uncertainty of what may happen from the International  SugarConference whioh met in Brussels on 9th December, and  attained,it is said, an approximate settlement of the respective quotaswhich have to be exported in the next five years  by the variousoountries, with the exception of Germany, which refused toaccept its allotment.     The Conference was adjourned until the first week inFebruary, and until it is seen whether or not the effortsucceeds to make arrangements for the restriction of  exportswhich will be acceptable to all the countries represented themarket will be subject to the influence of disturbing  rumours.     For butter increased prices were realised during  thesecond half of juecember and Colonial butters especially NewZealand of which the high quality is being generally  recognisedparticipated correspondingly in the advance.     The average increase in the case of New Zealand was 10/-per cwt. and in Danish ll/-.     The reasons given for the increase were the extrarequirements of the festive  season, delay in the discharge of cargoes owing to fogs and the loss of 3,000 casks aboard thesteamer &quot;Oberon&quot;.     Consequent on the comparatively  lower price ruling forbutter the demand for margarine has been much diminished andthe output of our factory is 30 per cent, less than the normal.     An offer has been received from Russia to take for thenext six months the whole quantity renuired to keep the factoryworking at its full capacity but  this we are unwilling toaccept without an arrangement under the Export Credits Sche-e ..of the Government.     Scotch  oatmeal  is inferior to that of last year  owing tothe defective condition in which  the  oats were harvested due tounfavourable weather  and the oatmeal  is low in price.     Still German oatmeal is being offered at prices  fror f3/-to 3/- per cwt.  less  and Canadian is  about the sa^e price asGerman.     Judging from the quantity sold by  Co-operative Societiesrice is an important  food with the people,     Attention was called last month  to the low price  at whichit was being sold.   Since then a  further  reduction has takenplace  and now it  is  being offered at  0/-  per cwt. o.i,f.,Glasgow for  January/February shipment.
     Foreign coarse grains in sympathy with the wheat  marketbecar-ie lower in price last month.    Plate Maize for sh.ipr.entnext month is being offered at slightly under  4 a ton Glasgow,while Plato oats aor*e practically 2/8 a ton less for the sanedate.     Russian barley owing te largo arrivals has receded in price 10/- per ton.     Supplies of fish c*t Aberdeen have been good throughout themonth with moderate prices and our Fish Department there hasexperienced a brisk demand for all kinds.     During the last six months the quantity dispatched by theDepartment to Glasgow and district alone shows an increase of5,673 stones on that for the corresponding period of last year.     The closing of our half-yearly accounting period hasrevealed very unprofitable results in the juto and in thetweod factory,,    The jute industry is the worse of the two and shows for the six months a loss of  28,000.     The cause of this loss is two-fold, depreciation of stocksinfluenced by a falling market and the scarcity of orders withltd accompaniment of underproduction leading to an intensecompetition in prices.     While the botto1&quot;.&apos; appears to be reached in the price of the raw material the demand is far below the normal for every kindof the finished products.     MR. HAMILTON:  What is the credit demanded by Russia today?     MR. CAIRNS: 20 per cent, cash, and 80 per cent, in nine months&apos; bills.     PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE: How does that compare with the ordinary  export credit arrangement for,  I think  it was,margarine?   What  is the normal rate?     MR. CAIRNS;   we have not so far taken advantage of theExport Credits Scheme, and we are going  just about as  far  as wecan go.  Vie would  not like to go any further.CO-OPERATIVE TRADE.     MR.  VARLEYi  The reduction^in prices of goods generallyis having tho effect of reducing the value of our sales,  andfor the four weeks ending 3th December,  compared with I0 months ago,we are 9.3 per cent, down..   The value of our flour trade,for example, is down  153,000 or 28 per cent, from l&apos;J. months agobut the volume is up 3.4 per cent, that  is 334,000 sacks  of280 pounds each or 11,246 sacks more than 12 months ago.   I givethat as an extreme illustration of what  is happening at themoment with reference to foodstuffs generally.     Contrary to the experience of our Scottish friends,  ourmargarine trade is up, and so is our lard.
     The comparison of the wholesale and retail  prices  showsthat the wholesale prioe is down 14.53 per cent, in sugar andthe retail price down 15.39 per cent.    In Butter our  wholesale prices are down 25.85 per cent, and the retail prices 22.92 per&quot;cent.   Flour is down 39.42 per cent, wholesale,  and 24.14 percent, retail.   Bacon is down 34.03 per cent,  wholesale, and3:3.84 per cent, retail.    Butter has the usual  abnormality ofrecent months of Australia and Hew Zealand being down more thantho Danish or Swedish.    For instance, Danish is down  &quot;ls.^d.per hundredweight, on in months ago, Swedish 27/^d,  Finnish 29s,New Zealand 47s, and Australian 47s. as well.    That is Danishis selling at 141s.6d. during December and Auotralian 115s.  Thatis Australian is about 25s. per hundredweight  less than Danioh.     Sugar is awaiting the rosulto of the European Conference.There has been a slight increase of 3d. per hundredweight andthe markets are under the influence of the holidays.     As far as tea is concerned, very little change took placeby the end of the month, the market remaining fully firm for alldescriptions, with auctions rather quieter,     Wheat has been very weak since our last Report, and is downabout 4s. per quarter.     The Pool difficulties in Canada have increased, and the banks have appealed to the Government who are said to haveguaranteed the banks the overdraft allowed to the Pool, butthey have insisted on appointing a new General Manager and thiohas resulted in a change of policy.     In the United States the Farm Board is still supporting thefutures market so far as old crop wheat is ooncerned, but new crop positions are left to the speculator.     In Russia they are selling wheat freely and storing itin public granaries in the United Kingdom and various Europeanports.   The wheat is cheap and keeps wheat from othercountries down in price.     In Australia they are having heavy crops, but low prices have to be taken in competition.   I know that  in Australia the pool is allowing to the farmer as low a price as l/2d.* a bushelfor his wheat, without any expensoc, which is a very low -oriceindeed compared with 5/od. and **s. two years ago.   In india the price is not sufficient to enable growero to pay land revenue much less get a living.    There is serious alam aboutthe ports buying Australian wheat, and efforts are being made  to stop this.     In the Argentine good crops have been harvested and willhave to be sold as storage facilities are quite small.    TheGovernment is adopting a policy of rigid economy owing to thesmall income from the crops.ttThio figure represents tho first advance only and if there  are  any balances beyond this they will be disbursed to tho farmers  at the end of the year.  Mr. Varley adds that the price has  only  been l/2d, for about a fortnight prior to which it had been  l/4d. for so:oe weeks.  Subsequently a report has been received  from Sir Frederick Young (see Appendix page 57 ) stating that a  wheat Advances Bill has passed the Australian Parliament  providing for an advance of 3/- a bushel f,o.b.
    Another rather curious fact is that   the price of  millingoffals is almost the price of the wheat  Itself,  so that  so faras milling offals are concerned at the moment they are a veryprofitable transaction for the miller, fetching nearly as high aprice as the flour.     I have one rather interesting note  here about the Christmaspoultry season.    On the 13th December  the price charged for irish turkeys was l/0%d, and l/ld. per lb. carriage paid, andafter the 13th December there was a rapid advance in price;  infact on the last occasion we had supplies for disposal l/lOd.per lb. was charged, so that there is a  great difference in  price in the later Christmas trade - l/lOd. per lb. free on rail toLlanchester for Irish turkeys and ^any people were getting even higher prices than that.     So far as the general furnishing trade is conoerned, in ourSocieties, business has improved just a little during the month.The toy trade has suffered little decrease during the toy season.     In the general furniture trade there is no improvement.The demand this Christmas has been for small goods and not forthe higher-priced cabinet productions.     So far as domestic coal is concerned, It went up duringthe holidays and it would appear that people were ordering morethan their requirements.    In one district, the Cannook Chasedistrict, the prices have gone up 1   per ton on the 1st January.     The usual tigures* are given in this statement respectingour export to tne Societies in other countries, but I mightjust mention that so far as we are concerned we have accepted anorder for 5,000 tons of margarine to be delivered during thenext six months to Russia.     PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF trade Are there any questions  orany comments on i.r. Varley&apos;s statement?     MR. CLAUSON:  There  is one  question  I  should like to ask.The drop in price of Dominion butter  is very significant.  Hasthat had the effect of  increasing imports?   Are they knockingthe foreigner  out of the market  to any extent?     MR. VA.RI.EYj  Not so far as  our experience is concerned.  Ido not  know what the general experience is, but not so far as our experience  is  concerned.     MR. CLAUSON:   I suppose it  is bound  ,to happen in ti^e?     MR. VARLEY:   It should happen in time.     MR. CLAUSON:   Is the  quality as  good?   Is  it a  comparablequality?     MR. VARLEY:   In the  North of England you can  sell very littlebutter except  Danish.    In London and the South  colonial  utterhas a  better market.*See Appendix p.52.
     MR. CLAUSON:  Perhaps the Empire Marketing Board mightseize upon this disparity in price to do a little pushingof Dominion butter.     PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE:  Yes, they will seethe note.     MR*  CAIRNS:  I may say that for some time the consumptionof New Zealand butter especially has been increasing InScotland.   It is exceedingly good in quality, but unfortunatelywe have not got it on the market in time and the Danish butteris in possession of the market when the New Zealand buttercomes in, so that a lower price has to be accepted for the NewZealand butter In order to get a footing in the market, butthe quality is very very good and the tendency is for more ofit to be consumed and less of Danish, especially in Glasgow.     MR. CHADWIOK:  De I understand that for all foodstuffs,taking them all round, the volume has gone up and the pricehas gone down?     MR. VARLEY:  Taking food generally, yes.   Sugar is down,butter is down, flour is down, tea is about the sane, bacon and hams aro down.    Those are the principal articles of consumption.     MR. CHADNICK:  Down in price?     MR. VARLEY:  In price.     MR. CHADWICK:  But the volume  ...     MR. VARLEY:  The volume is up.WOOL.     ALDERMAN TITTERINGTON:  The decline in wool values in thefirst half of December brought them to the lowest point since1902.   Since then there has been a steadier tone at Bradford,but business remains very quiet.   Wool values are very low,but I think the county characteristic is more than usually inevidence;  everybody is extremely cautious.   Values possiblyare affected by uncertainty in the exchange fluctuations inSouth America, Australia and New Zealand.     Merino combers and botany spinners are fairly well employedon old orders, and stocks of merino.wool, tops and yarns arelight.   The crossbred section is poorly employed, with a large amount of short time and unemployment.     Worsted manufacturers are faring better than woollen manu-facturers, but taking the industry as a whole employment is much below normal and there are no signs of an early expansion, though should imagine the seasonal improvement at the beginning of theyear will possibly come along in the ordinary way, and the policyof concentrating production in fewer establishments has been largelyadopted by the Bradford Dyers&apos; Association, who have closed several
important branches down.  That lead has been followed byWoolcombers Limited, who comb wool, and who are shuttingdown three of their smaller branches.     In- the dyeing industry the employerc have made anapplication for a reduction in wages, which is now havingthe consideration of the Allied Trade Unions.     I will hand in a statement giving statistics relative to the condition of the wool-textile industry-&quot;-.  In doing soI ought to make the observation that there are no publishedfigxires of production, consumption or stocks in the wool-textile trade.  That is a difficulty which I think we are having, to contend with at the present moment.  Those are all the observations I have to make.CHEMICALS.     DR. CLAYTONj As might be expected, the closing monthof the year brought with it very little of outstandinginterest so far as current trade was concerned.  Followingan extended period of increasing depression, the practice of leaving over to the New Year any buying which could conveniently be postponed was more intense, end business was therefore essentially confined to day-to-day orders.So much for the general position.  With the exception of theheavy chemical and dyestuffs section, on which I reportseparately below, the above remarks may be taken to apply tothe individual sections of the industry also.Heavy Chemicals.    The increase in consumption of chemicals reported lastmonth has been maintained, though the relapse in the artificial silk trade still affects sales of chlorine.     Sales in China show some slight recovery from theprevious month and it is hoped that Russian competition isbeing held in check.  Sales in Japan, however, remain at a level indicative of depressed industrial conditions.  InIndia sales continue to be fairly well-maintained, in spiteof political unrest.     Though hydrochloric acid deliveries still remain low,owing to continued depression in the galvanising industry,the slight increase in sulphuric acid consumption previously reported is maintained.     Deliveries of sulphate of ammonia, though showing adecrease from last month, remain fairly satisfactory for thetime of year,Dyestuffs  and Intermediates.     The chemical  Industry  is gratified by  the decision tocontinue the Dyestuffs  (Import Regulation)  Act of 19PQ, toDecember ?lst, 19?1.  It is earnestly hoped that by the*See Appendix  .51,
willing co-operation of all the interests affected it willbe possible during the intervening period to reach agreement as to a course of action which will ensure the continueddevelopment of this Important key Industry without imposingany economic handicap on the userB of dyes.  I can assureyou of the fullest assistance from the chemical Industry inthis matter.     The general trade position remains practicallyunchanged owing- to the Intervention of the Christmas holidaysbut, even so, there is little hepe of amelioration until the textile trade improves-..

BOOTS AND SHOES.     MR.. BOSTOOK sent the following report:-     In most centres the Christmas holidays have  extendedinto the New Year, and factories have not been open long-enough to allow of any great developments.     The general feeling is  that with the New Year thereshould come the customary seasonal improvement, but thegeneral outlook is not encouraging.     In the heavier districts mild weather has checkedthe  demand.  In Northampton County trade is  said to be rather better, but buyers generally are displaying muchcaution in placing orders.     Retail trade is said to have been disappointing inDecember but to have improved somewhat just before Christmas.IRON AND STEEL.MS.

SHIPPING.     SIR ERi-test  GLOVER sent the following report: -     There has been little change in markets generallysince my report of a month ago.   &quot;here has been the usualslowing down of business owing to the holiday period.  TheIndex No. for Freights for December 1930 Is 89.66 as comparedwith 86 for the previous month based on 100 as the fieurefor 1913.                                            &amp;     Outward business for coal, which was on a very small scale, has practically come to a standstill owing to the stoppage in South Wales.     General Cargo outwards.   South America.  Hopes areentertained that the Prince of wales  visit and the forthcomingexhibition will stimulate the demand for -British products.At present this is largely hope, and probably the marketing of the wheat crop will have more actual effect.     East.  With regard to outward cargoes in this direction,there Is practically no change t) report and the situationremains much the same as last month.     Homewards.  Black Sea.  There has been some spasmodicchartering but it is understo^d that a considerable quantityof grain shipped by Russia during the late rush has not yetbeen absorbed.  An grain prices are abnormally low and thismilitates against large shipments.     South America.  In spite of low prices there has beena considerable demand for tonnage.  Hates of freight havefluctuated to a small extent but remain generally on a levelbelow cost price as a sufficient number of steamers are willing to make a loss running rather than an equivalent losslying up.     East.  Scarcity of tonnage still prevails but the small-ness of demand prevents any material advance.  If there were any considerable enquiry steamers would have to go from theMediterranean in ballast.     Australia.  The same remarks as to scarcity of tonnageapply as to the East generally and in addition to marketingdifficulties there is apparently  some misunderstanding and difficulty as to what the Pools are to pay the farmers.  Thelatter are expecting to be paid a price which is all thatwheat will realise in Europe.  Business is therefore held back.     Canada &amp; United States remain without interest.     Shipbuilding.  I have not heard of any orders for over-seas tramps being placed.     Shipment of Coals.  There is not much change.  Shipmentsfor November 1930 were  sligntly  less than for the previous month.   It  Is interesting  to  note, however,  that  shipmentsfor November 1930 were more than  a million tons less than forthe same month  in 1929.                             4     Laid up Tonnage.  The position  remains without muchchanged  Ag indicated above rates from South America andthe other Quarters tempt  some  owners to navigate  at a lossrather  than continue the  cost  of  lying up out the great bulkof the  laid up  tonnage  remains.                             -31-

1 b i1. -J: CJMONEY.     ICR. GOODSNOUGH sent the following reports -     Easy conditions prevailed in the short loan marketthroughout December.   In the early part of that month, marketresources were increased by the distribution of approximately 50 millions in interest on the 5 per cent. War Loan, whilst,towards the close, the large amount borrowed from the Bankof England in preparation for the end of the year requirementscaused day-to-day funds to be abundant prior to December 31st.As repayment to the Bank of England is spread over the firstnine days of January, supplies of credit in the New Year havebeen in excess of demand.   The gold withdrawals from the Bankof England on French account, which recommenced early inNovember, have proceeded almost daily and, mainly for thisreason, the gold held in the Issue Department of the Bank ofEngland, as disclosed in the weekly returns, fell below/  150millions on December 24th for the first time since January 8th,1930.   By December 31st, the figure had declined to  147.millions and should the .gold stocks continue to be heavilydepleted, the possibility of higher interest rates in thiscountry cannot be ignored..  The reduction in the Bank Rate ofthe Bank of France from 2-g- to 2 per cent, on January 2nd,following similar action by the federal Reserve Bank of New Ysrkon December 23rd, should, however, tend to check the outflow,although it is, as yet, too early to estimate the effects ofthese movements upon the demand for gold from abroad.   nearly all the fine gold reaching this country from South Africathroughout the past month has been secured by French buyers.     During the greater part of December, discount quotationsshowed a distinctly firmer tendency, the rate for threemonths&apos; Bank bills rising from 24, to as high as 2-g- per cent.Subsequently, a reaction occurred and, largely owing to the veryeasy monetary conditions at present prevailing, the quotation isnow around 2/^g - 2^ per cent.     For the first time since 1926, the total of clearingsthrough  the Bankers&apos; Clearing House in 1930 showed a decreasecompared with the preceding year, although in view of thepresent position of trade and in&amp;uetry and the lower level ofprices, it Is somewhat surprising that the decline was only .9 per cent.   The influence of the trading depression is,however, more fully reflected in the returns of ProvincialClearing Houses, embracing eleven large towns in England, which show a falling off in turnover of 15.8 per cent, in comparisonwith 1929.     activity in the Foreign Exchange market has increasedslightly, but the expansion&quot; has been mainly due to financialrather than to trading influences.   The minor bankingdifficulties in the United States caused a larger turnover inthe American dollar in the early days of December, while, later,business was increased by the substantial  transfers of fundscustomary at the end of the year.   A depreciation occurred inthe French franc towards the close of December and themovement was assisted by the subsequent reduction in the FrenchBank Rate, although the improvement in sterling was not fullymaintained.   The quotation cf  123.71 on January 5th compares with a low level of 123.50 recorded in December.     Following the action of the Bank of New South Wales inAustralia in altering its quotations for exchange transactionsto a basis corresponding to a telegraphic  transfer rate of  115Australian for  100 London funds, it is reported that the other                                -33-
1/4 llbanks in the Commonwealth have amended their scales of charges.This development is, no doubt, due to the growing amount ofbusiness, which, for some time past, has been conducted outsidethe circle of the Australasian Banks at an increasing rate ofdiscount for the Australian pound.   No official announcementof a change in quotations in London has, however, yet been made.     A feature of the market has been the decline in the valueof the Argentine peso, which, at one time, fell to 34-fd and onJanuary 5th, stood at 35d.     Business on the Stock Exchange has continued of smalldimensions.   Gilt-edged  stocks have again attracted mostattention and quotations  for a number of British government securities have appreciated compared with the beginning ofDecember.   Several new capital issues of an investmentcharacter have appeared, but, on the whole, they have not been so readily absorbed as similar offerings in recent months.     SIR GUY GRANET sent  the following report: -     Seasonal influences  were at work in the Money Marketover the turn of the year.   The keen demand for funds thatwould not be repayable until January owing to the fact thatpractically every Banking and other concern in the Country makesup its Balance Sheet on December 31st caused comparativelyhigh rates to be paid for money lent to January  1st.   The yearend pressure for money was severe and the Discount Market had to borrow about  44,000,000  from the Bank of England in order toreplace the money withdrawn for balance sheet purposes.   Apartfrom this seasonal demand for loans to January 1st, day to daymoney has been 1-g- to 1$,  and since January 1st has frequentlybeen unlendable as the Market has had the use of money borrowedfrom the Bank of England  in addition to the money usually lentby the Banks and finance  institutions, who again sought to employthe funds they had temporarily withdrawn.   Easy rates areexpected to rule until the market has repaid its loans from theBank of England and the inflow of revenue in connection withincome taxes and, to a lesser degree, motor duties have made their payment felt.   After rising to the neighbourhood of 2%jfcin the middle of December the discount rate for three monthsBank Bills fell steadily  to about 27^6^ at the end of that month and the plethora of money available for short investment at thecommencement of this month has forced the rate down to 2g$6.     The reduction of the re-discount rates of the New YorkFederal Reserve Bank and  that of the Bank of France from 2-g$ to2% has encouraged the hope that these reductions may cause moneyto flow to London to the  benefit of the Sterling Exchange withParis and New York-.   It  is, however, not so much ,a question of rate as the uncertainty with which Continental Bankers view theeconomic outlook of this  Country that appears to be exercisingsome influence, and the future of sterling in the Paris Exchangewith its effect on gold shipments will depend to some degree onthe extent to which they  are able to overcome this feeling.     Owing to the holiday season the volume of new capitalissues has been small.    In  the Stock Exchange the gilt edgemarket has kept firm but  the  industrial market has registerednew depths of depression  partly due to  the Coal  and Cotton labour
id 5troubles and partly to the anticipation of a large numberof concerns announcing poor trading returns for the past year.                      ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.     SIR HUGO HIRST sent the following report:-Home Trade.     The conditions ruling in the Electrical Industry ofGreat Britain during the last quarter of 1930 naturallyreflected the depression existing in the basic industries andthe decreased purchasing power of the community.     The general commodity sections as represented by such material as  Lamps, Household Appliances, Wire and Cable,Wireless Apparatus, Fittings, etc.reached their peak demandduring these months, and whilst sales of such articles have followed the usual, seasonal curve, the curve has not reachedthe same level as for 1929, nor has it shewn the same relativeincrease over the Summer demand.     It is of interest to note that the main falling off hasbeen seen in the London area, and particularly in the central london districtss whilst Provincial centres have maintainedor slightly improved upon last year*s results.   The exactre a son f o r this tendency is difficult to ascertain, but itshould be borne in mind that provincial  areas such asLancashire and Yorkshire, South Wales, and the Shipbuildingcentres were already experiencing in 1929 the effects of thedepression in the Cotton and Woollen Industries, the CoalIndustry and Shipbuilding, whilst London enjoyed betterconditions due to the boom on the Stock Exchange whichfinished in that year.   Almost exactly  similar conditionsare to be seen in the returns of the Departmental Storestrade published by the Board of Trade.     Domestic electrification continues  to make progress, butthe rate of progress has not shewn the greater relativeincrease which should be expected in normal  times on accountof the widening facilities for obtaining electrical supply.Wiring material such as Conduit, Cables, Switches and accessories have also slowed up.   This  slowing up isexemplified by the returns of the total  units ef electricitygenerated by authorised Undertakers in Great Britain.   Forthe first ten months of 1928 (January to October) unitsgenerated amounted to 7,233 millions of  units;  for the sameperiod in 1929, to 8,240 millions of units;  and in 1930 to,684 millions of units.   For this period there was, thereforean increase in the first ten months of 1929  as compared with1929 of 1,007 millions or  13.95$,     For the first ten months of 1930 the increase droppedto 444 millions or 5,35$ - a big falling off where normallya greater increase should have been seen.
     The Heavy Engineering side of the Industry has,of course, fared much worse.  The demand for Industrial Motorsand Switchgear has been very bad, orders from the Cotton,  Wooland Steel Industries and from Collieries, being practicallynon-existent.  A certain amount of work for the Grid  scheme has been placed, mainly in the nature of small extensions to existing contracts for apparatus for sub-stations  etc., andthis has helped Switchgear and Transformer makers.  Businesshowever, for generating plant - Turbines, Turbo Generators -is, to all practical purposes, dead - a natural corollary  ofthe Grid and the depression in Industry which has causedpotential buyers of such plant to withhold new capitalexpenditure.     Cable business (as distinct from wiring material)keeps fairly high in spite of the depression.  Nearly allthe contracts for the primary lines have new been settled  bythe Central Electricity Board, only one or two sectionsremaining to be placed.  The following figures shew thetotal sales of the Cable Makers&apos; Association for the  past year as compared with 1929:-                      1930    ...    8,180,000                      1929    ...    7,970,000This is mainly due to Super Tension Cable, arising out of  theGrid, the sales of which were  880,000 in 1930 as against 470,000 in 1929.     The sale of Broadcast Receiving Apparatus is asatisfactory feature, the developaient of apparatus of comparatively moderate price for use on supply mains havinggiven a fresh impetus to the general demand.Export Market.     In 1929 a marked recovery in British ElectricalExports took place, and brought to an end the period  ofdecline which had continued through 1926, 1927 and 1928.For the first nine months of 1930, however, a decline of 63,384 was recorded - from  14,070,198 to  14,006,814. Ofthe three principal exporting countries of electrical apparatusof the Y/orld -Great Britain, U.S.A. and Germany - GreatBritain was the principal exporter in 1927, but fell  to thirdplace in 1928 and 1929, and it would appear will occupyrelatively the same position in 1930, although the marginbetween her and the othec? two countries will be much  smaller.During this period there has been a steady decline in theimportance of the five department&apos;s ions as markets for BritishElectrical goods.  The markets mainly responsible for  this  havebeen Africa and Australia, and whilst some recovery in theformer market has been seen in 1930, it is disappointing Inview of the position that had been reached in Australia to reflect that the operation of the new tariffs is likely toreduce British exports to that country to a very small figureindeed.     In India and other Colonies outside theDominions - such as the Straits Settlements,  Falestiae, british west Indies - our exports have shewn some increase, but it isin the foreign countries that better progress has been achieved.   Although the Argentine in 1929 shewed a decrease ascompared with 1928, this is a market of great importance,  and
the British Electrical Industry will he adequatelyrepresented at the forthcoming exhibition &quot;both by a cosib*i?iedexhibit and by individual exhibits of a large number ofthe principal manufacturers.     In Central and South American markets., a fallin British exports has occurred., due to American financialpenetration.  In China, a decrease in exports must be attributed to the civil wars, although it would appear thata condition nearer stability has, for the moment, beenreached.     Competition in the export mai^kets of the worldremains extremely severe.  Such arrangements as those maderecently in G ermany, where in order to counter-balance thedrop in Home and Export prices, an all round reductionof 10$ in wages and salaries has taken place, intensifiesauch competition.  German  wages compere now with Britishwages in the ratio of 57 to 100.Imports.                                                                      In 1929 the total imports of Electrical Apparatusend Machinery into Great Britain amounted to nearly 3,400,000, an increase over 1928 of almost  2S000,000 or30.25$.

i. o&apos; $     MR. LENNOX LEE handed in the following statement     Trade during December has followed much the same  courseas during November.    The dropping tendency of the rawmaterial has not inspired confidence in buyers.   The  &quot;s-oot&quot;price for Middling American at Liverpool was 5.78d. at thecommencement of the month and at one time it dropped to 5.24d.rising again by the end of the month to 5.34d.   The fall infully good fair Sakeliaridis has been even more pronounced, adecline of l-^d. per lb. being registered during the month.     In consequence of the position in the raw materialMarket a &quot;bearish&quot; tendency has been noticeable in both theyarn and grey cloth sections, and orders have been very limited^     The piece dyers report that no Bigns of improvement arenoticeable, the production being about 70 fa of what it  was 19,months ago, and in the Artificial Silk section the shrinkagein volume is- even more pronounced, and the increasing exports from Japan to India of that commodity is seriously disturbing.     The volume of trade done by bleaching firms has not shown the usual seasonal decline from November, but, as during thelatter month there was an exceptionally low output, the figuresfor December record no very marked improvement.     Reports from the various Overseas Markets do not revealany material change from the conditions prevailing during november.  In India,  Bombay Dealers are still prevented fromliquidating foreign goods openly, although a certain amount  ofliquidation is taking place secretly.   The fear of socialboycott and fines has, however, prevented Dealers from plaaingnew business particularly for printed goods.   The renewal ofthe activities of the Congress pickets in Calcutta has engendereda further lack of confidence and business has been on a very limited scale.  News from up-country also reveals the nervousnesswhich exists in dealing with foreign cloth.   Meanwhile, theIndian Mills, helped by the Boycott and the increase in theImport Duties, are expected to have reached record figuresof production during 1950.  News from Egypt shows that therehas been a slight improvement in demand but the accounts ofmany retail merchants in the provinces are so far behind that  /holesalers are hesitant in giving fresh orders.  In the Southand Central American Markets business has been seriouslyhampered by the falling rate of exchange, and, although cropreports are satisfactory and the surplus for  export likely tobe high, much depends upon the prices realised being jnoreprofitable than at present time.   There has been an improvementin the  general  situation in Colombia but this has not extendedto the  piece goods trade, and, in consequence of the severecompetition between English Houses, orders are being booked at very cut prices.   Brazil appears to be settling down but,although Stocks are going into consumption, no material improvement in buying has taken plaoe since the revolution.
INDIA.     MR.  LINDSAY sent the following report     The  balance of trade figures for November 1930  are  reported as follows:-Imports of private merchandise..........

Nov. 1929 (lakhs of rupees).	1191 1728 36 44 461 4- 33	2250 2734 122 89 289 - 170Balance of Government transfers of funds		          Details of trade for the month of October 1930.     BnportSj,   As compared with October 1929 the value of food,drink and tobacco fell by Rs.30 lakhs to Rs.303 laKhs in October1930 owing mainly to decreases in the imports of sugar and tobacco.Raw materials and articles mainly unmanufactured decreased byRs.22 lakhs to Rs.152 laAchs owing chiefly to smaller imports ofprecious stones and mineral oils other than kerosene although there was an increase in the imports of kerosene oil.   -articleswholly or mainly manufactured amounting to Rs.793 lakhs showed adecrease of Rs.59l lakhs mainly as a- result of small imports ofmachinery, iron and steel, motor cars, hardware, paper and pasteboard, cotton yarn, cotton,silk and woollen manufactures and piecegoods of cotton and artificial silk.     Exports.   As compared with October 1929 the exports  of food,drink and tobacco in October 1930 decreased by Rs.121 lakhs toRs.525 lakhs owing mainly to decreases in the exports of rice andtea although there were increases in the exports of v/heat andcoffee.   Raw materials and produce decreased by Rs.455 lakhs toRs.687 lakhs owing to decrease in the  exports of oil seeds, rawwool, raw jute and raw skins.   Articles wholly or mainlymanufactured decreased by Rs.211 lakhs to Rs.537 lakhs owingchiefly to decreases in the exports of jute gunny bags and  cloth,cotton manufactures and tanned hides.     Trade in 7 Months April to October 1930.   During the seven months ended October 1930 the value of the imports decreased ascompared with the corresponding period of 1929 by Rs.40 crores or28$ and amounted to Rs.100 crores.    The exports of Indianmerchandise showed a decrease of Rs.42 crores or 23^ andre-exports also decreased by Rs.140 lakhs or 52%.   The grandtotal of imports, exports and re-expo-rts amounted to Rs.243 croresas against Rs.327 crores, a decrease of Rs.84 crores or 26$.     Weather and CropsDuring the month of December rainfallhas been seasonable &quot;in most parts of India, although certain tractslike the Punjab report a deficiency of rain.    Accordinglyoperations are in progress and rabi and other standing crops arein good condition and outturn prospects are on the whole promising.     Bank Rate .    The Bank Rate remains at present at 6 per cent.
NOTES ON NON-FERROUS METALS     CAPTAIN LYTTLETON sent the following report:-Copper.     Consuming interest has been quiet, owing to the christmas holidays and the stocktaking period,  and  there  is little improvement to record.Tin.     Demand on the whole has been fairly satisfactory.Tinplate manufacturers in Swansea have been working at  under50$ capacity, but an improvement is anticipated shortly.Lead.     Conditions in Birmingham are still quiet,  at about50% of normal:  the battery trade alone shows any activity.Consumers in Liverpool are reported to have considerable  stocks to liquidate, and an early revival can hardly be anticipated,though cable-makers have been more encouraging lateljr.Spelter.     There is little activity to report.   The Australian banon imports is a serious handicap, and Japanese competitionthreatens to secure the Eastern markets.   Galvanised wiremanufacturers experienced a further fallin -off, but expectsome recovery at the end of the month.                            STEEL.     Extract from a statement handed in by Mr.  Mitchell:-Steel.     The production for November was 63,500  tons  compared with81,700 tons for October and 145,900 tons for November  1989.     There has been much short time and the  Steel V/orks  are getting very small outputs.   The prospects  for next year are bad.Very few shipbuilding orders are being placed and there  is littleenquiry for export.     The imports of Steel into the district  continue heavyalthough somewhat less than for previous months.S c rap.                             ^     The imports into Scotland in November were 3,895  tons, andexoorts 721 tons.

MOTOR INDUSTRY0SIR WILLIAM MORRIS sent the following report:-   18 Home Trade conditions have not materially changed duringthe past month,   While, in the higher priced cars over  500,there are distinct signs of a slackening of demand, the totalsales of all motor cars is probably not less than during thecorresponding period of 1929.   2. In the commercial vehicle field, conditions are generallyslack, but this to some extent may be due to the uncertainty ofthe new public service vehicle regulations,,   In the smallertypes of trucks demand appears to be quite steady,   3. Export conditions become more difficult.   Australia is virtually out of the market, and there are fews if any, signs ofimprovement, though the demand for the smaller types of cars andtrucks is in excess of last year to most markets,   4, The beginning of the new year may be the opportunity to review shortly the conditions of 1930.     (a) Imports of complete cars and chassis have dropped by           75$a, and of parts and accessories by 25fa,   To some           extent, the increasing use of British components in           the Ford and Chevrolet chassis is responsible.         Further., the value of exports of motor products over           imports shews an increase of over  2,000,000           compared with 1989.     (b) Sales of all types of vehicles have been probably only           some 7% below those of 1929, from which it would           seem that 1930 home output has not differed materially           during the past year.     (c) Exports have been approximately maintained, with the           important exception of Australia, and the percentage           of registrations of British vehicles in all export           markets has been increased from &amp;fo to 10$.     (d) Employment has  -probably been somewhat less during the           period, and unemployment has varied from bfa to 15%.           Unemployment has tended to increase during the year,           and unless conditions improve and stocks can be           liquidated, further increases are inevitable.   5, As regards the future, it would be idle to minimise thedifficulties of the Motor Industry,   The United States remainsan unknown factor.     Never since the War have conditions been more difficult, norhas it been less easy to visualise prospects at home or abroad.     Of one thing may it be said with certainty - that if, foreven a limited period of ti^ie, it were possible to see the samemeasure of tariff help given to British Motor Vehicles in SouthAfrica and India, in particular, as has been given by NewZealand, output from our Factories would soon be increased by50%, and we could afford f.o.b.  prices for the Continent, SouthAmerica and elsewhere, which would very rapidly enable us to capture markets hitherto closed.
   6.-Translating the experiences of the past year, there is a growing appreciation of the value of the characteristic BritishMotor vehicle in many parts of the world..   Losses bydistributors of American vehicles have caused a reaction infavour of British products.   One thing remains viz:-  the realisation that the problems of Australia and other parts ofthe Empire are our problems, and that these can only be met inthe interests of employment at home by the conception of the mutual identity of interests by each part of the Empire.GENERAL TRADE.SIR WALTER RAINS sent the following report:-     Adverting to the remarks which I made a month ago,  on  the prospective position of  the Coal  trade  on the North-East coast,and of Durham in particular, what I then stated  is turning  out to be actually correct,  and there is no doubt that quite apartfrom the effect of the South Wales stoppage, certain Collieriesin DTzrham, particularly  those producing best qualities of Coals,will have little or no Coal for Export  this month.   Receiversabroad will, therefore,  have to be content with  second-classCoal.   This is very unfortunate, and there is little doubt that unless some alteration is made, those countries  which have  been accustomed to purchase best qualities of Coals,  will refuse toaccept second grades, and we may  find a great increase in thepurchase of American Gas Coals for the Bay and Mediterranean.     With regard to Shipbuilding, there is nothing further  toreport from the North-East coast, excepting that there are  afew enquiries circulating for Motor-snips.   One can only hopethat with the enormous increase in the unemployed, that  some ofthese enquiries may result in orders being placed.     Shiprepairing has been very  much quieter.   Generallyspeaking, there is nothing of an  encouraging nature to report with regard, to the immediate future.   Many people are hop ingthat the groat fall which has taken place in commodity prices,ifu-y result in creating a demand for the replacement of depletedstocks of various goods.   If and when  such takes place  to  any great ex/cent, there is no doubt that it will be  the initiation of a return of confidence again.ENGINEERING.Report handed in b  MR. ROJTLAND: -Review of J^he jcurreirt^ sjitna/tijon.     The calendar year 1930 has now completed its course, but asthe relevant returns for December are still lacking, we are notyet able to compile the coupleto statistical rocord for the year which has gone.   However, we have definite data for the elevenmonths ended November 30th (the statistics for November being as
usual recorded in summary form in our usual Abstract;  see Table1 appended), and these, it need hardly be said, are more  thansufficient to enable one to pass judgment upon the past year.This can be none other than that 1930 was one of the worst  -industrial and trading years in recent timesj  and certainly forthe engineering industry it was the worst year statisticallysince 1924,   In fact, foreign trade returns, employmentpercentages, and production indices alike, were, at  the end of1930, even lower than the general average of 1924,   And, on theother hand, when we consider the future prospects of theindustry, we are compelled to admit that never in post-war years has the outlook seemed more unpromising and unpredictable, andit must be said that the engineering industry, in common  with others, is largely at the mercy of political, financial,  andother factors and developments beyond its own control.     Of the detailed statistics for November little need  be addedby way of comment  to the summarized record given in Table 1,The further decline in production statistics, and the disappointingcharacter of the November trade returns as compared with  October,will be noticed.   There is also the inevitable further increasein unemployment in all industries (with the fortuitous-exception of coalmining).   The statistics further reflect the prevailing depression, in the reduced amount of bank clearingsand railway traffic receipts during the month.     As explained above, it is not yet possible to compile completestatistics for 1930, but in order that some indication of theyear 5s performance may be available, now that we have enteredinto the New Year, we have compiled a summary (Table 2 appended)of the foreign trade in the principal categories of machinery and vehicles, analysing the export side in some detail both oftonnage and value.   It will be seen that exports of machineryfor the eleven months of this year have totalled 446,720  tons,  adecline of fully 72,000 tons as compared with 518,776 tonsexported in the corresponding period of 1929,   Total exporttonnage for 1930, when the December figures come to be added,will almost certainly not reach the 500,000 tons mark.    Theprincipal declines in exports occur in the cases of prime movers,textile machinery, sewing machines, and in the miscellaneousgroup.   There are, however, increases to be recorded in boilersand boiler-house plant, electrical machinery, and cranes  andlifting machinery.   The average value per ton of the exports,it should be noted, has increased slightly from  96.3 in  1929 to 97,6 in 1930, so that the total declared value of exports in1930, as compared with 1989, shows a slightly less proportionatedecrease than is revealed by a comparison of tonnage figures.     The exports of complete locomotives have shown a gratifyingincrease in both tonnage and value over 1929, but this is offset by a big crop in the value of locomotive parts exported.   Therehas also been a partial decline in the export of motor vehicles,but, on the other hand, a big increase in the value of new shipsexported for foreign ownership;  and it is interesting to note that the increase is entirely attributable to the class of motorvessels, of which the export value was  8.7 millions in -1.930, ascompared with  2.3 millions in 1929,     It will be seen from Table 8 that the gross imports  ofmachinery were somewhat reduced in 1930 as compared with  1929, butthat the re-exports were slightly greater in tonnage, althoughless in declared value.   The retained (or net) imports ofmachinery fell short of the corresponding amount in 1929 by fully6,000 tons (92,037 tons as against 98,199 tons), the aggregatevalue being approximately  15 millions as compared with  16millions, and the average value per ton approximately identical, 163.1 and  163.2 respectively, ,
Dijfauftution of Engineering Unemployment.     In view of the very large and serious increase of uneinploy-rnent during 1S30 in the engineering Industry, as in all others,we present in Table 3 (appended) a direct comparison of theunemployment position in the principal engineering trades as atNovember 1930 compared with the corresponding month in 1929,anal3rsing the returns    the principal districts for each branchof the industry-   These data are abstracted and adapted from the&quot;Ministry of Labour Gazette&quot; returns,,   The table may be left topoint its ora lessons, but it may said here, that as one might expect, the incidence of current unemployment is heaviest in theNorth-Eastern and North-Western regions, and in Scotland,   Thegeneral unemployment index for all the trades surveyed in this table has increased in the twelve months from 9,0$ to 20,1$, thegeneral engineering branch having increased from 10,2$ to 22,3%,electrical engineering from 4,2$ to 11,4$, marine engineeringfrom 9,8$ to 27,9$, constructional engineering from 12,0$ to2302$, and motors, etc, from 7,3$ to 1509$,   It will be noticed that the marine engineering section shows the greatest percentage increase of unemployment during the year, and a glance at the regional analysis for the section shows how terribly hard-hithave been the workers on the North-East Coast and in Scotland,whereas unemployiaent aacngst marine engineers in Northern ireland has not been so aggravated as in those two cases.   Looking atthe other branches, we find that unemployment in general engineering in the North-Western area now stands as high as 3303$,or one in every three workers unemployed.   The substantial increase and &quot;existing extent of unemplos^ient in the electrical engineering and automobile trades is very significant, inasmuch as these sections were formerly those returning the lowestunemployment percentages.Engineering contracts.

RAILWAYS.     SIR RALPH WEDGWOOD sent the following reports-     Sinoe  the last report the reduction in Total Railway-Traffic Receipts for the Pour Group Companies was 5f$.  this compares with a decrease in the previous four-weekly periodof 7%*  Receipts from Coal and Coke traffic were only    lessthan in 1929, due no doubt to the movement of landsale coalowing to the cold weather.  The L.M.S.R. showed an increaseof 3% during the four weeks under review and the S.R. anincrease of 5%.  Receipts from Shipment Coal on the L.N,E,R,fell by 6%% compared with the same period in 1929,  Therewere decreases in receipts from Passenger and MerchandiseTraffic of 5% and 10f$ respectively.  It will be noted fromthe attached statement that for the 52 weeks ended 27thDecember, 1930, receipts from Total Railway traffics for thePour Group Companies were 5f:^ less than in 1929, thelargest decrease i7^fo) &quot;being recorded in Merchandise which includes general goods and mineral except coal and coke.Coal and coke receipts fell by 5f?f and passenger receiptsby 4%fo although it should be remembered that 1929 was not agood year for Passenger Traffic Receipts.     It cannot be said that the prospects for 1S?1 are atall bright.  The stoppages in the  Coal and Cotton-indxistriesand the increasing unemployment figures will naturallyaffect the railway receipts, and there are no signs  of thetrade depression lifting in any of the other greatindustries on which the railways rely for their traffic.54-

1 Q&apos;.&apos;i5                           HOSIERY.     MR. WALKER sent the following report:-     Nottingham,  This period of the year is usually one ofthe quietest and the present has proved to he no exception.In the Retail Trade the January Sales predominate, whilstmany wholesalers and manufacturers are engaged in stock-taking.     It is, however, now generally felt that prices havetouched bottom, and it is hoped that results will shew improvedconditions, in the course of the next week or two.     As regards the Export trade, business is uncertain,financial difficulties in several of the importing countriesdominating the situation.     Ilinckley.  In this district, there is very little toreport.   Any slight improvement there may have been towardsthe end of last year has ceased, and trade generally is flat.Unemployment is greater.     The reductions in prices unfortunately do not help atthis time, until general stock-takings are finished.     Leicester,  The demand for fancy outerwear has been better with some manufacturers than normally in December,possibly owing to the fact that the season started lafce andthat merchants hold such small stocks.     The Women&apos;s Underwear Trade is about normal for the timeof the year,and there is not enough business in these departments to keep machinery going on full time.   prospects for January largely depend on seasonable weather.     Although the trade generally is not fully occupied, itis estimated that approximately 95% of full capacity wasworked during the busiest period before Christmas.     Loughborough.  Trade is worse than a month ago, and worse than this time last year.   Short time is being worked inevery section of the trade.     The continued fall in raw material prices has createdan utter lack of confidence, and the ever increasing volumeof foreign made goods which is flooding our markets in allstyles and makes, together with the increased Canadian Tariff,has made 1930 the worst year experienced f or t.ie last thirty years.     Hawick.   The slight seasonal improvement during october and November has worked itself off and business isharder to get than ever.   Little improvement can now be looked for until the Spring, although if the present spell ofcold weather continues, there may be a temporary slightimprovement.     The Home market is flooded with cheap foreign cut goods,both Underwear and Outerwear, at prices much below those withwhich  the Hawick Cottons Patent trade can compete, and price is certainly  a  vital factor now, both in Home and export markets.

WAIiiSLEY;-     A report from Scotland states that at the end of 1930production was as low as has ever been experienced in the steel trade, melting furnaces having in many cases ceased opera-1 ionsfor a considerable period pirior to the customary time.   Thereare as yet no signs of any improvement and order books areslow to fill up during the stoppage and many mills will be forced to remain idle longer than usual at this period.   Lackof new orders is still largely the rule in the Clyde Ship-building Yards, and Structural Works are finding it a verydifficult matter to obtain more than the minimum necessary toenable them to carry on.   Some few foreign contracts have beenplaced with engineering and locomotive building establishments and with wagon and rolling stock manufacturers in the Glasgow-area, which, while welcome as evidence of ability to obtain thebusiness against world competition, does not materially help the Steel industry in Scotland to increase production even if all the supplies were drawn from the Steel Works in theneighbourhood.
