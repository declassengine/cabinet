THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT. 9 K 9                 Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1931.                                                                           1*&apos;*&apos;SECRET.                                                     Copy No.    ^CP. 32 (31).                                 CABINET.THE SITUATION  IN  MALTA.         MEMORANDUM  BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE  COLONIES.    I CIRCULATE, with  reference to CP. 5 (31), the annexed  paraphrases  of telegrams exchanged between me and the Governor of Malta.    I entirely agree with Sir John Du Cane that the action of Ministers which isreported in his telegram makes impossible their continued retention in Office.  apart altogether from the question of the appointment of a Royal Commission and of ourrelations  with the Vatican, the dismissal of Ministers appears to me to have become essential from the standpoint of Constitutional propriety.  They obviously cannot beallowed to remain in office as the Governors advisers and at the same time deliverattacks on him  in the Press.   I  strongly recommend, therefore, that whatever decision may be come to with regard to the appointment of a Royal Commission, theGovernor should be  authorised to dismiss the Ministers without further delay.    I  annex,  for  convenience of  reference, an  extract from the ConfidentialMemorandum by Lord Howard of Penrith to which Sir John Du Cane refers in thelast part  of his telegram.                                                                          P.    Colonial  Office, February 2, 1931.Paraphrase Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to  the Governor                                  of Malta.                       (Sent 10 P.M.  30th  january.  1931.)    No. 11, Secret.    Reference my telegram No. 7.  The following is for  your secret information.The Malta question was discussed by  the Cabinet on 28th &quot;January, but was againpostponed to their next  meeting for further consideration.    I am doing all that is possible to  expedite a decision, as I fully realise  the inconvenience which  these delays must be causing you.   Paraphrase Telegram from the Governor of Malta to the Secretary of State                               for the Colonies.                          Dated 31st January, 1931.                        (Received 31st January, 1931.)    No. 11, Urgent.    I have received your telegram, No. II, Secret.    While I  appreciate  fully  that very  careful  consideration  by Cabinet  isnecessitated by the complicated nature of the question, yet at the same time, owingto  the action of  Strickland and Ministers, the situation is becoming increasingly difficult.  Since he returned to Malta, Strickland (as I have already reported to you)has not made any attempt to work harmoniously the /present system of Government.He has  of late been definitely hostile, and  the policy of the  Government is nowAdversely criticised  in the newspaper which he controls.  He intimated to me late      [5014]
2last night that it had been decided by Ministers in Cabinet to publish in the press a communication about the traffic control board which was recently addressed to the lieutenant-Governor, and the document appeared in the press  this morning.  It isnot only critical of  Government  policy,  but attributes  to Government  impropermotives for  their action.  It was, I submit, a flagrant breach  of propriety to givepublicity to this document  without my leave;  and this action necessarily makesMinisters unsuitable to be retained even in an advisory capacity.  Ministers cannot have the best  of both worlds; they cannot, that is, draw salaries and  attack theGovernment at the same time.  The present system of  Government, which answeredits purpose well enough for some months, has, in fact, broken down, and it should bebrought to an end without  delay.  The reasons for the delay  in dealing with thismatter in the Cabinet are, of  course, unknown to me;  but if one of the obstacles isthe question of retaining Ministers, the solution might perhaps be made  easier ifthey can be dismissed for failure to work, smoothly and without friction, the present regime.  I desire  in any case to impress upon  you that I  am now saddled with ministers who are doing all they can to obstruct the Government and in whom I haveno confidence.  The motives of Strickland are obscure, and his mind too tortuous;but my opinion is that  the possibility of an election  at no distant  date  has beenscented by him, and his present action is  the  move  with which his campaign isbeing opened.     I would, in conclusion,  invite your attention to the fourth  suggestion containedin the Memorandum on the Maltese question by Lord  Howard.  I disagree with many of the views and  statements which this memorandum contains, but still, ifthere is difficulty in  giving effect to the policy of sending a Royal Commission to malta, there may possibly be some value in this particular suggestion, provided thatit is understood that, since there are no eider non-party statesmen available from whom a Ministry could be formed, a &quot; Gouvernement d&apos;Affaires &quot; in Malta would necessarily have to be composed of  the Governor and Heads of Departments.ANNEXURE.   ExtractJrom  Confidential &quot;Memorandum regarding  the Malta Crisis&quot; by                Lord Howard of Penrith, dated January 6, 1931.         *****           *    Let us therefore consider the possible solutions :     1st.  That which would commend itself to Mr. Isaac Eoot and his partizans, anidoubtless to many other most worthy Englishmen who have no understanding ofwhat  we may call Mediterranean mentality, is to ride  roughshod over the Bishopsand that part of the Maltese electorate which stands by them.  That part is,  in anycase, half, and is probably, considering the strong Catholic feeling in Malta vouchedfor repeatedly by Lord  Strickland and Sir A. Bartolo,  a  good deal more than half.The above solution is presumably what Mr. Isaac Foot had in mind when he suggestedin his House of Commons speech of the 26th June, 1930, that there should be applied in Malta that Article of the Corrupt Practices Act which threatens with  twelvemonths&apos;  imprisonment  or a  fine of   200  &quot;any  person who directly  or  indirectlyinflicts or threatens to inflict any spiritual injury upon any person in order ro induceor compel such person to vote or to refrain from voting.&quot;    Mr. Foot asks why that Act is not applicable  to the  Archbishop cf Malta andthe Bishop of Gozo, and replies that it is not so now  because they are  not amenable to the law and, being above the law, they have denied the rights rf the law to  others.But Mr. Foot must know that this is not the case, and that  the reason  why it is notapplicable  to Bishops or to  anyone else in Malta is because, though it  is the  law ofGreat Britain, it is not the laAV of Malta.  Before, therefore, it can be applied tothe Bishops in question it must become a law in Malta, and how does anyone proposeto do that  now and before new elections take place except  by an Order in council which would  be  a direct violation of the constitutional  rights of Malta ?   It  isneedless to point  out the reactions that such a measure would be likely  to produce in malta.  It is enough to say that it would probably have the effect of creating so strong
a feeling against a measure thus imposed by force that the establishment of realfreedom of elections would be postponed for many a long day.    It would be difficult to imagine anything more disastrous for the very objectsthat Mr. Foot (I refer to him constantly as a type or representative of a certain kindof mentality in England)  wishes to attain in Malta.  If the views and methods ofthe Bishops may be thought by some to be mediaeval, the policy of the Foots smacks too much of the time of Cromwell and too little of respect for public opinion.    2nd. The second  solution is, indeed, no solution.    It is to continue governing indefinitely as at present with the  Constitution insuspense, the elections indefinitely postponed, and Lord Strickland and his Ministryretained indefinitely &quot;in  an advisory  capacity,&quot; meaning much or  little accordingto the will of the Governor for the time being.    That state  of things can hardly continue for many months more, and some more permanent arrangement must be come  to.    3rd. The Governor may now declare that the danger of serious disturbances atthe elections having ceased, there is no further need that they should be postponed,and he may  allow them to take place whether the Bishops renew their Pastoral forthe new elections or not.   Unless I am mistaken, the Pastoral which was issued forthe elections last year would have to be specifically and explicitly renewed in orderto be effective in the event of new elections being held this year.   Here we  might possibly find a  way out.   This  is at least an avenue which might be explored with advantage.  What precisely Lord Strickland should  do to  mollify the resentmentfelt by the Bishops would have to be the subject of informal pourparlers with the vatican and the Bishops.  One thing,  however, may safely be said, that a merepromise by Lord Strickland not to  attack the clergy or to allow the Press to  do soduring the elections in return for a general promise by the Bishops that the  clergywould never again take part in politics,  which is apparently what Lord Stricklandwas prepared to offer before, would be considered quite inadequate and unacceptable.    It would indeed  be worse,  for any vague, indefinite verbal arrangement of thiskind would be  certain to lead  to accusations on both  sides of breach of  faith andendless  recrimination.  Any arrangement for curtailing the action of either  partyduring elections, to be satisfactory, must be based on a definite  written agreement.This is  obviously a conditio sine qua non.  It may, however, be possible to come tosome temporary modus vivendi pending a regular concordat with the Vatican whichwill allow the  elections to be  held  without pressure on the one side or  irritatingattack on the other.  This solution seems to offer the best hope of success.    4th. There is also a fourth solution, which, however, would be fought tooth andnail by Lord Strickland and his partizans because it could not be carried out without loss of face for them, and this would be for the Governor to declare that, in view ofthe fact that free elections cannot be held so long as the Bishops&apos; Pastoral remains in esse, the Constitution  must  be suspended until a definite arrangement  regarding the attitude of the clergy during elections can be arrived at, and that in view of the suspension of the Constitution there can no longer be any constitutional Government, but only a  Gouvernement d&apos;affaires,  which implies the removal of the Strickland Ministry from  office even  as an advisory Government.  In this case it would no doubt be possible  to begin negotiations at once with  the Vatican for  a concordat,  and  it might be  possible, if these were not unduly protracted, to hold new elections  in the course  of  this  year  at which the real strength of  the  contending  parties would be tested.     Personally, I can see no other way of escape than by one or other of the above solutions from a situation which threatens to become very serious for the following- reasons  if  left too  long unsettled,  or  if  settled unsatisfactorily  for  the  great majority of Maltese.          ******
