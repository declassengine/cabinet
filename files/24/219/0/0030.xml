THB  FINANCE OP UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE, 1911-1930.  1. The following paragraphs furnish a brief reviewof the history of the finance of Unemployment Insur-ance.  A  fuller account of tlhe subject is given inAppendix I, which states in some detail the salientfacts of each year  (Live Register, Legislation,  etc.)in relation  to the  course  of finance.  The  a-ates of contribution and benefit provided by the successiveActs and some of the  principal conditions are tabu-lated in Appendix II and a summary of the receipts and payments of the  Unemployment Fund as pre-sented  to  Parliament year by  year  is given  inAppendix III. These  three appendices, which enterinto  considerable detail,  are  submitted both  for reference  and to  facilitate  examination of particular points.1911-1920.  2. Tho Act of 1911 provided that the rate of con-tribution  should  be 5d. per week,  divided equally between employer and employed, plus 1-jd. from the Exchequer, that the rate of benefit should be 7s. per&quot;&quot;week for adults, that benefit should be related  to contributions in a special way, viz., that not  more than one weok&apos;s benefit should be drawn in respect of each five contributions paid and that not more  than 15 weeks&apos; benefit could be drawn in 12 months.  The Act  was intended to provide  benefit for short spells of unemployment between  jobs, the trades  covered being particularly  susceptible to this kind of unem- ployment.  3.  The scheme, which was avowedly an experiment, was  framed on  careful lines in regard to finance and it had the advantage  of  having been launched when employment was good.  Tho income for the first full year during which benefit was payable (ended  July, 1914)  was about   2,460,000  and  the  expenditure  895,000, of which  530,000 was  paid  in  benefit. It will be seen  that the Fund could have paid three
 to four times  as much benefit  as it did; the rate  of unemployment during this year in the trades covered was about 3.8 per cent.   4.  In 1916  the scheme was  extended  temporarily to cover 1J million  more workpeople.   The average annual payments of  benefit  for the years, 1916, 1917 and  1918 fell to less than  70,000, owing to the -war.  The result was that a large  surplus was  accu- mulated  and  by July, 1919, the Fund had a balance in hand  of over  18,000,000.   5.  The first brunt of  the  unemployment caused by the  change over  from  war to peace production was borne by the Exchequer through the  provision of Out  of Work Donation,  and the Unemployment Fund was considerably  relieved accordingly; so that during the year ended July,  1920, while the Fund receipts were  about  4,865,000 the  payments  were only   1,610,000.  Excluding administration, the Out of Work Donation scheme cost the Exchequer about  62,500,000, of which approximately   22,000,000 was in respect  of civilian  workers  for  the  period  to November,  1919. 1920-19U-   6. The contributory scheme  of  unemployment  in- surance was largely extended by the Act which  came into  force on  8th  November, 1920, and at  the end of 1920 the Unemployment  Fund  had  a reserve  of -over   22,500,000.   7. The Act  of  1920  covered   about  11,500,000 workers.  The rates  of benefit were  raised to  15s. and 12s.  for men and women  respectively,  and the contributions were also  increased,  the  total weekly rate  in  the  case of  men being lOd. employer  4d., employed 4d.,  Exchequer 2d.  The principle of the 1911  Act  as   to  limiting  the duration of benefit according to the  number of contributions paid  was retained, though the limit  was altered  slightly  and became one week&apos;s benefit for six contributions with&apos; a  maximum of  15  weeks&apos;  benefit  in an insurance year.  The 1920  Act and the  Temporary Provisions Amendment  Act  passed  in  December,  1920,  made special provision for  new entrants  into  insurance.   8. -Shortly  after  the commencement of the opera- tion  of  the  1920 Act a  great depression  in  trade began to reveal itself and the  Coal Dispute of 1921 followed.   Because of the  increased  unemployment and because the donation scheme would  no longer be available  for ex-service men  after  31st March, 1921, it  was  decided early  in  1921 to make  further pro- vision put of the Unemployment Fund for those per- sons who  had exhausted the benefits provided by the 1920 Act.   9. The  two  Acts  of 1921  increased the  i-ates of benefit  to 20s. in the  ease  of  men fc)r  a period of about three months,  increased the  maximum numberof weeks for which benefit could be drawn in a year and  provided  for  additional  benefit  (i.e.,  &quot; un-covenanted &quot;  benefit  or benefit in excess of that towhich  insured persons  were entitled by virtue of contributions)  during two  &quot; special periods,&quot;1 the ex- tensions during these periods under the  later of thetwo Acts being at the discretion of the Minister.   To meet  these concessions, contributions were raised in the case of  men to Is. 6fd., to which a further 7d. was added for Dependants&apos;  Benefit by  a third  Act passed   later   in   1921.    The  approximate  re- ceipts and  payments during the  12  months ended March, 1922,  were  36i millions and  71J  millions respectively with an average live register  of  about 1,940,000.  As the contributions levied  to  pay for dependants&apos;  benefit  in  November,  1921,  had  been adequate to pay for that benefit, the ordinary finance of the scheme was  obviously  quite inadequate  to cover the benefits with such  a live  register.  * In  this emergency legislation the term &quot; specialperiod &quot;  was  given  to certain stated  periods  of weeks  within  which  a  claimant  could draw  notmore  than a specified number of weeks of benefit.  10. Owing to the degree of unemployment prevailsing  many  claimants  would  have  exhausted their .special periods by the earliest possible date, namely,April, 1922.  As  the live register  was  then still very high (over 1,700,000) with no  prospect  of con-siderable  reduction  in  the  near   future,  it wasdecided  to  enact  further  special  periods*  duringwhich benefit  should be paid.  11. In  1923  the grant  of uncovonanted benefit was further  extended  but  the  live  register   fell  to1,300,000 by March, 1923, and by the end of March,1924, it had fallen below 1,100,000.  12. The  Act  of  1911  had  provided  borrowing powers  of    3,000,000,  i.e.,  more  than  a  year&apos;income.   When   the  1920  Act  was  under  con-sideration the Fund had  in hand a surplus which was rapidly approaching a  year&apos;s  income  on the new basis.  It was therefore  not considered  necessary tomake provision  for  borrowing in  that Act.  the drain on the  Fund,  however, had  exhausted thereserve by the beginning of July, 1921,  and borrow-ing powers were  taken as follows :  Amoimt of&quot;Borrowing  Powers granted.     10,000,00010,000,00010,000,000 Making a  total of. Borrowing Powers of      10,000,000 20,000,000 30,000,000Act   of   1921,   passed  3rd  March,  1921  ...No.   2  Act  of  1921,  passed 1st July, 1921Act   of   1922,   passed  12th April,  1922  13.  Recourse was had to borrowing  because  it was always  considered  that  the  heavy  unemployment,though not likely  to fall appreciably  in  the nearfuture, could  not be of long  duration.   On each ofthese  occasions the Act provided for additional con-tribution  revenue the. increase in  1922,  however,being  no more than the aggregation  of  the con-tributions  for  ordinary  benefit  and  dependants&apos;benefit.  14.  The debt rose steadily  to  about   16,750,000( 17,060,000 including Ireland)  in  March, 1923,  andthen  fell gradually  to   12,500,000  at the  end ofDecember,  1923,  and  rapidly  to  below  4,500,000by August, 1924.  On the average over  a  year  and allowing for the steady growth in income as the num-ber of  insured  persons increased,  the Fund couldby  1924 finance  a  live  register  of  a little over1,400,000, i.e., income and expenditure would balancewith a register of this figure.1924-29.  15.  The average live register in 1924 was about1,130,000 which  was  considerably lower  than in  any year   since  the   extension   of  the   scheme  in1920,   and  the  debt was   falling.    The   Unem-ployment Insurance  (No.  2)  Act   of   1924   in-creased rates of benefit, reduced the  waiting  period to three days  and  granted  extended benefit as aright  whereas previously  it was a  matter of discre-tion.   It also  provided for the abolition of refundsof contributions at age 60f with compensation  in cer-tain cases.  As no  extra income  wa6  provided tomeet the cost of these changes, the balancing pointof the fund as regards current expenditure was  re-duced  from 1,440,000 to  1,200,000,  with  a weekly-contribution of 25J pence (men).  The Live  Registerrose  above the  new  balancing  point  in September,1924, when the debt was about  4,400,000, and it wasnecessary again to start  to bonrow regularly.  * See footnote (*) on previous column.  t The Act  of  1920, following  the Act  of  1911,  had made provision for refunding to an insured contribu-tor at age  60  the excess,  if any, of his own part oftho contributions paid in respect  of him over theamount  of benefit drawn, with interest at 2-i  percent.   It was  this provision which  was repealed  by the No.  2 Act of 1924.
  16. The course of events since 1924 has been breifly as  follows:  The   contribution   revenue  of  theFund  was   reduced   by  two  stages,;   first   in1925 by 4d.  per week in the case of men  (employers2d.,  employed 2d.) to assist in floating the  Contri-butory Pension Scheme and, second, by another Jd.(off the Exchequer contribution) by the Economy act of 1926. t  The total contribution revenue (men) was thus reduced from 25f pence to 21d. per week.  after allowing  for the curtailments of benefits, which  wereenacted  at  the same  time,  and . also  by the act of 1927,  the  revenue  was  only  sufficient to  cover the  expenditure while the Live Register  did notexceed 1,000,000.  If contributions  and benefits had remained as they  were at the end of 1924, the debt of the Fund at 1st  June, 1929, notwithstanding theheavy  drain on  the Fund caused  by  the  general strike and Coal  Dispute,  would have been  about 21,500,000;   instead,   the   actual   figure   was 36,870,000.  Thus  the net effect of the  changes  in contributions  and benefit made  by the  Acts of 1925and 1926 was  15,370,000  up to 1st June, 1929.1929-30.  17.  In June,  1929,  the income  of  the  Fund was sufficient to balance a  register of 1,000,000 whereas the Live  Register was  1,132,281  (27th  May)  andthe debt (1st June)  36,870,000.  The debt was  thusincreasing and further  financial provision was neces-sary at once.  IS.  The  first  step  taken  was  to   increase   theordinary Exchequer contribution to the Fund by theUnemployment Insurance Act,  1929, passed on  26thJuly.    This  increased  the Exchequer contribution from  38.6  per  cent,  of the  joint  contribution  ofemployers and employed to 50 per cent., an increaseof about  3,500,000  per annum,  and  it raised thebalancing point to 1,090,000.  19.  The next  step  was the Unemployment Insur-ance Act, 1930 (passed on 6th February, 1930), whichextended the  &quot; Transitional Period &quot;* by 12 months and -provided that the Exchequer should make  an extra  contribution to the Unemployment Fund equalto  the  cost  of  all  transitional  benefit  paid  toclaimants who commenced  a new benefit year  after31st March, 1929.  The effect of this was to relieve the ordinary  revenue  of the  Fund of  about  halfthe cost of transitional  benefit  in 1929-30  (viz.,  by 3,985,000); and in  1930-31 of the whole  cost, which  f The  Economy Act not only  reduced the rate of exchequer  contribution from  6Jd. (at which it stoodbefore  the  Act of 1925) to 6d.;  it  also  repealed  anadditional  contribution of 2Jd. per week, which theAct of  1925 provided that the Exchequer should pay.This 2Jd. had been granted in partial compensationfor the reduction of 4d. per week in the contribution of employers and employed  made by the  same  Actand referred to above.  The total effect of the  Economy Act on  the fund was thus to reduce its income by 3d.  per week until january, 1928.   After that date,  owing  to an  adjust-ment  in  respect  of persons over  the  age of 65,  theloss was 2d. per week.  The  amounts  of these  losses in revenue, allowing for interest, were as follows :                                            1926-71927-81928-9Total  5,100,000  5,900,000  4,650,000 15,650,000In 1929-30 the  Exchequer  contribution  was  raisedagain by the legislation of that year.  * Transitional  Period  and  Transitional  Benefithave been explained in paras. 27 and 34 of Memo,  ofEvidence No. 1.   73(525is now estimated to amount to  22,000,000 for  thatyear.  20.  The financial effect of the Act of  1930, apartfrom  extending the Transitional Period  and placing the cost of Transitional  Benefit  on  the Exchequer,was briefly  as  follows: -  21.  It increased certain rates  of  benefit  (youngmen and women and adult dependants); it repealedthe genuinely-seeking-work condition and the transi-tional condition as to reasonable  period of employ-ment in the last two years; it recast the  machineryfor the  decision of claims so as  to  secure  that  noone  except  a Court of Referees or  the  Umpire canreject a claim  to  benefit.  22. The  effect  of these  changes,  so  far  as  theycan  be ascertained at present, is  as follows,  with.a live register of  about 2,300,000:  Number ofAmountIncreased Rates of Benefit ...Benefit  paid  to persons  on &apos;the  register   who  would  previously  have  been  dis-  allowedBenefit    paid   to   married.  women  and   others added  to the Registerclaimants.   per annum.                                 4,250,000110,00070,0005,500,0003,250,000180,000     13,000,000  23.  These totals comprise both  persons  entitled to ordinary benefit  and to transitional  benefit, mainly the latter.Balancing  Points, past and present.  24.  By  &quot; balancing  point &quot;  is  meant the numberof persons on the Live  Register for whom benefit(and  cost  of  administration, etc.)  can be  providedout of a given contribution revenue without additionto or reduction of debt.  25.  The  following table shows the stages by  whichthe &quot; balancing point &quot; was reduced, and  has been raised again :   Number on  the Live Register atwhich income and expendi-ture balanced.Total weekly   rate of contribution   (Men).Before the No. 2 Act, 1924After the No. 2 Act, 1924...After Economy Act, 1926...After Act of 1927 ......After U.I.

The  present  balancing point which is stated above  at  &quot;about 1,275,000 &quot;  assumes that the  Ex-chequer continues  to  pay for  Transitional  Benefit.It is made up of two parts:        (a)  the number  of persons  claiming  benefit    who have not  paid 30  contributions.  The  cost    of this- Benefit,  which is Transitional Benefit, is    covered by a special  grant from the Exchequer;     and      (&amp;)  the number of other persons on the Live    register at the time  when the  amount  payable                                            A 2
    in ordinary benefit, together with the other final    charges  on the Fund, is equal to the whole of    the contribution  income.  27. As to  (a), it is not  possible to say how  manyinsured persons  over  18 years of age would fail tosatisfy  the 30 contribution rule and be entitled to benefit  under the present Acts with  a Live Register;as low as 1,275,000; but for the next year or two thobeet  figure which can  be given  is  probably  about275,000, including many who have  failed to satisfy the  transitional  conditions   and  are  yet  on  theRegister.  28. As  to  (6), the  ordinary revenue of the  Fundwith a Live  Register of  about this size would pro-vide  ordinary   benefit   for   approximately  900,000claimants.  In addition, there would be certain non-insured persons and others on the Register making atotal of about 1,000,000.Unemployment  Benefit:  distribution  as  between    groups of industries.  29.  Questions are sometimes asked  regarding  theindustries  in  which  workpeople  draw more in Un-employment Benefit than is represented by the con-tributions off the industry and which industries drawless.  For  a  variety  of  reasons it is  not possible togive  an entirely  satisfactory  answer  to  such ques-tions,  but the table in Appendix V  represents  an effort to furnish answers.   It  needs to be read sub-ject to various  qualifications, which  are noted  onthe page preceding the  Table.TAve  Register and Increase of Debt.  30.

Qrowth of the Charge oil the Exchequer.  32.  The proportion which the Exchequer has coti-tributed to the  revenue of the Unemployment Fundhas been varied  considerably by legislation from timeto time.  The  amount contributed and  actual pro-portion  in  each  year  is  shown  by  the  followingtable: -__________                                   Percentage of the                        Amount of    income of the      Year ended      I  Exchequer i  Fund, including                       contribution.;   the Exchequer                                     contribution.July, 1921    ......July, 1922    ......July, 1923    ......July, 1924    ......July, 1925    ......July. 1926    ......March, 1927  ......March, 1928  ......March, 1929  ......March, 1930  ......March, 1931 (estimated)        2,168 639 11,057,901s, 12,166.266 13,184,784 13,148,085 12,910,861  7,954,599-fi 12,024,910 11,757,831; 15,426,3861  3,985,000&apos; 14,970,000 22,000.00016-126-126-126-326-227-627-927-827-833-333-3  * Covers a period of five quarters.

Thefinancial year of the Fund, which had hitherto  coincided with the insurance year which ended in July, was  from now onwards changed to the  ordinary  financial year ending the 31st March.  33.  The  Exchequer  contribution   in  1929-30  and1930-31 was made up of  two parts :  1929-30.     1930-31.(estimated).

It will be seen that the recent increase in thecharge  on the  Exchequer  has been  so  large  as tomake  the charge  a  serious  element  in  NationalFinance.PART II. THE  PRESENT  FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS.The  Unemployment Fund,  35.  The Unemployment  Insurance Acts establishedan  Unemployment  Fund  under   the   control  and management of the Minister of Labour  to which allthe contributions  payable by  employers, employed persons and the Exchequer are credited; and out ofwhich Unemployment Benefit including transitional benefit and the cost of its administration,  interest on  advances  made by  the  Treasury,   and  certain minor  payments   are  made.  An   account  of  thereceipts  and pa3&apos;ments of the Fund  is  presented toParliament  annually, after  being  audited  by  the comptroller and Auditor-General.  The account, withhis report on it, is  considered by the Public accounts committee.  36.  The Act of  1930,  as already stated,  providedthat the Exchequer should make an  extra contribu-tion to the Unemployment Fund equal to the cost ofall transitional benefit paid  to  claimants who  cpm-menced a new  benefit year after 31st March. 1929.  37.  This change  has in effect  divided  the  Unem-ployment Fund into two separate parts:        (a) ordinary  benefit, which, with the  interest    on  the debt and the cost of administration of    such benefit,  is defrayed out of the contributions    of employers and employed and the contribution    on the  &quot; equal-thirds  &quot; basis by the  Exchequer.    These revenues are in no  way applied to      (6) transitional benefit,  which,  with the  cost    of its administration, is  financed wholly by  a    special  equivalent grant made to the Unemploy-    ment Fund from the Exchequer.Estimated &quot;Receipts and Payments of the Fund.  38.  The following account is an estimate in  6um-marised  form of the  receipts  and  payments  of theUnemployment Fund  for  a full year at the rate ofexpenditure which  was being  incurred in December,1930,   when  the  Live   Register  averaged   about.300.000Unemployment Fund Accounz.

  39.  The income  from contributions depends on thenumber of persons in work, so that it falls somewhatas the Live  Register  rises.   The decrease is about 350,000 per annum for each 100,000 rise in the live register and vice versa.  As the total contribution income  is  about   44,400,000 and  the  total  weekly contribution  for  a man is 22Ad.  (see  para.  46),  it follows that  Id. contribution for  a  man, with appro-priate contributions for other classes, produces about 2,000,000 per annum.  40.  The total amount of  99,250,000  shown in theabove  account as the  approximate annual expendi-ture  on benefit with a Live Register of  2,300,000can be  divided up,  approximately, as follows:                                                Benefit  paid at  adult rates     ......   72,250,000Benefit  paid  in respect of dependants:    (a)  adult  dependants   .........   15,250,000  (b)  dependent children.........    5,500,000Benefit  paid  to young persons (18 to 21)    5,500,000Juveniles     ...............      750,000 99,250,000  41.  The average  amount of  benefit paid per weekper  head  is  substantially  higher  in  the  case  of transitional   Benefit   than   Ordinary  Benefit  asfollows :                                         Per person,                                         paid.                                           s.  d.    Ordinary  Benefit  ...    ...    ...      17  4    Transitional  Benefit    ...    ...    114The  cost per  person  paid is  higher  in  the caseof Transitional Benefit because men drawing it have on the average rather more dependants, and because there are fewer women among transitional claimantsand  no juveniles.   They are also probably rather lessaffected  by  the waiting period, because their spellsof unemployment&apos;ment are longer.Division of the Live Register as  between claimants    to Ordinary  Benefit and Transitional  Benefit,  42. The Live Register is made  up of four  parts,viz.,  claimants to ordinary  benefit,  claimants  totransitional  benefit  and   two  other  classes.   the exact  division   of the.  Live  Register  of  about,300,000 assumed  in  the  above  table  is not  atpresent   available,  but   it  is  approximately  asfollows :  Claimants to  Ordinary Benefit   ......   1,775,000Claimants to  Transitional  Benefit......    375,000Transitional  non-claimants*      ...    ...     50,000Uninsured persons on the Register and  insured juvenile  non-claimants ...    ...    100,0002,300,000This method of dividing the Live Register is used in later sections of this memorandum in considering thefinance of the two kinds of benefit.Vrcscnt  Bates of Contribution  and  Benefit.  43.  The  present  rates  of  contribution  for  adultmen and women are as follows :                                       Men.  Women.                                    Pence.  Pence.

The  present  rates  of  benefit  for  men  andwomen are. 17s. and 15s. per week, respectively.  Inaddition there  is an  allowance for  not  more  than  * Persons over 18 years of age who remain on theRegister after having failed to satisfy  the TransitionalConditions.one adult dependant of 9s. per week and for eachdependent  child  of 2s. per week.   Fuller details ofthe present  rates  of contribution  and  benefit aregiven  in Appendix  VI.   The  Table in  AppendixVII  shows  both Unemployment  Insurance,  health and Pensions contributions together.  45.  Appendix  IV  shows the  principal rates ofbenefit  year by .year  since 1920  in relation to theCost-of-Living  Index.  It proceeds by comparing therates  actually paid each year  with those which wouldhave been payable  had they borne the same relationto the cost  of  living  as  obtains at present.Contributions paid to the Fund by the  Service T)c-    partmcnts  in respect of Discharged Men.  46.  In the Account set out above (see para.  38)the  item of   400,000,  shown  as   a receipt  from service  Departments, represents a  payment  underSection  41 of the 1920 Act,  as subsequently amended.The  arrangement is  that men  discharged from theForces  shall at  the  date  of discharge  be  put inthe position  of a man who has  just  left work with30  contributions  to  his credit in. respect  of thepreceding 30  weeks.   If unemployed and otherwiseeligible  a discharged man  can  therefore  draw ordi-nary  benefit during  a period of about 18 months.The  payment  made by  the Service Departments  ison a per-capita basis  and, together with the ordinaryExchequer contribution which it attracts, it  is thesum determined  by the Treasury to  be  sufficient toenable the consequent benefit to be paid.  The rates are fixed annually by  the Treasury  after consulta-tion with the  Government Actuary.Miscellaneous  Services borne upon  the  Fund.  47.  There  are  two  other  services   for  which expenditure is incurred  by  the Unemployment Fund,viz. :        (a) Courses of Instruction for persons under    the  age of  21.  In  this case  a grant is  made    equal to half the cost incurred by the Exchequer    in  providing courses  at  Training  and Instruc-    tion Centres for  unemployed insured persons.      (b) Grants towards  fares  of  insured   work-    people travelling  to  obtain  work at  a distance.    Here the  grant  made  is half the excess  of the    cost over  4s.The estimated charges  to  the  Fund for 1930-31  in-the above connection are :        (a)  110,000.      (b)  10,000.Administration Expenses.  48. Section 12 (3) of the Act of 1920, as amended by  subsequent  enactments, provides that the cost ofadministration of the Unemployment  Insurance Acts,which is borne in the first instance by the Vote forthe Ministry of Labour and the  Votes  for certain other Departments, shall  be  repaid  out  of the Un-employment Fund, subject to a  limit.  This limit  is12i  per cent,  of the  ordinary  net  revenue  of theFund, plus the cost -of administration of transitional benefit. The effect of these accounting  arrangements is  that the  ordinary  contribution  revenue of theFund  bears the cost of administration of ordinarybenefit,  and the Exchequer,  which  bears the cost of transitional Benefit,  defrays also  the relative costof administration.  49. The   cost   of   administration   includes  thewhole  cost  of  the  Employment  Exchanges  in  so-far  as  they  deal  with   insured  persons and  allother services which are. necessary for carrying outthe scheme.   It  further includes the expenditure in-curred  by  other  Departments  of  Government  onbehalf  of the  scheme, e.g.,  His Majesty&apos;s Office ofWorks  for  premises.   Provision  is  also made forthe accruing  cost of  pensions, etc., to  which theofficers  engaged in the  administration will he come-en titled.
  .50.  For 1030-31, it is estimated that the total costof  administration   will  be   6,380,000,  of  which 1,500,000 will be in respect of transitional benefit and  4,S80,000 in respect of ordinary benefit.  Thecharge in  respect of ordinary benefit  will be equalto about 11.8  per cent, of the ordinary net revenue of the Fund.  51.  Appendix IX  is  a comparative  statement  of administrative expenses from the commencement.  Afootnote  to the  Table  shows what percentages theadministrative expenses of Unemployment Insurancehave been of the  income of the Fund.Debt of the Fund.  52.  The  debt  of  the  Fund,  which  is  now  over 60,000,000, has  been borrowed at  rates of interestvarying between  Si  per  cent, and  4   per  cent., andthe  average rate for the debt  outstanding on  30thDecember,   1930  ( 59,990,000)  was  approximately4.8 per cent.  The loans are made  to the Unemploy-ment  Fund out of the Consolidated Fund  in accord-ance with the provisions  of  Section 5 of the Act  of1921  (as  amended),  which  also provides  that theTreasury may  borrow money in order  to provide forthe issue of the sums out of the Consolidated Fund.The Section states  that the rate of  interest shallbe fixed by the Treasury,  and,  as  the  Chancellor  ofthe Exchequer  stated in  the House of Commons on18th March, 1930,  the  Treasury make no profit onthe interest, charging  the Unemployment Fund  atthe same rate as they  themselves have  to  pay  tothe  National  Debt  Commissioners  who  actuallyadvance  the funds.   The rate  is fixed with regardto the use which the National Debt  Commissionerscould   otherwise  make  of  the money and havingregard  to  the  conditions  of the   loan.   Theseare  favourable  to   the  Unemployment   Fund  inthat it  is  enabled to borrow its exact requirementsof any  -amount at a  day&apos;s  notice  and similarly  topay  off any  amount  at any date with like notice.When repayments are made  they are set off againstthe oldest outstanding debt  at whatever the rate  ofinterest  on  that  particular  debt  may  be.   Theinterest charge on so large a  debt, amounting  toabout  3,000,000 a year, at  present absorbs  lAd. outof the total weekly contribution  of 22 $d.Salient  Figures on Finance  as at December, 1930.  53, The  salient figures  regarding  UnemploymentInsurance finance  at the end of December, 1930, maybe summarised in round figures  as follows:                                                Debt outstanding............    60,000,000                                       Per Annum.                                         43,000,000                                         14,000,000                                         16,000,000                                         15,000,000                                         88,000,000                                         22,000,000                                       *110,000,000Increasing at rate  ofContributions paid by  workpeople  ...Contributions paid  by empFoyersContributions&apos; paid by exchequer cost of  ordinary benefit and interest  paid out of FundTransitional  Benefit.

THE FUTURE OF  THE FINANCE OF UNEMPLOYMENT  INSURANCE.The   Growth  of  Debt  if  the  Scheme  remains    unchanged.  55.  The  history  of  the   Fund,  with  borrowing powers rising by stages since 1921 ( 10 millions,  20millions,   30  millions,  40 millions,   50  millions, 60 millions,   70 millions), demonstrates a  wrongrelation between income and expenditure.   The size of the gap between  revenue  and expenditure andthe magnitude of the task of making the  Fund self-supporting,  is  shown  by  the  Table  below,  whichassumes  that  the Exchequer continues to bear  thefull  cost  of transitional  benefit.  The increase  indebt indicated in the Table is thus  due entirely to ordinary benefit.  56. The table states what the position  as  regardsdebt will be at 31st March, 1932, and  at certain inter-mediate dates, on various assumptions as to the num-bers of claimants to  ordinary  benefit,  assuming  thatthe present scheme remains unaltered :  Ordinary Benefit: Growth of Debt.Average number of Claimants to ordinary benefit.	900,000	1,200,000	1,500,000	1,800,000 viz. approxi-mately as in December, 1930.	2,100,000Amount of increase in debt in 1931-2 ...

The number of claimants  to  ordinary &apos; benefit in December, 1930, when the Live Register averagedabout  2,300,000,  was  -about  1,800,000- the  exactnumbers  are not  yet  available.  If  the average  in1931 remains at this level, or rather, if the  numberof claimants to ordinary benefit remains 1,800,000,the debt  at  March, 1932,  will be  117,350,000.  58. As  appears  from  para.  25  the  Fund would indeed  continue to  run further into  debt  so longas the Live Register averages above, say,  1,275,000,made up  approximately as follows:  Claimants to  Ordinary Benefit    ......  900,000Transitional claimants and non-claimants ...  275,000Uninsured  persons   and   juvenile   non-  claimants  on the Register ...    ...    ...  100,000                                          1,275,000
&quot; Self-supporting.&quot;  59.  The Commission are instructed to make recom-mendations which will make the  Fund  solvent  and self-supporting.    A  scheme which is  to be  self-supporting, must provide its benefits and the cost oftheir  administration  out of its own revenues.    the magnitude of the present  gap between  income  andexpenditure is evident from the figures given above.Excluding transitional benefit, the  income is roughlyhalf  the  expenditure.   In  order  to  go  on  payingbenefit, as in December, 1930, to   1,800,000  persons,without running further into debt,  the income would need  to be doubled;  or, alternatively, the income isonly sufficient to  pay benefit as in December, 1930,to half the number receiving it.   In any financial proposals, it will be necessary to make some  assump-tions  as to the average unemployment to  be covered,and  the  period  over which this  average is to  betaken.  For example, should the income and expendi-ture of the Fund  be made to balance  year by year?Or  should the period  of  balancing be an extendedone?  60.  Formerly, on  the ground that  unemployment was cyclical, it was held that the period of balancingfor an Unemployment Insurance  Scheme might belong,   say  seven  or  fifteen  yean-s,  the  assumedaverage length of a trade cycle; and that the Unem-ployment Fund, if it had a reasonable level of income,could expect its surpluses in good years to balance itsdeficits in other years over such a cycle.  61.  Whether or  not this  theory would have proved a  sound basis for Unemployment  Insurance in thepre-war  world,  the  future of unemployment is  nowinscrutable,  and it  would be dangerous  to proceedthrough a further number  of bad years in faith thatthe deficits accumulating  then will be extinguishedby  surpluses  in  good  years  to  follow.  If therefore the scheme is to be  made self-supporting,  it must be financed  on some empirical basis and  adjustmentsbetween income and  expenditure must be made  oftenenough to prevent debt accumulating.  62. While  it  is  to  be  hoped that  alterations in contributions or benefits or major  conditions will notbe necessary at frequent intervals, experience of thelast  years  has shown  the necessity  for a  careful review annually say on the basis of  the experienceup to December any necessary variations being  madein the contributions and benefits for the ensuing in-surance   year    beginning   July.    Further,   itmay    be   advisable   that,   in   addition   tothe    accounts    now   presented   to   Parliamentannually,  a special  Report  should be presented toParliament every three years, reviewing the  financialposition and stating what steps have been taken inthe  interests of self-balancing,  with  an  estimate  oftheir  effect.  The present  arrangement made in S.3of the Act of 1927  is for an investigation every fiveyears and for a report on it to be laid  before  Par-liament.   63.  The Acts  already give the Minister, in conjunc-tion  with the  Treasury,  limited  powers  of  making adjustments in rates  of contributions and  benefit  see Appendix VlDII hut they apply only at  intervals of  seven years  or when the Fund is  &quot;in danger of becoming insolvent.&quot;    These  powers have not  in practice  been used.   All changes  in rates of benefit and  contributions have been made by Act of Parlia- ment;  and this should be  borne in mind in  any pro- X)proposals  that  may  be made for setting up machinery of  adjustment within the  four corners of  the scheme itself.  In any event, if the Fund is to be self-support- ing in future it will be necessary to devise machinery for ensuring that the necessary adjustments will in fact  be made whenever required.   64. The Commission  will probably  desire to leave till a later stage  in their enquiry  the  very important question of the volume of unemployment which should be assumed as  the  basis of the initial finance of the revised scheme; and if that should be less  than the unemployment  at the  date the scheme  is  launched whether, and to  what extent, it would  be justifiable to resort  to still  further  borrowing to provide themoney  required:  If borrowing  is  permitted  tem-temporarily in  certain  circumstances under the revised scheme,  it  will be  necessary  in  order to keep theFund  self-supporting  and  solvent,  to provide  safe-guards for repayment.  65. As against any tendency to base  future financeon  an  optimistic  forecast of  unemployment,  it  isnecessary to stress the  facts (a) that in the past therevenue of  the  Fund has  been depleted in an  eric-neous  belief that  the resources of  the Fund wouldbe more  than sufficient for  their  purpose and  (6)that the  growth of  debt is largely due to the view which  was commonly held that the circumstances  ofthe moment were  exceptional, and that better  tradewas  likely   soon.    It  is  highly  undesirable   toproceed   on  such   a  basis  in   future.   First,it is quite likely to lead to a  further and  large  accu-mulation  of debt  due  to  the Treasury probably abad  debt.   For the  Fund  to  borrow what it cannotrepay  is  clearly indefensible.   There would  also  be other  serious effects.   The knowledge  that such animportant service  is  piling up  debt  tends  to have a depressing effect  on industry and  on the spirit  ofenterprise on which  it depends.  Then from the  pointof view of the insured persons, unemployment benefit would  continue to be  regarded by  the  public as a&quot; dole,&quot; and insured persons would not find in theInsurance Scheme what they  have a right to expect,viz., a source of aid  in bad times upon which, because it comes  from a sound  and well-esteemed  scheme  towhich  thejT  have themselves contributed their propershare,  they  can draw  without hesitation  or loss  ofrespect.  66. In so  far  as alterations in the scheme are con-sidered to  be necessary to make it self-supporting,the  problem can  be approached from  two sides (o) increasing income and (b) reducing expenditure.It  will   be   remembered   in  connection  with any steps  taken  under  (b)  that  the   Commission  arerequired  to  make  recommendations  as  to  thearrangements which should be  made for persons out-side  the Insurance  Scheme.     This  aspect of  thematter is  referred   to  in Part IV of  this memo-randum.  67.  From a financial point of view, it is  immaterialwhether  the  steps necessary  are taken under  (a)  or(b) or partly under each, except insofar  as the pro-visions lend themselves to abuse,  or  may  be helddirectly or  indirectly to affect the volume of  unem-ployment.  From a  financial point of view, as wellas  from wider  points  of  view,  it is important thatthe  money  available,  when  the Fund  is  self-sup-porting,  should not be  distributed  in  ways of  whichthe  contributors  to the  Fund would  not approve.It  is  often overlooked that  the insurance part ofthe  scheme  consists  wholly of money contributed byor  for the  benefit of insured  persons, and to pay it out in cases which they  would not approve  would mean either (a)  that  they must pay more in totalthan  is  necessary  for what they  approve,  or  (6)that the Fund  cannot afford to pay benefit in cases which they  think more important.   68.  One obvious way of increasing the ^revenue of the Fund  is to  make  a further  grant from  the Exchequer, which could be of  any amount required, but a  fund which  drew upon the  Exchequer  as  re- quired could hardly be regarded as self-supporting. In  fact, the Fund  would  be  &quot;on  the  dole&quot;,  it would have a low place in public esteem accordingly and would  always  be an  embarrassment to  the Government of the day.   69.  At present  the Exchequer pays one-third  of the whole revenue  of the insurance scheme, that is one- half  of  what  is  paid by employer  and employed. While there are schools of thought which think that the  Exchequer contribution should  be  greater,  it should be  borne  in mind that in the present  em- barrassed  condition  of  the  exchequer,  there   are arguments   in  favour  of  reducing  it.   The regular contribution of  the  Exchequer to the  Unemploy- ment  Fund is about   16,000,000 ( 15,000,000  in
1930-1) and in addition  22,000,000 is being provided in 1930-1  for Transitional Benefit  and more  will berequired in  1931-2.  The  cost of the Social services to the  Exchequer  is  already great as will  appearfrom  a  memorandum  to  be   submitted  by  theTreasury  and  there are  growing demands for large increases  in various directions.   There is a  danger that  the  Unemployment  Eund will  be absorbingresources  which would be better employed in other social  Services.  In  the  German  scheme of  insur-ance there is no  contribution  from the exchequer at  all,  though it  contributes  largely to the non-insurance benefit.  70. The principle of equal-thirds proceeds  on thebasis  that  all. three  parties,  employer,  employed and the Exchequer, are  concerned in the affair.  Ithas been  adapted  after  controversy extending overmany years  and it would  be  most undesirable to disturb  it.  In fact it is not easy  to find any otherformula  which does  not  lend  itself  without diffi.-culty  to  an increase in the  Exchequer  contribu-tion, whenever the Fund wants more money.  Whenthe revenue  of a  self-supporting Insurance Schemeis derived equally  from  the three  parties to it, the answer  when  more benefits are demanded,  is thatif they  are  granted,  there must also be  an increaseof contributions all round.   This  provides  a check on  expenditure without imposing  an unreasonableburden  on any one of the three  parties separately.  71.  There is  a variant  of the present method of determining  the  amount  of the Exchequer  contri-bution  in any  year, a matter rather of  detail than of principle,  which it  is convenient to  examine here.At  present  the Exchequer contribution  is one-thirdof the  income of the Fund.   The alternative  sug-gested  is that  it  should be one-third  of  the ex-penditure.   In  the  long Tun, provided the Fundpays its debt, there is no difference in the financialconsequences of the two methods;  both  secure thatone-third  of  all the expenses of the  Fund is borneby  each of  the parties.  72.  The reason for the  alternative is that under thepresent method %bs4.  the  Exchequer  pays  less in  ayear of bad employment when the  calls; on the Fundare heavy,  than  in  a year of good  employment.This  is truej  it   follows from the  fact  that theExchequer  pays  one  half  of  what employers  andemployed pay;  and  they pay  less in a  bad yearbecause less people are at work.   The objection to thealternative  is that it  would cause much larger  fluc-tuations  in the Treasury contribution and  he em-barrassing to the Exchequer from  a budgetary pointof view.  A variation of 500,000 in  the number unem-ployed  causes an alteration  in the Exchequer  chargeof  600,000 on the present  basis;  whereas the planproposed  would alter the charge by  7,000 000.&quot; Solvent.&quot;  73.  The Commission are also asked to report onthe means by which the Fund may be made solvent.Certain  considerations   affecting   self-support   asregards future  expenditure having been stated  inthe last Section,  it remains to consider here whatprovision  should  be  made  for the  existing  debt.  74.  Various methods of dealing  with the debt, onthe assumption that  steps  are taken to make theScheme  self-supporting   for  the  future,  fall  into three classes  as  follows:        (a) Leave the debt as at present, to be paid    off  as and when the Fund  has a surplus  of    revenue  over  its outgoings  for benefit, adminis-    tration,  etc.      (6)  Write off the  debt due from the Fund  to    the Treasury; the debt due  fa-om the Treasury    to  the National Debt Commissioners cannot,  of    course,  be written  off, so this  method  simply    amounts to transferring  the  debt charges from    the Unemployment Fund to the Budget.      (c) Fund  the  debt,  i.e., amortise  it  over  a    number of  years  by earmarking  a portion of    the income of the Fund for the purpose.  75.  It is  an objection to the first  course  that itis  impossible  to  have any  idea  when,  if ever, the debt would  be repaid.  Further, the continuance of so  large a debt makes the Insurance  Scheme water-logged.   The   hopelessness  of repayment preventsthe financial  position from receiving the close andexacting attention which is required in so difficulta  scheme.   It is easy in  such  a situation to actas though  it  does not  matter if the  finance  getsworse.  It  would endanger the  future  of  the Tn-surance Scheme to leave things  as they are in thehope  of something turning up  to make a  radical change  in *the  financial situation;  some proper meansof  creating a more healthy &quot; balance  sheet &quot; must befound.  76.  As to (6) the  arguments which have been ad-advanced  from  time to time  for writing off the  debtare first, that the  debt is due to the Fund  being.charged with  uncovenanted, extended or transitional benefit  which  it  ought  never to  have borne; and second, that repayment  is hopeless and that a cleanstart is needed.  The  answer on the  first  part  isthat  uncovenanted  benefit  was granted  as benefitpaid  in advance of  contributions and in  order thatthere  might  be  revenue out of  which to  meet  itthe  rates  of  weekly contributions  were  increased.That  this  policy  was successful  may  be  seen  fromthe  fact that the debt fell  as  low  as   4,361,314on 13th September, 1924, and would have continuedto fall had additional benefits  not been granted fromthe Fund by  the No. 2 Act of 1924,  without furtherrevenue being provided.   77. The  facts  that (i),  additional  benefits  were granted in  1924  without the provision  of additional revenue, and  (ii), that  in  1925  and 1926, the  ratesof contribution,  which had been  increased  in  orderto cover the cost of uncovenanted benefit, were sub-stantially  reduced,  has made  it  impossible to say whether the  growth of the debt up till the  timewhen the charge for transitional  benefit  was  trans-ferred  to the Exchequer was  due to ordinary or  totransitional benefit.   78. The   second reason  would not he   a   goodground  for writing  off, if other means  of dealingwith  the situation can be found.  Whether this canbe done  is considered  below.  Here  it should  besaid  that  only  the gravest  reasons could  justifysuch  a serious step as writing off.   79. There remains the third course, to fund the debt.    By this  is  meant  an arrangement,  whichremoves it  from the ordinary accounts of the fund and provides  for  it in a special way.  The followingwill  perhaps  make  clear  the   kind  of  operationreferred to and  how it  could be carried out.  . ^   Transfer the debt to a separate account  of the    Unemployment  Fund:   provide  that  x  pence    per week  out of every  contribution paid shall  be    carried to that account to cover the interest and    sinking fund, sufficient to amortise the debt over    y years.  The initial contribution under the Te-    vised insurance scheme  would then be in two parts :    first the contribution necessary for current  insur-    ance expenditure which would be  carried to the    Insurance Account of the Unemployment  Fund,    and second the debt-funding  charge, carried  to    the Debt  Amortisation Account.   Such an  arrangement for funding would  be  futileunless  the -Insurance Account is  at  the  same  timeplaced  on a self-supporting basis,  for new  debt  mightbe growing  up  unprovided for  in  the InsuranceAccount, while old debt was, being  paid off in theAmortisation  Account.73625B
  The  National  Debt  Commissioners who  are  re-sponsible  as Trustees  for  the moneys  which havebeen advanced would necessarily have to  be consulted as to any arrangement for funding.  80. The  debt which  has  to be dealt with whenany revised scheme  is put  in force  is  likely to  bemuch  higher than the amount on  30th December.1930,  ( 60,000,000).    It may  be   80,000,000  oreven   100,000,000.   The following table shows  theannual amount which  would be required to providefor interest  and to amortise a debt of  100,000,000over  various  periods,   interest  being  assumed  at4J per cent.:    Period forAmortisation.  10 years  20 years  30 years               Equivalent  Annuity     No. of pencerequired for    per week inAmortisation.

The  Blanesburgh Ccjutoiittee proposed  a kindof funding  arrangement  in  relation to the  smallerdebt then existing ( 21,000,000) and suggested that3d. per week (Id. from each party) should be set aside for the purpose.PART IV.-FINANCIAL ASPECTS OF ARRANGEMENTS OUTSIDE THE INSURANCE SCHEME.  82.  The  Commission are  asked  to  make  reeom-mendations with regard  to  the  arrangements  whichshould be made outside the Unemployment InsuranceScheme for the hnemployed who are capable  of and available for work.Transitional Benefit.  83.  The  first  class for consideration, which is  atpresent outside the Insurance part of the Scheme,comprises  persons in receipt of  Transitional benefit which is for the time being provided  wholly  at theexpense of the  Exchequer.   They must have paid atleast  eight contributions  in  the  last two years or 30since  entry into insurance, which may go back  to 1920or,  in some trades, to  1911.  This does not necessarilymean eight weeks&apos;  employment;  it may mean  merelysome   work  in  each  of   eight  weeks.    BetweenFebruary and  May, 1930, the number of persons inreceipt of  transitional benefit increased from 140,000to about 300,000.  Of this increase 50,000 have comefrom  the  Poor Law.  The  others are for  the mostpart  persons who were  not  in  receipt  of benefit orof poor  relief,  either  because they were  disqualifiedor  because they had  not applied for it.  Thus, intransferring 50,000 persons  from the Poor Law toState maintenance, a- much larger  number, 110,000,have  been attracted  in addition.  A  considerablenumber  of those now receiving  Transitional  Benefitare not  likely, even with   improved  industrial con-ditions,  to  obtain regular insurable  employment.Transitional Benefit is in substance a  form of main-tenance  outside the Public Assistance  Scheme paidwithout  either the primary  test attaching to a con-tributory insurance scheme  or to assistance from theLocal Authority.  84. Under existing  legislation Transitional  Benefitbegins to  expire in April,  1931, and would run outgradually  during the  next year.  Further legislation will be necessary  before  that date if  this  is  not to happen.Its Cost.  85. The  estimate  approved by Parliament for  this service for 1930-31 is  22,000,000. The original esti-mate for 1930-31 was   10,500,000, but this expresslyexcluded*   provision  for  certain  classes  (married  * Paragraphs 8 and 9  of the Command Paper 3453issued on 11th December, 1929, in relation to the Billthen  before  Parliament,  were as follows:         &quot;  8. These  figures relate  to  insured  persons    whose  unemployment books are lodged  at  the    Employment Exchanges.  The possibility  should,    however, not  be  overlooked that the  new  pro-    visions may have the effect of bringing  certain    other  persons  into benefit,  for example, married     women, who  have done little or  no work since    marriage, and  seasonal workers during the &apos; off-     season.&apos;       &quot; 9. These  two classes of cases  will serve as     illustrations  of  what   in  the aggregate  may     amount to a considerable group of new claimants,     consisting  of persons who,  so to  speak,  are not     really  in the market as competitors  for  employ-     merit,  but may hold themselves out  as  such  if     they are thereby enabled to qualify  for  benefit.     There are, however, no data enabling any  esti-     mate to be made for the additional  cost  arising     under this head.&quot;women, seasonal  workers,  etc.) likely to be broughton to the Fund by the Act of 1930.  SS. It is not possible to say with any  exactitudehow  many  of the increased  numbers on transitional benefit are due to the increase in unemployment orto the  increasing failure of  people  to  be able topay 30 contributions, and how many are of the classesexcluded from the original  estimate,  but so far as can be estimated, the latter classes are likely to cost 4,000,000 in 1931-32.  87. The following figures show that the  increase in numbers and cost has been  progressive throughoutthe year:   Average number(Approx.). Average  weekly  amount(Approx.).         311,000   334,000   337,000   333,000   349,000   363,000   380,000Expenditure  during  April,  1930  ............  283,000Expenditure   during   May,  1930  ............  307,000Expenditure   during  June,  1930  ............  311,000Expenditure   during   July,  1930  ............  316,000Expenditure  during August,  1930  ............  326,000Expenditure  during Saptern-  ber, 1930  .........  340,000Expenditure  during October,  1930  ............  356,000Expenditure  during Novem-  ber, 1930   .........  373,000        395,000The   continuance   of   exceptionally  heavy  LiveRegisters must  cause  an  increasing number of  the insured population  to  fail to pay 30 contributionsduring  the preceding  two years,  and  thus in  thecomiug months,  out of  any  given number  unem-ployed, a larger  number  are likely to be on Transi-tional Benefit th*an would have been the case had theLive Register been lower.  Therefore, whether or notthe  total  amount  paid   in  benefit  (ordinary  andtransitional)   alters, an   increase  in  the  cost  of transitional  Benefit to the Exchequer in the coming months is  probable.  88. To  express the   matter  somewhat differently,whether  benefit  paid  during  the  June  quarterof 1930 was  transitional or  not  depended on  theclaimanfs employment during  the  last  two years,only  about three months of  which  was affected  bythe  present  great depression.   As the  months  goby  the part of  the &quot; two years &quot;  which is  withinthe &quot; great depression &quot; will increase.  . For example,when April,  1931,  comes if there is no  marked im-provement meantime fifteen  months  of the  &quot; twoyears &quot; will  be within the &quot; great depression &quot;  andthe  proportion will go on increasing.  It  is obviousthat many more people will fail to pay  30  coutribu-tions, during a  period when  the  Live  Register  is2,000,000 or more  than  when it  was  round  about1,000,000 or 1,200,000.  89. It is not  possible  yet  to give a  satisfactoryestimate of the cost of transitional benefit in 1931-2,but,  as a provisional  forecast  given under reserve,and  assuming  no change  is made  in existing condi-tions,  it seems  likely  that it will not be  less  than 30,000,000.
Persons at present entirely outside the U.I.  Acts.  90.  So far  as a claim for help from public fundsis  concerned,  there  is  little to  distinguish betweenthe person in  receipt of transitional benefit, who  hasmerely  paid  30  contributions since  1920, and  theuninsured  person.  That  being  so, and bearing  inmind  Uhe view  that an  unemplo3red  person  in  onetrade may have  as  much need  of help from public funds  as  an  unemployed  person  in  another trade,the question at once arises, can  (or ought)  a  scheme,whereby non-contributors are paid at  the same ratesas the contributors,  be confined  to those now repre-sented by a group of about 375,000 persons P  91.  Among employed persons the principal groupswho are at present not  covered by the UnemploymentInsurance  Scheme  at  all  number about  4,000,000including  those employed in agriculture and domes-tic service.  If these  groups  were included  withinthe new arrangements (without themselves being con-distributors to the  Fund) they would be an  important factor in  the finance;  for,  were only  5 per  cent, oftJhem to receive  payments thereunder, it  would  addbetween  9 and   10 millions per annum to the cost.If the scope of the  new arrangements is wide, theremay also  be  claims  from  persons who  normally workon their  own account but whose incomes  are   in-adequate.  92. An   important  consequential  problem would arise in relation  to the  Insurance Scheme itself,  ifpayments under  non-contributory  arrangements out-side the  Insurance  Scheme become widespread  andmany  receive  for nothing payments   similar to  thebenefits under the  Insurance  Scheme. In such  cir-cumstanees those who are contributing to  the Unem-ployment  Insurance   Scheme  would  be  likely  to demand to be relieved of liability to contribute.Public  Assistance.   93. The cost to Local Authorities of outdoor relief to persons ordinarily engaged in  some regular occu-pation was about  5,700,000  in the  year  to March,1930.   Had the  Unemployment  Insurance  Act, 1?30,not been passed, the  expenditure would  have  been much greater for  the financial  year 1930-31.   Infact, it is proving  much less.  In the six  months to30th  September, 1929,  it  was   2,800,000;  in   the six  months   to 30th  September,   1930,  it   was 1,650,000,  a  reduction  of  about   40   per  cent.,in  spite  of  (the  immense   increase   in unem-ployment.  Probably  there need  be  little  separateaddition  to  the estimated cost  of the new  arrange-ments  in respect of persons now aided by  the Public Assistance Authorities, for many of  them would  beincluded  in  the groups,  now  outside  tho  Unemploy- mont Insurance  Acts, referred to in the  previousiSection.Summary of  Classes outside the Insurance Scheme.   94.  The classes who may  be  within the  arrange- ments  which the Commission may  recommend for per- sons outside tlhe  Insurance  Scheme  will thus  pre- sumably be made up of some or all of the following :         (a)  Those now entitled  to Transitional Benefit.       (b) Persons at present outside the  Unemploy-     inent  Insurance  Acts; able  bodied  unemployed     now   maintained   by  the  Public   Assistance     Authorities. If any persons  now entitled to ordinary unemploy- ment benefit should  not  be so  entitled  under  thy scheme which the  Commission recommend,  they will also  fall  to  be  dealt  with under the arrangements ouside the scheme.   Whatever may be the  view taken as to the right policy to pursue  in  respect of these classes, it is obvious  that they  present  formidable financial problems.Elements  in  the Cost of the new arrangements  out-            side the Insurance Scheme.  95.  The cost of  the new arrangements outside theInsurance Scheme will be mainly dependent on      (a)  The persons to whom they apply.      (6)  The rate of  payment made to them.      (c)  The rules governing the payments.      (d)  The machinery of administration.Little can be  added to  what is  said  above aboutthe cost of the arrangements until  the  Commissionprovisionally determine the lines  on which estimates should proceed.  96. The formulation of a plan is complicated by thevariety of types which may be covered.   Some have throughout their working lives been regular workersuntil a few years  ago; some are in the prime of life,but many are elderly men.  Others are people whohave  never established  a footing  in  industry.   some are people who are practically unemployable,  or  atleast  unlikely  to  get any  work except  in a  boomperiod. There were on 26th May, 1930, about 90,000persons drawing  Transitional Benefit who had  notpaid  even one contribution,  in  the last two years andthere was a  large number who had paid few.   some are people who have done  no  work for a number ofyears.  97. If  those  now wholly  outside the insurancescheme are admitted to the new arrangements, theremay  be found among them a  still greater variety oftype than among those now entitled to  transitional benefit.    It  seems obvious,  therefore,  that  thearrangements outside must be  of an elastic character,and that  the cost will be affected very largely by thenature of the rules.  98. It  will be necessary,  in framing the rules, to-bear in  mind that any new  arrangements of  thiskind will  attract persons who have for some reason or  another not claimed under the existing schemes,. unless  tho rules  are  drawn  so as to prevent  this possibility. Sources of the money.   99. Broadly speaking, the  possibilities in  regardto  sources of  the money are  three :         (a) contributions by  the  employer,  employed     and  the Exchequer;       (b)  local rates,  with or  without  a grant from     the Exchequer;       (c)  entirely from the Exchequer.   100. In regard to (a), contributions  by employers, employed and the Exchequer.   In so far as this group is made up of persons now  receiving ordinary  benefit, there would be  some justification  for placing  part of  the cost  on  contributions in  future.  It  would need to be borne in mind that the payments under the  scheme are  to go to  persons  who  do  not pay many contributions.    &quot;While  it  may  be considered that the  others should be  asked  to  contribute  to the help of their fellows,  it could be  argued with some force that the Exchequer  should come  more largely to the aid of tbe arrangements outside the insurance scheme&quot;than is represented  by the &quot; equal thirds &quot; principle  of that scheme.   101. In regard  to (b), local  rates.   First, they have always borne  a part at least  of this burden ;  second, unemployment is  one of  the  factors  taken  into account in the distribution of grants under the Local Government  Act, 1929; third, it would be advan- tageous  if local  authorities with their local experi- enco oould  share in  the  administration; and if  so it  would seem to follow that they should bear  a part of the cost.   Against putting any part of the burden on  local  authorities,  it may  be urged that the ser- vice ought not.to be loft even partly in their hands and that local rates are already in many cases too heavy a  charge.73025
  102. As  to (c),  in  favour of  placing  the  whole cost on the Exchequer, it may  be urged :      (i) that  the  relief of  the  able-bodied unemployment-    ployed ought to be a national charge;      fii) that  in some cases the burden  would  be    more  than  the  local   authority,  already  im-    poverished,  could  bear.  Against, the  arguments are:       (i) that the  expenditure is of a  kind  better    controlled locally,  with  the  aid  of  local  know-    . l^dge.       (ii)  that  the difficulty  arising  from  the  in-    ability of certain areas to bear the burden hasbeen  rendered less  acute  by the  Local  Govorn-ment Act, 1929, which greatly enlarged the areasover which  the burden  is spread.  In so far asthe  difficulty  persists  it  ought  to  be  met  by making  them a  special  grant  from the  Ex-chequer ;  (iii) that  local rates  have always borne a  sub-stantial  share  of  this  burden  till  lately;  and still bear  a part;   (iv) that   the  Exchequer  is  already  heavilyburdened  and that  this charge would be aserious addition to its  permanent commitments.

JULY, 1912, TO NOVEMBER, 1920.  1.  The Unemployment Fund was  established underthe National&apos;Insurance  Act,  1911,  which came intooperation on the 15th July,  1912.  2.  The income of the Fund was derived from con-tributions paid by employers  and insured persons andby the  Exchequer.    The  expenditure of  the Fundconsisted  mainly   of  payment  of  UnemploymentBenefit  and costs  of administration.  3.  The Act of 1911 covered about 2i million work-people.   The weekly rates  of contribution were 2Jd.each for employer and adult employed and Tfd. fromthe Exchequer.  The weekly rate of benefit was  7s.for adults.  Benefit was  payable from 15th January,1913 after a  waiting period  of six days  and  was limited  to one week for each five  weeks&apos;  contribution-tions and to  15 weeks  in 12 months  (subsequentlyaltered  to Insurance Year).   The Act  also providedfor the  refund of  the  workmen&apos;s  contributions incertain  circumstances on reaching the age of 60 andfor arrangements to be made with  Associations  forthe repayment of sums paid by  them to their mem-bers which  they would  otherwise  have received asUnemployment Benefit.  4. Administration expenses were to be borne by theFund up to the limit of  one-tenth of  its receipts,and  powers to borrow were provided up to  3,000,000in case of need.  5.  There were amending Acts in 1914 and 1915 but no great change was made  until  September,  1916,when in view of the possible position at the end ofthe  War the scope of Unemployment Insurance was extended temporarily to cover an additional li million workers mainly engaged in the manufacture of muni-tions.   Except as  regards refunds  of contributionsat the  age  of 60  these  workers were, in the main,subject  to the conditions previously  in operation.Unemployment during  the period.  5. The mean percentage rates of unemployment ininsured  trades  during the calendar years 1913 and1914 were 3.6  and  4.2 respectively.  For the subse-quent  calendar years affected by  the War the per-centage rates were:      1915 ...    ...    ...    ...    ...    ...    1.2    1916 ...  &apos;  ......    ...    ...    ...     .6    1917 ...    ................6    1918  (to  November)   ..........7For the insurance years (July to July) the percentagerates were :      1918-19    ...............    5.3    1919-20    ...............    6.0Financial position oj the Fund.  7.  At the time of the Armistice in November, 1918,the  accumulated  investments  of  the  Fund  had reached    15,235,000   and   by   December,   1919, 19,133,000.  The  Act of 1919 which came into force at Christinas increased the rate of benefit from 7s. to11s.  The balance of the Fund, however, continued to accumulate- until in November, 1920, the investmentsamounted to  21,875,000.   II.-8wi NOVEMBER,  1920, TO 3RD JULY, 1921.  .8.  The  Act of 1920, which came into force on 8thNovember, 1920,  extended the scheme of  insurance to cover,  with certain exceptions,  all manual workersabove the age of 16, numbering about Hi millions.  9.  The  weekly rates of contributions for  men were raised to8d.* (4d. each for employers and employed persons) and 2d. for the Exchequer.  The weekly rateof benefit was increased to 15s.*   The waiting period  * Throughout the  Appendix, *-eferencf  is made tothe rate for an adult male.  The various  rates of con-tribution and benefit are detailed in Appendix II.SUCCESSIVE  CHANGES  IN LEGISLATION AND  BYavE REGISTER.was reduced to three days and one week&apos;s  benefit waspayable for  every  six  weekly contributions.  Theformer limit of 15 weeks in  an Insurance Year wasretained but  a  special concession was  made to meetthe case  of newly insured persons by which eight weeks&apos;  benefit  was  allowed  during  the  first year after  the  passing of the  Act  if  four contributionshad been paid.   10. Tho  Act also provided  for (a) the  continuanceand extension of the arrangements made under  the1911 Act for the refund of contributions in  certaincircumstances to persons  aged 60, (b)   the  settingup of special (industry)  schemes outside  the generalscheme and (c)  payment by the Service departments of certain sums to allow a man discharged  from theForces to have  a credit of contributions sufficient toentitle him to  the maximum amount of benefit for a year.   11.  It was also provided  that  the Fund  shouldcontinue to bear the expenses of  administration  upto the limit of one-tenth  of its income, but owingto the  accumulated reserves of the Fund no provision for borrowing powers was  included. Course of  Unemployment.   12.  When the Act  of 1920 came into  force the great depression  in trade began to reveal  itself and the figures of  wholly unemployed rose from 494,106 at the  end  of  November  to  701,179 at  the  end of December.   In January, 1921,  the total number of persons registered at  Exchanges rose  from 1,010,021 to  1,276,577,  and in  February  from 1,329,130 to 1,465,316.   13.  By this time  the  eight  weeks&apos;  special benefit had  been  largely  exhausted  and, as Out-of-Work Donation  was only  in operation for ex-Service men until  31st  March, 1921, some special provision  was necessary  to  meet this increasing  rate of unemploy- ment.  The Act  of 1921, which came  into operation on the 3rd March, increased  the maximum amount of benefit payable in a year to 26 weeks and instituted &quot; Uncovenanted  Benefit &quot; (i.e.,  benefit  allowed to persons who had exhausted their  contribution rights. or in some circumstances had paid no contributions at all) which could be paid up to a limit of  16 weeks in each  of  two special  periods* and (in  view  of  the Out-of-Work Donation rate  (20s.)  and the high cost of living)  increased  the weekly rate of benefit to 20s.   14. The increased  cost was to be met by a proposed increase  in  the rates of contributions  from July, 1921,f but to  meet contingencies that  might arise from  these big changes should employment  not  im- prove, borrowing powers  for  the Fund up  to   10 millions were provided.   15. The  live register  continued  to  mount,  largely owing to the  Coal  Dispute, from 1,509,029 on  4th March, 1921, to 2,580,429 on the 3rd of June and then  fell back  to 2,438,125 at the end of June. Financial  Position  of the Fund.    16..The  investments of the Fund had decreased by the end  of June, 1921, to  2,600,000 and a loss of about  If millions weekly was then being incurred. The Coal Dispute was at its height and special measures had to be taken.  These  resulted in  the No. 2  Act of  1921 which  reduced the rates of benefit from 20s. to  15s. from the 30th June and  increased the wait- ing period to 6 days.  The rates of contribution from 4th July, 1921, were further increased to Is.  3d. (Sd. Employers,  7d. Employed) and 3fd.  for  the  Ex- chequer.   The period  of  uncovenanted  benefit  was    * First  special period  3rd  March, 1921,  to  2nd November, 1921; second special period 3rd November, 1921,  to 2nd July,  1922.    t These  rates were never operative,  being super- superseded by  those in the No. 2 Act of 1921.
increased at the discretion of the Minister from  16weeks to 22 weeks in each of  the  two special periodsreferred  to above.  Borrowing powers were increasedto  20 millions.  17.  During the period November,  1920,  to  July,1921,  the receipts of the Unemployment Fund were 12,400,000  including  Exchequer grant   1,540,000and the expenditure  34,510,000.  The credit balanceof   22,210,000  which the Fund  had  in  November,was in  consequence reduced to about  100,000.III.

As a result of the reduction  in the rate of bene-fit by the No. 2 Act of  1921, the continued high rateof unemployment and the exhaustion of Trade Unionresources,  consideration was  given  to  the paymentof  more benefit to those  who had  dependants the out-of-Work Donation Scheme allowed supplementarypayments for dependent children and in November,1921,  the Unemployed Workers&apos;  Dependants  (Tem-porary  Provision)  Act was  passed  as  a temporary measure  for six months.  It was ancillary to the mainscheme but  financially independent of it.  additional contributions were provided for (2d. each from Em-ployers and  employed and 3d. from the Exchequer)and payment of 5s. a  week for an  adult dependantand Is. a week for each child  was authorised.  20.  By the Act of 1922 which  came into force  onthe 6th  April  the Dependants&apos; Scheme was mergedinto the Unemployment Insurance Scheme.  This Actalso cut  short tho second special period and providedfor uncovenanted  benefit for two  further specialperiods (third  and (fourth special  periods).*  A  maxi-mum of  15 weeks might be drawn in  the third specialperiod which  in  certain circumstances was dividedinto three  groups of five weeks each separated  bygaps of five weeks.  A maximum of 22 weeks withoutgaps could be drawn during the fourth special period which included the winter months.  21. Under this Act also,  provision was made for theFund to bear the expenses of administration up to a limit of  one-eighth  (instead of one-tenth) of receipts and  the   borrowing  powers  were  extended   to 30,000,000  during the &quot;deficiency period &quot;t  only.(It was  left that at the end  of the deficiency periodborrowing  powers  would  automatically  drop  to 19,500,000,   i.e.,   the   former   20,000,000   less 500,000 apportioned  to  Northern  Ireland by  theJoint Exchequer Board.)Course of  finance  of Fund.  22. During  the  period 7th November,  192],  to5th  April,  1922,  while  a  separate &apos; DependantsFund   was  in   existence  that   Fund   showed   a profit of   618,321 (Receipts  4,655,622,  Expendi-ture   4,037,301).

In July, 1922, the continued high rate of unem-ployment led to the  No. 2  Act of  1922 which  in-creased the maximum  benefit payable  during thethird special period 5  to 22 weeks and reduced thegaps between benefit to one week  each.  25.

Provision was also made for  a maximum  of  26 weeks&apos; standard benefit  in  a  year based on the  contribution  rule of one week&apos;s benefit  for every six  contributions and for a statutory right to extended benefit, i.e., benefit not based  on  the  &quot;1  in  6&quot;  contribution  rule subject  to  the  fulfilment of certain conditions.

It then fell again to  1,102,400 by the  21st December. After Christmas it rose to 1,251,706 and then fell rapidly until on the 26th April it was 981,877.

The contemplated measures in connection  with the  Widows&apos;,  Orphans&apos;,  and  Old &apos;Age  Contributory Pensions  Bill,  which  would throw an  additional  bur- den on industry, led  to a reconsideration of the Un- employment  Insurance position and in August, 1925, the 1925  Act was  passed.  It provided for reductions in  the weekly rate of contributions  of  2d. for em- ployers and  2d. for employed  making Is. 3d.  as the joint contribution  instead of Is. 7d. as before.  The Exchequer contribution remained  at 6Jd. until 5th April,  1926,  when it  was  to be increased to 8d. until 1st January, 1928, when it was to fall  to 7d. subject in each case  to the proviso that  it should  be increased by Id.  if  at the  end of the  quarter the&quot;Treasury advances plus accrued  interest exceeded the 1925  debt, viz.,   7,262,568. The reason for the revised Exchequer contribution from 2nd January, 1928, was that the Fund would from that date  be saving a sum estimated by the Actuary at  2,100,000 a  year  in  consequence  of  the operation  of  the Widows,&apos; Orphans&apos;, and  Old Age Contributory Pen- sions Act by  which  persons over 65 years of age would,  from that date,  become exempt  from  unem- ployment insurance and  not entitled  to  benefit.  35. The Act  also provided for the restoration from August, 1925,  of the Ministers discretion to grant extended benefit and for an increase  in  the waiting period from three  days to  six  days.
  36. Before,  however, the  relief to the  Fund in-tended  to  be afforded by the  increase  in the Ex-chequer  contribution  could  be  felt, the  need  for national economy led to the  passing of the Economy(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act,  1926, which not onlyrepealed the proposed  increase in the Exchequer con-tribution  but also  reduced the  Exchequer grant  to6d.

The rapid decline in the Live Register not onlyprevented  the  debt  of the  Fund from increasing,notwithstanding the reduction in contribution  rates,but  resulted in a  slight reduction from    7,262,569on  31st December,  1925,  to  7,137,569  on the 1stMay, 1926.

At the end of January,  1927,  the  Unemploy-ment Insurance Committee under  the chairmanship of Lord Blanesburgh  issued its report, and  a  large part of its  recommendations  were  accepted and em-.bodied in the 1927 Act which came  into force on the2nd  July,  1928.   Under  the  provisions of the  Act,rates  of  contribution  were   unaffected  except  asregards young  persons between the ages, of 18&apos;and20, for whom lower rates,  both of  contribution and benefit, were prescribed.  Benefit rates for men were reduced to  17s., but  the dependants&apos;  rate for adultswas  increased  to 7s.  46. The conditions governing  the relation of benefitto contributions were altered  and benefit was payablewithout limit if not less than  30  contributions hadbeen paid in the two years preceding the date  ofclaim.  Special provisions  were made to  cover the transition from tho old conditions to the new  for aperiod of 12  months from the passing of  the  Act.  47. The   debt  of  the  Fund  had increased  to 27,860,000 by the 3rd  of  November, and as it was still increasing,  further  borrowing powers were ob-tained by the  1928  Act which was  passed on the28th November.  Bv this Act the borrowing powers were increased to  40,000,000 with the proviso that
after  31st  December,  1930,  no  further  advancesshould be made until the  amount of  the advancesfell below   30,000,000,  which  amount should thenbe the maximum borrowing powers.  48.  On the 27th  March,  1929,  the UnemploymentInsurance (Transitional  Provisions Amendment) Actwas  passed  to extend for  a  further  period of  12months the  period laid down in the 1927 Act duringwhich transitional benefit should be paid.Course of Finance  of Fund.

It  provided for an additional Exchequer grant to the Fund equal to the cost of transitional benefit and the  related costs of administration in  respect ofBenefit years  commencing from 31st March,  1929.At  the same time, the transitional  period was furtherextended  to 18th  April, 1931.

For example the Index of 1925 was rather more than    10 per cent, above  the Index of  1930; the equivalent rate for  1925 is therefore rather more  than  10 per cent.    above the rate in 1930, i.e., 18s.

The  Table on the  next two pages  attempts to answer questions which are sometimes asked regardingthe  industries in which workpeople  draw more in umemployment  Benefit  than is represented by thecontributions of the industry and as to those in whichthe workpeople draw  less.   For a  variety  of reason explained below, it is  not possible to give an entirely satisfactory answer  to such questions, but the  tableproceeds on the only basis  available, namely by esti-mating the contributions and benefits paid in respectof  the insured  persons in the various  industriesaccording to the industry classification shown on theUnemployment Books. i.e., the books in  which theinsurance stamps are  affixed in payment of contribu-tions.  2. The  general  rule governing the classification ofinsured persons on their Unemployment Books is thatthey  are  classified  for  each insurance  year in theindtistries in  which  they were employed at the begin-ning of the year, viz  : in July when the annual ex-change of Unemployment  Books takes place; or,  ifnot then employed in an insured trade, in the insuredindustries in which they were last employed.  3. It follows  that individuals who  happen at thedate of the classification to be employed  casually out-side the industry to which  (if any) they really &quot; be-long &quot; are classified according to their temporary em-ployment; but with the large numbers involved suchcases probably to  a large extent cancel out, except asregards some seasonal occupations.  A  more import-ant point perhaps is that persons who have been un-employed for long periods  remain for the most partclassified  under their old  industry,  although theymay have no chance  of being again employed in it.  4. On  the  other  hand,  there are  many insuredpersons  who,  after years   of regular work  in oneindustry, get work in another industry or  industries,but only irregularly,   and   are  classified  under oneor  other  of the  latter;  and  there  are  also many who  cannot  be  said  really to  &quot; belong &quot;  to anyparticular industry.   These  miscellaneous  groups,though  not  numerically  very  large,  cost  entirelydisproportionate amounts in benefit.  5. To  sum  up, even  supposing  there were  meansof  determining  to  what  industry every  man&apos;s un-employment,  however prolonged,  should be related,it would  in numerous cases not be his last industry,as assumed in this  table.   Consequently, while  the table  is of  value  for  general study,  the resultsshown  by  it  are somewhat  arbitrary  and  do  notnecessarily bear a close relation to the results whichwould appear if there were a basis on which the costof Unemployment Benefit could be divided equitablybetween  industries.  6.  No special allowance has been made in the table for the case of industries  in  which there has beenshort time working,  because   adequate  information is not available.  It  is possible that  this  does  not affect the results largely.  A full payment of benefithas been  allowed for those actually  recorded as  un-employed at the weekly  count made for the Minis-try^  statistics, though some  only received a  partweek&apos;s payment.   On the other hand, in many cases there are  others  who received a part  week&apos;s  pay-ment but who, not  being unemployed on the day ofthe count, are not  included in the statistics of  un-employed  on  which the Table is  based.   In  other respects also,  general assumptions &apos;have had  to bemade which,  while  correct on the  whole,  may  notbe accurate  as applied to  particular industries.  Itis not possible, with existing data, to make  the par-ticular  adjustments  which,  on a  full investigation,the figures for particular industries might  be  foundto require.  7. The  contributions  paid by employers, and  em-ployed persons are  not shown separately, but gener-ally speaking  it would  be approximately correct toassume that the contributions  paid by the employers are  53  per cent, and the workpeople  47 per cent.of the combined contributions as shown in the  table.  8. The  year  of the Coal Dispute, 1926^27, has been omitted.  The table shows  two years before the  act of 1927  came  into  force and  two years after.   Theaverage Live Register of all industries taken  together in those  years were     1925-26............   1,214,026    1927-28      ............   1,083,964    1928-29      ...........&apos;.   1,283,786    1929-30      ............   1,283,020  9. The  table  includes  all   benefit  paid  whetherordinary  or. transitional or extended.  The specialcontribution  of   3,985,000 paid  by the exchequer for transitional benefit in 1929-30  is not included for there are no means  of ascertaining how much transi-tional benefit was paid in respect of each industry.

The Exchequer contribution to Health and Pensions Insurance is not paid as a weekly conrribution like the contribution to  Unemployment Insurance.   In Health Insurance, taking for example the case of men, one-seventh ofthe total cost of Health Benefits and administration is met by an Exchequer Grant ; in the long run this equals aboutlid. (minimum).   Tho Exchequer Grant for Pensions is on an,ascending scale from  4,000,000 (equal  to about lid.)for the year 1929-30,  9,000,000 for  1930-31 and thereafter an increase of  1,000,000 a ytar up to a maximum of 21,000,000 which  will be reached about the year 1942-43.  This is apart from the cost of the central  administrationof Health Insurance and the Vote for Old Age Pensions.
li  Sections, IS and 16 of the Unemployment InsuranceAct, 1920, which are still in force,  read as follows:    15. (1) If it  appears  to  the Treasury at  any time that the  unemployment fund is in all the circum-stances of the case in danger of becoming insolvent,the  Minister  shall, if  the Treasury  so direct,  byorder make such temporary  modifications in any  ofthe  rates. of contribution, or the rates or periods of unemployment benefit, and during such period,  asthe  Minister thinks fit,  and as. will on the  whole,in the opinion of the Treasury be  sufficient  to securethe solvency of the unemployment  fund :    Provided that no order under this Section shall       (a) come  into force  until one  month after it     is made;  or      (b) reduce the  weekly rate   of  unemployment     benefit below the sum, in  the case of men,  of     thirteen  shillings,  and,  in the case of women,     of ten shillings; or      (c) increase the rates of  contribution by  more     than one  penny  from the employer  and one     penny from the employed person per person per     week; or      (d) increase  those  rates unequally  as between     employers and employed persons.  (2) An order  under  this  Section  shall not be made so as to be in force at  any time  while any previousorder made under this Section is  in  force.  (3) On an order being made under this Section theMinister shall cause the  order, together with a special report  as to the reasons for making the  order,  tobe laid before Parliament.  16.  If  at  any time  after the  expiration  of  seven years from the commencement of this Act it appearsto the Minister that the unemployment fund is, in-sufficient  or  more  than  sufficient  to  discharge  the liabilities imposed  upon  the  fund  under  this  Act,or that  the  rates  of  contribution  are excessive  ordeficient,  or  if  at  any time  after  the expiration ofthree years from  the  commencement of this Act itappears to the Minister that  an equalisation of con-tribution and  benefit  between men  and women isdesirable, the  Minister may, with the sanction of theTreasury, by  special  order, made in  manner here-herein after  provided, revise the rates of  contribution ofemployers and employed persons under this Act, and,where any such order  is made, the  rates prescribed by  the  order shall, as from  such  date as may be specified in the order, be  substituted for  the ratesprescribed by this  Act :  Provided  that       (a) Where a revision of the  rates of  contribu-    tion  has been made under this Section, no further    revision shall  be made  under this Section before    the  expiration of  seven years  from  the  last    revision; and      (b) No order under this Section shall increase    the rates of contribution by more than one penny    from the  employer and one  penny  from the em-    ployed person  per  person per  week above the    rates specified  in the Third Schedule to this Act;    and      (c)  No  order  under  this  Section  shall  vary    these rates  of  contribution unequally  as between    employers and employed  persons.73625DEXISTING  POWERS FOB.

ESTIMATES  OF VARIOUS ITEMS  OF RETVENUE  AND  EXPENDITURE.A. Income.  1.  The following paragraphs show the produce of a contribution of  Id. from persons  at present insuredand  the amounts which would   be  received  from various other classes if included within the scheme :        (a) A  contribution of  Id.  per week  for  per-    sons over 18 (and Jd. for juveniles) yields about     2,000,000  per  annum  with  2,300,000 unem-    ployed.   Id.  per  week  from  each of the parties    (employers,  employed and the  Exchequer)  thus    produces  6,000,000.      (b) Non-manual  workers whose  remuneration    exceeds   250 per  annum  are  not at  present    within  the  Scheme.  If those  whose remunera-    tion does not exceed  500 were brought within    the Scheme,  this would at present  rates of  con-    tribution add about             to the  revenue.Against  this would have  to  be set the benefitto which these persons would  be  entitled  andthe cost  of  administration.  (c) Excepted persons in the service of public authorities,  national  and local,  and StatutoryCompanies are not at present  required to  pay contributions.   If  they  paid  contributions atpresent rates,  the  amount, when  added to the consequential contributions from the Exchequer,is  estimated  at from  3 millions to  4 millions per annum.  (d) If the present special schemes for the Bank-ing and Insurance Lidustries  were cancelled andthe persons  in these industries  were  requiredto contribute  to  the general fund at present rates,  this would  add a  net income  of  about 350,000 per annum to the general Fund.B. Expenditure.  2. Bates of Benefit. The following Table indicates the unit cost  of various items of benefit:   	Unit.	Annual Cost with a Live Register of 2,300,000.				Ordinary Benefit.

Mules and Conditions as to Benefit. The cost ofthe scheme is dependent also on the rules and condi-tions which  govern  the payment of  benefit.   Thevarious  rides  governing the  receipt  of  benefit andthe  various  groups  making  up  the  total number in receipt of benefit are so numerous as to preclude the submission of a comprehensive series of estimates,but if desired an endeavour would be made to furnish,so far as practicable,  estimates  of  the amount ofbenefit paid to any particular groups or the financial effect of any variation in a  rule which  the  Corn-mission  may wish to examine.C. Additional Bates of  Contribution required  for  balancing  with various numbers on benefit.  4.
