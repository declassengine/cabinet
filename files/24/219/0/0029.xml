I submit herewith tho Admiralty proposals for the1931 Naval Construction -Programmeo   The vessels will, ingeneral,, be ordered, towards the close of the financial year1931 and the provision Involved in 1931 Is accordingly small.A decision is, however required as early as possible inorder that the Havy Estimates 1931 may bo ready fo*&quot;presentation to Parliament at the proper time.       The proposals, which are in accordance with theterms of the Ionion Treaty, follow in general,  thelines indicated in the Admiralty Memorandum which I circulated,   jafter the termination of the London Haval Conference(FoSo (29)  6) and are on the assumption that Article 21 oftho T-raafey will not be  required to he operated.  The programmedoes not oall for any special comment now, except that  r -would draw attention to the fact that a small cruiser  oxapproximately 5,000 tons is included  in the 1931 programme in lieu of one of 7,000 tons.  As  it will be necessary under the limitations imposed by the London Naval Treaty to have  acertain number of cruisers of small tonnage in the ?leet tomake up our numbers, it has been thought desirable to  includeone in the 1931 programme  in order that experi-ence mas  be gained with the design  before any more of the type  are  ordered.        &apos;The  total estimated cost of  the 1931 proposals( 9,004,100)  compares favourably with the  estimated cost ofthe 1930 programme, originally  reported as  9,613,900,  but now anticipated to work out at  just over  9,500,000c                                A.

Alliil&quot;                PIGHglMg SBBVICBS OOMMIgTES^         Memorandum, by the  First Lord of the-  Admiralty on       some  further aspects  of  the  Naval Construction Programme,       1931.            In view of *h e discussions which  have taken place on     the financial  situation and with particular reference to the.     suggestion  that defence expenditure ought to be made to show a     large  reduction, I feel it is important  that I should put     before  the  Fighting Services Committee some further aspects  of     the question of the Naval  Shipbuilding Programme looked at from     this point  of  view.             In  the first place I would draw attention to the small     extent  to which     1931 Programme features in the problem of     the 1931 Budget.  It will be observeu from the ,Sable attached                                                   -O y     to my Memorandum already circulated (PoS.  (29Vthat the     provision proposed in 1931 is only  52,600.  Looked at as an     immediate problem, therefore, it cannot be said to bulk at all     large a              There are, moreover, on the positive side consider-Ttic     ations in favour of pursuing a steady course with our ship-     building programme which we cannot afford  to overlook.             I may refer very briefly to the employment aspect of     the matter  which has been considered by the Committee at some     length already in connection with the programmes of the years     1929 and 1930.  The importance of avoiding heavy discharges in     the Royal Dockyards on the one hand, and the serious situation     in which the shipbuilding industry finds itself are matters     familiar to the Committee.  The Shipbuilding Employers.11
                                                          2Z1Fed-elation and the Local  Authorities on the Tyneside are urging the Government to press on with the Naval Construct ion Programme so  as to help  them  over their difficulties In 1931.  The proposal before  the Committee is, however, to maintain our steady rate  of progress ordering the 1931 ships  towards the end of  the financial year, in accordance with recent practice ? The Admiralty propose to divide  the programme between the Boyal  Dockyards  and  the  shipbuilding firms  on the same principle  as in the  last two years, and it would  be impossible to save  the  cost of the Dockyard work otherwise  than by discharging large numbers &quot;of workmen from Admiralty employment  at  the  three Yards.   Such an event would load  (1) to fresh difficulties with  the T.U.C, who have already  been pressing strongly for compenation to the discharged workers, and ( 2)  to the  expenditure  of very large suras  on unemployment benefit. This  would also apply to discharges  from contract yards .               A furthex1&apos;  result of a  large  curtailment in Naval building under the Treaty would be to  leave  a  still larger proportion of  the heavy  overhead charges  in Contract yards to be  borne not only  by  the  remaining  Naval work  but also by Mercantile contracts, thus  handicapping shipbuilders in tendering for  commercial work.            There is  a further important  aspect of the  question on the side of international policy.  Adherence by this country to a steady building  programme under the terras of the London Naval  Treaty is the course  Best  calculated to  create an atmosphere favourable to further agreement on  the part  of foreign Powers..   I have  already pointed out that  our proposals are based upon the Treaty provisions and upon  the assumption that it Viill pot he necessary for ua to exerise our rights
p 9 Q(j (j 0of derogation ua&amp;av Article 21.  It must be recognised,however, that the two continental Powers have not yet seentheir way to agreement within the terms of the Treaty andit is by no means out of the question that their attitude maynecessitate our putting Article 21 into force and stipulatingfor an increase of tonnagea  At the present moment anyindications of weakness on our part would undoubtedly decreasethe hopes of agreement between Prance and Italy, whereas thereis no doubt that the attitude this country has adopted up to now has been of very beneficial effect.  On these groundsalone, therefore, any departure from a steady programmewithin the new Treaty limitation would be harmful and ought not, I think, to be contemplated.Ao   V.

COPY HO.CABINET.COMMITTEE ON THE FIGHTING SERVICES.Naval Construction. Promme, 1951.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.      (l)   In his Memorandum of the  17th December 1950 (F. S. (29)39) , the First Lord of the  Admiralty submitsproposals for the 1931 Naval Construction Programme at atotal estimated coot  of  9,004,100.      (2)   It will be recalled that  in his Memorandum of the27th May 1930 (F.S. (29)30) , the First Lord referred todiscussions which had taken place, first before the Committeeand subsequently with myself, as to  the possibility of anamended programme which should be loss expensive then that putforward originally by the Board of Admiralty on the 9th May .1930(F.S.(29)26) (I shall refer hereafter to these two programmes as the &quot;amended&quot; and the &quot;original&apos;&apos;  programme, respectively).At the eleventh meeting, held on June 3, 1930, the committee recommended &quot;that only the 1950 Construction Programme should now be decided upon, and that no commitments for future years,except in so far as the latter will  be affected by constructionstarted in 1930, should now be entered into&apos;; and in view ofcertain considerations which were .set out in their Report, they agreed &quot;to accept the Admiralty&apos;s proposals for the present year&quot;.      (3)   That recommendation, which was subsequently endorsed by the Cabinet, leaves us free to consider the Programme for 1931without prejudice, in the light of present circumstanoes.      (4)   The proposals now put forward by the FirstLord are nearly identical with those of the &quot;original&quot;
O 9 0-rJ Cj I?Admiralty programme, but one of the three cruisers isto be of a new smell type/costing .0425,000 less then the larger &apos;isander1 class.     (5) Appendix A attached to this Memorandum showsthet the &quot;original&quot; programme for the 4 years 1930-3(assuming that, of the IS cruisers proposed therein, atleast 3 are of the new small type) will cost about  5-fmillion more than the &quot;amended&quot; programme.  It is truethat by the decision of last summer in respect of the1930 Programme we are already committed to  1-g- million of this extra expenditure.  But no part of that expenditure has yet been incurred;  I have still tofind the money for it in future Navy Estimates; and thefact that this commitment has been entered into makes it all the more incumbent on me to scrutinise the presentAdmiralty proposals with the utmost care,     (6) Since last summer the financial  outlook&apos;has changed profoundly for the worse; nor is there any prospect of early recovery.  Yet the Indications are that, in default of any marked change in  national orinternational policy, the Defence Estimates, and particul&amp;r-ly Navy and Air Estimates, will tend over the next fewyears to rise, possibly by several millions.  At anytime I should regard such a prospect with serious concern;  under present financial conditions it is mostalarming,.  The sketch Navy Estimates which the FirstLord has just submitted to mo are actually  200,000 morethan the Estimates for 1930 as originally presented; andhe has assured me that it is only with the utmostdifficulty that he has been able to get them down to that
  V        figure.   Thoy include  on  account  of New  Construction the           exceptionally low figure of  6,000,000  gross, which, if           a     shadow-cut is  applied, will  be reduced to  a net           expenditure of  5,-1-00,000.   But if the &quot;original&quot;           programme for 1931 and  the following years is approved,           the Treasury calculate  that the provision for New each case have        Construction In 1932 and. 1933  will exceed this figure bysuaed aadow-cut of approximately  2 million41  and   3 million? net respectively.k off theess         I can only  say that  I  seo  no moans,  short of additionaltlmatedpendituro.  taxation, of providing  the money.    It  is literally more than           wo  can afford.                (7)  I hold it  essential  therefore,  on  financial grounds,           that tho programme of Hew  Construction  before tho Committee           should be substantiall:/ reduced.   I propose that the           following items he omitted:                                                                                1  large  6&quot;  Cruiser .......    1,550,000                       2  Destroyers  .............     700,000                       2  Sloops   ......,........     275,000                                                     2,525,000                    Tho effect  of  this will be  to  restore the  position           to what it  would have been if  the  &quot;amended&quot;  programme had           beon in force throughout,  but  with this advantage,  that  we           shall meanwhile have succeeded, as we intended,  in  avoiding           an excessive dislocation of labour in the dockyards through           too sudden  a drop In the  programme  in  1931.   Ky advisers           calculate that the provision for New Construction in the 4           years 1930r-3 undor my proposal (A) will compare  as  follows,           with the &quot;original&apos;1  programme  (B)  (after  a 10^ shadow-cut in           each case):                       1930         1931         1932       1933                                                                            A.  6,152,909    5,409,851  6,610,653   6,578,708                B.  6,132.909    5,412,911  7,527,899   8,379,383
9 *? 9 o&apos; w    (8) As  regards  the  employment  aspect  of  the matter,on  which the First Lord lays  stress  in his  supplementary Memor-andum of the 19th January  (F. S. (29)4.1),  it  might beinferred from his remarks  that  approval  of  the proposalsnow before  the Committee is necessary in order to avoidheavy discharges from  the  Dockyards  in the  near future. ButI am not satisfied that that  is the  case.   As he himself pointsout, the 19 31 Programme will  scarcely affect expenditure in thefinancial year 1931 at  all.   As for  the  year 1932, it will be clear from  the figures  I have just given that, unless the 1931Programme were cut down far more  drastically than I have proposed,  the expenditure  on  New  Construction from April 1st1932 onwards will certainly be  higher than  it was either in1930 or 1931.  If therefore,  in dealing  with this employ-merit aspect of the problem, our object is to avoid heavydischarges  in the Yards, there  appears to be no need to go beyond my proposals.  If it is one of our objects to try&quot;to stabilise our expenditure, and  therewith the rate of employment,I suggest&apos;  that my proposals are to be preferred, for they aim at  a steady level of expenditure  over the next few years in theneighbourhood of  6-g- million  net,  whereas the First Lord&apos;sproposals appear to result in a variation of  1 million between19 32 and 19 33, following on a jump of nearly  2 millionsbetween 1931 and 1932.   Some  variation between 1931 and 19 32 is inevitable, but it need not be  as large  as  this.  I cannotadmit that  the Government  is  under any obligation to incursuch heavy  increase of  expenditure in order to provide acorresponding increase  of  (Employment either in the RoyalYards or in the shipbuilding  industry^        I hold therefore that the necessities of theemployment  side of the  question are  sufficiently met by my proposals.                         -4-
,(5 *v *&quot;)iO  $     (9)  There remains the  question whether&apos; by-adoptingmy proposals we are not falling  below  the  standard  set bythe London IT aval Treaty.   To  this  I answer  (a) that I amonly going back to the programme which the First Lord himself was prepared to accept 8 months  ago, when  our financial difficulties were far less serious  than they are now;   (b)that in any case I regard the  London Naval Treaty figures  asmaxima up to which we are permitted to build if we  wish, not as minima which we must adhere to at all costs;  and  (c)that if we adopt my proposal,  and continue to lay down2 cruisers a year between now  and 1936, we shall still have50 cruisers under 20 years of  age built and building,  onDecember 31st, 1936.   I am  not  convinced that  we need have more -(Intld.)    P.  S.Treasury Chambers, 31.    January 23rd, 1931.
