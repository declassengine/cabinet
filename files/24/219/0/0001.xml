PANEL OF MINISTERS ON UNEMPLOYMENT.

NOTES ON THE PROBLEMS OF THE DEPRESSED AREAS.

Introductory Note by the Secretariat.

At the last meeting of the Panel of Ministers for Unemployment the Prime Minister raised the question of Government policy in regard to the permanent surplus of labour in the depressed areas. The problems presented by the areas have been under consideration by the Departments more directly concerned and the annexed memoranda dealing with separate aspects of the problem have been approved respectively by the Minister of Health, the Minister of Labour, and the President of the Board of Trade. The Minister of Health deals with problems of local government which have arisen or may arise in the depressed areas, the Minister of Labour discusses the labour position, and the President of the Board of Trade examines the problem of attracting new industrial development.

It will be seen from the memorandum of the Minister of Health that from the standpoint merely of local government, the difficulties are less acute than might have been expected. The problems which would arise were an area to become derelict would be in the main financial in character. But notwithstanding the decline in prosperity in the areas now classed as necessitous the services have generally been well maintained and the rating position has in the last few years definitely improved. Outstanding debts give some cause for apprehension though even in areas of special difficulty a beginning has been made in the matter of repayment.
The Minister - of Health, finds the explanation of this condition in the stepe that have &quot;bean taken by the Ministry aver tholast ton years and more directly in- the transfer under theLocal Government Act of last year of public assistance andof certain road chargce to the wider area cf. the County.          If any areas show sie-ns of further serious deterioration in tho near future tho &quot;Ministor of Healthsuggests that tho transfer of other services to thoCounties,, with special State assistance, will have to beconsidered %          The labour problem resolves itself ultimatelyinto one of.absorbing into employment the workers who arenow or who will become surplus to the requirements of localindustrios.   The Minister of Labour finds  it impossible to frame any estimato of the extent or the precise distributionof tjhis surplus.  . Hot only have its limits been obscuredby thve wide general unemployment that has prevailed duringthe last eighteen months but it is  too  early yet tot say what will be the ultimate position In the cotton industry inLancashire or in tho coal industry  when the Coal Mines act of this &quot;year is in effective operation.          It is the Minister of Labour Ts object to creatoin thoso areas whore the. surplus is to  be found, the will to work and a recognition, where there  is no prospect of alternative -(Employment, ef the necessity of seeking workelsewhere..   Maintenance of the machinery and technique of long range placing is necessarily involved  if immediateadvantage is to bo taken of a revival  in world ,trade aotivity.          Juveniles and women present  special problems andthese are being tacklec through the Ministry^  juniorinstruction and home training centres.          Though as the President of the Trade  of Trfidepoints  out, the k fate of ..the depressed  areas is bound up with
the future- of the heavy&quot; lndu.strrie s,  the  davol &quot;pnenrir--in- &quot;th&amp;wareas of the-smaller  industries would,  if  economically sound.  (!-:                                                               iffee cf general advantage.    Manufacturers engaged  ca new industrial development  have however  shown  a markedpreference for  the  Southern counties and i,n his  note thoPresident reviews  tho factors which  have opcratod in establishing this  preference.  Many ef tho depressed areas - notably the ccal  mining valleys, in South. &quot;Wales -are- quite unsuitable  for  any  other industry; &apos;-  many offerwhat is thought to  be an  impeverishjed ooivsu ing: mayjfcpt:with the increase  in  the  uso  of alectrioal motive powerithe Worth has lost one  nf tho advantages  it  enjoyeo.  overthe South:  private reserves  of- capital in the  depressedaroas have been depleted,,:   labour  in  tho  South Is moro-flexible than in Lancashire and the  Worth.    finally,          jgreater enterprise hsa  been shown  in the  South,  than else wherein tho provision of suitable  factories for the  smallerindustrlas.          The problem  of attracting new industrial enterpriseto-the dopressed areas, despite their  formidable drawbacks,is daow being carefully  &amp;xaminea in  tha light of past         /exparienoo, and tho President  indioatas at  the  end of hisnote the lines &quot;along \ifoioh  examination is proceeding.16th December, 1930.
                            LOCAL  GOVERNMENT  PROBLEMS,             - . ,  *  t OTB BY THE             The  responsibility  of  the  Ministry  is  in  regard  toHNISTEH 01?IBALTH.      general  local  government  of areas  likely  to become  derelict            and  does not,  of course,  extend  to Industrial neasures.   They            have been dealing with  neoessitous areas, for  the last  ten            years,  and tho measures which they have  taken have  avoided            tho  serious trouble  in  the  sphoro  of local  government  which            mus t o th o forwarding s e havo  o c ourred.                       The  local  government problems  may be--considered            under three heads -  (1) the maintenance  of  services;             (2)  the  revenuo (or  rates)  position; (3)  the  debt position;            in addition (4) some  brief&apos; notes are appended on a  few            places  of special difficulty, and  (5) cn possible measures            If aroas become genuinely dereliot.                                (1)  Services.                       Some&apos; services have  not been at so high a  level as            If the  areas had been prosperous,  but generally they have            boen Mrly well maintainou. and there is no  evidence of any            general  deterioration of  health,   Special  enquiry  was made            into this point two  yea.rs ago and is being  repeated at            present.   Many things could  no  doubt ha-ve  been done if means            had  been plentiful,  but the uistrieta on the  whole  have not             done badly.                       They will  be helped by the 100$ grant for            necessitous areas, end in this connection it  is instructive             (a)  that of the  440,000  allocated to England and Wales, no             less than  308,000 has been already allotted  to areas in             South Wales and Monmouthshire,  (b) that no  cotton town made             a definite application for the 100$ grant (the intense             depression in the cotton trade is, of course, of comparatively                                     - 4-                          .
10recent date), and. (c) that there was net a  plvtitudo ofsuitable schemes for the grant.   (A list if the Authoritiesto which the lOOfo grant has been distributed is given inappendix 1) ,          If the areas, or some of them, go steadily down-hillit will, of course, bo more difficult to maintain local services at a decent standard.   But the Local government act of last year has Uelpcd, especially by the transfer ofpublic assistance and of the cost of class 1 and class 11rsads from localities to the wider area cf the,county.                (2) Kates.          The position, of most of the difficult areas has)au*h improved during th** last  faw ypares, owing partly(until recently) to better industrial conditions, partly to higher assessments,  partly  (but only sinoe April, 1930)to the operation of the Locnl  Government Act of 1929, andnot least to the efforts of tho Councils themselves, underpressure from the Ministry..    Rates have been  lowered andoverdrafts for revenue  purposes reduced, in several  caseswiped out.          In assessing  tho significance of high rates in areas which have long been depressed, account  has to betaken of tho fact that  property values  (and thereforeassessments) in such areas aro probably well below  thosein more prosperous plaees.          Tho following summary  indicates  progress;more details will be found  in  appendix  11  :-

These results have been attained on the basis  afthe principle that the localities ^ught  to help  themselvesto the utmost extent in their pocvBr,  and it has  been found
as a general rule that they accept the principle, and do their &quot;best to carry it cut, when thay Kodlico that self-helpmust c6me first0          Appendix II also gives information of  the ratesin a few cctton towns to show the lewer general  level than in mining towns, especially in South Vales.   The difference oflevels nay &quot;be attributed (a) to the more thrifty publichabits of tho cotton towns, (b) to the difficult topographicalconditions of many mining areas, (c) in some case.&apos;- to thehigh cost of comparatively recent public works,   thconsequent heavy lean chargese     The Local Government Act of last year will  isethe position of &quot;derelict&quot;&apos;&apos; areas, net only bee.    some heavy-charges will be borne by the wider area of the county insteadof the locality, but also because the Exchequer  grants willbe distributed to the localities at. so much per  person^regardless of rateable value                   (3) Debts.          Local debts maybe divided, into three  main groups,according as they have been incurred (a) for non-trading services net expressly grant-aided, (b) for non-trading services expressly grant-aided, and (c). for trading services.          As regards (b) - (l) the services may  vary frem&quot;Addison&quot; housing, where the only direct charge  on the locality is a penny rate, to schools, where about 20%  ;  -(increased to 50&apos;,-i iM respect of educational reorganisationschemes carried proportionate under the present Government&apos;s programme)of the loan charges is met from grants; (2) many schemes which, wsjild normally come und- r (a) have been brought under
 (b) by unemployment  grants;  (s)  the  grants for some loan services  (such  as  sanatoria) have been merged in  the general Exchequer grant0           As regards (c),  trading  services - (l)  in seme of  the mining areas  in particular  it has always been the practice  to levy some charge on  the  rates (partly in order- to  get a  contribution out  of the coilieriesj but  in some areas  (Merthyr  is  a  notorious  instance) the cost  of an under-talcing has been extraordinarily heavy) ; *\2)  important in  estimating the  position ef  &quot;derelict areas, the return from&apos; trading services depends  en the prosperity ef the district          Particulars are  given  in appendix II of the debts  of  a number  of the v/orst mining and cetton  towns.   It will be seen that  the debt position  would be serious if the places becpjne  derelict.           It has been the  policy of  the Ministry  in recent years  to  obtain County rather  than District capital expenditure, but,  in accordance with the policy ef the Government, no  obstacle has been put in the way of District works, but &apos;Some areas find it  difficult to raise  the necessary capital.                (4) Areas of Special  Difficulty.          Merthyr  Tydfil (population 79,5C0, rateable value  244,000, rates 25s.  8d.)  - One ^cf the most difficult areasbecause of its  size  and because it is a County Borough and, therefore, not  able  to spread  some of its burdens on the County.   At present, position especially difficult because in addition  to its depressed  coal mining. Guest Keen works closed down.   A very high  education expenditure, attributed by theBoard  of Education/                        -  G -
to the scattered nature of the district and the old-fashionedschools, also a large rate deficit for water supply, becauseof heavy cost of scheme (sanctioned by Parliament; most of itcarried out at high post-war prices).          Rhondda  (population 154,000; rateable value  448,656;rates 23soOd.) - The second largest Urban District in the countryin population.   The Council&apos;s difficulties have been greatlyincreased by the liquidation of Colliery Companies.  They arean Elementary Education Authority.   They have a heavy bankoverdraft and are indebted to the Ministry for a revenue loan;the block grant is helping them to repay both overdraft and loan.          Brynmawr (population 7,878; rateable value  18,875;rates 23s.6d.) - As an industrial area, this place is derelict,but It serves as a dormitory for nearby mining atfeas and is a market town in a small way.   The Council have a heavy bankoverdraft, which to some extent is the result of an epidemic ofsmallpox 3 years ago; it is gradually being reduced.  The block grant is helping the Council to improve their financial position.The Council is not an Elementary Education Authority. Unfortunatelythere is little likelihood of Brynmawr being linked up withother areas under the general review of County Districts in process under the Local Government Act, 1929.          Nantyglo and Blaina (population 15,200; rateable value  32,000; rates 25s.Od.)  - One of- the worst areas; ironand steel works long ago abandoned; 7 out of 8 pits closedpermanently and unemployment very severe.  Large sums for the size of the area have been lent to the Council by the ministry for revenue deficits.  Very little repayment has hitherto beenmade; but the Council have been specially/
 fortunate in the amount of the block grant  and  this  is enabling them to start to pay off those  loans and also  the arrears cf precepts     afar, the County Council,    Severe economies have been adopted.    The Council  is not an   .  &apos; Elementary Education,Authority0    It is  understood that the. County Council mey prcpose to amalgamate -tfeas district  with Abertillery to form one Urban District,,                  - -           Abgrtillgry, (pspulation 32^*840; rateable value  111,414;  rates 26s..2d,)  - This Council  gave a  great deal of  trouble in the  past, and their failure in collecting rates  led to the appointment  of a strong Committee (the &quot;Big Three&quot;)V   Since that time there  has been  no  reason to  complain,,    The Council are an elementary Education Authority;  the question of surrendering  their autonomy came up  acutely in 192.7, but  no  change was  made.           Ebbw Vale  (population 33,650; rateable  value  10-5,791 rates  19so0d.)  - This district is dependent on the Ebbw CVa^e Steel,  Iron and Coal Company  who,  after  a long period of financial  difficulties  (they  paid no rates  for 18*months but are  now paying the  arrears by instalments) closed down the greater part of their  steel  works 8  months agoe                - (5)  Measures.           Experience shown that  it is a  mistake (a)  to  jump to  the conclusion because  of  industrial  difficulties              areas that generally/are  suddenly  going to become derelict- (they.have  a remarkable ability  to hang  on, even  if  in gradual  decay,  and,  in  some instances, of recuperating), (b) to render  aid  too readily because otherwise the localbodies are  apt not  to do as much as  they can under-duress, and dlfficult-Ie $ may be increased  in the long run.
           If  areas  are becoming derelict, it would be well to-: consider pressure  for  transferring  some  services to the County..    Merthyr,  for instance, would be better placed if  it  ceased  to be  a  County Borougho   Some of the larger                    -  &apos;be Urban  Districts might/better  if their  education work and  charges were  transferred  to the County.   Some of the smaller Urban Districts might be better merged in Eural Districts,,           But it  would be* Utopian to expect the County Councils to undertake burdens without  compensation.   There would be a demand f$r a special State  subsidy, and, in the last resort,  it is  a  remedy which would probably have to be considered.   Already the&quot; burden of the aged has been spread either on  the  State (through pensions)  or (except for County Boroughs)  on the County (through public assistance) ,  and  this is  important for &quot;&quot;derelict&quot; areas where the proportion  of aged may be expected steadily tobecame higher9

hi JTHE GENERAL LABOUR PROBLTiM*mm BY THEnfasTss. op^oi jr.      The experience of the last two years has confirmed the analysis sat out in the Report of the Industrial Transference Board, 1923.  The fundamental point to which they drew attention was the difference in character of the unemployment in certain localities in which the heavy industries, and particularly coaly predominated, as compared with other parts of tho country, especially the midlands and tho south.  The changes which have taken place since then may &quot;be briefly surrtmarice&quot;d as f oilrws ; - (l)   The rise in the general level of unemployment,  extending to practically every industry and locality^ now masks this fundamental difference.   There are places and trades, which up to two years ago had had a relatively small experience of unemployment, which now can show,  for the time being, almost as high a percentage as some of the worst mining areas. (2)  It follows that the policy of draining ^ff the surplus population from the waterlogged areas is for tho tjme being far  loss practicable. (3)   The passing of the Coal Mines Aot,  1950 has altered the position,  temporarily at any rate. In a  manner which will ha explained below. (-1)   In the Lancashire  cotton areas the  position has changed. for  the worse.   This alsc is referred to in greater  detail below. (5)   is.  substantial  number&apos; of persons have been removed by the-Ministry- of Labour  or by their own efforts from the  depressed mining  areas to  pia^e-S-vvfee-r8- they  can even now get some employment  and where they will  bo  able to share  on a t least equal terms in any  revival  of employment.   Though a  number of these -  probably  as many as one-third have  returned
to their hone districts, undoubted advantages have accruedin addition to the permanent removal of a substantial number;namely (a) the creation in the depressed areas of a will tomove and of a recognition that employment must sooner or later be sought elsewhere., and (b) the establishment by theMinistry of Labour of a machinery and technique of long-range placing which should be invaluable, when trade revives,in helping to overcome the immobility of labour.(6)   Assisted overseas migration has practically ceasedand shows no sign of revival in the near future.     As regards coal mining the immediate net effect of the quota system is to stabilise the present position..   Thepossible benefits from amalgamation can only accrue slowly.To begin with, there will no doubt be a disposition for theweaker pits to carry on with their present quotao   As theydiscover that the best they can hope for is below theminimum level of prosperity, transfer of quotas andamalgamation will no doubt follow, but the inherent difficultiesof the process, even apart from other less y/wellworthy reasons,must make progress slowa   This means that it is not atpresent possible to estimate either what is the overallsurplus in the industry, or which particular1 pits arelikely to be closed and which localities in consequencesapart from those already scheduled, may require special treatment.     As regards measures of assistance to depressed miningarteas, the anxious deliberations of the 1... st two years havethrown up no new expediente   A great deal is being done byway of temporary relief work.   The position as regardsthe introduction of new industries is dealt with in a
 separate note;  it should only be observed here that there is little hope of  assistance by this means to such areas as the                 ;V&quot;      O Rhond&amp;a,  most parts of Lanarkshire or some of the most hardly hit mining villages in the Forth East-   Evevy sound economic and. geographical reason is against the starting of  tie., industries in such placer; as the  elsh mining valleys. Transfer has inevitably slced loan,  both because of the rise  in &quot;die general level of unemployment and because of the abandonment of  grants for public -..orks conditional upon transfer.   The  Ministry of Labour are still giving a sub- stantial  preference for hdmiscion to  their training centres to  youths from  the  depressed mining areas, and the Minister recently decided to increase the training accommodation. Even  here,  ho. ever,  much greater&apos; difficulty is being experienced in  securing those effective pla.cin.-zs at the end of training without \.hich the  training scheme must collapse.   On the other hand,  it is probably true that distress  is less acutely felt in the  mining areas this winter than in  previous winters,  partly because of the alterations in  the  conditions for  unemployment benefit madeby  the  193$  Act,  partly also because  people have settled down to  a  lover  level  of  income and have accommodated themselves to  it-   There are Junior Instruction  Centres or Classes within reach of  practically all juvenile;-.&apos;, in the  depressed mining areas.  Home Training Centres for  v-.or.en and girls have been increased in number  and are  working^ successfully.   The proposed stimulation of  allotments  will certainly be helpful.      In Lancashire  the  position  has changed for the  -worse,but it has  not  yet  clarified itself sufficiently to  make  anyprecise estimate  of  the  fixture unevn.ploymeut problem  possible:&quot;It  is  clear  that  no  conceivable  revival .of trade  or  reorganisa- tioh  will absorb  anything  like all  the  employees  who  at presentare attached, to the  cotton industry..  An  exhaustive  analysis
&quot;fey -the- l&amp;Lnl&amp;try  of Labour led  to  a  guess  that  the  surpluswould he not less than 100,000 men  and women,  &quot;but  this isonly a guess and cannot be  quoted with any  safety, even ifit were desirable that under present  conditions any estimateshould be given.  It is clear, however, that there will &quot;tee a surplus and that there must be deep-seated  changes in thesooial life of the cotton eperatives.  Hitherto, the familyhas been the industrial unit.  It seem certain that marriedwomen will in future be employed  much less  than in the past.The changes on the weaving  side in  the direction of a multipleloom organisation are likely to result In the  employment ifmen in a larger  proportion  than in  the past, with earningspossibly higher  than those  of  the men alone in the past, &quot;but probably also less than the combined  earnings  in good timesfff the man and his wife.    The opposition of the operativesto this change can only retard but  cannot ultimatelyprevent it.     The chief praotical problems of  unemployment which will arise appear to  ber-     (a) The question of dealing  with a certain number&apos;     pf families which are  rendered entirely surplus to     the industry&apos;s requirements^     (&quot;b) The possibility of finding employment locally in     &amp;ew Industries for them and  for  married women in so far     as the ear*\iiriss of their  husbands sr sons are insufficient     (o) The position of juveniles.     As regaivds  juveniles in Lancashire the Ministry **fLabour have Recently &quot;been carrying  out detailed enquiriesin wpcler to try  and arrive  at  a correct appreciation of theposition,.  It is estimated  that on  the basis of tnade as itwas in May, 19oQ the total  supply of  beys in Lancashire was
inot more  than  sufficient  for  the  jrct-^-ti^e needs of theindustry. There was, however, much local mal-distrlbution; that isto say, there  were  considerable surpluses in some areas and deficitsin others.  The arrangements  for  &quot;Choice of Employment&quot; in Lanca-shire are to a larger  extent  than elsewhere in  the hands of theLocal Education Authorities,  whose areas are small and outlookparochial.  With  the help of  one  or  two of the  bigger Authorities,such as Lancashire  County Council, which have wider vision, theMinistry of Labour  are doing  their best to build up machineryfor securing a greater mobility of boy labour.  It is probable thatthis can only  be  achieved by  quiet pressure and persistent effortover a considerable period; the local authorities in Lancashire areeven less amenable  than elsewhere to public exhortation from outside.     As regards girls, there  is,  on  economic merits, a very strong case for stimulating a larger flow to domestic  service, for whichthere is, even locally, a big unsatisfied demand.   The Minister ofLabour is taking  active steps to  this end by providing additionaltraining facilities and by trying to enlist the active co-operationof local informed opinion.     It is not yet  possible to say in Lancashire where precisely thesurplus will be or  what its local dimensions will be.  It is pro-bable that the problem will be more  acute on the spinning side thanon the weaving and  at the American end of the trade than at theEgyptian.     Liverpool presents a  special problem of, its own.   During theearly part of  this  year,  at the instance of the last Lord Mayor,  a careful investigation was  carried out of the methods of engagementof Labour in Liverpool.  The  report, which has been published,brings out more nakedly than  has  ever been done before the wide-spread extent  of  the &quot;stand&quot;  system in Liverpool and the strengthof local support  for its  continuance and the degree to which theemployment/                          -19-
 of labour on Merseyside is on a purely casual  basis.   It is primarily a problem for Liverpool employers and operatives themselves to deal v/ith, and they arc &quot;being urged to  apply themselves to it.  . It is a problem which exists in all ports in some measure, but  the evil feature in Liverpool is its wide  extension to  other trades and its deep roots. Decasualiza- tion,  if it. can be carried out,  will  throw up  a large surplus of labour,  much of which is of poor industrial quality.      To sum up:-      In coal-mining generally it is not possible yet  to forecast the effect of the 193C  Act upon the volume or distribution of employment.   It is net likely  to alter the position in the areas already recognized as the most  depressed; it may add others.      In Lancashire the future is still too undefined  to  make transfer an immediately practicable objective.   While it will be needed,  th?i extent of the need is at  present uncertain.   It is here  in particular that the possibilities of new industries are most  worth  exploring  and it is  in connection v/ith Lancashire that  this possibility is being  most cleseiy studied..     All  that  appears possible  at present is to &quot;carry on&quot;;. but it would be a  mistake to  under-estimate the value of what is beinp;  don^     Maintenance is being effectively provided through the Unemployment Insurance scheme and the Public Assistance Committees;  relief  works have &quot;been stimulated  to  a greater extent than at  any  previous  ti.ee;.  junior instruction centres or  classes  are  within reach of  practically all  unemployed juveniles;-   the younger  men who  are suitable for  some  form  of training  arc receiving preference  for admission to  theMinistry  of  Labour&quot;s  adult  training centres; home  training  centres
for women and girls have &quot;been established in increased, numbers;the promised increase in allotments will be a useful palliative.The net effect of all these efforts, though not equal to the magnitude of the problem, is nevertheless considerable, andas soon as industry in other areas shows signs of recovery fromthe present depression, the value of having attempted to maintainthe will to work in these depressed areas will booome apparent.
POSSIBILITIES OP WM INDUSTRIAL &apos;DLVJfiLOPMiKT,:he  Problem.S BY THEJSIDENT OP BOARD OPBE.1.      The first step in examining the possibilitiesof new industrial development in the depressed areas is toascertain the causes which are restricting new develop-ments in these areas from inside and are deterring thoseoutside who may have new projects in mind from carryingthem out in a depressed area   Tho causes are complexbut in the various explanations given of the neglect ofthe alder industrial areas in favour of such areas asSloughs Vfillesdenj, Lutoii, Bedford, Watford, some or all ofthe following points are usually advanced:-   (a)  Many places in the depressed areas and in some parts whole districts, particular^ those whose prosperityin the past has been based mainly on coal, are almosthopelessly unsuitable from an economic point of view forany other industry.   This point is stressed particularlyin reference to the valleys  of South Y/ales and the remoterdistricts of the North East  Coast area.   (b)  The depressed areas  have become impoverished asconsuming markets or at least the impression is abroad.that they are impoverished,.   London, on the other handsthe greatest concentrated consuming market in Great Britain,has been relatively unaffected by the depression in the basic industries.   It is natural, therefore, that the.newer Industriess which are  largely producing consumers&apos;goods-mainly for the home market, should establish them-selves near this expanding market and so avoid unnecessarytransport charges.   Both the import and export facilities of the London area are excellent,,...................,
   (c)  The North has no advantages jver the South when, asin the case of the smaller industries? there is no longer anydependence upon coal for fuel and electric power is all thatis required as a motive force,   Nor is there much advantageon the side of the North in the matter of site values0   (d)  The long depression in the North has depleted privatereserves of capital and persons who still have resources withwhich they are prepared to embark on new industrial enterprisesare now to be found in the South rather than in the NortiuThe natural tendency of such people is to favour development inan accessible area with which they are familiar rather than develop-ment in areas which seom to be under a cloud of depression and ofwhich they have little intimate personal knowledge,,.   (e)  Labour in the South has the reputation of being mere    &apos;amenable and more adapt able to new prcceasesc   Employers are..hesitant of embarking on a nev/ and perhaps experimental enterprisein an area where they fear; justly or unjustly, that they will -be hampered at every step by rigid Trade Union practice.   This point&apos;&apos;has been raised recently with special reference to Lancashire,, andthe difficulties now being experienced in securing agreement enthe working of a greater number of looms by a weaver will no doubttend to strengthen the prejudice against &quot;Uhe area,r   (f)  The amenities cf life in Southern England are greaterthan in the older industrial areas from the point of view of bothworkers and employers.   (g)  There has been greater enterprise&apos; in the South in developing industrial estates and in providing factories equipped with pswer and. light suitable for the . smaller industries, e0 g. atSlough- and Acton,, than in the North.                           -2.      In considering the weight to be attached&apos;.to these factorscare must be taken to differentiate between the various types of                      - -  -     -23-
depressed, area,,   These range from the mining village in aWelsh valley, dependent on a single coal pit, through wholedistricts dependent on a single industry such as the Rhondda,te areas such as Lancashire and towns such as Middlesboroughand Sheffield where, although thero is a predominant industry or industries suffering from extreme depression industrial lifeeither in some &quot;branches of the basic trades themselves or inother trades is still active,.   The decline of some of thesmaller villages and towns dependent solely on coal is in-inevitable.   There is nothing now or abnormal in this process,,No imaginable inducement will he sufficient to attract new industry tc them.   At the other end of the scale are districts and towns which, however severe the depressions will continueto have a strong industrial vitality,,   Lancashire, parts ofthe North East Coast area, and Sheffield are examples.,   Broadlyit is true to say that the fate of the depressed areas is bound up with the future  cf the heavy industries, coal, cotton, ironand steel? shipbuilding and heavy engineering.   A developmentof the smaller industries can at best be only a makeweight forsome years in such  areaso3,      Whatever view may be held as to the weight to beattached to any  or  all of the various factors said to be de-terring new enterprise in the depressed areas3 it is  an un-doubted fact that in many of tho cider industrial areas ofthe country there has been for  some  considerable time completestagnation in  the field of new  development, while concurrentlythere has been a remarkable  expansion in the  South of Englandaround London,   The inference  is that the  depressing forces atwork  are  of  great  strength  and  persistence  and the problem isto discover ways and means of counteracting them, based possibly
39on- the creation of a sentiment  of public duty ox1 on  substantialmaterial inducements or  on a combination of both-.                 B*  LI e* sure a ut ak on J.n Jb2ie- pjx st^4.      This problem was examined under the late Lord Privy Sealwith special reference to areas affected by the depression in thecoal trade.    It was then considered mainly from the point of-view of possible  .premiums&apos; to  be offered  to industry through theLocal Authorities and Pub &quot;Lie Services in the depressed areas,i. e. by further rate remissionoi by subsidies towards costs of light, heat and power;   by transport subsidiesc   The possibilitywas also considered of giving help to local authorities  in thedepressed areas to advertise on an organised basis the advantagesoffered by their areas for new  industrial  development.   In thisconnection contact was establj.sh.ed with a  number of  localauthorities, eg. Hull,  which had formed local development or-organisations to advertise the attractions of their areas.Contact was also established with the railway companies  who navehad experience on a large scale of inducing manufacturers totake up sites which the  railways had opened up.5o      Ho real progress was made along these lines.        The premiums considered were held  to be open to  so manyobjections and to raise  such cbiffica.lt questionss o. g. in conn.ee-tion with local government administration, and moreover  were thought likely to be so  ineffective in practice that it  wasdecided not to attempt to carry out a scheme based upon  them butto await an opportunity - of considering the matter when someindustrial undertaking actually declared its readiness toestablish itself in one  of the  depressed areas.   Ho serious-approach was made by any such undertakings
      As regards an organised.advertising campaignspossibly assisted by the State, on behalf of depressedareass it was felt on examination of various proposals that little practical result would come of it*    Allindustrial areas in the country from the most depressedto the most prosperous are anxious to attract new businessesand the most prosperous areas could probably make the most successful appealo   The campaigns which obviously couldnot be confined to the depressed areas in the narrow sense of the term, would probably only lead to a competitivescramble for publicitys local authorities shouting theirrespective claims one against anothers without any nationalbenefit,,   While unofficial blessing was given to theefforts of such authorities as Hull to attract new industriesno action was taken to organise a comprehensive publicity campaign on behalf of depressed areas.6.      A further class of difficulties arose out of thepossible use of State funds to provide the necessary induce-ment3*   It was generally agreed that if assistance fromState sources were to be a feature of any scheme  such assistance could  only be contemplated for an  industry whichwas not already carried on in  the particular  area within  ..which assistance  was to be given.   Otherwise it  vra.s feltthat  it would be  difficult to  withhold assistance towardsextension  of existing premises which  so we  should be foldswould close  or move  elsewhere  without  such  assistance?  er toavoid subsidising one  enterprise  at  the  expense  of another
in the same-area,.   It was of course recognised that eventhe limitation of assistance to new industries (in the sense of industries not already carried on in the-particular area)would he open to serious criticisms, e0g. prosperous firmsopening a new &quot;branch in a depressed area might obtainassistance while struggling industries in the area would receive nothing, and assistance might he given towards theestablishment of enterprises in an area for which prima faeiethey were not by nature fitted, while it would be refusedto a natural indigenous industry, but it was felt that ifany State assistance were to be given these-difficulties would at once arise,7.          &quot;While these difficulties were felt to stand in theway of any general scheme of State assistance to particular industries, a special examination (undertaken originallyfrom the point of view of the needs of national defenoe)was carried out into the possibilities of new industriesbased on the scientific treatment of coal and thereforespecially suitable for location in the coalmining areas.From this&apos; examination it appeared that the process most likely to show results which might lead to the establishmentof an entirely new national indtistry valuable both for defence and economic reasons was the production of oil by hydrogenation.Spocial consideration was given to the possibility ofestablishing this process on a commercial basis and activesteps in this direction are now proceeding,,    .  -r              Co   The lessons of past experience.         ?8a          The experience of the last eighteen months suggeststhat any approach to the problem of new industrial developments in depressed areas through local authorities will not beeffectiveo   Local Authorities would- enly bo prepared to offersubstantial financial inducements to the extent that they were
 assisted by the  State  to  do  so.   But if any State assistance to  lucal authorities,  to  asaist  them by way of  &apos;bribes&apos; to  attract  industrial  enterprises, were to be given it would be almost  impossible to  restrict the area of assistance sufficiently narrowly  to  make  the scheme effective in tackling the problem of the  really depressed areas.   It was at  one  time  thought that it  might be possible to restrict a scheme to areas  classed as depressed by the bihistry ofLabour  for  transfer purposes,  but it is higiTlv  doubtful whether it  would ever  have been  possible to restrict the scheme  in this way.    It  would for instance be  difficult to  admit the claim of  llerthyr  Tydfil and Oldham but to reject that nf Sheffield  or Newcastle.   Cities like Liverpool, hull, Glasgow, or  the  dockyard towns;  the tin  mining areas of  Cornwall; the  shale iil  areas of  cotland could all make out claims  to be included in any scheme.   Once the sc^po ef  the  scheme has  been widened to this extent it would obviously become something like  a scheme for assisting certain types of development in most of  toe older industrial areas of  the  country.    But  the only hope of achieving anything in this field  lies  in concentration of effort on particular areas. 9.          This  suggests  again that any scheme  devised to deal with  the problem  should be  on a wide industrial basis and if  on  an area  basis should be on a wider basis than would be  possible if an  approach were  to be made through individual local  authorities.  The  natural economic basis of an area is  not  confined  within the local government boundaries of the area.   A  nerrow parochial basis may indeed by  leading to futile  dispersion  of efforts be  positively dangerous.                 - -28-
10.          Further, study suggests&quot; that efforts to deal withthe problem mil only be successfu.1 in so far as all interestsin the depressed areas are prepared to give a warm welcome to new industrial enterprise and in so far as the enterprise tobe promoted is on a sound commercial basis.   The effectiveness of the welcome will depend upon the readiness of&quot;all sectionsof the population to adapt themselves to new ideas and new methods of working .   Given the necessary welcome, the successpf the enterprise itself will depend upon the possibilityof its being worked ultimately on an ordinary commercial basis, yielding an adequate return to those interested at its promotions   On no other basis will the necessary energy and initiative be forthcoming in present circumstances teovercome initial difficulties and to make the enterprise a success.   Local self-help and initiative must be thekeynotes of any effort to bring new industrial activities intothe depressed areas.                    D.   Present Action.11.          The whole problem is now being re-examined afresh,by the Chief Industrial Adviser in consultation withrepresentatives of business and financial interests.   Special&apos;attention is being paid to the possibilities of Lancashirewhere on the face of it tho discouraging factors are not so strong as in certain other depressed areas.   It must berecognised at once that there are natural forces at workencouraging development in the Couth and Midlands as againstthe N^rth or Scotland or South Wales.   Any attempt completelyto turn the stream of industrial development back into the older industrial areas is not only doomed to failure but j :-,probably fundamenta.Tly uneconomic.   But at the same timeparts of the depressed area.&apos; at airy rate, do appear to offersolid advantages to those who may be contemplating nev                        -29-  -
^industrial.-enterprises -  availability  of public -services,power,  light  and heat;  and  ample  supply - as in Lancsaahire -of  skilled  labour  (though it would be  unwise to minimise-the apprehensions, whether founded or  unfounded.? of employersabout the willingness and adaptability of organised labour in  these areas);   ample housing facilities in close proximity to  work;  close proximity, as in Lancashire and Yorkshire,to  enormous consuming markets,,   All these and other advantages  suggest that it may be  possible for parts ofthe depressed areas  to offer substantial attractions to thos^about to undertake new industrial  developments12.           The kind of  questions which must be studied as a preliminary to the effort to organise  attractions on such abasis as this nay be briefly indicated :-     (a)    Are there available in  e.gD Lancashire factorysites and premises which  could be  readily adapted and offered for disposal  at bargain prices to  provide facilities for small industries  analu-tGlts^o those provided by Slough?Could the depressed  industries, if they own zicfo premiseswhich have  become  redundant, interest  themselves in their disposal on attractive lines?     (b)    Could manufacturers in  depressed areas who haveunused  plant  and factory  space available, and still have s-smesurplus capital, be  induced  to consider embarking upon hewenterprises?    (Certain Lancashire firms are known to have considered  developments on such lines) 0     (c)    Could associations of -business and financial interests e.go banks, insurance companies, distributive trades, breweries,  transport undertakings, etc, wheseprosperity  depends on the general  health of the industrial life of the area,  be formed  for wide areas with a view to giving  publicity to  the advantages these areas offer for nevr
industrial development and to providing if necessary thematerial bribes which may be necessary to attract such development into the areas?          These questions indicate the lines along whichthe new enquiries into the general problem are proceeding.At the same tine$ as already indicated, active steps of aspecial uatarc are being taken to promote the &amp; c4;abl&apos;, :;hmenton a commercial basis of a new industry based on the productioof oil from coal.-31-
