roOTTMiSST  IS  TIUJ] FltOiExiTY OF ILLS EBITANlfIC MAJESTY1S G0YERKM3SNT)CHE Tt- 19(31) .COPY NO.0 A B ISTJGAH  BEST.Memorandum by the Chancellor  of  the Axchecuer.       The memorandum by  the Minister of Agriculture proposing additional aid  to the; Sugar Beet industry is open to very strong objection from the point of view of the Treasury on the following grounds.       1.  The  large  prospective Budget deficit for 1931 precludes an additional commitment of  600,000, as proposed by the Ministry, or  1,500,000 (approx.)  as proposed by the factories.There is no money for the purpose,       2.  The  existing subsidy has placed, the Sugar Beet Companies in a favoured position, and has been  severely criticised in many quarters.-    The Companies have  done  very well out of the subsidy.*    The fact that the  acreage under Beet has grown from 178,000 in 1928  to 348,000 in 1930 shows that the growers also have done  well in recent years.     There will be an                                                        s . outcry if the statutory reduction of  the subsidy from 13/-   s. d.     -                                          &quot; -- to 6/6 per owt- as from next  September is  mitigated, as proposed, in any way, on  account of.the temporary slump in prices.   Had prices risen, the taxpayer would have received no consideration.*  Only one shows a deficit.  . Bight  of them  have  paid dividends,mostly&apos; tax-free, averaging 10$ over the period  since theystarted, and have written off all their preliminary  expenses,  and,after setting aside an average of 8$  per annum  for depreciation,had accumulated a total surplus at 31st March last cf  1,400,000,covering on the average 50$ of their  paid up  share capital,(A total of nearly  1,300,000 has definitely  been  set asideas Reserves),
i 0,9A. ij O       3c  Lany trades.jare now  suffering from, low prices.  TJxeSugar Beet industry must, like  cotton and  other  industries,be left to rationalise itself and adjust itself  to  the marketwithout special State aid to meet the price  situation.    Thefact that the Sugar Beet trade, unlike other trades,  is  alreadysubsidised by the State is an additional argument  againstnew State grants now, not an argument for  them.       4.  If the State now refuses definitely to  help theBeet Companies in what they say is a temporary difficulty forone year, the factories and the  farmers will have  to come to terms without additional help,  as the only alternative to throwing away all the capital invested  in the industry.If necessary., a few of the least experienced factories must  be closed temporarily (unless the  farmers who supply  them areprepared to help them by growing at a loss for a short period,as a number of Continental farmers do, for the sake of thespecial value of the beet as a  fertiliser) or amalgamated withsome of the efficient factories, which might carry  them  on fora while with the-aid of their large reserves.       5.   The Companies have  already received  two windfallsfrom the State since 1925, viz:  firstly, a net reduction inthe Excise duty on sugar, owing to Budget  changes,  and,secondly,relief from rates, consequent on the Local  Government Act, 1929.A third concession now is open  to the strongest  objections.       6.   The general difficulties of cereal farmers must  beconsidered in connection with the proposed Wheat Quota Bill,.andnot regarded as a reason for State intervention  between farmers and factories in the fixing of  sugar beet  prices,  or for anincrease in the Sugar Beet subsidy.
       7.  No furthejr  conc-cauion can now te made to thecompanies without legislation.     They demand a firm promise of aid without delay.    This rraans immediate legislation to amend the Subsidy Act of 1925;    and the prospect ofcarrying such a measure in the  early weeks of the present session must be remote-, even if the policy had beenacceptable.
