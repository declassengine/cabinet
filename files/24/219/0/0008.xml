9 9o hiFIRST  REPORT.I. INTRODUCTORY.(a)  Composition and Terms of Reference.   AT their Seventh Meeting (E.A.C./7th Meeting, conclusion (a)),the Economic Advisory Council appointed a Committee with thefollowing terms of reference       To prepare an appreciation  of the Chinese situation and to   submit recommendations as to possible steps that could be taken   to develop British trade in the  Far East.   2.  The  Committee is  composed as follows :       The Bight Hon. William Graham, M.P., President of the          Board of Trade  (Chairman).      Sir Charles S. Addis, K.C.M.G.      Sir Arthur Balfom. Bt...  K.B.E.      M:r. &quot;Tugh Balton,  M.P.,  Parliamentary Under-Secretary of                Foreign  Office.      Mr. J. M. Keynes, C.B.      Mr. Archibald Bose, C.I.E.(b) Comparison of British Trade in China in 1913 and at the Present                            Time.   3.  During the last  fifty years there has  been a continuousdecline in the value of goods imported into China from the UnitedKingdom,  From figures furnished by  the Department of  OverseasTrade, which we  attach as an Appendix  (Table I), it  appears thatthe value of such goods is to-day about one-half of  what it was in1913, and that the decline  in  value has been  steady  since 1922.This  decline   is  mainly  due  to  the development  of  export industries  in  other  countries  trading  with  China,  and in this development  the  increase in Japanese exports of cotton-goods to china is  of special importance (Appendix, Table  II).  The difficulties experienced by British exporters during the. war in maintaining their trade connections and goodwill in  China, and the high costof production  in  this  country  in the  post-war  period, have alsobeen contributory causes of the decrease  in our  share of the  trade.On the other hand, the share of the United States is to-day almostthree times what it was in 1913, and in volume is double that of theUnited Kingdom  (Appendix, Table I); while Germany,  excludedfrom the  China market during the war,  has  already regained herpre-war share.    The  position of Hong Kong  in relation to thetrade  of  China, has  become  less important than it was in 1913.It has been supplanted by Japan, which is now the largest supplierto China (Appendix,  Table I).   Throughout the post-war  periodJapan has maintained fairly steadily her  share of the  China  trade,which is  now three times as great in value as  that of the UnitedKingdom.Mr.  A.  F.

II.-POSSIBLE METHODS OF ASSISTING BRITISH TRADE                         IN CHINA.                      (a)  Credit Facilities.   4.   In approaching our task  we considered whether we couldsubmit any suggestions for  improving British methods  of tradewith China, or recommend any steps which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment could take to assist the competitive power of British merchantsin that market. Although some important manufacturing companies have opened their  own branches  and have  traded  direct,  a sub-stantial part of the British trade in China is still in the hands ofa  large  number  of  merchant  firms  and  companies  of  long experience.  Though  it may be true that in some  directions thepolicy  they  have  pursued has been on the conservative side, andthat the volume  of their  trade  could  be  increased by improvedsalesmanship  and  by  adaptation  of  methods to  meet  modernChinese requirements,  we have not ourselves  the material to enable us to form  a  considered judgment on this question.   Nor do wethink it necessary to do so,  since it is proposed that this group of problems  should  be  studied by  the  Economic Mission recentlydespatched to  China.   5.  As  regards possible means of improving  the  competitive power  of  British merchants, we do  not think that in this fieldeither  is there much  scope for action by His  Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment.   The Export Credits Guarantee Department  has explained to us  their  attitude towards the grant of credit facilities for theChinese and other Far Eastern markets.   From this it  appearsthat,  subject to the present rules which exclude textiles from thescope of the Department,  there is little likelihood of the  Depart-ment doing any serious amount of business in China.   We are not altogether convinced that it might not be  possible to increase theassistance rendered by the Department to British traders in Chinaby the removal of  some of the restrictions at present imposed.  Onthis point  we  have   asked  to  be  furnished with  a   further memorandum  by that Department.     (b) The Artificial Strengthening of the Yalue of Silver.   6.  The present  difficulties of  traders  in  China  have beenaccentuated by the fall in the exchange value of silver, and it  hasbeen suggested that the latter might be improved by such measures as the restoration to its former standard  of the subsidiary  silvercoinage in this country,  or the cessation of sales of  silver by  theIndian  Government  from  the paper  currency reserve until  theprice  of silver recovers  to  some  agreed level.  We  believe thatthese  proposals are  misconceived,  and that action on those lines would  prove at once expensive and fruitless.   In  our view thereis a far better chance of an improvement in the price  of  silverbeing effected through the  restoration of  Chinese  internal trade,as  a  result of  peace and  the  improvement  of  her system  of communications.(c) Appointment of Engineering Expert at  His  Majesty&apos;s Legation                           at  Peking.    7.   The business of  British merchants in  China has frequentpoints of contact with the  Chinese Government Railway Authori-ties,  local mints  and arsenals,  and  public utility  undertakings,such as harbours, electricity works and gas undertakings.   Britishmerchants could be assisted in  their competition with foreign rivalsby the co-operation  and advice of a  special officer  of experience in the engineering business world  to whom the title of Counsellormight be given.  If, as we suggest in paragraph 33 below, discus-sions with the Chinese Government are initiated at  an early date with a view to exploring the problem of the terms  on which inter-national finance might be  made available  for the rehabilitation of chinese railways,  the presence of such an officer on the spot mightbe of great value to His  Majesty&apos;s  Government.
Ill THE  IMPORTANCE   OF  IMPROVING  INLAND            COMMUNICATIONS IN CHINA.   8.  It will be seen  from the  foregoing  paragraphs that the direct  assistance which  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  can give toBritish traders in China is limited.  We have, therefore,  considered whether  it  would be  possible for  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government to initiate or  support  any action  which   might result  in such  animprovement of general  conditions in China as would be reflected in increased exports  from the United Kingdom to that country.   9.  From  such information  as  we have  obtained, we think it unlikely  that  British trade in China can be largely  increased in-existing circumstances, especially  as concerns  the limited  treatyport,  markets,  i.c.., those accessible by sea and river.  An important,reason of this limitation  of  the China  market is  to  be found inthe inadequacy of modern means of transport in that country.   10.  China has benefited  greatly from  such railways as havebeen built,  but  in  1926, the latest  year for which authoritativefigures are available, there were not more in the  whole of Chinathan  approximately  7,200  kilometres  of main line  railways inoperation,  and  about  3,000  kilometres  of  branch lines,  sectiontracks, loops and sidings, say 10,000 kilometres in all.   Additionalconstruction in Manchuria and  elsewhere since  that date has notexceeded  1,000  to 2,000  kilometres of track.   Of  this  limited amount of railways,  a  large part must be regarded as  semi-derelictowing  to the ravages of war and banditry.   11.  In  a recent  publication  the  United States CommercialAttache in  China draws  an interesting  contrast between  railwayconditions in China  and in America.   No single factor,  he pointsout,  has contributed in  a larger way  towards  economic advance-ment in the United States than has the  railway.  In the  same way,economic inland transportation is of the  first importance  to China&apos;sagricultural, mining  and  manufacturing trade.   Nothing  morevividly portrays China&apos;s economic backwardness in  contrast with conditions  in  America,  than  the  fact  that   though   China  is considerably larger in area  and has a  population three or four times  as  great, it has less  than  one-twenty-fifth of the  railwaymileage of  the  United States.   Furthermore,  some  of  the morepoorly  administered  railways  in China  are charging freight rateseight and ten times as high as  those obtainable in America.  Solong as China has to  depend upon human beings, pack animals,and, in some cases badly operated railways, for land transportation,the economic life-blood of the nation will remain almost stagnant.Even though millions of human  and animal carriers are impressedinto  service in China the aggregate amount of cargo hauled is onlya negligible fraction of that  carried over America&apos;s railways.   Heconcludes with the following  striking observation :  &apos;&apos; The economiclevels of the great masses in  China cannot be substantially raiseduntil a considerable portion of the  load  is lifted  from the backs of human and  animal  beasts of burden  and  placed on less costlycarriers,  and provision made for the economical transportation ofthe hundreds  of millions of tons of cargo not now being carried.&quot;   12.  Furthermore,  not only  are great parts of China ill-served by roads or waterways, but others,  such, for example, as the richprovince of  Szechuan,  contain to-day not a single mile of railway.Its only method of approach  is by way  of the Yangtze Bapids, andalthough it contains  one-tenth  of  the  population  of  China, it isnot surprising to find  that in existing conditions it consumes onlyone-hundredth part of China&apos;s foreign  imports.   13.  We  are  satisfied  that  the   China  market   could  be appreciably  expanded  by  improved  railway  and  road  transport.We believe  that  the restoration  and re-equipment of the existingrailway system  would at once  give a  strong impetus  to  foreign trade in China.   If, when the present  railways  had been brought up to  a reasonable standard  of  efficiency,  it were found possibleto undertake  new railway construction, an  even  greater  propor-tionate improvement  in  foreign trade,  including  British  trade,
                 IY. CHINESE RAILWAYS. (a) Methods by which Railway  Construction has been Financed.    14.  The  first  railways  in  China  were financed by  foreigngroups, who obtained concessions  authorising them to constructand operate railways for a fixed period of years, the gain or loss on  the transactions to be to the account of the concessionnaires.Under these concessions,  the railways were ultimately to  becomeChinese property either by purchase  or by the mere lapse of theperiod of  the concession.   Concessions for railway  building were obtained   by the  Russians   in  Manchuria, by the  Germans  inShantung, by the French and Belgians in North China (Peking-Hankow),  and by the French in Yunnan.  Of these, the Russianrights  in  Southern Manchuria  have now become  Japanese, the franco-Belgian and German concessions  have  reverted to China,while the  French line in Yunnan is still operated as a concession.    15.  In the period 1899-1908 a different method was adopted byBritish financial  groups to enable railway construction to be carriedout in China.  Loans were  made to  the  Chinese Government  for construction, the railways when built being from the  outset theproperty of the Chinese Government.  The lenders stipulated thatBritish  engineers  and accountants  nominated  by, or at  leastacceptable to, them should be appointed by the Chinese Governmentto ensure  proper expenditure of the  monies advanced.  On their part, the  Chinese Government gave an unconditional guarantee  tomeet  interest  -and amortisation  payments on specific dates out  ofthe earnings of  the railways, or if these  were inadequate  for thepurpose, from other sources, and to  deposit the railway earnings in the bank of the lenders.   These undertakings were to  remainoperative  until  the  loans,   the  duration  of  which  varied  from30  to 50  years,  were  fully redeemed.  The loans were raised inLondon by  public  issue of  Chinese  Government sterling bonds.Under arrangements of this kind, approximately  15,000,000 was raised in this country for Chinese railway development.  The mostnotable examples of British enterprise in this period are the Peking-Mukden and Shanghai-Nanking  Railways.    16.  In 1908 a  new method, that  of an international loan, wasadopted for  financing Chinese  railways.   In  this instance thearrangement consisted of an agreement signed by an Anglo-Germanpartnership  providing  for a loan to the Chinese Government  forthe construction  of the Tientsin-Pukow railway.  In 1909 a Frenchfinancial   group  joined the  Anglo-German  syndicate.   This wasexpanded  by the entry of  an American group into the Four-PowerConsortium which signed the final Hu Kuang Railways Agreementof 1911.   In 1912 the proposal  to make an administrative  loan  tothe new Republican Government of China caused the Consortiumto be expanded by  the admission of Russia and Japan.  After the signature  of the Reorganisation Loan Agreement of 1913 the groupsagreed at  the instance of His Majesty&apos;s Government to eliminateindustrial  and railway loans from the scope of the sextuple agree-ment,  and the  Consortium  continued in  existence solely  for thepurpose of  administrative loans.  In 1920  at the  instance  ofAmerica,  the Consortium was reconstituted for  both industrial andadministrative loans.   In this new Consortium Japan was includedbut Germany and Russia dropped out.  The  Belgians, who have important railway interests in China, have so far stood aloof fromall  these  combinations.  The Chinese  Government, on their part,have  also  stood  aloof   from  undertaking  dealings  with  the consortium,  which  they  regard  as  a  combination of financial interests   designed not to facilitate but to limit  their freedom  of borrowing in the world&apos;s money markets.might  be  anticipated.   Some  new  construction  is  already  in contemplation,  but it is  unlikely  that  schemes  involving  large capital expenditure will  mature  until steps have  been taken todeal generally  with  the  railway  defaults  and  debts at presentoutstanding.  Improvement in transportation facilities&apos; is. in ourview, the main problem with  which we are faced.
(b)  The Disorganisation of the Railways.   17.  From 1906 the administration of the railways was  vestedby  the  Chinese  Government in a  Ministry of communications which was created for this purpose.  In the twenty years following,the Ministry built up an organisation which  supervised the  opera-tion of the railways with a considerable measure of  success.  Thecivil wars of the  past ten years gradually destroyed the authorityof the Ministry of Communications;  traffic was  often disorganisedfor months:  bridges  and track and equipment  were damaged or destroyed by  rival factions, and the influence of  the technicalforeign railway officials was reduced to vanishing point.   In 1925the earnings of  several of the railways had fallen so low  that itwas impossible for the Chinese  Government to meet  its obligationsfrom that source. Distracted by civil war, the Chinese Governmentwas unable to  make good these defaults from other revenues.   18.  The  collapse  of  the  Peking Government  in 1928  was followed by the establishment at Nanking of the National Govern-ment, by whom the functions of the Ministry of Communicationswere transferred  to a  Ministry  of Railways.  That  Ministry  has,however, been unable to gain actual control- of the railways  except the lines from   Shanghai to  Nanking,  and from Shanghai  toHangchow.   The most profitable railway,  that from  Peking  toMukden, is  controlled by the Mukden Authorities.  The Peking-Suiyuan and Peking-Hankow lines have been controlled at differenttimes by factions who have seized them or portions of  them.  TheTientsin-Pukow  Railway has  for years been under the authorityof various military leaders, and its  southern section for the lasttwo years has  been  under the personal control of Chiang Kai-shek,the President  of the National Government.               (c) Rehabilitation of the Railways.   19.  The amount  of  capital needed at  the outset for the rehabilitation of  the  railways in China can  only  be determinedas and when the subject is discussed with the Nanking Government,but as  a guide  towards  its  estimation, we give  the  followingcalculation, with which we have been furnished, of the sums whichthe railways  in which British finance  is concerned  could usefullyabsorb for immediate requirements :                                                            Peking-Mukden  Railway.........     500,000      Tientsin-Pukow Railway.........   1,000,000      Shanghai-Nanking  Railway     ......     500,000      Shanghai-Hangchow-Ningpo Railway  ...     500,000      Canton-Kowloon Railway...     ...     ...     500,000      Canton-Hankow    Railway    (Northern          Section)       ............     500,000                                               3,500,000   20.  The immediate requirements of the Peking-Hankow andPeking-Suiyuan  lines  and  of  the  Belgian-financed  Lung-HaiRailway are probably greater, but much could be done to meet them  with a similar amount of  3,500,000 divided between them.With  a further sum of  3,000,000  either  divided  between theShantung   Railway,  the  Canton-Hankow  &quot;Railway  (SouthernSection), and the smaller lines,  or used to increase the allowances to the principal lines, an  expenditure of  10,000,000 spread over two years would suffice to put the existing railways  into working order.                      (d)  Railway Debts.   21.  Any scheme for reconditioning the railways must take intoaccount the  defaults on loans  secured  by the hypothecation  ofrailway revenue, and debts for materials.  The former are clearlyprior  liens,   and the latter have  at least  an equitable lien  on railway earnings.   The delay  in dealing with  these  debts hasresulted in  their increase  by years  of  accrued interest,  and the longer a settlement is postponed the more  difficult will it  be  for china to effect payment and thereby restore her credit.
s   22.  A settlement of these debts by means of a funding loanshould form  an integral part of any plan for assisting China in railway rehabilitation.   So far as the London market is  concerned,the principal defaults to the end of 1930 are,  in round  figures, asfollows : Name of Railway.	I Interest, j Principal.		Total.Canton-Kowloon Railway ... Tientsin-Pukow Railway ... Hukuang Railway, i.e., Hankow-Canton (Northern Section)	  305,000 1,750,001.) 1,103,000	  513,000 2,350,000 032,000	  818,000 4,100,000 1,795,000	3,218,000	3,495,000	6,713,000   23.  In  addition to the foregoing, there are large  amounts  indefault on the Belgian Railway loans, for interest and principal,  aswell  as  on advances made to the Ministry of  Communications for railway  purposes by British and other foreign financial groups andby Chinese  banks.   It is not possible to give  accurately the total sum involved, but at a rough estimate the sum  of  5,000,000 would at least go  a long way  towards re-establishing Chinese credit  inrespect  to the obligations referred to in  this paragraph.  The totalliabilities  of the Chinese railways  in  respect of defaults on  loans and   advances   may  therefore   be   taken   as   approximately 12,000,000.   24.  There  remains   the  debt of the  railways  for  materialssupplied in  past years and not paid for.  The  British figure underthis  heading is approximately  2,000,000, in addition  to which thereare  large  amounts due  to American,  Continental and  Chinesesuppliers, bringing the total debt for materials to at least  5,000,000.   25.  A comprehensive scheme for railway  rehabilitation would,           ^therefore,  involve  expenditure  under  the  following  three  mainheads:                                                            Reconditioning  of existing railways......     10,000,000   Provision for defaults on loans and advances     12,000,000   Provision for debts for materials    ......     5,000,000                                                  27,000,000   26.  The foregoing  amount could be reduced to the extent  ofabout  7,000,000 by  eliminating the repayment  of capital sums  indefault  on  loans  and  leaving  their  settlement  in   suspense.Bondholders who  could get  arrears  of  interest  paid  up might  besatisfied to wait for repayment of drawn bonds if it could be shownthat the railways were to be reorganised and efficiently managed.   27.  The solution of the problem depends upon the provision ofmoney, which would be  wasted unless China agreed to adopt a systemof railway administration capable of safeguarding and respecting theinterests of investors.   If, however, the railways could be freed  byconsent between the rival parties,  from military use  and  inter -ference, and placed under efficient control exercised by the Ministryof Railways, the problem of restoring their physical condition andundertaking their gradual development would present little difficulty.&apos;Its  solution would need an  expenditure beyond  China&apos;s presentresources, and the capital required would,  therefore, have  to be foundabroad.                   (e) The Outlook in China.    28.   From the best information available, we consider that theprospects of peace in China are to-day better than at any time duringthe  last ten years.  In recent months a truce has put an end toactual hostilities, and,  what is of  greater importance, an agreed settlement has been reached between the two most important parties in China, namely,  the  Nanking Government  and Manchuria.  Thepublic  announcements  of all leaders,  including  the President,Chiang Kai-shek, and the Manchurian Marshal, Chang Hsueh-liang,indicate a  general desire to  make an  end of civil warfare andbanditry.  Mr. T. V.  Soong  the present Finance  Minister  of the
Nanking Government, has  shown  a firm  determination  to restoreorder to the National finances, and he has the full support of  theChinese Banks.   Although he has been severely  handicapped by military expenditure, his efforts during the past year entitle him to high praise.  There are clear indications, both from the discussions at the plenary  session of the Nationalist Party and elsewhere, thatChinese statesmen are alive to the  importance of rehabilitating therailways, and  that they realise that, as the expenditure involved would be beyond China&apos;s present  resources,  the  capital required would have to  be found abroad.  We are, therefore, of the opinionthat conditions in China may  shortly be such that foreign capitalmight safely be made available for  the rehabilitation of her railway system.             (f)  Methods of Financing Rehabilitation.    29.  An  essential condition of lending  money to China for thispurpose would, of course, be that the Nanking Government shouldbe  able  to gain control of the principal railways,  or at least someof them, and should be able to satisfy themselves  that under their control  the  railways  would  be  administered efficiently  withoutmilitary interference.  The further consideration would then arisewhether individual efforts or concerted action  would be preferable,whether for  example, British finance should concentrate  on trying to improve  and extend certain railways-, while American,  French,Belgian, Japanese, and &quot;possibly, German interests competed with us  and sought  their own openings;  or whether the existing policyof combination should be pursued in  some  modified form  acceptable to China.    30.   The choice between these alternatives  will  have to be made before any action can be taken.   As things stand, British financeis committed to the principle  of partnership with America, Franceand Japan under  the Consortium Agreement of October  1920, andto the  still wider principle of equal opportunity in China for all nations, in accordance  with the terms  of the Nine-Power Treatysigned at Washington in 1922.  If  this arrangement were dissolvedBritish interests would be free to negotiate individually with Chinafor loans of public issue, and to stipulate for the expenditure inthis country of loan proceeds for  the purchase  of British  materials.    31.   Such freedom sounds  attractive, and would, in fact,  be so if there were any reason  to believe that the London market alonecould find the  money needed  by China; but  neither  London  norany other  single market could issue successfully a loan  for Chinafor railway  purposes unless  the  outstanding defaults and  debtswere  provided  for.   The estimate of  approximately  27,000,000 asthe amount  needed to put  existing  Chinese  railways into  orderincludes cover  for  amortisation and  interest payments in  default,and debts  for  materials.  Without such cover it would  clearly beimpossible for  China to re-establish her credit  for railway loans.The prior liens on Chinese railway earnings constituted by  theearlier  loans present a  difficulty in the  way of  creating a newobligation of great magnitude which would only rank  as a secondcharge.  This  difficulty could best  be met by  the  complete extinc-tion of the earlier loans  through an  exchange  of the old  bonds forbonds in the new  loan,  and  we are advised that this step wouldhave  the effect of bringing  to an  end  the  old  Loan  agreements which are  objectionable to China.  The amount of the old railwayloans outstanding at the end of 1930  is approximately  21,000,000.The initial loan would therefore have  to be so large as  to renderits  issue impracticable except on an international basis.   Thus itappears  inevitable  that the choice must be made  in  favour of a continuance, in principle,  of international co-operation.                      (g) The Consortium.    32.   The Chinese Government, however, have for  many  yearsconsistently  refused to make  use  of the existing instrument ofinternational  co-operation,   namely,  the  Bankers&apos;&apos;  Consortiumdescribed in paragraphs 15 and 16 above. Unless some way is found of overcoming  this  difficulty,  there  is  a  danger  that when. jtheconditions become favourable  for the flotation of an internationalreconstruction loan-and we are of opinion that this situation may
arise in the near  future the financiers best qualified  for dealingin the  Chinese market may not be in a position to take advantageof the opportunity and  that China  might thus  be  cut off  fromany regular means of financing her requirements.   We therefore suggest that  the  British  group in  the Consortium   should  beinformally encouraged by His  Majesty&apos;s Government  to get into touch  with the  Chinese Government  with a  view  to  initiatingconversations  on the lines  of this Report.  &apos;   33.  It has  been put to us that  the  Chinese  suspect that thereal purpose of the: Consortium is to serve as the instrument forthe economic,  and perhaps even political, domination of  China;and that  the  limited&apos; membership of the present  Consortium is ofsuch a character as to support  this suspicion.   It is, in our view,highly advisable that the ! financial  group  formed to  handle thebusiness,  whilst including  and  initiated  by the  members of the consortium,  should be of  a much wider character, including inparticular as large a Chinese element as  possible  and covering allresponsible  financial interests  desiring to participate  in  finding the money; and that it should not be so designated or so introduced to the Chinese  as  to carry  with it the odium  now  attaching,  on grounds of Chinese amour propre, to the Consortium  of 1920.  Weare of opinion,  also,  that the methods as well  as the  constitutionof the  Consortium may require  revision.  In the case of industrialloans,  the Consortium has adopted the practice of linking loans withorders for the materials  to be purchased out of the proceeds of the loans.   There can be no doubt that China would greatly  prefer the abandonment of this practice, against  which there is muchto be  said on grounds of principle. If,  however, she  were to insist on this,  the  task  of  raising the money might,  we are  advised,prove  insuperable.  In this case China might  be well advised to waive  her objections, however reasonable  in themselves,  for thetime being.   These, however,  are questions on  which no certainconclusion can be reached until the matter has been fully discussed with  the  Chinese  themselves   and  their  mind  has  been  fullydisclosed.  The deadlock between China and the Consortium hascontinued for some eighteen years and no serious effort has yetbeen&quot; made to  resolve it.   We consider that  the  time has  now arrived&apos; when the  whole&apos; question should be thoroughly  exploredwithout  further delay.   We are informed  by  Sir Charles  Addis,one  of our members, that he  has  reason  to believe that such  asuggestion would commend itself not only to the British group.butalso to&apos;the other groups in  the Consortium.                 &apos;&apos;  .&apos;                Y. THE BOXER INDEMNITY.   34.   We have been furnished with  papers giving particulars ofthe recent agreement with the Chinese Government in regard to thedisposal of the payments under the Boxer Indemnitjr.  Oh the merits of this agreement we are divided.            (a)  Yiews of the Chairman and Mr. Dalton.    35.  Some of us  (the Chairman and Mr. Dalton) hold that thisagreement fully carries out  the undertaking given in December 1922by His  Majesty&apos;s  Government to  devote the  proceeds  of theBritish share: of the Boxer Indemnity to projects mutually beneficial to China and  Great Britain.   We do not accept the  view of our colleagues on the Committee that the arrangement by which, underthe new agreement, a substantial proportion of the Indemnity funds should be invested in Chinese  railways with a view  to providing  apermanent educational  endowment can  be regarded  as a  breach either&apos; in the spirit or in the letter of the undertaking  given to the Chinese in 1922.  We are equally Unable  to accept the criticisms levelled by our colleagues  at the provision in  the agreement that purchases of railway material from the Indemnity  funds (amounting at the outset to  3,000,000, which over the next fifteen years will be increased to approximately  . 7,000,000) should be made  only from firms in this country.    36.  We  see nothing in the situation  in China to lead us  to suppose that  some other method of employing the China Indemnity funds would be of greater value either to China or to this country.
On the contrary, we are of opinion that this agreement fully carriesout the undertakings given by this country to China.  It is calculated to provide  a permanent  educational endowment of  great value to china, and, at the same time,  to contribute materially towards the rehabilitation of the Chinese railways and to afford an importantmeans of securing additional employment in the British heavy steel and  engineering  industries, where  it is now most needed.  Weconsider it important to bear in mind that, from a strictly legal pointof view, this country is entitled to the whole of these monies accruingunder the Indemnity.  It is only as an act of grace that this country has agreed  to forgo its rights in this matter in favour of the develop-ment of education in China.  Apart, however,  from the  merits ofthe agreement, on which we are satisfied, there are the strongestpractical reasons against any change of policy at the present stage.The present agreement has only been reached after long and difficult negotiations between  His Majesty&apos;s Government  and the ChineseGovernment and  represents the considered policy of His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment in this matter.  They are, in fact, fully pledged tosecure legislative  approval for it.  Indeed,  the Bill required for thispurpose,  the  China  Indemnity (Application)  Bill, has already received its first reading in the House of Commons, and we under -stand that  arrangements have been made for  its second  reading totake place  on the 20th January next, the day on which parliament reassembles.    Both  on  merits  and   on grounds of  practicalexpediency, we should, therefore, be opposed  to any  attempt tomodify the  terms of the agreement.(b) Yiews  of  Sir Charles  Addis, Sir Arthur  Balfour, Mr. Keynes                         and Mr. Rose.   37.  The majority of us (Sir Charles Addis, Sir Arthur Balfour,Mr. Keynes and Mr. Rose), though appreciating the fact that it  isprobably too late to hold up the Bill now before Parliament and alsothat no modification can be made in the present arrangement withoutthe willing concurrence of the Chinese Government,  are  of theopinion that, in the circumstances which have arisen  since  the BoxerIndemnity  Committee reported, the proposed use of the money maynot be in the best interests either of China or of this  country for thefollowing reasons :      (i) If the money in question is  loaned to the railways without         any  general resettlement of  railway  finance or of the-         liabilities  of  the  railways,   the  bonds received  in         exchange and handed to the  educational institutions will         be in default  from  the outset  and without substantial         value.  Thus the transaction will come perilously near          a diversion of the  Boxer  Indemnity  money from  its         intended purpose, and will be most doubtfully  consistent         with our former professions.    (ii) The introduction of the principle of tied orders, whilst not         technically  inconsistent with the Consortium agreement,         is the opposite principle  to that for which this country         has consistently contended in the case of loans to China,         and which in the past has  proved commercially  sound.   (iii)  A  situation may  arise  shortly which  was  not before the         Boxer  Indemnity  Committee,  in   which  the  whole         question of the finance and rehabilitation of the Chinese         railways will be seriously  taken up.   Assuming that the         Boxer Indemnity money is to .be partly used for railway         purposes, it is conceivable  that, in these new circum-         stances, a modification of the proposed agreement  would         enable it to be used in some other way to facilitate railway         reorganisation generally, both to the greater advantage of         China  and British  trade,  and  also with  the  result of         handing to the educational institutions a  valuable bond,         interest on which might  be duly paid, instead of paper         having no defined security.   We are  therefore strongly of opinion that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment should not  necessarily regard  the matter as a fait  accompli,and  should be prepared to reopen  it in the event  of the ChineseGovernment itself wishing the money to be used in some mannerto the general advantage  of railway reconstruction.
          YI SUMMARY  OF  CONCLUSIONS  AND                    RECOMMENDATIONS.                        (a) Conclusions.   38.  We summarise our principal conclusions as follows:    (i) There are  two possible methods  by which  His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment might assist British trade in China, namely :-   (a) By assisting the  competitive power  of British  merchants inChina;  or by assisting British traders to improve their methods inthat market.   (b) By initiating  action with the object  of  improving general conditions in China.   (ii) Three methods have been suggested by which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment might assist British trade in China, namely :-   (a) An Extension of Export Credits__We do not think that muchcan be looked for under this head, but we have asked  for furtherinformation on  the subject from  the Export  Credits guarantee department.   (b) The Artificial  Strengthening  of the Yalue  of Silver.-Webelieve, however,  that a safer and  surer method of  strengtheningSilver lies  in the process of improving  general conditions in  Chinaand thus creating a natural demand for Silver.   (c) The Appointment of an Engineering  Expert at His Majesty&apos;sLegation,  Peking. The business  of British  merchants in China hasfrequent points  of contact with  the  Chinese Government railwayauthorities and with public utility undertakings.  British merchantscould be assisted  in  their  competition with foreign  rivals by theco-operation  and advice of  a  special officer  of  experience in theengineering business world.   (iii) The revival and development  of the trade of  China would bea factor of first-rate importance in reviving British trade.   (iv) China&apos;s trade can only be revived if there is peace  in China.The  restoration  of her railway system  and  the  development of herrailways and roads in an orderly and organised way is a  necessarycondition to such revival.   (v) There are indications that China would welcome financial andtechnical help for the railways, if approached in the right way thatis, in a spirit of friendliness and  co-operation, which would remove the Chinese dread of exploitation and foreign domination.   (vi) Conditions in China may  shortly be  such  that foreign capitalmight safely be  made  available for the rehabilitation of the Chineserailway system.   (vii) The  manner in  which  help was afforded  would dependprimarily  on the terms reached by the negotiators.  But, even more,on continuing and vital personal relations between  the  diplomatic and Financial representatives of lenders and enterprisers on the one side, and the Chinese on the other.   (viii) Financial assistance for the reconstruction of the railwayscould only  be granted to  China  by some combination of financialgroups representing the countries  principally interested. It would be highly desirable that  the  financial  group  formed  to handle  thistransaction, whilst including and initiated  by the  members  of the consortium, should be of  a much  wider character, and  should, inparticular, include as large a Chinese element as possible and should cover all  responsible  financial interests desiring to participate in finding the money.  It is essential that the constitution of  the group and the conditions sought  to be laid down in any international loanthat may  be floated should not be such as  to incur the  odium nowattaching on grounds  of Chinese amour propre  to the  Consortiumof 1920.    (ix) On the  merits of the Boxer Indemnity, we are divided.
Q 7o  &amp;                     (b)  Recommendations.   39.  We therefore recommend:    (a) That  the  British  group  in  the  Consortium  should  beinformally encouraged by His Majesty&apos;s Government to get into touchwith the Chinese Government with a view to initiating conversations in regard  to  railway rehabilitation  and  development on  the  lines indicated in this Report.   (b)  That  these  preliminary  discussions should  be  directed to ascertaining  whether  China  is   prepared  to  consider  foreignco-operation in the solution of her railway problem,  and, if so, in what form.   (c) That, in the event of favourable consideration being given byChina to  such an overture, His Majesty&apos;s Government should beprepared to consult with the American and other Governments on thesubject of recasting the arrangements now  existing under the ChinaConsortium Agreement in such manner as  to make the co-operationof foreign money markets  in  the  railway loans needed  by Chinaacceptable to Chinese public opinion.    (d)  That, to meet the need indicated in Conclusion ii (c) above,His  Majesty&apos;s Government should consider whether it  would bepossible to appoint a special officer of experience in the engineeringbusiness world at His Majesty&apos;s Legation at Peking.

JENKINS    j   to  the  Committee.2,  Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,     December 29,  1980.   Some of us  (the  Chairman and  Mr. Dalton)  hold that thisagreement is not only a valuable contribution towards the rehabilitation-tion of the Chinese railways, but affords an important means ofsecuring additional employment in the British heavy steel industry,where it is now most needed.   The  majority of us  (Sir  Charles  Addis,  Sir  Arthur Balfour,Mr. Keynes and Mr. Rose) have given reasons (see paragraph 37) forthinking that, in contingencies which may soon arise, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should keep  an open mind as  to the  advisability of altering the present scheme in certain particulars.
