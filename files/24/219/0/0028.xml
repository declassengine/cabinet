MEMORANDUM  BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS.    THIS question was considered in  some detail in 1929  in connexion primarily with a proposal  for the immediate transfer to -the Foreign Office of the control ofour relations with Iraq, but secondarily of our relations with Palestine and Trans-jordan.   The  arguments  then advanced against  the  proposal were  briefly asfollows :     (a) Administration is not the business of the Foreign  Office, and its attempts          to conduct  it in the past have generally been attended by  failure.&apos; An          overwhelming case should  be established before the administration 6&apos;f          any further territory should be entrusted to it.    (b) The outlook, training, and temperament  of administrators and diplomats          are  essentially different.    The Foreign  Office   does  not  produce          administrators,  and when  it  requires them  has to  borrow from  other          branches of Government service.  On  more than one occasion in recent          years the ability of Governors thus recruited to co-cperate with men of          Foreign  Office training has been doubtful.  Yet,  in these Mandated          Territories, though diplomatic abilities may be of importance, the quality          of the. administration is the criterion by which world opinion will judge          the success or failure of the Mandatory Power.    (c) The Sudan, which has been quoted  as an example of successful administra-          tion under Foreign Office control, is under Foreign  Office control solely          because the Condominium with  Egypt makes it impossible to place the          territory under the control of any other Department. That it should          have  been administered with some success is due to  peculiar and excep-          tional circumstances.   Firstly, the Sudan is practically isolated in the          middle  of  the  continent and removed  from external  influences  and          distractions,  so that  all  problems  of  government  are  considerably          simplified.   Secondly, it has been possible to  endow the country with an          efficient  staff  of  numerous  carefully  selected  Englishmen, and the          administration, though good,  is very expensive.  Finally, and resulting          from this,  the amount of administrative control exercised from  London          is infinitesimally small.    At the 249th meeting of  the Committee of  Imperial Defence on the 14th July,19*30, I endorsed these arguments,  which, I explained, embodied my objections to theproposal  for  the transference to  the Foreign Office of  the  general control of ourrelations  with the whole of the territories of the  Middle East.   The Committee ofImperial Defence agreed, however, to  recommend that the question of transferring the general control of these territories to the.Foreign Office should be reserved forconsideration by the Cabinet.    The  case of Iraq is unique, and the Cabinet  has already decided  (on the23rd July,  1930) that when  Iraq is admitted  to the League of Nations in  1932,the responsibility for  our relations with  that country will be transferred from theColonial  Office to the Foreign Office, and preparations  for this transfer should be      5754   [5022]
made between the Departments concerned.  This is, indeed, an automatic consequenceof admission.  Meanwhile, however, it is of great importance that nothing should bedone which might give the impression that His Majesty&apos;s  Government  are trying toprejudge the issue of the admission of Iraq, which must  be  decided by the Leagueitself, in 1932.  Any transfer of responsibility for Iraq to the Foreign Office before1932 would therefore be open to serious political objections.    The question which is now to come  before the Cabinet is primarily therefore that of the proposed transfer to the Foreign Office of control of our relations withPalestine and Transjordan.    It has been contended that in Transjordan our functions are mainly advisory.This  contention,  however,  ignores  the fact that Transjordan is covered by theMandate  for  Palestine,  and from the point of view of our  administrative respon-sibiiities towards the League of Nations, is  part of that territory. v; . In Palestine, the main burden of the British authorities is wholly administrative.It is true that the Palestine Mandate imposes certain restrictions on the administra-tion  and  involves various  international obligations.&apos;  These are,  however, of  acomparatively simple character, and the present system of  close co-operation betweenthe Middle East Department of the Colonial Office and the Eastern Department ofthe Foreign  Office  adequately ensures that such obligations are fulfilled.  But,generally  speaking, apart  from such restrictions  and  obligations,  Palestine  is administered  in practice on much the same lines as ordinary colonial  territory, andthe Colonial Office are naturally far more fitted by training and experience to set up and control the administrative machinery necessary for this purpose.  It is clear,indeed, from such cases as have been referred, tq the foreign  Office regarding affairs in Palestine that a  vast number of points of a purely  administrative character are referred home by the High Commissioner for Palestine to the Colonial Office, andthat the Foreign Office, were they called upon to do so, would be incapable of dealingwith  these domestic oroblems.                                                                        A. H.    Foreign Office,  February 5, 1931.
