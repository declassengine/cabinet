Note by the Secretary.

The question of "Support for the Polish Army" was discussed at the War Cabinet on Thursday, 16th October (War Cabinet 631, Conclusion 4) when the following decision was taken:-

"The Acting Secretary of State for foreign Affairs should draft a reply, for the approval of Mr. Bonar Law. on the following basis:-

(i)That it should be pointed out that His Majesty&apos;s Government ware in general sympathy with the proposal to give support to the Polish Army, and that negotiations were already in progress for providing certain stores for that Army in return far payment:

(ii) That His Majesty&apos;s Government regarded the responsibility for helping the Polish Army to be one which  rested with the Allies generally, and only to a very minor degree with Great Britain; but that His Majesty&apos;s  Government were nevertheless ready to examine the whole question, and possibly help to a minor degree, provided that the French and United States Governments took their share.

The War Cabinet further decided:-

The British Military Representative at Versailles should be informed --

(a) That His Majesty&apos;s Government intend to limit the stores to be given free to non-marketable munitions, Such as ammunition, ?uns and tanks:

(b) That he should not assent to any recommendation which involved the British Government in the main responsibility for the transport of the stores or for the cost of their transport."

The question was again considered at the 10th meeting of the finance Committee (Minute 1) held on the 20th October, when;


&quot;In view of tho heavy contribution which the British Government hei given to General Denikin, as part of an arrangement under which the French were to undertake the main responsibility for helping Poland, the Cabinet Committee decided that -Any assistance which it might be possible for the War Office to give to Poland should form a contribution to an Allied effort, and hot be an independent contribution.&quot;In,view of the above decisions the attached report (S.W.C.473) of the Military Representatives to the Supreme War Comcilon the subject is interesting, both as regards the amount of help allocated to each of the Allied Countries (Annexure 1 to the report) and still more so as regards the attitude of the United States Government towards this problem.

The Permanent American Military Representative.To   :   The Permanent Military Representative,French Section, British Section, Italian Section.Supreme War Council.With reference to the proceedings of the seance of the Military Representatives at Versailles on October 6th, at which seance the Military Representatives considered the recommendation of Marshal Foch relative to the supply of material to the Polish Army, I have the honour to communicate to you the following.Under date of October 7th, I telegraphed to the United States Secretary of V&amp;v and to the Chief of Staff the recommendation which Marshal Foch submitted to IVClemenceau in a letter dated September 29th; in regard to the dispatch of supplies of all kinds for the Polls?1. Army.   By the same telegram I informed the Government in V-ashing-&apos;,on of the itemized requirements of the Polish Army as subr^/zued by the Polish Minister of War and ,approved by Marshal Foch.In that telegram I asked the following questions:1st. Will the United States participate in thesupply of money o 1 material, or both, for the Polish Army?2nd, If the United States Government should decide to participate, &quot;111 it decide for itself what its contribution shall be or will it agree to contributing equally with such other Principal Allied and Associated Powers as may also parfe anticipate?In reply to the foregoing telegram I have been directed by the War Department in Washington to communicate the following decision to my colleagues:
i] 0boThe Government of the United States has no power under existing legislation to par-anticipate in the proposed support even by distributing surplus supplies.The surplus supplies of the United States in Europe have been largely disposed of and further credit sales to Poland out of the surplus supplies in the United States cannot be approved.Congressional action in the United States would have to precede any further action by that Government and the V.!ar Department is not prepared to recommend such action in its present views of the interests of the United States,(Sd)   TASKER H, BLISS.General, U.S, Army* .
