LMU STIUxT-BUErlKG:     Yes. Sir, THE! PBBEB MIEIS&amp;i:   Will you open, Mr. Sunning?
With &apos; regard to the resolution which...! s -c-oming-^bef^re&apos; you &quot;2o-.cay, we have.here v.ith us the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain, and:v:r. Smillie,&apos; V.r. Hodges, ana Mr, Brace vail speak upon the subject.   I have only to say a few words in introduction, but t?iose few words, if I may say 30, are not unimportant. ..First of all let rae remind you, Sir,  that the Trade Union Congress has for years past agreed to the nationalisation of mines.   It has agreed to the nationalisation of some other thin/re as well, but we have only before us to-day the question of the nationalisation of mines, and although there may have been and. have been reservations on some other subjects, there has never been any reservation with regard to the nationalisation of mines.I ou.-$it also to add, in order to make the thing perfectly clear, that this has not been because the Miners are a very strong and important body.   There was a time when the Miners&apos; Federation, so far as the Trade Union congress was concerned,  represented almost 50 per ocnt of the representation, but that is not the position to-day. . The position to-day,  roughly speaking, is that they represent something like 1?- per cent..   That is . not owin? to any going down of the Miners in organisa-tion.   On the oontrary, they have increased to a very large number, and to very great power, a3 of course you are perfectly well aware; but it is afar to the fact that-. Trade Union organisation has increased in a surprising way.THF P Mtt? MINISTV^:    &quot; specially since the war, I understand ?MR, STUART-&quot;RUNNING:   Yes,  since the war, but it is only rifjht to say that part of the movement was soing on
i 15before the war. 13. u.N&apos;. BARFPS:   Sinc^-^h-e-This-u^jac-e Act.  &apos;MB. OTART-TTOTIirG&apos;:&apos;   Yes, since the Insuranoe^Vct.   But even - - -before the war the position of the miners  Federation was not as great as it had been for many years before.   I am not saying that in any way to derogate from the position of the Miners&apos; Federation.   j,!y real point is that I want to make it quite clear that when I say the Trade Union Congress is in favour of nationalisation, it is not in favour of it because the miners say it 0u.3h.-t to be but because the Trade Union congress, representing as it does a very large body of people, now mere :than five and a half millions, is convinced that nationalisation is the proper policy.   That is&apos; the first point I want to make.I am not going to argue the merits of the Sankey Report or any other Report, because that will be arguec with much more force by gentlemen who arc to follow me; but I do want to draw special attention to paragraph (c) in the paper which I think ycu have had submitted to you; that is, in the event of your not finding yourself in the position of bein;1; able to accept the Majority Report, a special Congress is to be convened for the pur-pose of deciding what course shall be taken,How please do not misunderstand me, and please do not misunderstand, any member of this Deputation;. - that is not intended in any way as a threat. &apos; It is intended, - however, to brin : before you and the House of Commons what, the position is, as we understand it.. As I was just now
saying, the Trade Union Congress has always &quot;believed in nationalisation.   The sankey Report of course is not nationalisation, but it is a very lar^e step towards nationalisation, and while we arc agreed that there may be a sort of interim period before which full nationali-sation can be imposed upon the nation, we have come to the conclusion that you ought to accept not only for the purposes of the miners but for the purposes of every-body the provisions of the Sankey Report,I. said that the Trade Union Congress had come to this conclusion, not because of any particular per-suasion or any particular cc-ercion or any co-ercion whatever from the Miners&apos; &quot;federation, and I ou;$it to amplify that by just one word.   The real reason for theTrade&apos;Union congress accepting the position of national!-thesaticn is that/Trade Union congress has always believed that nationalisation would benefit not only the miners, it would benefit not only the whole of the Trade Union world but it would be of benefit to the whole of the citizen?.ens cf this country.with thost few words I have endeavoured to put   before you the position of the Trade Union Congress, and I am now proposing to ask Ivlr. Smillie to speak, . .
MU. SHILIJEi   Mr* Prime Minister, it is amazina at the present time the amount of information union the Press imparts to the country, correct or incorrect.,   I find in to-day1 s &quot;Express&quot;, I think it is, in dealing with the fact that a Deputation was to be received here to-day on the question of the nationallsa-tion of mines, that they say: &quot;The Prime   inister will refuse this demand, and renew the offer of joint control of the industry on the lines Indicated by him in his speech in the House of Commons before the recess&quot;.   I do not know whether they wish to form your opinion or whether you have formed their- opinion in that paragraph,THE FT! 1MB MIHISTIl.:    I was not even here yesterday, so I could &apos; not have communicated with them either directly or indirectly,1.11*, SIJILLIE;   If that were the position. I feel sure you uoul-&apos; not feel justified in asking us to come here to-day for you to hear us merely to repeat something which you had already said, I take it, sir, that you are still open to conviction if we can convince you that it would&apos; be in the interests of the nation and the right thing&apos; to do to nationalise the mines.NoWj I would like to refresh your memory by reference to a speech made by you in the Opera House, I thin1: when yon. were Minister of Munitions,   You said there that it was an inspiration even for a tired Minister, to be confronted by that fine gather-ing of the representatives of the great mininr industry of this country.   You said you had seen the miner in many spheres and capacities down in Uales; you said &quot;I have sean him as a worker, and there is no better,   I have seen him often as a politician, and there is no sounder,   I have heard, him as a singer, and there is no sweeter&quot;,THE PRIME MINISTER:   That is true,MR,- SMILLIE:   You said &quot;I have seen him as a footballer, and he is a terror *..**. I have seen him sometimes  you must forgive me for reminding you      as a striker, and he in very difficult&quot;,THE PR 111, MIHISTB-K:   It is true,-7-

SMILLlEr . &quot;For in all -capacities he is always in deadly earnest, always courageous, always loyal, a steadfast friend but a dangerous foe&quot;.-riE PFi:I;-:i&quot;: ? Iinsr Es   I quite agree.MR. SMHitlft:   Now,&quot;ycu-spoke-In that strain of the Welsh miner, whom ycu know beet, and 1 would like you to take it from ms, with seme&apos; lrncwled.ee of the miners in other parts, that the same will apply to the miners generally over the country&quot;*All those, statements, put down here in a way   that. few people could put&quot; then, I would like you to apply to the miners of the country.generally, t hope, sir, that you are still of the same opinion about it,THE j-^IME MPISTERt   I. am, every word of it.MR, SIIILLIE:   You followed, that up by oil ling the attention, of the Conference to the very great usefulness of the miner, to his patriotism during the war, and you lesion that that did not apply only to V/ales but applied generally.   You also called attention to his usefulness as a worker, and you appealed to him to provide the raw material which if as necessary to carry on in this country.   I sincerely -hope that the views expressed by you then with regard to the ijiiner. still hold good, and I feel sure that they do, because anyone knowing the miners will agree, and it might be extended to saying that that is the position that might be applied generally speaklng to all the workers of the country, so far as I know the:iuNow, this is not a new Question, this question of the nationalisation of the mines.   During the recent crises of the last few months      not the latest one, but the continued crises with regard to the position of the miners   certain sections of the Press have endeavoured, to load the country
-    19to believe that the miners were endeavouring to spring some new quest lor.   on the country, to forccTforward.....somothinr whichthe country had not had tir.c&quot;really to consider.   Mr, Bunn lg has told you that the Trade Union Congress passed a Resolution recently, a Resolution.. which, I thinly, has been placed In your hands, and he went the length of saying that ho did not thinlr that the &quot;liners had very much influence at the Congress in brinyin-- them to that way of thinking.   I sincerely hope he was wrona; I hope the miners had a very considerable amount of influence in bringing the Conference to see eye to eye with them on that point,liu. f.)TUA^T-;3UieiI?C5-;   I said they were not the dominating influence.MR. SiilLLI-i:   No, they were not the dominating influence in the Congress, either in the voting or in persuasion, hut Mr. Sunning will tell you that for 20 years the Trade Union Con-gress has. had the question of nationalisation before it, and the Miners13 Federation has passed, at every Conference prac-tically, a Resolution advocating the nationalisation of the mine s.TIM. PRIME MINISTER:   Have you any of the old Resolutions? MR. SMILLIE:   Yqsp, we have a few of thorn here  %W PR BE MINISTER:   Will you let me have some of the old Resolutions?MR. SMILLIL:   Some of them are joint Resolutions d^alinr: with what we used to call the old nationalisation or socialisation Resolution, but sometimes the Resolution is distinct in dealing with mines as distinct from other things.I would, remind you and your colleagues in the Government, Mr. Prime rinister, that, an a matter of fact, the miners some years ago drafted, a Bill called &quot;The Nationalisation of Mines&quot; Bill, which was presented by Mr. Stephen Malsh to the House of Commons and had a hearinr there.   I only emphasise that In order to prove tc you that this has &quot;.ot been sprung upon the nation in a hurry, but that it has been considered &apos; r;ain and a  a in, not only.. by the miners out by the general
bo dy of&apos;&quot;the-.represaiTO:ajc       -rcrf&apos; x;;ri3- T^acLcT&quot;Unu/rr1&amp;m,^nb --cur---&apos; capreasod in the Trade Union -Congre:- a.    Now, i would like to put before you as briefly as I can, what led up to the Commission which the Government ware kind enough, through you, to offer to the miners.   . Yoa may remember that wo put forward a claim for a substantial increase in wages and for a reduction in the hours of labours      Those claims were the out some of Resolutions sent fxom Districts, and consideredby Conferences-of the Minors&apos;.1 Frderation.&apos;    You met us hereIand you made a certain offer with regard to the wages, which we could stct see   our way to&apos; accept at the time.   We took a ballot of the. minors, nationalisation of the mines;  being one of the questions, the increase of 30 per cent, in wages another, and the roduction-of.the hours of labour to f- hours a day in the. mines being another question.     The &apos;ballot of the miners on this question showed an overwhelming majority in favour.of a general stoppage if those pointy were not conceded.:    We met you after that, and you pointed out to us that, with the information the Government had at their disposal, it was quite impossible and unreasonable to expect that you could give a final thought-out debision on those matters without the fullest possible enquiry and information.   You offered a Commission.   Some of us, becaueo of our experience of previous Commissions, rather doubted the &quot;risdom of putting this case before a/Commission, but we ultimately agreed, Sir,-on your suggestion, to allow this whole question to go before the Commission which you were about to set up.     Mr. Hodges and myself, who were the permanent officials of the minors Federation, had the greatest possible difficulty, on the day on which we finally met you on this matter in the Central Hall, in getting tho delegates who were there assembled to take part in the Commission;   we ultimately succeeded in getting them to vote in favour of taking part in that Commission and you were kind enough to appoint Mr. Herbert Smith, Mr. Hodges and myself as representing the miners on that Commission.
i j  1 .91*&apos; We * jfiUc &quot;bound down to a certain time, and we wore expected to report in that tine.   An Interim Report was published within about a-month.   That Interim Report dealt with the wages question and the question of hours, but pointed out that wo wore not in a position to deal then with the question of the nationalisation of the mines.   That Commission, which was composed of threeminors, six representatives of tho public outside of the miners,Vand three mihe^owners, with a Judge as Chairman, issued threeiReports.   The Judge and throe of tho representatives, which 1 might call the representatives of industry, reported with regard to the nationalisation of mines as follows:    &quot;Even upon the evidence already given, the present system of ownership and working in the coal industry stands condemned, and some other system must be substituted for it, either nationalisation or a method of unification-tion by national purchase and or by joint control&quot;.Now it is well to remember that Mr, Balfour, Sir Arthur Buckham, and Sir Thomas Royden, the three representatives of industry, joined with the Chairman in that statement.Six Members of the Commission issued a Report in favour of nationalisation, in favour of the shorten!, lg of the hours of labour to six, and in favour of the full increase in wages.   That.,.is, that ten of them at least reported either in favour of nationalisation or in condemnation of the present system. That was overwhelming, I think.That led ue up to the second stage of the Commission. It was thought that there had not been (sufficient evidence taken and as a matter of fact it was alleged that we were not expected to dual with nationalisation, in the first sittings of the Commission, but that that should be reserved for the second sittings. The second sittings took place, and the mine owners&apos; side and the landowners; side put forward, I think, all the information they could secure, put forward experts, and   put forward figures of every kind against the nationalisation of the mines.   After a lengthened hearing, at which the miners gave evidence, and every t-
? 2fa h*interest - the Chairman endeavoured to get every interest that would he likely to throw light on the subject to give evidence before that Coj-nmission      the Commission finally closed the evidence, and the Chairman reported in favour of nationalisation. Six Members of the Commission who were not seeing eye to eye with him on every point agreed with him on nationalisation, and were prepared to sign his Report, but he did not feel inclined to have his Report signed by them, so they signed a Report in which they said they were in practical agreement with the Chairman.   The whole of the Commission were agreed that the private ownership of the minerals ought to be dealt with, that it was not in the interests of the country or of the nation that the minerals, the coal, should any longer be held by private individuals.   That is one thing on which the whole Commission was agreed   so that I take it that that at least is outside of controversy.Now Sir, I do not know whether you can call to meaorj your conversation with us - there were no notes taken by any-one;   it was quite a hurried meeting we had - when you were called down, and were kind enough to come from the platform of the Central Hall on the day on which we finally agreed to accept the Commission.   You put it &apos;*here that you could not be expected to deal with such a question as the nationalisation of mines unless you had the fullest information that would satisfy the country that the question had got a fair hearing.   I may say that we naturally took it from that, and we reported to our Conference, which was then wwaiting ua, that you could not see your way, and the Government could not see their way to act on the question of nationalisation and the other important questions which were before you unless they had the fullest information, and we naturally took it that if the Commission, having heard all the evidence they could hear, reported in favour of the nationalisation of the mines, the Government would nat ionalise . the minvjs.Now the Miners put forward this claim primarily on the
question of safety.   I need not go into the facts which appear from year to ,year in the Chief Inspector&apos;s   Reports of the death and accident rate in the minus, because they were fully gone into at the Commission,   Those of us who are deeply concerned in this matter have them before us from year to your, and, rightly and wrongly, wo-believe that the doqth and accident rates in the mines could be considerably reduced, and would be considerably reduced under the national ownership of the minesPThe Coal mines of this country, down to the present time, at least down to comparatively recent times, have been carried on   more in the interest of dividends than in the interests of the nation or of the workers in the industry itself * We allege that output, generally speaking; is the firei consideration.   Now., Sir, I put it to you, and 1 feel sure what your reply will be, that output should not be the first consideration^   V/e put it that the safety of the workers, as far as that can possibly be gone into, should be the first claim on the mines of the country,   We say that&quot;under theitprivate ownership of mines the safety of the workers will not .be, and cannot be, the first charge, but that, output and dividends on invested capital will continue to be the first change. iIn the second place., we lay it down that it was proved to the vast majority of the Commission that the past method ofworking the mines was not the best method in the interests of the State   that, I think, is fairly generally agreed toat the present time   and that a change must take place0 There is no mining engineer in this country that has gone into this matter who is not aware of this.   All your officials in the Mining Department at the Home Office have gone into it again and again; and I have had an opportunity of sitting on a Royal Commission for three years on the Coal Conservation Committee, for nearly two years during the war,   and anybody who has taken a deep interest in the working of the minesI3.c
2 4   &apos;is aware of the fact that there have been millions and millions   . of tons of coal irretrievably lost to the nation because of the system of working a id because of the system of ownership of the mineral royalties of the country,,Sir, no one can ovor-ostimate the importance of coal tothis country.   We hcv c not yet reached the stage of being able to invent a substitute for it.   It is still the life-blood of industry.   It is limited in quantity *   It oonnoi be replaced;and it ought to bo a national property.   It is too important to the nation iso be played with in the hands of private owners to be loft in vast barriers between two different royalty owners.   I .do not think that that requires very much urging onthe part of any miners&apos; representative to justify a conclusionbeing come to.Now we say that the private ownership of the minerals,as apart from the mines themselves, has not only led to waste,,has not only led to millions of tons of ooal being irretrievablylost to the nation in the mines, but it has led to more;   it has led to the uneconomical working of the mines9 and it has ledto raising very considerably the cost of productions   The leavingof barriers between one royalty owner and another has many atime given considerable trouble to mine   owners and theirengineers themselves in working, because of that.   It has donemore;   it has something forced men who had their capitalinv-sted in mining, or who were going to invest their capital in mining, to sot down two or three or four sets of pumpinggear and plant to drain a field of coal, where one would havedone if the mineral had all been owned by the State instead of by two individual owners working it,.   On thft ground it is notin the national interest that minerals should any longer remainin the hands of private peoplesI need not go any more fully into that, Sir,   Tho evidence given before the Commission is so conclusive that it is quiteunnecessary that we should go further into that, further than to
say that in many oases the owner of the minerals has laid it down aa a condition that no coal pit was to he sunk: within a certain distance of hie mansion house;   it might he a mile or two miles, but it must be sufficiently far away to make sure that no smoke ooming from the chimney stack at the colliery could he seen from the highest turret of hie castle, *In the interests of safety we. a ay it is wrong that mining should be carried on in such a way as- to take the workings a   j long way from the working shaft,, to have men hauling coal a mile, a mile and a half, or two miles;   and also the fact of the danger which arises from explosions and other things because of the long way in^br/o     hose Joints in themselves were sufficient to condemn the private -ownership of minerals. Now I would like to say that the Miners have held all along that as they invest their lives in this industry, they are entitled to have a voice in the control of it.    There was a time when you would get very few   people outside of the workers themselves to admit the right of the workers in any industry to have any voice in control:,    lo\it happily, we are getting, away from that,,    Many Members of the House of Commons, and some Members, I &quot;1b lievo, of your own Govern-ment who are with you from day to day admit that there is some claim for the workmen employed in an industry, especially in a remarkably dangerous industry, having some voice in control.     That is a very important point, &quot;because the Miners claim some voice in the control of the mines,,    I want to put it perfectly clearly that because of the dangerous nature of mining, there has been more legislation for safety during the past 70 years than in any other industry.
I HE PKIiMB MISTER:   I do not want to interrupt you if you are gplng to deal with it, but this, I agree with you, is a very important point, I want to know exactly what ycu mean by &quot;a voice in control&quot;,,   Lo you mean that part of control which deals with the safety of the men, or do you mean the commercial part of it?ME SKILLJB:   I am going on to deal with it*      I was pointing out that there was more legislation passed probably for safety of life and limb in our trade because of its perils than any other, and it has been absolutely essential that some person should be held responsible for carrying out the safety legislation..   This is perfectly clearnTHE milM MINISTER:&apos; -Yes,MR SKILL HI: It is now placed upon the certificated maxager who is in charge of the mine, and he and he alone is held responsible, or in his absence the per:n n who takes his place.     The btate holds him responsible for the parrying out of the legislation which has been passed from time to time for safety, and he has enormous power as we 11 as enormous responsibility.   We do not say that we miners are entitled to go in and undertake any share of his power unless we are also prepared to take a share  n his responsibility^     Vie admit that if you begin to divide-up responsibility, the probability is that it will lead to greater daigera than you would wish to incur, and consequently somebody must still be left to be responsible for thatuTHE PRIME MINISTER:   For management,
w (MR SMI1LIB:   For management - that is for- carrying, out the safety legislation for the mine,     The manager do en many things besides looking after the safety legislation.   But no far as you hold him responsible for the ventilation and for safety, we hold that he should still bo held responsible-and should not be open to interference, but that if there were joint committees, central and local, there are many cases in which thoy could advise the manager on most important points that he is not always acquainted with, and which might load vory largely to greater safety in mining operations-;.     We were up against that very difficultye It is a great deal more easy, I will admit here and now, to claim joint control in an industry than to settle down to secure it, and in mining especially as far as manage-ment is concerned, wo are satisfied of that.   Up to tho present we say that ao far as carrying on the mines,sd&quot; far as safety is concerned, the responsible person who can bo held responsible and taken to court ought not to be interfered with, either by the minors or by the mine owners.But it must be remembered that the mines manager who holds a certificate has down to the present time been\ the servant of tho mine owner-, has bo en the servant of tho; profit owner, and we could givo, I think, if it wera necessary5 numerous cases in which his own opinion hashed to be set aside in order to meet the vvishes of his emplov^rs.-.-17 -1
tb4 P/.I1C MHiI&apos;:KR:   On questions cf safety?Ma. oidlLLI^;   On questions of safety.     Many s time we have had complaints from our people 1dth regard to supplies of timber, for instance, and with regard to sapplies of other kinos of things for the safety of the mia.es that the manager found he could not got.     :T1he result should have been that he ought to have shut the mine, but he  new that he dated not shut up the mine or sections of the mine, or else, of course, being in the employ of an employe;1 that would lead to his dismissal.     It is only fair to say ih?t in the vast majority of cases, probably everything possible has been done to keep the supply cf every fain.; necessary for safetyin the hands of the Manager : s 0 that he might do his best to carry out the safety sections of the Act,I put it before you once, Mr, Prime Minister, in this room that during, the whole, of the years of negotiations between the Mine-owners and the miners in the various sections of the Miners&apos; Federation on the wages question or any other question the minors&apos; representatives- have been denied access to any information contained in the hooks of the employers,&apos;ei ther as to prices, output, or anything else.      hen we met to discuss the wages questions we wore net by statements from the mine-owners, and when we ashed for the production of books or information which would justify us in coming to a conclusion, we were told that that was not our business, that the men who bafl their money invested in the mines were the people who were entitled to all that, information and that we had no claim upon it.Now, sir, we are not prepared to admit that;   we are not prepared to admit that our people are not entitled to havo a very considerable voice in the executive control of the mines outside of those safety clauses.     If we are entitled to any executive control;   if it is admitted by the Government that we will be entitled to any executive control even if the State takes over the nines   and we claim that wc ought
iVIto he 071.&apos;&apos;./.! tied to some executive control than -* if that is admitted, then, sir, it --&quot;ill &quot;be essential that the Dines shall be nationalise^ because, speaking&apos; on behalf of the collier y-or^rs of the Unite3 Klngdoav, Lord (lF.:izAx.ffi. gave evidence before the osnkey- ComawLs si on ?.mrl he stated he Was tavin6 evidence on behalf of the colliery o-Tiers and &quot;&quot;as ap]..uir tec by the colliery owners of the kin;. r&quot;&apos;om, and that he could bpeai; on their behalf.     Here is a sta/tecent which Lord Gain for a ma do-?  -the Chairman, Mr, Justice aankey., puts this in has depart:   &quot;The attitude of the colliery&apos;owners is veil expressed by loid Gainfcrd, nho, speaking on their behalf as a witness before the Commission, stated:    rI an authorised to say on behalf of the Mining association that if owners are not to be left complete executive control they will decline to accept the responsibility of carrying 0:1 the industry, and, though- they regard nationalisation as disastrous to the country, they feel they would in such event be driven to the only alternative   nationalisation on fair terms&apos;&quot;..

Happily, he said that on the third reading of&apos; the Bill, just in time for the House of Commons to put in another clause making it a criminal pffence for any owner to refuse to give access to the Mines Inspector,THE PRIME MINISTER; That was a threat on his part of direct actions (LAUGHTER),MR, SMIL-LIE:   And the Government met it by direct action.THE PRIME MINISTER3, That is so;MR, SM1LLIE; By putting a Section into the Act.. So that this, to us, means that if the employers are not loft with complete executive control they are not prepared to carry on the mines? I have dealt with the interest of the miners largely, and now I am going to deal with the interests of the community,-2 Op
Perhaps you would not expect me- to any anything on behalf of the communityo IRS PRIME MH1ST3R: Oh.! yes, I wouldoH)h-,Si&apos;.&apos;lILL.[S?   I want the mines nationalised in order thut, bythe fullest possible development on intelligent lines, wi-chthe assistance of the engineering power which we know wepossess and the inventions which we know we possess, we mightlargely develop the mines and increase the output)      Thatis one of our first claims;   we want the output increased Inorder that it might be possible to reduce the price of coal..The price of coal, I think, will ne\-er again reach the point that it reached previously in die memory of some of us., butit is tfcW hugher at the present time &apos; than it ought.to bec/iA&apos;    -r
If tho industries of the country arc to have a fair chance of succeeding, thbn the output must be increased, and tho price of coal must be considerably reduced, ^e believe it can be considerably reduced, and would be considerably reduced^ with the proper development of tho mines, it is rather a difficult, question for a non-mining person fully to grasp or to realise,. but it is not a difficult question for practical minors or skilled mining engineers to grasps that we havo not developed the mines of the country - as we ought to hove developed thorn,. V/c havo hot taken out all the- coal that we ought&apos;to have taken out, and to that extent the community hoe boyn robbed of -advantages which they ought otherwise to have seoureda now wo propose, not only that the.mineo should be nationalised end worked under the joint control of the state and the mine workers, and when we say &quot;mine workers&quot; we think thyt the skilled engineers engaged in the mining industry ought also, to have a part, and a very important part in the control of the mining industry.Might I say that in the case of th&apos;? witnesses put forward on behalf of the mine owners, their strongest pisa seemed to be that there would be no incentive to produce the highest quantiay of coal under national-ownership0 They said: &quot;If. you removo the present owners of the&quot;mines, and take them over by tho state, there will be no incentive to do their, best&quot;0 Others again said; -&quot;from our experience of state departments it&apos;will be ruinous to hand ever the mining industry to the State- to; be carried on by a State department&quot;, I think you heard during the war a great deal of talk about a business Government, and business men being taken in to run the country during the war.-New &amp; considerable number of th^so business men gave evidence, , men who had boon with you, helping for-two or thrc- years,. . and every one of those men seemed to have discovered that, the best       men were not at the head cf the Department; they seemed to think that if they hod boon the heads of the Departments
everything would have gone on -all right, but that there &quot;was    0 0 waste of ovory description, and that is one reacon, th*y said,, why you ought to hand ever such an important industry as the mining industry to a state department,Kow; Sir, the miners arc of opinion that if the mines are nationalised and taken over by a Stato Department, that state department would be created especially for carrying on tho mining industry, and would be responsible for carrying on the mining industry.   We are not of tho opinion expressed by many witnesses on that point *Then I want to say that It is the meanest argument that could bo put forward that only the incentive to gain its the incentive that has carried on the mines of this country down to the present timoo If the mine owners say (and they have said it in evidence again and again )^hat if you ta?ie away the Incentive      that is the incentive to make money      the mince will not ba carried on ac they ought to bo, I would have thought that the highest incentive would have been tho good and the interest of tho nation itself0 it ought to bo remembered that it is not the owners of the mines of this country who carry on the mines at all; they delegate that to the colliery managers, and it is the oolliory managers who oarry on the mineo, and not the owners thcmeolves. If all the owners were eliminated to-morrow tho output of ooal would go on just the same the. next morning as if they were hero* MR BMCBi Just the same,MR $MILLIE: The. managers w^uld undertake the work as thoy are doing it now, and would carry on the work of production in the interests of tho nation, I feol sure, just as tfcoy had oarried it on pr&amp;viouclyodo not propose merely to nationalise the output of ooal or the getting of ooul and the development of coal mines. &apos; T7e want also to nationalise the distribution of ooal. T* the minors this is not an important question, and they do not. preach it from a selfish point of view at all. It will not.    23.
make any difference to them how the coal is distributed as between producer and consumer, but it ought to make an enormous difference to the ordinary consumers outside of the mines altogether. We think that there is a considerable waste between the producer at the pit rank and the consumer in the domestic grate or in the industries of the country, and we propose that the Government should take over the working of the mines, and should also take over the distribution of coal.

We are of opinion that they can eliminate unnecessary waste that recently goes into the hands of unnecessary middlemen to the extent probably of 2/- to 2/6 per ton. It cannot be said that we are putting forward that claim for the distribution of coal by the state or by the public authorities in order to benefit the miners as a class, but rather to benefit the nation.

Now, Sir, it is on these grounds that we think you ought to give us a reply in the affirmative. Might I just say in a word or two one reason why the proposals which I think you touched upon in the House of Commons would not be satisfactory to the mining community. Sir Arthur Buckham, as you know, made certain suggestions with regard to unification in certain areas.

THE PRIME MINISTER: YES.

MR. SMILLIE: It might be five or ten or fifteen areas -- to unify them, and jointly work them under unification. Might I call your attention to the fact that in this country any of us of the Miners Executive round this table could take you to two different districts of the country not far from each other, and in the one district, either because of the higher value of the coal itself or because of it being easier to procure or nearer to the market, the mine owner could carry on and earn 25 per cent or 30 per cent dividend, while the mine owners in the other district might not be earning dividends at all. Wages usually tend down, wages always have tended down to the ability of the worst situated colliery to pay. You have found that now since you began to control the mines, because you have had to help some districts to enable them to meet the claims....

   
? the wages which you have agreed from time to time. We have always ? that where wages are fixed generally over a large area - over the nation - they are bound to tend down to the ability of the worst situated colliery to go on, or else they must wipe themselves out, and we say that the same thing would apply under unification in districts. THE PRIME MINISTER: It will apply in nationalisation, except on the assumption that you are going to work some mines at a loss.

MR. SMILLIE: As you are doing now.

THE PRIME MINISTER: Yes.

MR. SMILLIE: As you are doing now. We say that it would be wrong to close these mines if you want the coal.

THE PRIME MINISTER: Although you might work them at a commercial loss.

MR. SMILLIE: Yes, You are working the Post Office in some cases at a loss, but you gain in other directions. With anything that you work nationally you must do that.

THE PRIME MINISTER: I do not want to interrupt you, but I want to know what your view is now.

MR. SMILLIE: We anticipate that under certain conditions it is just possible that one district might not be paying the Government, if they do it, as well as another district.

THE PRIME MINISTER: Not as well.

MR. SMILLIE: Not as well.

MR. STUART BUNNING: But is that true only of a Government enterprise?

Has it not often been the case with a commercial enterprise that it loses on one part of it and gains on the other?

THE PRIME MINISTER: You work at a loss for some years, but you find later on that you are developing a business which you hope will pay you.

MR. STUART BUNNING: The whole point is as to whether it is really true.

Is it not the fact that in an ordinary commercial enterprise you can work some part of it at a loss and some at a profit?


IH3 3RI.JS I.iai8&apos;JSDH: You do not work it at a Xosb very long.    n n unless you expect to develop it labor on into a very paying proposition. Of course, in a commercial enterprise you very often work at a particular &quot;branch for five or aiz years at a loss, but that is beoauso you are developing and working it up, m STOiRT BUifUIMG. It a,oes further than that, You may have a seotion of your enterprise     take, for example, a very ooramon oase before the war. It was said that there was no -profit on sugar, The grooer said; &apos;&apos;We cannot uako anyprofit out of sugar, but we sell it beoauso it is an integral part of our business in selling tea, on which we do make a profit,&quot;IH3 Z\Tl1\ IJDISKB: That is a very different iii stance; that is by way of inducing custom.12.S?U^ BUiUIIUG: I do not see that the principle is different,m jBLlIUiIS: I was trying to put it to you, Sir, that generallyspeaking, a miner mi$rt bo doing the same work in the J?orost ofDean or at 3ristoI as he was doing in Yorkshire; that is tosay, he might be exorting as much strength and brain, andputting into his work a3 much at one plaee as at another, and, it might require as much to keep bin or hie family in Bristolor Somerset as it does in Yorkshire, but it is tooonooivableto us that you sb.ou.ld have nine districts of the mines in thiscountry, and that in one dis riot tho workmen would bo getting2/- or 3/- a day, it might be, more than the.; wore gettingin another district because of the unification that it has been proposed to set upa It is just possible that Yorkshire mightbe in a position, o  South &quot;/ales might as one of the sectionsthat you would unify, to go on and pay good dividends and payhighwwages, while another district worse situated might notbe able &quot;to go on at all.. As a matter of fact, ior years and years that has applied even to collieries in tho ssme locality,   I have known of cases in Lanarkshire where beoausc ox the nature of the coal, or their situation, one colliery could go on paying considerably higher wages than anothei&apos; colliery, and the wages have tended down, and it has come either to closing that mine because it was privately owned, or \.he wages have tended down, to the point that would enable that colliery to cairy on,
i&amp;i 30Bi-H L.V.7:   I an trying to  oilor? this, but I do not soe -tho point ox it.     It is true that thorj are mines that cannot be worked oihon except at a loos, and they tend to lover wages, -but if you have big districts it oannot be asbuned that over the whole district it will not be a paying proposition, ill 31.ILL IS : llo.VJt LOJAR JAM: And is it to be assumed that it applies equally to nationalisation?113 SI.1ILLIE: That is why we sc-y if you make a district largo enough jo are eu.ite pleased  - that is, If the district is the nation; but we do wish to take the nation and unify the nations collieries.I at bonar LAW; vftiat ilr Smillie means by ,flarge enough&quot; is that the only, thing that would be large enough for aim is the whole country,,THORHE: Have one. district, hr   Bonar law. I.li ShllLIS; I would not like to say -perhaps that you should go on if you found that you were going to make a hopeless - loss in a colliery, and it might not be worth keeping on at all-.. The probability is tae nation might Etako up its nincl and say: &quot;7/e will not carry on this colliery.&apos;-1, just as under private ov/nership it would be- shut down.      But the nation would have the better chance of carrying it oh than a private employer would have, or has had in tho past,      V/e have known many collieries shut down because they could not meet the existing claims -upon them.Till: VRILU 1.111113TV1R: I want to ask you a question before you Si t dorm, and perhaps you will toll me at once if you think it is a fair question to ask you; it is a very important practical one for us, at any rate.   Supposing -we could not soe our -way to accept your major proposition, the nationalisation pf. the mines in the sense of the nation working then, not (in the sense of tho nation having tho minerals, because they &quot;are two different propostions: but supposing wo could not 
accept your second proposition of tho national control anilyenmanagement of mines, would/prefer them tho existing conditionof things or would yon orofor unification on some such linos a.3 havo &quot;been indicated, with a voice given to the minors in the executive control of the areas? MR SMIL-LIB;     I believe our people would prefer going on as we are at the present time,. or at least as wo wore prior to the war rather than setting up trusts which might bo trusts between tho minors and the mine-owners in a locality against the general public,     Vvo would prfifor going on with tho old system&apos;o &apos;&apos; &apos;       ,.THE PRIME MINI3TER:     That is a straight answer.MR SMlLnrS:   I believe that is the upinion of our Executive and cur Conference.   I believe the time will, come, whether you do it now within the next/throee or four ,years or not, when tho nation will talcs over its mining industry.     I have no doubt at all about that.THE! PRIMS&apos; MINISTER:  ,1 only wanted to know what your view was..MR 3MILLIS-:   We are strongly against ayour taking over the mining - industry and unifying it in. districts and leaving it with the present owners or any owners you might give it over to.TBS PRIMS MINISTER:   Evan with tho miners on the Board?MR  MILLIE:   Yes, ovon with the miners on the Board..TBS PRIMS MINISTER,:   It is a perfectly fair answer.MR S.MILLIE:   It is cur answer, beoause we havo disoussed it. Having said th\-?.t., I do not want to take up any more of .your tire and Mr, Hodges and Mr. Brace will go further into the question,MR STUART PUNNING:.   I will ask Mr. Hodges to address you now.MR, nnTKJiOTCBS: Mr. Prime Minister., one- aspect of this question -with which I think wo must all be concerned is the question of 11J^v    *io^m.ih .p.\ti f irxr,. of tha-Inriv^bcy /it this moment, and
wo must ccmparo it with tho position it enjcyod in 1914or 1913 and try to ascertain whether it holds: oat anyprospects of economic advantage to the country in the future.That is how we approached the problem of nationalisation,and we started looking- at the problem frcm. the point of view cf the industry ti bring us, as miners, improvements in ourcf the ability/social and industrial life as well as bringing more coal, better coal and cheaper coal to the community. That is hew wo have to regard it;   if it held no piospof fei tho miners cf a shorter working day. of better safety conditions and of increased wages, it would bo very gloomy, and we should have concluded that we had arrived at the end of a cul de sac and beyond that wc could net goe ;Therefore, selfishly wo have to look on tje industry and ask ourselves&apos;.   Is this an industry which is elastic enough and expensive enough to give in the future to us what wo hope to enjoy ?   That is our way of looking at it; that is, in the narrow aenso, as to its effect upon us.    Wo see no prcspo of the industry-becoming ever expanding unless something very different happens from what has happened hitherto; fcr example Avhen we had our advance in wages a little while ago under the Interim Report of Mr, Justice Stankey-, and we had our reduced working day to 7. hours on 16th July, we were faced with a statement made by Sir -Auckland Geddes in the House of Commons that that had absorbed the whole of the profit that had been made in the industry, and, en the output he had calculated, would leave a deficit of  16,000,000 c used dirootly by tho increase wages and the reduced hours that we had obtained.
-    MTherefor^ if thera is any further advance in wages, or. any further reduction of hours, in fact if the very rodustion in hours contemplated by parliament should come to us in the year 1981,- if that is to oomo to us thon olearly unless- semething very materially different exists from what exists now m oannot have it unless the Uation is plnngsd into a further deficit in addition to the  46; 000,.000.&apos; So that the industry does net appear to be expanding under its present administration, and there does not appear to be any hope for us in the in-dustry unless production increases.The Prime Ministers      It was expanding up to 1914.Mr Hodges;.     Exactly.   That is what I was cdming to in a moment.   If it does not expand from now on very materi-ally, then it becomes a burden upon the nations   That is exactly what we want to avoids   I do not know whether you credit us with that feeling, but I can express it as quite a sincere feeling on the part of the miners. They are anxious not to have tho mining industry subsidy-dised out of the. Exchequer.   Therefore we look around us to see If some nss system of administration and con-trol cannot be devised by which production can be in-creased and the industry expanded^ so that in common with tho rest of the workers as tho industry develops we shall have still further increases in wages or further reduction in tho working day.low, Sir, in the year 1913 output was esti-mated - there are different figures, &quot;bat it is generally acoepted to have been 237,000.000 tons. I soc by last wsekVs Return, tho Return for September 27th, that tho weekly output for that week was, roughly, 4,500,000 tons. That worked out over tho year would give you approximately 234,000,000 tons*   That is 53,000,0^0 tons below the
1913 output. If that output were maintained that would give us, roughly, for tho year, 234,000,000 tons, I should like to say in passing that the figures of   the last five or six weeks havo shown decided improvement over the figures of the four weeks prior to that, and in so far as that is true the estimate&apos; of Oir Auckland Geddes was wrong, as I think Mr Haftshorn indicated that they would he wrong, if these figures wore maintained alono for the next 12 months, his estimate for July 1920, I think, was 217,000,000 tons.   That is the ffcgure upon which he based the 6s. increase in the price of ooal to the oommunity,inland sales.Now we tried to find out, and the Commissiontried to find out, what wa3 tho causo of this declining output; and I think it con ho said with a oertain amount of fairness that they tried to investigate fully the causes of the declining output.   There are physical causes, technical causes.   If you will pardon me for a moment I want to refor to tho Report of His Majesty1s Minos Inspector, Mr   w. walker, just issued for the^ear ending 1918.   Mr Walker refers to tho physical causes whioh havo contri-buted to this rom&amp;rkable decline in output, and he says;&quot; In any reconstruction such works as those will have to be undertaken; many of the airways will need considerable attention, and the condition of the tub roads and haulage roads requires to bo improved, repairs on these having in many cases been necessarily cut down to the minimum during the war.   At some collieries whole districts were closed down so as to concentrate the men remaining in smaller compass; to reopen these districts will curtail a considerable amount of work and expense.   Comparatively little use has boon made of girders on the main and other roads owing to tho difficulty of obtaining adequate sup-31.
I lice of steel, the result being that timber bars have been inrut/in many places whoro girders ordinarily ought toan:l wou ft have been used; these will need to be replaced. Considerable renewals of rails, both on the main mechanical haulage roads and on tho branch and horse roads are also required as these have in many eases got into poor condition and are practically worn out.       The number of tubs in use needs to be largely increased as, owing to shortage of mechanics and difficulty in obtaining material for making tubs, many collieries are very short in this respect.      Electrical cables will also have to be renewed to a considerable extent, partly by ordinary replacements in consequence of deterioration and partly in order to cemply with the requiremnets cf the general regulation. On the surface new boilers will be required to replace many existing rnes which are now almost worn out and to pro-vide additional steam powors-for development,      liany ropes, both for winding and haulage, also need to be replaced by new ones, in addition to which spare ropes - many places at the end of the war had not one spare rope - should again be provided in readiness for emergencies..   As re-garda safety lamps much difficulty has been experienced in obtaining new lamps, and also renewals such as glasses and gauzes.       It is important that many, of the older lamps should be replaced as early as possible, and that the whole of the lamps in use be brought into&apos; strict ccmpli-anoe with the safety lamps Order without delay&quot;,.    Those-are the material causes which His majesty&apos;s Acting Chiief Inspector of Ilinee, has proved from reports of his ownin-speotcre, have caused the reduction in        output.     V/e would like to have those causes remedied, and we think in the interests of tho Hation, apart from tho question of national-is at ion altogether, some steps midit be taken immediatelyc)2 c
to get these things remedied. But even so, if you improve the physical conditions under which men work, and improve these technical apparatus, that will not, in our judgment, bring the industry up to a point of commercial security - a point at which it becomes self supporting. That is the stage we want it to arrive at, the stage when it becomes economically self supporting, and that can only be made possible with a restoration of the pre-war output, because not only have we to restore the pre-war output to get back to the pre-war position, but we should have to improve it because of the advances in wages that have gone on since the pre-war position obtained.

I have just been looking through the figures, in the pre-war period, although they had this big output of coal of 287,000,000 tons in the year 1913, I find that one-third of the owners produced two-thirds of the total output, and their average profit was in the neighbourhood of 2s. a ton, whilst two-thirds of the owners produced one-thirds of the output with an average loss of 2s. per ton. So that with the advances that have accrued in the price of materials and advances in wages and reductions in hours, we should really have to have a much higher output than 287,000,000 tons if we want to restore this old position which, I think you will agree, was far from satisfactory.

Now, how is it to be done? I think Mr. Justice Sankey in his Report has indicated very clearly what he thought were the defects and the remedies which should be put into operation to put those rights. I could not do better than just refer you to them. They are very well stated, in fact so well stated that Mr. Smillie, Mr Herbert Smith, and myself, in conjunction with Mr. Sidney Webb and Sir Leo Money and Mr. Tawney, agreed substantially with all that Mr. Justice Sankey had to say, On page

  
10 of his. Report ho snoWa in &quot;Reasons for St. te ownership of Ooal Lines&quot;, what changes ought to take place in oral or to restore tho Industry to one of Independence.   In your speech in the House of Oou,nons, Sir, in Sealing with chic mat tor -I -cried to follow you very closely there   you rather made a point that on one or two essential mutters wo did not agree with I.:r. justice Sahkoy, and you . referred particularly to that point in connection with tho strike clause,   in n.r*justice Sankoy:s heport he sayo- &quot;f ho contracts of employment of workmen shall embody an undertaking to bo framed by tho District Mining G council to the ofxeat that no workmen will in consequence of any national Oispace join in giving any notice to determine his contract, nor will he combine to cease work unless and until the quo scion in dispute has boon before the national Mining council&quot;, - That was Lr* Justice Sankay!s clause0 V.&apos;e said on the other hand  &quot;Whilst fully recognising the necessity of working rules cuu the importance of preventing unnecessary stoppages, we feel that the provisions of paragraphs 50 -wad 54, and so on, may be used to impose upon the - orkersby law a particular form of contract without their consent, an innovation to which we think it will be difficult to obtain agreement and which wo think will be not best calculated to obtainthe object&quot;. is the only point,except for the point of compensation of royalties, that we differ from Mr-.justice San^ay upon i** hiu Ioiim list of remedies for tho mining industry. And, sir, wo would like to say hero the reason why we put .in that objection to which you made reference is that we feel that when the iwistriet Lining council a come to be set up, if you are ever to have anything liisc effective control and discipline in the districts and at tho collieries, you must in the first place secure a measure of consent on the part of
the workmen to the rules/you are go in;., to sot up.Onoe t.,at measure of consent lias bean obtained., then theauthority such as the [District mining Council, or the fitCouncil, wnichever makes tho rules either xor the districtor ..01  uiio pit, oar. use its authority to see that thoserules are carried out,     There must be something likoconsent in the contract which we tuoujit hr Justice 3aakeyhad not mads provision for,   7e. are rmraious, aril in factI believe every member ox my .&quot;h:ocutivo would agree, that under this scheme suggested by h.r Justice fiaukey strikesshould, not break out irregularly, that there should benone of these spasmodic stoppages; in fact wo believethat with a measure of consent on the part of tho v/orkmento regulations that would govern their contract you wouldeliminate to a very large degree   I will not say alto-gether   the possibility of these spasmodic stoppages.hut we dp not iguite accept the view .,-.at&apos; it ought to bea part of the existing lav; that when a man wont to hiswork he could not under any consider at ioin come out on strike., alsof v.. will/notice,. Sir, that the three reports areunanimous on the distributive side of the industryB     Eventhe owner3  aid Sir Arthur Duckham hold tho view that it isin the interests oi the community that local authoritiesshould have statutory powers to purchase and sell coal,,,All u.re agreed that some change Is required there,   you could only nave that arrangement oa ^rry valuo ii it wereupon a national basis..     If   &quot;our local authorities are to be purchasers of coal., ...nd sellers -.i coal, it must not be on c local plan,, but on a national plan., gust as you delegate certain powers now to local authorities,, but they aro gen----rally of a similar character right throughout the whole of true areas.   So tha , these three groups on the Commission saw that some sort of ?e-vi&amp;itAn^wout was necessary there in the interests of the rubric.   They could see - and the figares were obvious      -that all the way from the pit down to the consumer there were elements of waste creeping in which made it much more arrp-o.intensification.ve for the consumer to get his coal., and they r^oiiimnoridod   some par dally, others more comploUiy   that that should bo remedied ml a i-;...tional system for the purchase and sale oi coal for inland  air ;oaes should be acLowted,. .  .
:\&apos;ov; I would jur,t Hire to deal with the way we regard increased production&apos; in th- industry.   I said that there remedies suggested by Mr   alker are physical remedies.. - Thoie suggested by ::r* Justice Sankoy are both physical and moral remedies.   V;o agree entirely with the phyoical remedies but &apos;;e think the moral remedy ir of much more value than the mere physical remedy, I do not hold the view thet physical remedies of&apos; there defects will bring the output up :-o anything like the pre war standard.   Has this point of view that I am about to put been the subject of discussion amongst you?-- the point of view of thir desire on the pert of men to have a cert of different motive in their work than they have got now.   If you wero to go up end dorm our districts and get to our collieries you would find that the thing that marie the collier most unhappy in his work war just the fact that he had no voice in his work.   He waritr;* to have.a voice in his work,   vhen I say &quot;the collier&quot; I do not mean merely.the ran who hewr coal at the coal face. I believe everybody in the district, even in itr conmer-cial aspects, wants a voice in his work.   It would not be a proper suggestion for me to put that the miners who cut the cool should want to interfere in the co vetnsial work at Cardiff.   That would -not&apos;be &quot;their qphere, but the men engaged in the selling of the coal in the offices, at Car-diff ere I. think just sbout &quot;in the same position as the miners *   They want to have hone sort of voice in the work they are undertaking.   That is the great thing that Mr. Justice Sankey made provision for.   Me said in his interim report what I consider to be a very profound truth.   He said: &quot;We are prepared further to report novr that it is in
the-.....interest a- of^h^Jourrt^^t^t&apos;^-^ry^j^x^er^iky^^shall in the future have an effective, voice in the direction of the mine.   Por a generation the colliery worker has been educated roc icily and technically.   The result is a great national asset.   V;hy not use it?&quot;The j.-&apos;rimo V-inlster:   Th5.n is o very inportant point.   Hov/ much more voice would the actual working miner have in the control of that particular pit under Nationalisation than he would have under/ say, Sir Arthur I)uckha&apos;m&apos;s scheme? Mr. Hodges.   That is a question which I thin&apos;- must be answered in this way.   The scheme hangs together as a whole.   You have fcfiTe-^afcionallA5!-&quot;*&apos; Mining Council, the District Mining Coun-cil and the Pit Council,.   Tho rational Mining Council ---end I think we mufit always look at this machinery for the National Mining Council as - achinery capable of elasticity; I think it is wrong to imagine that you can think out all the details of a great scheme of administration in advance   The Prime Minister:   Do you suggest that the miners shouldhave a majority on any of there Councils? Mr.Mr $o$g&apos;es:. -/Justice hankey has not.The Prime Minister;     That is what I mean.&apos;&quot;r. Hodges:     He start? by making the National Mining Council half representative of the mining interests, both technical avd manual, and tho other half comprised of representatives of the nation and the consumer.   Very well.   That would also be true under his scheme, and that is the scheme we are arguing.   That would bo true of the District Fining Council.   After the rational Hining Council hrd been set up what would follow would be the setting up of the District Mining Council.     On the district -lining&apos;Council !;r -Justice Sanlo-y proposes rather similar representation ---half representatives of the technical and manual workers
in. ViiB&apos; liKUTTtrv^nd-^he^other-- half&quot; Tropr^rreirrta tiv. j s of the Staoo and the consumer. but when you get to the Pit Couuo? 1&apos;.. you would have nothing like that sort of representation because the consumer, qua consumer, has no business in the pit at all.   That is, strictly speaking, the operators job, to work the pit - . the Pit Council. On that Pit Council will&apos; bo representatives of the manual workers in the various grades of their employment and also representatives of the technical staff.   They between &apos;thcm; under I!r Justice Sanl:ey;c scheme would run that particular mine in harmony with tho decisions of the DiswriM Mining Council who in turn would work out the decisions and regulations of the national Mining Council? So that under no scheme in which the-present shareholders   -have a determining voice can the miners have tho effective voice they could nave under Nationalisation, The Prime Minister:   Havo they any voice beyond a voice concerning the safety and health of the mine..  They have no o on1&quot; rolling voice in the management of the mine where thaw a*je working * Mr Hjagw,s*,    &apos;Under -Mr Justice Sankcy&apos;s report * The ?r,lme Minister     I am talking now of :.r Justice Sankey5 sMr Let us soe,Mr- Braes;   At page 15 it says you have ten members,   The thr se /ojfwl 3 ials, Manager, under &apos;:-lanager and so on are ex ahWi3LJW   the nen elect four by ballot and three are appoint-3d:ill another way, it gives nix to f&amp;t?t   That Is what we ask.      We do not ask for more than that.The Prime ?kkaister;   The miners representatives are in a minoritMr B&apos;W]3:   Yes,     We do not ask for more,Mr Hodges.   ar-i the control that they would exercise is not, as Mr S-mlhlLO puts it, to inter fare with the final responsi-
of the manager to act in a crisis which would involve the safety of the  line, but they would act with hiw and in consultation, with him to see that that particu-lar mine was worked and conform^&apos;&apos; to tlie generally accepted regulations Lai- down   y the District Committee for the governance of that mine.   But as I say we cannot put forward any hard and fast sot of proposals for aovorning this great industry in advance.   They must always be capable of elasticity and expansion ana modification with experience     But before you can h*-:i:i you must accept the. great underlying principle of the Snnkey report, and that is the removal of the influence of the shareholders from the control of the industry.   That is what he suggests, an&apos;I ho surgests t&quot;-at that should he done at once. That is why the ; incrs ;?ed-ration of Great Britai   passed its resolution at Kesnick which I sent on to you.   That resolution sums up I think the minors&apos; position in rela-tion to the Sanhey Report&apos;.   I will rood-it: &quot;That this Conference having notes  the political am&apos; industrial press re now beinawbroiwht to boar upon the Government with a view -to gettim, it ^0 ignore the recommendations of the Coal Industry Commission qad expressed in the reports of the majority of the&quot; Commissioners in the as cone stage of the Commissions word-, it therefore into ates to the Government that whilst the miners are not fully satisfied with the -Report of  r.

T/at is t   so;  they take the view that we all tyke, that there may be aetails in a scheme of administration with which wo do not quite

BOFAR LA&quot;&quot;&apos;:   I understood that the claim Which you presented to the sankey Commission was quite different from this from the point of view of the control of the mines.   If so, do you accept the sankey report as a substitute for yours,  or do you still desire your can ?MR, KOPOW-S:   This is how we view that,   We prepared our Bill and presentee it to the commission; it was submit tea by k*r. Straker to the Commission,   That went further than the Sankey Report roes, but the diffeaa-nce between our pro-posal and the sankcy Report is this,  that we would have waited for parliament to have introduced legislation to have completed nationalisation and prepared in advance for the time when nationalisation would have -;c become an accomplished fact, but the sankey Report says;   v&apos;e ask Parliament to pass legislation to acquire the mines in three years, but in. short I should like to have an exprri-mental period with my limited form of control as distinguished from yours so that at the end of three years the nation could judge whether your scheme of control was a better one to adopt than the one which the. Government have adopted. VR, BO MR LAW;   That is the answer.   You do not accept a3 a permanency the sankey roeommendation ?MR. BRACE:   V/e cannot accept a ay thin; as a permanency, not even this Government.MR, HOUGHS:   I felt you would make that point.   That is exactly what I have been trying to make clear all along,  that in any scheme for the government on a different footing of a
great industry&apos; youraust be prepared to be elastic in yourideas and to give opportunity for expanBlon-a.nd.^btarig-e--andmodification if you want to make it a success.   The man who comes here and says to you:   Here is a out and driedscheme which must secure absolutely all we say it securesis not saying what I think to be right.   He must be pre^-pared to modify the details of the scheme of organisationif he is going to make it a success,MR. STUART BUMING;   Does the question of permanency reallytarise.   You are not claiming that this scheme, assumingyou accept it, must stand for eternity, surely.MR, HODOirS:   I think your question brings us down to what I regard seriously a3 the substanco of our claims   If youhold the idea, sir, that the miners at this stage are &apos;hoping, as miners., as physical workers in this industry,absolutely and finally to control it as they will, yonmisunderstand us.   everyone of us who is trying to thinkout step by step our netft advances, is making provision notonly for the manual workers to come into this scheme ofcontrol but f$r everybody engaged in &amp;ae-industry to comeinto it.   It doe3 not matter to me, and I am sure it *does not matter to my - executive, what little function a man performs in the industry, whether he is a colliery alerk selling the coal at the docks or assisting in th sale of the coal at the docke6 or whether h^ is the manager at a colliery, soonox or later in unis industry these -people will have to have some avenue for expressing .  themselves.    -So that when wo say wo want control, we say th men who are engaged in the industry, technically and manually, desire control, but they can    only have effective control in conjunction with the nation, who will own the asset, and, because they own the asset,
must always influence the policy of that &quot;particular industry. The &quot;Prime-Minister:   You Bee it is not a question of-.Influencing&quot; it, it is a question. Of determining.   Who is to determine? 16 3t those who are engaged in working the industry , or is it the general public?   That is the point. Mr. Hodges:     Those engaged in working the industry must always have the decisive voice in the technical development of . the industry. -The Prime Minister:     That is in the working of the industry.Mr. Hodges:   In the working of the industry.   Once the commodities-dity is produced it is for the nation then to be represented on a Council or an authority which will get that par tic u-lar commodity to the rest of the community in the most economical way.&apos; -The Prime Minister:   For instance, who is to fix tho price?Mr. Hodges:   Under the Sankey scheme    The Prime Minister:   Under your theory of perfect nationali-sation you say those engaged in working the industry must have effective control.     Does that include the fixing of. the pri3e?Mr. Hodges:     Under,my scheme of a perfect system of organi-sation I could easily tell you who would fix the price.That would be a combination of industrial workers   repre-sented through their particular Unions.     They would fix the price for the coal;   but, whilst we are dealing with theandSankey Report,/we are in the Sankey Report stage for the next three years at least, and probably for a longer period, the authority who would fix the prioe for coal would be the National Mining Council, or it may be the District Council might fix the price of coal.   It might be easy for the South Wales District to.fix the price, for its export coal, while it might be difficult for Northumberland
to hove a voice in fixing South Y/ales prices.   But the-&apos; Sankey scheme provides that all prices shall be fixed after consultation with the hational.-.Iaining...Oo-aricil in com junction with the Ministry Of Mine8, and then that will be determined according to the circumstances of each par-ticular district, but prices will be co-ordinated in the National Mining Council.&apos;   I thought I would mention those things because they do differ in some details from our ovn ideas, but they are the Sanaey ideas which we are preparedto accept  1 that is the truth of it---- because webelieve that the three years period that Mr, Justice Sankey provides for will be an educational eeriod and the oommunity with us will see in that three years- whether there should nob bo an improvement upon the scheme. In, the interests of economy.   I think that is substantially all I need say on the matter, Sir. Mr. Hartshorn:;  I think it would be as well if you made it clear to tho Prime Minister that when you are talking of what your answer would be under the perfect system about the workmen in the trade fixing the prices, it is no part of our programme at present and no part of our conception at present.Mr. Hodges:     hiiat Mr. Lloyd George put to me was rather aproblematical question, which I answered. The Prime Minister:   I was wondering what was going to happenafter the three years educational period. Mr. Hodges:   That is not for any one of us to say here.   No one can look forward sufficiently cleverly and acutely for three years to say what is going to happen.   It stands to reason that after three years experience you must draw lessons from such experience that will help you safely to &apos;     get through the following three years.     That is all.
I&quot; f*Brace:   I fee 1 like apologising for addrea-ainq you, Sir, but it lu go important q, mafmer - --The Prime Minister:   Indeed it is very important, ao iinporta as any Minister cou&apos;J d pnasibly have to consider.Mr Draco: It is so important ana so far-reaching a matter that I venture to siHuiiii to you certain reasons wiry you should accept the vie-.-  of the hirers Federation.Now, Si&apos;r&apos;j do not attempt to reply to us upon something that is rot .   &quot;/bat we are here for is to ask you for the Sa-nkey Report / not &quot;for something; that miaht happen after three years.   It will be quite unfair for the Prime Minister to found a refusal upon an idea that wc may ask for n.one reform in some future year.   That is a perfectly legitimate thing for us to do&apos; if wo find by our experience that the scheme that we are hero asking the Government, to adoot is not the host scheme that mar be adopted for the industry.   But $ Sir. we are not there at all.   tfhat the Miners Federation and the Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congress are here to ask the Government to do is to honour their obligation and their pledge.   I would remind the Prime Minister^ and Mr Banar Law, that if they did not in explicit language, undertake to adopt the Sanmoy Reoort upon nationalisation by implication we *?ere led to the conclusion that if Mr Justice Sankey upon investigation found that a case could be made for nationalisation, the Government would honour tho findings of that Commission.Mr Sonar Law:    I have never been able to find any words of mine that bear that out. lir Brace:   You are much too careful-----The Pri.ee Liniste-:&apos;  That is a suggestion that I was net oo r?fulMr Thrace&apos;: I&apos;put it to you that you were much more careful, The Prime -Minister:   That is what I should expect.
Brnoe:   instead of quoting an implication I would quote an explicit pledge -given in the name of the Government. How, it Is a well-accepted canon of Parliamentary proce-dure that if a Cabinet hinister is put up to speak in the na...ie of the Government, any pledge he gives across the floor of the House of Commons is a binding pledge upon the government   &quot;hen the Bill was before the House in connec-tion with the Coscission on the 24th february,  the Rome Secretary was put up as the spokesman of the Government, and he said this:    &quot;It is a pure business proposition, and if it turns out on investigation that it is for the good of the country as a whole that the wines should be nation-alt sort, -that the woowle o-p the country would bo better off if the wines were worked under a nationalised system rather than under private ownership, then it is a good business proposition, and we should accept it.   The Government de-sir.? to %o into the matter to see if it ia a good business proposition.   If it is thit, I accept it.   IP -it is proved to be a national det airaent rather than a national advan-ta;?,3, then the Government will oppose it&quot;.   Yas, Sir, but who is to determine that?   You yourself as a Government came down to the House of Comoons and set up a tribunal for deter mini no that, a nd&apos; it was for the purpose of get-ting the House of Commons to adopt the  111* the Coal; Corn-mission So hero * tha* the Home Secretary stressed the argument that it was not fair to ask the Government to adopt a scheme of nationalisation without investigation. Give us, says he, in effect, investigation, and if the authority or the tribunal which we will put up to enquire reports that nationalisation is a rood whina for the nation, then v/e&apos; accent it.   Sir, I h*wve n-fver road a cl are r parliament-ientary pledge .,than that plwdge, and the Parliamentary Oowmitte:-; of tho Trade Union Congress, and the Ilinars
Federation Executive, core here to ask you to honour your pledge.   As a Government, honour your pledge.Now,, Sir, as to our rendering of Mr Justice Sankey1 s He port.   That do we mean?   What is our inter-pretation?   Adopt the principle of nationalisation is our interpretation.   Accent the principle to start with, we accept Lv Justice Sankey1s Report both in principle and detail.   &quot;Whatever say be against us we accept it.   We are so profoundly convinced that nationalisation is the one thing alone which can save this nation that, despite the fact that we disagree with many portions of the re-commendations of Mr Justice Sankeyj we accept them as a scheme upon which the mines of the future shall be worked. You &quot;athef startled me when you put the question to Mr Smillie and asked him if wo would prefer the old system&apos; to the scheme which you yourself, Sir. talked of in the House of Commons.   Mr&apos;Smillie says Yes, we would.   Yes, Sir, but do not allow yourself to cone to the conclusion that in that direction you are going to find industrial peace in the mining community.&quot;  You will neither find industrial peace, nor will you get the production.The Prime Minister: , I do not want any misunderstanding about that.   I think Mr Smillie understood me.   I know Mr Smillie was pressing for the Sankey Report, but I said, Assuming we could not see our way to accent t&apos; at Re-ue&quot;t, woul^ &quot;he prefer a continuation of th--- old system, or would he prefer some form of unification such as that proposed ay the Government, or by Sir Arthur Duck-ham;   and he answered explicitly that he preferred the old system.Lr Brace:   Yes.   &quot;There is no misunderstanding,, and 1&quot; will tell you why.   I di&apos;o not think you ought to ask us to accent a simgestion ouch as your Government has made,&quot; or such as Sir Arthur Euckham proposes, because you are-4-6-
ashing an organisation which has been established to defend workmen against the power of capital to take part in a movement which is most at-oncly entrenching and opeat-ing power for capital.   Therefore we say the scheme is one which a body constituted such as ours is cannot accept. But as a lover of my Nation and my country, I want to warn the Government., if I may do so with very great res-pect, that if they go bach to the old system they are u,v&apos; against a something which will absolutely ruin us. Really, after all, part of this movement is psychological   a good part of it.   The War has driven us 35 years at least in advance of where we were in thought in 1914.   The young men have thought deeplv, and, indeed, they are educated.   It is a mistake to think that miners are not educated.   They are   much better educated than I am. They have a clearer conception of the cost of production and its relationship to wages.   They have a full know-ledge now as to what profits the industry did carry and they think can carry.   Hcw can we ask these men, these intelligent men, to go back to the system of private ownership and control,, and to exhaust themselves in pro-due ing aoal when to the degree that they exhaust themselves .. they are adding not so much to the advantage of the Nation as piling up fortunes for private individuals?   Really., Sir, we are,right up against it,. whether we like it or not, and I should mislead my Right Honourable friend the Prime lainirter if I did not make it el rear to him that I khos1 no sharper road to industrial destruction than the road of aoins bach to the old system of private ownership and private control..   If we are aoina to have production, then we .mist have a system of piecework;&apos;   and if we are acirm? to haire a system of piecework, then we .uust have an inducement;   and the inducement must not only be one of
wages.   I think it was mr Kodges who put the view that there ic a real- ethical side to this question.   Our men have come +0 the conclusion that they are something in-finite ly more majestic than &quot;age-earners.   They have gripped a hind of soul-stirring.idea that human life is very sacred, and in the future industrial economy of this Hat ion they must have their part, not as wage-earners, considered as you consider an engine, or a horse, or one-? thin? else, but they must have their part as real,live, vital partners in the industry.   That is behind this ques-tion of nationalisation as -much as anything else, and if we do net have full regard to that we shall make 8 mis-tame.   If&quot;you went each to the old system of private con-trol and private ownership, you would have a day-wage svshhm in the minina industry,   They would all be down on day wages, and that very quickly, and then you would have no production such as you require to save the Ration. It is because of my knowledge of this problem, gained by myself and in association with my colleagues, that with them I come here and I say to the Government there is no way out.   You may tinker this thing, but there is no way. out but nationalisation.   The old system is condemned wholly and absolutely.   That is on record.   -Ve cannot go baom to that.   I do not think any Government dare pro-pose that we go back to it.   The scheme which the Prime minister suggested in mho house of Commons is fundamentally impossible.   It is wrona.   It is wrens on its basis.   It is wrong to ask us to co-operate to make capital more powerful than it is by a system of t ratification.   There-fore we are driven to nationalisation,    &quot;hat is there to be frightened at about nationalisation?   It seems -to me to be the natural outcome of the industrial development of this very enlightened race.    It fits in.   It appeals-50-
to ]ne as fitting in with the genus of this race.   Of coursetoy Right Honourable friend, in a very effective portion of hie speech in the House of Gordons, says: &quot;But how are you going to purchase these aiines? T.   I used to be frightened myself very much about this high finance, but since he has lured me into the paths of voting millions   Ivir Bonar Law especially   in a very short ti e I have come to the conclusion that this is not such a orofound mysterv as I used to think it wan. Kr Bonar Law:    It is easier to vote than to get it. mr Brace:   Yes, Sir, out, as I vie-&apos; it, we can take over the mines as a nation without finding any of these &quot;large sums of money.   It seems to me to be a perfectly simple proposition for the Government by Act of Parliament to say:   Shareholders of collieries will present thmr colli-ery share certificates, and in return they &quot;&quot;ill get   that most of us have   a Govern.-ent security certificate, and tlrey will have to be satisfied with the same rate of interest, which we pet1;   and I a::, bound to pay that in these days of paper money I see no difficulty about exchange.   I really see no difficulty about it&apos;.   But, broadly, whatever the difficulties are, I a.;, convinced that the Nation stands to gain. &apos;Sow, Sir, I co :.e to the question of effective control.   Ton have told us that &quot;-e shall have effective control, that if we adopt your scheme you vill ;?lv.e us effective control.   Why will you not give us effective con-trel under nationalisation?   If effective control on the part of Labour is right, under you&quot;k scheme, it cannot be wrong under nationalisation.  ,I therefore appeal to the Prime Miniate? not to allow his mind to be prejudiced. The Prise minister:   An effectiv: voice. Lxr Brace:   Yes, an effective voice.
The Prime Minister:   Effective control is a different thin?,.kv Brace:   I will make &quot;effective voice&quot; mean&apos;&quot;effective control&quot;, because we mean the sa..e thins;..The Prime Minister...   Stop a minute..   I want to know if by &quot;effective control&quot; you me arm a majority?Mr Brace:    No, I do not..   I mean an effective control or an effective voice in exactly the same sense as Mr Justice Sankey has outlined in this Reoort.   I mean that, and when we are saving&apos;that the peonle in the industry who Know the industry best ought to havo something to say and do in connection v-ith the working of the industry, I should, have thought that was a simple business proposi-tion that would. have appealed to the Government as right and fair.   It is no use sending men into the fining in-dustry, which is a highly technical industry, without know-ledge, and thirvK that they can manage it.   They may be ve*v fine business men in see othc&quot; walk of life, but no-one can rive you the coal production that the&apos;Mat ion - requires at a price that will enable other industries to live so well as the people in the industry.   Therefore, Sir, I do not want to labour the matter, but I simply say this.   First, we asa the Government to honour their bond. Secondly, we say that the old system stands condemned and cannot be resurrected;   that&quot; the scheme aroposed ay the Prime Minister in the name of the Government in the House of Commons is fundamentally wrong, v-rong in principle., and-we can have nothing to do with it.   The third position is that nationalisation being reco. tended by the tribunal which the Gove&quot;nmon* itself se* un to no this work,- there is no a n s &apos; e &quot; to t hi s applic a tic n w hi oh &apos; t e - va k e.I hope, Sir, that you will not take the fact that the Trade- Union Congress Parliamentary Committee and our-selves have co..e hero in such strong fo-,ce, fortified by
the resolution carried by that body, as any kind of th - eat to the Government,   After all, this nation is as much our Ration as it is the Government&apos;3 Ration, and we are as much interested in the welfare of the Hation, but we feel that in the face of this demand      I use the word in its full sense   this demand on the part of organised labour in this yea? 1919, the Govern ent cannot afford to treat as something indifferent a resolution carried by such a body. It is our considered judgment, net alone   that the miners will gain.   &quot;Je believe it win be better for the miners, but my colleagues and myself would jsot come here if we were convinced that our proposals meant an advantage to *ha miners at the expense of the State,    &apos;-e are convinced that, not alon^ will the miners advantage, but that the Nation will advantage, and we do not see any ans -er. to this re-quest that we are maaing.   &apos;&quot;e found ourselves upon the broad fact that nationalisation is a sound business proposition, both from the standpoint, of industry, and the Ration, and the Government is pledged as much as any Government can be bv the word of one of its Ministers put up to speak in the name of the Government, and we, therefore, say to the Government &quot;Honour -our bond&quot;.
Mr.Smilli.0; ! ^ ** word, or. -two before you reply, Sir,I do not know whether you had in your mind, when you put thequestion to Mr.HodgcQ that tho miners are endeavouring toset up a state of matters in which they would under a systemof syndicalism take over the coal mines of this Country and   ox*lthem for the Minors..   There has been u good, deal of talk in ho newspapers about that.   If there is anything of that kinain youfr mind when wo speak of having a voino in the controlof mines you may rid yourself of it at once.   The minersFederation have no such thing in their minds,   v. he the r it willbe the same system 8q, So or 4q yeurt nonce .... v* not know.It will probably be a. higher system than, we are aiming&apos; at atthe present timo, but wo have no dosire to tako over the minesof this (jountry and to work them in the interest of the Minersalone.   ,to do not think the Minors are entitled to take overthe mines and work them entirely in their own interests,   when mr.Juotioe Sankcy sa^s.: &quot;effective control&quot;, x do not trJUi.-. hemoans by that that tho miners alone are to have the prodominantvoice In control.   J do not think he meant it.   But i shouldliJ o you to remember what tho mine owners say. &apos; Tha^ say; &quot;Ifwo are not loft in complete control wo prefer giving tho minesover to the Hat ion and getting a f&amp;i$ price for them&quot;.   I do not like to quote aon every time to prove that they made a statementbecause sometimes all of us make statements that wo do not care to face afterwards, but I thin^ I ought to quote mr.sonar haw,-J have a great deal of dependence on his word if he&apos; says a thingand at page 31 of the interview wo had on tho ^othUiarch, he says this; &quot;If thic Commission is to continue&apos;&apos;        that v.aa fox- .....its Second setting ---- &quot;interim reports which
in ordinary oiroucstanoos might ho thrown   into the- waste paper basket.t but it is part of tho Government1 s undertaking to deal with those reports in the spirit as well as in the letter&quot;-, Lir.Badges and I had U.....t statement, our Executive had it, before wo advised our people to accept the report, and largely on that We wont and advised our people to accept the report.   Vic stood for two hours on the platforms to got our people to accept this report and we said: Mr.Bonar p^w st^s that interim reports will bo issued: thoy will hot .bo thiewn into the waste, paper basket: the,/ will bo .,ocupbou by tho Government in tho spirit and in the letter.   la tho House pi Common KroBanar Luw said this; r&apos; &apos;his proposal, as I ho.vu said, is u very ambitious one.   In re.aa.rd to this whole report wo have had it discussed at the Cabinet this afternoon, and I ^ noa on behalf of the government that wo are prepared to adopt tho fopart in the spirit as well as in the latter and to take all necessary stops to carry out these recommendations without delay:,c   I did not mention to you Sir, that Lr6Justice SaakayTs report deals with the housing question and it deals with the question of washing.at the colliery.   To my mind tua hGUL.i.ue question t.uu washing at the colliery, I was almost going to Say, were of as much, importance? as nationalisation except that under nationalisation they would immediately come.    Sevan months ago Mrojustice Sankoy and his Commission went to the Locul- Government Board and to the Scottish Office about the HvU&amp;.iu  question,   pe were told six or seven -months ago that bricks were being maoo, and that they, had&apos; set aside all the labour of the duuntry and they would begin rSmmz-tiutclj&quot;on the housikng question,   Nothing has been dope yotand two or three families-are living in one house in many mining districts^ ...lathing has boon done yet with, regard to
washing at tho collcrioc.   I sincerely -hope that yon will oo: your way to to able to give&apos;a satisfactory reply to this demand of ours., -Mr Bonar Law    I fo.,1 that it is only right that I should deal with what Mr Smillio has said,-and I am very glad to have tho opportunity of doing it, for as he has boon good enough to&quot;say he thinks I world not soy anything I did not moan, I am convinced ho would not put an interpretation on my words if he did not think they bore that intorpreta-tionMr Smillio;,   No, I would not.l;ir Bonar Law:    I will tako first what I said to yOur Doputa tion and which you quote as binding   my-promise to&apos; take the interim reports&apos;and deal with them not as w&amp;sto paper but in the spirit and in tho letter. Mr Smillio: . That was at our interview here Mr Bonar Law:   Yes,I havo got it,   I dealt in the earlier part of my statement with two things, with nationalisation and with these interim reports which nobody knows bettor than ivir Smillie did not refer to tho tig subject of nationalisation but to those improvements such as housing and clearing tho pits and all the rust of it,     I dealt quite- separately with thorn.   As regards nationalisation I say this ----- and this is all I say abort nationalisation   &quot;first of all on tho question of nationalisation, I know you attach, I believe at least you attach, as&apos;much importance to that almost, if not quite, as to improving your, immediate conditions *   &quot;oil, kr&apos;Justice Sanke-y has undertaken to report on that within two months  a short time-  and it will bo a report by neople -vho have- shown that they&apos;arc not unsympathetic to the miners&apos; demands&quot;. That is all I said that could bind ma in any Way on&apos;nation
alisation.     Than I go on to deal with the question of hours and then I say w In a dition to that I think it is hardly loss important to look at tho opportunity which Is given of Improving tho wholr? condition of your industry&quot;, and then I go on to the- r:-marks about the interim reports which were promised on all those things, and I gave a promise fcn behalf of tho Government that as the reports camo out they would be treated as executive, they would bo carried into offcot.     There never have boon any of thorn and therefore that cannot apply* Mr,3mlllio:   Whon you mado your statement in the House of Commons you had before you the interim report, and tho interim report said:   On tho evidence which we already possess the present system stands- condemned; and you say you accept that report on behalf of tho Government in the spirit as well as in the letter--- accept that statement, I take it.MroBonar-Law:    That, as I understand it, is an entirely different case.      It is my pledge bocauso I accepted the interim report, not because I promised to accept a subso-quent report.    All there is in that is this, that the existing system stands condemned and must bo replaced in some s&amp;hxK way or another, as Mr. Justice gsnkoy said, either by control or by nationalisation; and the proposal made by the Government in tho speech of tho prime Minister dig endeavour to deal with it in the secpnd of the alternatives suggestec5, I hope you will look into this yourself because I do not like, and I am sure you would not like, charges of breach of faith to be mado if, as I know, they ore not intended andIf the words do not beer them out. Mr. Smillio:    I would not for a moment and I know you would not endeavour to put a thing in such a way as to mislead us, but you may take it from me that we believed that&apos;if we went on with the Commission and got a report In favour of national!-sat ion you were pledging yourself and Mr.- Lloyd George was pledging himself that you would bo prepared to carry it out,IT- Bonar Law:   I am sorry; I certainly did not Intend it.
after a short interval:- .W rjHISTER:   It Smillio and gontlemon, the subjectLoh tliis very important deputation has brought to the notice of my oolloaguegand myself is as important and as diffioult a problem as any Government could be confronted with.   It is not a question to dogmatise upon. I think oven the gentlemen sitting on the other Side of the table \vill admit that at best it is an experiment which, aa&apos; far as -I. know, has not boon tried on any groat scale in -any part -of the v/rrld, There was an eirporimont, I bolieyo, in Germany but it was abandoned at tho end of five years, and the only &quot;part of Germany vhore the orporimcnt was actually in operation was, unless I am mistaken, in the Saar^Valloy where the conditions were very peculiar. Certainly it was quite unnecessary for my friend, lir Brace, to aw peal to the Government not to treat tho or o &quot;Diem with indifference,   They certainly will not do that, apart from the fact that it has such powerful backing.   .;&apos;o &apos; &apos; -&quot;. ,have given great consideration to it.&apos;  &apos;./o have considered it for a very long time, aril looked at it in and out, and we have come to our conclusion after the most mature reflection. It is a groat economic question &quot;which affects the industrial, life of the nation in all its branchosV   I cannot think of any . industry in this country which would not be most intimately offooted by tho decision we come to.   Lr Smillie was quite right in saying that coal was tho industrial life of the nation, It is also a great political issue, And may X just say upon that subjeo that like every other political issue it is an issue that must bo dec it ed by tho nation as a whole.   It cannot bo decided by any part of the nation which does not constitute tho majority of the nation,   If the nation is convinced&apos; that it is ridit and
proper in t .e interests of the pooolo as a wholo that thisexperiment should, bo tried, tho nation has got a machine bywhich it can express its will, and not merely by which itcan express its will hut by which it can carry.its will into effective execution,,   Ilr Smillio says that the Trade UnionCongress have discussed this matter for at least 30 years.It is not truo0   There aro many euoctiono in which both hoand I have been concerned     some in which v/e have both been equally concerned&apos; somo in which he hasbeen more concerned than I, end some in which I have been more conoornod than ho, in which in order to mark thebeginning of the process of &quot;educating tho people you havo to. . of ago much fur ther back than that6 llr Brace knows iia&amp; question, in.which he and 1 have beon specially interested whore the beginnihof the process of educating the community dates as far-backas half a century ago. It has just materialised now,   that had not the same poweriul support, it is true,, as the proposal which we now havo under oonsideratione   The nation must de- .aide, this according to its own conscience and its own sense of what is right and fair aid beneficial to the community asa wholea But I would point out to. ilr Smillie that when itwas discussed 20 years, ago at the Trade Union Congress It;took then the form of a demand for the nationalisation.of the.minerals and of the mining royalties and not for the Controlof the mines. It developed, it is true, into a demand for..tho business management by the Stato of&apos;tho minos, but the-original demand was a demand for the nationalisation of the minor alsr eo cure 03 oft ho country and of the mining royalties,The Government can only state clearly what thoir view i3d if that is not. acceptable to the nation thoro are means by whichthe nation.can not merely carry out nationalisation but carry
the Government out , and that is a process which no one knowshew tc conduct more effectively than the gentlemen who are in front of me now   tho process of public education which enables themtc persuade tho vast majority of the people of this country of any reasonable proposition which they may have to submit to their judgment,How,, in indicatinf once more what the view of tho Government is with regard to this proposition, I will first of all examine the arguments advanced by Mr. Smillie and by subsequent speakore for tho nationalisation of the mines as well as of the minerals. I will come to the minerals separately.   There are two separate propositions.   One is the nationalisation of the mineral wealth, of tho country,;   the other is the actual management of the mines by the State as a business.     I draw a distrinction between those two,   I will take tho larger proposition, the nationalisation of the mines. in the sense of St ait e management and control of the business.    What are the arguments which have geeh advanced in favour of our undertaking that business?   The first is once which is dependent on the report of the Royal Commission.   It is suggested that wo have signed a bond as a Government to carry out sll the recommendations of the Royal Commission under all the headings of enquiry, whatever the majority, even if there is a majority of one: that the Government withoutnexercising any independent authority or independent judgment of their own are . &quot;bound to accept every recommendation, every plan, every scheme put forward by that Commission were it only by a majority cf ono; and that a failure to do so is tc dishonour our bohd* MR BRACK:   Nationalisation is the one I am concentrating on. -SHP PRIME MINISTER:   I do not know if there are any words In respect of nationalisation which would not apply to the whole cf the recommendations.     Now,- Mr. Brace,has a good deal
7 ioi experience or Parliamentary life ana of official life.   I do act know of any Government that has ever been in this country or in any toher country that has ever taken up that position   that they will refer a great question of policy to a Commission, quootions involving principle, questions involving the very industrial life of tho nation,, that they would abdicate their own judgment, that they will invite Parliament&apos; to abdicate its functions, at least to abdicate its independent judgment, aril that it will adopt tind put through with tho whole of its power,any recommendation mado by that Commission uoon a groat question of . policy, even if it wore only by a majority of one or two..     1 have never, heard of a Government that has ever taken uo that position.   I shall be very surprised if there ever is a Government in this country that takes uo that position;   at least I hope not.      Most of you gentlemen belong to a -?arty which is different from the one I belong to.     You are looking.forward to the oropect of assuming responsibility of Government yourselves,
I should bo very surprised if, when you coma to form a government, you oan possibly adopt that attitude towards- the He-port of a Royal Commission into any subject, that you may appoint.   Mr-.. Brace used the word &quot;tribunal&quot;.   A tribunal, I agree, is a body that decides an issue.   You arc bound to accept it, it is a court of arbitration..    Tho High Court of Justice is a&apos;tribunal.   And I can understand if it were purely a question of wages your treating a Royal Commission as a tribunal;   And we did so; we treated that part as if it wore a decision upon a question of fact whore Mr. Justice Sankoyrs Roport was a finding..    But when you come to a gigantic political and economic issue with endless ramifications, involving schemes and plans of working,, and the organisation-of an industry which is the basic industry of all the industries cf;the country, and say that you were referring to Mr., Justice Sankoy this question as if he were a judge giving a verdict and&apos;deliver-ing a judgment which the Government was bound tc accept,, which Parliament was bound to accept, which the whole country was bound to accept, that is a doctrine which seems to me to be of so swooping a character that I cannot imagine anyone with a sense of responsibility accepting it.let me point out exactly what the finding of Mr. Justice Sankey was or, rather, let me point out to you the.conditions&apos; of the finding.     Mr/ Smillier in a very fair speech      nothing could have boon fairer,, if I may nay so, cr more convincing than the way in which he presented his case   said that there were six members of that Commission who represented the public;   that is, there wore three whe represented the coal owners, there&apos;were four-, was it, who represented tho miners ? MIL BOIAR LAW:   Throe.MR, FRANK HODGES: . There were three of cache
IdTHE PRIMS MINISTER:   Very well;   those represented, one tho employers and the othor the workmen. Tho other six represented the public.   But may I point out that three oil them wore pledged, earnest, and very able advocates of nationalisation ?   Two of thorn hardly could conceal., the fact   woll, they did not conceal the fact that-thay wore advocates, and they wont into tho box to give evidence for nationalisation,     I think that is quite a precedent,ifRa SKILLIE&apos;   You appointed thorn;   thoy were yours...THE PRIMS   MINISTER:   I did; I am open to that criticism I quite agree; but if I could have conceived that two Royal Commissioners appointed, to investigate a question,in what I, understand they at. any rate thought was a tribunal --a tribunal,, not a commission but a tribunal--r to ascertain a fact, to decide a thing judi-cially, would have ^ons into the witness-box and then, having passed first of all from tho bench to the witness-box, returned, from the witness-box to tho bench to decide upon the quality;and the merit of the evidence, they themselves had given ----MR., PRANK HODGES:   It has a precedent. .THE PRIME MINISTER: : I am sorry to hear it; : I do not believe itwill have another.. MR&apos; ERANK HODGES:   Yos;   the Archbishop of Canterbury did it in1906.Tim IhallLE MINISTER; . V/hat was that, about-?MR, FRANK&quot;..HODGES-; . On the Ecclesiastical Commission.THE PRIME MINISTER:,. Oh, woll I - But I mean our judicial business, . You had.throe of them, powerful, out.-and out advocates.   There-were.only four men there who had never expressed an opinion one way or the other and who had an open mind on the subject.- . Mr..,. Justice Sankey certainly had an open mind on tho matterthere is no doubt about it;     Sir Arthur Puckham certainly had.an open mind on. the subject.   I know ho. had; . Sir Allan .Smith. -
had an open mind on the subject and Mr. Balfour had an open mind on the subject. They had never expressed an opinion one way or the other. They had never concerned themselves in politics, out of the four, who were then? representatives of the public and who had an open mind on the subject three of them were against it and only one for it. Well, I am ? to point that out. If you had had a commission - let us speak quite frankly - where men of that kind, men whom we know were not pledged other one way or the other, who had perfectly open minds on the subject and representing the trades and industries of this country had all come to that conclusion, then you would have in an infinitely more powerful position than you are when simply claim that Parliament and the Government should abdicate their functions of an independent judgment on to findings of a Royal Commission upon practically one voice in that Commission - a very powerful one, a very able, and one which I have the very deepest respect for.

In regard to Mr. Justice Sankey, nothing that has been said will alter my mind about the upright character of this great Judge, for he is a grant Judge, and I deeply deplore the criticisms that have been passed upon him. They have been thoroughly unworthy, and it makes it very, very difficult to get men of his distinction to undertake great national tasks in the future when comments of that kind are passed upon them because men happen to differ from them. It is most unworthy. But let me give you reasons which Mr. Justice Sankey gave for his decision.

Listen to the reason; it is the reason assigned by Mr. Hedges: Many of the workers think that they are working for the capitalist and a strike becomes a contest between labour and capital. This is much less likely to apply with the State as owner, and there is fair reason to expect that the relationship between labour and the community will make an improvement upon the relationship between labour and capital in the coalfield". Well, I might


conceivably have thought so three weeks ago; I don&apos;t want to refer to ? which are closed, but they are printed pretty deeply on the public memory. There never was a mere inopportune moment for pressing the claim for nationalisation than the present ?

MR CHILLIE: It is most opportune.

THE PRIME MINISTER: I am talking from the point of view of public opinion, There never was a mere inopportune moment for pressing the claim for nationalisation than the present moment. Here we had the most dangerous labour dispute with which we have ever been confronted, a fortnight ago. It was not a dispute between capital and labour; it was not a dispute where private profit was concerned; That was the dispute which is referred to by Mr. Justice Sankey as one which will not happen if you nationalise the mines. It was a dispute between labour and the community.

MR STUART-BUNNING: That was not the view of the men. It is only right to say that was not the view of the men, and that should be borne in mind.

THE PRIME MINISTER: I have seen the men a good deal and there is no doubt at all that it was a dispute between the Government, representing the community and a Trade Union, representing men who were working for the State; Every penny-piece that you put on to wages went straight on to the community, either in the form of taxation of of railway charges. The decision was a decision of the community through the Government. You had all the conditions of nationalisation; the railways are in the control of the Government at the present moment, and the cost came directly out of the pockets of the community.

MR STUART-BUNNING: But because you were able to deal with it as a national matter you settled it. If you had not been able to deal with as a national matter you probably would not have done.

THE PRIME MINISTER: Yes, but how did we settle it? We settled it after nine or ten days - I think perhaps I had better not


go Into that;   I think I would rather not, especially at thy resent moment.    I think it is undesirable to an into it if you do not mind -Mh. STUv^-BUHHIMG:   &apos;nite.TH3 I,&apos;;I10 I&amp;IKIm73?i ;   I do not want to say anything -hich will create any sort of bitterness at all.     It r.*as settled, and riQ ;..re all very grateful for that,, and I may sav at once that I cannot tell you hen thankful I ::n at tho present moment that it was settled without any bloodshed fhear,-hear). But &quot;rith that in our minds the public is less in the temper, in tho disposition,, in the atmosphere, to consider favourably that argument than, it over was, and when you have got that in reference to the only argument usef by the one man who constitute? tha majority for nationalisation;-  by the one Independent n-- n who was unpledged and who declared for nationalisation -- I say r,hen you find that his sole argument is snepenoc&apos; by a great strike against the 3to to shortly afterwards,, it makes it very, very difficult to wive the same weight to that argument js one -rould have clone, oven a few months ago...l\w let me say this at once.     Mr.. Smillie quoted something which I sairl &quot;bout tho miners.-   i&apos;ot a word of that do I wish to withdraw;   I repeat&apos; it with pride, because I come from .n part of the country where the mining is on tho whole the most.important industry, and we are all proud of our miners..    And if I coma to this conclusion, it is not because there is any lack of confidence in tho miner;   it is simply because the mines are something which concern even more than any ordinary industry,.overy other industry in the State. .   That is why I have got to look at it from that point of view..ftow I pass over the pledges.    Neither Mr.. Brvcff nor, I
think, Mr. Hodges, nor Mr., Smillie., who mentioned,pledges,      i could quote anything from-either my collongue who loads the House or myself which control to regarded as a pledge.     I do not take the vie&apos;// that the Home Secretary1 s is the equivalent of a pledge.     Tnrre is only a suggestion that by implication we led the miners to believe that whatever the decision of the Tribunal by even the slightest majority, we would adopt it.     I regret if they should take that view of the matter, because I&quot; cannot accept that.     I could not accept it with reference to any Commission under any circumstances, except purely on the question of a finding of fact, like, for instance, the decisions about wages, and hours, vhich were very largely in the same category, and we have accepted and carried out both of them.Now I come to the merits.     This is so important a matter that I make no apology for taking up some of your time.   ; On the merits it has been suggested that if you nationalise the mines you save expense.     How would that save axpense?   You would save expense by the process of an if icatior.. but that is common to any proposal cf unification,,    You certainly will not save expense in wages.     I have already referred to one experiment   in nationalisation which has increased the expenses enormously.     I do not say that you would not have had the same increase in expenditure if the railways had remained under private control, but at any rate it has not saved expense in that respect.   &apos; I,am told that the output would increase.How ^ill it increase?   I will come to Mr. Smillis&apos;s point later-on, about what would he gained by the nationalisa-tion of minerals.     It is said that tho worker would work better;   he &apos;Tou.ld work better if he knew he was working for the State thvn if he thought he was working for share-holders.     I do not believe you could point to any case where men ^ork better for the bt&apos;?te than they &quot;-ork for syndicates not one.     The Stote is ** very great employer of labour,     It is-o I-
an employer of labour in the Post Office, anc1 in tho Dock-yards,.     $municipalities in their communal ownership owngigantic industries, but I do net think you can point to asingle case whore it can be said that workmen   or king forthe commune, either the local commune or tho national one,work more heartily, work harder rr increase the output in comparison with their follows silo are working for a syndicate -not one. *rIB,, SMIL1I3;   Yes, the Glasgow trans are-.

I will come to that later on, but control is a different matter.HSR9 SUfRAKSR:   It has to bo considered separately.A H3PKBSUNTaTIVE:   1 hat about the war, and the soldiers?THET H1IMB MIKISTBR:   Yov( could not run, a war on a system of private contracts, end I do n^a think you s as famine that.     ?here are a groat m ny things I cbuld,have uai i about that, but I do   not wish to.MR.

So that in regard to machinery, I do not know that they would he more likely to encourage its introduction under a scheme of nationalisation where they had control, especially if they had effective control, than they would if yon had the present private ownership of the mines.The other clement, which is a very important one in output undoubtedly is the reduction in tho hours of labour, which has had the effect of reducing th; output.     The third is also one which &quot;/as pointed out by Mr. Hodges, the many defects in machinery and In organisation which are attributable to the v&apos;ar, the fact thai during four or five years the manufacture and the engineering of this country has been concentr ted upon war material, Bnd thot therefore to a very large extent the mines have suf&apos;1&apos;orod through laca of repairs in their machinery, laox of improved machinery, vnd rlso of locomotives.     &apos;a\hat undoubtedly ic a contributory c.nse in -/our estimate of the causes for the reduction in the output.     ill these things undoubtedly will improve in the course of time.The other was referred to by Mi, Smillie rThen he s-id that caving to the f -ct that you hed a largo number of owners of the eame seam of co-1 in the same coal tree, you found it was quite impossible to work your seams economically, th?t yon find barriers remaining that oueht to hove been worked out.     That is perfectly true.     I have no doubt at all that that has been a very serious contributory causa of the uneconomical working, of the mines, and he micht have pointed out, as he anor&apos;S from experience, a good m ny other fact re which inure from tho p.- iv-te ownership of minerals, and &quot;ihieh ire disastrous to tie economic al working of th r- coal mines of the country.     Th t is undoubtedly     very are at and a vary commanding argument for tho n. tion-liaation of the minerals, so t&apos;a -t you should be able to work upon some, sort of businesslike basis one of the minerals oi this country..
Whatever-anyone, may ^hink about i;he^..^ ofbusinesses, I am not quite sure that mines afford the best subject for an experiment of that kind.     It is a risky business;    it is a highly speculative business.   Mr.  milllo--pointed out that you may have in one area a mine which is paying huge profits and you may have in the same district, mines that are working at a loss;   there Is a differeaao   -between one district and another, and. Ms idea, oo far as.I oould grasp it, was this, that the pioiitable mines should be used to enable the State to carry on at a loss the mines that were unprofitable.MR. SMILLIB;   If they thought It wise to carry them on.THE PRIME MINISTER:   I am not going to dwell upon that, but in order to deal with the next point I read very carefully this morning Mr. Smillie&apos;s speech to the Trade Union. Congress.   He pointed out that before you develop a coalfield you bore, in order to discover whether there is ooal there or not. That is quite true-   You may discover thoro is coal there, but that is no guarantee that you will be able to find coal * there in paying quantities*MR. SMILLIE:   Oh, yesITHE BRIME MINISTER:   No.SMILLIE:   Yes,   Pu can get the whole section of the seamiTp PRIME MINISTER:   Well, that is not tho experience of a good many people who have sunk pits and have discovered that they cannot make,them pay.     There are so many conditions.   I am not going to enter into an ar^Mj^ht with you;   you have a practical acquaintance with these matters which I do not possess, but I do know from personal contact with men who have made experiments of this kind that sometimes those experiments turn out to be profitable, sometimes   they turn out to be complete failures, and the abandoned coal pits, which you will see here -2nd there about the country, demon-strate that...MR,. STRAKER:     Hot with the present boring apparatus, because eve-71-
inch is got now with the present boring apparatus.MK. SMILLIE:   There is not g per cent of the collieries that have been abandoned from that cruse,MR. STUART-BUI1I1ING:   A good aai y collieries .that are abandoned ore abandoned because they are worked out and not because they ore failures.   &apos;L&apos;]R, B01IAB LAW:   I know many people in Glasgow who have made failures by sinking pits.THE PRIMS MIRISTSRi   And in South Rales too.    1 want to point this out, that the private owner can go on developing and he can ta.ee risks;   it is his own business, but if a State Department does it you ;mow what happens if thdtfO is a single failure.   The successes are never recorded;   nothing is ever said about them.   If you have a j/reat success   something which is a success in the management of a State Department   that is never referred to in the newspapers, because it is not good copy.    It is the failures that make good copy.   You might have a great State Department with an extraordinarily able Mining Minister;   he might have a number of collieries which he had developed.and they had been great successes, but one day he developed one, let us say, at the cost of half-a-million or n million. -I do not know what the sum is that you spend upon these pits, but it certainly rune is to hundreds of thousands of pounds   and it fails, you would never hoar the end of it.   There would be columns about the way he had. been squandering public money.MR. SMIILIE:   He would already have set aside sufficient, as the mine-owners do now.TH3 REIMS MlihISTSR:   Yes, but they would then say;   &quot;Look at all the money that this man1s predecessor set on one side as a reserve, but this bungler has spent it in a single year&quot;.MR, STUAPJI-BUIIIOIG:   But you do no o suggest that GovernmentDepartment do not o spavin:en b, da you?   I know myself, from my own experience, that the Peat Office has spent hundreds
of thousands of pounds on telegraphic instruments, ma.*y ofou which have been failures, and surely this is in the same category.THE PRIME MINISTER:   That is a different thing altogether.    That is purely a scientific experiment.MR. .STUART-BUSHING:   It is certainly tho same thing.THE PRIME.MINISTER:   No, this is not a scientific experiment, this is a business which you are running, and which must be /run for a, prof it.    If it is said that the State is not to make any profit or to pay its own way   as a matter of fact, the Post Office is not paying its own way now in some Departments.MR. SIUART-BUNNING:   Now, but you have had many millions out of us.&apos;in days gone by.THE PRIMS.MINISTER:    That shows that nationalisation will notbe a success to-day, whereas if you had tried it 50 years ago it would, have been a success.     But perhaps you will leave me to develop my argument in my own way.   I am only pointing out to you that in a highly risky business of this kind it is not the best ground for nationalisation that you can choose.MR. TR0,Tl ER;   But it is the lifo-blood of tho nation, iB it not?THE PRIME MINISTER:   Yes, certainly it is the life-blood of the nation, and that is why I want, if I possibly can, to see it circulating In the veins of the nation in a way that will create the greatest health.   I do not want it congested in one quarter.   Mr. 3 illie said that the price must be reduced, and I agree with him.    The price now is   -o*  high that it is a serious menace to the industry. MR. SMILLIE:   It is far higher than it need be. , THE PRIME MINISTER:    It is so   nigh that it is a serious menace to tha industry, and I will point out to Mr. Smillie In what respect it is a menace to the industry.     It is a serious menace to the industry because they have discovered for the.
first time&quot; that - - oil,. ij3.-che&amp;p c r &quot;-th arr&quot;hun3cr r&quot; t; o-al. VR. FILLIP:   That is so.THE PTiTM^&apos;)7:?!^:Hv^&apos;R&apos;    TThen you take into account not merely the price per ton- bat alao tho fact trat it is cheaper to handle and that it gives you more -.argo spacer   And now they are covertin-4 the greatest liners into   oil-burning ships  -----1T!R, SMIxiLX17:   Quite ridit, ;THE PRIME 1-Iat1STT&apos;1R:   I agree that the present price is a serious menace to the industry itself, and it is forcing all the great industries of the country- to consider the introduction of machinery that eaves coal      not a bad thing in itself, because, it cheapens production and from that point of viev, it is a good thing for the coimwu j t.y as a whole, but I do not think anything which forces up coal to such a high price as to.make oil a serious competitor is a good thing.   Therefore,- I : agree that it is desirable that you should reduce the price, but I do not sec:ho?&apos; nationalisation is going to reduce the price,  especially nationalisation with effective control given- to those, who are concerned in the industry.   I am afraid it v.i&apos;11 have exactly the opposite effect,  especially when you take into account that this is net a final machine.There is not doubt the slight majority given to the - community in Mr, Justice Sankey&apos;s Report&apos; :*s not accepted as tho final voice by the Miners&apos; Federation.   Mr,Hedges was quite frank about it,   There is nobody knows better than Mr. Smillle that that is not the idea that appeals to vast multitudes of the younger miners,   He referred to the guild theory, that is the theory which is popular with rnulti-tuccs of the younger miners, which is not the nationalisation of the mines, but what I would call the traaeification; that ;would be serious for the community, because the minerals areas a national property, and they ought to be worked for the benefit of the nation as a whole.hR. GT-ORGT7. &quot;BARKFR:   Hear, hear;   That i3 our case. THE IyRIME MINI ST&quot;FR:   vcs, they ought to be v^orkeu for the benefitr   74 -
of the nation as a whole, and the&quot;Gowernm**nt jpropc-se- that tho minerals should be nationalised, that they should be made national property.   The nation, therefore, will have the same control and will not merely Have the control which it has now, through control over the induntry, but it will have the additional control which the command of the mineral itself will,give,   wvcryono who has been working a mining area and knows how strict those leases are, -knows what tremendous power it is which is vested in the owner of the mineral.$ow I come to the next point, which is that a voice- is to be given to the miner in the control of the industry, insofar as health and safety are concerned.   The Government put forward proposals to meet&apos; that demand, also to meet the demand for unification; they proposed that you should unify the industry by districts.   &apos;&quot;;e agreed absolutely with every-thing that has been said,  not merely by Mr. Justice Sankey in his Repovt-, but by others, by Mr. Gmillie, by h:r. Houges and Mr, ^race, that unification produces increased efficiency, increased economy, increased output and a consequent deduc-tion in the expenses,, and we were prepared for unification. We put forward proposals for unification. &apos; Mr. Brace says those are proposals for strengthening the capitalist; let us examine them.   We propose that there should be Pit Committees, which would have a voice in the control of the mines 30 far as health and safety are concerned, but in the unification proposals we went beyond that and wo proposed that the miners should have representatives on the Board of Directors i   That jives- a much more considerable voice in the management,   How the placing of direct representatives of the mining industry or the mining workers upon a Board of that kind can strengthen the purely capital side I am at a loss to understand., They have got a Federation which, whenever there is any conflict between capital and. labour enables them to utilise /
the whole united strength for the conflict.   Why they should he stronger for n conflict with labour if they unite in districts I cannot understand.   I am not at all eure that they bru 2 not district Federations now, but I do not know about that.MR. BRACE:   Thoy have-not district Federations of capital, they are individual firms united.THE PRIME MINISTER:   No, they are more than that.     Ibelieve they have Federations which enable them to make a le.yy for the ptagose of supporting any colliery. That is so, is it not?SIR AUCKLAND GEDDES;:   Yes.THE PRILCE MINISTER:   To support any colliery which has a dispute. MR. BRACE:    Certainly.THE PRIME MINISTER:    So that you have practically the whole of their capital behind them, in any dispute between labour-and themsolves.     They   have it now, and why it should be strengthened merely by having an organlsa-tion in districts, with minors on the Board of Directors, I do net know.MR. SMILLIE said, and said quite rightly, that ho attachedvery groat importance to aecose to the books and accounts, so that the minors should know exactly what has been dona.     If they are on the district Board they will get exactly the same access and will have a statutory right to the same access as any other Directory on the Board. So far from strengthening, capital for a conflict, where capital is wrong it will weaken them, and where capital is right it will strengthen them, because it will reveal the facts, and therefore remove the suspicion, and that is all you want.     Therefore, I deeply regret the andwer given by Mr, Smillie that if the Government decide, as we have decided, that we cannot undertake -- and we have definitely decided so far as we are concerned   the. State management of the mines,
he would prefer fleet you should have the old ramshackle condition of competitive pats with harriers, because barriers are net merely a question cf the State ownership of mines;   they are a question, very often, of the fact that you have two collieries working on the same seJ.m -- and that that system should continue with all it a uneconomic and extravagant methods of working.     As* I say, I deeply deplore the conclusion to which he has come - to which he, as the spokesman of the Miners&apos; Federation, has come.I think labour is throwing away a great opportunity of having an effective voice      I am using the words &quot;Effective voice&quot; advisedly      in the control of its own industry, and I do not see how it would stand ultimately in the way of national!nation.   If every nationalisation should become a question which the nation as a whole was disposed to undertake, how could it stand in the way?     tyuite the reverse, in my judgment.     If the nation decided upon it.there is only one reason why it should stand in the way of nationalisation, and that is that it would be such a success from the point cf view of .the worker that the worker would not want, nationalisa-tion.     I cannot think of any other reason why it should be resisted when it in accompanied by a statutory right on the part of the body which is actually managing the mines.
O 0Hewever, if that is the *ylew and the definite and final view of the miners1 Federation, of course it will carry very-great weight with the Government and we shall take it into account, and I shall certainly refer the matter to my col-leagues for their further consideration, in view of the fact that the miners1 Federation objeci to unification, even when it is accompanied by representation on the Board of Directors,The,Only pther point 1 should like to.refer to is Housing. The Housing.Bill was only carried through the Hoose of Commons on the 31st July and, therefore, there .has not been very/much time--MR. SMlLLXEs That is nothing to do with the miners1 housing tha^ we were promised In the Report.   The Housing till had nothing to do with the Sankey Report --with Sankey&apos;s Housing scheme. ..THE PRIME&apos; MINISTER: That is the levy of a Id per&apos;.ton?MR. SMILLIEt No* a immediate housing scheme that was to be startedJ we were praotieally told that everything, was ready for it.MR. BONAR LA&quot;: I never understood why an interim report did not come from the Commission on that.-MR. SMILLIEr  It is&apos;In the ReportsMR. BONAR LAW: But I think the details were promised.   Am I not right?. MR. SMILLIE *   HC. &quot;&apos;W&apos;* OTAR  Mi I think so. &apos;   THE, PRIME MINISTERj   That is what I understood, at any rate. I understood that the Commission were to consider that and to make a further recommendation.   As far as the Government are concerned, we propose that there should be a deduction from the amount /$hich Is payable to the mining royalty owners for their rights, and that that sum of money should be expended upon Improving the conditions In, the mining villages and the amenities of the&apos; mining villages.   Y;e propose to introduce a Bill in respect.to that in the Autumn session.
Since ..,r. SnilJJLo. 3poktJ I have sent to the Local -G^veraamient- Beardr and 1 understand &quot;there are several,jxChemes-which have been prepared by the mining&apos;villages&apos;     a*fter all these schemes have to be prepared by the district and submitted to the Local Government Board, and there are several schemes of that hind rhich have ben drafted   and not only that., but they have bought land for the purpose, and I believe they are proceeding forthwith.   After all, the building of a house is a matter which ta&apos; es some time,, especially having regard to the fact that we come to it after a very great war which has upset the whole industrial conditions of the country    But I have no doubt at all that in the course of the next few months verygreat progress rill be made --ith the building of these houses.I. am afraid I have tried your patience, but I think I have dealt with most of the questions which have been referred to mey, and I do not think you willecomplain that I have l^ojted in giving you a clear and definite view of the position of the Government. . ee had to consider very carefully these great problems, and after hearing the arguments advanced this after-noon., we felt bound to confer and to examine what has been said with a view to determining whether there were any fresh arguments which you had advanced rhich would in the least justify.us In recommending our colleagues-to alter their minds, but although the statement of the case by the three spokesmen of tho hiners1 Federation and. by kr. Stuart Burning has been very powerful as *ell as very lucid, re have come definitely to the conclusion that 1 e cannot see. our ray to advise Parliament to pass a measure for taking over as a business of the State the. management of tho mines of this country.   ,;&quot;e therefore abide by cur other proposals, the first being that re propose to buy out all the mining royalty owners of the Kingdom, to nationalise the coal deposits, ta make a deduction out of the compensation v\hich is paid in order to raise a fund for improving the conditions of life, of the miner in the
villages In which ho dwells, and from which he --corrics-^oiOria .. perilous trade a   \!q also propose to take powers to r^ive tho minor a - effecoive voice by moans of pit committees; and, if&apos; the unification scheme is adopted, by means of representation on the District hoards0   On tho pit Committees.he will have the effective voice in all eonditiona affecting his health, and the safety of the mines,   On the District Board he would have a voice and. an effective voice in the management of the whole of the business.   These are the vi&apos; ws which I am authorised to express on behalf of the Government, and I do not think I can add any-thing now 0MR. SMILLIE:   There are several points which, you have raised, but I think in view of your final remarks we need hardly go into them now,   One   was makinm a mental note as youv.-93.1t alone;, but they are matters of detail and rues of principle, and I w 11 not trouble about them now.   I noticed, however, that you never mentioned the safety of the mines from the beginning to the end of your reply.TK1&quot; PiIla ilRIKTER:   I cannot have that,   I repeatedly said to you that we proposed that the Pit Committees should have a voice with rerarO both to health and safety, I repeated it at the end, and I cannot have it said, and I-will not have it said   it is said for the purpose of prejudice, and I cannot allow it   that I never said anything about the safety of the miners. 0n the c &quot;traxy , it is part of t&quot; e Government1s scheme that the miner himself shall have an effect, ve voice in control Una the conditions that affect his safety and his health.,   &quot;hat more can the Government do than that?hi:. h&quot;&apos;ILLIL:   Uhy should you say that I made that statement for the purpose of prejudice?Thh PR I.

of safety. I said that so long as the mines are worked for private profit, they never will be safe.

THE PRIME MINISTER: That is a matter of argument.

MR. SMILLIE: That is our view.

THE PRIME MINISTER: But I cannot have it said that I did not deal with the question of safety; that is unfair, and I know you do not want to be unfair, and I am sure you would not be.

MR. SMILLIE: My plea from beginning to end, and our plea has been that the mines are largely unsafe because they are worked for private profit. You propose to continue their working for private profit rather than for the State. That is what I meant when I said that you had not referred to that particularly.

THE PRIME MINISTER: I see. But they are only going to be worked for private profit under conditions that enable the miner to have for the first time an effective voice in the pit in which he is working, in the conditions in regard to health and safety under which he works. I want that to be made quite clear.

MR. SMILLIE: As a matter of fact, under the law at the present time we have the right to appoint two men to examine the mine, to go round it, and to look after that part of it. We have that under the law now.

THE PRIME MINISTER: This will give you more than than. As you know, there are certain mines on the Continent where Pit Committees have been appointed, I believe, and they have been found to be extraordinarily useful from the miners&apos; point of view.

MR SMILLIE: We are very much obliged to you for having met us.

MR. STUART BUNNING: I am afraid that we have taken up a very long time, but like yourself, I feel strongly the importance of the questions.

THE PRIME MINISTER: They are very very important, and I have taken some little time myself.

MR. STUART BUNNING: I have only to thank you on the part of the Deputation, for receiving us.



                                            (The Deputation then withdrew).
