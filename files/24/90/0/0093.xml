WJWIIHis Britannic Mai8sty&apos;s Government.* __.___        i i i ii     -   1  ii&apos;111&apos;  mm---&quot;- &apos; &quot;&quot;t&apos;im&apos;,**m -^Military Secret./I112433/fyom Secretary of Slate for India to Viceroy, Army Department,20th October 1919.8.   Your telegrams of 28th August, 11762, of I Oth September, 12358, and of September, 12055.   Role of Malleson&apos;s force is correctly described by you in third paragraph of your telegram.Although touch with events in Central Asia could possibly be adequately kept by small intelligence organisation, it is certain that new Persian force cannot be ready for several months to perform duties of protecting Persia against Pan-Islamic and Bolshevik influence and affording support to Transcaspians. Withdrawal of Malleson&apos;s force from Meshed would leave North-East Persia at mercy of Bolsheviks next spring and might render pressure on Afghanistan more feasible. The difficulty and expense of expelling Bolsheviks from these regions would be infinitely greater than of preventing their ingress.I consider measures should now be taken by you to enable Malleson&apos;s force to be increased &quot;to one regiment cavalry, one battery artillery, and two battalions infantry. Above striking force to be mobile and irrespective of lines of communication formations.Arrangements for winter for accommodation, clothing supplies, should be made accordingly.In addition aeroplanes will be necessary. The Duzdap-Meshed road would have to be kept fit for continuous light motor traffic.i agree that there is no necessity for Malleson to visit Teheran.
