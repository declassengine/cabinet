\(ATER POwER BILL. Llemorandum for the Uar Cabinet by the Lliniater of Transport.1. .   I have considered the draft of the VJater Power Bill whiclT the President of the Board of Trade is seeking sanction to introduce into Parliament at an early date (G*T* 8330)..2.. .   The development of VJater Power will be utilised mainly, if not entirely, in connection with the generation of electricity, and inasmuch as it is .the. intention of the Government that the powers and duties of the Board of Trade under the Electricity Supply Bill should, when that Bill becomes law, be transferred to the Minister of Transport, I suggest that the powers of the Board of Trade under the Uater Power Bill should be similarly transferred, to him,.   To carry this into effect, a clause on tho lines of Clause 44 of the&apos;Electricity Supply Bill should, I suggest, be inserted in the draft water Power Bill.&apos;.&apos; (Sgd)   ERIC CrEDDES*17th October, 1919.
