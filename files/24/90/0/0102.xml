Conversion of Houses into Flats.   Approximately 5,500 houses have been inspected by the London Housing Board with a view to their conversion into flats.     Of this member 1,150 have,so far been found to be suitable and are expected to be readily available for conversion, while it is hoped that a further 950 may be found obtainable for this purpose.3. Conversion of Huts and Hostels.    A Manual on the con-version,of huts and hostels has been prepared and will shortly beissued/
issued.    Already 26 local authorities have applied for over 900 huts for conversion into houses, and 774 huts have been placed at the disposal of 16 of these local authorities.     10 local authorities have actually acquired 258 huts and the work of conversion has been started by 5 local authorities on the provision of 231 houses, 140 of which are already in occupation.With regard to hostels, 1 local authority has already taken over 25 and another has taken over 1 hostel which will provide 44 dwellings which will provide about 125 dwellings, and negotiations in respect of the acquisition of 4 large hostels are in progress with three other local authorities.4.

Under Section 25 of the Housing Town Planning &amp;c., Act, 1919, local authorities are authorised, notwithstanding&apos; the provisions of any building byelaws to consent to the erection for human habitation of buildings which are constructed in accordance with regulations made by the Ministry of Health.    Regulations prescribing the conditions to be complied with in the case of such buildings have been prepared and issued to local authorities.5* Financial Regulations.   Regulations v/ith regard to the calculation and conditions of the financial assistance obtainable by local authorities, public utility societies and housing trusts have been issued.6* Housing,Schemes.   During tho four weeks ended 27th Sept-ember, 502 sites were submitted by Local Authorities and Public Utility Societies for the Ministry&apos;.s approval, making a total of 5,105 (exclusive of a number of sites which had been withdrawn or had been rejected as unsuitable or for other reasons).    The total areas comprised in these sites was about 46,000 acres whicr would provide approximately for some 460,000 houses.    The number of sites approved was 1,723 covering almost 20,300 acres.The total number of applications up to 27th September for approval of lay-outs was 987, of which the Ministry had approved 519.Up/
Up to the same date, house plans for 56,464 houses in all had been submitted, and of these the Ministry had given approval for 22,6*49 houses;   tenders had been submitted for 7,754 houses, and of this number the Ministry had approved of 6,598.7* Public Utility Societies Schemes.

n.....HEALTH,1.   Smallpox.     During the month of September, 11 cases of smallpox ln**BngTand and Wales came to the notice of the Chief Medical Officer.     Of these, 3 occurred In Manchester, 2 in Bolton, 2 in Cardiff, 3 in Abertillery Urban District and 1 in Loddon and Clavering Rural District.     One ship-borne case was landed at Liverpool Port.     The Government Lymph Establishment had a stock of 1,316,000 tubes of lymph in hand at the end of the month.     68,786 tubes of vaccine lymph have been issued during the 5 weeks ended 1st October.2*   Dysentery.     Two small outbreaks of bacillary dysentary have occurred.     In Hayes Urban District there have been 47 cases with 13 deaths.     The circumstances associated with the outbreak are being investigated, and Shiga&apos;s bacillus has been isolated in the Ministry&apos;s laboratory from specimens taken from certain of the patients.     In the Rural District of Peterborough there have been 22 cases with 3 deaths.     It is believed that the disease was introduced into the Rural District by a man who had been travelling on the continent and developed dysentery on the day after he returned home.     In the adjoining Urban District of Peterborough there have been 20 cases with 6 deaths. Shiga&apos;s bacillus has been isolated, from several of the   Peter-borough cases and the outbreak is being investigated.3*   Malaria.   Reports and papers on malaria contracted in England in 1918, have been issued.4. , Infectious Diseases.     The Annual Statement of Notifiable&quot;&apos;Infectious Diseases for the year 1918 has been issued.The Ministry have undertaken to forward weekly or fortnightly to the High Commissioners of the British Dominions an abstract of information respecting infectious diseases at home and abroad for telegraphic communication to their Governments.5.   Veneral Diseases.   Further evidence has been received during the month &quot;that the existing facilities for the treatment of venereal diseases are being used to an extent largely:-in excess of the use made a year ago.An appeal was made to the Court of Criminal Appeal by the chemist and his manager, whose convictions for offences against the Venereal Diseases Act, 1917, were mentioned In the report for the month of August.     The Lord Chief Justice stated that the Court had come to the conclusion that the convictions must stand, but as the prisoners had already been in custody for three weeks, the sentence would be reduced to a period which would mean their immediate discharge.    The chemist, however, would have to pay a fine of  100.     It is feared that the reduction of the sentence, which would seem to imply that the case would have been adequately met by fines, may encourage other delinquents to pursue their illegal practice.6.   Tuberculosis.    A Circular dated the 15th September, 1919, has been issued by the Ministry to the Councils of Counties, County Boroughs, and Metropolitan Boroughs, advising them as to the functions and duties which should be performed by Tuberculosis Officers in relation to the work of Local&quot;War Pensions Committees and Ministry of Pensions Medical Boards.The number of beds for the treatment of tuberculosis in institutions approved by the Ministry has increased duringthe/
t) i bthe month by 326 to a total of 14,821.     During the four weeks ended 26th September, 1919, 740 cases of discharged service men suffering from tuberculosis have been notified to the Ministry as having been sent by English Insurance Cornmittees to sanatoria and other residential institutions under the special arrangements for the preferential treatment of these men,7.

An Order in Council was made on 22nd Septemberfixing the 1st October as the date for the transfer to the Minister-of (1) the powors of the Board of Education with respect to attending to the health of expectant mothers and nursing mothers, and of children who have not attained the age of five years and are not in attendance at schools recognised by the Board of Education,&apos; and (2) the supervision of the administration of Part 1 of the Children Act, 1908.    Circulars were accordingly issued;-(1) On the 24th September to Schools for Mothers and Day Nurseries which had previously been aided by the Board of Education, informing them of the transfer of the Maternity and Child Welfare work and advising them that all conmiunications and applications for grants should be made to the Ministry;   and(2)   On the 30th September to,all Boards of Guardians outside London, informing them of the transfer of the administration of Part 1 of the Children Act, 1908, and asking for a brief statement as to the administration of the Act in the Union, including a statement of the Infant Protection Visitors appointed, the approximate number of children in the Union as to whom notices have been received under the Section 1 of the Act and who are still under supervision, and an indication ox the extent of the supervision exercised by the Visitors.    The appointment of the same officers as Health Visitors and Infant Protection Visitors was also urged.     Similar letters were addressed to the London County Council and the Common Council of the City of London.During the past month approval has been given to proposals by 29 Locai Authorities and 1 Voluntary Agency for extending their schemes of Maternity and Child Welfare.   In 5 of these cases the extensions include the acquisition of premises for Maternity and Child Welfare Centresm Day Nurseries, Maternity and Children&apos;s Hospitals, convalescent homes and homes for unmarried mothers and their children, and in one case a loan amounting to  1,800 was sanctioned.During the month the number of Municipal health Visitors has been increased by 5, and the number of Health-Vis it or s employed by Voluntary Agencies by 2;   tho number of municipal centres by 11 and the number of Voluntary centres by 8.8*   National Health Insurance.   The Minister has decided, after consultation with the &apos;Treasury j. to make a grant of the following war bonus for the year 1919 to insurance practitioners, the amounts having been calculated so as to secure in the aggregate the equivalent as nearly as possible of the corres-ponding bonus paid to Civil Servants:-(A) A payment of z0% of the practitioner&apos;s insurance capitation fees for treatment (up to a maximum of  150) in the case of every practitioner who shews that his total net professional income from all sources does not exceed  5D0a year.(B) A payment of 20p of the insurance capitation fees for treatment (up to a maximum of  300) in the case of every practitioner who shews that his total net profession-al income exceeds  500 but does not exceed  1,200 a year.(C) A payment of 15% of the capitation fees for treat-ment (up to a maximum of  300) in all other cases.it/
It is estimated that for a full year the cost of this bonus will be  900,000, but the amount falling; upon this year&apos;s Vote will be approximately  750,000, of which  250,000 has been provided in the first Estimate, so that a Supplementary Estimate of  500,000 will bo necessary.A memorandum concerning Health and Unemployment Insurance was addressed to the War Cabinet by the Minister on the 29th September.9*   Red Cross Societies.
