M 12SUMMARY3peoial attention is called in this repor-t to the movement for joint action between the strikers in any future national &quot;: stoppage and the Co-operators.   She soheme is, shortly, that the Co-operative Societies shall feed the strikers who, in their turn, shall carry goods for the Societies and no one else.   In other words, the strikers shall be assured of food while the rest of the oommunity is being starved.   There is also a movement for withdrawing the Trades Union funds from gilt-edged securities and depositing them in the Co-operative Bank, where they can be more quickly realised.   It is interesting to note that the Co-operative Sooietiea are now issuing food to the Iron Moulders on strike on the security of the Union&apos;s invested funds, and it is this that is prolonging the strike.Among the rank and file of Labour there is a widespread belief that the next strike will take plaoe among the Transport Workers.   It seems likely, however, that the Coal Miners will run them hard.It is stated among the Railway men that the Looomotive Drivers intend to demand  1 a day about Christmas time, and to oall upon the other grades of liallwaymen to support them by a strike if necessary.!flie oampaign in favour of Nationalisation of the Coal Mines is beginning.   !Ihe rank and file are by no means unanimous, and in Lancashire, where they are unanimous , thepublio/
: 0 public is reported to be against them.Particulars are given about Mr. Qoode. oorresponden the &quot;Manchester Guardian.* * .Mr. George Lanebuiy is trying to raise  300,000 to j the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; on a sure financial basis. Mi-. Foot,! the National Union of Hailwymen, is oonduotlng a series of meetings all over the oountry to &amp;ush the sale.
The defeoto in the organisation of the Hallway ... Strikers are bearing, fruit, and steps have been taken already to make use of the Co-operative Sooieties during the next big national stoppage.    ins movement demands serious attention on aocount of its programme, which is ^ that thev strikers shall be able to draw from their Co-operative Store food for themselves and their families against coupons to be afterwards liquidated out of Union : lv&apos;   funds j and that the toilwaymen and Transport Workers shall continue to carry supplies to the Co-operative Sooieties, while refusing all other goods.    The idea is, of course, to keep the strikers fed while the rest of the oommunity is being starved.      The membership of Co-operative Sooieties &quot;   amounts now to nearly four millions, and their net profits in 1916, before deducting share interest, were  16,335.079. Mr. Fred&quot; Bramley, the Assistant Seoretary of the Trades Union Congress (Parliamentary Committee) has declared that Trade Union funds are to be used for oo-operative development and,oo-operative development to be used for : securing employment under Trade Union conditions.It is now proposed to set up Joint Advisory Counoils all over the country.    lhe names of the members of the London counoil are instructive, for they inolude Mr. Bramley, Mr\ Carolohael, and Mr, Foot, of the National Union of iteilweymen, who are all inolined to be extremists. The Co-operatora on the Counoil are not yet known as Revolutionaries, but their deolared programme is to organise the oombined foroes of Labour and Co-operators in London to abolish capitalism.    It appears to have been forgotten that the Co-operators are themselvescapitalists,/
capitalists, and that during the recent strike in the      ^ Yorkshire coalfields their own employees struck for higher wages.    One plan of the Joint Counoil ia to enquire into the distribution of food and necessaries during strikes, to keep up reserve stocks, to take warehouse aooommodation, and to ensure that sufficientIlabour is available for distributing provisions; and to    I oonsider what shall be done in the way of further strikes [ if there is any attempt made to boycott the Societies or their officials,,    They are good enough to say that they will adhere to the rationing Bystem, tout they will take action to secure that the Co-operative Societies,- being non-profit-making, shall be given preoedenoe in obtaining supplies of rationed goods.    For this purpose, an enquiry is proceeding into the methods of the LondonCombines in milk, traffic, restaurants, etc, and to bring pressure upon public bodies and institutions to discontinue dealing with profit-making firms.It is a very pretty programme, and it is not to be forgotten that the Co-operators have shown themselves to be very good business men and organisers of exceptional ability.    Aooording to Mr. Harry Gosling.,, during the Hallway Strike no less than  600,000 was set free through the medium of the Co-operative Bank, and this is not all; the funds of the Ironfounders Society and other unions are tied up in War Stock and Corporation Loans, and it was the Co-operative Bank vftiioh arranged for bui overdraft to the amount invested in these Stocks.    There is a widespread movement at present to sell out union Funds that are now tied up and to put them all either into the Co-operative Bank or into investments that  oan be realised immediately.NATIONALISATION/
NATIONALISATION OF THE COAL MINES.It is almost oertain that extremists will take advantage of the orusade in favour of nationalisation to put forward revolutionary propaganda.    At a meeting of the Dock Labourers on October 20th, Mr. Smillie announoed the propaganda campaign, and made it clear that if the Government refused nationalisation there would be a oall upon the working class to take direct aotion,    Mr. Braoe addressed a meeting of the Cardiff Business Club on Ootober 16th, in favour of nationalisation,    Mr. Seddon, who reoently addressed a meeting at Hanley , is taking the other side, and says that the miners&apos; leaders are doing great disservioe to the miners and the oountry at large in taking up the question now.    He has a large following in that distriot and hia speeches will probably have a steadying effeot.    It ia, however, oertain that the rank and file are by no means united.    A member of the Exeoutive of the Miners&apos; Federation said that Mr. Hodges would start on a tour round England and Wales next week; that the miners were very backward and would require a great deal of urging;   it was hard work to raise enthusiasm anywhere.The lancashire Miners are strongly in favour of nationalisation and are eagerly awaiting Mr. Smillie&apos;s visit to Liverpool on the 27th Ootober, but publie feeling in Lancashire is said to be opposed to the soheme.    In Northumberland there are to be demonstrations throughout the County, and the leading officials of thelooal Association are to hold fifteen meetings in favour of the soheme on Ootober 25th.Speaking/
Speaking generally, it is probable that the men, wh regard Mr. Smillie as the champion of their oause, would all come out at a word from him.after-MMH OF TO&apos; R&amp;jfcWAY STKJKELMild recriminations among responsible labour leader were to be expected.    Speaking at a Transport Workers&apos; demonstration held at Newport on Ootober 19th, Mr. ftober Williams blamed the Railwrymen^ leaders for an error in tactics,    &quot;They ought&quot;, he said, &quot;to have used themaohineiy of the Triple Allienoe&quot;,    His policy remained!&apos; - ....as it had always been    to recognise that en injury toone Union was an injury to all.    During the railway strike, he said, the negotiators, of whom he was one,were neither neutral nor impartial;   they were out tostandardise War wages.&apos;    In extremist oiroles it isthought that the amalgamation of the National Union ofIteilwaymen and the Lodomotive Drivers has received a stimulus from the strike.    In the event of  fusion, theLooomotive men would demand separate representation onthe Exeoutive Counoil.    Too much importanoe should notat present be attaohed to the rumour that the looomotivedrivers intend to oome out about Christmas in support oftheir demand for  1 per day, and that the National Union&quot;of Bailwavnen would stand by th em,, bo oause the financialcost of the last, strike is almost oertain to aot as a deterrent.. .There appears to be an inoreasing demand that all war Bonuses and percentages should be merged in thegeneral *;;age.     In Coventry and itagby unrest is reported on this -question, and Mr,.. Robert Williams, in a reoentspeech in Wales, was quite explioit.    He said that theworking/
working olasses are determined to seoure a constantly increasing share of the wealth they were producing, and if they were united he did not see why they should not get it.The Transport Workers realise that besides the divisions in their own ranks, it was their financial position which prevented them from coming out.    They are saying that the Government knew this beforehand, and in faot knew everything that was going on and took advantage of its knowledge.    On this point they are very sore.THE POLICE UNION.The Polioe strikers are now becoming depressed.Many of the men are working at the dooks and do not likethe work.    Shey are looking forward to benefiting bythe appeal issued on their behalf by the parliamentary committee of the Trades Union Congress.    As a result of the levy made by the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, the Polioe Union has reoeived a cheque  ibr  1,914,    The men still hope for reinstatement, but they are bitterly disappointed with the lack of support that has come from responsible Labour. -Curiously enough, the-high wages paid to Policemen in country distriots is causing unrest among other bodies of labour.    This is reported from Scotland and the Western and Eastern Counties, where the country polloeman is seen to enjoy a xather easy life and yet to be the best paid man in the village.    The oomplaint is that the work is not skilled, and that the men entered the Polioe Force because they were faot intelligent enough to obtain any other work.    There is,of odurse, a very great difference between the demands made/
(English) , - 6 -made upon the time and intelligence of polioemen in oountry districts and large towns.PBOHTEElilNQ *J*Ifor Manchester qorrespondent reports that there is publio ^iseatiefaotiou&apos; with the way in which the Profiteering Act is being administered..   People do not like to appear in person before thV tribunals and they suggest that Inspectors should be appointed with whom they oould lodge complaints, and that it should be their duty to investigate them in person,*FEELING MQHG: DISaiAiiflSl) iS6WJMM:From various parts of the country I have reoeivedreports that there is disoontent among the dischargedmen, ohiefly upon the&quot;ground of unemployment.   InNottingham 3,000 are said to be still out of work,and in Lancashire a far larger number.    IXiring thePrime Minister&apos;8 visit to Sheffield, the AtteroliffeBranoh of the National federation displayed bannerswith .the following device:-*Ivten are: being paid  50. for, four hours of &quot;heaven on the Khlne,, while those who had &quot;four years of hell got  28&quot;.Other devices pomplained of poverty and of variousgrievances.The movement to affiliate&quot; various ex-Servioe men&apos;s organisations is growing.   Iheir leaders feel that it is only through&apos; common! action that they will* get redress.   Ihe Sailors&apos;, Soldiers&apos; and AUrmen&apos;8 Union is now: praotically defuhot.   Its balanoe sheet shows a debt of  77. 6s. Qd. the principal creditor being the Victoria House Publishing Company, which is pressing for settlement.   OJie. Union, now: proposesamalgamation/
amalgamation with the International Union of Ex-Servioe Men, an extremist organisation in Glasgow.THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS  vStrenuous efforts are being made to seoure the eleotion of labour candidates in the municipalities, The cost of food, the shortage of houses, and the excessive rates are ail subjeots which deeply affect the public, and the labour candidates are freely promising relief in all of these.   The extremists in Leeds even go so far as to think that if they are successful they may turn the looal bodies into a sort of Soviet.THE DOCKYARD DISfflifctflESThere is much anxiety in Plymouth, Portsmouth, and Woolwioh about the discharges from the dockyards.   At a mass meeting of Trades Unionists at Plymouth on the 20th Ootober, Mr. Dan Hilman, 3eoretary to the Dockers&apos; Union, said that rather than see thousands of men walking the streets of Plymouth in search of work, he would go through &quot;the throes of a bloody revolution,&quot;TH.S BBITISH SOCIALIST PA&amp;TYThe declaration of this Party in favour of the Third International of Lenin has resulted in the resignation of Mr. Hi Alexander, the Treasurer, and Mr. Pairohild, the Sditor of &quot;The Call&quot;, the Party&apos;s official organ.   In view of Mr, Jairohild&apos;s public utterances in the past, it is rather surprising that,having/*m   7   ...
having swallowed the camel of revolution, he should strain at the gnat of the Mosoow International, hut he has deolared that Socialism can be obtained through Parliamentary aotion, whioh would give control of the toy and Navy, and cannot be won by foroe.   Like other extremists, he has forgotten the existence of the middle classes and the artisans.At a meeting of the Socialist Labour Party at Nottingham on the 19th, a speaker named Stewart was heard urging the workers to take no heed of the appeals for higher production, as it would not bring down the cost of living, but only inorease the profits of the oapitalist. &apos;THE LONDON WOiffCE:^&apos; COMMITTEEDavid Ramsay, who lately underwent imprisonment for a violent speech, has now been elected Secretary of the Joint Committee of the London Workers and Shop Stewards. He is extremely active in enrolling members and addressing meetings.   On Ootober 19th, at a meeting in Poplar, he told his audience that revolution was no longer distant. They were no longer to trust their Unions.   They might continue to subsoribe to them, beoause they would thus excite less suspicion while preparations for the revolution were being made.   They were to keep up a ferment for higher wages, so that the capitalists, who are now hovering on the brink of bankruptcy, will be brought nearer to the preoipioe.&quot;HANDS OFF MJSSIA&quot;The People&apos;s flussian Information Bureau iscirculating/
circulating a wireless message, dated September 29th, from Tohitoherine to the British and Prenoh workers, appealing to them to foroe their Governments to oonolude peaoe.   (The fact is that the British extremists are almost as much oonoemed for the fate of the Communist regime in russia as Trotsky himself.   In Leeds they have raised an outcry against the &quot;apathetic British workers&quot; for not ooming to the aid of the xiusaians by a general strike.   Ihe dockers in Bristol passed a resolution on the 20th against the supply of munitions to the oounter-revolutionaries, and urged working men to refuse to produce or oarry suoh munitions,   A similar resolution was passed by the Northumberland Miners&apos; Association, but in spite of all this sound and fury the rank and file refuse to be interested in anything Russian.Mft. W. T., GCODEMr. Qoode, correspondent of the &quot;Msnohester Guardian&quot;, arrived in this oountry on H.M.S. &quot;Danae&quot; on the 29th September.   His articles in the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; began to appear on the 13th October, and are oontinuing. The &quot;Daily Express&quot; had agreed to publish them simultaneously with the &quot;Manchester Guardianbut ofter three had appeared, the Editor considered them to be Bolshevik propaganda, and refused to publish any more, probably because he received protests from his subscribers.   The articles are partisan in tone, and contain many obvious inaoouraoies, suoh as the.statement that the Bolsheviks axe impartial towards the Church, that Jews ere a minority among the Commissaries; and that prostitution hasdisappeared./
(English)disappeared.   On the whole, they seem to have fallen rather flat.Mr. Goode left a sealed packet containing his papers with the Enthonian Government, who promised to forward it to the Ssthonian Legation in London.   The paoket has not yet arrived, but a3 Mr. scott, Editor of the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;, has given an undertaking that it contains no message of peaoe addressed to the British people, it is not proposed to insist upon an examination of its contents.MB. TOM MftNffMr. Mann has issued a declaration of faith on his eleotion as General Seoretary of the Amalgamated Sooiety of Engineers.   It is headed, &quot;The Six-Hour Day and the Five-Day Week.&quot;   The argument Is that the only way of absorbing the unemployed is to reduce the hours.&quot;Whatever the amount of work to be done may &quot;be, all eligible workers should share In doing &quot;it ....... The thirty hour week is justified&quot;economically and ethioally .......... Two days a&quot;week from toil and the other days to be of six &quot;hours is a praotloal level-headed proposal.&quot;He goes on to urge all the Shop Stewards to spread thegood news throughout the country.M0VBMMT3-0? B.G. TILAKIn a letter to a correspondent, dated 21st &apos; Ootofrer, Tllak announoes his departure, by a steamer leaving London on the 30th Ootober.. &apos;    HUN ON-TEE GHEENOOK FdOVIDENT -BANK - ..On Ootober l6th.,- rumours, were circulated that the - ; Green00k Provident Bank was in difficulties, and &apos; there was a run upon it,;..forty Ar fifty, accountsbeing/
(English)being olosed.   It is now reported that this run*was engineered as an experiment by the Sub-Committee of the Soviet Defenoe Committee at the instanoe of Guy Aldred, well known as an anarchist, atheist and oonsoi en ti cub objeotor.THE &quot;DAIfrY HERALD&quot;If Mr. George Lanabury is not a oonspiouously successful business manager, he la an indefatigable salesman.   I mentioned in a former report that the &quot;Hands Off ftissia&quot; Meeting in the Albert Hall appeared to be more oonoemed with pushing the sale of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; than with itossia.   Mr. W.T. Foot, Secretary of the London Counoil of the National Union of riailwaymen, is now touring the country on behalf of the &quot;Daily Herald.&quot;  He is to hold a meeting every day for five weeks.   The paper devotes much space to its great scheme for increasing the circulation to a million, and displays its announcement, a little unfortunately if prophetically, surrounded by a blaok border.   In the issue of Ootober 18th, Mr.   Lansbury announced that whatever money is subscribed, the proprietors are determined that not a penny of profit, dividend or interest shall oome to the proprietors, and that any profits will be used to build up a oreditable labour Press.   It is a safe offer, beoause the paper is still losing about  750 a week.There is a movement in every Important town in the Midlands to support a weekly Sooialist paper like &quot;The Pioneer&quot;, which is issued in LeioeBter.CONVICTIONOn Ootober l6th a Russian sailor named Ivan Gurieffwas/
(English)was sentenced in Liverpool to six months1 imprisonment and redommended for oeportation, fo having in his possession, for propaganda purpose the leaflet &quot;To Seamen,&quot; whioh has been describe in former reports.THE 3EXi^i3TEMINATIQN LEAGUEUnder the guise of a 3elf-Determination Le for Ireland there is a tendency all over the oa for Irish and Labour Associations to work togethl In Battersea seven Irish candidates,are standing the Counoil Elections, with the full foroe of 1 behind them, and elsewhere English Labour oandt are receiving the support of the Irish.   It was noted that at a Sinn Fein meeting at Glasgow thi most violent speakers were members of the Labou Party, James Maxton, Neil Maclean, Wheatley, Commander Kenworthy and Councillor Shinwell.   It went so far as to say that if the Glasgow Autho: formed a Civio Guard, the working men of GlasgoJl would form a Hed Guard, and that men who oould rivets could &quot;pulp the heads of the middle olas It is right to say, however, that Glasgow has been so quiet at any time during the last ten j as it is now.The &quot;Watohword of Labour,&quot; whioh was supp. in Ireland, is now published in Manchester.Nothing of importance ooourred in-the Proi &apos; during the past week. ; Sinn Fein is believed in several counties to be still losing ground, the the undercurrent of disloyalty and opposition
(English)law continues, notably in Monster, and the republicans confidently assert that they will increase the 73 seats now held by them to 80 at the next General Eleotion.The country is full of literature advooating the Irish xtepublioan Loan, and during the past 10 days the polioe have been kept busy seizing this and removing the numerous small posters whioh have been displayed in nearly every County.   On 17th, Alexander McCabe, Sinn Fein M.P. for South Sligo, was sentenced to three months1 imprisonment with hard labour for having delivered an address urging support of the loan.   The proceedings evoked little interest and a few sympathisers attended the trial.The principal event of the week was His Excellenoy&apos;8 Proclamation of 15th instant, direoting the suppression of Sinn Fein and its kindred associations in the City and County of Dublin.   This necessitated the suppression of the annual Ard Feis of Sinn Fein, which was fixed to be held in the Mansion House, Dublin, on l6th and 17th instant. A very large number of delegates were to attend from the Frovinoes, but it is curious to note that although County i-iosoommon was entitled to send nearly 100 delegates, only about a dozen left for Dublin on 15th, in spite of the faot that the news of the suppression oould not them have reaohed that County.The Countess Markievieoz was released from Cork Gaol on 15th instant.The/
- 14 -(English) 4Ifre third issue of &quot;The Watchword of Labour&quot; is nc in circulation and, though by no means as pbjectionabli as the preoeriing issue, is deoidedly Bolshevist in toneIt announoes that the executive of the Trades Counoil hi resolved to summon a Conferenoe to demand the free return of James Larkin to this oountry, and, if agreed upon, to call a 24 hour protest strike of all Unions.This paper also refers to &quot;Qovemmenfs ignominioui surrender&quot; to the English railway strike, but olaims that Ireland has been&apos;unfairly treated by the National Union of railwaymen and abuses Messrs. Cramp and ThomasAnew weekly, &quot;Old Ireland,&quot; with a Sinn Fein polioy, has just appeared.   No. 1 is dated Saturday, Ootober 18th, and is being printed by the Sooialist Labour Press, 50, Renfrew Street. Glasgow.   Captain J.3, White end Mrs., Sheehy Skeffington are two of its contributors.It is understood that the Scottish Sinn Fein Exeoutive are preparing to publish ether periodicals advocating Sinn Fein, to replace the Irish papers whioh have been suppressed. .The Sooiaiist Party of Ireland, whioh has been re-organised since Easter 1916, have affiliated themselves to the Moscow International.B&quot;.
