WAR CABINET. r.^8391^   I ^ ......Hote by the J3hjancSit L.0JL Jh  exchequer.In the memorandum circulated by the l^od Controller, G.T.8382, paragraph 6, Mr, Roberts say.s that he wag left with the impression that it was my desire &quot;to maintain the retail price of sugar at 7d. until the next Budget, even at the cost of depleting the reserves of the Sugar Commission, with the intention that an increase in the retail price should&apos;coincide with the reduction of the Sugar Duty&quot;.   This is a misapprehension j     which I am anxious to correct at onceiWhen the cabinet decided to remove the restrictions on the I     barrelage of beer,, and when, as at first, it was contemplated I     that an increased duty should be charged in respect of theadditional profits derivable from the increased output, I con-Isidered as one possibility the application of a part of this money to the reduction of the sugar duty.   The Cabinet decided, however, to waive the extra taxation in favour of an improve-ment in the quality of the beer brewed-   I do not, therefore, I     receive the extra beer revenue out of which the reduction in the sugar duty might have been made, and I certainly cannot cent em-plate as a probability any reduction in the sugar duty next1Spring.On the broad question raised by Mr. Roberts I am strongly in favour of an immediate increase in price.   As long as the Commission&apos;s selling price i3 less than the market price abolition of control and the resumption of the free market are impossible,   control tends to perpetuate itself, and in my opinion the time has come when we should at least approximate I     more nearly to natural conditions.(initialled)   A.O.I treasury, S.W,j   g5rd October, 1919,
