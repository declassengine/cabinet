NATIONALISATION OF INDUSTRIES.

An alternative suggested by Mr. W.S. Abell, Chief Ship Surveyor, Lloyd&apos;s Register of Shipping.

Dear Mr. Lloyd George,



               We have all of us, who desire to promote the welfare of our country, being desirous of finding some alternative scheme of government to the nationalisation idea which is obsessing the minds of certain sections of the community, realising that nationalisation in the sense of present day interpretation means the doom of individuality.

 I think it is ? also that the producing portion of the community, usually ? labour, was treated formerly in a manner which might fairly be termed a blot on the civilisation of this country, and that any scheme of re-adjustment must be necessity give fairer representation to the "labour" section of the country then formerly.



                                                                                     I/



                                              
I believe, without prejudice, that I have formed an approximate idea of the proper solution of this difficulty, and it is with the hope of helping that I should like to put it forward for your consideration.

It has been any good fortune in a short life and from an early age to have been intimately connected with three distinct types of large organisation, and it is from these studies that I am induced to feel that there is some hope in the point of view which I wish to Suggest. 

The necessary hypothesis are as follows:-

(1) It is the duty of the Government to direct the development of industry for the benefit of the whole community.

(2) This directions is obtained in the simplest and least irksome manner, when each industry has been so organised as to regulate itself, the Government control only being necessary when the industrial organisation failes in its national duty.

(If this hypothesis be accepted it at once follows that the most successful form of Government is that in which the greatest amount of national responsibility is borne by the regulating industrial organisation)

(3) In order that the industrial organisation may successfully perform its duties, it is essential that -

(a) each section of the community concerned in the industry shall have reasonable and proper representation,

(b) no one section shall be in  a position to dominate the decisions of the organisation, and from this it follows that -

(c) the representatives of the various sections shall be comprised in more than two, i.e. at least three distinct groups, embracing equal numbers of votes
votes. In this manner, agreement between any two groups of sections is essential for a decision, and no one group can obtain undue influence on the industry as a whole except by agreement with another group.

This general statement may perhaps seem rather complex, although in actual working the solution is simple when once a proper conception is formed of the relative importance of the various sections of the industry.

In English methods of trading there are always three groups:-

(1) producers,

(2) distributors, and

(3) users,

while there may occur for particular purposes such as the formation of safety regulations -

(4) insurers (which would replace 2 above) leaving still 3 groups only.

In certain other cases where as may happen producers are also distributors, it will be found collaterally that users may be split up into two groups large and small, and hitherto I have not found any great difficulty in devising a regulating organisation with the three distinct groups necessary for safeguarding the rights of a particular section of industry.

I may say that I have just returned from a visit to Norway and Sweden where I have been helping the maritime industries of those countries to set up organisations for the control of safety regulations in the manner I have previously discussed, and in those countries also the Governments have realised the desirability of working on these lines. The movement is now coming rapidly to a successful conclusion, and it appears that both Government and industry are likely to be placed in a better relation than us yet obtains in this country although I am working to the same and here.

I may add that as far as British law is concerned, there
there does not appear to be inherent difficulties, since Dr. Purvas, of Exeter, and myself have been engaged for the 1? eighteen months on the production of a Hydro-Electric scheme for Devonshire obtained from the high rainfall of Dartmoor, the Bill for which was produced last Easter, or but which has been held up by the Government on account of pressure of its own business.

We have succeeded in drafting this Bill in such a manner that approximately equal representation is give to three groups, viz:-

(1) the producers and distributors (who provide the generation and distribution of electric power),

(2) the domestic users (urban and rural areas in the district covered) and

(3) industrial users (who take power in large measure or who jointly in a district take large amount of power).

If such can be done for an ? scheme, I do not ? that the same general lines cannot be followed in the regulation of a colliery, or for that matter of any form of industry.

I do not propose to you any cut and dried remedy for the working of collieries, as I should first wish to study the problem of production in more detail ? I have yet done.  I hope, however, that I have given you such general outlines as may throw some light on your difficulties which, as ever, I will do what I can to further elucidate.

I  am,

Yours faithfully
