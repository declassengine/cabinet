The &quot;Times&quot; Correspondent states, however, that publication will be subject to the agreement of the British Government..In view of the interestHaken in this oountry as well as in France in these &quot;revelations&quot; it is thoeght that members of the Far Cabinet may like to refresh their memory as to what actually transpired.     I accordingly attach herewith copies of the&apos; prooes-verbaux of the several Conferences.Intrinsically there would appear little -oi nothing to object to from the British point of view in the publication of these particular documentsP     A very big question of principle is raised, however,, by the proposal to publish them.     I,f this particular series is published how is the demand to be resisted for the publication of the whole series&quot;of International conferences?

Robertson, G.C.B., K.C.V.O, D.S.O., Chief of the Imperial General Staff.Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, G.C.B., G.O.V.O., K.C.I.E., Commander-in-Chief, British Expeditionary Force.M.

Hankey, K.C.B., Secretary, War Cabinet.Professor Mantoux, Interpreter.The French Railways.General Geddes stated that the British railway requirements amounted to : Tons per week.Imported material        .. .. ..        .. ..      220,000-250,000Local traffic bought in France     .. .. .. ..      100,000Total......      320,000-350,000The present capacity of the French railways was : Tons per week.Imported material        .. .. ..       ... ..        ..      150,000Local traffic    ..        .. .. .. .. .. ..       70,000Total   ........      220,000That, he said, was the position to-day.After the completion of certain works the French hoped to increase their carrying-capacity by rail from the ports to 200,000 tons a week, which, he understood from General Ragueneau, could be done by the 1st April. We required that they should increase it to carry 30,000 tons a week in excess of this. He understood from General Ragueneau that he hoped to be in a position very soon to increase the capacity of the railways serving the ports by 50,000 tons a week above the present total of 150,000[660-17]     &quot; V v
tons per week. General Ragueneau considered, however, that we ought to endeavour to develop the northern ports, owing to the difficulty of obtaining sufficient rolling-stock to serve the southern ports. The northern ports were capable of handling 40,000 tons a week more than at present, so far as dock accommodation was concerned, and as they were not getting waggons to enable them to utilise it, General Geddes was afraid that the suggestion could not be of any immediate help. What he wished to know was how soon General Ragueneau would be able to supply the additional 50,000 tons a week of railway traffic serving the ports, as well as the additional 30,000 tons of local traffic to enable us to reach our requirements.General Ragueneau said that it was difficult to differentiate the 100,000 tons local traffic from the other traffic, but there was no difficulty about&apos; carrying it. He reminded the Conference that the difficulty of supplying coal must not be overlooked. As regards the 200,000 tons of traffic serving the ports which General Geddes required, instead of the 150,000 tons already realised, he hoped to achieve it by the end of March. In the meanwhile, a constant improvement was being effected. The actual figure which he hoped to reach was 194,000 tons a week, which was within measurable distance of 200,000 tons.General Geddes said that the local traffic was almost as important, and that the British army needed 30,000 tons a week more. At present he believed that the traffic was one-third British and two-thirds French.General Ragueneau said that out of 17,000 to 18,000 waggons transported on the Nord Railway daily, 6,000 were allotted to commercial traffic. Recently, however, owing to restrictions imposed on local traffic, the quantity had been reduced to 4,400, hence, even taking 6,000 as the normal, not more than one-third of the waggons in movement were allotted to commercial traffic. Of the 6,000 allotted to commercial traffic, 3,000 was the average regularly allotted for coal, 1,400 were allotted largely for war factories, 1,000 for the supply of the population, and of these latter, 500 were for local transport and 500 loaded for the interior of the country.Mr. Lloyd George said that the Conference was ill-adapted to consider such minute matters. It was impossible for the Ministers to check these technical details. What really mattered was that General JSTivelle and Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig had arranged certain operations in concert, and that General Niveile and the French Government had been pressing the British Government to he ready by a certain date. He wanted to know, therefore, when the French railways would be in a position to carry a total of 300,000 tons a week ? The sooner this could be done the more effective would our offensive be. If it could not be done, either Sir Douglas Haig must make his attack insufficiently provided, or else he must postpone it. We only wished to know when the French railways could meet our requirements, and the sooner they could do it the better.General Ragueneau said that he hoped to be able to meet the requirements of the British Army by the end of March, when his programme was completed.Mr. Lloyd George said that Sir Douglas Haig could not commence his attack until the necessary railway transport was available.M. Claveille enquired how much postponement was involved in the delay in the completion of the railway programme ?M. Briand asked to what extent the date of the commencement of the attack was affected by these delays ? He wished to know the relation between the completion of the transport arrangements and the date of the attack.General Nivelle said he understood from Sir Douglas Haig that three weeks must elapse between the provision of the total amount of transport required and the date of the attack.M. Briand asked how the transport conditions before the commencement of the offensive on the Somme compared with the present conditions : were they sensibly better at that time ?General Nivelle said that they undoubtedly were very inferior.General Ragueneau said that they were far worse, but at that time it was easier to satisfy the demands of the armies.   Probably at that time only 150,000 tons a week
were required, but no exact comparison could be made because at that time the requirements of the armies were not reduced to figures.General Nivelle said he hoped that the proposed delay of three weeks could be reduced for the following reasons : First, because until the end of March we did not expect to have the full supply ; and, second,, because between the present date and the end of March there would be a gradual improvement.Of course he recognised that it was desirable to have the maximum transport before we commenced our offensive, but this did not imply that we could not start without it. There was, indeed, a maximum which we hoped to realise, but there was also a minimum, and when that was realised the offensive could be commenced. In these circumstances, he considered it certain that Sir Douglas Haig and he between them could reduce the period of three weeks.Mr. Lloyd George pointed out that the greater the delay in reaching the maximum the longer would be the postponement of the date of our operations. Unless there was a very great improvement we could not be expected to undertake the offensive by the date arranged. He was very anxious that M. Claveille and General Ragueneau should understand this.M. Claveille said that there was one essential condition, namely, that the amount of locomotive power which the British Government had undertaken to supply should be forthcoming ; at present it was behindhand.Mr. Lloyd George asked General Geddes what reply he had to make to this ?General Geddes stated that he first wished to reach an agreement about the question of tonnage and trains in railheads. He pointed out that the figure of 200,000 tons required in the ports had already been reduced from 250,000 tons by an abatement in Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s demands made in consequence of the shortcomings of the railways. Having obtained the railway facilities required to serve the ports as well as the local traffic, which consisted of such matters as stone for metalling the roads, and timber, which was just as essential to military operations as ammunition, the next step was to get it to the front. He had arranged that 200 trains a day should proceed to railhead. It was absolutely necessary to have these 200 trains. In this connection he reminded the Conference that a good deal of railway traffic was required for the maintenance of stocks, and until you reached your total of 200 trains your forward dumps could not be realised. To-day, however, we were only able to run 80 trains a day to the front. In addition to the trains to the railhead, a number of trains were required to run from ports to depots and from one depot to another. These services accounted for 45 to 50 trains a day, making our total requirements 250 trains a day. He understood from General Ragueneau that he could reach 200 by the 1st April, hut that he could only do this by stopping the supplies for the civil population, and then only for a maximum period of fifteen days.General Ragueneau said that the 75 to 80 trains a day running from bases allowed us to evacuate 150,000 tons. By adding 10 to 15 trains a day, and by obtaining a few extra trucks, he hoped to reach the 200,000 tons. Thus he hoped to solve the whole question of the 200,000 tons. But the 200 trains a day required to go to railhead were another matter. He understood that these were required during the actual military operations, whereas the 200,000 tons were required during the preparatory stage. He had great hopes of an improvement shortly, owing to the breaking of the frost, which freed the canals for navigation. This undoubtedly would ease the situation, but he warned the Conference that the 200 trains required during the operation could only be supplied for a temporary effort. This figure could only be achieved by stopping the coal from the Pas de Calais mines, and by limiting the supplies of the civil population, and this could only he done for a comparatively short period.General Geddes said that the scheme had been drawn up in three phases: 1. Preparatory;2. The actual operations ; and3. The period succeeding the operations, when it was hoped an advance would be practicable.In the first period the railway movements were mainly confined to munitions and stores ; in the second there were added hospital trains. It was a great disappointment to him to learn that the 200 trains a day could only be supplied for a short period.
When the arrangements had been made nothing had been said about limiting this, period to fifteen days. The letter describing the arrangements made was on record, and it contained no time limit.General Ragueneau said that at the Conference with General Freeland it had been explicitly stated that the 200 trains could only be supplied during the period of the operations. He felt some surprise when he learned that 200 trains were required during the period of preparation. The time during which these trains were required had not been definitely stated, but he had always understood that they were required only during the actual operations. The President of the Council would support him that this was clearly understood in regard to coal. He also wished to add that he felt considerable surprise at the size and number of the trains required when compared with the demands of the French armies, which were being prepared for similar operations. The French, whose striking force consisted of 70 divisions, only required 2,800 waggons a day for two groups of armies. But the requirements of the British striking force of little more than half the size was 8,000 waggons a day. He could not understand how it&apos; was that the British army required so many more waggons than the French when the French effectives were so much greater.General Nivelle agreed with General Ragueneau. If all the operations were calculated on the same principles as those adopted by the British no operation, he said, would be possible at all. He could not understand why so many trucks were required during the operation. He could understand that the Red Cross trains were needed, but he could not understand that additional ammunition trains were required, since, presumably, great reserves of ammunition would be accumulated at the front. He did not consider the period of fifteen days as too short. If we did not succeed within fifteen days we should not continue our offensive. If we failed we should stop. On the other hand, if we did succeed we should get into manoeuvre warfare, and the mass of material required for trench warfare would be reduced. As General Officer responsible for the plan he engaged himself that fifteen days should suffice.Mr. Lloyd George said that the discussion might continue for ever on these lines. The experts did not appear to agree upon a single figure. He suggested, therefore, that the experts &quot;should retire and discuss the question among themselves, bringing back to the Conference any points which they wished decided. At present there appeared to be too many points at which they were at variance. If they were unable to agree, the British representatives would have to state what the position of the British Army would be in case of failure of the French railways to accomplish what was asked of them.M. Briand agreed.[The Railway Experts then unthdrew and the Conference adjourned for a short time.]o

September 1918._-___. 1 XSECRET.I.C.-17(a). r 82NOTES OF AN ANGLO-FRENCH CONFERENCE HELD AT THE HOTEL TERMINUS, CALAIS, ON FEBRUARY 26 AND 27, 1917.Second Session.February 26, 1917, 5*30 p.m.Present :The Right Hon. David Lloyd George, M.P., Prime Minister.General Sir W. R. Robertson, G.C.B., K.C.V.O., D.S.O., Chief of the Imperial General Staff.Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, G.C.B., G.C.V.O., K.C.I.E., Oommander-in-Chief, British Expeditionary Force.M. Briand, President of the Council.General Lyautey, Minister of War.General Nivelle, Commander-in-Chief, French Army.Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Maurice P. A. Hankev, K.C.B., Secretary, War Cabinet.Professor Mantoux, Interpreter.M. Briand said that it was not the business of the two Prime Ministers to make plans. It was their business, however, to know and understand the plans and to assent to them. He proposed, therefore, that the Generals should be asked to state their plans and conclusions.Mr. Lloyd George agreed.General Nivelle then explained very fully, with the aid of maps, Marshal Jofrre&apos;s plan, and the reasons which had led him to reject it, and then his own plan of attack, in which Sir Douglas Haig was in general agreement.[It has not been considered desirable to describe the plans, owing to the extreme importance of secrecy.&apos;]Mr. Lloyd George said that so much depended upon the forthcoming operations that there ought to be no misunderstanding at all. He therefore asked that all those present might speak very frankly. He asked General Nivelle to give his opinion as to the preparations along the whole front. He pointed out that the enemy had only one army under a single command. The nearer the Allies could approach to one army the better. He asked what preparations General Nivelle would propose for complete success, and whether he desired any alteration in the present arrangements ? He hoped that he would feel no delicacy or reserve in expressing his full opinion. The situation was far too serious for such reserves. He wanted to know everything that ^ was in General Nivelle&apos;s mind. It was far better that he should say it now than that *H there should be any misunderstanding afterwards.M. Briand said that he fully shared this idea. The present hour was much too grave for any doubts or hesitations to remain unexpressed. The battle we now contemplated might probably have a decisive result. The plan must therefore be executed without hesitation and loss of time endangering its success.   Neither[660-18]
Government must be able to say afterwards that such and such a preparation was forgotten. Consequently, he fully agreed with Mr. Lloyd George in wishing that General Nivelle and Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig should speak their whole minds and state exactly what they considered was required to ensure complete co-operation 1 and the best possible dispositions for our forces. If the two Generals are in agreement, the Governments had no more to do than to express their agreement.General Nivelle said he was much touched by the confidence which had been shown in him, and by the invitation to express his opinion. He had not asked for this meeting, but as it was being held he would express his opinion frankly. He considered that whoever had the responsibility for the plan, whether it was Sir Douglas Haig or himself, must take that responsibility in full possession of all the facts. The future of the two countries might depend on our success. It was therefore his duty to both countries to speak plainly. He said he had always been in perfect agreement with Sir Douglas Haig, and he wished to take this opportunity to thank him for his co-operation. When his present plans were initiated on the 17th December, 1916, Sir Douglas Haig had, after reflection, concurred in them, and done all he could to assist in their development. He reminded the Conference that the general plan was finally settled at the Conferences held in London on the 15th January, 1917, when it had been arranged that the British Army should take over an additional section of the French line. The final relief was actually taking place, he believed, to-day ; that is to say, the programme had been completed a week before the date fixed by the Conference, for which he expressed his gratitude. Considering how difficult it was to arrange complete co-ordination even in the period of preparation, General Nivelle insisted that once the battle was engaged there must be no sort of hesitation, He did not anticipate any difficulties between the Commanders-in-chief, who were veritable brothers in arms. He considered, however, that there must be certain rules which should not only guide the relations of the Generals themselves, but should also be binding on&apos;their successors if either of them disappeared. Eeverting to what he had said about the fate of the two countries being involved, General Nivelle said that he did not wish to imply that failure entailed defeat. What he meant was that the success we looked for would have very important results; if we succeed, these results might be decisive, and it was in this sense that he had spoken.Mr. Lloyd George asked if General Nivelle would now state the rules which should govern the two Generals.General Nivelle suggested, that perhaps Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig would like to say a few words first.Sir Douglas Haig suggested that General Nivelle should first give his ideas on the subject of the rules to govern the relations of the Generals.General/Nivelle: $aid that the limits of the special powers of the man who was responsible should not be restricted either in time or in scope. His first point was that the spirit in which the rules were interpreted must be the same as heretofore. In every emergency the British Commander-in-chief had always acted almost as though his army were part of the French army. His second point was that the whole of the preparations and the execution of the projected operations ought to be in the same hands&apos;without any limits as regards time. In this connection he gave an example of the difficulties involved even in the time of preparation.It is not considered desirable to give General Nivelle&apos;s exact illustration, as this could not be done without stating part of his plan. It is sufficient to state that it referred to an operation in which Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Eaig had felt compelled to allot a considerable proportion of his force to defend a flank which, in General Nivelle&apos;&apos;&apos;s opinion, diverted the main direction of the force from the selected objective.General Nivelle stated that he only gave this illustration, which was now solely of historic interest, as an instance of the difficulties which arise under the present system.Sir Douglas Eaig expressed agreement with General Nivelle that their relations had always been most intimate.   After two and a half years of continuous service in  &quot;) France he thought that the relations between the two armies had never been closer
0than they were now. This was not only the case as regards the headquarters, but also in all branches of the service, among which he instanced the flying services.In regard to previous operations, he had always, after discussion, been able to ll come to a complete agreement with Marshal Joffre as regards strategical plans, but had himself been responsible for the tactical arrangements for attacks made by the British Army to attain the general objects assigned to the British. Again, when Marshal Joffre was succeeded by General Nivelle, and the latter had proposed new plans, he had accepted them in principle, and had done his utmost to dispose his forces to meet the change of objectives. He had agreed to General nivelle&apos;s plan, notwithstanding that it diminished the amount of reserves at his disposal. Moreover, he had told the British Government that he would at once accept the plan if they desired our army to play a less active role. In fact, he had made every effort to &quot; play the game.&quot; Sir Douglas Haig then gave his views on the illustration chosen by General Nivelle, pointing out that his tactical plans had been determined as a result of repeated reconnaissances, that he had himself finally made the decision after consultations with the Army commanders concerned, and that his decision was solely based upon tactical considerations. He added that actual events, i.e., the enemy&apos;s retreat, showed the correctness of the decision to which he had come.General Nivelle gave his opinion that strategical considerations were involved owing to the fact that the attainment of the objective by a striking force was affected.Mr. Lloyd George said that he and M. Briand were at a disadvantage in discussing this question by means of illustrations. As civilians they were not competent to express an opinion. He asked, therefore, that General Nivelle should put down on paper the rules which he considered ought to guide the two Generals in order that they might be considered by himself and his advisers, who would give their views on them in the morning.General Nivelle consented to do this. He said he was quite certain that whatever happened Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig and he would always be able to work in complete agreement.M. Briand agreed with General Nivelle. He wished, however, to pose a question of principle before the Conference broke up for the evening. This principle was that, for the forthcoming operations, it was necessary to have complete agreement and real unity of direction. If this principle was accepted, all that we should require was a formula carrying it out, to which the Conference could agree.Mr. Lloyd George said that we had never ohallenged the principle.M. Briand said that he had confidence in both the Commanders-in-chief, either in one or the other, but that he did not feel confidence in a system of duality.(The Conference then adjourned.)

David Lloyd George, M.P., Prime Minister.General Sir W. R.

Briand, President of the Council.General Lyautey, Minister of War.General  Nivelle,  Commander-in-Chief^ French Army.Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Maurice P. A. Hankey, K.C.B., Secretary, War Cabinet.Professor Mantoux, Interpreter.[By 8 p.m. on the previous evening the French representatives had issued the &quot; Projet oVOrganisation &quot; attached [Appendix I). The &quot; Projet&quot; was considered by the British representatives, who were unable to accept it, but Mr. Lloyd George submitted instead a fresh draft. This latter draft had been, to a large extent, agreed to by personal negotiation before the assembly of the Conference on the 27th February, and forms the basis of the Agreement on page 4 of these Notes.]Mr. Lloyd George stated that the agreement proposed by the British representatives had already been accepted in principle.Professor Mantoux then read a translation into French.Mr. Lloyd George explained that the last few lines of paragraph 4 were based on the actual instructions given by the French Government to General Gouraud when he was in command of the French portion of the Dardanelles Expedition.M. Briand then read the following alternative draft to paragraph 2 of the Conclusions No. (v): &quot; Le Cabinet de Guerre du Gouvernement britannique et le Gonvernement fran^ais, chacun en ce qui concerne sa propre armee, seront juges de la date a laquelle les operations de la campagne envisagee devront etre considerees comme terminees.   Dans ce cas la situation anterieure sera retablie.&quot;Mr. Lloyd George, on behalf of the British Government, accepted M. Briand&apos;s draft.General Nivelle stated that he was fully satisfied with the document as a statement of principle. He felt, however, that it was of the utmost importance now to ensure that it should be executed with the best possible effect. For this reason he asked that a General Officer of high standing should be appointed as the represen-tative of the British Army at his Headquarters, to work with his Operations Department and to establish a permanent and complete liaison. The present liaison, he said, waa somewhat intermittent and unsatisfactory. That was why he had asked for a British 0 Chief of Staff to be attached to his Headquarters. It was not his idea that he should in any way supersede the British Chief of the General Staff, but that he should be there for the purpose of establishing a closer liaison. He insisted with equal urgency on the appointment to the French Headquarters of a representative of the Quarter-[660-19] B
master-General. As an illustration of the need of such an officer, he pointed out that the railway experts who had attended the Conference on the previous evening had not even yet been able to reach an agreement, though they had been in constant conference the previous evening and this morning. General kiggel, who had attended the Conference of the railway experts, had stated that he could not revise his figures, and that he did not profess to understand the requirements of the French Army, which were not his business.Sir Douglas Haig interposing at this point said that this was not quite correct.General Nivelle, continuing, said that no solution had been reached, because there was nobody who could decide between the conflicting parties. This emphasised the need of a representative of the British Quartermaster-General in close touch with the French Commander-in-Chief. Then a responsible person would be able to decide such questions in an emergency.   He considered it to be a very grave matter.Sir Douglas Haig said he would be happy to change the liaison officers now attached to General nivelle&apos;s Headquarters. He himself had a house at Beauvais, and went there as often as he could, but, of course, he could not be there continuously.(At this point there was some discussion between Sir Douglas Haig and General Nivelle as to the railway arrangements.)Mr. Lloyd George said that if Sir Douglas Haig found that he was not being furnished with the means he considered absolutely necessary, he could only do his best to fight with the means at his disposal, but the responsibility for his reduced effort would then, rest with the French Army.General Nivelle said that General kiggel and General Geddes maintained that their figures were not exaggerated, and, of course, he quite understood that Sir Douglas Haig had to rely upon his experts for their advice. These experts maintained that there should be no comparison between the railway requirements of the two Armies, because they were calculated on a different basis. For his part, however, he could not understand this argument, because each Army must require certain totals of tonnage. The British requirements for rolling-stock were three and a half times greater than the French, although the effectives to be employed were only about half those of the French Army. He could understand that there might be a divergence due to a difference in the basis of calculation, but not so great a difference as this.Mr. Lloyd George insisted that General Niyelle and his advisers must tell Sir Douglas Haig exactly how much rolling-stock they could allot. If this total was short of what Sir^ Douglas Haig deemed necessary, then the responsibility for any restriction of effort on the part of the British Army must rest with the French.General Nivelle said that this illustration explained why he required a representative of the Quartermaster-General at his Headquarters.(The Conference accepted in principle General Nivelle&apos;s pivposal for the reorganisation of the British Mission at the French Headquarters, with a Senior Military Officer at the head, as well as a representative of the British Quartermaster-General.)Sir Douglas Haig asked Mr. Lloyd George, in reference to the Agreement, who would be responsible for taking precautionary measures to protect the left o  the British Armies (i.e., the Ypres front) during the period of preparations which is dealt with in paragraph 2 (3) of the Agreement.Mr. Lloyd George stated that Sir Douglas Haig would be responsible.Sir Douglas Haig then handed to the interpreter the following statement, which was read to the Conference : &quot;War is so uncertain that various cases may arise which are not covered by these instructions. As a guide to me in interpreting the spirit of my instructions under unexpected conditions, I ask. for an answer to the following questions : &quot; After the battle under reference in paragraph 2 (4)*&apos; has commenced, and before its conclusion, the enemy may conceivably (however improbably) launch an attack in force elsewhere for- example, against the Ypres front.* Of the Agreement on p. 4.
&quot; If in that case it becomes necessary, in my judgment, to reinforce my front so attacked by withdrawing troops from my offensive operations &quot; (a.) Is it my right to do so, if I judge instant action to be necessary, without waiting to refer to General Nivelle (but, of course, informing him at once) ?&quot;(6.) If I first refer to General Nivelle, and he does not concur in my view, am I to abide by his decision, however certain I feel that I am risking the safety of my Army in doing so ? &quot;Mr. Lloyd George asked what answer General Nivelle could give to the questions contained in Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s statement.General Nivelle said that he had two answers : 1. In case of immediate grave danger locally in the Ypres region, it would be the duty of the local Commanding Officer to face the danger at&quot; once, provided, of course, that he informed the General Officer in charge of the whole of the operations;2. If, however, Ypres was threatened by a great operation, then the safety of the whole Army would be involved. In such a case there would have to he immediate communication with the Commander-in-Chief, who would then decide what troops were to be sent to that region, treating the question as one affecting the Army at large, that is to say, whether it would be necessary to withdraw troops from the offensive or not.Mr. Lloyd George summed up General Nivelle&apos;s reply as follows: If it is an operation affecting the whole plan of campaign, then the responsibility, under the new system, for taking action, would be General nivelle&apos;s. If, however, reinforcements of only two or three divisions were involved, then the responsibility for sending them would rest with Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig.General Nivelle said that this exactly defined the responsibility. If the whole plan of operations would be affected by the size of the reinforcements required, then the Commander-in-Chief would take the responsibility for sending them or refusing them.Sir Douglas Haig said that the difficulty was that prior to the commencement of an offensive by the enemy, you- could not judge whether it would be a great operation or not, so it was necessary to have adequate reserves within reach of any vital point which the enemy was threatening. In this connection he quoted the case of Verdun, when, though it was known ten days before that a hostile attack was impending, no one had been able to judge the scope of the German offensive.General Lyautey said that if we considered details and all the different hypotheses which might arise we should neglect the main principle, which was of importance now. The principles governing the responsibility of the two generals had been stated by the British Prime Minister. Now, however, the question was not solely one of principle. We must also consider the practical consequences arising out of the principle. Whoever says that unity of command must exist must be prepared to provide the means for its operation. Without entering into all details it was necessary to decide the first question that arises, namely, the character of the liaison at the French General Headquarters. There must be a very definite organisation of the liaison arrangements. These arrangements must be in complete working order and ready to work day after day in close concert with the French Commander-in-Chief, so as to enable decisions to be reached. The Commanders-in-Chief must see as much of one another as possible, but they were necessarily too busy to meet very often. The liaison organisation must be strong enough to ensure complete co-operation. Each army should work independently but side by side with, as it were, a common workshop. He was afraid that papers which only stated general principles might become dead papers. We must state clearly the practical results emanating from the principles.Mr. Lloyd George said he was in complete agreement with General Lyautey. The mere vfact of agreeing in principle does not necessarily settle the whole problem. AH depends upon the loyal co-operation of the Commanders-in-Chief. He reminded General Lyautey that when General Nivelle came to London the results of the Conference had been embodied in a piece of paper signed by General Nivelle, Sir William Robertson, and Sir Douglas Haig.   General Nivelle had pointed out, in
the course of the present Conference, that the arrangement then entered into had been carried out a week ahead of the time agreed upon. This had only been possible by the energy and. sincere and resolute spirit which Sir Douglas Haig had shown to carry it out. He felt sure that the loyalty with which that undertaking had been carried out would again be shown in giving effect to the new agreement. He wished to add that the reasons which had prompted the War Cabinet in assenting to these principles were that the plan of operations decided on for the Western Front was a plan proposed by General Nivelle and loyally accepted by Sir Douglas Haig. But in so much as it was &quot;General nivelle&apos;s plan, and in so much as he had twice as many troops engaged in it as Sir Douglas Haig had, he felt that the responsibility must be mainly General Nivelle&apos;s. If the plan did not succeed, then the normal arrangements would be re-established, and we should have to consider, in concert with the French Government, what further action was to be taken.M. Briand proposed that the measures to be taken for giving effect to the principles agreed on at the present Conference, that is to say, the establishment of the British liaison mission at French General Headquarters, should be left to General Nivelle and Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig to carry out.Mr. Lloyd George agreed.(Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig withdrew at this point.)The following is the text of the Agreement reached at this Meeting between the British and French Governments : Agreement signed at Anglo-French Conference held at Calaist February 26 and 27, 1917.1. The French War Committee and the British War Cabinet approve of the plan of operations on the Western Front as explained to them by General Nivelle and Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig on the 26th February, 1917.2. With the object of ensuring complete unity of command during the forth-coming military operations referred to above, the French War Committee and the British War Cabinet have agreed to the following arrangements : (1.) Whereas the primary object of the forthcoming military operations referred to in paragraph 1 is to drive the enemy from French soil, and whereas the French Army disposes of larger effectives than the British, the British War Cabinet recognises that the general direction of the campaign should be in the hands of the French Commander-in-Chief.(2.) With this object in view, the British War Cabinet engages itself to direct the Field-Marshal Commanding the British Expeditionary Force to conform his plans of operation to the general strategical plans of the Commander-in-Chief of the French Army.(3.) The British War Cabinet further engages itself to direct that during the period intervening between the date of the signature of this agreement, and the date of the commencement of the operations referred to in paragraph 1, the Field-Marshal Commanding the British Expeditionary Force shall conform his preparations to the views of the Commander-in-Chief of the French Army, except in so far as he considers that this would endanger the safety of his Army, or prejudice its success, and, in any case where Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig may feel bound on these grounds to depart from General Nivelle&apos;s instructions, he shall report the action taken, together with the reasons for such action, to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, for the information of the&apos; British War Cabinet.(4.) The British War Cabinet further engages itself to instruct the Field-Marshal Commanding the British Expeditionary Force that, after the date of the commencement of the forthcoming operations referred to in paragraph. 1, and up to the termination of these operations, he shall conform to the orders of the Commander-in-Chief of the French Army in all matters relating to the conduct of the operations, it being understood that the British Commander will be left free to choose the means he will employ, and the methods of utilising his troops in that sector of operations allotted to him by the French Commander-in-Chief in the original plan.
(5.) The British War Cabinet and Government and the French Government, each so far as concerns its own Army, will be the judge of the date at which the operations referred to in paragraph 1 are to be considered as at an end. When so ended, the arrangement in force before the commencement of the operations will be re-established.(Signed)     M. BRIAND. (Signed)     LLOYD GEORGE.(Signed)     LYAUTEY.- (Signed)     W. R. ROBERTSON, G.I.G.S.(Signed)     R. NIVELLE. (Signed)     D. HAIG, F.-M.   &apos;Calais, February 27, 1917.Salonica.General Lyautey handed to Mr. Lloyd George a letter which he had received from Lord Derby on the subject of. the relations between General Milne and General Sarrail. He said that he did not quite understand why this letter had been sent to him by Lord Derby.Mr. Lloyd George explained that Lord Derby was Secretary of State for War, and had been asked by the War Cabinet on the 12th February to send this letter to General Lyautey as French Minister of War.General Lyautey then handed Sir William Robertson a copy of his reply.Sir William Robertson undertook to hand it to Lord Derby.General Sarrail&apos;s Plan.M. Briand said that General Sarraif&apos;s plans envisaged two distinct operations : one was an extensive operation, which he recognised could not be carried out with the effectives at General Sarrail&apos;s disposal; the second plan was one more in accordance with the size of his force. He suggested that the second plan ought to be adopted, as the results would be quite sufficiently important to justify his action. He therefore urged the Conference to take a decision in favour of General Sarrail&apos;s second plan.Mr. Lloyd George asked Sir William Robertson to reply on this question.Sir William Robertson said that Mr. Lloyd George and he were in agreement that the first thing to be decided was the scope of General Sarrail&apos;s missibn. General Sarrail&apos;s plan was mainly a matter of tactics regarding which we had not the material to decide. Sir William Robertson explained the nature of the proposed operations, and added at the end that, if they succeeded, the final objective was to be Sofia. As it must be assumed that General Sarrail would not put forward the plan unless he thought it would succeed, it followed that he evidently regarded his mission to be an advance on Sofia. But, for his part, Sir William Robertson did not think that General Sarrail could possibly reach Sofia. It had always been agreed that an advance on Sofia must be combined with an offensive on the part of the Russians and Roumanians across the Roumanian front. He then read the following proposal as the basis of General Sarraif&apos;s mission: &quot;As the co-operation of Russo-Roumanian forces against Bulgaria is not yet possible, the Conference agrees to confirm, the decision of the Rome Conference, and decides that, for the present, the decisive defeat of the Bulgarian Army is not a practical objective, and that the mission of the Allied forces at Salonica is to keep on their front the enemy forces now there.&quot;M. Briand said that he was quite in agreement with Sir William Robertson that it was not possible to envisage, by the sole action of the Salonica force, an advance SO&apos; great as to reach Sofia. Neither at the present time did it appear that the Russo-Roumanians could render very much assistance. He suggested, however, that we should await the return of the Russian Mission, which might throw some light on the subject. Perhaps in the future the Russian Armies might be able to accomplish some-thing. At the present time, however, he agreed that the advance on Sofia must be put aside. He agreed, therefore, that the Salonica Army should only undertake some secondary operation, the object being to contain the enemy for the present. It might be possible, however, that later on there might be some disorganisation or weakening of the Bulgarian Army; for example, in the Monastir region it might be possible to[660-19] C
push on towards Prilep, or even further. It would be advisable to permit this, as it would be an operation of a secondary and local character. He proposed, therefore, to add at the end of General Robertsons formula the words : &quot; and to take advantage of striking the enemy if opportunity offers.&quot;General Lyautey said the text as proposed was satisfactory. But, in his view, we should not be afraid of General Sarraif&apos;s proposal that the final objective should be Sofia. He agreed that there was no chance of a large. operation without a strong advance from the north. Looking at the plan, without thinking of Sofia, he considered it to be a well prepared and wise plan of operations. He could not admit that so large an Army should be allowed to remain inactive. General Sarrail should be allowed to get the most lie could out of his Army. It would be very bad if the enemy saw so great au Army, as it were, under chloral. He pointed to the fine results that had been achieved in Mesopotamia within the last few days, which showed what could be done by moderate efforts. Such efforts might, perhaps, be even more important to the Allies in the Salonica region. He read extracts from the telegram he had sent to General Sarrail after the Rome Conference, showing that he could not expect to receive reinforcements, and must limit his operations accordingly.Mr. Lloyd George said he was in full agreement with General Lyautey.   The&apos; instructions proposed by Sir William Robertson were almost identical with those given to General Maude.   In the latter case Baghdad was not mentioned, but he would not like to exclude the possibility of General Maude reaching Baghdad, if events favoured him.Conclusion.The Conference decided that the role of General SarraiVs Army should be as follows: As the co-operation of the Busso-Roumanian forces against Bulgaria is not yet possible, the Conference agrees to confirm the decision of the Rome Conference, and decides that, for the present, the decisive defeat of the Bulgarian Army is not a practical objective, and that the mission of the Allied forces at Salonica is to keep on their front the enemy forces now there, and to take advantage of striking the enemy if opportunity offers.The Restriction of Imports.Mr. Lloyd George explained to M. Briand the motives which had induced the British Government to adopt the drastic restriction of imports, some of which, he feared, adversely affected French interests. He stated that the restrictions had been decided on with the special object of ensuring that sufficient tonnage was available for the indispensable needs of ourselves and our Allies, and that he hoped that one result would be that the difficulties of providing tonnage to convey coal to France and Italy would be overcome. In fact, the restrictions were adopted in the French interest just as much as in our own. The British people were being subjected to grave inconvenience through these restrictions. The British Government were most, reluctant to give way on any part of the restrictions, as, if they did so, pressure would at once be put on them for corresponding treatment in other quarters, and the restrictions would be rendered, to a great extent, nugatory.M. Briand took note of what Mr. Lloyd George had said, and undertook to represent it to the French Minister of Commerce.

Un Etat-Major general charge de 1&apos;etude des questions d&apos;operations et desrapports avec le Comite de Guerre britannique. (b.) Le Quartermaster-General.II sera charge de tenir le Comite de Guerre britannique au courant de la situation des Armees britanniques, et de lui transmettre les demandes emanant du Commandant en Chef francais au sujet des besoins de ces Armees.II transmettra au Commandant en Chef britannique, aux Commandants d&apos;Armee ou de Groupe d&apos;Armees operant isolement, les directives et instructions du Commandant en. Chef francais.Sous 1&apos;autorite du Chef d&apos;Etat-Major general, le Quartermaster-General sera charge de repartir les ressources de toute nature entre les Armees britanniques, et de donner au Directeur general des Transports les instructions necessaires a son service.3. Les questions de personnel et de discipline generale dans les Armees britanniques seront reglees par le Commandant en Chef britannique, les Commandants d&apos;Armee ou de Groupe d&apos;Armees operant isolement, et le Chef d&apos;$tat-Major general britannique, suivant les attributions qui lui seront fixees par le War Office.4.

L&apos;unite de commandement n&apos;est-elle pas assuree, si le Commandant en Chef francais a autorite pour le plan et 1&apos;execution des actions militaires et le Commandant en Chef britannique ne peut-il garder la liberte du groupement de ses forces et de la repartition des moyens materiels ?Non, parce que le plan et 1&apos;execution des actions militaires dependent essentielle-ment du groupement de forces et de la repartition des moyens materiels. Celui qui commande doit en etre le maitre.Exemple: Actuellement le Marechal Haig et le General Nivelle sont d&apos;accord sur le plan de 1&apos;offensive prochaine, et personne ne peut les departager en ce qui conceme les moyens de transport par voie ferree necessaires aux Armees britanniques.Paragraphe 2. Pourquoi le Quartermaster-General ne reste-t-il pas sous les ordres de Commandaat em Chef britannique ?Parce qu&apos;il doit 6tre sous les ordres du Chef d&apos;$tat-Major general pour la repartition des moyens materiels conformement aux directives du Commandant en Chef francais, et parce qu&apos;il faut qu&apos;il puisse desservir des Armees ou Groupes d&apos;Armees anglaises isolees.H y en aura done.Cest tres possible et il faut le prevoirjsans cela dans la suite des operations on, n&apos;aura aucune souplesse.

His impression was that the two Commanders-in-Chief were now very near an agreement. They had just withdrawn in order to discuss their strategical plans at the War Office. Mr. Lloyd George then proceeded to describe the arrangements he had made with Field-Marshal Haig and General Nivelle. Sir Douglas Haig had agreed to nominate General Sir Henry Wilson as head of the Liaison Mission at[660-20] B
General Nivelle&apos;s Headquarters. General Nivelle had drafted some instructions defining the duties of the Head of the Liaison Mission. These instructions had now been finally agreed to. Only one point in General Nivelle&apos;s draft had been materially w altered, namely, that the Head of the Liaison Mission, instead of reporting direct to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, should report to Field-Marshal Haig. General Nivelle, Mr. Lloyd George understood, had attached more importance to settling this question of the Liaison Mission than to anything else.Another point which Mr. Lloyd George said had been discussed with the two Commanders-in-Chief was that Sir Douglas Haig had asked for certain conditions, such as that General Nivelle should not come to inspect his troops, nor give orders to his subordinate Commanders. It had transpired, however, that General Nivelle himself had no idea of doing anything of the kind, and that matter had been set right.After this they had entered on a more difficult ground in a discussion of the exact relations of the two Commanders-in-Chief during the battle. General Nivelle wanted to have command of the British reserves, so that he could use them if he broke through at any point. This undoubtedly was the intention of the Calais Agreement. Sir Douglas Haig, however, had. interpreted the Calais Agreement as meaning that General Nivelle would be enabled to take the British troops and place them among the French troops, making an amalgam on the lines proposed by M. Reinach. Mr. Lloyd George had therefore himself suggested that words should be inserted in the Agreement between the two Generals to prevent the British Army from being mixed up with the French Army. A phrase had also been inserted to provide that General Nivelle should have command of the British reserves in case he broke through the German line.Sir Douglas Haig had wished to put in the Agreement a phrase similar to that in paragraph 2 (3) to the effect that during the battle the reserves should only be taken &quot; provided that the security of the British Army was not threatened.&quot; Mr. Lloyd George, however, had felt that this would destroy the Calais Agreement, and could not sanction the proposal.General Lyautey said that the words in paragraph 2 (3) of the Calais Agreement, &quot; except in so far as he considers this would endanger the safety of his Army, or prejudice its success,&quot; had always appeared to him to be dangerous, and he was glad that they were to be removed.Mr. Bonar Law pointed out, however, that these words remained in clause 2 (3) of the Agreement, covering the period prior to the commencement of the offensive.M. Ribot insisted that even during the preparatory period it should be clearly laid down that the preparations did not come to a stop owing to the fact that Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig reported that General nivelle&apos;s proposals would endanger the safety of the Army.Lord Gurzon pointed out that, from some of the letters that had been circulated, it would appear that General Nivelle was communicating with Sir Douglas Haig in a manner which seemed to indicate that he regarded the Field-Marshal as under his orders even in this stage.Mr. Lloyd George said that this was another point which had arisen in his discussions with the two Commanders-in-Chief. He had urged that, unless there was goodwill, any Agreement would be a failure. He had pointed out that the two first documents sent by General Nivelle to Sir Douglas Haig, after the signature of the Calais Agreement, were couched in rather peremptory tones. As he had expected, however, it had transpired that these letters were not written by General Nivelle himself, but by some subordinate. He had reminded General Nivelle that Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s command extended over more than 1^ million men, and was the largest British Army, by far, that had ever existed. He had further pointed out that Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig possessed the full confidence of the War Cabinet, and was regarded with admiration in England, and, he believed, in France also. He had,&apos; therefore, told General Nivelle that, in his opinion, these two documents were somewhat brusque. General Nivelle, in reply, had stated that nothing was further from his mind than to show the smallest discourtesy to Field-Marshal f Sir Douglas Haig. Mr. Lloyd George himself recognised that General Nivelle was the very last man to do anything discourteous, and everyone in England who had met him had been struck with his great courtesy.   The point, therefore, which he wished to
impress on the French Government was the danger that subordinate officials are    * sometimes indiscreet.   He further wished to emphasise that it was not only the letter of the Agreement which was of importance, but equally the spirit in which it was carried out.General Lyautey said that he had himself observed that General Nivelle&apos;s communications had a somewhat brusque tone before Mr. Lloyd George wrote.M. Thomas said that the whole of the French War Committee were agreed on this point.General Lyautey said that he had suggested to General Nivelle that he should not send any document to the British General Headquarters without making sure that it was drafted by an officer who was not only a good and competent officer, but one who was careful in the choice of his words in addressing the British Headquarters.Admiral Lacaze said that what Mr. Lloyd George had said corresponded entirely with the feeling of the French Ministers. For himself, he would like to add that either Commander-in-Chief, in the event of his receiving any document that was perhaps hastily drafted, and was couched in terms calculated to give offence, instead of remaining sullenly dissatisfied, should seek an early interview with the other Commander-in-Chief, in order to clear the matter up.M. Ribot said that from the Calais Agreement it seemed to follow that if, in Sir Douglas Haigs opinion, any decision of General Nivelle&apos;s during the period of preparation affected the security of the British Army, all the preparations would come to a standstill while he communicated with the British. Government. He suggested that it would be better, instead of stopping everything, to provide that Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig should not suspend action while he communicated with the British Government. In fact, that he should at once initiate the action to carry out General nivelle&apos;s decisions while he communicated with the British Government, who should give their decision, if possible, within an hour or two.Mr. Balfour pointed out that this implied that Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig would have the right of appeal to the British Government, but, in the meanwhile, w ould have to go on with preparations in accordance with General Nivelle&apos;s decisions.Mr. Lloyd George pointed out that no such case had, as far as he knew, arisen up to the present.Mr. Bonar Law questioned whether this was a real danger.(This question was postponed for further consideration on the following day, whenthe Generals would be present.The French Railways.Lord Milner said that he supposed that all present are agreed that it was of the utmost importance to take this opportunity of clearing away any misunderstanding that might possibly divide the two nations. When the questions which had already been alluded to had been settled, he believed there was only one great outstanding question between the two countries, namely, that of the railways. This question was intended to have been the principal subject to be decided at Calais on the 26th and 27th February, but owing to the introduction of the larger question of the responsibility of the two Commanders-in-Chief, the Conference had not had time to settle it. The technical experts had retired to formulate questions on which they required the decision of the Governmental Conference, but this latter Conference had not had time to settle the matter.M. Ribot said it was extremely difficult to discuss this highly technical matter without, the railway experts. He pointed out that the Chemin de Fer du Nord was in a terrible condition. The French only had one main line on this system in their hands, with the result that much traffic had to be run over local lines that were not equal to it. Already there were complaints on the part of the civil population. The French Government had considered the possibility of evacuating the civil population and of closing down. [660-20] * ^ B 2m
the mines and factories, but it was not practicable. If they had known the question, would be raised, they would have brought their technical experts with them.Lord Milner said that Major-General Sir Eric Geddes had given him&apos; the figures. We had been told that we could have 200 trains a day to railhead from ports or depots. On that allowance all our calculations had been based. He blamed no one, but he was bound to point out that now we were told we could only have 200 trains for fifteen days after the commencement of the offensive, and that after that we should have to be content with 120 trains a day. This had completely upset all our calculations. The failure to meet our requirements was especially fatal to the arrangements for prolonging the railways in the event of an advance. Hence if we were to break the enemy&apos;s line we should be unable to pursue our advance.M. Ribot said that the French had exactly the same goodwill in the matter as we had, but they were met with the fact that it was impossible to do more.General Lyautey insisted that it was impossible to discuss this question in any detail without the presence of technical experts. If he had known the question was to be raised he would have brought M. Olaveille and General Ragueneau with him. At present he was unable to discuss any question of figures. He was able to state, however, that already some changes had been made in the Direction of the Chemin de Fer du Nord, and colossal efforts were being made at this very moment. He hoped that this would produce good results. He held strongly, however, that this question could not be dealt with by conferences held now and then, but that it could only be solved by the establishment of a permanent Anglo-French Bureau at Beauvais. He also thought that there should be an agent in the Bureau at Paris to follow the questions up. What he aimed at was a continuous reciprocal examination of the question, both from the point of view of our requirements and the means of execution.Mr. Lloyd George said that this was included in the new instructions with regard to the Liaison Mission at General nivelle&apos;s Headquarters. He understood there was to be a Quartermaster-General^ Staff at Beauvais. Mr. Lloyd George then asked whether any attempt had been made to discover the reason of the alleged difference in the number of trains required by the British and French respectively for the offensive.Lord Derby said that Major-General Sir Eric Geddes had explained to him that the two sets of figures given at Calais were not comparable. The English figures included the following items that were not included in the French calculations, namely: Ambulance trains, reinforcements, stone for metal, and trains to convey railway material.Hence, to compare the figures was impossible. So far as munitions were concerned, he had discovered that the requirements of the two armies were practically identical. The trains we are now allotted only suffice to supply munitions; provisions, and engineers&apos; stores; hence, we were able only to send up enough material to maintain a defensive line, and had no trains for railway and road material required for an advance.General Lyautey again insisted that these questions ought to be discussed in a common bureau.M. Thomas stated that these statements led to certain reflections on our means for the offensive and the desirability of adjusting them to possibilities. General Nivelle, he understood, proposed to make very extensive use of automobiles in the event of his breaking the line. Then there was the question of obtaining ballast for the railways from local sources. The study of these questions was one which might, and ought to be, taken up by the organisation proposed by General Lyautey. In fact, the whole of these questions in the rearward services of the Army ought to be studied by this Bureau.Lord Derby said that no comparison of figures would solve the difficulties.   We knew exactly what we required, namely, so many wagons for ammunitions, so many for provisions, so many for engineers&apos; stores, and so many for materials to extend our railways, and for ballast.    Hence, at present, we only had enough wagons for , supplying the existing needs of the Army, but not enough to carry up the railway * material to prolong our lines to the front. t(At this point General Geddes entered the room.)
Admiral Lacaze stated that there seemed to him to he two entirely different questions : one was a question of principle, and on this there was no doubt that France would desire to put at the disposal of the British all the wagons they could; the other was a question of detail, namely, as to whether, if France could not supply all that the British Army require, what steps we should take to substitute instead motor transport, to procure ballast from local sources, &amp;c. It was this question of detail that could so usefully be studied by the Bureau proposed by General Lyautey.- Mr. Lloyd George at this point enquired exactly what point Lord Derby wished the War Cabinet to impress upon the French representatives.Lord Derby stated that he only asked for a guarantee of 200 trains a day from now and during the battle, and that these 200 trains should have precedence over everything else.Mr. Balfour said that he hoped we had made it clear that there was a grave danger that our offensive would be seriously limited without the provision -of this railway material.Mr. Lloyd George then invited General Lyautey to give his personal attention to the matter as soon as he reached Paris.Lord Curzon proposed that Lord Derby should go to iParis, together with his railway experts, to confer with General Lyautey.General Lyautey said the matter was not entirely in jhis hands. It was a matter for the Minister of Public Works.   Nevertheless, he would take the matter up.M. Ribot said^that it was a first-rate interest of the French Government to settle the question satisfactorily. He repeated, however, that it was not a question of goodwill, hut one of possibility. He felt great doubt whether we could suspend the life of the civil population.Lord Milner said that, while he recognised it would be quite impossible to stop the whole of the civil traffic over the Chemin de Fer du Nord, yet, nevertheless, perhaps some reduction might be made in civil traffic in other parts of France also. If this could be done, it would enable us to meet our immediate necessities. Before very long we ourselves should be able to supply sufficient engines and rolling-stock to meet all our requirements. It was during the next few weeks that our difficulties were so great, and he hoped that the French Government would be able to come to our assistance.General Lyautey said that we should get nothing practical done unless the Joint Bureau which he had proposed was organised at once. He saw no use in further intermittent Conferences. Immediately he returned, he proposed to ask M. Claveille and General Ragueneau to meet General Geddes and set up the Bureau once and for all.Sir Eric Geddes stated that, in his opinion&apos;, nothing would be gained by the establishment of a Bureau. So long as the French had the management of the Chemin de Fer du Nord, it was impossible for us to share it or to he responsible in any way for it. In his opinion, the French Government should give the guarantees we asked for, namely, to provide 200 trains.Lord Derby said that, if he went to France he would not be willing to discuss how many trucks we could do with. The only question he could discuss with the French Government was, how they were to be supplied, not merely for a fortnight, but for as long as the offensive lasts.M. Thomas said we were all agreed on the importance of doing all we can. He could not, however, accept General Geddes&apos;s point of view. As regards the 200 trains, the difficulty was the dependence of the French on the few remaining coalfields in the north. Even if they gave the guarantee that was asked for, no doubt from time to time they would have to desist for days from supplying the full number of trains in order to meet particular emergencies. In such a case, the Bureau proposed by General Lyautey would have great usefulness.Mr. Lloyd George said that he trusted the French Government to do their best, particularly in&apos; view of the fact that in a few months&apos; time the measures we had taken for the reduction of imports and the restriction in railway traffic would set free large
oquantities of engines and rolling-stock. Our difficulties were, he believed, only temporary. He therefore repeated the proposal that Lord Derby should proceed to Paris to discuss the question with General Lyautey and the railway authorities..M. Ribot accepted this proposal on behalf of the French Government. (The Conference then adjourned until 10*30 on the following day.)2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., March 13, 1917.

After this they had a short discussion on the question of the employment of prisoners of war within the zone of operations, but General Lyautey explained that the question could not really be settled in the absence of General Nivelie and Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, whose arrangements might be materially-affected by the decision of the Conference. [660-21] B
After the arrival of General Nivelle, Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, and General Sir William Robertson, the Conference resumed their discussion of the question of the relations of the two Commanders-in-Chief resulting from the Calais Agreement of the 27th February, 1917.]General Nivelle announced that he and Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig and General Sir William Robertson were fully agreed, except on one point. This exception was the hypothetical danger raised by the French War Committee that under paragraph 2 (3) of the Calais Agreement Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig was entitled to stop all preparations to carry out General nivelle&apos;s plans while he appealed to the British War Cabinet. The idea of the French War Committee was that he should be bound by the Agreement to continue his preparations during reference to the British War Cabinet.He then read the following clause which he had drafted in order to carry out the ideas of the French War Committee : &quot; Le Cpmite de Guerre britannique s&apos;engage, en outre, a donner les instructions nebessaires pour que,, pendant la periode comprise entre la signature de cet Accord et la date preVue au paragraphe 1 pour le commencement des operations, le Feld-Marecha&apos;l Commandant les Forces expeditionnaires britanniques se conforme, pour la preparation de ces attaques, aux projets du Commandant en Chef frangais. Dans le cas oil le Commandant en Chef britannique aurait des observations a presenter sur les mesures demandees par le Commandant en Chef francos, il pourrait en reference a son Gouvernement, mais, toutefois, sans suspendre Fexecution de ces mesures.&quot;Sir Douglas Haig, in reply to Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s request for him to explain his views, stated that, in fact, he had continued his preparations while referring to the War Cabinet. He insisted, however, that there must be confidence on both sides/ The man on the spot must always decide whether a particular order could be carried out without danger to the force under his command. (hi this point discretion was invariably left to subordinate officers. Hence, though he would loyally endeavour to carry out General nivelle&apos;s instructions, discretion must be left to him on this point.M. Ribot said that; this was quite understood. The presumption, however, must be that Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig would carry out General nivelle&apos;s instructions. There were, of course, exceptions in case, of great emergency to any rule.Mr. Lloyd George said that, if this was M. Ribot&apos;s opinion, it would seem that all were now in agreement. It was impossible, he said, to insert words in the Agreement to cover every conceivable contingency. There was only one thing which would cover every contingency, that was goodwill with thorough co-operation. He felt sure that this would exist between General Nivelle and Field-Marshal Haig.General Nivelle said he was quite in agreement in regard to this.Mr. Lloyd George said that he understood the decision of the Conference to be that the words of paragraph 2 (3) of the Calais Agreement referring to the stage preparatory to the offensive should stand, but that they should be interpreted in the words of Field-Marshal Haig, which he understood were accepted by M. Ribot.M. Ribot asked that Field-Marshal Haig&apos;s interpretation might be restated, in order that he might be quite clear about it. As he understood the matter, Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig agreed that the rule should be for him to continue his preparations without stopping while he referred to the British War Cabinet, but that this did not apply in a case of extreme danger, as in such cases the man on the spot must himself take his decision.General Nivelle said that Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s theory could not be disputed, because the most famous victory of the British Army, namely, that at Waterloo, had been due to the fact that General Crouchy had carried out his orders literally instead of interpreting them according to the local situation.M. ThomasRecalled the disquietude of the French War Committee when they had read Field Marshal Haig&apos;s Memorandum, which had seemed to indicate that there would be a delay in the preparations for the attack owing to Sir Douglas Haigs apprehensions regarding the safety of the 2nd Army.
Mr. Lloyd George said that he understood that Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig had not, in fact, arrested his preparations on account of his Memorandum. The preparations were in full progress the whole time. The question raised in the Memorandum bad been one of strategy, which was for the two Generals to decide. He wished to lay emphasis on the fact, however, that Field-Marshal Haig had never -delayed his preparations for a single hour.M. Thomas said that although this might not have been the case, nevertheless the incident indicated the danger that it might occur again.General Nivelle admitted that the text of paragraph&apos;2 (3) of the Calais Agreement contained elements of danger. At the same time he wished to point out that he and Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig had never differed seriously on the main strategical issue, as Sir Douglas Haigs letter had crossed one from him and the two letters showed that they were in accord as to the steps to be taken.Lord Gurzon said that it appeared to him that, in fact, there was a complete -agreement, which might be expressed as follows : In the cases referred to in paragraph 2 (3) of the Calais Agreement, Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig will, as a general rule, continue his preparations, and in exceptional cases only will he hold himself at liberty to suspend his operations pending a decision by the British War Cabinet.General Nivelle reminded the Conference of Napoleon&apos;s dictum, that every General who executes an order which does not meet the existing situation should be executed.Admiral Lacaze associated himself with the views of M. Thomas. The reason why the French War Committee had attached so much importance to the settlement of this question was their belief in the necessity, not only of an offensive, but of an early offensive.M. Thomas asked whether it was necessary to retain the text of paragraph 2 (3) of the Calais Agreement.Mr. Lloyd George replied in the affirmative. He understood the Conference to be agreed that the text should be retained, but was to be interpreted in the manner suggested by M. Ribot and Lord Curzon, and accepted by Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig and General Nivelle. This interpretation was only accepted in principle, but, in fact, had already been put in execution by Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, who had continued his preparations while referring to the British War Cabinet. The inter-pretation was that only in very exceptional cases would he suspend his preparations during reference to the British War Cabinet.M. Ribot said that General Nivelle had proposed to him that this interpretation of the Calais Agreement should be formulated in a protocol to be initialled by and exchanged between the two Commanders-in-Chief.Admiral Lacaze agreed that the main object in view was that. the two &apos;CoLimianders-in-Chief should agree among; themselves.The Plans for 1917.Sir William Robertson said that he and Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig and General Nivelle had held a meeting the previous evening and had met again this morning. They had reached complete agreement in regard to the establishment, functions, and composition of the British Mission at French General Headquarters. They were also fully agreed about the plans of operations.General Nivelle agreed.The Relations of the two Commanders-in-Chief.M. Ribot said that, in conclusion, he wished to ask that it might be recorded in the proces-verbal of the meeting that the French Government had proposed modifications of paragraph 2 (3) of the Calais Agreement, but that, after discussion, it had been considered unnecessary to alter the text, provided that it was understood that the said paragraph should be interpeted in the sense that Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig would, as a general rule, continue his preparations to carry out General Nivelle&apos;s plans
pending reference to the War Cabinet, and should only suspend his preparations in very-exceptional cases in which he considered the safety of his Army would be endangered at once.Lord Curzon demurred to this suggestion. He pointed out that the fact of recording the proposals of the French Government in this form would seem to indicate that we are only carrying them out in another way, whereas, in fact, we were adhering to the Calais Agreement.M. Ribot insisted that his statement should be recorded, because it was important that the proces-verbal should explain how the Conference had reached this concluson, namely, because the two Commanders-in-Chief were in agreement in regard to it,Mr. Lloyd George agreed with M. Ribot that his statement must certainly appear in the proces-verbal, which is merely a summary of the discussion.M. Ribot then read the following draft conclusion proposed by M. Cambon: &quot;L&apos;article 2 (3) du Protocole de Calais a donne lieu h, un echange de vues qui a permis d&apos;en preciser 1&apos;interpretation dans un document ci-annexe&apos; qui sera signe des deux Generaux en Chef.&quot;Mr. Lloyd George suggested that the best plan would be to have a new Protocol to he signed by the two, Commanders-in-Chief embodying the arrangements agreed to at this Conference.   He understood that there was now complete agreement.M. Ribot and M. Thomas said that they were now all&apos; agreed in principle.Mr. Lloyd George said he wished to make - it quite clear that the words read by General Nivelle at the beginning of the meeting in his draft protocol would not remain, but would be replaced by a fresh clause which would explain the interpretation to be put on the Calais Agreement.General Nivelle agreed.The Employment of Prisoners of War in the Fighting Zone.Lord Derby reminded the Conference that the Germans had notified us that if we did not move our prisoners of war to a distance of 30 kilom. behind the line they would send our prisoners to work practically close to the firing line. We had replied that we would not employ them nearer than within 20 kilom. of the firing line, and we understood this to be the same rule as had been adopted by the French. The Germans, however, had refused to accept this proposal, and insisted on the 30 kilom. He would like to know the attitude of the French Government on the subject.General Nivelle said that he could not alter the 20 kilom. rule, as it was important for the French Army to have this labour.Sir Douglas Haig said that he did not even agree to 20 kilom. He said that we had actually employed prisoners of war on work within 5 miles of the fighting line, though they were not exposed to shell-fire. He attached great importance to the employment of these prisoners of war.Mr Balfour asked whether, if the Germans carried out their threat we should do the same.M. Thomas said that this was merely a sort of blackmail. The Germans had, in fact, employed French prisoners of war behind the line long ago, and on one occasion there had been a veritable massacre of them from French fire.Mr. Lloyd George asked if this meant that the French Government would defy the Germans.M. Ribot said that that was the inclination of the French War Committee.Conclusion.The Conference agreed that we could not accept the German proposal not to employ their prisoners of war within 30 kilom. of the firing line. As the Germans had rejected our offer not to employ them within 20 kilom. of the firing line, this offer lapsed, and we were at liberty to utilise German prisoners of war as we thought fit.
M. ribot  said that, in conclusion, he wished to impress upon the British War Cabinet that the French War Committee considered it of the utmost importance that our preparations for the offensive should be pushed on as rapidly as possible.Sir Douglas Eaig stated that he was in entire agreement with this view.M. ribot  said that the Conference had not been useless, because it had shown that *the two Governments were working together with all their means to the same goal.Mr. Lloyd George agreed. He said that the importance of this Conference was due not merely to the written document to be signed by the two Commanders-in-Chief, but because of the complete agreement which he believed it had brought about.M. Ribot said that nothing had happened to alter the general plan agreed upon by the two Commanders-in-Chief and approved at Calais. General Nivelle was quite willing to explain the modifications in detail made in this plan, if the British War Cabinet desired.Mr. Lloyd George stated, that the War Cabinet did not wish to hear the plans, and were quite satisfied if the two Commanders-in-Chief were in agreement. He reminded the Conference that the hopes of the two nations were vested in the two Generals. Their plans would be a hundred times more effective if they were in entire agreement.   He, therefore, relied on both to maintain complete agreement.General Lyautey said he would like the Conference to offer a suggestion to two Commanders-in-Chief, namely, that it was more important for them to meet case of any disagreement, than it was for the two Governments to have to meet settle the question with them.  In his experience, it was very difficult to settle questions by correspondence, and a personal meeting was all-important.(This view was accepted by the Conference.)2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., &quot;March 13, 1917.Accord entee le Marechal Sie Douglas Haig et le general Nivelle pour l&apos;Appltcation de la Convention de Calais du 27 Feveiee, 1917.I.Rapports entre les Commandants en Chef francais et britannique.1.

Le Commandant des forces ainsi detachees pourra, pendant la duree de sa mission, recevoir directement du Haut Commandement frangais des ordres concernant les operations.[660-21] C
Attributions de la Mission anglaise aupres du G.Q.G. francais.1. Comme prdcddemment, la Mission anglaise aupres du G.Q.G. frangais a pour but d&apos;assurer la liaison entre le Commandant en Chef frangais et le Commandant en Chet britannique.Le Commandant en Chef frangais peut employer les membres de la Mission a dtudier et a rddiger les instructions, qui sont ensuite envoyees sous sa signature.En principe, toutes instructions et communications envoyees a Sir Douglas Haig seront signers par le General Nivelle.

I agree with the above on the understanding that, while I am fully determined to carry out the Calais Agreement in spirit and letter, the British Army and its Commander-in-Chief will be regarded by General Nivelle as Allies and not as subordinates, except during the particular operations which he explained at the Calais Conference.Further, while I also accept the Agreement respecting the functions of the British Mission at French Headquarters, it should be understood that these functions may be subject to modifications, as experience shows to be necessary.D. HAIG, F.-M.Agreement between Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig and General Nivelle on the Application of the Calais Convention of the 27th February, 1917.I.    .Relations between the French and British Commanders-in-Chief.1. The French Commander-in-Chief will only communicate with the authorities of the British Army through an intermediary of the British Commander-in-Chief. This arrangement does not apply to the relations between neighbouring groups of Armies or Armies, nor to the carrying out of the duties of the French Mission, such as they are, at the present time.2. The French Commander-in-Chief receives from the British Commander-in-Chief information as to his operation orders as well as all information respecting their execution.The operation orders of subordinate units are communicated to one another by neighbouring units in conformity with the usual custom, as required by the necessities of war.3. All the British troops stationed in France remain in all circumstances under the orders of their own chiefs and of the British Commander-in-Chief. If the development of the operations should cause the French Commander-in-Chief to ask the British Commander-in-Ohief to use a part of his forces for an action independent of the rest of the British Army, the British Commander-in-Chief will do his utmost to -satisfy this demand. The Commander of the Forces thus detached may receive, as long as his independent position lasts, direct orders respecting operations from the French Higher Command.II.Duties of the British Mission Attached to the French Headquarters.1. As before, the object of the British Mission attached to the French Headquarters is to maintain touch between the French and British Commanders-in-chief.The French Commander-in-Chief can employ the members of the Mission in studying and in drawing up the instructions which are afterwards sent under his signature.In principle, all instructions and communications sent to Sir Douglas Haig will be signed by General Nivelle. In case of absence or in an emergency, they may be signed by the Chief of the Staff or by the Chief of the British Mission acting by delegation of the French Commander-in-Chief.2. The duties of the Chief of the British Mission at the French Headquarters are as follows(a.) In Respect to the British Commander-in-Chief.To keep him informed of the intentions of the French Commander-in-Chief, and to transmit to him his directions ; to keep him informed of the situation of the French Armies and the development of their operations.To keep him informed of the resources of every kind which the French Higher Command can place at the disposal of the British Armies, as well as of the period in which the demands of the British Higher Command can receive satisfaction.
(b.) In Respect to the French commander-in-Chief.To keep him informed as to tho genera] situation ot the British Armies in Franceand as to the intentions of the Commander-in-Chief of these armies. To keep him informed of the orders given to the British Armies in France for thepreparation and execution of the plans of operations, as well as the way inwhich the operations are developing. To keep him informed in good time as to the material situation in every respectof the British Armies in France and as to their needs, in order that he maybe able to satisfy the latter in so far as he is concerned.The Chief of the Mission has under his orders two General Officers charged, one&apos; with the study of questions of operations, the other with the study of questions respecting the administrative services, and a certain number of staff officers.3. The General Officer charged under the direction of the Chief of the Mission with questions of operation will have as his particular duty to study in detail the plans and orders of operations and to follow their execution, so as to be able to supply his chief with the necessary information for the accomplishment of. his task, both with respect to the French Higher Command and with respect to the British Higher-Command.He will keep in constant touch with the Third Bureau of the French General Staff and with the Operations Section of the British General Staff.4. The General Officer charged under the direction of the Chief of the Mission, with questions concerning administrative services has the duty Of&quot; knowing the resources and the needs of the British Armies as well as the means placed at their disposal by the French Higher Command, and, in particular, transport and labour.Of foreseeing in good time the problems relating to those questions which may arise from the development of operations and of studying their solution.He will keep in constant touch on the one hand with the French D. A., and, on the-other hand, with the British Quartermaster-General and Director of Transport.5. The Staff Officers attached to the aforesaid General Officers will be charged with the work of the Staff and with the &quot;liaison&quot; which their respective Missions entail.R NIVELLE.London, March 13, 1917.I agree with the above on the understanding that, while I am fully determined to carry out the Calais Agreement in spirit and letter, the British Army and its Commander-in-Chief will be regarded by General Nivelle as Allies and not as-subordinates, except during the particular operations which he explained at the Calais Conference.Further, while I also accept the Agreement respecting the functions of the British Mission at French Headquarters, it should be understood that these functions may be subject to modifications as experience shows to be necessary.D.
