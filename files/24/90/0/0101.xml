farm buildings.   It is hoped that the greater oart of the potato crop at this Settlement rill be ce cured by the end of the present month.   The delay in proocbdim with the building required at Heath Hill is still holding vv the provision of further small holdings at this Settlement*   The Office o&apos;f &quot;works have now inserted an advertise-ment in the local papers asking for tenders,   A visit has been paid to Amesbury during the -/e^k for the purpose of selecting sites for additional cottages.   About 3 30 acres of wheat have been sen at this Settlement to date-   40 pores of potatoes have still to be dug-. All five holdings at Bos bury have nov,&apos; been token up by ex-officers and the provision of further holdings is being delayed by the absence of any suitable accommodat:;on   The Office of iforfcs have not yet commenced the building: of the hutments required at this Settlement.At Be] les ton, 100 acres of v/heat have nov been soim, as well as about 10 acres each of winter oats and beans.   Two additional probationers joined the Settlement at Berwick St* James during the t/eek.   40 acred of wheat have been sov;n at this settlement.   The Director at Cartage is continuing&apos; to buy in stools.   He has nov arranged a milk coat /act vitli Messrs. Edwards of London, and will commence delivery due lug therprasent week.   A visit has been paid ?ilth a representatives of the Office of Works, to the Parrn Settlement at Titchfield, in order that full specifications of the repairs required to the existing buildings may be taken and sites selected for the new cottages required.provision of Land for Allotments.In consequence of the decision of the Epping Sorest Committee of the City Corporation to require all allotment holders to give up possession at the end of this year,, the Board considered it desirable to obtain a full report from one of their Inspectors as to the position locally.   This officer;s report v/ent to show that it jould be possible for a portion of the laud 1st in allotments to be so retained for a longer period without interfering to any appreciable extent with the provision of facilities for sports and organised ,*ames.A copy of this report was sent to the City Solicitor, andthe lipping 2orest Committee were pressed to agree to receive a deputation from local allotment holders and representatives of Local Authorities.   The Board fdiced up their letter by arranging for two of their officers to interview the City solicitor and&apos;urge that in justice to the allotmsnt holders and&apos;from the point of view of food production it was desirable for the City Corporation to come into line with the London County Council who are allowing 54$ of the allotments in London Parks to continue until blst December, 1920, and with the Office of works who are permitting 10p oi the ilotments in Royal Parks to continue until 28th February 1921.*The lipping forest Committee agreed to receive a deputation from the Local Authorities and the allotment holders concerned. Deputations from the representatives of Liast Ham and Leyton were accordingly received on the 13-th ist *   She Committee have, however, since informed the Board that they see no reason to depart from their previous decision, namely, that the land must be surrendered at the one of the present year.   This decision is in tho 3oard&apos;s opinion most regrettable   from every point of view, but they have lo power to override it.^ Weston
Weston-3upcr-Karo.   Application having &quot;been made by tho Weston-sup^DT-Iwarc Urban District Council to the Board for their consent, under section 22 of the Land Settlement (Facilities) Act, 1919, to the ippropriation for the purpose of the erection of houses for the Working jlasses of a certain piece of land, in extent - .4,872 acres, which had ieen purchased by the Council in 1912 for allotments under the Small loldings and Allotments Act, 1908, the matter was referred to a Sub-;ommissioner for a report.     It was ascertained that the land in question ra,s situated about one mile from the eastern end of tho town, and that there had not, even during tho War, been any demand for it for allotments.     In these circumstances the Board decided to accord their :on3ent to the proposed appropriation.,Land ^Dr a.i nag e^River Ouse Dredging.        The second Priestman dredger arrived at lenver Sluice on 17th inst. and will be put to work immediately after icing tested.     The first dredger is working satisfactorily and is ligging a 50 ft. channel upwards from the sluice with a bell-mouth lead to the sluice.     The material so far dredged has been placed on the eastern bank and is being disposed of on that bank by means of a light railway.     While this is in progress the dredger is working on the western side of the river and disposing spoil at the extremity of the western bank.     In several places timber, trees, remains of old bridges aid other debris   which have been long at the bottom of the river are rendering dredging difficult.     In future the amount dredged each week dll be given in these reports.     The whole of the sections for the third dredger have been delivered at King!s Lynn and the craft is now ieing erected there.The autumn weather conditions make further v;ork in the tideway below King&apos;s Lynn impracticable and the work of the dredger &quot;Chatham&quot; will therefore be stopped this week.Orders.   The following Orders under Part I of the Land Drainage tot 1918, have been confirmed:-Jonington Drainage Order - formation of new district (Hunts.). Somerset Commission of Sewers Order - extension of area. Jverton Commission of Sewers Order - extension of area (Lancashire). lutWell and wimbotsham Drainage Order - increase of rating powers.Land Reclamation.The Wash. Shore.     The bonus described in the&apos;report for weekaiding September 16th, has now been in operation for three full weeks, and has given excellent results.     The maximur: bonus paid out so far has ben 11s.8d. per man;    the output of the men has -been increased by about 100/0 and the cost to the Board per cubic yard of bank has been reduced by almost one half.Arrangements have been made for starting another working face of the bank at the Friskney end as soon as men are available. he depot hut3 have been erected, profiles set up, and some turf stripping iaa been done . .The total number of men employed during the week was 73.Arrangements ha^e been made with the Jimployment &quot;Sxohangc at Boston to circulate particulars of the vacancy for 300 men to all kchanges.i Si nc e

Arrangements for their disposal are being made.?5Il&apos;hjL.    The Engineer in charge of the detailed survey has released the Ordnance Surveyors, but is remaining at Borth pending the termination of.his appointment to finish his observations and levels so that they may form a complete record.1 y 2 .u.Commons, LCopyhold and^Survey.During the past week 25 applications for redemption, 8 for altered apportionment and 2 for merger of tithe rentohargs, in addition to 5 for the enfranchisement of copyhold lands, have been received.Schedules of assessments of compulsory redemption money and expenses, together with the relative plans, were deposited in the parishes of Leftwich (Chester) and in Redbourne and Harpenden (Herts,) for inspection by all persons interest--       In each case the lands had become    divided into numerous separately-owned properties.     In the Redbourne and Harpenden oaaes, the applications for redemption were made by owners of parts of the lands, while in the Leftwich redemption the application was made by the titheowner. The Hearing of Objections to the schedule of assessments of redemption money and expenses in a case of compulsory redemption, affecting lands in Bexhill (Sussex) was fixed for the 17th inst. The number of property owners concerned was 102 of whom 4 lodged objections.     One of the objectors withdrew his objection and in the other 3 cases the Board determined adversely to the objections.The Board have made application to the County Court for the recovery of an assessment of redemption money and expenses on land in Hoddeston (Herts).     In addition to the usual notice of application under the TitheRentcharge Recovery Rules, 1891, it was necessary to serve a notice of application for leave to proceed under the Courts (Baergency Powers) Acts, 1914 to 1917.Valuations for the purposes of enfranchisement &quot;of copyholds have been approved in 3 oases, including one in which the valuation had been returned to the ^aluer for reconsideration and correction.Under the Inclosure and Commons Acts, any surplus rents arising from Recreation Grounds allotted under Section 73 of the Inclasure Act, 1345, may be applied to all or any of the following purposes and to no other:-(a)   improving the recreation grounds or any of them in thecame parish cr neighbourhood; fb)   maintaining the drainage and fencing thereof; (c;   hiring or purchasing additional land for recreation grounds in the sameparish or neighbourhood;U)
!(&amp;)   improving the f ield-gardens, or any fjf them, in the&apos; same parish or neighbourhood, or maintaining the drainageand fencing thereof; (e)   the redemption of any land tax, tithe rentoharge, or othercharge oh the recreation ground.In several oases in which reports have recently been received by the Board from the Parish Councils and other trustees of recreation grounds, it has been represented that there is no neoessity for the application of surplus rents -to ahy of the foregoing purposes and , requests have been made for authority to apply the surplus rents for purposes other than those above mentioned.    The Board have, of course, no power to give any such authorityj but in cennection with any legislation for the amendment of the InclaBure and Commons Acts it might perhaps be desirable tc consider whether the powers of the Board in this respect might not be made more elastic.Buildings and Equipment.Appointment of Architects.

The smaller deliveries this 3Eaqon are due to the fact that it was not possible at the commencement of the season to arrive at a final decision with regard to the price to be charged for the whole year and an agreement was accordingly made with the makers by which they undertook to deliver 40,000 tons for agricultural purposes on the understanding that they were allowed to export the surplus output during the first four months of the season; it will be seen that the quantity actually delivered was 48,000 tons. During the remainder of the season export will only be allowed of such quantities as it is felt can be spared after satisfying the home demand.Superpho sphate.&apos;
Superphosphate,       In response to the Boards request jfchat some-additional quantity &quot;of ooa] might he allowed to Prance with a Yiow to assisting the Phosphate Mines in North Africa, the Coal Controller has now consented to increase the allocation to Prance &quot;by 10,000 tone.     This is. sat lb factory and a communication on the subject is being sent to the Foreign Office in order that the French Authorities may be officially notified.Potash.   The British Potash Company whs are dealing with the German Potash acquired by the Government have now made an arrange-ment with the Fertiliser Ma:iufaoturers&apos; Association whereby that Acooelation will take over 24,000 tons of pntash and dispose of it at the prices which haio already been published.     A Notice will be issued urging faimers to buy potash as soon as the stocks in the country increase sufficiently to&apos;enable prompt delivery to be given.Lijme,,    In view of the rise in the cost cf coal and labour, it is proposed to increase the price of the ground limestone produced by the Beard&apos;s plant at Stoneycombe by 2/6d a ton, will raise the price to 15/- a ton in bulk,Marketing.A number of the County Fruit and Vegetable Societies whioh were established by the Food Production Department as a war measure in 1917 - 18 are developing satisfactorily, particularly those in Anglesey, Cambridge, &quot;Devon, Gloucester, Northampton^ Shropshire, Warwick and Vilte*     The Dorset and West Hants. Society which was experiencing great difficulties In regard to the cost of running its motor lorry has now reduced its outlay in this direction and it is understood that tho Auction Mart at Bournemouth maintained by this Society is doing a good business. The Societies in Cheshire, Somerset and North Wales are not yet very firmly established, but they promise to do well in time. The Societies in Berks., and Oxford on the other   hand do not appear to be able to secure sufficient produce for sale to enable them to pay their expenses.     The Worcestershire Society, which has now been established nearly three years, has installed a large plant for preserving at one of its depots.     The Society&apos;s Auction Mart at Worcester, which is open two days a week,, now has a turnover at each day-s sale of about  700.  , The Surrey and North Hants. Society has been closed down and the Societies in Buckingham and Essex are also preparing to wind up owing in both cases apparently to a lack of energy and ability on the part of the Committee, as there seems to bo a demand in both Counties for some such organisation,Seeds and Weeds Bill.The latest draft of the Seeds and Weeds Bill was considered in detail at a meeting held at this office ?,act week of the trade members of the Seeds Advisory Committees,     0::^y a few minor amendments were suggested and it is hoped thau the joint Conference to be held on the 24th inst , to discuss the final draft will show that the Bill has the unanimous approval of all the interests concernedcSale *if Farhinery and Implements,During the week ended October 17th returns of sales were forwarded from Gloucester, Nottingham, Pembroke, Somerset, Northants, Leicester, itiast and West Riding (Yorks.),Salop, Westmorland, Montgomery, Essex,     The returns show that the following have been disposed of:-

Up to date 812 sales have been held for which 796 returns have been submitted.Good prices are still being obtained.     During the week the following figures have been reached:-   Threshing Machine with trusser  349 .    Por-dson Traotor with plough  285. Farm lorry  46, Binder  45, Drill  36 and Disc Harrow  20.Sale cf Horses.$ ,        Two very successful sales were held at Reading on the llth-and Aylesford, Kent, on the 13th October.     At Reading the top price realised was  124 and at Aylesford  150.   Several other horses made over  100.i 33 Counties have new sold all their horses and of thereminder several have   only a few sick horses left which will be dis]6ose;d of as soon as possible.    The total amount realised for horses, sold is  502, 296.The sale of harness at Willesden on the 16th. sras again good, the prices obtained being well up t&quot;* the average.
II.IHT&quot;UjIG-EI&apos;TCE .Inspection,Tn-efb3J,owlng;.djaapeo-tions, etc, have been- recently mad,e:-Drills.     A trial with oats was made last spring with Dunn&apos;s drill, \w comparison with the Kassey Harris Disc drill.     In the case of the former seed and manure (superphosphate and sulphate of ammonia diluted.th chaff to facilitate sowing) were sown together;   with the latter Ithe manure was broadcasted.     The dry weather that followed was unfavourafcOe to the principle on which the Dunn drill works (sowing practically on the surface and covering up with cultivating tines).     The covering soil tried up and the plants came up unevenly.     The yields were practically Identical for the two machines,A second trial was held near Chelmsford on the 11th October in the same farm as before.     In this case a Massey Harris Disc and a Inyth drill were compared,     An attempt was made with the Dunn drill to lev,&apos; the manure with the seed, but this was unsuccessful.     The machine iconomises aiHsd and distributes it well in the row, but it is too heavy ad too complicated to be generally popular,though farmers with tractors till no doubt be prepared to give it a trial.     whether the principle of gurface cowing is .preferable remains to be seen.     It may have advantages for autumn sowing;    for spring work, it is probably risky.One lesson of these lor a drill which will do its If men and horses, and which,trials is that there is certainly need work quickly without too large a complement if possible, will drill artificials as wellFarms in Kent-   - On the 14th October three farms in Kent were lspectod.   Of these (l)   Wri net cad.. Court:-. (219 acres, of which arable )7-and pasture 111) &quot;as found^ so far as the bulk of the arable land was jmoerriod., to be practically derelict; the contributory causes being pbits, lack of skill and capital and shortage of horses and labour, fee gras3 land is relatively good, and could be used to groat advantage p sheep and store cattle.     It is suggested that failing a satisfactory [ranged en t with the landlord and incoming tenant the Committee should fee the farm over.     They should also take e^eps to suppress rabbits.Boy Court, Ulcombe (136 acres, of which arable 73.and grass 63). [ft of the arable is planted -ith hops, which have not been tended for k last year or two, and the land has become very foul.     Much of the 1st of the arable is very foul, but latterly with the help of a tractor [considerable amount of cleaning has been accomplished.    Much of the lass land is under fruit - apples and cherries, which though neglected [e, with the exception of one field of, about 6 acres, for the most part (pithy.     The meadows are starved and require dressing with olag.   The pittce are watching, the farm and the tenant seems inclined to meet. Icir wishes.     Possibly some more specific demand from the Committee would fcd to definite improvement.     (3) Cat of or d Farm..     This farm with two pors, Dingle Den and Benton Farms, in the parish of Bencndcn, hascrcd from neglect owing to delay in transference of ownership.     The &apos;C will probably be met by the Committee keeping all three holdings ^cr observation.I i gh t Hail way s , Es s ,cx .(l)   Onpar to Shcnfield.     This line running S.7. for 6 miles, would up Ongar with Bbcnficld - both on the G.S.K.

The principal oropa of the district are wheat, oats, clover, mangoHs, beans, potatoes and barley.     The graas land is about equal to the arable in extent and the principal steok is dairy cattle.    The soil, except in a few patches is not suitable fer market gardening, of whioh there is only a little in the district. There is nl doubt that a great deal might be done te improve the district beth in an agricultural and in a milk preduoing direction; but it is questionable whether the needs of the district could not be equally met by read transport with metcr-lerriea.An alternative route from Ongar to Chelmsferd is suggested*in a scheme prepared by a Committee of the Essex County Counoil.    This would tap a very similar district and have the advantage of connecting with a stepping place, and not merely a junction on the main line.(2) / Braintree and iforks !Tey.     The proposed railway would run due Last from Braintree, eh the WAtham Branch, to Marks Tey jn the main line of the G.J5.R., parallel to the main road.   Estimated cast  114,527.The district ia well cultivated, the western portion being chiefly devoted to corn and roets, while the seed-growing tf Coggeahall, abtut 6 miles east of Braintree, is well-known..    Prom Coggeshall eastward the land is farmed for corn and meat.     There is at present little dairying and better transport would do muoh to develtp this.    Market-gardening is net extensively practised in the district, being confined tc localities already served by railways.With present means if tr.aap.rt no farm %n the district is more than feur miles frtrn a statien.The Essex Reconstruction Ceramittee favoured a short line if SJ- miles, running Seuth frim Ceggeshail ti Kelvedon en the main G.E.R. line.    This sherter line&amp;, together with motor transport cn the main Braintree - Coggeahall * Marks Tey road, wexild prebably meet the needs ef the district fer seme time.Education.Higher Agricultural Education.Maintenance Grants.   Payment of instalments ef bleok grants te oertain agricultural Colleges in reapeot of the academic year 1918-19 have been made as a oonaequenoe of the receipt of Treasury approval which was referred to in last week&apos;a report.Harper Adams Agricultural College. An application has been considered from the Authoritiea or&quot; this College for a grant in aid of expenditure on propaaea alterations and extensions to the building.   The proposals involve (l) Renewal of and alterations to the heating, lighting and laundry, arrangements which are urgently required; (2) the convereiou of the existing dormitories into laboratories and the provision of hoetel aocommodation for 44 students and 3 members of the staff; and (3) the acquisition of 5 cottages adjoining the Institution.   The estimated cost of the whoTt scheme is  19,000.   The Board of Eduoation have been consulted as their consent will be required before the Governors can raise a loan.   A letter to the Treasury hao been put forward.County
County Agricultural Education.The Board of li&amp;uca-tion have invited the observations of the Board upon the proposal of the Lincolnshire (Holland) County Council that the Scheme under which the Kirton Grammar School is governed should be amended so as to make the existing Secondary School Buildings available for the purposes of a Farm Institute. The Board have expressed their general approval of the idea of an amended scheme being made and requested the Board of Education to refer the detailed particulars of the amended scheme submitted by the governors to them at a later stage.Agricultural Organisers.   The question of Agricultural Organisers acTlng &quot;also &quot;as&quot; Executive Officers has received further consideration, and a conference was held between Officers of the Intelligence Department and. the Land Department*   The decision arrived at was that the Intelligence Department should not for the present fix definite dates on which the &quot;dual capacity&quot; arrangement should cease.Proposed Farm Institute at Sealyham, Proposals to establish a Farm Institute aOfealyham &apos;haTe&apos;Tjeen&quot;received from the Pembrokeshire Ii.B*A-   The Chairman of the L,,I],-Ao called and produced plans of the property irhioh it i-s proposed ,to acquire for this purpose and explained the scheme generally.

It would appear that the interest now displayed in Milk Production in North Wales is greater than for a long time past and that one very noticeable effect of the work done during the last few years has been the decided increase in the cow population in many districts. ^Arable Dairy Farming pemonstrations.Cornwall - Rcsparvoth.

The Board have notified the Small HoldingsCommittee that they accept their offer to lease the site andarrangements have been made to take the site over. The Autumn sowing is now proceeding.Wilts.   Arrangements have been made to take over the site from the Small Holdings Committee and it was hoped to have had . possession and that the Autumn Crops would have been in by now but some difficulty has arisen with the sitting tenant which it is hoped to settle this week.Carmarthen.   What appears to be a suitable site has been found in South Wales and negotiations with a view to obtaining possession are now proceeding with the Carmarthenshire Small Holdings Committee.The general position with regard to these Holdings is, therefore, as follows:-   (l) The Board are in possession of 4 holdings, viz., Resparveth, Benham, Hucknall (Notts.) and Pytohley Lodge (Northampton);    (2) The arrangements are almost complete in respect of 3 other sites, viz., Durham, Warwick (Birmingham Town Council) and Wilts. (Devizes);   (3) A site has been found for the South Wales Demonstration at Whitland and the approval and co-operation of the Carmarthenshire Small Holdings Committee is awaited;   (4) Of the ten Centres which the Scheme contemplates four are definitely arranged and four are practically settled thus leaving two only to be provided, namely, one in North Wales and one in Hereford or Somerset,Training

Cultivation.     Surrey of Parm Orchards.   Montgomeryshire. Orcharas in the parish of Kerry included in^tvne survey have been found to be in a neglected condition.Worcestershire,     The survey of Farm Orchards in the Tenbury District was continued.     About 150 acres were surveyed in the Parish of Rochford, a district which is thickly planted with Orchards varying in age from 10 to 100 years, andin most cases attached to farm.     These Orchards contain a fairly large percentage of plums and damsons with some perry Pears, while 60^ of the apples are cider varieties, many of which possess no particular merit.     The general condition of these Orchardsis
is not good, and the farmers seem lacking in knowledge both in the oultural and the marketing sides of Fruit growing.-     The urgent need for instructional and.&apos; ad Tie cry work in apple growing is clearly indicated.      Advice given as opportunity occuired was well received, but   in the main farmers doing orchard work lack initiative and require information and advice to be brought to them on the spot-     Considerable quantities of high grade apples are reported as having been sold at  4 to  5 a ton while similar grade fruit in other areas has sold for as high as  30 a ton.III.   Training Centres.   Wiltshire.   The Amesbury Settlement has been visited with &quot;a view to ascertaining its suitability for horticultural training.   The greatest asset to the small holders will be the liberal supply of manure from military camps in the neighbourhood and these should also afford good markets for produce. A demonstration holding of 5 acres seems a necessity.lant Disease Section.Wart Dioease.   Reports of outbreaks of Wart Disease on allot-ments&quot;&quot;and ingardens are still numerous, but there were not quite so many as during thelast two or three weeks.   On the other hand cases of field infection are increasing and a number have been discovered in Denbigh and Cheshire.   In Shropshire a number of cases of allotment infection have been found in the South of the County, a district hitherto free.   Wiltshire is a County which has been thoroughly searched recently, but very few cases hare been discovered, the county as a whole remaining comparatively free. Great interest is manifested by allotment holders and others in this county in the outbreaks cf this disease, as the neighbouring county of Somerset is becoming badly infected.In the Liverpool district a farmer has been fined  6 for illegal planting of potatoes and another  5 for failing to report the presence of the disease on the susceptible potatoes that he planted.More cases are being reported from the West Riding and it is possible that this will have to beincluded in the new No. 1 Area.   On   the whole good crops of immune varieties are being lifted in the various infected areas.Other Potato Diseases.   Although potato lifting is now general very few blighted tubers are seen anywhere, and the crop is on the whole free from disease - except&apos; in the South West where a fair amount of disease has been observed in &quot;Edwards&quot;, &quot;Dates&quot;, and &quot;British Queens&quot;.. Corky Scab is again reported as being very prevalent in Derbyshire, and it is to be regretted that certain varieties&apos;which are immune to //art Disease, especially &quot;Lochar&quot; and &quot;Great Scot&quot; are very susceptible to this disease.   In some cases the crop has been rendered quite uselsss.Fruit
QFruit and Vegetable Diseases-     A conference has been held this week to^aXscuss&quot;*a&apos; draH^order dealing with &quot;Silver Leaf&quot;, and this Order is ready for consideration by the Advisory Committee. Its chief provision is that all the occupiers cf premises on which plum trees are growing must cut off and burn all dead wood cn plum trees before April 1st in each year.Very few specJments of other diseases have been received by the Board, but another case of Onion Smut is reported from the Tyne-side.Small LivestockJ?eo-tion,Pigs.     The Local Sanitary Authority have issued instructions to Messrs. Bentalls of Kingston-on-Thames to remove their pigs on grounds of public health.     This firm carried out the recemmendatien of the Board during the food crisis, and reared a large number of pigs.     As the result of an appeal by this Firm the Board are communicating with the Local Authority with a view to securing the withdrawal cf the disposal order,Poultry.     The-Board have completed the initial steps in connection with the Poultry Training Centre at the Titchfield Land Settlement.

Statistics.Tabulation of the returns of production of corn and hay is nov in progress, these returns being&apos;received during the second half of October.   The calculations of the ownership of fame according to the size of the holding also occupy a large number of the temporary staff,   The claims received under Part I of the Corn Production Aot now number 100,000.Market Prices.Partly owing to better transport facilities, there was a considerable increase iu the tracer of fat cattle and. sheep offered in the markets during the week ending 15th October, as compared with the previous week.   The quality of the cattle showed no improvement; very few were super-graded and at many markets a few were rejected for slaughter.   Pat sheep were generally not of very good quality and at some markets a number were also not accepted for slaughter. Supplies of pigs increased but were quite insufficient for require-ments.   Calves for slaughter were in great request, as much as . 17. 10s. being paid at York and ,315. 15s. at Northampton.   At several markets, all the calves wrere sold for slaughter.   In the store markets, only strong cattle in forward condition met with any demand, young beasts and thin wintering cattle being practically unsaleable except at very low prices.   At the annual weyhill sheep fair, the supply was smaller than usual but nearly all the best lots changed hands.   Small store pigs w^ere cheaper, the chief demand being for well-meated stores in forward condition.With the removal of control on the prices of vegetables, brussels sprouts, cauliflowers and onions sold at advanced rates, but prices cf other vegetables showed little change.   Apples con-tinued to advance in price.   Supplies of tomatoes were smaller and sold at higher prices.   Supplies of potatoes generally improved and prices were lower than in the previous week.Official certificates were issued for the export of 12 horses, 4 cattle, 82 sheep and 134 pigs to Prance;   1 horse, 27 cattle, 165 sheep and 25 pigs to Argentina;   5 cattle and 3 sheep to Uruguay.   Also 12 certificates for the export of forage to Jersey were issued.OrdnancemSurvey.During the week 14 sheets of the 25 inch map, 25 sheets of the 6 inch map and 2 sheets of the     inch map (new seriea) were issued.The following special maps and diagrams are in course.of preparation, or have been supplied to the Admiralty, V/ar Office, etc: -Sheet 11 S-.23.

1V.    ECONOMICS AND GENERAL,Labour and. Wages. IIDemobilisation.   The number pf men described^ as Agrricultuxlrts  demobilised during the seven days ended the 15th October was 3,976, making the total demobilised to that date 266,059.An Army Order has just been issued the effect of which is that all who joined the Colours under the Military Service Acts are now made eligible for demobilisation by certain fixed dates, except men who have volunteered for further service with the Armies of Occupation,   The Order will be communicated to Agricultural. Executive Committees in due^ course .&apos;Agrj.cuJ^ .&apos;,ue number of agricultural labourers,skilled or unskilled, registered at Employment Exchanges in England and Wales as available for employment on the land on the 10th October was 1.406 .Farm -Workers.   No further disputes have occurred in connection with agricultural labour.   The Returns for the report on agricultural employment have been sent out, and the replies are new being examined. A Committee on employment has been set up by the President.   The first meeting will be held on Friday, 24th inst.cultural yragea Board.Meetings of the Administration and Selection Committees were held on the 15th October at 11.0 a.m, and 6.30 p.m. respectively.The fortieth meeting of the Wages Board was held on Thursday the 16th October, Sir Ailwyn Fellowos presiding.Tho Chairman presented a Report from the Selection Committee, which was adopted by the Board, who ordered that the representative members recommended by tho Committee to fill vacancies on District Wages Committees should be appointed.The Board considered the objections received to their Proposal to vary the minimum rates of wages for all classes of male workers in Cheshire, together with a report from the District Wages Committee in the matter, and decided to make an Order giving effect to the terms of the proposal.   The Order, which will come into oneration on Monday the 27th October, provides for the payment of minimum rates of wages on the basis of a 54 hour week all the year round, the weekly rates in the case of workers of 21 years of age and over being:-   Head Stockmen, Head Teamsmen and Head Shepherds, 46s. 6d:   Second Stockmen, Second Teamsmen and Second Shepherds, 44s. 6d:   other workers 42s. 6d. with proportionately lower rates for workers under 21 years.Reports were considered from the District Wages Committees on a draft Proposal to provide that in the case of boys placed on the land by certain Institutions, the ordinary minimum rates of wages should be suspended during the first six months of the boys&apos; employment and in lieu thereof the boys be paid a specified amount of pocket-money in addition to the provision of board and lodging or its equivalent value in cash, and it was decided to issue the Pro-oosal.   Before an Order can be made giving effect to the terms of the Proposal a month must elapse from the date of the Notice, luring which period any objections may be lodged with the Board for their consideration.a recommendation was approved from the Leicester and Rutland District Wages Committee that the values at which provision of board and lodging for male workers in their area may be reckoned as
as part payment of minimum rates of wages should he increased to the level of the scale in force in adjacent counties, the effect of which is in the case of male workers of 17 years of age andover that, the value of an allowance of full board and lodging for a 7-day week is raised from 17s.6d, to 18s, per week with proportionate increases in the other items for such workers. .A report was adopted from the Administration  -Committee, dealing with the issue of Permits of Fxemption by District Wages Committees, the action taken to secure the enforcement of the Board&apos;s Orders since the last meeting of the Committee, and the results of proceedings in 13 cases of prosecution which had been undertaken since that meeting.Colonel Williams, of the Ministry of labour, attended at the close of the meeting for the purpose of explaining to the eiembers of the Board the provisions of the scheme for the employment of disabled ex-service men in agriculture.The next meeting of the Board will be held on Thursday the 27th November.Resignations of t&quot;.&quot;o in ectors have been accepted and one appointment has been made.On &apos; the 9th October an employer was summoned at Farnham, Hants, for the underpayment of two male workers and one female worker.     The case of one of the workers was dismissed as there was no evidence of underpayment in respect of the week for which the defendant was summoned.     The defendant was fined 10/- in respect of each of the other two workers, and ordered to pay arrears amounting to  3. 9. 0. and  2,19. 9. respectively.On the 15th October an employer was summoned at Dorking, Surrey, for underpayment of one worker.     The defence was raised that this man was old and not physically fit.     The Bench decided that, in their opinion, there was no intention on the part of the employer to pay the v,orker at less than he wa3 worth, but that at the same time a technical offence had been committed.     The defendant was fined 10/- and ordered to pay arrears amounting to  15. 7. 8. and costs.At Dronficld on 13th October, a case was heard against a farmer for underpayment of two workers.     One of the workers had been paid up to the larger portion of arrears then due to him on April 21st.     On April 30th, he met with an accident and had not since worked for the employer though still occupying a cottage rent free.     There was evidence of underpayment at the time of the first summons relating to this worker (for the week ending hiarch 29th) and that on or about April 5th he received a rise in wages v,hich with benefits brought it up to the minimum rate.     &quot;he other worker, a boy, was unable to give satisfactory evidence as to hi3 v.rages at the material periods.     Objection was taken on behalf of the Defendant to the use of Fang&apos;3 printers copies of the Orders for Derby, but the Bench decided to hear the case on its merits.All the summons^o were dismissed.At Fleetwood in Lancashire on 16th October, five summonses Were heard against a far or for underpayment of two workers.     In the case of one worker, a Permit was applied for immediately after the inspection of the farm, and granted ao from July 28th.     Theemployert
employer had paid both workers sums of money in respect of arrears du.i*, cm acme date after the proceedings had been commenced.    Both workers had been hired at a yearly rate amounting to loss than the minimum rate on 2/2/919,     It was argued for the defendant that he could not be called upon to make up the difference between the wage under the contract and the minimum rate until the termination of the contract.     The Bench found that an offence had been committed in the oa3e of both workers.     They fined the defendant  1 on one of the summonses in the case of each worker and costs on all the summonses and ordered him to pay arrears to the Permit worker.at the Permit rate as from 21/10/1918 amounting to  10.16.0, and to the other worker amounting to  1.10. 3.     The &apos;     .defendant was allowed to set off the summon he had already paid in respect of arrears.     These sums were  5. 6. 0. add  2. 9. 3. respectively.     In the latter case it was arranged that the worker should work off tho 19/- which he had been overpaid.During the week 88 oases of complaint of non-payment of the minimum rates were received, the highest number from a single county being 17 in the case of Yorkshire.     Cne hundred and seventy five cases were sent to the Inspectors for visit;    enquiries by correspondence were made in 144 cases and 125 cases were completed. Reports wore received from Inspectors in 134 cases.Women&apos;s Branch. By re-arranging a certain number cf field workers in the Land Army it should be possible to supply all the demands now coming in for the potato gangs.During the week it has been decided that ail surplus furniture- under the charge of tho Women&apos;s Sub-Committees shall be sent to the Base Depot for disposal in order that it &apos; - -.. may be allocated to various hostels which/are being opened for the training of disabled soldiers.Letters have been received from the Agricultural Executive Committees in Lindsey and Buckinghamshire expressing their satisfaction that it has been decided to continue the Wocien&apos;s organisation after demobilisation of the Land Army. The Secretary of the Lindscy A.E.C.. writes &quot;The Committee discussed the question of the women&apos;s organisation in this county, and I was instructed to inform the Board that they are strongly of opinion that tho organisation should be continued in the interests of food production&quot;.     This expression of opinion from Lindsey is all the more interesting as in the early days of the Land Army there was much objection to its organisation and widespread unwillingness to employ tire women on the part of ail concerned.Women&apos;b
Women]s^Ifletitutee. On October 18th the propaganda work in connect! cn&quot;wlth&apos;&quot;themorement was transferred from the Women&apos;s Branch cf the Board to the National Federation of Women&apos;s Institutes.When the care of that movement was entrusted by the President to the Women5a Branch in October, 1917, there were 130 Institutes already established in. the country.   The propaganda work undertaken by the Branch through the Women&apos;s County Committees and with the help of specially selected organisers appointed to the headquarters staff h.s been success-ful in greatly strengthening the movement and making it of real value in the rural 1; tflife cf the country.Requests to form Institutes have been carefully con-sidered, and they have been established only where a satisfactory Committee can be formed and the minimum number of members enrolled. Asa result of the propaganda work undertaken by the Branch 1,116 new Institutes have been established since October, 1917, making a total cf 1,246 at the present time,During the past week two large meetings of delegates to the National Federation have been held in London.   They were remarkable on account of the obvious interest taken by all who were present in the subjects brought forward.     A very large number of village women attended, and the orderly way in which the business was conducted and the ballot election of officers for the coming year carried through, was very marked.   At the election of the Xteecutive Committee for the coming year a village 7/oman from one of the counties was nominated as a member, and was elected by a large number of votes.In order to help the Federation to be less dependent upon public funds, a resolution was passed by the Annual Meeting to increase the affiliation fees from 2d. to 6d.Office accommodation has been found for the Federation in the same building as the office of the Village Clubs Association, and the staff which has been accommodated on the Board&apos;s premises for the last two years will shortly moire to their new quarters.An i ma,l Diseases.The number of outbreaks of Swine Fever confirmed has been 49, and the reports of suspected cases 206.Of Anthrax, 45 outbreaks have been confirmed, and 25 reports of suspected cases have been received.Two sutbreaks of Rajiies^ have been confirmed, both in Glamorgan, and 8 reports of&quot; suspected cases have been received.6 outbreaks of Ih9Jt-^aad^4(ouwth1 sease have been confirmed: one at Lawford Heath, near Rugby, one at Great Gransden, Hunts., two at Bournj 0amoridge, and two at ^orthwood, Isle of Wight, and in each case the usual restrictions have been imposed, pro-prohibiting movement over a wide area.Veterinaryr Laboratory.Sydne^Psver material was examined in 66 reported outbreaks. In 46 swine lever was found to exist.Anthrax material was examined in 7 reported outbreaks.   In 4 the disease was found to exist,Rabies

Post mortem examinations were made on 4 specimens&quot;/&quot;Rats, Orders^ 1913-1919 .The Rat Week Campaign, which has been well supported by the PreBS, started on the 20th inst.   Whilst as far as can be judged from the information received from various Districts, there is reasonable ground for hoping that a larger measure of success than was at first anticipated is likely to be achieved, it is to be feared that in many Counties the results will be patchy and in some little, or nothing, will be done.The Military Authorities have for some time past been taking active steps to organise measures for Rat Destruction, and as the result, many hundreds of rats have been killed at various camps, aerodromes and military establishments.   In every Command special efforts are to be made during Rat Week.Many Boroughs, notably Liverpool, have thrown themselves into the Campaign with vigour.   It is to be hoped that the steps taken by Liverpool will act as a stimulus to other Borough Authorities and encourage Manchester and other Boroughs to follow Liverpool&apos;s example.   The Health Authorities in Manchester compute the loss in their City from rats at  260,000 per annum.Rotherham County Borough and the Soke of Peterborough have appointed Rat Officers.?lax Production.Deseeding operations have commenced at nine of the factories,Output of ffibre and Tow.   The total amount of fibre prodced during the week was 106? cwts. or 1\ cwts, less than the output of the previous week.   The decrease is mainly due to illness of the scutchers and to breakdowns of machinery.   162^/8 cwts. of tow were also produced during the week, as against 156-j- cwts. in the preceding week, this being an increase of 50/3 cwts.Sugar Beet - Kelham Estate.Since the completion of harvest, the drilling and thresh-ing operations have been in progress, 368 qrs. wheat, 110 qrs winter oats, 30 qts. beans, 36   qrs. peas and 41 qrs. barley have been threshed to date.   The wheat so far has yielded remarkably well, averaging 5 qrs. to the acre: the winter oats are poor, barley has averaged 34 to 4 qrs., and blue peas 3 qrs. per acre. The reputation of the wheat crop is such that 225 qrs.   have been sold locally for seed at high prices.The position created by the scarcity of foodstuffs, together with the irregularity of the live-stock market have made it necessary to reconsider the policy of the live-stock section for the next six months.   To make the most of the present situation, the stock that required expensive treatment during the winter has been cleared, and heifers and cows that can be partly wintered out at little cost have been purchased.

The Committee anticipate that barrels will be presented for examination and purchase at the beginning of this week.Mention was made in last week&apos;8 report of the Order made by the Food Controller requiring every Cuier to have a licence.   Up to the present 136 licences have been issued, while 88 Curers have signed agreements with the Board to participate in the Government scheme.One or two difficulties were referred to in last weak&apos;a report.     The question of accommodation has been considerably al3.evi.ated by the action of the Air Ministry in placing a series of hutments at the disposal of the Curers for the housing of the fisher gills.     Secondly., the Ministry of Transport state that, while there are still difficulties regarding bhe conveyance of salt, on account of the fact that the only trucks specially designed for salt are the propeity of the Salt&apos; Union, they have nevertheless, managed to push through 52 trucks to their destination, and they will do all in their power to ensure for their early return for further consignments.Disposal of Admiralty Trawlers, and. Drifters..    During the past wck the questicm of the &quot;disposal of A*dm3.ra.&apos;!ty built trawlers and drifters has been occupying a great deal of time.     This matt,or has been discussed for the last six months or more, and var:ou3 schemes have been put forward, to which objection has been raised by one or other of the Departments interested,     It wab finally decided last week, however, to compromise with a view to introduce into one scheme the best points in all ithe schemes so far submitted.     The compromise was then submitted to the Chancellor, and as the result, the Cabinet have sanctioned the foilowing:-(1)   All drifters to be handed over to the two Fishery Boards, for disposal to fishermen, or groups of fishermen, on easy terms:   the number to be named to each Department to be settled departmentally,(2)   Trawlers to the number of 200 to be handed over to a Comparer formed of ex Service fishermen, who will be required to find the capital, as well as the cost of equipment and gear. No details &quot;nave yet been discussed as, at ths moment, the formal sanction of the Cabinet has not been promulgated;   when it i-s reoivi : vad. the first question to be dedldsd is the price at which the drifters and trawlers are to be handed over.   This pri.ee is to be settled in consultation with the Shipping Controller.

At the request of the National Sea ^isneries Protection Association, the Board took up the question of opening the Post Office at Lewesto ft at an earlier hour than usual, for the convenience of the fishing- trade during the herring Season. The Post Office have agreed to the 3oard*s suggestion, and it is understood that they open for telegrams at 7 a.m.Quarterly return of Sea Fisheries.
