Circulated to the War Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.SECRET.TEHsnx; &apos;     &apos; .&apos;&quot;:v. &apos;I N\Tmegram from Viceroy, Rome Department, dated 15th October 1919. ^/ (Received at India Office, 11.30 a.m., 17th.)^Turkish peace terms. Your telegram of 18th August. There has recently been considerable revival of feeling over Turkish peace terms, largely stimulated by pro-Turkish party in Europe. On the 18th September a meeting of about 10,000 Moslems was held in Bombay under auspices of Bombay Caliphate Committee, which appears to be preparing agitation. Procession carried black standard. Meeting itself would have been of formal nature but for remarkable speech by Gandhi, the only Hindu who spoke. He expressed disappointment at tone of meeting and reminded audience that future of Caliphate and Holy Places were questions of life and death to them. They had failed in their duty in not making their voices heard with clearness and strength, and had not realised that 21 crores of Hindus were ready to support them and thus enable them to dictate whatever terms they liked with every hope of success. They should not be content with mere intimation by reprisals that Government was doing all it could.What was wanted was that Viceroy should inform British Government that if Moslem demand was not met he could not carry on Indian administration. His final advice to meeting was to put heart and soul into agitation and adoption of satyagraha spirit. He followed up speech, by article in next issue of his paper urging Moslems to draw up minimum demands and present them as clear-cut issue. Gandhi&apos;s advice has not been lost on Moslem papers in Bombay, whose tone has undergone a change. Two papers have adopted his views en bloc, and rumour is current in Bombay that Moslems intend closing down business and declaring Hartal on 17th October, day fixed by recent session of All-India Moslem League at Lucknow as day of prayer in connection with Caliphate question. In other provinces there are also indications of revival of agitation. Meetings have been held, and Moslem papers are exercised over the dismemberment of Thrace and secrecy of peace terms. Hindu papers in the United Provinces, particularly (?of the) extremist type, have expressed sympathy with this attitude. The All-India Moslem League&apos;s meeting at Lucknow, 29th December (? September) was well attended, but (? effect) was (? marred) by disputes as to who should preside. Main resolution declared that spiritual position of Sultan as Khalifa indissolubiy bound up with his temporal power, and that creation of small States with non-Moslem powers as mandatories was intolerable interference with Khalifa. In Madras a meeting convened by local Moslems on 5th September was signalised by hoisting of Turkish flag and prayer for victory of (? gracious) Sultan and preservation-tion of Holy Places. At recent Trichinopoly Congress extremist Hindus proposed resolutions on Khalifat and Ali brothers.Burma, Delhi, and Assam also (&apos;? report) increased (? unrest) over Turkish question. Though it is doubtful whether masses are yet genuinely stirred and uncertain how far Moslems relish Hindu intervention, prolonged tension is having undesirable effect, and we (? can only) urge expediency of early (? settlement).121-2 60  10.19
