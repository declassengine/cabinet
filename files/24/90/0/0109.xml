In view of the near approach of tho time when, through weather conditions, our forces will be obliged to evacuate the Gulf of Finland, the Admiralty are anxious to obtain from the Cabinet a decision as to the line of action to be adopted in tho Baltic during the winter months.Tho Cabinet will be aware of the strain that has been put upon the Navy by the operations in those waters; and it is neediesq to point out that the withdrawal of our Naval forces would not only considerably lessen the Admiralty&apos;s difficulties, but save vast sums of money.Although no arbitrary data can bo fixed as to when tho ice- conditions will make it impossible for our ships to remain in tho Gulf of Finland &quot;without&apos; being frozen in. it may be assumed that this will bo any time after the 12th November.The object of our foreas in the Gulf of Finland has boon to guard our friends from attack by sea by the Bolsheviks, and this has so far boon achieved,N-    It was hoped that tho pourparlers between tho Baltic States and the Bolsheviks which were to have begun on the 29th September would have cleared tho political horizon, but owing to recent events wo ire at present no nearer any conclusion than wo v/ere.   It is not likely, therefore, that any decision as to the withdrawal of our forces can be arrived at on this basis,Although climatic reasons will enforce tho withdrawal of our ships from tho Gulf of Finland, it will not bo necessary on those grounds to withdraw thorn from the Baltic - though such ; procedure is most desirable.  Tho climatic reasons which will drive our ships out of the Gulf of Finland will probably,- but...? -not with certainty, prevent the Bolsheviks from taking that action which, up to tho present, we have prevented; for although thoy might, with tho use of icebreakers, break through tho ice if wo have nothing there to prevent them, it is improbable that they will have either tho energy or the morale to do so.  Riga will be closed by ice but Libau may be considered an ice-free portIt is therefore for consideration whether, on some date &apos; after the 12th November, the whole of our forces should be with-  &apos; drawn from the Baltic, or whether a section of them should remain at Coperihagen for the winter ^This latter step would entail the maintenance of this force, whatever its size, at a considerable distance from its base, and the expenditure of a large sum of money.Unless, therefore, any objection is raised, tho Admiralty propose to instruct the Senior Naval Officer, Baltic, to withdraw the whole of his forces and return to England when forced by climatic reasons to evacuate tho Gulf of Pinland.If this stop is approved., the situation of the various military missions at Eelsingfors, Libau, Reval, etc., would need to be reviewed.Forwarded,(Intd.)
