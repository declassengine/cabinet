enimesrLwmammmmmm /IfThe Rates Advisory Committeeto be set tip under-Section 21 of the Ministry of Transport Act, will shortly bo appointed.Committee, the amount of additional revenue which It is submitted of the results of Railway Working for tho financialTho inorcaso in working expenses (War Wage, Eight hour day and other concessions, extra cost of coal and other material,) was put at about  100,000,000.The amount guaranteed to the Railway Companies under the Railway Agreement, based on their net receipts for 1913, is  47,400,000.The cost to the Exchequer is the amount of tho difference between the working&apos;expenses plus the guaranteed net receipts and the revenue earned by tho Undertakings.It was estimated that, when allowance had been mado for these factors, the sum to be made good out of the Exchequer would bo  60,000,000 in all-.The annexed statement &quot;A&quot; shows the approximate-results of Railway working for the first five months of the current financial year.The total net&apos; revenue for the five months Iti  11,603,000.     It will be seen that the passenger traffic continues to be high.Statement &quot;B&quot; shoW3 the estimated position for the whole financial year,- based on the five months&apos; experience and after allowance has boon made for certain known factors-, such as the increasing expenditure on wages and -coal,-whichIt will bo necessary to Indicate at once to the desired to raise.In the debates on the Bill, various estimates wereyear ending March 1920, as, compared with 1913.

I recommend, therefore, that the Rates Advisory Committee;.should be asked to advise at the earliest possible-moment as to the best means of obtaining not less than  45,000,000 per annum from freight receipts, and in what way the burden can be most fairly distributed over the various goods traffic * .  The new tariff should take effect not later than the 1st of January 1920.The object aimed at is to relieve the Exchequer of any call in connexion with the working of existing undertakings *   It is not possible to say with certainty whether an addition of  45,000,000 to freight receipts would suffice to restore financial equilibrium in 1920/1921, but it must be borne in mind that this result could, in the most favourable circumstances, only be achieved if Passenger Revenue next year maintains the abnormally high level readied during the current year.-,     This is. by no mer/as
certain,, even if the present f^r.s. are retained, as probably travel has been unduly indulged in this year from a variety of causes.On present information,- however^; it must bo pointed out that the proposed increase in railway rates will not bo sufficient to gquate tho increased freight charges asked for by the Coastal.Shipping Linos, and unless the Coastal Shipowners arc able to reduce freights, to compete with tho new railway rates, which will be on an economic basis, the traffic will either all be thrown on rail, or the Government will have to&apos; continue the subsidy on a reduced scale.I.am.discussing&quot;this matter with&apos;the Shipping Controller, but even if &apos;he is of the opinion that freights will /not; fall, I do not think it would he justifiable to place railway rates, on more than;an economic basis, merely. ...in order ,to divert traffic to. coastal shipping, which held .i.ts own against Railways before the Ivaiy-----, For the moment. I do not recommend any reductions or concessions in passenger fares,&apos; but I am giving this Question further, consideration.,.,especially with a view to the relief of the commer^&amp;j,..and .business . classes who travel habitually on season tickets.;.  The colleagues will, however, remember in this connection thai in the recent statement to the . Press in connection, with the...N...U.R.: negotiations as to standardisation., . the. possibility of. a. 5.0$ instead of the present I2ys% increase on season tickets was indicated..    The question o.f revising Workmen&apos;s fares, mayr have..to. be raised.     They are still, on. a pre-war basis, and are probably now involving considerable loss...    The increase, in ordinary fares led to large increases in the; numbers, travelling at-workmen^ fares, and as tin tickets are only available at certain hours, it is. probable that, to certain classes, the.working, day has been-.unduly extended, as they travel considerable time.before they can commence work.
