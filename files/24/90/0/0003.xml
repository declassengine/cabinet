Treasury have authorised the Department to discontinue   as far as practicable the checkings of declarations In respect of areas of cereal crops produced in 1919 as returned by growers.   Revised instructions, havo, therefore^ been issued to the Inspectors. This decision as to tho chocking of:claims will, it is anticipated, materially hasten the oompletlan of tho crop survey work.PROGRESS .QF, FARM WOftS.The woather was somewhat broken during the week, but not so much KKxfc: so as to retard harvesting operations to any appreciable extent.Throshing is new woll advanced in Southern and midland counties, while in northorn counties, owing to tho later season,and t$ diffornt $KSEfci farm practice * the bulk of the grain crop is still unthreshod.   Good yields of barlojr and wheat are reported.   Oats, though bottor than was expootod a few months ago, is scarcely an avorage crop, tho grain in many cases being rather small anu light.Roports regarding the potato crpp go to show that the yield, will be well undor that of last year, largely owing to tho presence of a high proportion of underslzod tubors.   Turnips and mangels are bulbing&apos; woll as a result of recent rains, and fair yields of both crops mf bo oxpooted.8/10)19.DEPARTMENT OP AGRICULTURE All!)

i; -    ftTho rodent railway strike re-.aet3ed imfavtyurably on the prices of farm produce, and was al30 the cause of a shortage of coal supplied for threshing.F L A X.a very -emallT proportion of &quot;&quot;the 1.919 crop &quot;Is &quot;being soutched at present.   Farmers aro in no hurry to send their flax for scutching pending the outcomo of the agitation for an increase in tho pricos fixed for tho 1919 crop.     Tho protracted harvest is also responsible, to a certain oxtent, for the delay in tho commencement of scutching operations.The Department havo distributed upwards of 40,000 copies of a leaflet explaining   the liability of scutchraill owners in connection with the purchase of tow and giving information as to the returns obtained by farmers who, last season, retained their tow, and paid the fixed scutching charges.   The loaflot also gived reasons why millowners should accept generally the practice of scutching tow as it is produced instead of holding it over till the end of the season when the flax has all been soutched.Arrangements had beon made to hold examinations for flax apprenticeships during tho week,   Owing, however, to tho inconvenience due to the restriction o$ thain services consequent en the railway strike in Great Britain, the Department postponed the examinations.The department have recommended tho Government to introduce permanent legislation requiring the lioensing of scutchmills in Ireland.   It is proposed that tho legislation, if enacted, should be administered by the Department,   The object is to ensure the economio scutching of flax with a view to increasing the yield of fibre and improving its quality.   Authority is also being sought in the Bill to make regulations regarding the disposal of tew, so as to remove the grievanoeo of flaxgrowers in regard to this matter, and so encourage them in the cultivation of the crop.FOOD CONTROL   SECTION.The reduotion in tho quantity of the sugar ration to householders, caterers and institutions, necessitated by the recent striko, still obtains and is likely to continue for some weeks.A &quot;Cake and Pastry Order&quot; has been passed forbidding the manufacture of light and fancy pastries and certain forms of cakes and biscuits.
