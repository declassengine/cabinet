s......V,This document is the property oi His Britannic Majesty;s Government.WAR CABINET.REPORT ON A VISIT TO SOUTH RUSSIA, BY MAJOR H. S.SAYER.CIRCULATED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR war.1. During a tour of South Russia in connection with the use of tanks in that theatre, from which I have just returned, I came into direct contact with evidence of wholesale massacres by the Bolshevik authorities.2. At Kiev, which I reached a few days after its capture by Denikin&apos;s forces, I visited one of the Cherezvichayka houses, of which there were at that time five known to exist in the city. Here I found 27 male bodies laid out for identification by relatives, whilst in a pit in the garden of the premises, from which these bodies had been taken, there remained a further large number of bodies.It is impossible for me to express a definite opinion as to whether any torture had taken placa bsfore the victims were killed, since the remains were in a somewhat advanced state of decomposition. It is, however, probable that these prisoners escaped actual torture, since they were a batch, I was told, which was killed out of hand just prior to the Bolsheviks&apos; evacuation of the city. In almost every case the heads had been smashed, apparently by a blunt weapon. I was informed that all these victims were &quot; Bourgeoisie &quot; and members of the Russian nobility.3. The actual killing took place in a garage, slightly detached from the main building, and the walls and concrete floor of this garage can only be described as a shambles.4. I next visited one of the Commissaire headquarters where prisoners were said to be examined and sentenced.The hcuse itself, which had previously belonged to a former Governor of Kiev, was gutted as completely as possible without being actually burned down; all the fittings and furniture were destroyed and a great litter of broken bottles, paper and refuse prevailed.A certain amount of indiscriminate killing was said to have taken place in the grounds of this house, but, generally speaking, the prisoners were merely sentenced here and afterwards marched, often in a nude state, to one or other of the Cherezvichayka for execution.The less fortunate prisoners were confined in large batches in two cellars, without light or furniture of any kind, in the basement of the premises. They remained here in some cases for several weeks, and were apparently not permitted to leave the cells for any purpose whatever.Judging from the condition of the place, I should consider this statement to be true.5. The following day I paid a visit to the Lukianovskay prison, in which were large numbers of Bolsheviks, captured with tb.3 taking of the city. My arrival was unannounced to the prison authorities, but I was immediately taken round on a tour of inspection, and was particularly struck by the considerate treatment accorded to the prisoners, who were quartered in clean and reasonably comfortable cells and were apparently receiving proper attention in every respect.6. During a subsequent interview with General Bredof, the Governor, General Usefovitch, commanding the troops in the area, and the Mayor of the City, these officials volunteered the information that a certain amount of killing of Jews was taking place which they were powerless to completely prevent, since it was carried out solely by individuals inspired by hatred and a desire for retribution. I had previously been unaware of this phase of the struggle and had put no questions to encourage the authorities to express their views. Their general bearing, however, left no doubts in my mind as to the absolute sincerity of their efforts to check the evil, and I am certain that in Kiev there existed nothing in the nature of a Pogrom.7. Throughout my tour I received abundant evidence of the genuine appreciation, not only by the military but by the more solid Russian citizens of the large towns, of the assistance which the British Government has provided in South Russia.(B19/471)  70  10/19  H&amp;S   7594wo&apos;,
At Poltava, where my train halted for a few hours, I had been expected, and was entertained to luncheon by the civil Governor, the Mayor and the leading townspeople, and was asked to convey their thanks to my Government.Similar hospitality was accorded to me at Kharkov by General Maimaiovski, in command of the troops on the Kiev Kharkov front.At Kiev the feelings of the people were very apparent and some begged to be allowed to salute &quot;Kussia&apos;s only Ally&quot; through her representative.During my stay in this place General Maimaiovski carried out a review of the troops engaged, on the front. The ceremony took place in the main square of Kiev and included an impressive religious thanksgiving service.I was asked to join the General during this review, and at the conclusion of a speech, in which he acknowledged Kussias debt to this country, massed bands played our National Anthem, whilst the crowd, military and civil, responded with great feeling.Similar enthusiasm prevailed in the evening at a dinner given by the town to the military, when our anthem was again played.The War Office,17th October, 1919.
