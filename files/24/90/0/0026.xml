(This document is the property of Hie Britannic Majesty1s Government).WAR___CAB 11 Et &apos; .RgTAIL   BUSIES   (LICENSING)   ORDER.(Memorandum by the Minister of Labour)SECRET.The Retail Business (Licensing) Order was made on IBth February , 1913, by the Minister of National Service. It requires any person! who opens a new retail business or a branch of an existing retail business to obtain a license under the Order before doing so.. The administration of the Order was transferred from the Ministry of National service to the Ministry of Labour on 17th March, 1919.The Order was made in order to protect the interests of serving or recently demobilised sailors and soldiers who, before their enlistment, were the owners of businesses which might be injured by fresh competition.   Thus a license is issued unless it appears that the opening of the shop in question would injure the interests of a serving or recently demobilised man*It had previously been proposed to continue the Order till six months after the end of the war but the question now arises whether it ought not to be revoked at once.At the present time about, 2,800 applications for licenses are received each week and of these about 8*5 per cent are refused. The staff employed tn the administration of the Order numbers nearly 200 and the cost is about  40,000 a year.This cost is large in relation to the results achieved and the $rder is open to the further objection that Its operation must hamper the development of retail trade.   On the other hand it may be urged that the Order is necessary for the protection of the Interests of the men who are still with the Forces.On the whole, I have come to the conclusion that,both for the sake of economy and in order to remove hampering restrictions froi^ the development of retail trading, it is necessary to revoke the Order forthwith.   I have included this item with others in ray general report on retrenchment, but as a question of policy of some importance is involved, I am also submitting it separately to the Cabinet for their consideration and early decision.(Signed)   R.S.Horne.15th October, 1919.&amp;      JI.A.C- k fV)
