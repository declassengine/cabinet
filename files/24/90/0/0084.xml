Memorandum by the Attorney-General. (Refeyertoe, O.T.8521 and H.A.C.42)1, On October 15th the Committee of Home Affairs, inview of the strong opposition shown towards the 7ar Emergency Laws (Continuance) Bill when it was introduced, into Parliament in July last, and in view also of the necessity of passing, this Bill into law at as early a date as possible, decided to apooint a small Committee who should examine the Bill carefully In order to delete therefrom &quot;11 those statutes and regulations the continuance of which Is no longer cons? &quot;&quot;ered essential,2. A meeting of his Cormiittee was holt- on lorn&quot;1 ay,October 2D&amp;fc, at 5 p.m. in the Attorney General&apos;s room at the Law Courts, when the following were present:-The Attorney General (in the Chair),The Solicitor General,Sir F.F. BiMell, K.C.B.,Sir E. Troup,,K.C.B., K.C.V.O., Home Office,Mr. H.A., Payne, C..E., Board of Trade,Mr. J.A. Corcoran, C,B. \7ar Office,Mr * ;7, J. Evans, C. B-.S., Admiralty,Mr. G.H. Allen, Ministry of Pood,There were also in attendance:-Mrft G.H. Drury, iJar Office, Mr. Hobson, Board of.Trade, Mr* G.M. Evans, Assistant Secretary, V&apos;ar Cab,inet.5. Reports had. been received from most of the Departmentsconcerned,, and after careful examination of these r^norts and of the Bill it was agreed that a very lar^e niuuber of the statutes and regulations izhose continuance is provided for in the Schedules to the Bill can now be disnensed with. These regulations and statutes are shewn - in. the Appendix.
4. In addition to those statutes and --emulations whichcan be immediately dispensed with, there are certain other regulations &quot;hich need only be retained in part, such as Regulation 2B, which need only be retained in respect of articles of food and of flax, and others which are needed only until the passage of certain Acts   for example the Aliens Restrictions Act, 1914, is only needed until theyAliens Restrictions Bill at present before Parliament becomes law.5. It appears, therefore, that such a large proportionof the Bill may now be jettisoned, that the Government can safely proceed to a Second Reading of the measure; ancij having at that stage announced the provisions which &apos; it is proposed to delete, the few remaining provisions which are likely to prove controversial can be fought out in Standing Committee-,(Signed) GORDON HEWART.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W\l* 21st October,1919.
