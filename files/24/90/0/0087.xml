My dear Lloyd George,

One characteristic of this country is its power of rising to an occasion and being swept as a whole by a great wave of idealism. This happened in the War. From considerable reluctance to enter ? the war the whole people passed to enthusiasm which made every individual voluntarily restrict his ?umption of food and fuel with even greater stringency than our compulsory rationing. This capacity for idealism has great advantages for the world; it also has some dangers. It may be followed by temporary reaction to hard materialism, or the country may be swept by a wave of idealism which arises from ignorance or misunderstanding.

This is our danger in the Irish question. A great mass of Americans realise nothing of what we have been doing for Ireland in the last 30 years; they are fed and excited by lies or exaggerations springing from the heated imaginations of hostile Irish, and they might suddenly take up the Irish question as a crusade.

This is why it is so urgent that the British Government should announce some policy of self-government for Ireland which Americans cannot ignore. But it must be a big policy t?at carries conviction of our mention to give effect to it. So Little has come of Irish policy hitherto that there is an impression that what British Governments say is not sarl usly meant. There is no certainty, but there is reason to hope that such a policy might greatly amerliorate American and even some Irish feeling here.

An Irishman in a high position of influence amongst Irish here sent this message to the two days ago:

"Tell the Ambassador to let us have a policy which will enable us to resist the ?old men in our party. At the same time tell him that I realise the difficulties of the Irish situation."

This message is the most interesting as I am assured that the person who sent it had hitherto been regarded as having gone/to over Sinn Fein.

I am of course explaining the Irish question in private conversation, pointing out that during the last 30 years we have turned the Irish from over-rente?tenants into prosporous peasant proprietors by the use of British credit, and that both financially and politically, as exemplified by Irish grants from the common fund, by compa?tively light taxation and by over  
rather than under representation in the House of Commons, we have been offering Ireland a partnership on terms rather more favourable than those enjoyed by England, Scotland, or Wales in the Imperial Parliaments   The Irish trouble is therefore not In. the unfairness of the Unionist offer to Ireland but in&apos;the fact that Unionism has ma0.e the mistake of insisting on offering Nationalist Ireland something that Nationalist Ireland, does not want.   Unionists, for instance &quot;The Times&quot; and Lord Robert Cecil, have recognised this mistake.   Home Rulers, on the other hand, have made the mistake of not recognising that the Protestant area of Ulster cannot be coerce&apos;1, and must have separate treatment till they voluntarily unite in some form of Irish self-government,   I have^ said, that both Unionists and Home Rulers are now prepared bo make a new start and that as soon as the Government has breathing space from Paris Conferences and Labour troubles it will formulate a new oolicy. It is most urgent that this should be done.Yours sincerely,GREY of F.
