MILITARY.OCCijy ^IOH CP ^TURKISH r IHSTOIJS. Copy of latter from tho Prlmo Iiini3tor to H,H,tho flmir Fiisol.10, Dooming Street, vhitoholl, S.&quot;.l.10th October, 1919.Your Highness,I bog to aclmo^le^go receipt of your letter of the 9th October in which you suggest that tho proposals for tho oeou-pation of Syria after the British withdrawal should be oanoellod or at least suspended, and that the whole question should-he plaobd before the. Peaoe Conferonoo or before a sub-Conference appointed by it for final settlement without delay.I do not think it is necessary for mo to discuss again the reasons which have prompted His Majesty^ Government in putting forward the proposals -contained in the aide-memoire as these have been fully set forth in the letter already communicate-&apos;1 to you by the Foreign Seoretary.    For tho reasons therein set forth it does not seem to me, that tho proposal you now make is practicable. His Majesty18 Government have made up their mind that it is impossible for them to continue the occupation of Syria-by British troops-.    Six months ago they announced to the Poaoe Conforenoo and to yourself that undor no -circumstances would they aooopt a mandate for Syria.   Their occupation of the country, which involves thorn in a heavy burden of expense, has boon prolonged far beyond their own expectation in the hopes that tho issues -Confercnoo would deal with the question without&apos; delay.     There is now no prospect of the Peace Conference being able to undertake the discussion&apos; of the Turkish problem for some months, and tho regrettable illness of President kilson, without whose participation no final decisions can be arrived at, is likely to delay rather than to hasten tho settlement of the prohloEU,    It is, therefore, impossible for His Majesty&apos;a Government to withdraw the proposals which they have
mado for/ dealing with tho Syrian problem in the interim period until the Peace Confer once, oan settle it..Tboy wonl^, however^bo vary glad to arrange an. i-nmediato mooting &quot;botwoon-yourselfa Trench, an ..&apos;raorican. an:d-.a British, representative to adjust.in a most amicable and satisfactory manner to all conoeraed, the problems involved in the impending withdrawal of British troops from Syria on November 1st.,,As already announced I am looking forward to hearing Your Highness&apos;s remarks in person at a further interview on this question.on Monday next at four. orclook at 10, Downing Street.I have the honour to beYour Highnossf most obedient Servant, (Signed). D.LLOYD GEORGE.,,Highness Sherif Faisal.
