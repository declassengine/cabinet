(&amp;)&apos; Not Involving a Stoppage of Work.Part I.-General.The Coming Labour Problem.Part I of last week&apos;s Report dealt with the situation resulting from the railway strike. There would seem, however, to be some urgency for reviewing the present industrial situation from a wider standpoint, and the following remarks are accordingly directed to this end.The railway dispute has been settled on the basis that wages are to remain at least at their present level until the 30th September, 1920. A provisional settlement of the ironmoulders&apos; strike has been suggested upon similar terms. The Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act has been extended once already, and discussion as to its further extension is at present going forward. The Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congress have appointed a special Committee to go into the question of the temporary stabilisation of wages and the consolidation of war wages, and it is expected that as a result a general demand will be made for the stabilisation of existing war wages until the 30th September, 1920 (see Pait IV).  In view of these facts, it may probably be concluded that it will(C1901) 255  10/19  H &amp; S 2 Y
not be found possible to reduce wage levels, or even to prevent them rising still further, before the end of 1920. The question, therefore, emerges what the situation is likely&apos; to be at that date.At first sight this looks like a problem for the future, but a little consideration reveals it in an entirely different light. Any provisional arrangement with regard to wages might be supposed to be based on two assumptions: (1) that it disposes of the problem at any rate temporarily; (2) that the problem will be at least as easy to deal with-in a year&apos;s time as it is now. Now there would appear to be strong grounds for believing that the second of these assumptions is unwarranted and that the problem will become increasingly difficult of solution in the near future, and may conceivably be quite insoluble in a year&apos;s time. The position at present is not what it was a year ago. The year&apos;s delay, though no doubt inevitable, has not been found to make things much easier. It is true of course that, so far as this country is concerned at any rate, the situation may appear somewhat more stable than it was ; but it can hardly be treated as a basis for the organisation of peace industry, and in the meantime the temper of the contending parties has become more exacerbated.The main ground, however, for this conclusion is not seen until a wider view is taken than that which is confined to the United Kingdom. The truth is that the situation We have to face is merely part of a general situation prevailing over the whole industrial World. The problems which we are hoping to solve later are governed by circumstances in the world at large which are becoming Worse, and not better. The World in fact badly needs the food, clothing and transport which have been forthcoming, one way or another, in the past, and on which therefore the world has come completely to depend for its life. It needs greater production. But the productivity of many countries is less than it was even a year ago. It is true that men have returned from the armies in large numbers and that the large scale production of munitions has ceased. But there seems good ground for believing that Central Europe and Russia may be lapsing into famine, disease, and disorder greater than has yet been seen, while in the more fortunate areas the claim by the lowest paid workers for a higher standard of, life is making increased demands upon the world&apos;s supplies. A year ago in many countries there was hope. Now in many quarters despair appears to be setting in, and germany, Austria and Hungary are reliably reported to be falling into apathy or worse. In Erance and Italy, meantime, elections are being held amid a confusion of labour policies. Expenditure by Governments is everywhere in excess of income. The inevitable result of such a state of affairs will be to raise the level of prices everywhere and to produce psychological reactions which, lead in the direction of dis-content and strikes and to erratic transformations in the policy and practice of govern-ment.Prom these considerations it becomes clear that the end of 1920 must not be looked upon as a date at which it will be possible finally to solve the wage problem and all the others that follow in its Wake. The postponement of the final solution of the problem until then does not therefore render any less urgent the need for grappling with the situation that gives rise to it, and accordingly to this situation we now have to turn.If the wage element in the cost of production continues to increase, the cost of commodities, other things being equal, must increase correspondingly. Further, it is to be remembered that in all recent movements of wages large classes of the community have been left behind. Many professional and salaried workers are having to cut their coat out of half their pre-war cloth, and the same is true of many kinds of ill-organised manual Workers. If the professional and salaried classes begin to insist on an adjustment of their, fees and salaries, and if action is taken as there seems every probability that it will be taken on behalf of ill-organised manual workers, the result will be a further rise in the level of prices. It is true that there are factors operating in the other direction, as for example the possibility of effecting economies by increased efficiency and the elimination of waste. The return of six million workpeople from the Forces and from munition employment to civil industry must in the long run result in an increase in the volume of commodities and services placed upon the market. But these influences may probably be over-Weighed by the increased spending power due to payment of interest on State loans and by savings being lent to the State instead of invested in productive enterprise, and, further, by the use of bonds as collateral for the purpose of borrowing money at the bank. In addition there would appear to have come into existence a class that is spending its gains or the interest on them in unwarrantably luxurious ways. This kind of expendi-ture will inevitably draw workers away from the production of necessaries to that of goods and services of no general utility and drive the price of necessaries still higher.The country as a whole is poorer in accumulated stocks and in instruments and powers of production than in 1914.   There is less to work with ; there will be less to go round :
some individuals or classes must go short of their 1914 ration. On the other hand, organised labour is demanding and securing for certain sections a level of subsistence higher than than of 1914. A very large sum has annually to be paid in interest on the National Debt. That interest is different from commercial interest in that the capital on which it has to be paid is not actual capital in the service of industry. Meanwhile, as is always the case in time of rising prices, large profits are being made. Two of these three sections the favoured grades of organised labour, and the &quot; profiteers &quot; are drawing increased amounts out of the diminished stream of supplies. Unless the volume of output can be increased the other classes will among them have to put up with a greatly reduced share of the diminished national output. But the holders of fixed-interest stock (war loan and in-dustrial) have a guaranteed return which only rising prices can diminish. The rest cannot conceivably cut down their calls on the national dividend to such an extent as to make supplies go round. Therefore prices will rise, and, until such time as countervailing factors are strengthened, will go on rising until the tension becomes too great and the situation explodes.The best we can hope and work for is to regard the present level of prices and wages as a new permanent standard, and endeavour to create a new economic equilibrium round about the 1919 scale. This is the best because every further circuit up the vicious spiral brings unsettlement in its train, and equally because the return journey down the vicious spiral to the level of 1914 is even more full of peril. What we need now more than anything is a sense of fixity. The attempt to link wages to the cost of living is unwise in that workmen will not be induced to produce more by being told that if they produce more prices will fall and wages will follow suit. If this point of view can be adopted, action which it requires would not appear to be impossible of achievement, but it involves a wider field than that covered by the Ministry of Labour.Part II. Departmental.Progress in the Development of Trade Boards.Since the passing of the Trade Boards Act, 1918, progress in the establishment of Trade Boards for ill-organised and poorly paid industries has been accelerated, and the action taken under the Acts has doubtless contributed effectively, if unobtrusively, to minimise the difficulties of the period of resettlement, and especially those implied in the rapid return to women&apos;s industries of large numbers of women and girls engaged during the war upon munition work. The rapidity of this development has been made possible by the provisions of the amending Act, which rendered much less cumbrous and prolonged the process necessary for the constitution of a Trade Board. Under the Act of .1909, no new trade could be brought under the provisions of the Act except by Provisional Order. A confirming Bill was therefore necessary, which made considerable demands upon the already over-burdened time of Parliament, and was liable to obstruction at every stage of the legislative process. Procedure by Special Order under the Act of 191.8, removes this necessity for confirmatory legislation, although the control of Parliament is maintained by the fact that a Special Order may be annulled in pursuance of an address presented to either House. The further difficulty, implicit in the fact that the Act of 1909 could be applied only to trades in which wages were exceptionally low as compared with those in other occupations, has been removed by the Act of 1918 which can be applied in any trade where there is no adequate machinery for&quot; regulating wages and where wages are very low. This avoids the obvious difficulty that wages, as has often been the case among women workers, may range consistently on a very low level, without its being. possible to pick out any one class as exceptionally ill-paid. Thus the process of estab-lishing a Trade Board has been greatly facilitated, while the range of trades to which the Acts can be applied has been made considerably wider. In addition, by provisions of special importance in time of economic stress, the period necessary for the legal establish-ment of rates of wages by Trade Boards already in existence has been reduced considerably. Before the Act of 1918, nine months elapsed before wage rates became legally enforceable. This period has now been reduced to three months.The result of these greater facilities, and of the conviction of the Government that the nine years&apos; experience gained in the operation of the earlier Trade Boards Act, fully justified its wider application, is to be seen in the rapid establishment of new Trade Boards. The Act of 1909, together with the Trade Boards (Provisional Orders) Confirmation Act of 1913, were applied to only nine industries or trades, Boards being setup however, in some cases for Ireland as well as Great Britain.  Already under the Act of 1918, Trade Boards.
have been established which affect six additional industries. New Trade Boards are now in operation for the boot and shoe repairing industry, the brush and broom industry, the corset industry, the paper bag industry and the tobacco industry, in Great Britain. , Special Orders have also been made or published which will involve the early establishment of eighteen new Trade Boards in Great Britain, and seven in Iceland, the latter Boards being parallel to Boards to be established in Great Britain for trades which are also carried on to a considerable extent in Ireland. These Boards are already in process of formation. Preparations are well advanced for the establishment of Trade Boards in other industries, and notices of intention to make special orders have been published in these cases,Noticeable activity has been shown recently by the Trade Boards in the use of their powers under the Acts to fix minimum rates of wages, the general minimum time rates or piece-rates, or overtime rates. In eight out of the nine industries where rates had already been fixed and varied from time to time under the Act of 1909, increased rates have now been proposed involving in most cases an appreciable rise. Thus, in the case of women&apos;s wages, the Paper Box Trade Board for Great Britain, for example, has proposed an in-crease of the general minimum time rate from 5%d. to Sd. an hour; the Shirt-Making Trade Board for Great Britain has proposed an increase from Qd. to Sd. an hour; and the Tailoring Board for Great Britain an increase from 5d. to 8-3-^. In the tin box industry, the rise proposed in Great Britain for women is from h\d. to 1\d. The rates for women proposed by the newly established Trade Boards lie on or about the same level. Thus, in the brush and broom industry it is proposed that the general minimum time rate for . women should be S\d. an hour, in the corset industry S\d., and in the paper bag industry 8d., while the proposal in the laundry trade is for a rate of 28s. for a week not exceeding 48 hours. As far as men&apos;s wages are involved, the increases proposed are even more considerable. Thus, in the dollied and tommied chain trade it is proposed to raise the minimum time rate for men from a scale ranging from $\d. to 10(i an hour to one ranging from Is. 5d. to Is. lid. In the paper box trade, the proposal is to raise the men&apos;s rate from 9d. to Is. lfd and in the tailoring trade from Sd. to Is. Id. The rate fixed for men by the recently established Tobacco Trade Board is Is. lfd. Thus, in general, in the industries brought within the scope of the Trade Boards Act, the view generally taken is that a fair wage for women lies in the neighbourhood of Sd. an hour, and for men at a little over Is.Part III. Press Comments.(1) The Labour and Socialist Press. (A) Foreign Affairs.Russia.The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; fears that the Government may take advantage of the absorp-tion of the people in internal affairs to pursue a foreign policy which the country has condemned. There are no signs, it says, that Mr. Churchill is abandoning the Eussian Campaign, while, in addition to this help to Koltchak and Denikin, it is proposed to impose a &quot; pacific blockade &quot; on Russia. &quot; Justice &quot; and the &quot; Clarion &quot; combine with the &quot;Labour Leader&quot; in denouncing intervention. The &quot;Socialist&quot; contains a violent attack on Mr. Clynes for refusing to countenance direct action in order to stop the war on Russia. &quot; Justice &quot; prints the first of a series of articles by V. I. Issaiev on the - Nationalisation of Industry in Soviet Russia,&quot; in which he describes the present Bolshevist organisation of industry as a network of bureaucratic institutions which overlap one another and involve enormous expenditure. The &quot; Democrat &quot; contains a hostile account of conditions under the Bolshevist regime. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; publishes an article on &quot; How a City Soviet is Elected,&quot; which is taken from an account of the Elections to the Moscow Soviet in April, 1918. The paper also contains a report from the Russian Delegates Committee on the harsh treatment meted out to Russians recently deported from this country.Other.The &quot; New Statesman &quot; contains an article on &quot; The League of Nations.&quot; In spite of many obstacles, it believes that there is good ground for hoping that the American Senate will eventually ratify the Peace Treaty, and enable the League to begin its work. The paper summarises the four &quot; reservations &quot; which have caused so much dispute in the American Senate ; and it goes on to enumerate the various problems which are awaiting solution by the League.  Apart from the American difficulties, it is thought that much
of the recent antagonism to the League has calmed down ; for instance, the opposition to admitting Germany and Austria has certainly declined. TheNew Statesman&quot;-stresses its opinion that even a perfectly organised League will not make a paradise if the people themselves remain indifferent. For this reason the paper welcomes the campaign pf instruction inaugurated at the recent Mansion House meeting. In the &quot;Labour Leader &quot; there, is an account of Mrs, Philip Snowden&apos;s visit to Austria.(B) Home Affairs.The Railway Strike.The discussion of the Railway Strike in this week&apos;s papers is voluminous. The majority of the articles were written after the settlement of the strike, and are written with the object of emphasising the lessons that may be learnt from it. There is a con-centration in the I.L.P. papers upon the need for the strengthening of the political side of the Labour movement. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; deals also with the wages question generally, and assumes that the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act will have to be extended again for a further period. It does not think, however, that such extension will aid in the settlement of the problem unless the Government publicly announces its adherence to the principle that negotiations for a permanent post-war basis of wages shall take place upon a formula accepting in principle present wages as permanent minima. There is no reference of importance to the scheme for the establishment of a so-called &quot; General Staff&quot; for the Labour movement, but many papers glance at the use made of the Press in the strike. The &quot; Railway Review &quot; confines itself to reporting the negotiations and meetings in the course of the week it reviews and to thanking the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; for its services.(a) The Settlement of the Strike. Mr. Philip Snowden expresses his opinion in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; that taking the terms of settlement as a whole the railwaymen have gained their substantial point, in that they have forced the Government &quot; to withdraw the &apos; definitive &apos; terms which were to begin to operate in six months&apos; time.&quot; The out-standing fact, he thinks, is that the Government after having put the country to the cost of a nine days&apos; strike have accepted terms which would have avoided a strike had they been accepted at the conferences preceding the stoppage. The responsibility for the strike is attributed to the Government, and Mr. Snowden suggests that the Govern-ment onlv decided to end the strike when thev discovered that the men were solid and that the strike would extend to other industries unless they modified their attitude. Mr. Snowden bases two general observations on the strike and its settlement. Firstly, he regards the settlement which he calls a truce as typical of the work of the Prime Minister, who, he says, &quot; never settles anything.&quot; &quot; The railway strike is-another case of the failure of the Government.&quot; Secondly, he refers to the attitude taken up by part of the Press towards the strike in general and Mr. J. H. Thomas in particular, and concludes that &quot; the settlement of the strike was a disappointment to these people,&quot; and that &quot; Labour leaders should beware of the flattery of the employers and their Press.&quot;Mr. F. W. Jowett, in the &quot; Bradford Pioneer,&quot; develops the theory he put forth in last week&apos;s issue of this paper. The formation of the railway executive in 1914 he ascribes merely to the chaos and inefficiency of the pre-war railway system, which made it impossible to expect it to cope with war needs without some re-organisation. This fact he thinks ought to have led to the nationalisation of the railways, but such nationalisation he suggests was desired neither by the Government nor by the railway companies. Therefore he thinks the railway executive-&quot; a syndicate of railway owners &quot; was deliberately set up in order to avoid nationalisation. It is against this syndicate and its representative in the Cabinet (the Minister of Transport is a &quot; railway magnate &quot;) that Mr. Jowett thinks the railwaymen struck. This syndicate, in Mr. Jowetfs opinion, was endeavouring to reduce railwaymen&apos;s wages in order that it might not have to increase the rates for the conveyance of goods. Mr. Jowett then proceeds to analyse the position of the Prime Minister. &quot; Mr. Lloyd George took his instructions from Sir Eric Geddes as long as he dared to do so.&quot; The Prime Minister knew, thinks Mr. Jowett, &quot; when he penned his infamous manifesto in which he alleged that the railwaymen were acting under the influence of anarchists,&quot; that &quot;the allegation was untrue.&quot; The Prime Minister, again, thinks Mr. Jowett, was primarily responsible for the &quot; dastardly and costly advertisements which with deliberate cunning were framed to create the impression tha^the railwaymen had been offered a minimum.of 40s. in pre-war value.&quot;Sir Leo Chiozza Money shares the belief of Mr. Snowden that the railwaymen have won a victory and that their victory is due to the threat of the &quot; ad hoc Trade Union Congress &quot; called for the 7th October.  He thinks that the history of the strike is yet another example
of how much &quot; successive Governments suffer from being in contact with London rather than with the real heart of the country.&quot; Sir Leo describes one of the posters, issued in order to explain the Governments offer, as false, and then proceeds to discuss the general movement of prices, and decides that, even granted a reduction in prices by 25 per cent., the highest wage at present earned by any of the grades represented by the N.U.R. is insufficient. He expresses the opinion : &quot; If any margin arises for the worker through a fall in the cost of living, it is due to him and overdue &quot; ; and suggests as an immediate policy, that &quot; Labour should not concede any reduction whatever in present money rates of pay.&quot; Sir Leo Money contributes also an article to &quot; Forward,&quot; written apparently before the settlement of the strike, in which he develops the theory that the Government has entered &quot; upon a definite policy of attacking Labour by sections and of endeavouring to incite the community as a whole against the sections which it attacks.&quot;Mr. Ramsay Macdonald also writes in &quot; Forward &quot; before the news of the settlement of the strike had reached him. He is convinced that there are men in responsible positions in the Government &quot; who have been acting for a long time on the assumption that Labour had to be fought, that the full resources of the Government should be used against the men, and that the fight should be to a finish.&quot; Mr. Macdonald therefore regards the strike as a struggle between the railwaymen and the State; and from this follows his opinion that &quot; never was there such a demonstration of Labour&apos;s need of political authority.&quot; In con-clusion he refers to the relation between wages and prices, and decides that &quot; until Labour tackles the problem of prices, which is purely a political problem to-day, Labour will never settle the problem of wages.&quot; &apos;In a leading article the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; confirms Mr. Snowden&apos;s opinion that it was the fact that the &quot; other large Trade Unions were preparing to take common action with the N.U.R., that brought the Government to a more reasonable attitude of mind.&quot; The writer of this article is, however, more concerned to impress upon trade unionists two lessons, which, he says, may be learnt from the strike. The first lesson is that strikes are the outcome of an economic system in which the owners of capital and wage-workers are in direct and constant conflict. The second lesson is the vital necessity of Labour con-trolling the Government. i: If Labour had been the Government there would have been no strike.&quot; In another leading article in this paper the opinion is expressed that the Government quite realise that the end of industrial trouble is not in sight. The continuance of the emergency transport system, and the formation of so-called Citizen Guards are pointed to as proofs of the preparations the Government is making &quot; to suppress industrial unrest.&quot; The measures the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; thinks that the Labour movement must take to answer these preparations are firstly propaganda in the country, and secondly the putting of more energy into the Parliamentary Labour Party.The opinions of the local Labour papers do not as a whole throw much additional light on the issues. Articles from the &apos;&apos; Worker &quot; and the Merthyr &quot; Pioneer &quot; may, however, be mentioned. The &quot; Worker &quot; shares the opinions of Mr. Snowden and the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; that it was fear of what might happen at the Trade Union Conference summoned for Tuesday, the 7th inst., that induced the Government to determine the strike, and adds the opinion (which is also expressed by Mr. William Stewart in &quot; Forward &quot;) that it was the effect this fear was having upon financial circles that impressed the Government. This paper regards the settlement as a mere truce and urges Labour to make preparations for increasing its influence in both national and municipal government. Municipal government is important because, &quot; had the strike continued, the necessity for labour to control some functions of local government would have become very apparent.&quot; The Merthyr &quot; Pioneer &quot; regrets that the form in which the settlement was announced did not convey a clearer impression that the N.U.R. had won a great victory. &quot; We are inclined to despair that it is Labour&apos;s invariable custom to show such gracious leniency to a defeated enemy.&quot; The opinion that &quot; Le Matin &quot; formed that the Prime Minister had won a moral victory is quoted in support of this contention. Another article is devoted in this paper to discussing whether there is such a thing as public opinion, and, if there is, whether it is fever worthy of consideration. The conclusion arrived at is that &quot; if there is to be a moral obligation upon Labour to withhold its hand until public opinion has received due consideration, public opinion must learn that it, too, has a moral obligation to consider the occasion for strife and to remove it before it has reached the actual pass of conflict.&quot;The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; continues to regard the strike as a preliminary struggle in a social revolution. &quot; The Government has tried its strength and found it wanting.&apos;&apos; This paper, however, does not think that what it considers as the defeat of the Government is final. It points out that the Army is not demobilised and that conscription still exists, and therefore Labour is warned to be on the watch and to be ready for the next emergency. The &quot; Socialist &quot; looks upon the railway strike as an episode in the &quot; class struggle &quot; and
regards its peculiar significance as lying in the fact that for the first time in the history of the &quot; class struggle &quot; in this country, the State was compelled to defend itself with every ounce of resistance which it could force to its assistance. In the opinion of this paper, if the strike had continued the workers would have won an outstanding victory, and the Government was only saved.by the readiness with which, the N.U.R. leaders &quot; built a bridge for the defeated and flying foe.&quot; Two lessons are drawn from the strike by this paper, one that the Parliamentary Labour Party is a useless institution, and the other that the strike has proved that the social revolution will come as a consequence of some minor grievance arising on the industrial field, and therefore that Labour must perfect its indus-trial rather than its political machinery.The &quot; Nation &quot; is interested in the political results of the strike and expresses the opinion that its conclusion means that the Government is stripped of all moral and material credit, which fact is made all the more important by the prestige earned by the 14 Trade Unionist mediators. The great advantage of the year;s truce, in the opinion of this paper, is that it will allow labour to resume its proper importance in the Parliamentary counsels of the nation and will make it possible for the &quot;first significant result of the Prime Ministers domestic policy, namely, the driving of all but a rump of Trade Unionism out of Parlia-ment,&quot; to be remedied. The &quot; New Statesman,&quot; on the other hand, is more interested in the industrial effects of the strike. The men, this paper thinks, were taught that&apos;&apos; they could not hold the country up to ransom, and bull)&apos;&apos; or bluff it into surrender.&quot; The public learnt, however, that it was impossible to hold to the opinion that there was a revolutionary move-ment behind the strike. These two lessons, thinks the &quot; New Statesman,&quot; will have the effect of considerably reducing the temperature of the industrial world. The concrete result of the strike is that wages in one of the largest and worst paid trades in the country have become definitely stabilised at war level for twelve months to come and the importance of this to the &quot; New Statesman &quot; lies in the fact that &quot; inevitably all other trades will have to follow suit.&quot; In another part of this paper Lord Haig is complimented upon the &quot; dis-cretion and good sense with which the troops were kept out of sight durirg the greater part of the strike.&quot; The &quot; New Age &quot; is most interested in the effect the strike will have upon the prospects of nationalisation. &quot; The interim character of the State&apos;s present control must not be allowed to obscure the fact that in all probability the State&apos;s permanent control of the railways would be characterised by still more unscrupulous diplomacy.&quot; &quot; If the movement towards nationalisation is not immediately dropped by the miners and rail-waymen, we shall know that there are men incapable of learning even by experience.&quot; This interest of the &quot; New Age &quot; in nationalisation does not however prevent it making a reference to the problem of prices, and asking Avhether the fixing of nominal wage rates is of any use to the railwaymen. &quot; It is in the highest degree probable that the nominal wages obtained by the railwaymen, whatever their amount in figures, will only serve to cover the cost of subsistence and progressively less even with this.&quot;The opinion of &quot; Justice &quot; is astonishingly similar on one point to that of the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; and the &quot; Worker.&quot; The loyalty and discipline of the railwaymen is commended, but it is. urged that these qualities must be turned into constructive channels and that for the moment these should be political channels. &quot; Every effort must be made to strengthen the Labour Party locally as well as nationally.&quot; In the &quot; Clarion,&quot; Mr. A. M. Thompson shows that he has been impressed with the statesmanship of Mr. Thomas in restraining the discontent of his members during the war. Nevertheless he thinks that Mr. Thomas was wrong in calling a strike when he did. The lesson of the strike to Mr. Thompson is the discovery that motor-transport can be employed for other purposes quite as usefully as for the conveyance of war material. The opinion the &quot; British Citizen &quot; adopts may be shown by quoting a phrase from it: &quot; the criminal stupidity of a handful of men controlling the machine of the Railway Union.&quot; The &quot; British. Citizen &quot; thinks that the strike has shown the danger of leaving to union executives the power to call a strike without first taking a ballot of members. The strike, it is maintained, has &quot; ignomini-ously failed.&quot; Mr. W. A. Appleton shows himself more concerned with the lot of &quot; non-combatants &quot; in industrial disputes. He views the struggle as one between a Government elected &quot; by majority suffrage &quot; and &quot; an oligarchy of a new type,&quot; but thinks that for each side it was a reconnaissance rather than a battle and that the settlement of the strike is only the calling of a truce.(b) The Printers and the StriJce-Mi. Philip Snowden does not seem pleased with the participation of newspaper compositors in the strike controversy. He expresses the opinion in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; that the freedom of the Press is a possession, which must I not lightly be interfered with. The proper way, he thinks, for trade unionists to deal with the power of the capitalist press is to support a press of their own. The verdict of the &quot; New Age &quot; is substantially the same.   The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; however, is very
much pleased with this development, and suggests that the printers should extend their interference to the &quot; lies circulated about the Bolsheviks.&quot; Many papers complain of the advertising campaign conducted by the Government to explain the issues on which the strike occurred, and the &quot; Nation &quot; suggests that it was mistaken policy to use such propa-ganda, if it was adopted with the idea of breaking the discipline of the N.U.R. The comment of the &quot; Railway Review &quot; is that &quot; when members of the National Union of Journalists learn like humble newspaper mechanics that there are limits to what may be done for a master, the Trade Union fight for organised life may be subject to some show of fairness.&quot;The Industrial and Political Outlook.- The &quot;Nation,&quot; in an article entitled &quot;The Future of Industry,&quot; thinks that if a general strike had been the outcome of the railway stoppage, the objects of such a strike would have been widened from a bare wage claim so as to include a general Labour Charter, presumably on the lines of the official Labour Party programme of last year. In the opinion of the paper, the &quot; revolution,&quot; if it had come about, under the leadership of such moderates as Messrs. Henderson, Thomas and Clynes, would have resulted in little more than the resignation of the Cabinet by means of a hostile vote in the Commons. A more important point, however, thinks the &quot; Nation,&quot; is the probable contents of the Labour Charter, which would be put forward as the basis of a general strike ; and this paper goes on to analyse the demand for a share in the control of industry, a demand which it thinks would probably figure prominently in the Charter. In mentioning the schemes already advanced in various countries for joint control in industry, the official scheme for the socialisation of the German coal mines receives special attention. Mr. Clifford Allen contributes an article to the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; in which he points out the dangers of nationalisation as expounded by State Socialists &quot; whereby bureaucracy threatens individual liberty.&quot; Mr. Allen advocates a system of Guild Socialism. He also expresses his approval of the use of direct action for so-called political objects, although he still professes to retain a firm belief in democratic rule. He argues that we cannot properly apply the theory of democracy until we have a greater measure of economic equality. The &quot;Democrat&quot; accuses direct actionists of taking no trouble to gain the support of public opinion ; while &quot; Justice &quot; calls for more reliable and solid types of leaders of the working class; &quot; not pacifists such as Mr. Ramsay Macdonald nor lightning strikers such as Mr. Smillie.&quot;Economy and Increased Production.The Government&apos;s alleged extravagance, in spite of its&apos; exhortation to the workers to increase production, is commented on in several papers. The &quot; Nation &quot; says that the real test of the Governments intentions in the way of economy will be its handling of the fighting services ; for no economies worth mentioning can be effected by a reduction of the Civil Service estimates. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; and the &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; point to the war in Russia as an entirely unjustifiable waste of money. The latter paper and the &quot; Clarion &quot; suggest that the full excess profits tax should be reimposed, as the extravagance of the rich is one of the causes which make the working man loath to increase production. According to the &quot; Clarion &quot; a further reason for this inertia lies in the fact that the workers believe improved organisation would achieve more than the greatest possible amount of energy expended on their part; to counteract the effect of this idea the Government is urged to regulate production so as to concentrate employment on the manufacture of essentials. In the opinion of the &quot;Workers&apos; Dread-nought &quot; those who talk of increased production mean inwardly increased profits, and when they bewail the sad industrial future of the country, they are really worrying about the future of their own dividends.Other.The &quot; Worker,&quot; in an article on Nationalisation of the Coal Mines, draws attention to the following points that the coalowners, during the war, derived profits from by-products which.did not come under the Coal Control, and further, they were allowed to accumulate a reserve fund for repairs after the war, free of income tax. The middle-man&apos;s profit under the competitive system is referred to as one of the unnecessary costs. &quot; Justice &quot; strongly urges the necessity of establishing the Food Ministry as a permanent department. The &quot; Yorkshire Factory Times &quot; contains an article by Mr. C. A. McCurdy, K.C., M.P., in praise of national restaurants; he advocates their establishment to tide over the prolonged period of high prices foreshadowed by the Food Minister.
2Q(2) Ex-Service Metis Periodicals.The &quot; Ex-Service Man &quot; discusses this week increased production, loans for ex-Service men and pensions.Increased Production.The paper contains two articles emphasising the need for increased production ; it says that war-weariness can no longer be used as an excuse for slacking ; and points out the disquieting fact that defeat has made the Germans realise that their only salvation lies in work.Loans for Ex-Service Men.A suggestion is made that a National Ex-Service Men&apos;s Credit Bank should be started to provide loans for men wishing to set up in business ; and a scheme is outlined for the establishment of such a bank.Pensions.The paper strongly supports the decentralisation of the Ministry of Pensions&apos; machine, and points out that if local interest were stimulated, decentralisation schemes would facilitate the solution of many problems which cannot be satisfactorily or humanely dealt with through the medium of a centralised official machine.&quot; The Bulletin,&quot; the official organ of the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers, a fortnightly publication, advances a policy for the settlement of ex-soldiers on the land. Among the points emphasised are included security of tenure and compensation for all improvements, the ultimate aim being the public ownership of the land. The paper wishes to discover whether ex-Soldiers prefer to work for wages or to cultivate their own small holdings, and for this purpose a form is provided with the appropriate questions to be filled in by all ex-Service men wishing to settle on the land.(3) The Press on Demobilisation and Resettlement.Unemployment Problems.The &quot; Daily Chronicle &quot; of the 15th inst. contains a protest on behalf of the disabled soldiers training as electrical workers at Croydon against the treatment they are alleged to be receiving at the hands of the authorities. They complain that the Government is unable to &quot; place them in the jobs for which they have been trained &quot; ; and further, that it was suddenly decided to discontinue their training and their subsistence allowances; and this is considered a breach of contract on the part of the State. The paper is informed by a local official of the E.T.U. that there had been no difficulty in finding jobs for men who were in the Union, since the union had broken its rules specially for such disabled men and although they had not completed their period of training, Was prepared to admit them as members.The &quot; Nottingham Guardian &quot; of the 8th inst. prints a leading article dealing with the local unemployment situation ; it complains that the men have been demobilised faster than there was any need to demobilise them, and added to this, the trade unionists are making it more difficult than it need have been for discharged men to obtain jobs.Part IV. General Topics.National Industrial Conference.A meeting of the Trade Union side of the Provisional Joint Committee of the National Industrial Conference will be. held on the 16th inst., when it is intended to discuss, first, the question of the consolidation of war wages ; second, the proposals for the formation of a general staff for labour ; and, third, the obstacles from the Trade Union standpoint which have been created by the 48-hour Bill to the setting up of a permanent National Industrial Council. It will be remembered that at the meeting of the Trade Union side of this Committee on the 24th September it announced that it was unable to proceed
with the formation of the proposed National Industrial Council until the Government had agreed to cany the recommendations of the Joint Committee fully into effect.Labour Organisation.One result of the railway strike was to bring home to labour its lack of any effective organisation for dealing with such a situation as actually arose. The hastily improvised Mediation Committee did effective work, and its success made labour in general realise as never before not only the possibilities of an effective central organisation but also the necessity of placing it on a permanent basis. Hence, the suggestions of Avhich the Press has been full of a General Staff for Labour and a Supreme Labour Council. Such demands are, of course, not new. For a considerable time certain elements in the labour world have been fully aware of the necessity of such an organisation, and have advocated its establish-ment. Some hopes were entertained that the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress might after considerable reorganisation be able to discharge the functions of a General Staff in co-ordinating the forces of labour in the industrial sphere and in giving expression to the common policy of labour from time to time. But the Parlia-mentary Committee has been unable to reform itself, and it signally failed to rise to the occasion during the recent strike. In these circumstances the general tendency of re-sponsible labour leaders seems to be to advocate some inclusive body which might be formed by bringing together the Trade Union side of the Joint Industrial Conference, representatives of the Triple Alliance, the Labour Party Executive and the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress. Such a body, it is maintained, would be a responsible and authoritative council of labour, and would be able to speak in the name of both the industrial and the political wings of the movement. Both the Parliamentary Committee and the Trade Union side of the National Industrial Conference have discussed the matter, or will discuss it within the next few days.Nationalisation of the Mines.On the 9th inst., the Prime Minister received a deputation from the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress and the Executive of the M.F.G.B., who com-municated to him the resolution on nationalisation of the mines passed at the Congress in Glasgow, and presented the case for the miners through Messrs. Smillie, Hodges and Brace. The Prime Minister announced that the Government had come definitely to the conclusion that they could not see their Way to advise Parliament to pass a measure for taking over as a business of the State the management of the mines of the country, and stated that the Government adhered to the proposals already made for buying out the mineral royalties and for nationalising coal deposits, for raising funds to improve the miners&apos; conditions of life, and. for obtaining powers to give the miners an effective voice in the control of the industry by means of Pit Committees, and if the unification scheme is adopted, by means of representation on the District Boards. But the Prime Minister insisted that the main question of the nationalisation of the industry Was both a great economic question, which affects the industrial life of the nation in all its branches, and a great political issue, which like every other political issue must be decided by the nation as a whole. It must not be imagined from the quietness with which the miners have taken the Prime Ministers strong statement of the Governments determination not to nationalise the industry that their &quot; will to succeed &quot; has in any way been weakened. As Mr. Frank Hodges has said, the miners have a strategic policy, and in accordance with that it is their great desire to enlist public opinion on their side. They have no present intention of attempting to secure any problematic tactical advantage as a result of a successful strike. Their policy is the larger one of enlisting such a number of allies and making such a strategic disposition of their forces that they will gain their objective in the end without a blow being struck. The leaders of the M.F.G.B., having obtained the official support of the whole Trade Union movement, now intend to make a vigorous attempt to bring the nation as a whole round to their way of thinking. It was very noticeable that Mr. Frank Hodges, at the great demonstration.at the Albert Hall on the 11th inst., Went out of his way to appeal for the support of the audience on the ground that their interests as consumers would be benefited by nationalisation, and it may be expected that in the campaign which will now be undertaken by the M.F.G.B. the note that will be stressed will be the advantage likely to accrue to the community as consumers of coal if the.mines are nationalised. It has not yet been definitely announced whether a special Trades Union Congress will be held to consider the situation. In any case, it is very improbable that such a special congress will take place until after the Washington Conference.
Consolidation of War Wages.It is reported, that a common policy is in preparation by the trade unions for all industries concerned in the question of the consolidation of war. wages, and that a demand -will be made for the stabilisation of existing war wages until the 30th September, 1920. The provisional settlement reached in the ironfounders&apos; strike is the first instance of the operation of the natural tendency to follow the terms in this respect of the railway agree-ment. It will be remembered that, as was mentioned in last week&apos;s Report, p. 307, the Parliamentary Committee of the T.U.C. has appointed a committee to go into this matter, and it, is expected that a special Trade Union conference may be called to discuss the question of the standardisation of wages and the adjustment and merging of war bonuses into standard rates of wages in all trades.Police Union.The agitators in the Police Union are still making efforts to secure the effective support of Labour in their cause. A deputation of the Union, which was received by the Par-liamentary Committee of the T.U.C. on the 9th inst., made an appeal that some action should.be taken on their behalf in the direction of preparing a Bill to repeal certain clauses in the Police Act and of making some effort to get the men who had been discharged reinstated.The Clapham Labour Party organised a demonstration on the 12th inst., in favour of the Police Union. Mr. A. Oliver, of the N.U.R. pointed out that the reinstatement of the railwaymen provided a precedent in accordance with which they could secure reinstate-ment of the police strikers. Their duty was to get the police back first and then obtain a repeal of the Police Act. In this connection a deputation would meet the Government in the next three weeks. Mr. Hayes announced that the Parliamentary Committee of the T.TJ.C. were making the necessary provision for the children of the strikers.Ex-Officers.The Secretary of the Mercantile Marine Service Association states that a scheme is being considered whereby ex-naval officers will be enabled to purchase Admiralty trawlers by instalments. The formation is reported of a &quot; Sam Browne &quot; circle, with offices at 32, Victoria Street, as a definite self-help circle for fit ex-officers. Hitherto, all such societies have catered for the disabled.Amalgamation.The result of the long continued negotiations for the amalgamation of the engineering trade unions will soon be known, as the 9th inst. was the last day for sending in the ballot papers (see this Report, p. 164).It is reported that the Nuneaton Branch of the Railway Clerks&apos; Association has passed a resolution calling for a conference to go into the question of the fusion of the R.C.A. and the N.U.R. It may be recalled that the R.C. A. considered this matter about two years ago, and reported against it. On that occasion the annual conference, after debating the question, referred it to the executive committee with an instruction that they should get into touch with the N.U.R. and consider the possibility of formulating a scheme of amal-gamation. As a result of this, the R.C.A. executive reported strongly against amalgama-tion, while stating that their opposition was not to be regarded as final and permanent. , Though the situation has changed somewhat since then, and the much improved relations between the N.U.R. and the A.S.L.E. &amp; F. encourage the idea of one completely com-prehensive industrial union of all railway employees, it may be doubted whether the R.C.A. will view the question of amalgamation any more favourably now than it did then. Its own position is probably stronger now than it was then, it is fairly well satisfied with its recent settlement with the Railway Executive Committee, and it probably feels as strongly now as it did then the doubt whether in future the manual workers would be prepared to support its claims for what they would be inclined to regard as preferential treatment for the clerical grades, and whether its association with manual workers might not hamper its efforts to bring the higher clerical and managerial grades within its organisation.It is stated that efforts are being made to bring about an amalgamation of the British Seafarers&apos; Union, the National Sailors&apos; and Firemen&apos;s Union, and the Ships&apos; Cooks and Stewards&apos; Union.&apos;With reference to the proposed amalgamation between the General Union of Operative-Carpenters and Joiners and the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters, Cabinet Makers and
Joiners (see Report, p. 99) it is announced that the members of the latter society have voted by a large majority in favour of amalgamation.Trade Union Topics.United Operative Plumbers&apos; and Domestic Engineers&apos; Association. The Executive of this Union intimates in its Report that whenever plumbers&apos; work is being done by work-men other than plumbers, this fact should immediately be reported to the lodge secretary, so that -appropriate action may be taken. It states that cases of encroachment on plum-bers&apos; work are becoming very frequent, and instances specially cases where substitutes for lead are being used.;Operative House and Ship Painters and Decorators. In the current number of the quarterly report of this Society, the general secretary, Mr. J. A. Gibson, expresses the opinion that shorter hours have got to come, but this reform will not be brought about by any spasmodic action of any particular district. The matter must be dealt with nationally and by constitutional methods.Operative Stone Masons&apos; Society. In the current number of the journal of this society, the general secretary abuses some of the General Labourers&apos; Unions for conspiring with the quarry employers to keep the Stone Masons&apos; Society oft the Joint Industrial Council for the Quarrying Industry. &quot; A more unwarrantable action on the part of representatives of so-called Unions of Labour against the oldest and best reputed trade union in the wide world can hardly be conceived.&quot; It is clear that the old differences between the craft unions and general labour unions have by no means disappeared.Scottish Painters&apos; Society. In the monthly journal of this Society, attention is called to &quot;the present position in Perth Railway Station, where the National Union of Railwaymen are doing all they can to assist unskilled labour to oust tradesmen from their, craft.&quot; Owing to the fact that labourers were started to paint, the painters struck work with the exception of one, who is a member of the N.U.R. and he is now supervising the work of the labourers. The painters declare that the N.U.R. are blacklegging them, and the journal, hopes that the dispute will be a lesson to the painters who are members of the N.U.R.Friendly Society of Iron Founders. In the current issue of the Journal of this Society details are given of the voting of branches on the question of withdrawal from the General Federation of Trade Unions and from the Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Federa-tion. The majority in favour of the former was 2,350, and of the latter 1,8.01. On the other hand, a majority of 14,495 voted in favour of amalgamation with the Amalgamated Coremakers and the Associated Ironmoulders of Scotland.1 It is stated in the Journal of this Society that arrangements were made with the Co-operative Wholesale Society Banking Department that branches of the Ironfounders&apos; Society having Deposit Accounts would be able to withdraw at call. There is evidence that there is a strong movement in favour of Trade Unions&apos; funds being, whenever possible, deposited, with the C.W.S.General Iron Fitters&apos; Association.-In the current issue of the Report of this Society, the general secretary dealing with the problem of output, declares &quot; if we are to maintain our pre-war output per man, it follows side issues apart that we are going to have as many unemployed on the market as we had in pre-war time. Until the powers that be realise that the first of all great problems unemployment is part of and cannot be separated from the output question, until they make a serious endeavour to solve the unemployment problem, we cannot advise the workers to enter into the question of out-put.&quot; This statement is interesting as a vigorous presentation of a most fallacious argument which is doing a good deal to restrict production, namely, the view that the more work one man does the less there will be for his mates.National Amalgamated Furnishing Trade Association. The General Secretary of this Association, in the current issue of the monthly report, also deals with the question of output. He also maintains that if production were greatly increased, trade would boom for a time, and then a reaction with unemployment on a scale previously unknown would take place. He insists that there appears to be a sufficiency of production, because hundreds of thousands can live well without pretending to produce any of the things they consume.National Leather Trades Federation. The report of a committee meeting of the Curriers and Heavy Chrome Section of this Federation contains three interesting resolutions on demarcation, non-Unionism and amalgamation. The Committee resolved not to sit with any representative of the Workers&apos; Union on National Committees, it recommended the
advisability of national or local action against non-Union or female labour with a view to the establishment of full Trade Union shops in all districts, and it recommended to the National Leather Trades Federation the amalgamation of all separate societies.National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks. The London Wholesale Textile Section of this Union reports that it is making rapid progress in the organisation of the workers employed in the City Wholesale Textile Houses. The Branch Committee and House Committees are very active, and it is expected that they will conduct a successful campaign for increase of membership during the winter.National Amalgamated Union of Labour. The quarterly report of this Union contains an interesting resume of the causes of industrial unrest by Mr. J. N. Bell, general secretary. He refers to the anxiety displayed by certain people on account of the alleged Bolshevism in our midst, and continues, &quot; If they could bring themselves to realise that we are barely finished with the greatest war in history, that millions of men and women have been taken away from their accustomed work, and have not had time or opportunity to settle down again to their old or to their new avocations ; that hundreds of thousands of people, willing to pay for the privilege, cannot find a home to live in ; that hundreds of thousands more are out of work, and are daily sneered at because they accept the out-of-work pay, which they would gladly exchange for work at reasonable wages if they could find it; that something over three millions of soldiers, whose ears were filled, while they were in the trenches with, stories of the magnificent wages that were being earned, and the glorious times that were being enjoyed by their fellow-workmen at home, have returned to find that these tales were a mean and dispicable distortion of the truth, and that the high rates of pay have, in tens of thousands of instances, not even kept pace with the rise in the cost of living; if they will recall these things, they may find a sufficient explanation of the prevailing unrest without seeking fantastic explanations in the supposed spread of some-thing which they call Bolshevism.&quot;Workers&apos; Union. An interesting side-issue in the old controversy between unions of different structure is exemplified in a criticism, which appears in the current issue of the Record of this Union, of the attitude of certain craft unions towards the training of disabled men. This article declares that the group which is almost entirely responsible for this attitude is the so-called skilled unions in the engineering industry, and the leaders of the opposition to disabled men are those who took refuge in the engineering trades during the war. These men &quot; joined an organisation that is composed of skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled, but which keeps up the fiction of skill, and are now working hard to keep other men out of the industry on the grounds of protecting that industry.&quot;Russia.The agitation with regard to the attitude of the Government to Russia still continues; but it may be suggested that it will gradually grow formal and academic, now, that all British troops have been withdrawn from Russia. The force of the protest of organised labour against British relations with the Soviet Government Was derived mainly from the knowledge that British lives were being sacrificed in North Russia and from the suspicion that the existence of the North Russian Expeditionary Force was in some unexplained way connected with the continuance of conscription. It must, of course, be expected that the agitation will continue, but it has now entered on a new and much less dangerous phase, for it will probably no longer be reinforced by Trade Unionism as a whole, which is not likely to allow a socialistic sense of &quot; international solidarity &quot; to inconvenience it unduly, especially as it has so much of domestic import to pre-occupy it. The new phase of the agitation was initiated on the 11th inst., at the Albert Hall demonstration, when to the old demands, which are now hardly significant, was added the claim that the Govern-ment should conclude peace with the de facto Governments of Russia, and open diplomatic relations with them. It may be suggested that if and when this becomes the only demand in connection with Russia, such an emasculated programme is little likely to arouse serious passions.Labours International Relations.International Labour Conference, Washington.^-The British Labour delegation to the Conference will include Messrs. Stuart Bunning, A. Henderson, M.P., C. W. Bowerman. M.P., J. Sexton, M.P., Tom Shaw, M.P., A. Onions, M.P., Miss Mary Macarthur and Miss Margaret Bondfield. M. Jouhaux has announced that the International Syn-dicalists have addressed a letter to the Russian Soviet Government and to workers&apos; organisations in that country in order to ascertain whether they are willing to put into effect the proposal of the International Conference at Amsterdam that a Russian delegation should be sent to Washington.
International Socialist Congress, Geneva. The Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, on the 9th inst. decided to take part in the International Socialist Congress, which is to be held early in February at Geneva, and eight members of the Committee were appointed to attend.International League of Trade Unions. It is reported that the Executive Committee of the International League of Trade Unions has decided (1) to investigate the development of the question of nationalisation in different countries ; (2) to investigate the possibility of reconstructing the trade union movement in countries formerly belonging to the Russian Empire ; (3) to bring about the quicker repatriation of German prisoners from France ; and. (4) to direct the attention of the Allies Governments to the persecution of trade unionists by the new Hungarian Government, and to remonstrate with the German Government for withholding wages from Polish labourers engaged by the former Government.International Transport Workers&apos; Federation. It is announced that the draft con-stitution of the new International Transport Workers&apos; Federation will be discussed at an international meeting to be held at Christiania. All Trade Unions catering for transport workers, including State and municipal traffic employees, are entitled to affiliation. It is proposed to grant support to organisations engaged in industrial disputes by promoting and supporting sympathetic strikes.Building Trade Workers&apos; International. The meeting of the Building Trade Workers&apos; International at Amsterdam ended on the 8th inst. It was decided by a majority made up of German and Scandinavian votes that the headquarters of the International should remain in Germany, whereupon M. Chavin, the French delegate, declined on behalf of his colleagues all further responsibility for the administration and refused to sit on the Executive. England, America and Italy were unrepresented at the meeting, which clearly had little justification for its claim to be international.Part V. Departmental and District Reports. (1) Departmental Reports.Appointments Department.Training Grants Scheme. During the week ending the 3rd October, 309 cases were received from Directorates, and 647 were dealt with by the Grants Committee. In all, 6,019 applications have received sanction. Cases of pharmaceutical training largely exceed any other form of training dealt with. No more of these cases are to be considered pending information from the Pharmaceutical Society as to the number of college vacancies still available for this year.Appointments. On the 3rd October, 18,669 ex-Service men and 3,012 civilians were available for appointment. The total number of applicants known to have been placed was 13,943.Training Department.Training Facilities. Treasury sanction has been given to the taking over of the National Ordnance Factory, New Basford, as a Government Instructional Factory. Accommodation will be provided for 600 men and training will be given in building, electrical contracting, handsewn boot and shoe making, watch and clock repairing, jewellery and silversmithing, furniture and tailoring.Training of Widows and Dependants. The responsibility for the training of widows and dependants of deceased officers and men which formerly rested on the Ministry of Pensions is now transferred to the Ministry of Labour. Up to the 4th October, 1,359 appli-cations had been received for training under the scheme, and 642 cases had been sanctioned. In 262 cases, training had been completed ; and in 230 cases, training had commenced.Employment Department.Prosecution for Fraud. Up to the 10th October, 1,355 cases had been referred to the solicitor with a view to prosecution for attempted fraud in connection with out-of-work donation.   In 543 cases the defendants were fined, in 140 cases sentences of imprisonment were passed, in five cases the defendants were admonished, and in 53 cases they were-bound over.  In 120 cases the summonses were dismissed.
-Court of Arbitration.During the week ending the 11th October, 1919, the Court of Arbitration heard nine cases, the principal, being the following :- , /Metal Trade. An application by the Workers&apos; Union, the National Union of General Workers and the National Society of Metal, Wire and Tube Workers to the National Employers&apos; Federation (Metal Section) that the workmen may be graded into three classes according to the kind of work upon which they are employed, and that the weekly rate for each grade should be  3 10s. id.,  3 18s. 2d., and  4 3s. lOd. respectively.. Joint Industrial Councils Division.Furniture. At a meeting of the Joint Industrial Council held on the 6th October it was reported that, apart from Manchester, the votes in the various districts affected showed a majority against acceptance of the terms of settlement. This majority would be largely increased by the addition of the Manchester figures, which were reported to be 15,000 against the settlement. Since this meeting of the Council the employers&apos; federation have held a meeting and unanimously decided to maintain.the lock-out in all districts at present.Hosiery (Scottish). It has been agreed that the dispute regarding wages in the hosiery trade in Scotland should be referred to arbitration under the Conciliation Act.Trade Boards Division.The Chain Trade Board (Great Britain) at their meeting on the 6th October resolved to vary the general minimum time-rates, and the general minimum piece-rates for the trade as set out in their Notice of Proposal dated the 1st August, 1919, and have asked the Minister to make an Order confirming these rates and specifying the 27th October, 1919, as the date from which they shall become effective. These rates are to remain in operation until the 31st March, 1920. The Trade Board agreed to recommend (under Section 10 of the Trade Boards Act, 1918) to the appropriate Government Department that the present regulations with respect to the restriction of hours for the sale of intoxicating liquors should be continued.&apos; The Tin Box Trade Board (Great Britain) at their meeting of the 10th October, 1919, resolved to vary and to fix the minimum rates of wages set out in their Notice of Proposal dated the 26th July, 1919.New Trade Board. The Minister has established a Trade Board for the Boot and Shoe Repairing Trade (Ireland), and has signed the Regulations with respect to its constitution and proceedings.(2) District Reports.London and South-Eastern.Unemployment. The live register for the week ending the 26th September shows a total decrease of 1,186, of whom 542 are men and 644 are women. The analysis of figures on the register where unemployment is most serious shows that the following occupations are chiefly affected General Labouring, Engineering, and Conveyance. of Men and Goods.General Effects of the Raihvay Strike.- The railway strike has materially increased difficulties of transport and consequent congestion at the docks. At the same time, atten-tion has been directed to the great amount of work which can be done by road-transport.The Policy of Employment Exchanges during the Strike. The policy of the Exchanges in dealing with vacancies occurring through the strike has been the subject of review by a number of Employment Committees. Folkestone Committee supported the action of the Branch Manager in supplying labour to the Local Food Office. The Secretary of the Canterbury Committee stated that transport workers were not supplied with a view to breaking the strike. In.their efforts to supply the men required for the distribution of food and fuel, however, the Exchanges ran the risk of earning the disapproval of Labour members.Shortage of Labour. Ley ton and Acton Committee call attention to the delay in demobilising pattern-makers and moulders, and state that it is seriously retarding dependent trades.Shortage of Transport. From Canterbury, difficulties in obtaining supplies of material for road construction and repair are reported.  It is considered locally from the experience
of the railway strike, that lorries should be made available for the purposes of local authorities and road contractors.Employment of Ex-Service Men. At King&apos;s Cross, 1,270 letters have been forwarded to employers asking for support in the National (Scheme, and 31 employers have accepted &quot; the undertaking.&quot; Canterbury Committee suggests that the percentage should be calculated on the total male staff in the case of firms which employ a majority of women.Training. Enfie]d Women&apos;s Sub-Committee proposes that the Ponders End Shell Works Canteen should be utilised as a training centre. At Redhill, 41 men on the register  including both disabled and non-disabled have expressed their willingness to be trained. Tooting Committee recommends the payment of 100 per cent, disability pension as a wait-ing allowance, to all men accepted for training.Trade Boards. It is stated that the long delay in setting up Trade Boards is a continual source of irritation in the lesser paid industries in this area, and unrest and possible stop-pages must be anticipated in the immediate future.South Midlands and Eastern.Unemployment. The live register for the week ending the 26th September shows an increase of 948, consisting of 895 men and 53 women. Increases are reported from all but 10 committee areas. The furnishing trade lockout is responsible for an increase at High Wycombe. The increase at King&apos;s Lynn and Norwich is accounted for by the completion of harvest work. The end of the holiday season explains the growth of unemployment in Southend.Effect oflronmoulAers&apos; Strike.-Th.e engineering trades in this division are now begin-ning to show the serious effect of the ironmoulders&apos; strike. Short time is being worked at Leicester, and an increase in the numbers on the register is reported at Stamford.Shortage of Labour. -At Leicester, a shortage of skilled carpenters and joiners is delaying progress in building.Shortage of Materials.- Another contributory factor to the delay in building develop-ment at Leicester is a shortage of building materials. Lack of raw material at wholesale clothing works has put additional workers on the register at Colchester.Employment of Ex-Service Men.-Up to the 26th September, approximately 260 firms had stated their readiness to give &quot; undertakings &quot; under the National Scheme for the employment of disabled ex-Service men.South-western.Unemployment. In view of the fact that statistical returns have been suspended owing to the railway strike, it is not possible to give the usual figures dealing with the numbers on the live register this week. Orders for the discharge of 1,500 men from the Royal Dock-yard, Devonport, and a thousand men from Portsmouth Dockyard have been suspended on account of the strike. Comparatively few firms were obliged to close down entirely ; short time working arrangements&apos; were resorted to in many instances, in order to avoid the enforced idleness of a large number of workers.Effects of Ironmoulders&apos; Strike. Engineering firms in this area are now feeling the effects of the ironmoulders&apos; strike. Some are endeavouring to maintain their output with the help of men who have not gone out on strike, but even in these cases, normal delivery cannot be promised.Employment of Ex-Service Men. At Weymouth, it is reported that steps have been taken to make the National Scheme a success, but that the response hitherto has been very poor.Building Trade. It is anticipated that when the housing schemes of Local Authorities are in full swing, there will be a considerable shortage of skilled and partially skilled men in this trade in Devon and Cornwall. There are normally 30,000 men engaged in this industry in the two counties, and for ordinary future requirements it will be necessary to place 4,000 apprentices in the various skilled branches. The Plymouth. Association of Building Trade Employers has approached the Local Education Authority with a proposal to start a junior trade school to assist in the speedy education of apprentices. Cornwall County Council submits that &quot; dilution &quot; in the trade by partially trained men will be necessary, and suggests the establishment of a centre for training the unemployed for this work.
West Midlands.*Unemployment. The live register shows a total decrease for the week ending the 26th September of 1,606 of whom 1,338 are men and 268 are Women. The heaviest decreases are at Birmingham (1,355), Hanley (182), and Hereford (104).General Effects of the Railway Strike. There has been much discussion of the Railway Strike settlement, and one among the many deductions made is that wages generally will be stabilised for a considerable period ahead. The transport problem was successfully tackled in this Division, and in the larger centres there was no appreciable shortage of supplies. The heavy industries, e.g., blast furnaces and iron and steel works, were the greatest sufferers, the chief difficulty being the supply of coal. The vast electrification of industry in Birmingham proved a great boon in every way, and all the big metal-rolling plants were able to keep at work without anxiety as to the supply of power. Export trades like the soft goods trades, depending largely upon foreign markets, received a set-back which will take some time to overcome. In the export hardware trade, individual efforts were successful in averting an entire suspension. In the glass trade, the closing down of export work merely caused a deflection of deliveries to the home market. In the engineering trade, the Metropolitan Carriage &amp; Wagon Company were compelled to close down. The ironmoulders&apos; strike has the greatest share of responsibility for the partial stoppage at Messrs. Avery&apos;s, Ltd., and Messrs. Kynochs, Ltd. In the Oakengates district, 1,000 iron and steel workers were thrown out of employment by the strike. In the West Cannock district about 2,000 miners were temporarily unemployed, owing to shortage of coal trucks. The policy of spreading employment over as long a period as possible by short-time working, was decided on by the Birmingham Engineering Employers&apos; Federation, in the event of a continuance of the strike.Employment of Ex-Service Men. At Oswestry only five out of a total of 76 firms have responded to the appeal of the National Scheme. At Rugby satisfactory replies were received from three firms only out of 48, to whom the appeal was circulated..Yorkshire and East Midlands.   .Unemployment.-^^ statistics were furnished with this week&apos;s report on account of the delay caused by the railway strike. The cotton, woollen and clothing trades are extremely busy. It should be noted, however, that armament firms in Sheffield are claim-ing out-of-work donation on a considerable scale, and it is suggested that the whole subject of the armament trade should be discussed with the employers, with a view to the settlement of the future of their shops.Unemployment Donation. Owing to the increase in the number of applications for payment of out-of-work donation to short-time workers during the past week, the Divi-sional Officer has, under the Special Emergency Regulations, given decisions in a con-siderable number of cases, as to whether payment shall be granted or not. Lincoln Com-mittee protested against the disqualification of certain classes of men, who were thrown out of work by the ironmoulders&apos; strike, and unanimously proposed that every man other than a striker, who is out of work through a strike, should be qualified to receive donation.General Effects of the Railway Strike. It will be a considerable time before normal conditions can be established, as it does not seem likely that the shortage of materials, coal, etc., can be made up to any great extent, unless overtime is worked in those trades which produce raw materials.Effects of Ironmoulders&apos;&apos; Strike. The ironmoulders&apos; strike is now beginning to hav$, serious effects. The following figures may be taken as indicating the number of m&amp;n jm. the engineering trade affected: Leeds, 4,000 ; Bradford, 1,500 ; Keighley, 4,000 ; York,, 500 ; Hull, 500 ; Huddersfield, 500 ; Lincoln, 500 ; Halifax, 400. It can only be a question of time before all the engineering firms engaged in the production of castings are brought to a standstill. 0Impediments to Production.-Apart from the Railway Strike and the strike of the ironmoulders, the following factors are reported to be retarding the resettlement of labour in this Division : (1) Shortage of houses; (2) shortage of bricklayers ; (3) shortage of coal; (4) the retention of skilled men with the Colours ; (5) shortage of road-making materials.&apos;Restoration of Pre-War Practices Act.-lt is now anticipated that the Restoration of Pre-War Practices Act will be the cause of a considerable amount of trouble in the area. Three cases were dealt with during the week, and in one, the firm refused to discharge the women concerned except under an Order of Court.(cum) . &apos;-*--J-^. . 3 A
Northern.Unemployment-The live register for the week ending the 26th September records an increase of 315, made up of 211 men and 104 women. Engineering and ironfounding -continues to he one of the main groups in which unemployment is most serious. Ship-building is responsible for an increase in the numbers of unemployed on the North-East Coast, particularly on the Tyne and the Tees.General Effects of the Railway Strike. Large numbers of workpeople were thrown out of employment in different parts of the Division. The largest numbers are reported from the iron and steel districts. In many cases it will take some time before the blast furnaces can get into full swing again. The coal mines worked better than might have been ex-pected, some by virtue of having their own private lines and others by stacking coal. Shipyards and engineering works made strenuous efforts to keep going in spite of the non-delivery of material. The effect of this is likely to be reflected in a reduced demand for labour during the next few weeks.Effects of Ironmoulders&apos;&apos; Strike. The ironmoulders&apos; strike is largely accountable for the increase of unemployment in this Division.Tramway Workers&apos; Unrest. It is reported that the tramway settlement has not given satisfaction locally.New Developments in the Furnishing Trades. The strikers in the furnishing trade are reported to be seeking employment in the shipyards. It is understood that the Masters just before the strike, entered into a Working agreement with the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Association not to employ each others&apos; men in an industrial dispute.The Northumberland and Durham Furniture Trades Employers&apos; Association have now become federated to the National Federation.Shortage of Labour. Messrs. Head, Wrightson &amp; Co., General Engineers, Thornaby, report that their output is retarded by shortage of labour in the Smithing Department.Shortage of Material. Insufficient supplies of iron bars have reduced the output of rivets at Messrs. Gladstone Brothers, Stockton-on-Tees, to 75 tons per week, although their machines have capacity for 160 tons a week.Employment of Ex-Service Men. The live register records that a total of 1,097 disabled men have been unemployed fourteen or more days in this Division.Wales.Unemployment. Owing to the railway strike, no figures are available for the week ending the 26th September. It is reported that there is acute distress in the Dowlais area. A number of the men thrown out of employment by the closing of the Cyfarthfa Works are being absorbed into the mines, and the Local Authorities are employing as many of the others as possible on road-repairing.. General Effects of the Railway Strike-The railway strike brought the greater part of. the industry of the Division to a standstill. Several of the larger collieries, however,, managed to keep going by stacking coal.Effects of Ironfounders&apos; Strike. This strike does not appear to have as yet any appreci-able effect on works and labour not directly concerned. The stacks of castings are expected to last for at least another week.Impediments to Production. The following are reported as the chief impediments to -production in this division: (1) Shortage of railway wagons; (2) general shortage of housing accommodation ; (3) shortage of skilled labour, principally in the building trade, and (4) high cost of building materials.&apos; Employment of Ex-Service Men.-At Merthyr, &quot;undertakings &quot; to employ 25 men under the National Scheme have been received up to the 26th September. Cardiff City Treasurer has decided to reorganise his staff, so as to make room for at least 5 per cent, disabled men... Labour Situation in South Wales Coalfield-Tlie coalfield is particularly free from serious disputes at the present time. On the subject of nationalisation, Mr. Vernon Harts-horn states &quot; Those of us who know the intention of the Labour movement in relation to the matter and especially the determination of the Miners&apos; Federation, are concerned only as to the date when the Government will decide to nationalise.&quot; Mr. George Barker declares : &quot; Nationalisation has become inevitable if there is to he any peace in the coal. industry.&quot; The propaganda campaign in favour of nationalisation will open a few Weeks hence.  It is feared that extremists may utilise the occasion to urge more openly and boldly
than hitherto, the enforcement of the restriction of .o.utpnt policy, and thereby create an atmosphere strongly unfavourable to increased production.r, : Profit:Sharing Scheme. The Blaenavon Iron Company, Monmouthshire, propose to introduce a deposit and profit-sharing scheme for. their workmen. ,. , .,New Developments, Pembroke Dock Employment Committee is considering the. question of the adaptation of the dockyard to the building of merchant ships.  New works are contemplated in many districts throughout Wales and a large number of enquiries for factory sites are received by commercial agents; of the Welsh railways.Scotland.Unemployment. No figures showing the position on the live register have been received this week from this Division. The strike of the trawl fishermen has aggravated the. position at Aberdeen. The steel foundries have been unexpectedly disorganised through the strike of bricklayers. There is a great volume of work on hand,-and the effects of the stoppage will be felt in many quarters.General Effects of Railway Strike-ThQ shortage of material was making itself felt in large works by the time a settlement had been effected. In the Edinburgh area, the main trades concerned with unemployment consequent upon the strike were labourers, all classes of engineers at Rosyth, and miners. Miners were affected in the Dunfermline area and at Stirling. At Greenock about 600 people were out of employment, although the ship-building and engineering works were going on. 4,000 workers were affected at Coatbridge and 2,000 steel workers in the Johnstone area. The situation as regards the collieries has automaticallv been adjusted, but the steel foundries are still disorganised and the con-, gestion at the docks has not yet disappeared.The Formation of a Civic Guard. The Edinburgh Trades Council has passed a unanimous resolution protesting against the formation of a Civic Guard, on the ground that such a body would be provocative in character, and would compel the workers to form an organisation for their own defence. .;.Employment of Ex-Service Men.--Only six firms at Paisley have forwarded complete &quot; undertakings &quot; with reference to the National Scheme. Out of 282 employers notified at Dumfries only 14 have sent satisfactory replies up to date. The Dumbarton Com-mittee reports that although all employers in the area have been circulated only two &quot; undertakings &quot; have been received.. Glasgow Tramway Workers, The issue of the award of the Court of Arbitration to members of the Transport Workers&apos; Federation has created an anomalous position at Glasgow, where a number of tramway workers belong to the Municipal Employees&apos; Asso-ciation. The Corporation has not yet decided whether it will accept the decision of the Court. The United Vehicle Workers&apos; Union have stated that they are in honour bound to accept the present award, whereas the Municipal Employees&apos; Association are of the opinion thai they should abide by the decision on their own claim, the arbitration proceedings on which are expected to be held at an early date. When the relations of the Municipal Employees&apos; Association to certain other unions in the past are recalled, it will be realised that there might be material here for considerable trouble.New Border Trade Union. The woollen trade workers of Galashiels and other towns in the border area, numbering upwards of 5,000, have severed their connection with the Workers&apos; Union and have formed a distinct and independent organisation embracing hosiery and Woollen cloth workers., Associated Ironmoulders of Scotland. The decided expression of opinion given by the members of the.Associated Ironmoulders of Scotland through the recent ballot, against the recommendation of their Executive for a general strike, is said to be due to the failure of the Friendly Society of Ironfounders to assist the Scottish Society in the ironmoulders&apos; dispute in.Scotland in. 1917 and subsequent minor disputes. It Was affirmed in various quarters that the Executive of the Associated Ironmoulders was attempting to engineer a general dislocation of the Iron and Steel Founding Industries, and the result of the ballot is welcomed as a means of infusing a new spirit of conciliation and tolerance.:&apos; Nationalisation of Coal Mines and Wages Consolidation-It is, felt in some quarters that the attitude of the Government in connection with the reGent railway dispute, has greatly strengthened the decision on the question of nationalisation.. Wages consolidation bulks larger in the minds of the workers than the immediate nationalisation of industries, and in the engineering and cognate trades the next sitting of the Court of Arbitration is awaited with keen expectancy.   The Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Federation is(C 1901) 3 A 2
taking the lead in the movement for wages consolidation. The employers on the other hand, are strongly opposed to the demand, and it is understood that the Engineering and Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation have given directions that a further increase should be conceded rather than that the principle of the merging of the War wages should be accepted.Part VI.-Disputes. (a) Involving a Stoppage of Work.Building and Allied Trades.Joiners and. Carpenters, Southampton, A settlement of this strike was effected at the week end, when a joint conference was held, and the, men decided to accept the employers&apos; offer of arbitration and to return to work pending the result. The dispute,- which began on the 8th August, concerned a demand for an increase of wages.Asphalt Workers, London. The strike of asphalt workers, which affected about 500 workers in London and which has been in progress for several weeks, has been settled. The terms of settlement include a reduction of hours to 50f per week, &quot;layers &quot; to receive Is. 7d. per hour, labourers Is. id. per hour, and apprentices 2d. extra per hour.Bricklayers, Scotland. The strike of. bricklayers employed in Lanarkshire steel works (see Report for the 8th October, p. 316) threatens to bring about a complete deadlock in the steel industry of Scotland. Such a general stoppage would affect between 30,000 and 40,000 workers.Mining and Quarrying.Coal Miners, South Wales. It is reported that about 700 miners and their families are affected by the closing of the Maerdy Colliery by the Gwauncaegurwen Colliery Company. This pit was closed owing to the men&apos;s refusal to give up working under the &quot; Mabon &quot; wages agreement. The Company state that they cannot continue working the pit under this arrangement except at a loss.Metal, Engineering and Shipbuilding.Ironfounders.-A provisional settlement of the Ironfounders&apos; dispute (see Reports for the 24th September, 1st October, and 8th October) was arranged at a joint conference held in London last Saturday. As further negotiations will take place the terms of the agreement may be stated in detail.(1) Subject to the provisions of this memorandum, the present rates of wages shall continue in operation until September, 1920.(2) A conference shall be held within seven days after the resumption of work for the purpose of continuing the discussion in connection with the questions arising out of the intro-duction of the 47-hour week, with the view, inter alia, to fixing minimum standard rates for the various districts.(3) The present application for a general advance to be adjourned, without prejudice to either party, until after the decision of the Court of Arbitration on the next periodical hearing, when it will be considered on its merits and in view of the special arguments advanced. A conference for this purpose to be held within seven days of the announcement of the Court of Arbitration.(4) Subsequent general changes in wages shall be dealt with on a national basis in accord-ance with provisions for avoiding disputes to be mutually agreed upon.(5) There shall be no victimisation on either side.(6) The men&apos;s representatives undertake to submit these proposals to their members, and if they are accepted to give notice to the Employers&apos; Federations so as to permit of a general xesumption of work on Monday next.(7) The negotiations shall be conducted on behalf of the workpeople concerned by a joint committee representing the three unions.A national conference of delegates from the three Trade Unions concerned in the dispute was held in Manchester on the 14th inst., at which it was decided to reject the terms suggested by the Executives. A ballot of all members will be taken during the week and in the meantime the strike will continue.Steel Workers, South Wales. Some steps towards bringing about a settlement of the long-continued skilled steelworkers&apos; strike at Dowlais Ehbw Vale and Tredegar Steel Works were taken during the week. Meetings were held by both parties separately and the Joint Negotiating &apos;Committee met at Cardiff on the 13th inst., but no fresh offer has so far been made to the Strike Committee by the employers, so that the situation remains substantially the same. The men lately offered to accept  4 12s. Gd. a week if the employers would agree to submit the demand for the  5 flat rate to arbitration and the employers in turn offered  4 3s. Sd., and the abandonment by the men of the cheap coal privilege which has been in force for nearly a century. There is evidence that local public opinion is hardening against the strikers, whose action has produced .a very considerable amount of unemployment.  (See Part V.)
Jewellery, Trade. &apos;. Birmingham.-The strike over a refusal pn tie part of the Master Jewellers to recognise the National Union of Gold, Silver and Allied Trades which began on the 3rd inst., has now been settled.Woodworking.Furniture Trade Lock-Out-The lock-out of furniture trade workers at High Wycombe shows no signs of settlement. It is stated that the situation has been aggravated by the formulation of a new set of &quot;improved working conditions&quot; as put forward by the Trade Union. These provide for the total abolition of piecework ; a general minimum of Is. 9d. per hour for journeymen over 18 years of age employed upon skilled processes ; an hourly rate for all women over 18 years of age employed on skilled processes of not less than Is. Zd. an hour, a five-day working week ; overtime rates-time and a half the first two hours and double time, afterwards, Saturdays and Sundays and all holidays to be paid for at double time rates. The &apos; employers resist these new conditions and therefore the lock-out which has already lasted for eleven weeks will continue. A settlement of the dispute in the Swansea district was reached last week and the men resumed work on Friday, the 10th inst.Miscellaneous.Hairdressers, Glasgow. The wages dispute among hairdressers employed in the central district of Glasgow shows no prospect of immediate settlement. The men have been on strike for over a week to enforce their demand for an advance of 10s. a week, to be retrospective from the 1st May. The masters offered an immediate advance of 5s. a week, the other details to be submitted to arbitration.  This offer was, however, refused by the men.(b) Not Involving a Stoppage of Work.Building and Allied Trades.... The dispute in the Building Trade between the North-Western Employers&apos; Federation and the North-Western Building Trade Operatives federation has become somewhat serious during the last week. The masters refuse to grant the demand of the operatives for a general increase of 4rf..per hour, and the matter was referred for decision to the National Conciliation Board. The hearing should have taken plaog in London on the 14th instant, but as a small percentage of the men actually struck, the masters are unwilling to negotiate until these return to work. The operatives, however, as they refused to recognise the strike as official, wished the arbitration to take place notwithstanding, and state that any further delay in arriving at a settlement will lead to more serious trouble.Metal, Engineering and Shipbuilding.Hollow Ware Trade. In consequence of the recent demand for an advance of 25 per cent, put forward by employers in the galvanised hollow ware trade in the Cradley Heath District, a ballot is now being, taken on terms offered by the employers. These include a 12 per cent, advance to day workers on the new standard rate of Is. 6d. per hour which will mean 8s. and 10s. per week advance to all day workers, piece-workers to have a 12^per cent, advance on the new list of prices. The men&apos;s union &quot;recommend them to accept the terms, but the result of the ballot is not yet known.       *      -       &apos;&apos; &apos;Textile Trades.       - ,  :    /Lace Curtain Operatives. Notices to strike have been handed in by Scottish and English operatives of the manufacturing sections, of the lace curtain trade. The employers have refused to concede the demand for a 40 per cent, advance, pending the arrangement of uniform price lists for workmen on both sides of the borders ; they offered a 25 per cent, advance which was refused by the union. The strike notices will take effect on the 18th instant, about 4,000 workpeople being involved.Calico Printers.Demands for an advance of 120 per cent, on their pre-war wages were made some time ago by operatives in the calico printing trade. The employers offered terms which were rejected by the men, who at the time also refused to submit the matter to arbitration. Since then, however, a baUot has been taken which has resulted in a substantial majority in favour of a settlement by arbitration.Mailwaymen.The negotiations on the standardisation of wages were resumed this week between the Executive of the National Union of Bailwaymen and the Government.
Printing and Allied Trades.It i$ understood that the Printing Trades&apos;Federation intends to make an application to the -   London Master Printers&apos;and Newspaper Proprietors&apos;Association for an all-round increase of 15s. per week, to meet the additional cost of living.Food, Drink and Tobacco. .   ,,D-airy Workers. In connection with recent demands by milk carriers and other dairy &apos;i workers in London for increased wages and better working conditions generally, a Conference &apos; was held on the 13th instant, between the London and Provincial Master Dairymen&apos;s Association and the National Union of Vehicle Workers and the Workers&apos; Union, the latter representing dairy employees in London.  It is stated in the Press that the Conference was very satisfactory, distinct progress being made towards a solution of the difficulties.Co-operative Employees. *A settlement has been reached in the dispute between the North-Western Hours and Wages Board and the employees, which arose over the interpretation by the Board of one of the clauses in the agreement arrived at after the strike last August. A Joint Conference was held at Manchester on the 11th inst., and another on the 14th, at which after considerable discussion it was decided to refer the matter to arbitration.Stable Lads.A strike of the stable lads employed at Epsom, who are members of the National Union of General Workers, will take place on the 18th instant, unless their demands, which include a weekly minimum wage of 50s., are granted before that time. A meeting of the Trainers&apos;Federa-tion is to be held between now and that date, when it is possible some settlement will be reached.Teachers.A special unofficial convention of teachers to discuss strike policy was held at Birmingham last week. Delegates from all parts of the country attended, and about 40,000 teachers were represented in all. The meeting adopted a resolution directing the executive of the National Union of Teachers to insist on the carrying out of the report of the Joint Standing Committee on a provisional minimum scale, and carry-over being submitted to a specially convened con-ference within one month of the drawing up of the^ report.K S.
