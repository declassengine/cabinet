Clomenoeau and yourself on the subject of tho military occupation of Syria, Palestine and Mesopotamia ponding the deoislon of tho Peace. Confercnoe in regard to mandates, copies of which have also been communioated to-Mr, Polk, representing the United States of America, and Signer Tittoni, representing the Kingdom of Italy.,Aa your Highness would appear to be under a mio-apprehenoion as to the character of the aide-memoire I should like at the outset to make it clear that the said document in no sense represents an agreement between the French and British Government a.     It contains proposals put forward by the British Government on its own initiative for the military occupation of the cx-Turkish territories, . pending a final settlement as to their future by the Peaoe Conference.     These proposals - to which they adhere -i worked out by the British Government as soon as theyhad decided that it was impossible for them to continue the occupation of Syria by British troops.     They invited you to come to Europe, and made instant arrangements for your transportation before ever they were communicated to the French Government or the Conference,, and they wor&quot; plaoed in your hands for your consideration directly you arrived.Your Highness would appear to regard tho proposed arrangement for the relief of British troops by French and Arab foroas as being in some way contrary to the obligations entered into by His Majesty!.s Government with your illustrious father, Kis Highness Sherif Hussein,
King of the nnuja?;.     in order that there may he no -misunderstanding on this point, I append tho oorretspondenoebot^oen your illustrious father, King of tho Hodjas, and   -His Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner at Cairo &quot;hich contains the conditions upon which tho Arabs entered the war against Turkey,     The seri.ee contains the whole corresponddenoe on the subject in the possession of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment,   The document which Year Highness handed to &apos; ,hcPrime Minister at our Conference a faw days ago is only asummary of conditions at one time desired by King Hussein, butnever at any tima entertained and still loss accepted by them-It has, therefore, no bearing on tha question under discussion.From the annexed correspondence. it will bo apparentto Your Highness that His Majesty1s Government made it clear from the outset that, in their opihion, &quot;the districts ofMersina and Alexandretta and portions of Syria lying to theWest of the districts of Damascus, Hama, Horns and Aleppo, cannotbe said to be purely Arab and should bo excluded from, theproposed limits and boundaries within which they were preparedto recognise the independence of the Arabs, and in which great Britain is free to act without detriment to the interestsof her Ally, Francp&apos;V   These quotations are from a letter,dated October 25th, 1915 from Sir Henry McMahon to His HighnessShorif H useein.    On the 5th November, His Highness SherifHussein replied to this letter stating that he renounced his in-sistence on the inclusion of the Vilayets of Mersina and Adanain the Arab Kingdom, but&amp;oglared that the provinces of Aleppo and Boyrut and their sea feo&amp;sts were purely Arab provinces. To this letter His Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner in Cairo replieden the 14th December welcoming His Hignesc&apos;s agreement to&apos;exclude tho Vilayets of Mersina and Adana from the boundaries ofthe Arab territories.-.   He wont on, however; to say that&quot; j  , .with regard to the Vilayets of Aloppc and Beyrut the Government of Great Britain have taken careful not.ice of your observations, but as the interests of our A-.ly, France are involved the question will require careful consideration and a further communication on tho subject will be addressed to you in due course,&quot;The nece?suty for this? further communication, however, wat obviated by a reply from Hib Highaxes Sherif Husnein, dated 1st January, 1916 in which Hia Highness wrote as follows&quot;An regard&quot; the Northern parts and their coasts, wo havo already rtated in our previous letter, what ere the utmoa pssnible modifications, and all thir wa^ only done so an to fulfil thone aspiration^ who^e attainment was denired by the will of the bl-bsned and supreme God.    It was
this -3..4ne feeling and desire which impelled us to avoid ^hat posiibly &apos;njure the Alliance between Great Britain and Prance und the ,agreement made them during the present w-.,r and calamities3 -yet, we find it our duty that the eminent Minister should be sure that -at the first opportunity after this war is finished we should ask you (what w;e avert our eyes from to-day) for what &apos;-e now . leave to France in Beyrut and its coasts&quot;.His Highness went onto express the opinion that 5-&quot;The people of Beyrut would decidedly never accept-such isolations, and they may oblige us to undertake new measures which might exercise Great Britain certain]y not less than.our present troubles, because of our belidf and uncertainty in the reciprocity of our interests which was the only cause that caused-us never to negotiate with any other power but you.   Consequently it is impossible to allow any derogation which gives France or any other power a span of land in those regions&quot;.On the 25th of January His Majesty5s High commissioner at Cairo replied that?- :-as regards the Northern parts, we note with s*at 12-faction your desire to avoid anything which, mighg possibly injure the Alliance of Great Britain end France,   It is, &apos; &apos; as you know, our fixed determination that nothing shall be permitted to interfere in the slightest degree with our united prosecution of the war to a victorious conclusions Moreover, when the victory had been won, the friendship of Great Britain and FrA-nce will become, yet more firm and enduring, cemented by the blood of&apos; Englishmen, and Frenchmen -who had died side by side fighting for the cause of right and liberty/1This wps the last communication which passed on this subject ,before the combined operations began which terminated in november 1918 in the total defeat of the Turkish forcescFrom this correspondence two things are clear.   First, that the British Government are bound by their undertakings to King Hussein to recognise the establishment of an independent Arab- State comprising within its borders the four towns of Damascus, Hama, Horns and Aleppo; and second, that they made it absolutely clear to your illustrious father before the entry of th- Arabs into the war that they regarded France as- having special,rights, in the area \&quot;est of these, four towns--  His Majesty!s&apos;.Government would&apos;further pointout that in 1916 &apos;-aen for the.purposes of the Common campaign it became necessary to arrive.at.an agreement with France and Russia as to the. occupation of Turkish territories in the event ofthe downfall of Turkey, His -Majesty&apos;1 s Government insisted on reserving the independence of the Arabs in the districts which they had promised to reserve to them in their correspondence *ith King Hussein.   They did not communicate this agreement to
Jung Hussein because it was in complete conformity with the undertakings they had already entered into with him.The attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government, therefore, throughout the^e negotiations has been entirely consistent and clear.     They haV;entered into obligations to both their Allies, to the French and to the Arabs.      These obligations do not conflict but are complementary to one another.     His Majesty&apos;s Government attach the greatest importance to the friendship and co-operation of both their Allies and it is their intention to live up to their undertakings to each.I come now to Your Highness1s query as to why it is neces-sary for the British occupation of Syria to be brought to an end immediately Instead of being prolonged till the conclusion of peaco with Turkey.   Tha reason is to be found in the tremendous effort put forward by tho British Empire in the war against luekey and its Allies.   His Majesty1s Government recognise gladly and fully the indispensable assistance rendered to the Allied caase by King Hussein and yourself,- and by the valiant Arab troops under your command.   The courage and activity of Your Highnessrs troops were an essential element in the campaign which led to the over-throw of Turkish despotism.   But His Majesty^ Government cannot forget taat infinitely the larger share of the burden of the defeat of Turkey was carried by th -British Em-ire.     lorn first i-o last they sent to the Eastern theatre of war a tOitfcl, of over 1,400,000 troops at a cost exceeding  &quot;750,000,000.     These burdens were additional to the far greater sacrifices which they were compelled to ma&amp;e in Europe in order to secure the over-throw of the German-power which lay behind tho Turkish Smpire0 The peoples of the British Empire have lost over 950,000 lives, and they have incurred a debt of  9,000,000,000 in seouring the freedom of tho nations of Europe and of the peoples who formerl languished under the Turkish yoke.   It was at this cost that the peoples of the British Empire assisted the Arab peoples,-and the oppressed nationalities of Europe, to throw off tho yo&amp;e of the oppressor and to make a start on the highroad to prosperity,independence and influence in the world.In addition, however, to its efforts mado during
the war the British Empire h..s waixrt i:acd garrisons throughoutthe occupied territories for a year from the signature of theArmistice.     It h;.s sustained the onerous and expensive burdenof maintaining law and order in countries just liberated fromalien rule in the hopes that the Pe.ce Conference would come toa rapid and peaceful solution of the difficult problems ccn-nected with the future of the Middle East.     But it is turf air to the British taxpayer to i-.sk him to bear any longer the burdenof occupying provinces for which tho Umpire does not propose toaccept permanent recponoibility.     As long ago as March lastHis Majesty1 s Government made a formal declaration to the PeaceConference and to yourself th.&apos;-.t in no eiacunist: wees would itundertake a mandate for Syr is.    There is now, owing to the&apos;delay of the United St;tes of America in deciding whether or not it is prepared to take a hand in safeguarding the well-being and progress of the people a of the Middle East, no prospect of any final peace being made with Turkey until well on into next year.In these circumstances His Iife.jestyrs Government have decided thatit is impossible for them to maintain their troops any longer in syria and they have notified the Conference accordingly thatthey propose to withdraw them on November 1st. 1919.In an additional note dated September  3rd. Your Highnessraises the question of the conditions upon which the coast townswere evacuated by the Arab forces during the advance.     His MajestiesGovernment is loth to think that Your Highness considers that youcomplied with the orders of the flom.Tiandpr-in-Chief under whosocommand you were - orders which he had ample strength to enforce -as the result of a bargain.     That Your Highness understood thatthe British occupation would last until the final conclusion ofpeace I can readily understand since that view was shared by HisMajesty^ Government at that time.   His M&quot; jesty^s Government haveprolonged the British occupation f,.r longer than they or anyone else aver contemplated as ;v--obable, but in view of the over-whelming burden which rests upon them it is certainly within their rights to insist that that occupation must be brought to an end.In making the aforementioned notification to the Peace Conference of their intention to withdraw theirr   troo-ps
troops forthwith, His Majesty&apos;s Government also submitted the proposal for the interim occupation of the ex-Turkish territories contained in the side-memoire. They do not see that any other proposal is practicable for the interim period. There is no authority of weight who believes that the people of Syria can stand alone at the present time. To attempt this solution, which you suggest, would simply be to prejudice the free and rapid progress and ultimately the independence of the Syrian and Arab peoples. Further, it is essential that until the peace is made with Turkey, some first class European power should hold the territory to the South East of Anatolia. In submitting their proposal asset forth in the aide-memoire His Majesty&apos;s Government have scrupulously regarded the obligation they have incurred to both their Allies, to the Arabs and to the French, obligations which, as already explained were made clear to King Hussein before ever he entered the war. They have, not without difficulty, secured to Your Highness the establishment of an independent Arab State in that part if Syria, including ?, Hama, Ho?, and Aleppo promised to the Arabs in the correspondence with King Hussein.

In so far as the occupation by France of the rest of Syria is concerned, they would ask Your Highness to remember that the Arabs owe their freedom in a large measure to the supreme sacrifices made by the French people in the late war. It is true that the French contribution in Syria itself was not great for France was deeply re-occupied in the war on other fronts. But on those greater and vital battlefields of Europe they lost 1,400,000 in dead, and incurred a debt not far short of that incurred by Great Britain in overthrowing the power which ? the tyranny and without whose support the Turkish military power could not have continued the war more than a few weeks.

His Majesty&apos;s Government, therefore, earnestly trust that you will agree to the proposals for the occupation of Syria made



    
made in the i:ide-m,-L.oiro for tho interim period up to ths conclusion-oi posoe with (Turkey.    Thy considerations you rsiso a a to the future of the Syrian snO I, rah people will probably be urged at tho Peece Conference itself of which you are yourself c distinguished member, and which will ha\q complete power to,deal with the whole Arab question, and which will have to take into account not only your own views and those of the Arab people, but the various under-takings end declarations of tho Groat Powers.Hi3 Lajeaty&apos;6 Government have not the slightest doubfe. that the best course for the Arab people is to accept the temporary arrangement proposed and to;enter into friendly working arrangements for its execution  $ h their Allies, Great Britain and France.    As previously suggested they strongly urge that Your Highness should discuss these arrangements at once with the French Government. .  His Kajestyis Government will bo only too glad to do all in their power to promote a cordial and satisfactory understanding between their two Allies in regard to the occupation during the interim period.     They would, however, be failing in their duty to their Arab Ally if they did not declare in tho most earnest as well as in tho most friendly manner that they can conceive of no policy more fatal to Arab aspirations and pros-parity both at the forthcoming Peace Conference and afterwards then the method of military resistance hinted at in Youf Highnesses letter.    As the sincere friend and well-wisher of tho Arab people Gr^at Britain invites thorn to accept the erran-goment proposed.     I further trust that this, letter will help to render profitable the further-conversations with Your Eigh.-neas to which I look forward with pleasure and,in which J trust a moans will be found to affect&apos;a-complete reconciliation of the relations between this country and its French and Arab Allies.
I bog Your Highness to bolieTo that tho Britlah Government ere cc taunted by tho a ono nymeethy with and admiration for the  rob nation v/hich prompted them to support Hio Highness  horix Huscsin in hia revolt against the Turks, and which characterised tho entire course of their relations with Your Highncao in the glorious and triumphant struggle in which with tho co-operation of lour Highness they have ao long been engaged.-8-
