The area of land administered by the Board remains the same as that mentioned in last week 1a report;   namely 18,643 acres.The scheme at Kinaon, near Bournemouth, referred to in last week&apos;a report has now been further discussed with the Ministry of Health in accordance with the Treasury request, and it,has been agreed that the Treasury should be asked to. sanction the scheme as an experiment under the direction of the Board of Agriculture.     The scheme will not be taken as a precedent in connection with the other Tuberculous Colonies, aa it is understood the Ministry of Health agree that soldiers and sailors discharged from the Forces aa tuberculous, who, by reason of their ailment, require a home in the country, should be dealt with, not under the Land Settlement Scheme, but by the Ministry of Health under the general arrangements for the aftercare of tuberculous ex-Service men.     With a view to meeting the objection to providing permanent buildings in connection with an experimental scheme, a.revised estimate of the cost of equipment is being submitted to the Treasury, based on the provision of eleven &quot;hut-dwellings&quot;, instead, of permanent cottages.     Thia will effect an immediate saving of about  3,300.The total number of ex-Service men now on the Farm Settlements ia 340, oonsiating ..of 164 settlers, 116 probationers, and 60 other ex-Service men working as: wage-earners.     In additisn there are at the Settlement at -Vantage ten ex-Land Army women.

Services :?und, which has, as one of its special objects, the provision of Club Rooms.for ex-Service men, Up to the present time no decision how been obtained, although it ia urgently necessary that such Clubs should be provided before the coming winter.
The weekly reports received from the Directors show that at ^trin^ton harvest is now finished, and threshing has commenced, A number&quot;7f&quot;civilians who are not ex-Service men are still employed at this Settlement, and the Director has given notice to seven of these, in order that &quot;heir places may bo taken by ex-Service men. This will leave as regular workers- three civilian foremen, three civilian labourers, a wheelwright and a blacksmith, all of whom will be replaced by ex-Gervice men as soon as sufficiently   : skilled men can be obtained.     All the remaining civilians are horse-lads or casual men, and these v/ill be dispensed with, as soon as possiblesAt HclbA^aphi,  3 of the probationers have received holdings as from the 11th inst..^ bringing tho total number of settlers -with land, at this Settlement up to &quot;61.

The huts at Pembr ey-are^ now ready for occupation, and it is hoped totake...additional ex-Service men at once.     The work of fencing at this Settlement is -being pushed forward.The Rolieston the whole of the harvest is now-gathered in good condition,     Steam Tackle has ploughed over 109 acres of stubbles and about 70 acres of wheat have been sown.     A Motor Lorry has been pur-chased and despatched to this Settlement during the week.     At BpBburv three ex-Cfficers have taken up their holdings,     4&apos;-? acres have been ploughed on the Central Farm.     A Ford Van has been despatched to this Settlement during, the week to be used for the transport of the produce both of the Central Farm -and of the settlers&apos; holdings.     80 acres of wheat have been sown at Ames bury -luring the weed: under perfect conditions.     The winter oats are now corning through.&apos;    An additional 100 tons of potatoes have been sold at  3,  10. 0. per ton,     Two further probationers have arrived at Berwick SWdffamea during the week;    21 acres of barley and 20 acres of vetches have been sown,At Wantage the main work has been drilling, and 51 acres-of wheat have now been sown.     Arrangements have been made for a part of the land and buildings, including the poultry houses, at Titchfield   to be devoted to the training of disabled ex-Service men in poultry-keeping.     The ideal weather has enabled the new smallholders to make good headway in the cleaning of their plots. The number of ex-Service men who have holdings at this Settlement is now 61, including 21 of the former smallholders who are ex-Serylue men.(11)   work of A.h.0/3.Determination of Tenancies,     In February, 1918, the Board authorised the Cheshire A,ihC. to take possession under Regulation 2ii of 9 acres of accommodation land occupied by a butcher.     The land at that time was in a very foul state.     Part of the land was let by the Committee to -the Chester city Council and the Boughton Parish Council for allotments   and the remainder to a neighbouring farmer.     The Landlord is now /ailing to accept the Committee&apos;s tenants, and in order to enable him to make the necessary tenancy agreements, the Poard have issued an Order determining forthwith the tenancy of the butcher who occupied the land previous to the hoard!s ehtrv.
Application has boon mada to the Board by the Cumberland A.7P..C. for an Order determining tlw tenancy of a holding of 53 aoroo . This-farm has bean under observation for tho last 18 months, and there has b-jen gross neglect on tho part of the tenant.    The corn gathered in 1918 was of no value;    ono aoro of corn was graced by snoop until Hidsummor, and at harvest, cattle and poultry &quot;/ero turned into tho field.     Tho c:.-rn crop this year is no bettor, and is foul v&apos;ith thistles and. annual woods.     Half an acre of potatoes has boon ploughed in, and the rest of the field is a mass of thistles.     Th-- stock is allowed to stray cvor the Holding, and tho fences, ditches and culverts havo boon neglected.     As there is no agreement of tenancy, the tenant -would be entitled in tho ordinary courbo to remain until Lady Bay 1021 *     Tho Board have, tb r-fore, issued an Order determining tho tenancy at Lady Day 1920, on which date arrangements havo boon mado to i*t tho land to a new tenant,(iii)   Prevision of Land for Allotments,Tlr* owner of a certain piece of vacant building land, la.2r.15p. in extent, of which possession had been taken by the Primley (Surrey) U.D.C under the Cultivation of Lands Order and lot by them in 28 allotments, stipulated for a rental of -32S per annum for tho period of tho Board&apos;s retention cf the land under Section 1 of tho Defence of tho Realm (Acquisition of Land) Act, 1916.-,     It was explained to tho owner by tho Council that, under the Act of 1916, the compensation in the nature of rent payable in respect of such land v,as detcrminablo upon the basis of the value of the land for agricultural purposes at the date of tho notice to treat if it had remained in the condition in which it was at the time of the Council&apos;o entry, and that tho Council had boon accustomed to paying rent at the rate of  3 per ex re for similar land in tho District for allotments prior to the war. As tho owner declined to reduce his terms the Board   -intimated that tho matter must go to arbitration under the Corn Production Acts, 1917 to 1918.      This intimation has bad a good effect as the owner has now stated that ho docs not desire to go to arbitration, and that, failing any better offer, he will be prepared to accept rent at the rate of  3 pcracro per annum, subject to an undertaking being given that possession of the land would bo givan immediately if required for building or other special purposes.     Tho Board have advised %ho Council to enter into an agreement with tho owner accordingly-.( iv)   Ban cl Dr a i r.1 ag o .River Ouso.

owners or occupiers ef land;   and there appears to have &quot;been a personal canvass against the Beard&apos;a proposals.    The public enquiry into the objections will be held at Cambridge commencing on Monday the 20th inst.Other Orderb under Land Drainage Act, 1916*   Tho following progress has been made with orders umer the Land Drainage Act, 1918:-    Meathop and Withers! a ok Drainage Distriqft, Westmorland (new drainage district); &apos; draft order deposited,&apos;  B^ejf^glrket Drainage District,     Cheshire (new drainage districtj; order confirmed.   fraJcenheaflfr and jBrandon Cpnmisj^oner-s.

Tithe, Commons, Copyhold and Survey.Dhe following statement shows the number of redemption applications received during the last week and the amount of tithe renteharge included therein, together with comparative figures for previous years:-2nd week in     Mumbor of  Applications    Amount of Tithe Rent-October, received. charge included insuoh applications.  .   s.   d.1913.	2.	3.	19.	9.1914.	3.		13.	11.1915.	3.	5.	16.	3.1916.	2.	18.	18.	0.1917.	1.		4.	6.1918.	5.	3.	7.	4.1919.	57.	827.	14.	6.The number of applications exceed that for  any week in any previous year though the amount of tho tithe rentoharge ( 827.14.6) falls below the record figure whioh wa3 reached last week .( 1091).In calculating the compensation for the redemption of tithe rentcharge in accordance with the first Schedule to the Tithe Act, 1918, the Board are required to make certain deductions from the &quot;gross annual value&quot; of the tithe rentchargo.   One of the deductions to be so made is the average amount paid or payable by the tithe owner in respect of tho tithe rentcharge for the three years immediately preceding the date of application to redeem, on   -account of rates.   In view of the general&quot; increase of rates throughout the Country and the increased amounts at which tithe rentcharge is being assessed by the   Rating Authorities, the deduction to be made for rates in the case of applications for redemption received next year will cause a material reduction in the amount of the consideration money payable for redemption.   In one case which has been brought to the board&apos;s notioe in Durrington, Wilts, the consideration money payable on an application for redemption made this year would be  949&quot;as compared with  904 if the application were postponed until next year.The Godstone Urban District Council have applied for the Board1s consent to the continued occupation of part of LimpsfieId Common by Army Huts, which are to be adapted as i dwelling houses pending the completion of the Councils housing scheme.&quot; The Board are in communication with the Ministry of Health in the matter.

to the United Kingdom was obtained for the present quarter.   Tho normal supply for&quot; the current three month.:; itf about 60,000 tons so that this is an increase of 50 per cent.   In addition the lirench Authorities indicated that they expected to bo ablo to authorise the export of .3130,006 tons in 1920, whioh are the full estimated requirements of the United kingdom fron licrth Africa. It was pointed out,, however, that the supply of rock was moro or less dependent on the provision of a sufficient supply of coal for the ur.e of the &quot;Minos and for the railways transporting the rook to tho coast,, and an undertaking Was accordingly given that the Board would press the Coal Controller for an additional allocation.of coal to meet to some extent tho heeds ox phosphate producers in North Africa^Basic Slag. The deliveries of Basic Slag in tho first four months of  &amp;e present fertiliser year amount to 144,000 tons as   . Compared with 177,000 tons in tho same period last season.   This decrease ia mainly due to two works being closed down, one owing to a fire and one for the installation of new plant, etc., while labour difficulties have tended to reduce the output elsewhere-It is hoped, however, that from now onwards the production will improve,Lime.   The production of ground chalk at the uorks at Coul3don which were erected by thus Department is showing a satisfactory increase.; The output at the present time is at the rate of about 1,000 tons per month.    The firm working this plant is so satisfied with the results obtained that it proposes to purchase it from the.,..&apos; Department in accordance with the arrangements made in the original agreement.   A somewhat similar plant -which has been erected at Steneycombe in Devonshire, is aiso working   uatisfactorily and the demand in the district is steadily increasing.   Some few months ago considerable difficulty was experienced in disposing of the output.Transport, practically no complaints have been received with ., regard to tho fruit and. vegetable traffic and the strike Ooes not seem to have aerioualy affected supplies to and from the London marke ts.Fertilisers and Feeding stuffs Act. The Local Authority for Devon have raised the question of instituting proceedings under this Act, against two sellers of Basic slag in which the phosphates were below the amount guaranteed; and the Western Counties Basic Slag Company were fined 3 guineas and costs at the Llandilo Petty Sessions last month in respect of a sample of Basic Slag&apos;.Mere-handise Harks Act. The Ministry of Health hao referred to the Board draft Regulations in regard to the sale and marking of condensed milk.   It is proposed to recommend that the label shall indicate the quantity of whole milk of the. legal standard which will be produced, by adding the contents of tho. tin to a definite quantity of water.   The effect of thi;, will be to inform the purchaser of the quantity of milk comparable to fresh mil;-; which he is actually obtaining when buying condensed milk,Seeds and weeds Bill,, A draft of the Bill incorporating the various amendments-suggested up to date from official and trade   &apos; sourco3, so far as these amendments ore considered practicable, was discussed   on the 14th inst,-, at a meeting of the trade members of the seeds Advisory Committees,- and a Conference on the Bill, -to which representatives of all the interests concerned are being invited, is being called for the&apos;24th Iii at.

Although the Department arranged that the Tractor Scheme&apos; should close on the 30th September, in a few cases where,owing to the railway strike,there was a coal shortage, the use of tractors for a short time after that date has been authorise In the Holland Division of Lincolnshire authority was given to use a Clayton tractor for pumping:;    in Carmarthen where a large amount of heated corn was spoiling, the use of tractors to drive threshing machines was authorised,     In neither case will the arrangement interfere with the sale of the machines, which will take place as previously arranged..In only three Counties has there been difficulty in terminating the scheme at the end of September:   in two Counties the requisite mo nth1s notice to contractors was not given by the Committees until the middle of September, while in Anglesey the Committee, owing to adverse circumstances, found themselves at the end of the month with a few contracts uncompleted and had to continue work for a few days.Organisation of Threshing:    Replies to the Board&apos;s circular of the 4th September, No. 356/1,1,6..,. have now been received from about one third of the Committees, who without exception, state
that they do not consider it neoessary this season to reconstitute a Threshing Sub^Conraittee.    Committees will arrange that stacks of the smaller farmers and on farms in outlying districts shall be duly thresh 3d, and one or tw6 are endeavouring to arrange prices with the threshing proprietors.Htrse Section^   The tctal number of hiroee sold to date is 8234.   The total amount realised is  499,408 making an average of  61.Education Branoh.Higher Agricultural Education.&quot;Advisory&quot; Grants.     At a conference with the Socretary on the 10th inst. the reconstruction of the &quot;Advisory&quot; Scheme of Grants was considered.    These grants provide at present for the salaries and expenses of some 1? officers stationed at various Provincial Colleges.    These officers are primarily engaged in advisory and investigational work but in some oases are also employed in teaching.     It was decided to previde one entomologist and one mycologist at each of the provincial centres, thus increasing the number of possible posts to 31 and te&apos;limit severely tho amount?&apos;-&apos;&apos;of teaching to be done Xy these cf fleers. The estimated ultimate cost of the new scheme is  24,000 ai against  12,000,the amount originally provided by the Devflopment . Cemmissienere when the scheme was established in 1911.&quot;Maintenance&quot; Grants.   Treasury sanction hat new been received For the payment   of increased &quot;bledc&quot; grants tt* agricultural colleges in respect of the academio year 1918*^*. In most cases the new grants show an increase cf approximately bO% over the grants made before the war, and it has been intimated to the Colleges that the increase should he devoted primarily to raising the salaries of members of the staff.Re search.    An application has been received from the University College of Tales, Aberystwyth, for a grant of  1,400 towards the establishment of a plant Breeding Station.    The scheme ewes its inception to the generosity of Mr. Lauronee philipps, of Boughrood, Radnorshire, who has provided a capital sum of  10,000 and an annual gift of  1,000 for ten years.    Jot the current year the annual expenditure is expected to amount to  2,300, towards which  1,500 will be available, from the endowment fund, and the Board are askod to provide the balane^ pt  800, together with a capital grant of  600 towards,the tost of preliminary greenhouses, &amp;c&apos;.    It is expected, htwevor, that the station will expand considerably, necessitating increased grants if the scheme is approved.County Agricultural ilduoati*n.   Approval has been given to a    , scheme submitted by the iiWi&apos; Sussex County Council, under . which the Agricultural Education Committee will lease for 5 years a farm of 353 acres and run it as a demonstration farm.    It is not expected that&apos;the working of the farm will involve financial loss, but the Board have intimated their willingness to pay 2/3rd8 cf any deficit as shown by a trading account, including payment of interest and sinking fund charges on the capital j expenditure required for stocking and &apos;.c?.&quot;&apos;equipping   the farm, up to a maximum of  6,500.The Cheshire County Council have completed the purchase of Reaseheath Estate, Nantwich (258 acres), for the purpose of a tfarm Institute, the board approval having been given a short time ago.     The Council will obtain possession in the spring of next year, and are at present considering the question of the adaptation of the estate for educational purposes as a part of the general scheme of agricultural education in the County.
Consideration has been given tc the position of Agricultural Organisers who have &quot;been employed during the war cn the duties of Agricultural JJbcecutivc Committees.     It is felt that the time has now come when each County should have an Agricultural Organiser wholly engaged in the duties attaching to his pist, and in cases where the &quot;dual&quot; arrangement is in force, it is being intimated to the respective Committees that tho arrangement must be terminated at an early date.Encouragement of rCheesemaking,,Scheme.    Owing to the open Autumn and&quot;a flusn of ^&amp;^&apos;msaiy* 6TmVi^ ohMsemkiTig claesee have been continued longer than was anticipated.     It is probable that several will not conclude before the    end of the month.All the reports on tho travelling cheese schools continue to be satisfactory, and, in respeot of the co-operative cheese schools, it would appear that at practically thewhol&amp; of the centres where classes have been conducted registered co-cperative Societies have either been or aro being formed for the purpose of conducting co-operative milk depots.Since the introduction cf co-operative cheese schools it is estimated that over 40 co-operative Dairy Societies have resulted either directly or indirectly therefrom.Arable Dairy farming Demonstrations.-   Six of the 10 centres have now been definitely settled&quot;, namely:   Cornwall, where land has been bought at Resparveth;   Wilts, where the Small Holdings Committee have agreed to sell to the Board&quot;a portion of the Rowde Estate near Devizes;   Middlesex, where the Small Holdings Committee have agreed to lease to the Board one of the Small Holdings on the Donliam Estate near Uxbridge;   Notts., where the Board have purchased land near Hucknall from a private owner; Durham, where the Board are purchasing the neoessary land near Blaydon-on-Tyne from the local Colliery Company;   Warwickshire, , where the Board are leasing from the Birmingham Corporation a Small Holding on their Canwell Estate near Sutton Coldfield, Negotiations are in a very forward state for a seventh centre, namely near Kettering, Northamptonshire, where the small holdings Committee are prepared to lease to the Board an area of land from their Pytchley Ledge Estate,     The completion of these negotiations only awaits satisfactory evidence that sufficient water can be obtained on the Bite.     This only leaves one more centre to be arranged for England and in respeot of this the Branch is in very close :-touch with the Ministry of Munitions regarding the taking over of a portion of the land acquired by that Department for a Munition  actcry at Heref crdOcwith the Somerset Small Holdings Committee.With regard to the two centres for Wales, se-veral inspections have been made both in South and North Wales si roe the last report was made but so far the Board have not been able to obtain a really suitable offer.The sowing of Autumn Crops is being seriously held up &quot;by the delay of the seed on the railways.     tfor example, seed despatched on the 25th ult. has yet to reach its destination. We now have to resort to Motor transport.Evaporation of Whey.   There is a further advance in the. work which the Board have done in respect of the conservation of whey by drying;   and the Inspector in charge is now arranging to pay personal visits to the several Dairy Paotories v/herv-whor is being wasted with a view to advising the ma nan o men t c o nc e r n ed.
Seed Testing Station.The now pronrol.ec6-i^akjsn f rr the Seed Testing Station,. . at 18, Leigham Cvurfc Road, Streatl\v.n.:p:iJJ.&apos;, S.V/.1G, are ncW almost completely fitted up *     All samples which had aocuiaul-atod&quot;&quot; during the proooss of removal are now in test, and it is hoped that &quot;by the end of next week they will all ho reputed upon, A certain amount of delay was, under the circumstances unavoidable, but arrangements were made by which there was no delay in the tests of autumn sown cereals, reports m which were urgent.The house taken for the Station is very suitably arranged for the purpose.     The accommodation is considerably .j; -greater than at Victoria Street and the conditions are more favourable for this kind of work.     A certain amount of gardon space and greenhouse space is available.     This will enable the Station to compare the laboratory results with soil tests where desirable,,     It is hoped also that it will be possible tc work . up stocks of the commoner weed seeds for distribution since many requests have been received from the Trade for . specimen collections for identification purposes.Boxted (Tjssex)   Land Settlement Polony.A visit to the Sorted Land Settlement Colony was recently made by an officer of tho Board accompanied by the Principal and the Horticulturist of tho East Anglian Institute of Agriculture,     The visit was made in connection with tho laying out of an experimental field of about 8 acres , whioh the staff of the east Anglian Institute have been asked to manage for the benefit of the settlers ,The soil is fine clayey sand about 6 inches deep overlying greyish brown clay, andis typical of tho soil of the settlement generally.     The field has boon badly farmed for some years and is considered unsuitable for agricultural purposes.The main difficulties are presented by weeds, deficient drainage, lack of lime and general poverty.     In winter, owing to the close texture of the soil tho land is water-legged, and is difficult to work in season,The experiments will include drainage (by mole plough) subsoiling, liming and manuring and a&apos;variety of vegetable crops wJLll be grown.Light Railway in Us sex,The district to be tapped by a proposed light railway running N.N.J3. from Southainster to Bradwell in Essex, a distance of about 6 miles&apos;, has recently been inspected,     The district, which lies in the angle between the estuary of the Blackwater and the sea covers about 14 ,000 acres.     Of this some 4,000 acres consists of the I;marshes&quot; a valuable tract of drained alluvial land along the sea, devoted to grazing and corn production.   In the centre , along the line of the proposed railway, lies a strip of very   fine arable land on the Brick Earth (about   2,000 acres) and Valley Gravel (about 3,000, acres) formations.     This area is farmed on general lines, mostly corn and such crops (including some grown forsecd) as are calculated to make but small demands on       :  ... transport.   West of this central area the soil gradually merges into London Clay (about 5,000 acres) and is given up largely to grass and.., to a less extent, to wheat and boans.The district eastwards offers great possibilities of 1 combining arable farming and   dairying, the &quot;marshes&quot; affording grazing for milking cows and young stock.     But with the nearest rail at Southruinster dairying is not likely to become general. With better transport it might be p-rcatly extended,
,,The formation of the c en ire If area, Brick ;-:arth and Valley Gravel, In the same aa that of the neighbourhood of Southend, Orsett, Romford and Barking    end highly favourable for the development of market gardening and fruit gsowjng.&apos;.    Thus the district, given better transport facilities, might be looked to to make up for the encroachment, for building purposes&apos;, on these other areas.     Bradwell. is reputed to be- the earliest, mildest and least frost-affected locality in Bssex.Another industry which might be greatly extended is that of seed growing, for which the district, mild, dry and sunny, is eminently adapted,Further;, the alluvial land is probably as fine as any in England for wheat growing, and, with improved transport, production might be intensified, potato crops taking the place of bare fallows.*Finally, improvement in transport facilities might lead to the enclosure of thousands of acres of potentially valuable &quot;saltings&quot; along the foreshore.Training Branch.1.

It appears, therefore, thsjt the area scheduled is not sufficiently wide.&apos; Another report states that many further outbreaks have been notified, from districts such as Bedford, Kiddle sex, Essex, Surrey&apos;,. Kent, Oxford and Norfolk..Inspectors have been, occupied in inspecting crops of  &apos; potatoes in all parts of Dngland to see that immune varieties fyave&apos;&apos; been planted in Infected areas and in watching the lifting&apos;of susceptible varieties in other areas.Ame r io an Go os eb e r r y Hi Id ew.   During the War practically no work:.&apos;- &apos; was*&quot;aens&quot;Tn&quot;scheduling&apos; gardens &apos;and nurseries where this-disease occurred, and naturally when the subject was reviewed it wad -apparent that the present order was insufficient.

This disease appears to do pevcre damage in cerram land but is&apos; an almost negligible disease in others.   In America it is reported to &quot;he a serious disease and in Ireland it undoubtedly causes much loss in value of the potato crops by dis-figuring the. tubers and rendering them unsaleable. Although this disease generally does but little harm to potato crops in England, a re ort. has been received from. Derbyshire stating that the-the potato crops were absolutely spoilt by Corky.

Apparently some varieties are much more, susceptible than others;. lochar was the variety most badly attacked whilst Great.Scots and Kerrs Pink on the same plot were also affected.Onion., Smut^     The District Inspector for the Forth of England has made a&apos;very&quot;careful investigation of Onion Smut in the Newcastle District and has sent in a report showing that this disease has been present-in certain gardens for the past 12 years but so far has not spread to neighbouring gardens.LABOUR DIVISION.Demobilisation,_    The number of men described as Agriculturists-demobilised, during--the. a even days .      ended the 8 th October was 2261, making the total. demobilised to that date 262,883.you m j s branch.. .The. demand for women to lift potatoes is in excess of the available supply.A report comes from Cumberland that during the- strike the Organising Secretary was commandeered to carry mails and. food between Workington, Cockermouth and Carlisle.

The main activities of the Division have peen centred during the last week upon the putting into motion of the Government scheme of assistance for the Herring Fishing,     The scheme came into
9 l\ 30 KJ &apos;doperation as from the 7th October, and the Committee is. now sitting almost daily, and the scheme may he said to he in full swing.     The situation, however, has not been without difficulties.     In the first instance, there was a distinct tendency - not entirely unexpected - on the part of certain curers to hold aloof from the scheme with a view to seeing what they could make without coming into it.     Any considerable defection on the part of the Curers would have proved a serious menace, but the situation has been restored by the timely action and generous co-operation of the Ministry of Food, who have made an Order requiring every Curer to take out a. licence before he can conduct the business of curing.;     the condition of such a licence being the payment of 45/- per cran, to. the fishermen.     This may, no doubt, be regarded a3 an arbitrary Order, but it will have the desired effect, and it is understood, that Curers are now Only too anxious to sign the terms of the Government Agreement,In the second place, there has been an acute shortage of salt, and the BoardVs Outdoor Staff has been busily engaged..in exploring every means of overcoming the difficulty.     It has eventually been&apos;: arranged&apos; that the Ministry of. Shipping shall place at the disposal of the Salt Union, upon terms to be arranged,, a coastal steamer for the conveyance of salt from Liverpool to Yarmouth and Lowestoft,     On the other hand, the Ministry of Transport have given the Board an assurance that they will lose no time in expediting the numerous trucks of salt, some of which,; undoubtedly, were- held up owing to the strike, which are now on rail somewhere between Nantwich (md neighbourhood) and Lowes toft and Yarmouth.Thirdly, there has been a great shortage of accommodation for the numerous fisher girls who always arrive, when the. Autumn Herring fishing commences, to.gut. and;pack the fish,    &apos;The War Office were, approached, without success, for the use&apos;of the Barracks at&apos; Yarmouth, the Admiralty were similarly approached with regard to the. accommodation which they possessed at Yarmouth-.    -Lastly, the Air Ministry are now being.pressed for certain hutments, and&apos; at the moment it cannot be definitely said whether this accommodation will be available,.     The. position,, however, seems to have been relieved a good deal by the action of. the Mayor, in asking all householders to put at the general disposal such accommodation as they had, &quot;Fourthly, there has been considerable difficulty with regard to the supply of coal, especially at Lowestoft whore the Coal Merchants have repeatedly shown a preference for English vessels, with the result that the Scottish vessels cannot go to sea,     The matter has been taken up verbally -by this Department-in conjunction with the Food Controller, and it has now been arranged that if the Board will... furnish the-Coal Controller with a list of all the Coal, Merchants at. Lowestoft and Yarmouth, the Coal. Controller will instruct; them to. submit, a. statement to the Herring -Executive Committee showing their existing stocks,: so that; the; Herring Executive Commit tee, may give instructions as to how -those, stocks are to be issued to vessels requiring them.     This is a.very drastic.step in the right direction, and will&apos;practically mean that the Herring Executive Committee will control the issue of all stocks of:coal available for the Autumn fishing,     It, should be mentioned that the Food Controller has again been most helpful in co-operating in this matter,&apos;: and was quite willing to issue an Order as a last resort&quot;which would have made the Herring Hxecutive Committee a rationing body.
)Herring Duties imposed by French Governmenti 1   Correspondence has &apos;k recently taken place between the Board and the Board of Trade as to &quot;&apos;-the possibility of moving the French Government temporarily to remove or reduce the existing import duty on cured herrings, which is now about 17/- per cran,    .The view of the Board of Trade is that, having regard to the present French financial situation; it is not likely that the Trench Government -Will make any concession in the matter, and, consequently, the subject is not being pressed for the present,Dissolution of Port Fishery Advisory Committees.   A notice has been receivecf^from the Admiralty to the effect that the Port Fishery Advisory Committees, appointed to act in connection with the Admiralty scheme for the control of fishing during the war, have now been dissolved.     The Board are in full concurrence with the action taken by the Admiralty..   - These Committees are no longer necessary.Compensation to Inhabitants of Hallsands,   Conaiderable correspondence has taken ,place between the Board and the Board of Trade in regard to the compensation to be awarded by the Government to the villagers of Hallsands in Devon, for the destruction of their village by a storm in 1917.     A Committee of Inquiry into the matter reported that the damage was largely due to certain removals of shingle carried out on Government behalf.     The Committee assessed the damage at  10,250, but the Board of Trade have declined.to pay more than  8,000, although the Board have pointed out that the larger sum is fairly due.     Work on the reconstruction of the village on a new site is in progress.Fishermen in Scotland and Unemployment. Doles.,   Recen11 y the Ministry&quot; &quot;of&quot;Labour asked, the&quot;Board, for advice on the subjeot of a demand from fishermen at Banff and Buckie for unemployment allowance to be granted them after the termination of the Herring Fishing in SeptemberD     The Board explained that it had no concern with Scottish affairs, but pointed out that the expiration of what is known to be a seasonal employment should not be urged as a claim for being out of work, especially as Moray Firth fishermen can always find work in other branches of fishing.     The Ministry of Labour have promised to report promptly to the Board if similar applications are received from English fishermen.Library Re-organisation.   A small Committee of members of the Board&apos;s staff has been formed to consider what books etc,., it is essential to acquire at once in order to bring the Scientific Fisheries Library up to a reasonable standard of efficiency;   to estimate the. coot of such acquisition and to revise the list of periodicals to be taken in*     The formation of this Committee is very necessary if the Library is to be re-organised and to become of use for the Scientific Staff,Marking....of. ffreoks, located by fishing vessels in the North Sea. Copies of certain correspondence between the Admiralty and the Grimsby Fisherraens1 Trade Union,  on the subject of marking of wrecks in the North Sea, has recently i.een forwarded to the Board by the Admiralty, as really being a matter concerning this Board, the Admiralty having prepared wreck charts, and therefore disclaiming further responsibility.     The Board have advised the Trade Union thydt it considers the action already taken by the Admiralty in the matter to be all.that&apos;can reasonably be done, and trusts that time will familiarise&apos; fishermen with the wreck situation, and enable them to avoid, loss of gear,    :The Board reminded the Union that their suggestion for&apos; the. demolition of wrecks by blowing them up would only increase the area of the danger zone.
0 n njFeared Labour Troubles at Fleetwgod.   A short tine ago the Mercantile Marine&quot; Trawlers Association of Fleetwood, sent to the Board a copy of a Petition they had addressed to the Prime Minister, asking for his intervention in certain labour disputes that had arisen between them and the Fleetvood Fishing Vessel Owners&apos; Association.    Nothing further has been heard, and the Board are now making enquiries as to how the matter stands, since the petitioners also asked for the Board&apos;s assistance to effect a meeting between the parties.    Up to the present no reply has been received.- Assistance to Colonies in the Appointment of.....FisheryAtIASiv?3.*Recently the Colonial Office, at &quot;the &quot;request &quot;of the Federated Malay States, asked the Board&apos;s assistance in selecting a suitable person for appointment as Inspector of Fisheries in those States.     This affords a further proof of the fact that the Board are more and more regarded as the proper body to advise as to the appointment of Scientific Officials required to fill Colonial fishery appointments..Projected Vessel for Fishery Research.   As the result of a Conference which &quot;he has had with the^Naval Architect, who is preparing plans for the Board&apos;s Research steamer, the Marine Superintendent to the Scottish Fishery Board, in View of the advanced stage of completion of the remaining &quot;Lord Mersey&quot; trawlers now building for the Admiralty, has decided to urge his Department, to build afresh, rather than to take over and alter one of the completing ships, from the Admiralty.     He will now, therefore, suggest that the two Fishery Departments should agree on definite plans and build sister ships, thus economising in cost of construction and supervision of construction.     He approved generally the English plans.    This is a.satisfactory conclusion to a question that has for some time been under the consideration of both Departments.Lieut. Rowton^ Mine Deflector.   The question of the desirability of using some form of device for preventing the entry of mines into trawl nets has again been brought to the Board&apos;s notice by the arrival of a Swedish Official interested in Lieut. Rowton&apos;s device. This device has not yet been tested on any large scale by fishing, vessels engaged in their ordinary operations.   &quot;Certain tests have, however, been made at Grimsby by steam trawlers, and, with the assistance of the Trawler Owners&apos; Association, an attempt is being made to extract any information these results may yield.     In view of the promising nature of the few tests which have been made^as to the efficiency of the device for the purpose for which it is designed, irrespective of any effect on fishing, it is very desirable that no effort should be spared to secure exhaustive trials, and there seems some reason to believe that the Association mentioned would co-operate in these tests.The matter   enters on a new phase by the statement of Officials of the Fishermen&apos;s Union at Grimsby that the men are greatly in favour of employing any effeotive device of the nature of a deflector, and may even refuse to eail without one.    The opinion&quot; has hitherto been widely held that the men would refuse, to use* any safety device.    Several ships are now,, however,, overdue at (brimsby and the Union Officials,. who are in touch with the inyenter,, may   &apos; press both for the use of the deflector and for heavier penalties on skippers entering mined areas*Demobilisation.   A further list of 14. fishing vessels to be-, sent by the Admiralty for demobilisation has. been, received,     Tnie brings the total number released at BJnglifh and V/eleh ports to 1,316, (of which 870 are 9team trawlers, and 446 steam drifters). The usual advices have been sent to the Coal Controller and the-&apos; Ministry of Pood.- -
9 ii pReleases of men required for the fishing service continue to be secured not only from the Army and Navy, bub al3 0 from theShipping and Air Services,     Tiresome delays occur, however, in certain cases (principally with Army men in India) but such cases are brought persistently to the attention of the authorities concerned,An interesting !:side-issue&quot;, case has just been concluded which has been in hand for some months,     A Naval rating named Laidler was &quot;demobilised&quot; at the Board&apos;s request for the month of July, 1918, in order to assist in the herring fishery on the North East Coasto     He returned to Naval Service in August, and in the following October, learned, that his wife * s separation allowance was not being paid because he had not made&apos; out a fresh declaration on re-joining.     The matter was then put right as regards future payments, but the Admiralty rejected hrs. Laidlers claim for payments for the period August - October.     The matter came to the Board&apos;s notice in April last when the Admiralty maintained that their attitude was technically corrects     The Board, howaver, made thorough enquiries, and pressed upon the Admiralty their considered view, that there wa3 in equity a strong case for the payment of the arrears. In the end it was admitted that there had been some misunderstanding; and the allowances have now been paid in full.Economic Division,Statistical,,Branchi   The number of corn claims received during the week amounts to 32,000, the total received to date being 165,000.     Besides examining and filing these returns, considerable work has been necessitated in checking the Inspectors&apos; bills for expenses.The fish landed in September amounted to 1,031,000 cwts.,   h the increase over last month being due td the herring fishery.     The average value per cwt, is about the same as in August.Markets Branchn   Supplies of fat cattle and sheep were larger during the week ending 8th October than in the previous week at practically all the country markets, Inyb the numbers at London and Salford were very small, as a result of the railway strike,     As in recent weeks, the majority of the cattle were in a more or less unfinished condition, but sheep have benefited from the recent fine weather and growth of grass, and are now coming forward in better condition than recently.     There were also larger supplies of pigs at most of the country markets, but, owing to the transport difficulties, very few were offered at Birmingham and Manchester. The price of veal calves advanced considerably, and the best quality realised cn the average about 14d. per lbfc. as compared with ll df per lb, a fortnight ago.     Prices for all descriptions of dead meat (beef, mutton and lamb) were advanced 2-^d. per Tb0 on 6th October,Supplies of apples and pears are declining and prices advanced slightly,     British onions were cheaper, owing to the operation of the maximum price, which is  14 per ton.     Tomatoes generally sold at higher rates,    Potatoes-were generally dearer than in the previous week, owing mainly to the high cost of motor transport;   but at Liverpool quotations&apos; were lower for local potatoes.Certificates were issued for the export of four horses and one donkey to France:    two ponies to Argentina;   thirty-one cattle and fifty nine sheep to Uruguay,,     Also twenty-one certificates for the export of forage to Jersey were issued.Farm JEorkftrs 1 -Branch.

Agricultural &quot;Wages Board,   Summonses were issued against an employer rn*lleYvro:;dshire&quot; for underpayment of two boys 16 years of age. The cases were heard on i;he 4th October at Hertford,     The defence was&apos; that the boys had worked short, hours;   but they alleged that overtime on wool: days and Sundays had been worked.     The Defendant was convicted and fined .87 and ordered to pay arrears amounting to  2.16,0. and  1,18.0 respectively,A case was down for hearing at Petworth, Sussex, on the 4th October.     A few days previously, however, the agent of the employer asked if the case would be withdrawn on payment by him of the full arrears and costs of the proceedings,     The worker who had been underpaid was one bo whom a permit of exemption would probably have been granted if applied for,,     Por this reason and other special circumstances of the case the summonses were withdrawn on the conditions mentioned above,,a case was heard at Bury St. Edmunds on 8th October where the point at issue was the legality of a value placed on certain cottages by the District Wages Committee.     The workers in question were being paid the minimum rate except that a sum greater than that assessed by the District Wages Committee was being deducted by the employer in respect of their cottages,     This action on the part of the employer was intentional as he wished to test the finding of the District Wages Committee as he was not present when the inspection took place, when the assessment was made by the District Wages Committee or when the decision was confirmed by the Agricultural Wages Board0     The Court decided that a technical offence had been committed and fined the Defendant l/* on each of 9 summonses.On Saturday the 11th October, an employer was summoned at Warwick for underpayment of three workers.     This case was brought as a test case in order to obtain the decision of the Courts as to whether a private garden from phioh a considerable quantity of the produce was sold., was to be considered a market garden within the meaning of the Core Production A.ct, 35170     The Court without making any comment dismissed tho case and were therefore asked to state a special case for the consideration of the High Court, which they consented to do.An employer in Essex was summoned for failing to pay the minimum wage to a worker in her employ.     Owing to the special circumstances of the case and the fact that the worker was of a very considerable age it was decided at the defendant&apos;s request to with-draw the summonses on payment of all the arrears due and the costs. The case was to have boon heard on the 13th instant *During the week 36 cases of complaint of non-payment of the minimum rales were received., the largest number from a single county being 6 in the case of Devchv,     One&apos;hundred and seventy-seven cases were sent to Inspectors&apos;for visit;    enquiries by correspondence wpr^ made in 112 cases and Z&apos;6 cases were completed, Reports were received from Inspectors in 115 cases012 ax Pro due t - ip.nJ8rpopo h.The hair vest is no?; completed,Considerable delay in the progress of the factories has been caused by the failure of deliveries of bricks, cement and other
