He.believed the community would - like to pay for it and the General Managers wanted a contented staff. There could, be no permanent peace on the railways until confidence is re-established on both sides.     Legislation to prevent strike^ was impracticable but everyone should try to minimise them.      * He urged that the best results
9 Pt Qresults could only be Obtained if railwayman were tree/to^ as partners and they were prepared to co-operate, but their status must be properly recognised.    He handed in proposals for a scheme prepared by the National Union of Railwaymen for the control of railways (Appendix &quot;C&quot;) and asked that the Prime Minister would consider it.The Prime Minister replied that the documents handed in required careful consideration as tha suggestions made were far reaching and at prosent he could say nothing, but ha undertook to examine Mr. ThomasTs statements arn the proposed scheme, and would meet the men again next week.The meeting then adjourned until Thursday, 23rd October, at 2.30.
MR, THOMAS* HRST STATEMENTThere are two vital questions involved in the present appeal of the railway workers for standardisation of wages,   First, it has to he ensured that the method of classification shall he such as to ensure the full recognition of the Trade Union principL&amp;$ of collective bargaining and the standard rate*   This means that the classification must be uniform for all railways,&apos; and must be simple bo as to avoid,an undue-multiplication of Grades9Secondly, the&quot;rates fixe&amp; for the clanses agreed to must be fair rates, and must ensure to the railway worleers a reasonable standard of living at least comparable with that enjoyed with other trades *I shall deal separately with these two points; but before I approach them in detail, it will be necessary to make certain general remarks by way of introduction^It is hardly necessary to labour the point - for it has been explicitly admitted by the Prime Minister and by Mr, Bonar Law -that the wages of railwayman before the war were scandalously low, both in&quot;relation to any conception of a satisfactory standard of lifej and in relation to the wages paid in other Industries0   There are many reasons which account for this; but undoubtedly tho principal reason was that, until a short time before the warj railwaymen had not boon sufficiently well organised to apply with success the methods of collective bargaining that had long &quot;been success-fully employed In other industries *   The N.UtK* was brought into existence in 1913, and it is a fact that cannot be disputed that, when War broke out in 1914, the organised railwaymen wore on the eve of securing substantial advances in wages *   In view of the national emergency, thoy patri-otieaily postponed their wages programmes and the only advances since secured have been war advances given solely&apos;  -for the purpose of meeting the increased cost of living di-roetly caused by the wai%   In these circumstances, I submit that the pre-war wages of railway workers afford no satis-factory basis on which to argue what thoir wages should be at the present time or in the future and that accordingly it is misleading and off the point to refer to the fact that the Governments late proposals contemplated an average increase of about 100 por oent. on pro-war rates * lo are here to consider not what railwaymen were receiving before the war in the bad times which the Prime Minister has repeatedly denounced, but what is the least&apos;that railwaymen have a right to expect in the future*
r/it)i these few words of introduction, I can proceed at once to the discussion of the first of the two points which are before us to-day.    Any. system of wages standardisation on the railway involves first&apos; of all unification of the basis  of pay-ment as between the. various railway systems of. this country. This point is not disputed and can be regarded as settled;   but it is important to state clearly, from our point of view, what such unification involves.    Almost every Trade Union which has successfully established the principle of. collective bargaining has had to fight, at one stage or another, a battle for the principle of the standard rate,    Again and,again, there has been manifested, on the side of the employers, a desire for an undue and unnecessary multiplication of grades and classes, while the Trade Unions, in order to make collective bargaining a reality, have successfully resisted this attempt, and have \ insisted that any system of classification or grading shall be^ broadly and clearly&quot; drawn, so,as to reduce the number of grades and classes to a minimum,,    Ihere this is not done, the success-ful establishment of-collective bargaining is impossible, and the standard rate, which is the first essential of Trade Union wage negotiations, disappears in a welter of varying rates which often approximate to disguised methods of piecework payment. It is therefore necessary to insist that the system of classified-tion adopted shall be&apos; simple and straight-forward, both inin order that discontent may not be caused by differences in wages depending upon trivial or non-existent differences in the character of the work performed,I cannot stress too strongly the,vital character of this principle of the standard rate.    Unification of wages as between the employees of different Companies cannot be made a reality unless it is based&apos;upon a clear and simple system of classification reducing the classes and rates 01 payment to the smallest possible number.This brings me to tha second point - that of the actual rates to be fixed.    At this stage it is not my purpose to dis-cuss in detail the rates proposed, but to put forward the general arguments which lead irresistibly to the conclusion that the proposals recently formulated by the Government do not form even a possible basis for discussion.    As I have said, the question must be considered in relation not to pre-war rates, but to a reasonable conception of the standard of life and to the rates paid to workers in other industries certainly no more essential to the community than the railway service.First, let me refer further to the disparity which existed before the war between the earnings of railway workers and those of other classes of labour.    Even if the lowest paid classes of workers in the other Ereat industries of the country are taken as a standard of comparison, the railway workers&apos; position was uniformly worse than the position of&apos;such workers.(   &apos; . In the Abstract of Labour Statistics for 1914 rates are given for a number of occupations.    Par be it from me to defend these rates as affording even a.minimum standard of civilisedhffi&apos;     hilt:   I   am nnlv  fvwi Virr frt wn^^       *. ; ^  _______i ______order that the complication of be lessened, and
Thus,&quot;in the case of boot and shoe operatiros, tho lowest rate recorded anywhere was 26/-, and in the :ia/-,i:. .i-.t centres the rate-received by the lowest paid- class of lcV&quot;. r for which reborns are given wts 30/^,   Policemen receive a a S&apos;V:   .     niniiran cf 30/- in many of the pvtncipy&amp; oantres, and ths rate rccc-jeo. even&apos;; for the&apos; emUest country district was&apos; 22/-; which 1b at least 5/- better th.au the lowest railway r*/^ k\   Jvutlders1 labourers received 5d an hour in a few small aantiss; but&apos;in the great majority the rates ranged from 6d to 8d an hour- or on an are-ragsr:- -weak of 52 hours from 86/- to 34/8*Labourers employed by local S3.itlicriti.es received such minimum rates as 24/.-C Hartlepool),  5/- (Carlisle, w*. Eartlspool Stockton, etc,) 25/6 (Darlington) 26/.. (Barnsiey,Newcastle,etc); in tha London -area 30/- a weak in Westminster       7 d or 8d per hour were typical rates for labourers&quot;, s wee peasant! similar classes of workers, while the Office of Works paid to labourers 28/- in London and 31/-. at Elthanu    The War Offie* paid builders * l&amp;bourara 29/6 at Woolwich and 30/- at Bnfioia Lock.Turning to transport^ typical dockers^ ratas for the lowest&quot;\, paid classes of wozfc were 8d and. Vfrd par hour/at Cardiff and 81 at Uethll,     Stable hands and washers received 24/- and 24/6 in tfea Newcastle tramway sheds, while cleaners et Sunderland raeaiTed 25/*.-   All those are rates for the lowast paid classes of labour, comparable only with taa very lowest rates payable cm the railways^In the mining Industry before the war, the lowest rate paid to js&amp;y underground worker was 26/** for a weak of six shifts, and 80 low a wage was antlraly excaptioaa&amp;X,,    Labourers received 28/5, hauliers 3*1/6* trimmers 3l/S, underground banksmen 36/3, and their assistants 33/8*   These ara typical rates, given on the , authority of Mrc  inlay Gibson of the South Wales Ctoalowaers&apos; Association, and presented &quot;by him before the Coal Industry Commission.    It the saroa time, the average weekly earnings for all classes of surface workers worked out at 31/2 for isLx shifts, and the average for the lowest paid classes of surface&apos; labour at 88/10,    The work B&amp;m &quot;by many of these j&amp;jrfcars was closely eamparabla with that of the lowest paid gradas of railwayman, &apos;If wa &quot;ton to workers other than those of th* lowest scales the disproportion is evermore striking*     In tha building tradas, the rates ranged from Iljd per hour, which was paid not -only i&amp; London, but in cthgtr large tewns to lOd and M pay hour In other towns and country aiatriots, absolutely tba lowest rate re-corced except for labourers baingpar hour, or on an average weak of 5E hours^ 26/10*   Engineers received 40/- in London, an average of 36/- in other large towns, and of. 36/- in smallsr places, the absolutely lowest rate recorded being; 84/-*.   Shipwrights varied similarly from 4-2/* in London and -some o ther cant res to 41/- in large centres to 3v7- in smaller places, the absolutely lowest rsta being 34/-*    Electricians ranged &quot;from 9i$4 to 9d in large towns - to 8-.sd in -smaller centres, the absolutely lowest rate &quot;being- 8d per hour.   In the printing&apos; industry, compositors varied from a minimum of 39/- in London, to 58/-panel 57/- in larga toms, 35/- in smaller places, and a lowest rate in om or two small centres of 33/***   Per bookbinding tha corres-ponding rates wore 36/-, 35 and 24, 32/- and SO.
2 6 iDIn face of those  acts, it is Impossible to maintain that the pre-war ra*3s of rallw&amp;y workers w.er$ anything other thanscandalousj, or lira take such rates as a porisible basis on whioh to detamtaOj. by way of percentage inereaoe, what their post-war ratatf are to bo0    We have to make a ciUan. flirt 9 and to ask, wiv-honS r^fsrsrorf to what obtained previously, what are the mtvm-ra icvW^ that must be paid in  utoe*    In our view, the only f/oasiVUi course to adopt Is to take as a basis tha wages now paid, .original-aalng tiie war advancesp and to proceed to the task of unification and standardisation/on the basis of aocept-ihg these rates as permanent,T.t is necessary in this oornestion to refer to the position in other trades *    Sir Robert Hteie, addressing a conference-of !Drads Unionists last&apos;mow$h9 adjured them to get together with their employers without delay with a view to diseasingtha marking of war adrentes in permanent rates of wa^es.     He referred the other trades to uhe railwayman as a goad example to be followed, and quoted tho agraemi.it arrived as for the locomotive grades as an example for other industries,,     That&apos; was b3fo.ro tho Strikes    On that occasion tha other Trades made it slear to tho Minister of Labour that any at rapt to reduce wages will be resisted wish the whole strength of the Trade Union Movement,The mere fact that the railwaymen are early in the field in discussing with those who represent their employers the consolidation of war advances into -permanent wages makes the position mare difficult than it&quot;would otherwise be;   for it is difficult to point to cases in whioh the&apos; merging has already taken place,      here are indeed notably in the textile Indus-tries instances in which this has taken place;   bat owing to the almost exclusively p^&apos;*wo*2R    character of&apos; these industries, it is difficult to draw deductions which oan be applied to the present case.    There are, however, certain Oases whioh it is necessary to qnota0    In the bailding trades, a big movement for the conformation of wages over wide areas has recently been aack)ffi&apos;oll3hodo &apos;   I quote from the agreement arrived at for Yorkshire (the terms of the Lancashire settlement- being praetleaJly identical)&amp;    Under this agreement, the following consolidated xatoJ2 are established;-  Skilled Workers are to receive l/8d0 per&quot;hour in the large towns, l/7d, par hour in the smaller towns 9 ana l/6d* per hoar in a very small number of country discsj-iotSa     Ihe corresponding figures for bulldera1 labourers ark(.L/ 53.,, l/4do, and l/3&amp;., per hour.     On a 46j hour week sow&quot;being worked, this means approximately for craftsmen 77/Sdo, VS/v^do, and 69/9d, and for labourers 65/l M. 5 /&apos;-. and  8/l .     Tn-as, the builders- labourers have -already eeoured even in the smallest country distrists of Yorkshire, a consolidated minimum wages if 58/1-p.,, whereas the stabilised minimum war wage of the railway workers under last week1s settlement is only 5l/-.    Moroc-Yor, the building trades1 , labourers  minimum only applies In the smallest districts and the great majority are on higher rates amounting, on the -46^- hours1 week &quot;to 66/10^    or 68/*.0
Again, 1st me take the case of the bakery trade, where the&apos;war advances were consolidated under an agreement of September,1918,    To the rates then secured must be&quot;added the 5/-* advance of August 1919,    This makes the minimum rate for table hands 65/-, in industrial areas and 60/** in rural areas. With this may be compared the recent settlement of August for Co-operative employees in the North of England, which ensures an absolute minimtaa of 60/** to the lowest paid class of adult male workers .    In Jfcnmouthshirc, a minimum consolidated rate established last January now assures 66/- to the lowest paid grades of casual labourers, except infirm workers, who are secured a minimum of 60/-*    I quote this case, because most of the other available wages paid by local authorities have not yet boon consolidated,,Sven suoh a sweated trade as the tobacco trade has secured through its Trade Board a minimum wage of 55/-. to the lowest paid class of adult male labour, and the Trade Board awards of 1/113., per hour in the Corset and Paper Bag Trades also ensures 55/-, on a 48-hours8 week.     It is, or course9 notorious that many Trade Boards rates have been for a long time inoperative&apos; owing to the higher rates which are actually being paid  Thus, even Trade Boards, which are supposed to provide only for the most sweated classes oi workers are issuing awards enforcing minimum rates higher than the total amount of wages and war advances payable to a very large proportion of railway workers.     An absolute minimum of 557- to the lowest paid male workers in the cocoa and chocolate trades furnishes a further example of this fact*Turning&quot;to a different class of industry, I wish next to cite the case of the rates at present paid even to the lowest paid &quot;classes of workers in the&quot; mining industry.   At the present time, the lowest class of underground workers, according to Mr Finlay Gibson1 s figures, is receiving 76/9d.   Of this IB/- re pre-sents the 3/- per day war wage, - It is a telling contrast to point; out that, even if this 18/- is left out of account, the lowest paid class of underground mining labour is in receipt of a permanent weekly i/?age of 58/9d, or 7/93 more than the lowest rate &quot;for railway workers? including not 1&amp;/-, hut 33/- war wage, To crown all, this is paid for a 42 hours week as against 48 for railway workers.     Moreover, in the ease of arming surface worfc-ers. the average isage to day is&apos;.75/8d, while even when all,the higher paid grades are left out. the average for the lowest paid grades is about 71/- ,the lowest rate for shunters on the surface of collieries in South Wales being 76/-*
This brings me to the last of the main points which I wish to bring Before you. to-day0    I wish to make it perfectly plain that I aw arguing against (ho Governments reconr proposals and&apos;in favour of at least a,complete.consolidation of all -war advances into permanent wages, not on the basis of the present cost of living, which is agreed to be at least-115 per cent above the pre-war cost, &quot;but irrespective of that cost,&apos; in the sense that 1 m. arguing in favour of the retention of k% least the present level&apos;of wages even when prices fall back to a-normal post-war levels whatever that may ultimately prove tonh&amp;*,    I Bm feat the Minister of Health bases certain cal-eaXa.ilens ott tho asstnapfcion that in seven years time the cost -of living will 1$ two-thirds of what it is now, that -is to say, at least ever 40 percent above the pre-war level,    1 think this is as ontdmistic estimate; but if its correctness is assumed, 1 ftill contend that no one can reasonably maintain that the existing wages of railway servants would do more than provide a miiiisiiam standard of existence under such circumstances &quot;such as swif railway worker has a right to expect in return for hisfe m&amp;% Mb out of our mills onoe and for all the Mas feat there 0as m a retina to jm**mt Gon&amp;itioas in respect either of money wag&amp;s or of wages m&amp;gRxwik by the eost of, living, and m mxmt insist m a misdssm wMjsl will enal&amp;e the works? to : secure, a reasonable .stsriiar&amp; of eesaforfco to-Itowatref, in Ms reooat took ^^lpaAM^J^Jftox,nas csalisuiated thai*5,     pre-war pn&amp;ea, M ** is tse minimum tnat eoulill^ -regarded as^exBtffingi&amp;ndh a standard.   Add to this 40 per cent m* tie least si vkMk the pernasent Increase in price levels can possibly he estimated, shd to gel a minimum of 61/7*, as the lowest reasonable $intern even is&amp;ea&quot;sad if prices reach this - level in seven years&apos; toe*   Xarfa&amp;e of this &quot;estimate, who caamhaiain feat It Is anything egeept reasonable and moderate to-ta&amp;e as the.lowest&quot; possible basis for standardisation. In mj oast, the incflusioa in permanent wages of the whole of thes&amp;moea granted during the Wait, Iron this would leave a margin of over 10/- between the 51/- which is now the lowest adullrrailwpj wage and the minimum estimate of she taian needs of labour if tei&quot; prices have fallen &quot;by 75 gear cent out of tie lib per       hyifeli they have advaneeds ime 1914. t While, there-lore, the ksliBioa of the whole of the war wage m the new    .^ standard wuld provide a basis on which we couM proceed to far discussion of ffie adtxaL rales to be assured, tnas does not toean feat the new standard will not have to be confinerably IMier than the wages now paid, if the gulf between railwayman, an! ether class QtvoxkmU to he oridged.
Whilst the previous statement which I have read is aimed in the direction of showing the absolute necessity of a higher, minimum for the lower paid &quot;grades, I desire now to emphasise -the case of what are called&apos;&quot;the more highly skilled railway-men, and in this connection I desire to&quot;&apos;emphasise what is some-times forgotten? that the railwayman starts his life on the railway and it is one long apprenticeship,   There arc many grades in which he starts as a boy and does not&apos;&quot;reach the maximum until after 25 or 30 years1&apos; service.   No one will disguise for a moment the efficiency of &quot;the British railway system.    It will also be admitted that it is due as much to the men as to the manage-ment.    Hie mortality of passengers is one in 198,000,000 killed &apos; or injured per annum, but to bring about this stare of efficiency, in some grades in the service, such as shunters, it is one in eighteen killed or injured; platelayers, one in twenty-eight; goods guards one in twenty. &quot;Approximately five hundred railwaymen of all grades are killed annually, that is. three every two days in the year. /This in itself is a factor that must be considered in connection with the men Is remuneration.  And as I have said, their skill and responsibility must also be considered.   Take the case of passenger guards.   The London and Month Western present minimum rate is 25/- and :the maximum 35/-,  -The rate ofiered is minimum 48/-,maximum 60/- which is.. 92-i increase on the minimum and 71fo on the maximum.   But surely bus conductors cannot be called more responsible than the guards in charge of passenger trains from London to Plymouth or London to. Liverpool, or a goods guard in     * . charge of a heavy mineral train&apos;from &quot;South &apos;5ales to London, and yet bus conductors1 wages are  3,13.6 ner week.    Take a carman. London, and North Western minimum is 23/-,maximimi 29/-, rate offered 52/-. Compare with the one horse, &quot;drivers, in London -  3.10.0 per week. Take the case of goods porters.North Eastern minimum 25/-, maximum 26/-, rate offer eel 44/*.   HMa &quot;is only 76% above pre-war: standard. Take-the oas^e of checkers, 29/-&quot;per week,&apos;offered&apos; 52/-3   Compare these with builders&apos; labourers,&apos;the figures of which are .riven and&quot;will show an unfair comparison,   The platelayers in the South wales Collieries &quot;who work side by side &quot;with the railway platelayers, are paid  3*18.0 per week minimum up to  5,0,0 maxiimui.   You yourself know the comparison with/policemen,   The London postman rise to a maximum of 43/- plus 24/- war wage plus .2Gj&amp;,   Compare that with the rates offered.   But above all, compare it with the locomotive settlement itself for drivers and firemen, where (3/6) for firemen was brought to the highest rate plus the War wage;   the same with the drivers,&quot; Surely the same argument applies to the grades I have mentioned.- . . .Whilst it is true also that most grades have had a reduction to eight hours a day, you nmst remember that there are eight-hour shunters and eight-hour signalmen whose hours were hot reduced, but whose rate per hour was as much as that of the driver on a ten-hour basis,   whilst no proposal has.been made for signalmen, this fact must not be overlooked.That, generally, is the case; I have to submit,   we want a contented railway service.   The people are prepared to pay for it, We do not consider you can have a,contented&quot; service whilsx the railway1 men are compelled to work side by side with men whose skill and -experience is less, but who are in private employment and are re-ceiving considerably higher wages, &quot;&apos;14-th (VteberiJrS19;^in?..tjt. www w^v^mm mat .
