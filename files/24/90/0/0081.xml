J(THIS DOCU-E^T IS-THE PROPERTY OF &quot;HIS BR ITALIC -MAJESTY1 S GOVERN EflT) *3 E C R E T.       !/V, WAR CABINET.G. T. 8381.USE OF GOVERNMENT M TOR CARS.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Cabinet decided by Minute 615 (2) of August 14th, that Ministers should give up their motor cars on the adjournment of Parliament for the summer recess, and that in future no mt-tor cars should be allotted to individual officials or used to take officials from their private residences to their offices, but they left undecided the question whether a single department was to be responsible for the cars retained in use, or whether eaoh department was to be allowed to manage such cars as it might be thought to require.     I now ask for a Cabinet decision on this question.For the following reasons I am in favour of a common pool and a centralised control:-(1)   As long as cars are allocated to particular departments, the separate reserves of cars must necessarily &quot;be       g^r   than the single reserve which would be all that was necessary if all cars were pooled.(2)   As long as each department retaining cars -has separate and independent control of those cars, no standardization of the car In use is possible.(3)   As long as the cars remain under separate departmental control, no central authority can exercise an adequate control over their use, or compare the expenditure on cars by one department and that of another depart, tent similarly constituted,If there is to be a Ministry of Supply, that Ministry might be.entrusted with the central pool of cars, or alternatively, cars for official use might be provided by the Ministry of Transport, which would then become responsible for seeing than an adeouate control was exercised over their use and for obtaining proper particulars as to the extent and the purposes for which they were employed.      Unless one Ministry is thus made responsible, I am not satisfied that the intentions of the Cabinet will be - fully carried out. I think it should be the duty of the responsible Ministry not only to supply and control cars used in London, but to inspect and report upon the use of cars in the provinces by provincial officers of th,-. different Departments.(Intel.)
