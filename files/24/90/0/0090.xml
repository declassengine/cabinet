0 0*V -      4...........Tj^^go^umgjtrt^j^ the, projperty^of His Britanriio Majea ty1 s government. Secret.- WAR OABIKDT.G.T. 8390.- GOVEHHMLlHE ADV1JRTL3 TUG,Memo, &quot;by- tho President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.In the memorandum from the Treasury on the above subject (G.To 8334) there appears to he some confusion between advertising and publicity.   The reference to the Treasury Committee of 1917 was confined to the question of the selection of newspapers for Crovern-ment advertisements in order to secure adequate publicity and due economy, hut at the end of the memo, it is suggested that the War Cabinet should rule that all advertis Lug acfl; publicity should he carried out through the Stationery Office and its agents,I raise no objection to the use of the Stationery Office and its agents for placing advertisements and this course is adopted at present by the Board of Agriculture, but if it is intended that the Stationery Office should also undertake all publicity work ffrr government Departments I should feel bound to raise the strongest possible objection.   I doubt if this is the intention of the Treasury, but if not the wording of the recommendation (1) in their Memo, should be amended by the omission of the words &quot;and publicity&quot; The advertising and news departments of a newspaper are entirely separate and distinct, and it would be fatal to employ an advertise-raent asent to place news matter.I may add that the question of publicity as distinct from advertising was considered by the war Cabinet on May 1st last who decided (War Cabinet 561, Minute l) that it should be left to each Department to make its own arrangements for sending its communications to the Press, and I would ur^e that this decision should be adhered to so far as publicity as distinct from advertise-ments is concerned.L Of P.!3rd October, 1919.
