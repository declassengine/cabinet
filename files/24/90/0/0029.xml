HQ uOThis Doo^^t b t!^e Prop^votIMPOHTS AND EXPORTS REGULATION BILL, anduni by the President of the Board of Trade.ts I and II of this Bill contain provisions whose Ject is fa) to safeguard home industries generally from the competition of dumped goods and of goods whose importa-tion is facilitated by tho collapse of a foreign exchange and (b) to afford a special safeguard to manufacturers en-gaged in important Key industries and to growers of hops. Part III of the Bill continues some of the war time powers to prohibit exports of certain description and Part IV contains provisions for financial assistance for the re-ostabllshment of the export trado of the country.^Dumping.    In order not to interfere unduly with import Wade in general the Bill applies the special requirements necessary to combat dumping only to articles in regard to which the Board have reason to believe that systematio and substantial dumping is talcing or is likely to ta&amp;e place and that such dumping will prejudice home manu-factures.    In such cases the provisions of this part of the Bill will be brought into application for the goods conoerned by an Order ef the Board of Trade.    When such an order has been made no goods of the description in question may be imported unless accompanied by (1) a sworn declaration by the consignor stating the foreign value of such good (i.e. the value in the country of origin of similar goods sold there for consumption) and (2) a valid oertlficate by an authorised Consular officer attesting the consignors declaration.The Bill prohibits the importation into the United Kingdom of goods purchased abroad and the first sale in the United Kingdom of goods sent on consignment of any of the desoriptions specified in such an Order at a price below the foreign value unless fa) in the case of goods imported on or after sale the importor pays to the Customs before the clearance of the goods a sum equal to the difference between the import prico and the foreign value and fb) in the case of goods imported without previous sale, the Beller similarly pays the difference to the Board of Trade *r satisfies the Board before the sale that there is seme good cause why the goods should be sold below the foreign value.    Provision is made for the special cases of goods produced partly in one country and partly in another and for goods which are assembled in this country from Imported parts.Key Industries.    Part II of the Bill gives the Board of Waoe power to prohibit the import of certain goods specified in Schedule I the manufacture of which in the United Kingdom it i3 considered desirable to safeguard as being a Key Industry or any particular class or desoriptioiTof those goods as well -as hops.    The Board are given power to license imports of these prohibited goods and if they think fit to charge a fee for such licences (the fee   being paid to the Customs at the time ef clearance.)
Tho fee, the amount of whioh is to he fixed by the Board for periods of not less than three months at a time, may be either an ad valorem or a specific charge and must not exceed the difference between the sterling value of tho imported goods and the price of similar articles in the United iliiigdora.    The Board are required in grantinglicences to have regard to the consideration whether the restriction of importation has raised or is likely to raisa the prices, charged in the United Kingdom for similararticles,    A further safeguard against the inflation of prices through res trie tion &quot;of import is afforded by Clause 11 (i) which enables tho Board to fix maximum prices for the articles in question.    The remainder of Olause 11 provides that no combination agreement shall bo entered into by any industries in Schedule 1 except tith the previous assent of the Board of Trade who are further onabled to obtain information necessary for the purpose of carrying out the foregoing provisions,4,  QQllapse of BxohaagB. Part II of the Bill also gives the Board of Trade power to prohibit tho importation of all or any goods produced in a foreign country on being satisfied that there has been such a depreciation in the sterling value of the currency of that country as, not being adequately compensated &quot;by increased cos&apos;ts of production in that country     or is? likely to cause sales m the United Kingdom of.the products or manufactures of that country to take place in substantial quantities at prices below those at which similar articles manufacturesd in the United Kingdom can be sold.
