That the arrangement arrived at&apos;in Paris should be cenncelled or at least its execution suspended.
2.     That the whole question be,placed before the pence Conference for fir;el settlement without &apos;    delay and be considered by the peace Conference itself or by a Conference appointed by it (con-si sting of British, French ana ;&apos;rab reprcsenta-&quot; tlvos under the presidency of an American.Chair-man ) which will discuss the serious question at issue and render its re; ort to the feece Conference.,I consider the cancellation or suspension of the Paris arrangement as a vital preliminary to a successful solution. Unless this is done the crisis in Syria may be precipitated end events happen which will render discussion, mo tit difficult, I trust, therefore, .tht those demands&quot; which - are essential to tho interests of oil will meet with your approval i nd&apos; thrt I may rely on the help of the British Government to bring them a boa t.1 beg that Your jjxcelleacy will be kind enough to let me have your reely at the earliest poaeible moment. I have the honour to beYour Jxc*,lie..cyTaObedient Servant,(oipnod)   FhL-j/X.The Rt. Hon.The Prime Minister of Great Britain
