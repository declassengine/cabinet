^&quot;ti/ IHP3R1A1 WIRELESS OOmSt^IiTLfm&apos;^^.....-..............-.................&apos; lt I p **^yi&quot;lldmlralty Memorandum for the War Cabinet,ill aiCircumstances hare changed considerably since May 1919 -when the W/T Sub-Committee of the 1,0,0,. rendered its report, which ie quotod by Lord Milner in his memorandum G.T,7843.The situation now appears to be as follows(a) Whilo other countries are rapidly edvancing their High power W/T organisation, no steps have been taken by the British Empire which is falling behind in this respect. ,(b) British Companies are seriously, handicapped in their endeavour to obtain W/T concession in Foreign countries&apos;by tho facts that the British policy as re* garde Imperial f/T is uncertain or unknown to them, and that no stations exist in England with which , such Foreign Stations can communicate and there is no immediate prospect of any suitable stations being erected.   The need for overcoming thia if we are to attract trade and counteract the efforts of,other countries is very pressing,(c) The Empire can ill afford to erect the necessary stations^ The necessity for strict economy has become mere urgent and it is doubtful if proposals for the hoavy expenditure Y/hich would bo entailed will receive support throughout the Empire0   In any caso the negotiations with.Dominione must bo protracted and .  . thus further delay will bo incurred.(d) Ho Government Department exists which can adequately oxercisc tho ownership and control at the proscnt tima and any form of divided control would bo detrimental not only to financial success but also to technical development.     It is not suggested that such a Department should bo formed and even if it wore possible on financial and political grounds it would take some time to sot up tho necessary administration.(o)   Government Departments have not been required to sti?dy Long Distance W/T on the large scale involved and therefore they arc not.in a position to design and plan an Imperial system in detail.(f) On the other hand at least two British w/T firms arc fully prepared- with designs and most anxious to erect and work a system of Imperial YT/T communication, under Government control,   Their readiness is shown by the number of applications for Government support as regards foreign concessions and for other facilities which have been received.(g) Technical developments render it improbable that Lea-field and Cairo as at present designed will take their place in any Imperial System without modification.2.-   While supporting the principle of State Ownership and b-cate Control of Imperial W/T as the. ultimate aim of the^Governmont
the Government, the Admiralty feel that the need for commencingan Imperial w/t Scheme on the broadest $possible basis is so urgent that the delay incurred by adhering to this principle from the outset would be disastrous *59     The Admiralty therefore urge that the following -alternative proposals should be considered by(the Far Cabinet j-(a) a Committee as proposed by Lord Milner to be formed at   Ionoe to co-ordinate the strategic and commercial- 1.-requirements of the Imperial Government as regards w/tm(b) The requirements to be met by causing private enter-prise to erect the necessary stations0   The stations to be worked by private enterprise under Government, ^ontrglo^(c) a representative of commercial w/t to be included in lord Xilner?s Committee,(d) Tho financial arrangements with, such private enter-prise to include terms &quot;which will enable the Imperial   \ Government to take ever entirely any or all the stations if and when the Government so desires.This will be when(i) A Government Department exists which ia equipped technically and otherwise to ran such, a system efficiently and winhout financial loss.(ii) The Empire can afford to finance the undertaking.4.-   The Admiralty further urge that(a) The creation of w/t routes when required $hall not beobstructed on the ground that such will compete with any existing cable routes.(b) Cable routes which are essential for strategic purposesshall be safeguarde&quot;d from financial loss, due to W/T i competition, by Government subsidy and not by keeping the wireless rates at an artificially high level.(o) The actual cables which are essential for strategicpurposes be determined and dealt with as in (b) above and that others which cannot compete with wireless shall not.receive any special consideration, observing that Cable Companies would have the same facilities as w/t companies for obtaining licenses to erect and work w/T stations.5*-   The Admiralty requirements of any Imperial VT/t Scheme are(a) That any ship of the class of Light Cruiser and above shall be able to receive w/T messages where-soever she may be between Lat.60o IT. and 60o S. all round the globe.(b) That W/T communication is assured either, direct or through not more than two linking stations between England and any stations erected to meet (a) above.(intlld)     7,\H,L.15.10.19.
