9 Q 0 , d y 0(THIS DOfltftffSNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS ,&apos;BRITASKX.C (^TOMT,)^SECRET,hit.....83Z2-WAR CABINET.CYPRUS.Note by the President of the Board of Education.It may be assumed that the complete sasa against the cession of Cyprus to Greece has been stated in the two lucid Ataairalty Memoranda, G.T.. 8262 and G.T. 8318, which have-been circulated to the Cabinet, and so far as the arguments contained in these documents are strategical they will carry the weight properly attaching to thn high authority by which they are advanced.   The strategical argument, i.e, that Cyprus is necessary to Grnat Britain as a counterfoil to the French Mandate in Syria, is, however, inextricably interwoven with political considerations and it is to these considerations that I would again invite the attention of my Colleagues.I suggest that it should bo the first principle of our policy, a principle based alike upon considerations of justice and of economy, to insist upon a strict interpretation of the Mandate as it is defined in the League of Rations and I submit . that the cession of Cyprus would enable us to do this with a force to be derived from no other available stroke of fftatooraft, short of the establishment under British advice and protection of an Arab State in Mesopotamia.     If we cede Cyprus to Greece we should be able to say to Italy &quot;You must evacuate Rhodes11, to Greece &quot;Hands off the hinterland of Smyrna&quot; and to France &quot;No naval base at Alexandretta&quot;.     Lot us freely admit that if France in defiance of the In-ague of Nations were to convert her Syrian Mandate into&apos; an aggressivyrailitary enterprise aimed at British interests Cyprus might, after her two miserable harbours had been at great expense made available for the purpose servo as a convenient base against Alexandretta.    Still prevention is bettor than cure, and the important point is to prevent the Governments accepting Mandates from departing from the spirit in which the whole theory of the Mandate is conceived.     I should also imagine that, in the Case of War, the British Fleet, which will always be the strongest fleet in the Mediterranean, would \ bo able to make use of Cyprus as it made use of Corfu, even if it were flying the Groek flag.So far as the wishes of the po my information goes to show that they predominantly Phil-Hellenic As to true that they would object to be han Government, but it would be easy to s the Island should be deferred until 1 the Greek Parliament guaranteeing to cr*il and religious rights and,if ne tor.
