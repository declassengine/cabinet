THIS:,;DO0&apos;UMJ!)NT IS THE PROPFRTY OF HIS BRITANNIC I,AJ1W!S. GOVFRHI^NT). SPCR^T, r&apos;AR CABINFT0G.T.8509,&apos; SHIPPING SITUATION AND TH&apos;r CONGESTION IN TIP DOCKS.Report of Conference held in^Conferenoo Room &quot;A&quot; at 2, T^ite^aIJ.&quot;&quot;Garo.ons f S,^ on&quot; September 19th 1919,1*     I have to report that the Conference of I ministers which mot, in accordance with T,ar Cabinet 622, Minute 7, on September 19th to discuss this question came to the conclusion that the congestion in the ports is due to a grort ertent to the folio?;rng causes(1)     Owing to a lack of storage accommodation the lighters and transit sheda in the docks which are necessary for the quick handling of traffic are being used both by Government Departments and trad- rs for storage purposes. (2)     Private cartage from railwcy terminals, being nolonger remunerative owing to the small margin payable out of the present railway rates, has ceased.     In consequence the railway terminals are congested end the Railway Companies are obliged to block the traffic back at the ports which adds to the congestion there. (3)    Rolling stock is held up owing to the failure ofconsignees of Government Departments and private traders to take delivery promptly. (4)     The general dislocation of trade which is partly due to Government control and Government purchases contributes materially to the congestion, 2.    The Conference recommend to tho *far Cabinet -(a)     that the ministry of Shipping in consultation with the Ministry of Transport should have authority to block Government traffio at the port of shipment in cases where they are satisfied that the import would
add to or cause contention due to lack of storage accommodation in&apos;this country,     Departments importing goods on Government account to &quot;be required to a no1/ to the l&apos;inir,try of Transport how they propose to store the goods in this country before shipping facilities are arranged,(b) That the Storayc Committee of the hiniatry of Reconstruction should in future act ao a clearing house for the allocation of storage in the hands of Government Departments other than in ports and should make recommendations as to the beat use of available accommodation^(c) That the Storage Committee he transferred to the.ministry of Transport-, 3*     The Conference decided to request the Storage Committee to prepare a census based on reeorts in tabular form from all Government Departments an to (a) all &quot;^remises; suitable for use as storage which have been temporarily acquired by each Department,  (b) the purposes for which they are used, 4.     The Conference desire me to direct tho attention of the Cabinet to the fact that the Port and Transit Committee while In theory in supreme control of accommodation at the Docks, has no means of compelling Government Departments to r e 1 inqi i i s h a t or a g e a c c ommo d a 11 on*5.     The Conference desired to record their opinion that -(a) Congestion of traffic could not he completely proven-ted so long as the imports of important commodities are under the control of Government Departments, and that a return&apos;to normal conditions whereby such imports arc in the hands of private traders is essential to a permanent solution of the problem.(b) In ordmr to release storage and circulate stores and materials mithout delay, all Government stores in the United Kingdom, and in every theatre of war and at all ports whatsoever, should.be declared surplus forthwith,
and sold as soon as possible, excepting only sufficient to provide Tor the peace tine requirements of the fisjhtlnrj services , and such duly authorised reserves \ as prudence may require in the interests of safetyj(I such requirements and reserves to be declared by the1 i&apos;;&apos; em,,. -&apos; -&quot;-y &apos; e-.&apos;.: &apos;&quot;&apos;.&quot;e     hhV&apos;  ,      eI Departments concerned within a reasonable time to bei.     &apos; -I laid down by the Cabinet.   One month is sunseated.. The Disposal Board should effect sales even at reduced prices, rather than hold out for better results entailing the retention of storage accommodation urgently required, for the commerce of the country. 6*    The question of the transfer of motor lorries from the Surplus Disposal Board to the Railway Executive Comrdttee&apos; for the purpose of delivering moods to and from rail&apos;-ay terminals and the extent to &quot;-hick, lorries can be used for the bulk conveyance of short distance traffic is beine investigated by the Tinistry of Transport, and a further report rill be circulated as soon as the information is available.(Sd)   Eric Geddes.6, &quot;&quot;hitehall Gardens, S-loth October 1919.
