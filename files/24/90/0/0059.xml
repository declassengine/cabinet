Memorandum by the S.of S, for far.The statement of comparative &quot;running expenses&quot; of Cars in G,T. 7970 contains a figure of  875 for War Office Cars,This figure appears to be taken by dividing by four the figure of  3,500 given in a Memorandum of the Secretary of State for War in regard to cars allotted to civilians in the War Office.This figure of  3,500 is not however a figure of &quot;running expenses&quot;.   It represents the gross benefit which would accrue per annum to the British Government if the particular service were to be discontinued and these individual cars were to be declared surplus at the date in question, and includes the interest on the then selling price, depreciation at 20^ per aiamum (to cover the difference in selling value at the then high pricesprevailing and what would it is estimated be obtained 12 months later if the cars were retained for 12 months and other similar items.)The actual running expenses of a War Department car on the assumption of a running of 10,000 miles per annum varies from  o04 in the case of a Rolls aoyce tc  237 in the case of a Sunbeam, Vauxhall or similar make of car, exclusive of the cost of the driver (pay, rations, etc. ,) which is fixed by the pay warrant.   It is regretted that the return originally given should have led to this misunderstanding; but it was not recognised when the return was sent in that it was required for the purposes of working out comparative costs.   It has been found that for thi-s purpose a detailed statement showing the items included and the mileage basis is essential, if any useful conclusion is to be reached.All the been abolished.17th October, 1919.cars mentioned in this return have since(Sgd)     W.
