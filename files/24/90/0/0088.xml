The Conditions of Inceeased Output.Production at its present level is not furnishing supplies on a scale commensurate with current demands, and this fact has its reflex in rising prices. Until there is fair prospect of stable prices and wages, labour cannot begin to think and negotiate on a. definite basis, and manufacturers cannot well undertake long-term contracts or make arrangements ahead. There is a widespread demand for the stabilisation of wages, but there can be no stabilisation of wages unless prices become stable also. At the moment prices are rising and they will continue to rise until such time as the volume of goods produced and services rendered equals the purchasing power exerted by the public as a whole. One way to stabilise prices would be to curtail purchasing power by depressing incomes or earnings. That way, however, is beset with difficulties. Organised workers, will not submit without violent protest to any reduction of money rates. To pay unorganised workers less than they now receive would be to drive them below the poverty line. The salaried workers and professional men could hardly stand a reduction in money on the top of the depreciation of money values.  There can be no immediate reduction(c 1905) 25S 10/19 H &amp; S 3  
in the  400,000,000 a year which must be paid as interest on the National Debt. Because , of these great blocks of population, as regards which there can be no question of present reduction in money received, no manipulation cf the currency will serve to bring down prices. There are in fact only three ways of holding prices steady : (a) curtailing the purchasing power of all classes, especially the wealthier, by heavier taxation ; (b) reducing the income of manufacturers, traders and retailers by preventing &quot; profiteering &quot; ; (c) securing an increased output of socially useful goods and services. The present article will be confined to the third course. It is proposed to mention briefly the causes of flagging production and then to set forth some essential conditions of recovery; but it will be understood that output, taxation and the prevention of &quot; profiteering &quot; are closely interdependent.An examination of the present state of industry shows that the causes of low production come under two categories. In the first place-there are obstacles, delays and dislocation for which the manual worker is not responsible ; in the second place workmen (as also employers) are subject to ideas, feelings and influences which are leading them to &quot; go easy &quot; or &quot; hold back &quot; rather than to work at top notch. The first class of obstacle can be removed by the better organisation ; the second calls for a straightening out of ideas and an alteration of mood and temper.Among the circumstances in part responsible for low efficiency of production are shortage and inferiority of material, deterioration of plant, inadequacy of equipment, the disjointed state of works-administration and routine due to the turnover from war to peace conditions, the hesitations due to trade having taken unfamiliar channels, the difficulties and delays of transport, and the fact that in most firms new people have been taken on who have to learn the run of the shop, or former employees who are more or less out of practice have been reinstated. These are transition difficulties which will pass in due course, but a more serious legacy of the war is that the conduct of manufacturing businesses has become more slapdash than hitherto. When in times of keen competition 1 or 2 per cent, up or down meant the difference between getting or losing the orders, between full work and unemployment, sheer necessity compelled forceful and watchful administration. To-day in some lines of business the employer seems able to get what price he likes to ask and it is natural that employers and men alike should slack of! in such circumstances. . This condition accentuates that very natural &quot; tired feeling &quot; which follows upon several years of overtime in munition industries or hard unsettling years in the Services; The circumstances referred to above are due to the war, and constitute additions to the long-standing obstacles to the maximisation of output, such as the practice among piece-workers of not doing more than the &quot; tally &quot; lest prices should be cut, and the practice, particularly in contract work, of going slow to make the job last out. These have become minor factors in the general falling off, but they are still of sufficient importance to warrant a thorough examination of the problems involved, with a view to arriving at some general principle whereby the fear of price-cutting and standing off between jobs can be obviated. The removal of the causes of interruptions and delays in the passage of industrial material from the raw to the finished state is a matter in which the Government can give and is giving assistance.Apart, however, from material obstacles to increasing production, there is noticeably lacking that&quot; will to produce &quot; which must always be the mainspring of industrial activity. All who have followed the reception of exhortations to the manual workers to produce without stint must have noticed in the working class psychology of the time not merely an apathy in production but a deadweight of resistance to any suggestion that output should be increased. Since the measure of output rests very largely though not wholly in the hands of the workpeople, it is necessary to ask whence it arises in order that such appeals as it is deemed desirable to make shall be framed in such terms as to command response.It is desirable, first, to recognise that the prevailing slackness is not a result of the leaders or officials of organised labour having issued instructions to the rank and file to go easy. Therefore remarks directed towards securing a change in central trade union policy are beside the point. It is rather a result of a widespread sourness of mind among the rank and file of labour, which is due partly to the disappointment in regard to hopes raised during the war, partly to the very general feeling that all is not well with the world they had hitherto taken for granted. The very nobility of the purposes for which men laboured in the war militates against their acceptance of meaner or vaguer purposes for their labour now. They ask What for ? This results in the doctrine of labour intellectuals who interpret the prevailing discontent in the terms of criticism of the present order and the prevailing hopes in the terms of a new social order. These doctrines probably do not directly influence the output of the mass of working people; probably not One in a hundred consciously
slacks as a protest against the ill distribution of wealth, or revolt against production for profit. It is doubtful if any average worker would work a stroke harder in nationalised than in a privately owned industry, but the mass of workers are influenced indirectly to some extent in that some of their leaders counter any appeal for increased output by indignant references to these things and the indignation they feel is real. Thus, while the, ordinary working man may not imbibe a doctrine, his general discontent is canalised into resentment against any suggestion that output should be increased.For these reasons it is essential that any appeal for increased production should be addressed not only to the working classes but equally to employers and to all other sections of the community who may be deemed to obstruct production, and that the appeal should take cognisance of the ideas which are at the root of the prevailing slackness in regard to output.At the recent Trades Union Congress, it will be remembered, the need for greater output was discussed. Mr. Brownlie&apos;s letter roused some resentment and, among others, Mr. Ben Turner expressed the idea prevailing at the Congress that the workers should not be singled out for exhortation while other classes idled or lived on their profits. Again, the discussion showed that the appeal of Mr. Brownlie was discounted because it was believed to come from a suspected source the representatives of those who draw the chief benefit from things as they are : and an appeal can hardly be effective if the authority on which it is made is already discredited among those to whom the appeal is made. Evidently, therefore, the appeal for output must be directed to all classes if it is to be effective with any. This alone would tend to show that it was not made in the interests of one class. The appeals made by the Government during the war were not exhortations to a selected class, and their effectiveness was in part due to the fact that they touched all citizens equally.  A similarly general appeal can now be made.Secondly, in regard to the prevailing ideas in labour circles, &quot; labour&apos;.&apos; cannot - be treated as a mere congeries of individuals, each free to respond to the incitements of a poster. Labour is now an organised class and the mass-psychology of the organisation must be moved before any change in the policy is effected. The ideas now dominating the mass therefore cannot be neglected. These ideas have been formulated in the doctrines that (1) the more the working class produce, the more the &quot; idle rich &quot; will waste ; that (2) a man cannot work his best in a system run for private profit; and that (3) the land-owners and capitalists should loose their stranglehold on land and money before they begin to lecture labour on restricting production. Such doctrines must be faced. They are not simply &quot; economics,&quot; they are the formulae of deep-rooted suspicion and discontent.. Not disproof is needed but discussion and drastic action.It appears essential first for the speeding up of necessary production that the ex-penditure on luxuries should be restricted. Arguments to show that the rich are not idle are less effective for increasing the supply of necessaries than the deliberate regulation of wasteful, expensive and unproductive goods and services. The need for drastic action is like that of war-time, for the sense of the waste of labour prevents the devotion of energy to what labour produces. Again, &quot; the system run for private profit&quot; may be an abusive description of the existing order, but it can be countered only by definite action in regard to profits. In this matter the Government have already shown in the Profiteering Act its understanding of the fact that the mood of labour cannot be changed until labour sees some signs that &quot; profits &quot; are drastically regulated. And finally, the doctrine that &quot; capitalists restrict production &quot; is receiving confirmation in the perhaps natural delay in taking up orders, the lack of energy which is believed to be shown by the employing classes and the records of the advantage taken by capital of the prevailing lack of goods. The only effective reply to the belief in capitalist restriction, is the demonstration that no class is hanging back while others are being exhorted to work, and that no class will, monopolise the surplus gains of increased effort.The conclusion which must inevitably be drawn is that a frank and free discussion will best promote the spirit upon which alone the increase of output depends ; and this discussion might well be the most urgent task of Joint Industrial Councils and other joint bodies. Exhortations will not do ; economic arguments are beside the point. The facts must be on the table and the employers must not be believed to understand best the meaning of those facts which it should be their duty to produce. The Prime Minister, at the first meeting of the Industrial Conference some time ago, advocated publicity as the essential for further progress, and nothing is more urgently needed at present in order to restore confidence and destroy the suspicions which are delaying the increase in the production of necessary goods.(C 1905)3 B 2
Part II.-Departmental.The Resettlement of Disabled Men.The programme of the Ministry of Labour for the resettlement of disabled men falls into two complementary divisions. On the one hand, the efforts of the Employment Exchanges to provide direct employment have been supplemented by the launching of the National Scheme for the employment of disabled men on a percentage basis. On the other hand, the training programme of the Ministry provides for the ultimate employ-ment of disabled men in skilled occupations. The two schemes are, of course, not mutually exclusive. The employment obtained under the National Scheme will, for the most part, be of a skilled or semi-skilled nature, but acceptance of this work is not intended to debar the man from obtaining training in a skilled occupation at a later date. Con-adversely, the employer who will accept a trained man, or who has disabled men under training in his business, is entitled to include these workers in the calculation of the percentage required under the National Scheme.The progress of the National Scheme was unfortunately interrupted by the distraction of interest caused by the railway strike, and the larger and more important firms naturally required some little time for the consideration of ways and means before they could offer the required undertaking. While progress under these circumstances has so far been slow, there are encouraging suggestions of a possible acceleration in the near future. Up to the 17th October, the number of employers whose undertakings under the scheme has been accepted as satisfactory by the Local Employment Committees was about 3,940, but of these some 2,490 were accepted in the last fortnight of the period. The actual reduction in the live register of disabled men consequent upon these undertakings is difficult at present to measure. Although of the first 3,000 firms who have qualified for admission to the National Roll about 2,250 are already employing their full quota of disabled men, it is known that in many cases the engagements of these men have been recent. The first 3,000 firms will need to engage about 1,070 additional men to carry out their undertaking. Some difficulty has been occasioned by the fact that a number of firms have formed the mistaken idea that they can satisfy the requirements of the scheme by a percentage employment of disabled men calculated not on their total employees, but on their male staff. Steps have been taken through the Press to correct this impression and to revive the general interest of employers in the scheme. The inclusion in the list of firms of a growing number of the most important undertakings in the country and of many public bodies and authorities is a hopeful sign for the future.The development of training courses for disabled men, despite the difficulties in the adjustment of trade interests and the provision of accommodation and equip-ment, continues on the whole satisfactory, although the existence in many parts of the country of waiting lists of some size shows that a good deal of headway must still be made to complete the work. The rate of progress has, however, been accelerated, some 24 training schemes being sanctioned during the single month of September. The development of the system of Government Instructional Factories will, it is hoped, do much to solve the problem by providing facilities on a large scale for training. Thus, during September, Treasury sanction has been obtained for the purchase of a factory at Shepherd&apos;s Bush which will accommodate about 400 men for training in the furniture and vehicle building trades. The transfer from the Ministry of &quot;Munitions to the Ministry of Labour of the Albert Factory, Cathoart, should do much to meet the urgent demand for training facilities in Scotland and to help with the solution of the housing problem. The factory will provide accommodation for from 1,500 to 2,000 trainees in the building and other trades. A factory has been acquired at Cardiff wThich mil accommodate 700 men training in the furniture, vehicle building and building trades. The National Ordnance Factory at New Basford will provide training in the Midlands for about 600 men in building, electrical contracting, boot and shoe making, jewellery and silversmithing, tailoring and furniture making ; while the acquisition of part of the National Projectile Factory&apos; at Hackney Marshes will allow of the training of about 450 men in the electrical and engineering trades. It is hoped that the position in Essex, where the number of men awaiting training is very considerable, may be met by the establishment of a large training centre at the National Projectile Factory, Ponders End. This factory will also afford relief to Middlesex.One of the most interesting forms of training is that given in diamond cutting and polishing, an industry new to this country. Three centres are in full operation, at Brighton, Cambridge and Fort William, and about 486 men are in training at the moment. A fourth centre will shortly be opened at Wrexham, where hostel arrangements alone Temain to be completed ; and a fifth course at Bournemouth has recently been sanctioned.
345^Consideration is being given to the question of still further extending the provision of training in this industry, the possible limitations of which are at present under discussion with the Board of. Trade. Another interesting scheme has recently been established in -connection with the Northern Polytechnic, Holloway, which provides for the instruction of about 120 men in various processes of the musical instruments trade, including pianoforte manufacture, tuning and repairing.The difficulties occasioned by the transfer of men under training to a new scale of allowances have been surmounted. Apart from the questions of accommodation and equipment, the most important outstanding difficulty arises from the recent decision of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers not to co-operate with the Government in the scheme for training disabled men. Although the Society have hitherto been represented on the National Trade Advisory Committee for Shipbuilding and Engineering, local difficulties have been encountered for some time past in placing men who have received engineering training in technical institutions and are awaiting workshop training under the scheme. The adverse vote of the Society was, however, the result of a ballot representing only a small proportion of the total membership, and informal discussions have already taken place with representatives of the executive which it is hoped will lead to the attainment of a more satisfactory position.Paet TIL-Press Comments. &apos; (1) The Labour ami Socialist Press. (A) Foreign Affairs.-Russia.Russia excites the interest of the Labour and Socialist Press for two reasons : firstly, this Press is especially interested in the policy the British Government adopts towards Hussia, as it believes such policy may illustrate the general attitude of the Government towards Socialism; secondly, the actual course of the Bolshevist experiment is followed in order that all possible advantage may be taken of the lessons it may teach to the ^Socialist movement generally. From the first point of view there is little discussion in this week&apos;s papers, with the exception of an appeal from the &quot; New Statesman &quot; for a iull and frank declaration of policy on the part of the Government, and an article in the &quot; Nation &quot; on the German forces in the Baltic Provinces. With regard to the second aspect of discussions on Russia, the &quot; Nation&quot; and the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; devote -articles to the analysis of Mr. Bullitt&apos;s evidence to the U.S.A. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations ; and M. Issaiev contributes articles on the internal policy of the Bolshevists to &quot; Justice &quot; and the &quot; Democrat.&quot;League of Nations.In referring to the meeting at the Mansion House on the 13th inst., some of the papers take the opportunity to express their attitude towards the League. The &quot; Nation &quot; is despondent, and says that if the League is to consolidate the policy and power of the -Governments that have created it, it will be much more than useless : it will be a public danger. If, however, two or three Socialist Governments could find representation on the League, the paper thinks that it might then come to bear some resemblance to the visions of President Wilson. The &quot; Labour Leader .&quot; and the &quot; Worker &quot; despair of any good emanating from, the League. In the words of the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; &apos;: The &apos; League of Nations&apos; Covenant is devised to perpetuate the old foreign policy and to enforce the will of the strong upon the weak. It is the instrument of aggression and will provoke wars.&quot; In the opinion of the &quot; Worker,&quot; &quot; with the attack on Russia and the suppression of Ireland, to talk of a League-to safeguard the right of nationality, is so much rubbish.&quot;Other. - .The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; contains an article describing the conditions in Vienna, ;An article in the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; describes the &quot; White Terror &quot; in Hungary:-  j (B) Home Affairs.Reflections on the Railway Strike. .The railway strike continues to excite considerable notice in the weekly Press, with the exception of the LLP. papers, which concentrate rather upon the question of the nationalisation of the mines.   &quot; Forward,&quot; however, contains several belated opinions. &quot; Rob Roy &quot; in this paper expresses the opinion that both the Government and the/.....^TiwnwiffiiTirrrrnniiiiyii iii iin ......nniiHyiinin...........*......M.......
railwaymen will have emerged from the recent struggle with increased respect for each other&apos;s prowess. He discusses the two extremist explanations of the strike as either an &quot; Anarchist conspiracy &quot; or else a capitalist conspiracy engineered by the Govern-ment. He does not think that either of these two explanations is true. On the whole,, he believes, two main facts stand out prominently as the lessons of the strike. Neutral public opinion and aggressive capitalism alike will have learned that organised labour will stand shoulder to shoulder against any degradation of the present standard of living amongst its members. On the other hand, organised labour has had a sharp reminder that it is not very easy to hold up a society like ours, at however vital a spot the blow may be aimed. In addition to these lessons, he gives his opinion that no lesson may be drawn from the strike as to the desirability or practicability of the policy of nationalisation.. In the same paper, Sir Leo Chiozza Money takes as his text three sayings attributed to the Prime Minister, and drafts in accordance with them a programme for the railwaymen.. This programme includes complete nationalisation of the railways, the active association of the workers in the conduct of the industry, the proper co-ordination of the entire railway system in relation to canals, roads and coastal shipping, and an entire revision of passenger and freight rates in a downward direction. Colonel Wedgwood, M.P., also in this paper, reviews the policy of the Government towards Trade Unions, and concludes that the Government to-day is fighting trade unions as bitterly as Lord LiverpooPs Government was fighting them 100 years ago. &quot; In the interests of the community Mr. Lloyd George has declared a &apos; class war.&apos; &quot; Colonel Wedgwood appeals to the country,, if it does not want to see itself in the throes of a &quot; class war,&quot; to return a strong Labour majority at the next Election, &quot; so that the workers could be fully represented in the next Government.&quot; In &quot; Justice,&quot; Mr. H. M. Hyndman expresses the opinion that we are clearly on the eve of a desperate struggle between the mass of the people and the minority of landlords and capitalists. He firmly believes that first collective, and then social-democratic, ownership and administration are the inevitable outcome of the existing stage of economic development, and therefore he takes counsel as to how this great social transformation can be peacefully and beneficially brought about. The conclusion he-arrives at is that it is an urgent necessity for the railways to be immediately nationalised,. and he devotes the main part of his article to proving that such nationalisation would, in itself be advisable..The week following the railway strike was notable for the number of opinions that appeared in the daily papers from responsible Labour leaders as to the desirability of a reorganisation of the Labour movement and the establishment of some organisation in the way of a Labour &quot; general staff.&quot;  These proposals do not seem to have excited much attention in I.L.P. circles.   The I.L.P. papers have consistently in the last three-weeks taken the standpoint that the railway strike showed the need for strong political action on the part of trade unionists, and this week have devoted themselves similarly to the political aspects of the mines nationalisation movement.  The &quot; general staff&quot; idea is, however, discussed in the more extreme weekly papers &quot; The Call,&quot; &quot; The Socialist &quot; and the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; ; while the &quot; New Statesman &quot; analyses the meaning of the phrase, and discusses the implications involved in it.  Mr. J. T. Murphy contributes an article to the &quot; Socialist&quot; in which he expresses a general opinion as to the &quot; mag-nificence &quot; of the railway strike, but complains that Mr. Thomas refused his consent to* the transport workers and others joining the strike and making it general, and also of the action of the so-called fourteen mediators in securing a settlement of the strike.  &quot; What-ever the railwaymen have gained, they have gained by the strike weapon ; what they failed to get has been lost because they had Parliamentarian leaders who feared to extend the strike since they all had an eye on Parliament.&quot;  This being the opinion of Mr.. Murphy, the editorial opinion of the &quot; Socialist&quot; is not surprising.   In a leading article this paper acknowledges that there is a lack of co-ordination in Labour&apos;s forces, but fears that a general staff made up on the lines of the fourteen mediators would be a source of&quot; weakness to the movement rather than of strength.   This paper appeals, in preference to a &quot;general staff,&quot; for a strong rank and file movement.  A substantially similar opinion is expressed in &quot; The Call &quot; by Mr. W. McLaine.   &quot;A&apos; general staff&apos; by all means,. but it must be drawn directly from the rank and file.&quot;  Mr. McLaine believes (in direct contradiction to &quot; Eob Roy &quot;) that the victory of the railwaymen lies in the fact that they have shown the impotence of the Government to defeat a body of workers &quot; strong enough to do more than merely wait and starve.&quot;  The &quot; general staff &quot; proposal is discussed in more detail in this paper by Mr. Tom Quelch, who bases his reasoning upon the assumption that a strike of the workers in any of the vital industries assumes the aspect of &quot; Civil War.&quot;  He urges that the capitalists and the Government have no illusion about this and urges upon the trade union movement to recognise that it is an Army.  He states.
that the Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congress is a &quot; relic of the dead ages &quot; and unable to meet the demand that there should be a complete central reorganisa-tion of the Trade Union Movement. He then proceeds to quote an article of his published in&quot; The Call &quot; of 24th April in which he advocated the formation of a central authority which would act firstly as a &quot;general staff &quot; for all the forces of labour, and secondly as a shadow Government &quot; &quot; conducting the proletarian struggles of to-day and preparing for the dictatorship of the workers to-morrow.&quot; An article in the &quot;Workers&apos; Dread-nought,&quot; which professes to deal with the moral that may be drawn from the railway strike, does not put forward any positive proposals, but merely repeats negative com-&apos; plaints that the organisation of the Triple Alliance was not made use of in the strike.The &quot; New Statesman &quot; agrees that a further co-ordination of the trade union forces is urgently required, but insists that a &quot; general staff &quot; in the military sense would not be accepted by the labour movement. Taking the proposal, however, to mean the formation of a strong and representative co-ordinating body in order that each section of the movement may be kept fully informed in advance of what the other sections are doing, and in Order that, in times of crisis, the collective opinion of the whole labour movement may be brought effectively to bear, the &quot; New Statesman &quot; is favourable to the scheme. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; thinks it necessary, however, to insist that the general public need not fear the formation of such a &quot; general staff &quot; and develops an argument that the &quot; general staff &quot; Would be a positive element in promoting industrial peace . Therefore, the conclusion of this paper is that a committee, clearly understanding its purpose and functions and not desiring to secure &quot; power &quot; to do what it could achieve by using influence and spreading information, is needed to provide machinery of co-ordination in the interests of industrial peace, and would not involve the labour movement in any of the perils of mass action and control. The main point, perhaps, upon which the &apos;&quot; New Statesman &quot; insists is that it Would not be the &quot; powers &quot; but the prestige and the weli-informed character of such a body that would determine its effectiveness. The &quot; New Age &quot; criticises the views put forward in such papers as &quot; The Call &quot; with regard to the advisability of a general strike, and expresses the opinion that the real victory of the Government lies in the dispersion of the threatening myth of a general strike. With regard to the &quot; general staff &quot; scheme, the &quot; New Age &quot; thinks that a more urgent matter is the reform of the Trade Union Congress itself and its Parliamentary Committee. The &quot; New Age &quot; hints that it would be advisable, indeed, for the Trade Union movement to reconsider its policy of pressing for advances in money wages and to begin to consider the &apos; question of prices.The &quot; Railway Review &quot; devotes its attention to proving that if the railway strike was the result of- a conspiracy, it was a conspiracy on the part of the Government rather than on the part of the N.U.R.In the Merthyr &quot; Pioneer &quot; Mr. Jowett develops in detail the facts which support the view expressed by the &quot; Worker,&quot; and Mr. W. Stewart, in &quot; Forward,&quot; last week, that it was financial pressure on the Government that induced the Prime Minister to settle the strike.Goal Mines Nationalisation.&apos; The deputation to the Prime Minister from the Parliamentary Committee of. the Trade Union Congress and the Executive of the M.F.G.B. attracts the particular attention of the I.L.P. papers. Their articles go to show that it is their wish that the mines nationalisation question should become a purely political issue, and that the I.L.P. should take a leading part in winning for the miners nationalisation.Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; expresses the opinion that the uncom-promising reply of the Prime Minister to the trade union deputation is a challenge to the whole labour movement, and that a determined struggle between the trade unions and the Government cannot be averted. He does not think that a special Trade Union Congress will be able to go back on the practically unanimous decision of the Glasgow Congress to press, by all means within the power of the Labour movement, for the nationalisation of the mines. Mr. Snowden, however, congratulates the Parliamentary Committee and the Miners&apos; Federation on the educational campaign they are instituting. He thinks it a wise decision, in view of his opinion that the question of the nationalisation of the mines is not a matter to be decided by direct action, but by the whole community in ordinary political and constitutional ways. A leading article in the same paper repeats Mr. Snowden&apos;s opinion that the Prime Minister^ decision is a declaration of war upon the Labour movement. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; is pleased with this decision, as it shows that the Prime Minister has decided not to have anything to do with the Labour pro-. gramme of nationalisation.   &quot; The progressive movement is well rid of this political
charlatan.&quot; The opinion is expressed that the Prime Minister intends to rush another. General Election on an unprepared electorate. The Independent Labour Party is exhorted.to take its rightful part in the campaign for the nationalisation of the mines, but -also to widen the issue beyond, this specific demand to educate the community in the whole Socialist programme of social ownership and control of all public services. The oft-repeated . opinion is again expressed that the success of the Socialist programme is inevitable. The &quot; Socialist&quot; draws from the interview with the Prime Minister the conclusion that Royal Commissions in general, and the Coal Industry. Commission in particular, are tactical methods in the class war by which the Government gains time. The opinion is expressed that the miners should, have pressed their claim in March when, the railwaymen also had the Government in a tight corner. The l( Socialist&quot; is not confident that the reference of the whole matter to a, special Trade Union Congress will be of much value, and suggests that a forcing of the Government^ hand by the. miners-might be the best means of awakening the other trades to a. sense of their responsibility.. A somewhat similar attitude is taken up by the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; which is not surprised at this result of the Coal Commission^ labours, but complains of the time and money which was thus wasted in order &quot; to preserve a semblance of industrial peace.&quot; &quot; The Call&quot; views the reply to the deputation, when considered with the railway strike, as showing that the attitude of the Government and the &quot;capitalist classes&apos;&quot;. is now clearly revealed. &quot; It is one of hostility to the demands and aspirations of Labour to change the industrial system from one of private profit-making to one of national owner-ship.&quot; No hint is given in this paper, however, as to how this issue should be decided, but every confidence is expressed in the future. The &quot; New Age &quot; is despondent. This paper agrees with the Prime Minister that no time could be less opportune for either the demand or the threat of the miners, and avers that on the issue of nationalisation the electorate would never return a.Labour Government. In the &quot;Clarion,&quot; Mr. A. M., Thompson suggests that the nationalisation question should be settled by a &quot; plain referendum.&quot; The &quot; British Citizen &quot; welcomes the spirit of responsibility and con-stitutionalism which the Miners&apos; Federation are showing. An educational campaign, thinks this paper, is not only the legitimate, but the sanest means which the miners could adopt. The Government, however, is supported in its refusal &quot; to add to the burden of the community by nationalising the mines.&quot;Political Outlook.With the opening of the Autumn session, the Labour papers take the opportunity to review the political situation and state their policies. In &quot; Forward &quot; Mr. Ramsay Macdonald discusses the issues on which the Labour Party should challenge the Govern-ment. He is disappointed that so many Labour members are going to Washington,, and appeals to them to stay at Westminster, where they must support a vigorous Parlia-mentary polic)^ and cease to hold all friendly relations with the Government. He thinks, that the Party should immediately ask for a discussion on the railway strike and demand the resignation of Sir Eric Geddes. It should call attention to the Governments foreign policy by means of a vote of censure. Mr. Macdonald does not believe that industrial policy can be separated from political; and therefore thinks that if a strike takes place involving political ideas and dealing with Labour&apos;s relation to the Government, political representatives cannot be left off a &quot; Negotiating Committee &quot; and that the Labour Party should be consulted at every stage. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; everywhere attacks the Prime Minister. Sir Leo Chiozza Money maintains in this paper that he is the stoutest bulwark and ablest defender of the vested interests. In another place this paper deduces from a hint dropped by Mr. Lloyd George in his speech to the Trade Union deputation on nationalisation, that he may take a General Election on that issue, and the opinion is expressed that his motive will be the hope of obscuring the &quot; abominable record of his Government.&quot;The &quot; Socialist&quot; discusses the dilemma which confronts the I.L.P. owing to its opposition to violence. According to the &quot; Socialist&quot; the I.L.P. believes that revolution means bloodshed, and this prevents it from adopting the cause of revolutionary socialism whole-heartedly. Although the &quot; Socialist &quot; itself anticipates that violence will accompany the revolution, it is convinced that this might be avoided if the doctrines of &quot; class-con-consious Socialism &quot; were successfully propagated. The I.L.P. is blamed for doing so little to obviate the violence it abhors by carrying on real educational work, by which the paper presumably means education on a Marxian basis. A manifesto of the British Socialist-Party in the &quot; Call &quot; urges the workers to maintain the magnificent class solidarity displayed during the railway strike, and warns them that the capitalists will attack again when occasion, offers in spite of.the honeyed words of the capitalist press.   In the &quot;British.
Citizen &quot; the National Democratic Party demies its position. It considers itself the influencing factor in the Coalition which voices the aspirations of Labour.Other.In an article entitled &quot; The Employer of To-morrow,&quot; the &quot; New Statesman &quot; argues that, as the status of the wage-earner has changed and is changing, so must that of the employer change. The private employer, it is predicted, will continue to survive in the great bulk of ordinary manufacturing businesses. &apos; Where he exists, he must no longer assume a superiority in social status over the wage-earner, nor look upon his business as his own property, but must regard all who work for him as &quot; partners in the concern,&quot; and himself as rendering a public service. Thus, if business is more and more to be deemed a service to the community, the employer will be tested and esteemed, not in proportion to his income but to his output. The paper considers that, in order to establish the right attitude between the &quot; partners,&quot; the employer should no&apos; longer decide the rate of wages in his own factory, but leave this function to the Trade Unions the Wages Boards, &amp;c, to whose province it is already being recognised to belong.The problem of the high cost of living is discussed in several papers. The &quot; Democrat &quot; attributes it to the shortage of goods, while &quot;Forward &quot; adds, as another important cause, the struggle to evade war taxes. &quot; Justice &quot; scorns the argument of Sir Auckland Geddes that we can only improve the trade situation by increasing exports, and argues that the best way would be to produce more food at home. This course, however, thinks this paper, would necessitate the nationalisation of the land. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; refers to the movement in favour of taxation of capital and draws attention to the German experiment in that direction. The &quot; Nation &quot; criticises the Governments method in carrying out the Profiteering Act. It argues that the serious offenders are the wholesalers and manufacturers, and complains that in spite of this, Sir Auckland Geddes apparently believes in the stimulating effects of high profits and takes no steps to investigate the question.Mr. Joseph King, in the&quot; Bradford Pioneer,&quot; declares that Labour would be content to work for less money if it saw that profiteers were being attacked by great increases of taxation, if taxes on necessaries were reduced and if prices fell. The Government must make it obvious to the workers that it is genuinely trying to bring about more equality in the conditions of life.(2) Ex-Service Men&apos;s Periodicals.The &quot; Ex-Service Man &quot; contains a strong plea for the release of all military offenders. In another article the need for increased production is again emphasised.(3) The Press on Demobilisation and Resettlement.Nil.Part IV. General Topics.National Industrial Conference.The trade union side of the Provisional Joint Committee of the National Industrial Conference met on the 16th inst., and considered, along with other topics, the attitude of the Government towards the exclusion of agriculture from the scope of the 48-hours Bill. It registered its disapproval of the Government^ determination to persist in its decision to exclude agriculture, but agreed to accept an invitation to discuss the matter with the Minister of Labour on the 21st inst. At this Conference a full and frank inter-change of views took place with regard to the question of the exclusion of certain classes of workers, in particular (a) agricultural workers, (6) sea-going workers, (c) Workers in positions of special responsibility, and (d) the police. The trade union side will consider the position further, and it is understood that it intends to approach the employers&apos; side of the Joint Committee with a view to convening an early meeting to discuss the situation.Railwaymen and Co-operation.A letter addressed by Mr. W. T. A. Foot, secretary of the London District Council of the N.U.R., who organised the Central Strike Executive Committee during the recent strike, to N.U.R. branches, contains some interesting statements.   In this letter he offers(C J 905)3C
&quot; a few suggestions as to what should be done before another railway strike takes place,&quot; and concludes by remarking, &quot; We haven&apos;t finished with railway strikes, the one just ended is but the first round of the battle for the emancipation of the railway workers.&quot; Mr. Foot also refers to the fact that the question of the food supply of strikers was dealt with by the London Joint Advisory Council of trade unionists and co-operators. He states that if the strike had lasted a few days longer, they would have had all the branches grouped according to the different co-operative societies&apos; areas and the necessary financial guarantees fixed up ; and suggests that the Council might make plans so that immediately another strike takes place a scheme can be brought into immediate operation. Mr. Foofs letter gives the general impression that he regards the settlement as merely an armistice, at the end of which hostilities will be resumed.In connection with the question,of co-operation between trade unionists and co-operative societies, it may be recalled that the London Joint Advisory Council of Trade Unionists and Co-operators was set up in February, 1919. It is one of the local Advisory Councils established by the National Joint Advisory Council of Trade Unionists and Co-operators, which was formed in accordance with resolutions passed two years ago in the Trade Union and Co-operative Congresses. The function of this Council was to consider to what extent mutual aid between trade unions and co-operative societies was possible. Co-operative societies Avere to be asked to maintain good conditions of employ-ment and to extend assistance to trade unions in case of strikes or lock-outs ; trade unions were to be asked to invest their funds in co-operative producing enterprises, to bank with the C.W.S. Bank, and to permit their members to remain in co-operative employ in case of general strikes. A considerable extension of this movement of co-operation may be expected, and its results will be of far-reaching importance.Miners.A special delegate conference of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain was held on the 22nd October. The two main subjects discussed were the income-tax exemption level and the payment of afternoon and night shifts and week-end work, and of overtime for surface workers and continuous shift men. In connection with the question of income tax, the S.W.M.F. withheld, but did not withdraw, a motion of which it had given notice, that miners should refuse to pay further income tax upon the present basis from the 5th April, 1919. The Conference unanimously adopted the following recommendation from the Executive : &quot; That this Conference, whilst reiterating its firm conviction as to the justice of the claim for the exemption of all incomes up to  250 per annum from payment of income tax, urges all districts to await the decision of the Commission now sitting to inquire into the incidence of the tax before taking any further action.&quot; With regard to the question of wage increases for certain kinds of work, the Conference con-sidered a demand referred to it by the Lancashire and Cheshire Miners&apos; Federation after unsuccessful negotiation with the employers in that area, for payment for a shift and one-fifth on each shift worked on the afternoon and night turns. It should be noted that this system has been in force in South Wales since the strike of July, 1915. As a result of the discussion at the Conference, it was decided to attempt to secure that the practice should be made national. With regard to the question of overtime and surface work, which has for some time been under discussion between the National Council of Mine Workers other than Miners and the Government, the M.F.G.B. decided to take the matter up as a national question, and instructed the executive to formulate a complete programme for submission to a later conference for approval. The fact that the M.F.G.B. has decided to champion the claims of the National Council of Mine Workers other than Miners, with which its relations have not always been amicable, is an interesting tactical move in its general strategical plan for obtaining control of the industry by first absorbing all workers in and around the mines into its own organisation, or at least securing the adhesion of the unions to which they belong.Stabilisation and Consolidation of Wages. With regard to the general question of the stabilisation of wages, and in particular the method to be adopted for dealing with war advances and bonuses after the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act expires on 20th November, the Minister had a Conference on the 15th inst. with representative employers and on the 20th inst. with representatives of the Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades&apos; Federation, the A.S.E., the National Federation of General Workers, the National Federa-tion of Women Workers, and the Trade Union side of the Provisional Joint Committee of the National Industrial Conference. A further conference will take place between the Minister and the employers. The trade union representatives on the 20th inst. were unanimous in urging the extension of the Act as it stands for twelve months to
30th September, 1920. This attitude, as was indicated in last week&apos;s issue of this Report, was expected. With regard to the more difficult question of the consolidation of war wages into permanent rates, it is probable that if some further period of temporary stabilisation is sanctioned by the Cabinet, the trade unions and employers will use the extension of time for direct negotiation on the question of consolidation.Economic Causes of Unrest.-With the approach of winter the economic causes of unrest, such as the general cost of living and the shortage of houses, are having an increasing effect on the industrial situation. This, as has previously been suggested in this Eeport, was only to be expected. The announcement in the current issue of the &quot; Labour Gazette &quot; that the general level of retail prices of food and other items of household expenditure on 1st October was 120 per cent, above the pre-war level, as compared with 115 per cent, a month earlier and 105 per cent, in June is of interest in this connection^ and has an intimate relation to the question of wages in important groups of industries. It will be remembered that in June several groups of unions in the engineering and other trades made a claim to the Court of Arbitration for an increase of 155. per week in wages, and the employers countered this by an application for a decrease of 56&apos;. per week. The Court of Arbitration decided that neither claim was established, and in its judgment explicitly raised the question of the cost of living. Applications for similar increases have again been made to the Court of Arbitration, and Labour expects that the increase in the cost of living since the last hearing will have an influence on the award. In the meantime the Ironfounders have definitely rejected&apos; the provisional settlement negotiated by their executive stabilising the present rates of wages until 30th September, 1920. They have apparently been somewhat influenced in this decision by the increasing cost of living.Reports from various centres indicate that the shortage of houses is creating acute discontent and unrest, especially among ex-Service men, who are specially severely hit by the general lack of houses. The apparent ineffectiveness of the measures of the Government and Local Authorities to meet the situation arouse passionate criticism. In many cases lack of housing accommodation directly affects the development of industry, by rendering practically impossible any considerable movement of labour.   .Building Trade Wages. A situation which has already given rise to considerable difficulty and seems likely to produce still more is the tendency in the building trade for masters and men to come to an agreement upon rates of wages considerably in excess of those authorised by the Ministry of Labour. Private individuals and com-panies, in their anxiety to get building done at any cost, submit to these rates, and if they choose to have their buildings erected at extortionate cost, the Ministry is powerless to prevent it. But a serious aspect of the case is that the willingness of private individuals to pay excessive rates gains for them a vicious priority over public housing schemes ; and in some districts where no progress is being made with such schemes, and cinemas or factories are being erected, the seeds of much industrial unrest are being sown. &quot; One solution of the problem would be to re-introduce, in a somewhat more elastic way, the system of priority licences that was in force during the war.Trade Union Topics.Amalgamated Society of Engineers. In the current issue of the monthly journal and report of this Society, it is intimated that a circular has been sent to branches requesting them to take a vote on the question of making a levy of 2d. per member to assist the Union of Police and Prison Officers. * A letter of appeal for financial assistance from the union is attached. The result of the ballot on the question of co-operating with the Government in. connection with the scheme for training disabled sailors and soldiers is announced. The voting was : for 12,698, against 30,064, giving a majority of 17,366 against. A dispute seems likely to occur at the works of Messrs. Moutons, Wishaw, in connection with the decision of the firm to introduce a system of payment by results. The local district committee has decided to withdraw its members if the firm persists in its intention.Union of Post Office Workers.-The &quot; Postal and Telegraph Record,&quot; referring to the decision of the Amalgamation Conference of the postal unions to adopt a strike policy as a first plank in the platform of the new union, points out that the decision is not popular in some quarters within the union, but maintains that the political work of the U.P.W. must be complementary to, and not a substitute for, a vigorous industrial policy. &quot; While the wage system and the present industrial order exist, postal workers are in the labour market, and must sell their labour for the best price they can exact from the employer.* This levy was made, and as a result the Police Union received a cheque for  1,914. (C 1905) 3 0 2
On the other hand, the employer will strive to purchase the labour as cheaply as possible. The adoption of a strike policy is only a declaration that the members of the union recognise the fact that they are employed not because they need employment, but because the employer needs labour. The worker retains his hold on the strike because it is the only effective weapon he has. If the Union of Post Office Workers were so foolish as to announce to the world that under no circumstances would it resort to a strike, it would simply rob itself of all effectiveness as a trade union.&quot; In respect of the right to strike, this union recognises no distinction between Government servants and ordinary workers.British Seafarers&apos;&apos; Union. In the &quot; British Seafarer,&quot; the organ of this union, the interesting announcement is made that the balance remaining over from the strike fund raised in connection with the strike on the Isle of Wight tug and. passage boats has been handed over to the Southampton Trades and Labour Council to form the nucleus of a strike fund.Scottish Farm Servants&apos; Union. In the &quot; Scottish Farm Servant,&quot; the monthly organ of this union, considerable attention is paid to the movement for increased production. The general attitude of the journal is that the Government^ efforts are merely directed towards getting more work out of the workers, while doing practically nothing to put an end to the riotous waste on the part of consumers.Workers&apos; Union. An interesting and somewhat significant extension of the activities of this union is reported. A deputation of Gibraltar dockyard workers recently visited this country and got into touch with the Workers&apos; Union, whose executive appointed Mr. Matt Giles to go to Gibraltar and organise the dockyard workers, who are reported to number 8,000, as a branch of the union, It is now stated that this branch of the union has been formed and has made a demand for the same percentage increase on pre-war rates as had been granted in England, and for compensation on the rate of exchange. This is the first extra-United Kingdom activity of this union.Ex-Service Men.Ex-Soldiers and the Employment of Women. Ex-Service men continue to register protests against the employment of women in posts for which ex-soldiers are suitable, and they are receiving some support in their attitude from public bodies. The Farn-borough Town Council on the 15th inst. passed a resolution protesting against the continued employment of women by the Navy and Army Canteen Board and in Government offices. It is reported that the Rotherham Local Employment Committee discussed on the 14th inst. allegations with regard to postal authorities dismissing men and retaining women, and resolved to send a resolution to the Post master-General strongly protesting against the practice. The Executive of the ex-Service Men&apos;s Clerical Association re-affirmed its protest on the 15th inst, against the discharge of ex-Service men from clerical employ in Government departments while men who have not served during the war and women are still being retained.Ex-Service Man and Municipal Elections. The Bristol Grand Federal Council of ex-Service men&apos;s organisations have issued a manifesto with regard to the municipal elections, stating that it is essential that they should have representation upon the City Council, and with that end in view they have determined to run certain candidates for whom they claim support. Their policy appears to be : (1) the roads must be repaired in such a way as to absorb many of the unemployed ex-Service men ; (2) the employment of female labour on the tramways must be stopped ; and (3) a proper housing scheme must be put into operation.International Labour Conference, Washington.The Bate of the Conference. Secretary Wilson has announced that he will open the Conference on 29th October. He appears, however, to consider that the holding of the Conference at that date is doubtful. He announces that the Conference will be held if the Treaty is then effective, and it appears possible from his announcement that the Conference will be held even if the United States does not ratify by that date. If, however, the Treaty has not become effective by 29th October, the Government of the United States will adjourn the Conference to a later date. With reference to this statement, later information makes it certain that the Conference itself will not be postponed, though the Conference may decide to adjourn formal proceedings (since many neutrals will not have adhered to the League even if the Treaty is in operation) and to continue informal meetings which could be confirmed at a later stage when neutrals would have ratified.
International Labour Office.-It will be remembered that for the organising of the International Labour Office it is necessary for eight States of chief industrial importance to be selected. This cannot now be done before the Council of the League of Nations meets, and the Council cannot meet until fifteen days after the Treaty has become effective. It thus appears to be very uncertain whether the International Labour Office can be set up before the Washington Conference dissolves. In the terms of the Treaty the Inter-national Labour Office, when it is formed, is to communicate, not through the Foreign Offices, but directly to the Ministries of Labour in the several States. The Ministry of Labour will therefore be approached directly for information and may be asked to take action in regard to any conventions agreed on at Washington.Policy of the British Government. In view of the fact that the Minister of Labour has laid on the table of the House of Commons a draft Bill dealing with the regulation of hours, which differs in important respects from the draft convention on the eight-hour day pre-pared by the Organising Committee of the Conference, the War Cabinet has decided that the British delegates should support the principles contained in the Minister of Labour&apos;s draft Bill.Delegates. Delegates of most of the States are now on their way to Washington. It is to be regretted that Mr. Arthur Henderson has decided not to attend the Conference. Owing to the difficulty of securing the necessary shipping accommodation the delegates of the Australian Commonwealth cannot leave Australia before 30th October, and therefore cannot arrive in Washington until about 21st November, A difficulty may arise at Washington in regard to the representative of Indian Labour. The Viceroy has appointed a certain Mr. Joshi, who has already sailed from India. The Viceroy&apos;s appointment appears to have been made in ignorance of the terms of the Treaty, which expressly lays down that labour organisations shall be consulted. The Trade Unions of Madras had . already appointed Mr. B. P. Wadia as their delegate, and it is understood that the India Office has now asked Mr. Wadia to act as adviser to Mr. Joshi who is, in fact, a social worker in no way connected with Indian Labour. It is probable that a protest will be made at Washington on the examination of the credentials of Mr. Joshi. If this occurs, the Labour delegations may press for the acceptance of Mr. Wadia in the place of the Viceroy&apos;s minee.Part V. Departmental and District Reports. I. Departmental Reports.Appointments Department.Hardship Cases. During the period from the 27th September to the 13th October inclusive 139 hardship cases have been dealt with.Training Grants Scheme. The Grants Committee have received from the District Selective Committees 9,681 applications for training,&apos; of which 6,404 have so far been sanctioned.Disability Training. The total number of cases dealt with to date is 341, of which 186 are in training and 89 have completed training.District Selective Committees and Interviewing Boards. During the week 56 meetings of Interviewing Boards have been held and 527 candidates have been interviewed. -Several of the Boards have devoted particular attention to trade disputes in the engineering industry.Training Department.Interrupted Apprenticeship Schemes. A scheme has been approved for the sheet and plate glass industry. The number of approved schemes is now 34. Agreements had been received up to the 15th October in respect of 15,053 apprentices and 5,164 employees. Grants had been sanctioned in respect of 14,584 apprentices.Employment Department.Work of the Court of Referees. Up to the 9th October, 331,429 claims to out-of-work -donation had been referred to appeals officers in Great Britain. Of this number 303,090 cases had been heard by the Court of Referees. An analysis of 287,215 claims heard shows that 73,317 were allowed, 213,383 disallowed and in 515 cases a compromise was arranged. The proportion of disallowances to claims heard is therefore 74 - 3 per cent. Of the total disallowances 47 - 8 per cent, were disallowed owing to refusal to accept suitable employ-ment.
Prosecution for Fraud. Up to the 17th October, 1,372 cases had been referred to the solicitor with a view to prosecution for attempted, fraud in connection with out-of-work donation. In 554 cases the defendant was fined, 144 imprisoned, 54 bound over and 5 admonished.   In 126 cases the summonses were dismissed.Unemployment. On the 10th October, 453,347 men and 97,057 women were on the live register.. Vacancies remained available for 34,178 men and 43,600 women. The number of juveniles on the live register was 31,893, and the number of juvenile vacancies available was 14,112.Wages and Arbitration Department.Court of Arbitration. During the week ended the 18th October, 1919, the Court of Arbitration heard 31 cases, 20 in London and 11 in Glasgow. The principal cases heard were as follows: Building Trade-The court held an inquiry to consider the advice they should give to the Minister of Labour on the question whether he should approve an agreement dated the 13th May, 1919, of the Midland Area Joint Council for the building trades in so far as it deals with towns where both employers and operatives are parties thereto. Foundry Trades (Scotland). An application by the Associated Iron, Steel and Brass Dressers of Scotland to the Scottish Steel Founders Wages Association, the National Light Castings Ironfounders&apos; Association, the Ayrshire Founders&apos; Association, the Bathgate Employers&apos; Association, the Dundee Association of Engineers and Ironfounders, the Kirkcaldy and District Engineers Masters&apos; Association, the West of Scotland Iron and Steel Founders&apos; Association and the Aberdeen and District Engineering Employers&apos;&apos; Association for an advance of 15s. a week from 1st August, 1919.Building Trade Operatives : Government Work. The Court have decided that the rates set out in the Committee on Production awards for building trade operatives on Government work in London and the South Eastern counties, the Mid Southern counties and at the Blandford Camp, shall be paid in respect of work at present in progress and covered by those awards. In respect of work hereafter to be undertaken the rates payable shall be the prescribed or substituted rates within the meaning of the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act, 1918 (Award No. 807). .        &apos;Ex-Service Men : Ministry of Munitions, Admiralty and War Office. Circulars have been issued by the departments arranging for the payment from the 1st April, 1919, of&quot; unskilled and semi-skilled ex-Service men who have served abroad and are between 18 and 21 years of age at the adult rate excluding the 121 Per cen^- bonus.  Apprentices and improvers in skilled trades are not included.Woolcombers. The result of the ballot with regard to systematic overtime in the wool textile trade by the operative woolcombers, showed a majority of 3,893 in favour of working overtime. The union secretaries state that the only matter for adjustment is the working hours for overtime.Joint Industrial Councils Division.Civil Service. The second meeting of the National Council was held at Montagu House on the 14th October. The chief interest of the proceedings lay in the passing of the following resolution : (1) That,a special committee be appointed to consider the scope and duties at present allotted to the clerical classes in the Civil Service ; to report on the organisation most appropriate to secure the effective performance of these duties and to make recommendations as to scales of salary and method of recruitment; that a sub-committee of the above committee be appointed for the purpose of considering and reporting upon the position of the temporary staffs ; (2) that a special committee be appointed to consider increase in the cost of living and its effect upon the salaries of Civil Servants ; whether permanent or temporary, and to report to the Council; (3) that a grade committee be appointed to consider the remuneration of the women clerks, but that this committee shall not decide upon the application of the principle of equal pay for equal duties.Trade Boards Division.The Hollow-Ware Trade Board (Great Britain) have varied the general minimum time-rates at present in operation for male and female workers in accordance with their notice of proposal dated 12th July, 1919, and have requested the Minister to make an Order confirming these variations and specifying 27th October, 1919, as the date from which the new rates shall become effective.
The Paper Box Trade Board (Great Britain) have varied the general minimum time-rates at present in operation for male and female workers, and have fixed piece-work basis time-rates for male and female workers. The Board has asked the Minister to make an Order confirming these rates and specifying 17th November, 1919, as the date from which they shall become effective.The Tailoring Trade Board (Great Britain) have varied the general minimum time-rates at present in operation for male and female workers, and have fixed piece-work basis time-rates for male and female workers. The Board has asked the Minister to make an Order confirming these rates and specifying 17th November, 1919, as the date from which these rates shall become effective.(2) District Reports. :London and South-Eastern.Unemployment. No figures with regard to unemployment are available for the week ending 3rd October. The speeding up of demobilisation, the end of harvest work, hop-picking, fruit gathering and similar occupations, and the closing of the holiday season, are expected to increase the numbers of unemployed during the Avinter months.Out-of-Work Donation. Rochester Employment Committee expressed its disapproval of the umpired ruling refusing donation to the moulders&apos; labourers now unemployed through the moulders&apos; strike.Effects of Ironfounders&apos; Strike. The ironfounders&apos; strike has caused considerable dislocation in the engineering trade, owing to the stoppage in the supply of castings.Shortage of Labour. Several Local Employment Committees, e.g., Kingston, report that industry is seriously retarded by the retention of skilled pattern-makers and building tradesmen with the colours. It is stated that men now working in these trades have refused to work overtime until their fellow skilled men are released.Shortage of Transport. It is reported that the Great Eastern Railway have from 5,000 to 6,000 wagons awaiting repairs (approximately the same number as last July), and are quite unable to overtake the arrears of repair work. Orders for 2,000 new railway trucks are stated to have been lodged with the Royal Arsenal Authorities, Woolwich. Serious complaints come to hand of the difficulties experienced in obtaining delivery of material, especially for road work.Shortage of Coal. Laundries, textile, food and confectionery factories, and small works generally, are held up by the restricted supply of coal.. South Midlands and Eastern.Unemployment. The usual statistics showing the unemployment position are not available this week. It is reported that the situation at Luton is now normal, as the electric power-station is supplying full power.Out-of-Work Donation. King&apos;s Lynn Employment Committee expressed the opinion that no man in receipt of 100 per cent, disability pension should be entitled to receive Out-of-Work Donation, even if he were employable.Employment of Ex-Service Men. At Kettering, particulars of the National Scheme have been circulated to 255 employers and 23 undertakings have so far been received. A poor response has been reported from Grays.South-Western,Unemployment. The live register for the week ending 10th October shows a total increase of 5,029, of whom 4,949 are men and 80 are women. Bristol shows an increase of 109 in men, apparent mainly in conveyance and engineering ; Plymouth a general increase of 679 in men; Portsmouth an increase in men of 209, shipbuilding and engineering accounting for the main part; Southampton a general increase in men of 1,503, convey-ance accounting for 979 and shipbuilding 160.Shortage of Transport. General complaints are made of&quot; the inadequacy of rail-transport. One prominent firm in Cheltenham states that its working hours a week are entirely controlled by the extent to which the railway company will accept goods for despatch. Work at Christow quarries is hampered by lack of facilities for the conveyance of workers from Exeter. In a scattered area such as this division, the greatest factor in industry is transport, and if the Government scheme for motor-lorry road transport materialises into a permanent institution, local manufacturers will derive full benefit ; therefrom.
Shortage of Coal. It is anticipated that the Portsmouth Tramways Companies will reduce their service 50 per cent, in consequence of a shortage of coal.Government Discharges. Further discharges are anticipated from the R.N. Cordite Factory, Holton Heath. A deputation from the Plymouth Port Development Committee and the Town Council recently interviewed the First Lord of the Admiralty with reference to the future of Devonport Dockyard. The gradual discharge of from 4,000 to 5,000 men is expected.Employment of Ex-Service Men. -It is reported that at Bristol 1,981 letters were despatched to local employers with reference to the National Scheme, and 45 straight-forward undertakings have been accepted. Cowes Employment Committee has declined to adopt the scheme on the ground that the chief local industries, shipbuilding and engineer-ing, offer small hope of absorbing disabled men. At Trowbridge, 20 undertakings have been received up to the present. A poor response to the appeal has been elicited at Torquay.General. At Bristol, the promotion of the plan for the Avonmouth Low Level Road is being pressed forward. Owing to the great increase of work at the Docks the Port Labour Committee have issued 250 temporary tallies, available for one week, allowing additional men to work on the docks.West Midlands.Unemployment. The usual statistics of unemployment are not available for this week&apos;s report, but the following approximate figures have been obtained showing the number of emergency claims made up to 3rd October in six representative areas :  Birmingham, 3,850; Cannock, 1,200; Coventry, 500; Hanley, 1,740; Smethwick, 700 ; and Wolverhampton, 850. This number is considered small, in comparison with the magnitude of the railway strike. The unemployment position at Bilston has materially improved, inasmuch as Messrs. G. Hickman, Ltd., are now working their Bessemer steel department two shifts out of three. There are no big contracts in sight in the saddlery and harness trade at Birmingham and Walsall, and the outlook is black.Oul-of-Work Donation. The Short Time Tribunal of this Division have decided that out-of-work donation is payable in cases affected by the moulders&apos; strike.Effects of Ironfounders&apos; Strike. The ironfounders&apos; strike is having a most adverse influence on the resettlement of industry. Coventry and Rugby employers are most heavily hit, but the effects are being felt in Birmingham and the Black Country to an appreciable extent. Development schemes are arrested, and even such trades as the manufacture of cycle lamp lenses, in which cast bevelling tools are used for rough grinding, are affected. The voting in the West Midlands went very heavily against the proposed settlement of the dispute, but outside of the Ironfounders&apos; Society there are no indications of enthusiasm in the Trade Union movement.Shortage of Labour. In the Burton-on-Trent, Leek and Stoke-on-Trent areas, a shortage of skilled building labour is reported. Colliery platelayers are also required at Burton-on-Trent.Shortage of Transport. Mr. J. Barker, timber merchant, Shrewsbury; the Sentinel Wagon Co., Shrewsbury; Messrs. Armourduct, Ltd., Witton; the Simplex Conduits, Birmingham; and Redditch Employment Committee report the serious effect on industry of inadequate transport facilities. The co-ordination of the various methods of transport is a question w*hich occupies local attention, and it is generally felt that canal traffic should be considerably developed for the relief of the prevailing congestion of the railways.Shortage of Material. Newcastle-under-Lyme Local Authority reports that shortage of building material is handicapping its housing scheme, Redditch Employment Committee complains of a shortage of steel wire for the staple industry (needles), and Shrewsbury Employment Committee states that work at the Sentinel Wagon Co. is suffering from lack of raw material.Employment of Ex-Service Men. Only 45 firms in the Stoke-on-Trent area have completed agreements under the National Scheme (39 of these already having their full quota). The Employment Committee are making a further appeal. Practically all the large employers in Smethwick have agreed to adopt the scheme, but owing to the iron-founders&apos; strike are at present unable to accept additional labour. At Shrewsbury, so far only 13 replies have been-received to the 271 letters originally issued to local employers. Redditch Committee regard the six undertakings which have been returned to date for their consideration, as an unsatisfactory response. It is thought that the delay in inaugurat-ing a training scheme for the needle, fish hook and fishing tackle industry is partially responsible.
Yorkshire and East Midlands.Unemployment. The weekly statistics of unemployment are not to hand for the week ending the 4th October. There was a total decrease in the live register for the week ending the 26th September of.470, representing a decrease of 576 men and an increase of .106 women. Information received to date indicates a general resumption of work after the railway strike, but a large number of firms are continuing in short-time arrangements.There is no doubt that a considerable amount of - unemployment is being caused through inequality of distribution both of raw7 materials and of goods. An outside officer is conducting an investigation into the supplies of yarn available at the present time, in view of important applications for payment of out-of-work donation to short-time workers, which are presently to come before the Tribunal.Out-of-Work Donation. Gainsborough Employment Committee passed a unanimous resolution, that the workers suspended at Messrs. Marshall^ foundry, owing to the iron-founders&apos; strike, should be eligible for emergency donation. In view of the large number of Employment Committees which have raised this question, the next meeting of the Divisional Council will consider the Department^ ruling, from which it is noted that legislation is required to change the regulation covering this question.Effects of&apos; Ironfounders&apos; Strike. The effect upon the engineering trade is now distinctly serious. At Bradford 350 A.S.E. men are affected and 400 labourers. At Keighley 920 are unemployed, including engineers, tool-makers and fitters&apos; labourers. At Shipley, 170 members of the A.S.E. Tool-makers&apos; and Labourers&apos; Unions are affected. At Otley, all the firms are going on short-time this week. In Leeds, Halifax and Huddersfield, the position is no worse than was reported last week, but the dislocation of work and consequent suspension of men,must of necessity soon become very acute.Impediments to Production. The following are reported as impediments to production at the present time, (1) shortage of materials due to railway strike, (2) shortage of houses, (3) shortage of bricklayers, (4) shortage of coal, and (5) retention of skilled men with the colours.Overtime in the Woolcombing Industry.-It is understood that the A.S.E. are making it a condition of working overtime in the woolcombing industry that the Federation will absorb a proportion of 1 in 4 of the A.S.E. members now unemployed through the iron-founders&apos; strike, and retain them until the shortage in tops is overcome.*Northern.Unemployment. It is impossible to give any precise information on&apos;the position of unemployment during the period for the week ending the 4th October, owing to the conditions brought into play by the railway strike. An approximate summary of the totals on the live register for this period shows an increase of 3,909 on the total prior to the strike.Effects of Ironfounders&quot; Strike-Eight firms report that the strike is gravely affecting their works.Employment of Ex-Service Men. It is reported that the North of England School Furnishing Co. have absorbed 84 ex-Service men since January, and that even the disabled are in receipt of full rates of pay.Replacement of Female by Male Labour.-Tl\e Rise Carr Rolling Mills, Darlington are dispensing with women labour as soon as possible, and suitable male applicants are being submitted for substitution by the Exchange. The women at work with the North of England School Furnishing Co. will be discharged on the termination of their special contract.Federation of Master Builders. In explanation of the fact that only one tender has been received for the Newcastle housing scheme, the Chairman of the Newcastle Building Committee reports the refusal of the Master Builders&apos; Federation to compete, unless contractors who are not members of the Federation are excluded from the competition.New Industrial Developments. Messrs. Armstrong, Whitworth &amp; Co., Ltd., Newcastle, report that their new locomotive works now employ 1,300 men and hope to increase the number shortly to 3,000. The Blake Boiler, Wagon and Engineering Co., Ltd., state that they intend, as soon as an agreement can be arranged, to start a night shift and employ an additional 300 men.(C 1905) 3 D
Wales.Unemployment. The live register for the week ending the 26th September shows a total decrease of 409, consisting of 246 men and 163 women. Unemployment is most rife at Newport, Merthyr, Barry and Cardiff, the principal occupational groups affected being general labourers, dock labourers, iron and steel workers, and shipyard and boiler shop labourers among men, and agricultural workers and domestics among women. The position at Merthyr, Dowlais and Ebbw Vale is still very serious. The tin-plate works at Llanelly continue on short-time as a result of the water famine.Shortage of Transport and Labour. Lack of wagons at Messrs. Spillers and Bakers&apos; Cardiff mills, and Messrs. Rank&apos;s Barry mills, threatens to cause a grave shortage of food-stuffs in South &quot;Wales. This same factor is retarding progress in the manufacture of bricks at Wrexham.   The shortage of skilled labour is acute in the building trade.Training. The training of disabled ex-Service men in agriculture is under the consideration of the Bargoed Employment Committee. The first dressmaking centre in Wales has been opened at Mountain Ash.Tin-Plate Industry. The present situation in the tin-plate trade, which appears to be more settled than at any period since the armistice, is considered attributable in large measure to the working of the Joint Industrial Council. About 70 per cent, of the tin-plate mills are now operating, trade is brisk, and high prices are being obtained.for tin-plates. There is an acute shortage of mill hands, doublers, and furnacemen, and employers do not meet with much success in their efforts to obtain men.Swansea Docks. It is reported that labour troubles have had the largest share in producing the present serious financial position at Swansea Docks. Proposals are on foot for closing down a portion of the docks properties. Swansea is an important metallurgical centre-tin-plates, steel, iron, spelter, copper, &amp;c. and any restriction of dock facilities would be very detrimental to local industries.- Labour Situation in the South Wales Coalfield. The coalfield continues to enjoy an unusual immunity from strikes, and the many local disputes which arise are being promptly and satisfactorily dealt with by the Disputes Committees of the Conciliation Board. The nationalisation campaign has begun : it will probably be in full force within the next month. The coal-owners in South Wales have strongly protested recently against the present licence policy for coal export and directly attributed the idleness of certain pits to the compulsion of this cause.Scotland.Unemployment. No figures representing the unemployment position have been received this week from Scotland. At Alloa, the industrial situation is considered to be more satisfactory than in any other part of the country. At Dumbarton the closing-down of H.M. Alexandria Factory, which threatens unemployment for 1,200 workers, is anticipated. At Renfrew, skilled workmen in the engineering and shipbuilding industries, including riveters, platers, machine-men, tinners and caulkers are unemployed in large numbers.&quot; The demand for women workers at the woollen mills in Galashiels still exceeds the supply. As a result of the inevitable congestion caused by inadequate transport facilities and the accumulation of stocks, the register at Leith has doubled its numbers, but the position is improving daily.Effects of Bricklayers&apos;&apos; Strike.-The Lanarkshire Steel Trade is gravely affected by the strike of bricklayers. Although the strike has been in progress for only a fortnight, the shipyards and other establishments dependent on the supply of steel are already suspending workers, owing to insufficiency of supplies.Shortage of Labour. A shortage of building trades men, e.g., bricklayers, joiners and. pattern makers, is reported at Renfrew and Paisley. The scarcity of apprentices is considered a serious matter in the trade.Shortage of Transport. It is inevitable that there should be complaints of non-delivery of supplies, until the transport service has overtaken the arrears of work caused by the strike. Several firms report that they have employees whose retention depends upon the delivery of goods within the next week. The failure of. transport to bring steel supplies, has held up work at the Mose Street Foundry and Shipbuilding Co., Inverness, and non-delivery of boiler plates is impeding progress with shipbuilding, engineering and boilermaking firms at Aberdeen.Shortage of Material-It is reported that at least three large firms have laid down new rolling-mills and a much increased output is expected, but the shortage of steel-plates is acute. It is stated that orders are now being placed in America, deliveries being given in six weeks.
v   . . Part VI. Disputes.(a) Involving a Stoppage of Work.Building and Allied Trades.Building Operatives-North-West Area. A serious position has been created in this district the employers having informed, the operatives&apos; representatives that, unless they get the men on strike at Frodsham, Widnes and St. Helens back to work, they will consider locking out the whole of the trade. The men have called a meeting for next Sunday to decide on the question of striking.&quot;Building Operatives Lincoln,-^-The strike of building operatives at Lincoln has been settled by the application of the Arbitration Award granting Is. 8d. an hour.Bricklayers Scotland. In connection with the strike of bricklayers in Scottish steel -works, a joint conference was held at Glasgow on Saturday. The employers offered to discuss the question of wages on the condition that the men resumed work first. The men&apos;s repre-sentatives undertook to place this proposal before the strikers. The strike is seriously affecting the output of steel in Scotland.Painters Dumfries. A strike of painters took place about a fortnight ago over a demand for an increase of 3d. an hour. This was rejected by the masters on the ground that there is a working agreement between the parties which does not terminate until the 1st January.Mining and Quarrying.Coal Miners-South Wales,-The points in dispute at the Maerdy Pit, Gwaun-cae-Gurwen (See Report for week ending the 15th October, p. 338). have been considered by the Coal Controllers Department. A ballot of the men taken on the proposals submitted showed 464 in favour of and 124 against their acceptance. ,The dispute, which arose at the Lower Deep Colliery, Blaina, respecting the standard rate of pay of one of the electricians, has now been settled and the whole of the men, numbering about 1,200, have resumed work. The men struck owing to the fact that the owners (Messrs. Lancaster &amp; Co.) paid one electrician less than another though both were performing the same work.Metal, Engineering and Shipbuilding.Ironfounders. The provisional agreement arrived at by the joint conference of Trade Union Executives and Employers held in London on the 11th inst., has been decisively rejected by the rank and file of the strikers.  The ballot taken on the terms resulted as follows :-Against acceptance .........        27,938Por acceptance      .. ....     ..      ...    1,678(C 1905)Majority against........   26,2603 D 2Employment of Ex-Service Men.-It is generally felt that employers have not yet responded in any full measure to the appeal made under the National Scheme. Ten per cent, of the employers circularised have so far completed the undertaking at Galashiels. In the Paisley, Barrhead, Johnstone and Renfrew areas, 14 firms have completed forms of undertaking. The opinion is expressed in Lanarkshire that most of the industries carried on in the Motherwell area are too heavy for the absorption of 5 per cent, disabled men.Intervention in Disputes. The precedent created by the 14 representative trades unionists who intervened in the railway dispute, has been followed by Mr. J. Walker, the Scottish representative of the British Steel Smelters&apos; Association, who succeeded in bringing both sides in the bricklayers&apos; dispute to a conference on the 17th inst.Scottish Industrial Woollen Workers&apos; Union. The officials of the Workers&apos; Union are reported to be endeavouring to enlist the sympathy and co-operation of the other trades unions against this new union.   (See last week&apos;s Report, page 337.)Seafarers&apos; Union. It is reported that Councillor Shinwell, organiser of the British Seafarers&apos; Union, with the unofficial backing of Mr. H. Hopkins, Clyde District Secretary, A.S.E., Mr. S. Nimlin. Clyde District Secretary, Federation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Trades, and Mr. J. Shaw, chairman of the Glasgow Trades Council, is making strong efforts to gain the support of the members of Mr. Havelock Wilson&apos;s Union (National Seamen and Piremen&apos;s Union).General. Recent experience seems to have encouraged a growing disbelief among trade unionists in the efficacy of a large-scale strike. The general body of industrial workers throughout Scotland continue in an unsettled condition. The paramount question is the high cost of living. Strong effort is being made through various channels to popularise the demand for the nationalisation of industries.
The percentage of members voting is high, compared with the original ballot which registered&apos;17,284 in favour of a strike and 2,161 against a strike, and when due consideration is given to the fact that apprentices and those who have not been full members for a year, or are out of benefit through non-payment of contributions, are not permitted to vote. The Irish moulders on strike have also declined the proposals. Men in the Monmouthshire Eastern Valleys have accepted the offer of a weekly wage of  4 10s. and resumed work.Steel Workers South Wales. Further negotiations with a view to bringing about a settle-ment of the strike at Dowlais, Ebbw Vale and Tredegar Steelworks were undertaken at the week-end, when a joint conference was held at Newport. At Panteg a compromise has been arranged, the men agreeing to &quot; carry on &quot; upon the basis of  4 12s. Qd. a week, an increase of 9s. 3d. on the former offer of the employers;  The general outlook is reported to be improving.Fellows Magneto Company Park Royal.- These works have been closed as the result of a proposal by the management to reduce wages. The men, who had begun to work on the reduced rates, took their case to the Union. The latter refused to negotiate until the rates were raised to the former level. The firm declined to do this, and a partial strike took place, resulting in the closing of the works.Shopmen and Fitters Swansea Docks. A settlement of this strike, which began on the 8th inst., was reached at the end of last week, the men resuming work pending the award covering dry docks in the Bristol Channel ports.Textile Trades.Merino Spinners Messrs. Hollins &amp; Co., Notts.-&apos;Xhe strike of employees of the above firm is stated to be collapsing by degrees. Mr. W. Thome, M.P., General Secretary to the National Union of General Workers, speaking at a mass meeting of the employees, condemned the attitude of the firm towards the proposal that the Ministry of Labour should be asked to intervene, and stated his intention of calling attention to the matter in the House of Commons, when it assembles this week.Clothing Trades.Farriers London Area. A strike of furriers at Messrs. Smith&apos;s establishment took place last week and threatened to involve the whole of the London area. The strike was settled by the reinstatement of a man who had been dismissed from the firm.Wood-working.Furniture Trade Lock-Out. The lock-out in the furniture trade, which lasted in some districts for 17 weeks, partially terminated on the 21st instant. The terms of settlement which were provisionally drawn up by a Sub-Committee of the Joint Industrial Council, and accepted by that body, include an immediate increase of 2d. per hour on the standard rates in all districts to male operatives, and Id. per hour to female operatives. These terms have not been accepted in all the districts concerned, and the men at High Wycombe remain locked out.Miscellaneous.Brush-workers Kent. Employees of the Kent Brush Manufacturing Company who have been on strike for a month have returned to work. They have obtained the recognition of their Union, and considerable increases in their wages.Hairdressers Glasgow. This dispute has now been referred to the Ministry of Labour, which has invited both sides to attend a conference when the situation will be fully discussed.Waitresses Post Office Savings Bank. A strike of about 100 women workers at the canteen attached to the Post Office Savings Bank, West Kensington, took place on the 18th inst. over the dismissal of two employees who had acted as shop stewards. The strikers are members of the National Federation of Women Workers.  Negotiations are taking place.Professional.Teachers North Riding. The strike of Elementary School Teachers which has been in progress since the beginning of June has been settled, the matters in dispute being referred to arbitration.(b) Not Involving a Stoppage of WorkBuilding and Allied Trades.Building Trade Operatives General. A serious situation has arisen in the Building Trade over a demand put forward by the operatives for a general advance of id. an hour. The matter is under discussion by the National Conciliation Board now sitting in London. About 250,000 operatives are affected, and a general strike is threatened unless a settlement is speedily reached.
AH inquiries relating to this report should be addressed to : Intelligence Division,Ministry of Labour,Montagu House,Whitehall,London, S.W. 1.Building Operatives Penzance. Negotiations are proceeding in connection with a demand of the men for Is. Gd. per hour for skilled workers, and Is. 5d. for labourers. They have rejected an offer of the employers to grant Is. \\d. and Is. per hour respectively.Plumbers1 Apprentices Edinburgh. A stoppage of plumbers in Edinburgh, is threatened in consequence of a situation arising with regard to demobilised apprentices in the trade. The employers in the district have accepted the Government Scheme for assisting these youths, but do not consent to make payment retrospective. The apprentices have therefore decided to cease work on Saturday, and the operative plumbers have agreed to join them. As only 176 plumbers voted for this decision, it was decided that a ballot vote should be taken during the week of the whole of the operatives involved.Textile Trades.Bleachers, Dyers and Finishers. In consequence of delay in negotiations which have been proceeding since June for an increased basic wage rate, the Operative Bleachers, Dyers and Finishers&apos; Association has instructed its members, about 70,000 in number, to hand in notices to cease work on the 1st November. The immediate cause of the trouble is said to be an intimation by the employers that, owing to the prevailing conditions in the district where a local dispute is in progress, they would not enter at present into the general wages question.Lace Curtain Operatives. In connection with this dispute (See Report for week ending the 15th October, p. 339), a Joint Conference was held at Glasgow on the 21st instant.Transport.Dockers. The Executive of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation has now issued to all employers of dock and waterside labour in Great Britain, an application for a general revision of wages. The employers are invited to attend a National Conference to discuss these proposals, and it is suggested that the National Negotiating Committee which drafted the 44-hour agreement should act as conveners of this conference.Coal Tippers and Trimmers. A National Conference of coal tippers and trimmers convened by the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation was held on the 17th instant in London. A national application for increases of wages for tippers was formulated, and the question of a revision of tariffs for trimmers towards a national standard was referred to a sub-committee of the Federation.Wood-working.Packing Case Workers. Demands have been put forward by workers in the wood packing case industry for an increase of 4fc . on present rates, making the rate 2s. an hour, and for the abolition, as from the 31st December, of all piece-work and bonus schemes.Miscellaneous.Co-operative Employees North-Western Area. As a result of a Conference of representatives of the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative Employees and the North-Western Federation of Hours and Wages Board, it was agreed to submit this dispute to arbitration (See Reports for weeks ending the 1st, 8th, and 15th October).R.
