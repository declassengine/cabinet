The Report of the Commission for Foreign Affairs, concerning the motion of John Dabski and other members of the P.S.L. "Piast" club in the matter of a "provisional settlement" for Eastern Galicia.

 The House is requested to vote:

The Diet states: any provisional settlement in the legal relation of so called Eastern Galicia to the Polish Republic, whilst creating an unavoidable source of friction between Poland and the neighbouring states and rendering most difficult the re-establishment of harmony and peaceful life between the nationalities inhabiting this country as well as its economic reconstruction; would render impossible the fulfillment of the duties incumbent on Poland in the way of founding a durable peace in Europe.

The Diet requests the Government and the Polish Delegates to the Peace Conference in Paris to secure without delay the final reunion of Eastern Galicia to the Polish Republic, in accordance with the decisions of the Diet of May 23 1919, assuring to the Ukrainian population complete equality of rights and extensive autonomy, whilst finally opposing themselves to any provisional settlement in this matter.
