M?r&quot;TINGS 117 TTVP7&quot; PV?K.I Memorandum by jhe First Commi s, si oner ofIGeneral Kacready, the Commissioner cf police, has repre-, sented to me that in the interests of public order, meetings in Hyue park should net be allowed to continue into the hours of darkness, and he has suggested that in future such meetings should only be allowed to take place between sunrise and sunset-A copy cf the Commissioner&apos;s letter cf the Cth July last setting cut his reasons for the request is attached.If this request is to be complied with it will be necessary for me to issue a provisional rule under section 2 cf the Rules Publication Act 1893, but before dcing 60, I think the question should be carefully considered by the Cabinet as it is possible that such action may be severely criticised and considerable opposition may be experienced.f\ It is true that in the case of Trafalgar square such meetings can only be held in daylight, but it must be borne in mind that the right of public meetings in Hyde Park has been exercised for a very lon^; period of time, and it seem.3 very questionable particularly at the present time, whether it i3I   ; desirable to restrict the right in the way the Commissionerdesires.Trafalgar square is a public highway and there are obvious I objections therefore to the holding of such meetings there afterI      ,      dark, but though the reasons urged by the Commissioner forapplying the same rule as to the times of meetings in Hyde Park are of considerable weight and deserving of-every consideration, both with regard to the maintenance of public order and decency,, especially morals, it might, 1 think be contended that these reasons have always been applicable in the past, and that no sufficient grounds for a change are put forward.   It is not alleged by the Commissioner that any serious acts of violence and disorder are occurring his case is based rather on appre-hension..  It seems to me doubtful that a sufficiently strong case has been madeoIn these, circumstances, as this is a question affecting general policy, . I should be glad to have the ruling of the Cabinet as to whether they agree with a new rule being framed or whether they consider it better that no action should be taken.(Sgd,)   A, l CHD.P\F.^ Jpjj^cejof n^kjLi Storey1 s GaTeT sVf.9th October, 1919
OOPY\NEW SCOTLAND YARD, S.W.1.8th July, 1919.Sir,,1 am directed by the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis to acquaint you5 for the information of the First Commissioner of his &quot;Majesty1 s Works, etc, tha-t he is of opinion that there are grave objections, from the pMtit of view of public order, to the continuance of meetings in Hyde Park into the hours of darkness.&apos; hile nothing is further from the Commissioner&apos;s intention than to suggest interference with the recognised principle of free&apos; speech in the Park, he feels that some regulation in the matter of times and seasons is desirable and that it can be effected without violation of the principle,mentionedcThe First Commissioner will recognise that the concentration of large bodies of persons in a comparatively unlighted place, &apos;under conditions which ore calculated to excite prejudices and passions, presents a difficult problem to those responsible for the maintenance of order * A crowd, if kept under continual control, is not likely to develop   that particular orowd psychology which leads to riot, but the assertion of continual oontrol becomes . particularly difficult after dark, and for that reason the liability to disorder .is greatly increased. Opportunities are also given to pickpockets and other unck&quot;&quot;sizable characters, and altogether a situation is created which in the Commissioner s opinion is contrary to the public interest. &apos;The Commissioner has approached the subject with reluctance lest there be an appearance of interfering with free expression of opinion, but, being responsible for public order, he feels it necessary to suggest that the First Commissioner of His Majesty&apos;s Works,&quot;etc., should if possible, apply to Hyde Park a parallel restriction to that already existing in the oase of Trafalgar Square^ and limit the times of meeting to the hc-urs between sunrise and sunset.     He trusts that a regulation upon these lines will be found practicable.I am, Sir,Your obedient servant,(Signed) F.H. Underwood.for Secretary.cretary,..M.. Offioe of Works, Whitehall.
