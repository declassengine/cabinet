G.T. 8346.&apos;\                   &quot;/AH OABlPlUT. 11 * &quot;&quot;&quot;*......*......*THIS SYRIAN aJBSlSJ&apos;Communicated by      Clemenceau October ;K)thv19,19 *Reply to the -&quot;British Memorandum on Syria presented on Sept ember ijih&quot;by HrTLloyd &quot;George.1,      Between the French&quot;and the British in Asia Minor the      &apos; only basis for an understanding is the agreement of 19l6, which applies the declarations made by Sir Edward Grey in 1912. The conversations between Kr. Lloyd George and I. Clemenceau in December,1918 have remained without effect, since eventual concessions aa regards&apos; I osul and Palestine could only be considered if. equivalents were granted instead of &quot;the new concessions which are demanded. -The situation of Prance in Syria and her relations with the Arabs in. her zone can only be identical with the the situation of Great Britain in Mesopotamia and her relations with the Arabs in her zone. .   This exact parallelism results from the agreement at the foot of Which the two countries have placed their signature.   The fact that Great Britain has occupied.in the course of the war in the name of the Allies the. British zone and the French zone constitutes a do facto position which can no more modify the rights of the case in Asia than it could in Europe..2.      Between the Allies the questions of Syria and Mesopotamia will be definitely settled simultaneously with the fate of the territories of the Ottoman Empire,   Constantinople, Asia Tviinor and Armenia.    The traditional rights and interests of Great Britain and Prance.In their respective zones must not be impaired in any way.3.      The decision of the Supreme Council of l^th September 1919 has only sanctioned the acceptance by the French President of the Council of the proposals of the British Prime Minister as regards the replacement-of the British troops by French troops from the 1st November, in Oilicia and along the Syrian coast.   .It has boon expressly specified that this decision did not; imply.any French undertaking on any point of the British memorandum;/ and that without prejudice to the final solution Of &apos;the Mandates or the frontiers of the British or French zones, which will be examined as part &quot;of. the general Eastern problem.4.      The position of France and of Great Britain in regard ego the: Arab regions is defined more particularly: -By Article.1 of the agreement&apos;of 191c\ which declares that France and Great Britain are disposed &quot;to recognise and protect an independent Arab State.or a Confederation of Arab States in the zones A and B&quot;.
9 fi t* 6 / )2.    By the necessity recognised by the Conference of oonfiding to a European power &quot;a mandate Over the Arabs&quot; considered as still incapable of governing themselves as well in Syria as Mesopotamia, ,The special agreements between the British and the Arabs did not bind Franoej to whom the text of the agreements of Sir Henry McMahon with King Hussein in July and October 1915   have only been communicated in February 1919V as appears from the extracts from the Minutes themselves (which pre moreover vague, incomplete and not signed by our representative) communicated by Mr. Lloyd George *     Moreover these agreements cannot possibly modify the explicit terms of the last agreement, which is that of 1916,5.     The inclinations of&apos; the French Government, resolved to apply in a liberal manner the promises of assistance with regard to the Arab State included in their mandate, would permit them to come to an understanding with the Emir Feisal direct if the latter did not continue to enjoy British protection, in consequence of a conception which invalidates our. agreements.     It is the business of France to come to an understanding herself with the Arabs in her zone, as it is Great britain&apos;s business with regard to her zone) on the general principles which have been agreed upon and without either of the Powers interfering in the mandate of the other.6.     The replacement of the, British troops by French troops can only be effected without risk and without disorder if the two movements are carried on simultaneously * ,-&apos;  To exclude the French troops from the interior zone of Syria and from the towns of Aleppo and Damascus would be as opposed to the agreements of 1916 as if it were demanded that the   rab troops should occupy the towns in zone B to the exclusion of the British.    How could France take over the responsibility from the British command and have even a.possibility of exercising her mandate if she was not in a position to intervene in case of disturbances?   And how could we treat with Feisal if the British champion his cause and constitute the. selves with regard to him guarantors of the under-taking to exclude us from the interior zone?   It is we whose business it is to come to an understanding with Feisal in agreeing to limit our occupation if he   successfully undertakes to maintain order in Damascus, Horns, Hama and Aleppo....   The protection guaranteed by Great Britain for Feisal&apos;s independence in the French zone is an intrusion in our Syrian mandate which cannot be reconciled; with our agreements&quot;..7..   The frontiers between Palestine and Syria were determined by the agreement of 1916 after a detailed study in which the interests of the two regions were taken into account.,.  To make them go beyond the latitude of Tyre and.almost up to the suburbs of Damas-cus would deprive Syria of a certain number of its. most fertile regions, and of its most courageous populations under conditions which neither Christians nor Arabs would accept. -However, certain rectifications uould be agreed to after an examination on the spot by a mixed commission of delimitation which would take into - account geographical, and,ethnical considerations.,The other limits between the British mandate and the French mandate are easy to determine,,for they are imposed by nature.. Should the concession as regards Mosul be agreed to, France would retain to the south and to the north the limits of 1916, to the east the basin of the Kabcur and of its tributaries..
8.     The survey cf the railway from Haifa to zone E in no way compels any modification of&quot; the terms cf Article 7 of the agreement of 1916.     This letter meets the Fritish requirements and has. provided that in case of technical difficulties of construction the line may cress a fixed \erimeter&apos; of the French zone A.     If it was allowed &apos;tp carry it up to the latitude of Deir-es-Zor the Alexandretta Railway might be deprived at.will of all value,;and the sole object of the understanding on this point would be lost si$ht&apos;of, which was to connect Haifa and Baghdad by a line under British sovereignty - passage over a point of the French zone being only provided for tu avoid.a technical   .impossibility. It,is quite&apos;understood teat.the part of the ,zone of the French mandate which may eventually be traversed would not pass under British control, ail facilities for c istruction, exploitations and improvements being secured to the P-ritish Government and the French Government being resolved to fu-fil in a liberal spirit the undertakings  iven in 1916.9.     The question of oil and of pipe lines for its transport is bound up with the very important concession of Mosul:   the French Government has already indicated and now confirms that the essential equivalent   claimed by French business interests and by the French Parliament is strict equality in the exploitation of the oil of Mesopotamia and Kurdistan.     This point possesses a capital importance by reason of france^ lack of oil and her needs in this respect i&apos;yiin this reservation, agreement as to the eventual abandon- .. ment of Mosul and all facilities for the construction of pipe lines traversing the French mandate could be acquired,
