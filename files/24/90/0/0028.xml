Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.The object of the Combines Bill is to bring Combines of every description under investigation and to give the Board of Trade power, where it is thought desirable in the public interest to do so, to control their operations.The Bill empowers the Board of Trade, if satisfied as the result of enquiry made either on their own initiative or on a complaint made to them that there is prima facie     i evidence (a) that a combine exists or is about to be formed; and (b) that an investigation is desirable in the public interest, to order an investigation,A Combine is defined as &quot;any organisation connected with production, tradef finance, distribution, transport, storage or the ownership of real property, which, has for its purpose or effect the regulation of the price or output of commodities produced in or imported into the United rtingdom, or of services rendered in connexion therewith, or the de-limitation of markets in respect thereof, or the regulation of the importation of commodities into the.United Kingdom, or the regulation of transport or storage rates or services, or the obtaining of a monopoly or substantial control over any trade or industry or    branch of any trade or industry or any process of manufacture or the regulation of the dis-posal of real property,.by means of any trust merger or amalgamation, or of any combination, association, agreement or arrangement actual or tacit&apos;1.,,   Monopoly or substantial control by a single company,.firm or individual is also covered by the definition.&apos;When&apos;an investigation is ordered by the Board of Trade it is to be conducted through a Commission appointed under the Bill and unless the Board of Trade in any cases other-wise direct is to be held in public.    Every Commission so appointed must report to the Board of Trade and the Board are required to publish the finding,, and also, if they think fit, the report or any part thereof.If satisfied as the result of such investigation that a Combine within the meaning of the Bill exists and that ^ such action is desirable in the public interest the Board may by order specifically apply Section 3 of the Bill to a Combine.    The Order must be&apos;laid before both Houses of parliament and an address by either House within a specified period against the Order invalidates it.    If no such address is moved the Board of Trade are, by means of directions given and published in the Gazette, to have power with regard to the combine and its members and any articles produced or sold or any services rendered by the Combine or its members or any industry controlled or&apos; dominated by the.Combine,/
(a) to fix or regulate prices, (b) to require that sales or services shall not be withneld (i.e, to prevent a boycott), (c) to prohibit or restrict the imposition of conditions of sales or the rendering of services and (d) to prohibit any person from dealing unless licensed in any commodity affected by the operation of the combine. Any such directions (which may be conditional) so given by the Board of tade are to be complied with notwith-standing contractual oommitmonto between the parties.6. Tho Bill gives full power to obtain all necessary information to take evidence on oath etc. and imposes severe penalties for an offence under Clause 3, and smaller penalties for other offences.I should be glad to receive sanction for the in-troduction of this Bill into Parliament at an early date.A.Q.
