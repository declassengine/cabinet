It is reported that the miners in one of the coalfields are planning for a big general strike in January next.   The question of a coal reserve is therefore urgent.   On the other hand, Labour Leaders admit that the rank and file have not yet been converted to nationalisation.ftAn attempt i3 being made to manufacture a crisis Cut of the exclusion of Agriculture from the Eight Hours Bill, though that exclusion has been known for months.   The object is, of &apos; course, to defeat the project of the Joint Industrial Council, because it would make a general strike well-nigh impossible.There is a movement on foot to amalgamate the Unions ofthe/Report Jo. 25(Home Office)Scotland House, S.Y/.1. 16th October, 1919.KgJPORH?

Mr. Carter; the organizer of the Committee^ outlined the future polioy of the NationalUnion of ateilwaymen as follows:   &quot;We must insist on the election&apos; of supervisors, foremen, station-mastersand/
and Inspectors from the rank and file, and leave only the appointment of directors, and managers to the Government.&quot; rFor tills purpose a strong propaganda * -campaign is. to be initiated.   He further said that he was in touoh with the Goal Miners and was oertain that the rsnk and file were not in favour of Nationalisation;&apos; it needed a very strong movement. &quot; 1 tKl.il l&amp; ato convert them.   The.general sense was that thenext fight .would be on the question of nationalisation of Mines and Hallways, and that if the Governmentohose. to have the fight now,it would find the railwaymen . quite devoid of a polioy.As an illustration of how far the influenoe ofthe Extremists has gone, it.may be mentioned thatbodies such as the CentrajL labour College,, theBritish Sooialiat Party, the Co-operative Societies,the [Herald. League and ifoe National Union offtailwaymen are nOd holding olasses and it isproposed to hold joint olasses in the provinces.On Qotober 11th, at a meeting of the V/est Hamlabour Party, Er. C.T,.Cramp, President of the.National.Union of. JBailwaymen, said:&quot;The time has oome when we ought to &quot;consider1 whether It isnot possible even to &quot;widen the basis of our constitution, whether &quot;the in^iSfeild^uttlV^e- f&amp;r as we are,.. &quot;xonoerned, ought not,to be a Transport &quot;Workers&apos; union&quot;, allowing for separate,.;  &quot;autonomy, the. men and women employed on., &quot;railways, on motor transport, on practically &quot;everything which has to do with the carriage &quot;ubf goods and&apos; pt;ss&apos;eh&apos;ger8 s&amp;x-any commodities &quot;whatsoever, whether we ought not to be &quot;orgenized with one directing oentre in order &quot;that, they may be ultimately used to ward off &quot;any attacks which may be made upon us, or, . &quot;any.section,,of us.&quot;The Idea, of a &quot;General Staff&quot; for Labour is still being, discussed, and on the whole there may be, some advantage in haHng all the plans for- ....       u j, ...      ; - . x \j    j a       j f. ij .direct.action, concentrated under one roof. he/   *
ttie People&apos;0 League has issued a memorandum in whioh they propose that no strike should be legal unless preceded by a seoret ballot, and that, before this is taken, notice of it must be given to the Minister of Labour.   The suggestion is made that, failing a settlement, a statement of the causes shall be published in the press for a olear 14 days.A mass meeting of Mil grades of raUwaymen atwclverhampton is reported to have adopted unanimouslya resolution Informing their general secretaries oftheir &quot;absolute dissatisfaction&quot; with the terms ofthe recent settlement.   It was further resolved that:&quot;Unless Messrs. Cramp&apos;s and Thomas&apos; &quot;interpretation is next week plaoed on the &quot;settlement, the whole of the railmen, transport &quot;workers and miners make common cause in a &quot;quick and deoiatv9 fight for standardisation, &quot;and general advances to all, in whioh event &quot;they resolve not to return without knowledge &quot;of the actual terms agreed.&quot;Strong opposition to the Citizen Guard has been expressed by the workers,   on October 9th, at a meeting of the London Trades Council, a resolution was moved calling upon the Government immediately to disband the Civilian Guard.   In proposing the resolution, Mr. Pinnell advised Trades Unionists to organize for their own proteotion, because the (Joverument had been organizing their forces slnoe 1911 against the Trade Unionist Movement.    A similar resolution was passed unanimously at a reoent meeting In Edinburgh, where a member of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers protested against the formation of a blackleg guard, whioh was not even drawn from the Navy, Army or Polioe.On October 12th, at a large &quot;Hands off Ireland&quot; meeting in the 31. Andrew&apos;s Hall, Glasgow, one ofthe/
the speakers is reported to have deolared that if theauthorities proceeded with the &quot;White Guard,&quot; theworkers would form a &quot;j&apos;ied Guard.&quot;On October 9th, the railwaymen of &quot;^ed Fetrograd1transmitted, through the xcussian Wireless stations, &apos;a message which stated that the news of the strike hadbeen, heard with joy and enthusiasm.   Aftercongratulating their British comrades on their adoption of direct aotion as one of the best methodsof warfare thejmeesage goes on as follows:&quot;British railwaymen, you have deolared a &quot;general strike, -;but this is not enough,   It is &quot;neoess&amp;ry totoke a step forward.   You must pass &quot;from a general strike tc an armed rising.   In &quot;order.to improve your econoiaio position you &quot;roust first destroy the present Imperialist order &quot;of bhingS, and substitute for it a Government of &quot;Workers and Peasants,&quot;Your Government endeavours to break your &quot;ranks by recruiting blacklegs.   But do not lose &quot;heart&quot;,   icemain firm, and do not allow the &quot;leaders of the old Trade Union school to get at &quot;the head of the movement, as they would betray &quot;you at the last decisive moment.   Victory is &quot;yours if you fight to the end.&quot;As to ourselves, we shall hold out to the &quot;last breath.   We will not allow to slip from ., &quot;our hands the conquests whioh have been won by vv ; &quot;us.   We will fight until the whole world is &quot;oovered with ried Flags.   Down with the League &quot;of Nations.   Long live British Soviet Power.&quot;AMALGAMATION OF MGINh^^ING BOCIISTiaSThe result of the ballot on the amalgamation ofthe Unions in the iingineering Trades will not bepublished for some weeks, but general opinionanticipates a large majority in favour of amalgamation^   The scheme was approved by theConference held at York in &quot;tvlay 1918.   If the schemetakes effect, the membership will be 480,000, or rather more than that of the National Union ofnailwaymen, and the amalgamated funds will amountto/   f
-i to nearly four million, the largest sum possessed byany Trades Union or Federation in this country.   The yearly se-laries proposed are:   Chairman of the________-Executive, Counotl,  450; General Secretary,  450;Full Time Officials,  400. , (ienerous provision is to be made for the compensation of local secretaries who will lose their employment.The election of Tom Mann to the Secretaryship of the Amalgamated Society of iiJngineers shows the preponderance of jUxtremists in the Engineering Trades. But in his varied career as publican,, would-be Church of England clergyman, &quot;Communist,&quot; &quot;Bolshevik&quot; and &quot;Spartacist&quot; (to use his own description) Mr. Mann has found it so easy to. adapt himself to circumstances and to trim his sails to the prevailing wind that too much importance should not be given to the Views that he happens to hold for the moment.   His election was curious, because it is perfectly well-known in Labour circles that he will do nothing without money.   His friends think that his present offioe - salary and pickings - will amount to little less than  2,000 a , year.Qgti&amp;i AMALGAMATIONS ./Amalgamation is in. the air.   The Vehicle Workers and the Bolton Carters&apos;, Lorry-men&apos;s and kotormen&apos;s Union have been amalgamated under the. title of &quot;The United Vehicle Workers.&quot;   The membership of the new Union amounts to j$f of the organized Vehicle Workers,The members of the Boilermakers1, Blacksmiths&apos; and Shipwrights&apos; Societies have also.voted by large majorities for amalgamation.
ituitaaair in     post pjn^ 1Information is being constantly received that there is great restlessness among the lower ranks of the Postal employees.   It is significant that members of the Post Office Engineering Staff are now being drawn into the fileotrical Trades Union.   A very intelligent Postal employee,just returned from the war, is astonished at the increase of revolutionary sentiment that he has found among his oollea&amp;ues sinoe his re&apos;turn.   He attributes it to what he calls the woocen and soulless way in whioh the small grievances of the men are met by their immediate superiors; and, drawing upon his Army experience, he thinks that much of this would be removed if some system could be devised for the smaller grievanoes of the men being carried directly to the ears of the higher.officials and remedied,   he thinks that what is really lacking is the appearance of personal interest in their welfare.The statement in my lest report, that Mr. Smillie^ reason for not allowing the miners to take part in the railway strike was his desire to oonserve his funds and forces for nationalisation, reoeives Bupport from the utatement of Mr. Prank Hodges at the Albert Hall on October 11th, when he said that the miners had a definite strategic policy, and that within the next three months the loyalty of the workers might be put to the test.   A special Trades Union Congress is likely to be held after the return of the British Delegates from Washington, and if it is in favour of nationalisation a general strike will probably be oalled.   Meanwhile, a great oampaign of propaganda/
9 9 i e) tj&apos; 1mm    &quot;J   *mpropaganda in favour of nationalisation is to be undertaken, and the National Union of xtailwaytfen is reported to have set aside  20,000 for film propaganda. The neoessity of providing a ooal reserve, as euggested in my last report, is therefore urgent.THE HOUSING- FdOBLBM &apos;Labour has been quiok to seize on the housing problem as propaganda for the November eleotions.*The delay in oarrying out the Government housing soherne has been one of the chief complaints at strike and labour meetings.   The grievance of the workers is real and the unrest caused by the laok of housing accommodation oannot be exaggerated.The situation oan be gauged from the reports from the following towns and distripts. ffottinfihamUy correspondent reports that the housing situation is very serious.The Nottingham City Council has now decided to make a beginning by building 500 to 600 houses and to watch results before proceeding with the various building schemes.   This number is muoh critioised by the workers, as the number of houses required by the oity ia between 3000 and 4000.   A satisfactory settlement of the housing question would go far to alleviate the unrest predominant among ex-soldiers who usually are not attracted by general politioa. Manchester DistrictI am informed that great indignation has been aroused in the Itfanchester district through the praotioe of selling houses over the tenants&apos; heads, when it ia impossible for them to obtain other houses in whioh to live/
live. iLeedsIn Leeds disatisfaction is felt on aooount of j alleged attempts made by Conservative and Liberal members of the Munioipal bodies.to.defeat Labour housing proposals and to.allow erection of picture houses. GlasgowTho Glasgow Corporation has deoided to proceed with the ereotion of 500 wooden houses to relieve tl present acute shortage of aooommodation. Very litt headway is being made with the construction of penni dwellings, owing to the delay in obtaining offioial sanction to plans and the soaroity of material, and the heavy oost of building. CardiffThe Cardiff Corporation estimates that 3 *000 h are required to satisfy the need  of the oity and a preliminary scheme involving the construction of 21 houses is now being carried out. The housing probl is rendered all the more urgent owing to the recent outbreak of scarlet fever in the oity; many workers compelled to live in houses where isolation is impo Birmingham,   The Birmingham Labour,Party states that 50,000 houses are neoessary to meet the requirements of Birmingham.labour, according to its published polioy, req the Municipalities to build the necessary houses, polioy is &quot;absolutely opposed to subsidies from pu* funds to private ventures&apos;of any description,&quot; and general principle &quot;believes that the State should!upon all looal Authorities building, through theirWO!
Works department, their share of the million housesrequired, and that loans for this purpose should be advanced by the State to the public   authorities free of interest.&quot;FESLING AMONG DiaCKAa&amp;ap SOLDIfiflSThe demonstration held in Victoria Park on October 12th, in favour of granting free land and baok pay at the rate paid to the Australian troops, was poorly attended and lacked enthusiasm.   The speakers inoluded ! Mr. C.T. Cramp and Mr. Duncan carmichael,   Cramp promised the National Union of .ilx-Servioe Men the support of 450,000 railwaymen.   Carmichael said that fifty millions had been wasted in one week in the railway strike, and yet the Government refused to give five shillings baok pay to the soldiers.   On the whole, there appears to be the same division of opinion among discharged soldiers as in the civilian population -many sympathised with the railwaymen during the strike and others oame to the assistance of the community. The Extremists are doing their utmost to deny that any discharged soldiers were guilty cf &quot;blaoklegging.M&quot;HANDS OFF iflJSSIA&quot;*The Extremists have been upset by the withdrawal of the British troops from Russia, and are now concentrating on the demand that munitions shall not be supplied; but it was noticeable at the Albert Hall meeting on Ootober 11th, whioh was addressed by Mrs. Snowden, Mr. r&amp;msay Maodonald and Mrs. Besant, that all the enthusiasm and excitement displayed by the audience at former meetings had died down.&quot;HANDS OFF INLAND&quot;Mr. George Lansbury has been blamed for givingmore/
more prominence to &quot;Hands off Russia&quot; than to British &quot;Intervention in Ireland.&quot;  He has promised to obtalifl the Albert akali for the 15th November for a demons tratl for self-determination in Ireland.   On October 12th a demonstration took plaoe in Glasgow/ and addresses wed feiven, among others, by Commander Kenworthy, Mr. Neil McLean, Mrs. 3heehy Skeffington and Connoi1lora.. Shinwell.        .......... v. ,   .Mi4. Joseph, Keating, the prospective Labour Candidl for Aberdare, is conducting, a campaign on the Govemmel Irish policy, whioh is reported to. be meeting with soul success among the miners.      ,        , 9The oold weather has put an end&quot; to open-air meeti in the North of  togland, and the iSxtremiBts are now oonduoting study classes and small&apos; indoor meetings.   1 revolutionaries. who had hegun to see the red flag floating over Town Halls, have been temporarily paralysed by the obllapse of the railway strike.   They talk darkly of the great battle which is to oome. Against tee patriotic persons who oame to the aid of the community during ;the strike&apos;they have nothing but derision.   At Bradford the strike has resulted in on increase of membership for the Independent Labour Part, At the Keir Hardie Memorial Servioe on the 5th October, a Mr. Herron made a violent, attack upon constitutional Trades Unions, whioh he, said only meant .   the growth of bureaucracy and the payment of offioials and if Mr. Sidney Webb and his group had got into powe it would have been &quot;God  help the    working olasses.&quot; He oi .ed the police strike and said that if Labour had been solid in favour of the strike there wouldhave/
99 9 i) tJ 0- 11 -have been great possibilities.   &quot;Now.&quot; he added, &quot;where was the policeman who would aid Labour?&quot;It is rather significant that Mr. J,B. V/ilson, known as Jopk Wilson, a prominent member of the Industrial Workers of the World in Australia and a deportee from the Commonwealth, in spite of his violent speeohes, is apparently trying to gain an lnfluenoe over the moderate seotion by advising resort to parliamentary aotion.MA. ARTHUR HmfiBSCN. M.P.  -   &apos;    &apos;It is reported that Mr. Arthur Henderson is very unpopular among the ironfounders in the lyneside area, and there is a movement on foot to get him to resign his position as Honorary President of the Ironfounders&apos; Sooiety.THE * DAILY HEHALD&quot;Mr, Lansbury is malting a very strong appeal for funds to get the circulation of his paper up to a million. In its present form, almost destitute of advertisements, an lnoreased circulation means a further loss.   He disclaimed on October 11th haviog received a penny from any &quot;German Baron&quot; or &quot;Amerioan agitator,&quot; but he makes no allusion to Indian agitators.   The &quot;Morning Post&quot; is pursuing the question of his finances and has called attention to Mrs. Besanfs shares.   Her explanation of the gift of 6,248 paid up  1 shares is not very convincing.The &quot;Herald&quot; goes to press early, in order to get oopies to the North of England, and for this reason its news is out of date as oompared with that of the otferer newspapers.   In consequence of the oomplaints that the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; did not cater for looal labour news, a weekly labour paper oalled the &quot;Town Crier&quot; has appeared in Birmingham.   It is edited by Mr. W.J, Chamberlain,     / who wa3 a conscientious objeotor and an organizer ofthe/
the No-Consoription -Fellowship. ^At the Church Congress, Mr. Lanabury was chali about his attitude towards Lenin and Litvinoff, and defence he said thai he was merely a correspondent that he held their enormities in strong repugnance, the &quot;hands off -Russia&quot; meeting at the Albert Hall, already alluded to, the Hall was decorated with advert!nementa of the &quot;Herald,&quot; and the whole meet in appeared to be rather a &quot;Herald&quot; advertisement than movement in favour of. Soviet rtuaaia.THIS CONVICTION p-F iflDV/AriD CLA^SThe case of Clarges, to whioh I referred in my1 report of Ootober 2nd, has been taken up by the &quot;Workers Dreadnought&quot; and the &quot;Daily Herald.&quot;   The first named has opened a fund for an Appeal to the High Court.   The appeal is supported by various officials of the Portsmouth Labour Party and PortsM Independent Labour Party,   The. leaf let whioh Clargesl distributed, &quot;British Workers - What are you going t( do?&quot; bears a bogus imprint and winds up on the key, , &quot;Bit no trust in Parliament ........ Prepare to takelDirect Action ...... Get ready for the evolution!&quot;I&amp;SLANDExcept for the continued lawlessness in Clares the East aiding of Cork things have been very quiet, The undercurrent of disloyalty is still strong, but several counties the polioe believe that the people beginning t6 lose&apos; their enthusiasm for Sinn Fein and growing tired of its repeated appeals for money. Si Fein propaganda, however, is reported to have inorea in Ulster.The settlement of the railway strike in EnglandIbeen welcomed everywhere exoept by the extreme aintrelem
element, which had hoped to turn to aooount the ppread Qf the disaffection to Ireland.   Information has been reoeived that in Louth aohemea were oonaidered forblowing up railway bridges and portions of the permanent way.   The settlement has no doubt spoilt their plans.At present Sinn Fein is seoretly busy arranging for the National Assembly of Sinn Fein, which is to be held in Dublin on l6th Instant.None of the recognised 3inn Fein papers have, as yet, resumed publication.In the North of Ireland the press references to the Government&apos;s reported Home ^tule plans are said to be oausing considerable speculation.  Unionists are quietly organizing and gathering themselves again into clubs, but there is no talk of arming or drilling as yet.dhere is no real tendency to Bolshevism in Ireland up to the present, nor is it likely to gain much hold on the people.B.

APPENDIXNATIONAL, UNION &apos; OF riaJLWAYMSff LONDON PIgTxtlOT COUNCIL119, Harviet,. itoad,West Xilburn,i  if.w.6. October 8th, 1919.To the President,- Delegates and members of Branches. Fellow Members,In view &quot;of our-experiences of the past two weeks, I think it advisable for the future guidance of our members to briefly outline what has been done in London during the strike period, and to offer a few suggestions as to what should be done before another railway strike takes place.When I heard definitely that a strike was imminent, I&apos;immediately summoned a fill meeting of the Counoil. This was held on Friday, September 25th, at 5.30 p.m.  -As a result of that meeting it was decided to hold a further meeting on Saturday morning and throw it open to all branohes in the London district,   The meeting was exceptionally well attended, and it was arranged to hold meetings daily whilst the strike lasted.   This was very wise, for right through the strike period the meetings &apos; were well attended and much assistance rendered and difficulties disoussed.   From amongst the delegates present at the Saturday morning meeting, a Central Strike Executive Committee was appointed under the Chairmanship of districts of London,   The Committee was further enlarged     representatives of the A.S.L.2. &amp; F, and Electrioal Trades Union.   One first difficulty experienced was to find a room suitable for a strike headquarters, and it was here that Mr. 0. Lansbury came to our assistance and offered us a room at 2, Gough Square, the business offioea of the &quot;Daily Herald. Mr. Lansbury took very great risks in allowing us the use of this room, for it was quite possible for the police to oome and seal the premises with disastrous results to the paper.   Any way, everything went off all right, but London railwaymen are under a deep sense of gratitude to Mr. Lansbury for having &quot;taken the risk. We were made to feel at home and every facility was offered for our work in the use of the &quot;phone, typewriter, etc   It was also due to the &quot;Herald&quot; staff that we were able to use their motor cars to get several provincial members who were stranded back to their homes.   We should also like to thank the Smithfield branch for allowing us the use of their room for our daily delegate meeting, and for supplying messengers, etc, at Oough Square, also the many other branches who assisted in this direotipn.   Whilst on the subject of meeting rooms, it is as well to note that several branohes were turned out of theirbranch/
branch rooms because the men were on strike. It would 1 be as well if immediate steps were taken to get places ;; where people will have us in times of stress, as well % as when we are playing the role of sane trade unionist?;] This is equally necessary for the Counoil to consider.-The  hceoutive Committee sat continuously at Gough j-Square, -throughout the strike, the natural aptitude of railwayman for shift work standing them in good stead. :,The great possibilities and advantages of the Central Strike Committee were quickly reoognised by Unity House, who handed over letters for distribution, and gave information so that we oould keep members posted as to what was being done.   We were also asked to undertake the responsibility re feeding and watering of horpes, the question of issuing permits and the care of stranded members.   I should here like to pay a tribute to our branches for their loyalty in obeying without question the many instructions issued by the Committee.   The scope of this report will not allow ev a brief referenoe to the many knotty problems we had to taokle, but the Committee gave of their best, and by the many letters already received from branohes and strike committees, the work of the Committee was appreciated.During the latter part of the strike, a very successful attempt was made to inaugurate a postal service between the Central Committee and the looal strike committees.   About seventeen distribution centres were agreed upon and from these cyclists were sent to Gough Square, eaoh evening, to oarry back letters which were then distributed to all quarters. The great possibilities of the scheme prompt  me to urge you to give the matter your olose attention so that a plan oan be adopted for use on any future occasion.   We distributed a lot of literature in this way, and letters from all parts of IDngland,One of the worst defeots of our present organizatip beoame very apparent during the strike.   I refer to the area covered by the District Counoil.   whilst it may be possible for some to make a case out in normal times for London and district to be divided into different iDistriQt Counoils , in a time like that through whioh we have just passed arbitrary areas quickly disappear, making it quite natural for branches to link up for the purpose outlined above, for meetings, demonstrations, and for purposes we shall outline later.   As Secretary,&quot; I quickly realised that our lack of knowledge of branohes in the London area not affiliated to the Council was a great disadvantage on such an important occasion , and made our work rather patchy.   I do seriously suggest that an immediate attempt should be made to federate the whole of the Distriot Counoils in the South of -ingland.   The area is not so very large, and I am confident that nothing but good oan result.ijven in the early stages of the fight the Committee recognised the need for preparations being made to deal with any cases of real hardship amongst our members which might arise.   The question wee referred to the London Joint Advisory Council of Trade Unionists and&quot;&apos;&quot; Co-operators/
Co-operators and it is a real pleasure to report the spontaneous nature of the support whioh was forthcoming from both trade union and co-operative friends.   Obviously in a question of this character a certain amount of discretion had to be used to prevent abuse of any arrangements made to relieve distress, but whilst we worked quietly, had the strike lasted but a few days longer we should have had all the branches grouped according to the different Co-operative Sooieties areas, the necessary finanoial guarantees fixed up and a scheme in operation to deal with any oases whioh might arise. Here again is work for the Council to make plan3 so that directly another strike takes plaoe a soheme can be brought into immediate operation ,Comrades, the ntrike must have taught us many things.   The solidarity of our men in London ha3 been splendid and been adraifced by many members from the provinoOB.   This is in no small measure due to the work performed during the past few years.   We of the London Council should be proud men to-day, for the result of the strike from the standpoint of organization alone should give us great satisfaction.   I do not mean by this that we were perfect, we have seen the value of organization and co-ordination, and it is beoause of this fact that I issue this brief report for the express purpose of us discussing the whole position, profiting by our experiences and placing on reoord some tangible plans for use on the next occasion.   We haven&apos;t finished with railway strikes, the one just ended is but the first round of the battle for the emancipation of railway workers.Yours fraternally,(Signed)   W.Q?.A, FootSecretary.
