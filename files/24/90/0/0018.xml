*   sobjsct.... mm. ^Wlw 1*1?10th September, lyiy.)lo.Z .554/6126. Sir,I have the honour to submit for the information of Their Lordships that tho future of Cyprus is a matter of great con-cern and interest to the Mediterranean Coramander-in-Chief, ana j before a decision is given, I feel it my duty to lay before Their Lordships the result of enquiries made from persons with exper-ience of the Island, and who have studied the question.2,-     It is not supposed that any new features are disclosed in these short notes, they are set forth to show the reasons why I have come to the conclusion that it is all important for us to retain this Island, a view that I think Their Lordships share and will press to the utmost in the right quarter.3.- The considerations-which have- led me to arrive at this conclusion are as follows and they may be classified -under three headings namely 1 *,a) Naval considerations b) Air considerations ,c) Political considerations.(a) faaLji^^ of Gyprua-i.4.-     The naval advantages are i-(a) Cyprus is ideally placed for the concentration of troops, subject to efficient escort, for,.operations, on the Coasts cf. Syria or Asia Minor.   ..&apos;(bj Is a suitable base for light craft such as Coastal Motor Beats inside - and in fine weather lestroyers outside such a port as Famagusta, protected by a bank.(c) Can.be used as an advanced fuelling and supply base, with possible adequate protection and as a Base fcr Auxiliary Patrol Craft.Air,.Advantages derived from cur possession of Cyprus.5.-     Plenty of good aerodromes can be found on a large plain running East and West across the island, between the mountain ranges, North and South of it, and an aerodrome can be found close to Famagusta Port, easily accessible for stores, or, if it is considered that the aerodrome should be inland, to avoid bombard-ment, a suitable site can be found close to the Capital town of Nicosia,Should it be thought that the lake at Limasol may some day have to be converted to a seaplane station, it might be preferred lc pljce the aerodrome there also, a site could easily be found but this locality is acmewhat inaccessible and seaplanes pro-ceeding North would have to cross a mountain range 6,000 feet in height.On the whole I would recommend that the aerodrome be placed at Famagusta. &apos;6.7 I be$ to bring to your notice the important strategic position occupied by the British inland of Cyprus, particularly as regards the employment of aircraft.This island lies almost on the direct line between Taranto and Karachi, and it may very likely be found desirable to use itSt. ,in duplicate.)cretary of the Admiralty, nq(^Whitehall,London,   sill, &apos; &apos;   asMediterranean No.4.554/0126 of 18th Sept. 1919.
as a re-fuelling station on the&apos; England to. India and Mosfp^ianaa Air Route.An examination of the portion of that route lying between Athens and Baghdad reveals the fuct that it is no less than 400 miles shorter to fly via Rhodes-Cyprus and Damascus than it is to follow the present route via Crete, Sollum, Marsa, Matru, Cairo and Damascus.    This is also a safer route to follow, as it involves no long flight over sea away from any islands or land, as is met with in the 200 mile flight &quot;between Crote and Sollum. A small landing ground already exists in the island of Kos, near Rhodes, and good level ground can also be found at Patara.7.-     Again, Cyprus lies close to country where unsettled conditions may bo expected to exist for a considerable time.   The distance from Famagusta to Beirut is only 110 miles, to Alexandretta 130 miles, to Mersina 100 miles, to the railway junction at Aleppo only 175 miles.Two aeroplanes working from Cyprus could, in a single day. examine the whole  00 miles of coast between Beirut and Cape&quot;&apos;Anamur in Asia Minor.    A patrol along the whole coast from Beirut to Port Said could also be oarried out in one flight.These facts point to Cyprus holding a most&apos; important strategic position in the Levant.(c) Political advarit^ros....dsrivod from,,our possession flf Cyprus.0.-     The political peasons which ronder the retention of Cyprus as an integral portion oi. the British Empire desirable, may be ilisaded into two categories, namely       -(a) Direct advantages of Cyprus to Great Britain.(b) Disadvantages to Great Britain were Cyprus in the handsof a potentially hostile power or of a weak country which&apos; might be brought under the influence of a hostile power.9.-     Direct advantages may be summarised under the following heads, and can in most cases be illustrated from the late war.(i) Man-power,    The total population of the island is now approximately307.000.   Conscription was not applied during the war, but Cypr/iotes were recruited by voluntary&apos;enlistment for service with the Salonika army as muleteers and transport drivers. Some 12,000 men were thus engaged and proved of considerable use, not only as muleteers but as releasing for combatant duties British Troops that would otherwise have had to be employed on this work. Enlistment was popular with the people, and could no doubt be repeated on a larger scale were the necessity to arise again, ]ii) MJjaaraiaf &quot;Cyprus produced asbestos, copper, copper sylphate, (used for the manufacture of sulphuric acid), gypcum, salt, burnt umber,,and.-smaIl quantities oi magn/wsite,. Traces of oil nave been f6und and the question, of its presence in appreciable quantities is s Jill, I understaruL under examlnatietu  As regards asbestos, the m:.nes are a going c6no*rn, and during the war an annual average 6f 25,000 pwt. worth about  14,000. was oxported to the United Kingdom and British possessions.    In 1915 an American company was granted a mining lease for copper and copper rulphate, and would have shipped considerable quantities of both minerals but for the impossibility of obtaining freight during the war. The sulphuric acid would probably be of value to Epypt.    Salt, which is a Government monopoly, is collected in ample quantities (fi from the salt lakes of Larna&amp;a and.Lima^o-1.(Ill)  lack
(iii) fitook.,   Cyprus is noted for its breed ofmules an i j on net a,&apos; and supplied these to the Array during the Crimean War, Abyssinian Campaign, Egyptian Campaign of 1882, and the late war.   Tho Cyprus mule is enduring and docile, and is espocially useful for artillery purposes,    The island supplied goats during tho war to Indian troops, and its *v excellent breed of sheep; f&amp;i?m a useful food receive,(iv) Grain.i   Cyprus grows excellent wheat and barley the latter being especially good.     In peace time the excess of barley over tho local requirements is shipped to England for malting purposes; during the war large purchases of wheat and barley were made by the Salonika and Egyptian Expeditionary--Porces i(v) l*orage6m The island&apos;s principal export is the Caroub bean/^&apos;ETcii&quot;&quot;i3 used in the composition of cattle foodso   During the war the total island crop was bought each year by the Military Authorities as forage for zmloa.(vi) Potato08jp-flio cultivation of potatoes in Cyprus has greatly Increased sinco the outbreak of the war, during the latter part of which tho Army bcught potatoes to the annual Talus of  100,000*(vii). Timber and fv,el*   TTns Cyprus forests, whose resources are as yet scarcely &quot;capped; are particularly useful in a part of the world which is largely denuded of timbers    Egypt has no forests, while those of Asia Minor and Syria, already much reduced before the war. by wasteful felling, and absence of organisation, are probably, by now, almost non-existent.     luring the latter part of the war the Palestine Porce met its heavy timber and fuel requirements wholly from Cyprus.(viii) Other eoonnnio products.   Among the economic products which the island ereppros are fruit and raisin3, wine and brandy, linseed, oosarao. cotton, silk, etc.,   Raisins were supplied in large quantities during the war to the Army,Prom the above it will be seen that Cyprus oan supply much that is essential, and difficult to obtain readily from elsewhere, to a British Army operating in tho Hear East,10.      A point not to be overlooked is the value of the island as a Sanatorium or Summer Station for Egypt, The climate in the plains is delightful except during tho hot season (June to September inclusive)$ while the summer resort of Troodos, situated amid pine forests at a height of 6f000 feet, i3 similar to the Engadine as a health resort, and is unique in the i\ear east.   There is now very little Malaria in Cyprus, especially since the anti-malarial campaign inaugurated toy Sir Ronald Ross in 1913.11*        The communications of the island are good. There are 76 miles of narrow gauge railway, 800 mile of main roads (mostly suitable for motor traffic), and 1000 miles of secondary roads012. Further, Cyprus, lying as it docs over againstHersinao....,
Mersina and Aloxandretta, which may he regarded as western termini of tho Baghdad Railway, might well, in the hands of a hostile power, bo used ao a place whence to strike a blow at British powor in Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf *13,      The above air submitted as political reasons in favour of the retention of Cyprus by Groat Britain. There seem, on the other hand, no solid reasons whatever for giving the island to Greece,The population of Cyprus consists of about 243,000 Orthodox Christians who speak a corrupt dialect of modem Greek but arc by no means of pure Greek descent; and of some 61,000 Turks, who are loyal to Great Britain and bitterly hostile to the idea of Greek rule,A noisy agitation in favour of union with Greece has been carried on for come years by the politicians who profess to represent the Greek-speaking element; but the agitation is,&quot;a3 3uch agitations tend to bo, entirely artificial.The politicians in Cyprus are lawyers and money-lenders almost to a men, and extort lip-service to their propaganda from the indebted Greeksspeaking peasantry only by means of financial pressure and intimidation.    The peasants have no desire to exchange their present impartial administration, security, and low taxation for the burdensome taxation, corrupt government, and conscription which would be their lot under Greece.    The Turks of Cyprus, who have consistently supported the British Administration ever since the Occupation in 1878, and who have on the whole behaved very creditably during tho war in what were undoubtedly trying circumstances, ask nothing more than to remain under British rule,Their previous record entitles them &quot;to consideration on our part, ma to a better fate than that of being placed under Greece, who ha3 been so far notoriously incapable of dealing fairly with her ;.io3lcm subjects..A3 Pan-Hellenic propagandists talk much of giving Cyprus back to Greece, it may be as well to recall that the only time when Cyprus can be considered to have been under Greek rule, was between 3$5 and 1184 A.D,, when it formed a part of the Byzantine Empire,    During this period it is noteworthy that the Cypriotes were almost constantly in revolt against their Greek rulers,I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed) J.X do Robeck.VI ce-Admiral, Comma nd o r-i n-Chi ef..
