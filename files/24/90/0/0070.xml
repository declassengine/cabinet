Mi^ CAB/A/^v11&apos;&apos;-&apos;&quot;SUPPLY 0? MILITARY MATERIAL AMD STORESVI OTTO ESTHONIA.i ft1/Memorandum for the War Cah5.net by the First Lord of the Admiralty.I invite the attention of the War Cabinet to the     \ decision conveyed in War Cabinet Memo. 634, regarding the discontinuance of the supply of military material and suorss to the Baltic States.   That decision was that while the British Government are net prepared to give to the Baltic States supplies for the purpose cf aggressive operations against the Bolshevists, they would, nevertheless, in the event cf an attack by the Bolshevist Government on the freedom and liberties of the States, be prepared to reconsider the situation,.In the telegram addressed by the Foreign Office to H.M. Representatives on the 25th September (Appendix III to W,,C.624), it was stated more explicitly as follows :-&quot;Neither is this decision (viz?.s the stoppage of military supplies) intended to imply any abandonment cf the States in the event of their boundaries being crossed and their existence imperilled by an invasion cf Bolshevik Forces.   In such case, where the national liberties of these States would be at stake, H.M, Government might be prepared to make the sacrifices .......... and to reconsider their decision as tothe supply cf war material.*The ta3k of the British Naval Forces in the Gulf of Finland is to prevent the violation of the coasts of the Baltic States; Bsthonian men-of-war are at present sharing in this taSk under the command of the British Senior Officer; and if further supplies of fuel and ammunition are withheld this co-operation must come to an end and the onus of defence of these States fall solely on H.M, Navy.It is therefore submitted for decision whether this i3 not a case where &quot;the National liberty cf esthonia is at stake&quot;, and the approval of the War Cabinet is requested to continue such supplies of fuel and ammunition as will enable the ships of the Esthonian Navy to continue their co-operation, with its consequent easing of patrol work on the part of the British ships, until H.H, ships are finally withdrawn from these waters.(Jntlld) W.H.L,18,10,19,
