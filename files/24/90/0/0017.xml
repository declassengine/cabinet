AFFAIRS OF MALTA.I.MEMORANDUMby theI wish to draw the attention of the Cabinet to the urgent necessity of dealing with the situation in Malta, if we are to avoid serious trouble there. That little island is one of the most important of our oversea possessions. The War has once more illustrated its value. Without our base at Malta the Mediterranean would have been almost untenable, and the maintenance of our armies at Salonica, at Gallipoli, and in Palestine would have been rendered much more difficult. The probable course of developments in the Near East will only increase the importance of Malta. But the condition of the island, economically and politically, is so unsound as gravely to impair its strategic value.In June last anti-British agitation of long standing, which had steadily gathered strength owing to the increasing poverty of the people, culminated in serious riots. For two days the principal town in. the island was at the mercy of a mob, which broke into and set fire to houses, beat and otherwise maltreated a number of innocent people, and did thousands of pounds worth of damage. The police failed completely. Military assistance had to be called in, and before order could be restored several civilians were shot dead and a number more seriously wounded.   Owing to the fact that public interest in this country was just then absorbed by the Peace Conference and industrial unrest at home, this disgraceful incident attracted a great deal less attention than it otherwise might have done.   And this was fortunate, for, if the matter had been debated in Parliament, the Government would have been exposed to severe and just criticism for tolerating a state of things which naturally led to such disorders.  Having escaped in this instance, we should indeed be tempting Providence if we allowed the island to continue in a condition which will almost certainly produce fresh outbreaks, perhaps on a more serious scale.The reports which I received from the new Governor, Field-Marshal Lord Plumer, who arrived in Malta a few days after the riots, were so disquieting, both in regard to the state of unrest in the island and the condition of its finances, that in August last I thought it desirable to send someone from the Colonial Office to investigate matters on the spot and to confer with the Governor as to the best means of improving the situation. The Under-Secretary of State (Colonel Amery) kindly gave up his holiday in order to visit the island, and has brought back a full report which, together with a despatch from the Governor proposing certain constitutional changes, I have attached to this memorandum. Having carefully considered the information and suggestions contained in these documents, I now solicit the approval of the Cabinet to the following proposals, which seek to combine a reform of the constitution of Malta with measures calculated to relieve her economic distress.A. Economic.The financial position of the island is so bad that some assistance is urgently necessary. Measures of relief simply cannot be avoided. The only question is what form they should take.It will be seen from Colonel Amery&apos;s report and the financial statement annexed to it (Appendix A) that, even with the imposition of additional taxation amounting to about  70,000 a year-the necessity for which in view of the extreme poverty of the people is greatly to be regretted-the deficit for the present financial year (i.e., to March 31st, 1920) is estimated at  187,000, and for the next financial year
(to March 31st, 1921) at  105,000. This is assuming that the bread subsidy, which had to be granted last March in order to keep the price of bread from rising above 4^d. a rotolo, or 10^d. for 4 lbs., is maintained for the whole of the present and the first half of the next financial year. Were it not for this subsidy, which in view of the fact that the working population of Malta was actually starving they had exhausted their savings and were living largely on food &quot; refuse &quot; thrown away by the hospitals (see para, 5 of Col. Amery&apos;s Report) had become absolutely necessary, there would, with the additional taxation, be no deficit. It is of course possible, though not likely, that a fall in the price of bread before next year&apos;s harvest will allow of the abolition or of a reduction of the subsidy in the course of the next twelvemonth. But, barring this off chance, we have got to find about  300,000 for Malta between now and the end of the next financial year.This can, of course, be done by means of a loan from the Imperial Exchequer. But I am strongly of opinion that it would be neither politic nor wise to impose the burden of a debt upon Malta in the present case. The poverty of her people and the disordered state of her finances are the result of Imperial policy. The Imperial Government cannot indeed be blamed for the change in the disposition of our naval forces after 1902 which, by reducing our establishments in the Mediterranean, struck so heavy a blow at the prosperity of Malta. But we cer-tainly are to blame, in my opinion, for not recognising that the injury thus inflicted upon Malta entitled&quot; her to generous consideration from us in other respects. Instead of that, our treatment of her, in financial matters, so far from being generous, has not even been just. We have continued to use valuable property belonging to Malta other than land or buildings required for purposes of defence  without paying a fair economic rent for it. And at the same time our contribution to the cost of public works has fallen short of the amount necessary to compensate Malta for the extra burden thrown upon her by the fact that these works, especially as regards drainage and water supply, were more extensive and costly than was. necessary for purely local requirements. These financial grievances of Malta were pointed out by the Royal Commission of 1911, of which Sir F. Mowatt was the head, but nothing adequate has been done to remove them. Worst of all, perhaps, we have continued to pay disgracefully low wages to the Maltese not the British-workmen in the Dockyard, from which a large portion of the Maltese population derives, directly or indirectly, its only means of support. The present break-down of the public finance of Malta is the direct consequence of this unfair treatment. We should not be justified in imposing a fresh burden upon Malta to get her out of difficulties which we are ourselves responsible for creating. , Rather ought we frankly to acknowledge the position, and at one and the same time relieve Malta of her immediate embarrassments, and put her local finances on such a footing that such embarrassment may not recur.With this object in view I desire to make three proposals. The first is that, following up the suggestions of the Mowatt Commission, we should in future pay from Imperial funds the full economic rent of the land and houses occupied for Imperial purposes, and at the same time bring up the Imperial contribution for public works to a figure which would fairly represent the extra cost due to Imperial requirements. If this were done it is estimated that the revenue of the island would benefit to the extent of between  40,000 and  50,000 a year. Under normal circumstances, i.e., when the bread subsidy had come to an end, it would thus be once more possible to balance revenue and expenditure, even allowing for such additional provision as is necessary for education and other urgent public require-ments.But these measures, though safeguarding the position for the future,, would not provide for the deficits of the present and the coming financial year. My second proposal therefore is to wipe out these deficits by a grant from the Imperial Exchequer. The lowest figure at which I can put such a grant is  250,000. The deficits indeed, as I have shown, are likely to amount to more than that, viz., to something like  300,000. But if my first proposal is accepted, the revenue of the island will be increased in the coming financial year by between  40,000 and  50,000; therefore a grant of  250,000 ought to suffice to re-establish financial equilibrium by the end of that year March 1921. My third and last proposal on the economic side is that the Imperial authorities should in future pay a living wage to the Maltese workmen in the Dockyard.   This would go a long way towards.(25273-2) Wt. 21187-G 469 250 10/19 H. St. G. 1 A 2
enabling the poorest class of the Maltese population to bear the burden of taxation, which will still be heavy in proportion to their resources, and would render such exceptional and undesirable expedients as the bread subsidy unnecessary in future.It is quite true that, even if all these measures are adopted, a great deal more will be required, in the way of developing the resources of the island and encouraging new industries, before Malta can recover her old prosperity. But we shall at least have removed what are, and are felt to be, crying grievances, which account for a great deal of the present unpopularity of British rule, and we shall have made it possible for the Maltese authorities to adopt a more liberal and progressive economic policy. The rest must be left to time and to&apos; the exertions of the Maltese themselves. They are an intelligent and industrious people, at present weighed down by economic misfortunes, for which they are themselves not to blame, and it is reasonable to hope that, given a fair chance, they will gradually work out their own salvation.B. Political.The political discontent, which has now assumed such formidable proportions, has without a doubt been greatly aggravated by the material grievances to which I have referred. But it is not wholly due to economic causes. As is pointed out in Colonel Amery&apos;s Report, an agitation for a greater measure of self-government has been carried on in Malta for many years-long before the beginning of the economic crisis, which has, however, contributed greatly to the violence of that agitation and to the.amount of popular support which it has latterly received. During the last 30 years the Constitution of Malta has undergone several changes, first in the direc-tion of what is technically known as &quot; Representative Government &quot;; then, when this system after a long time had proved unworkable, there was a return to the more autocratic regime at present in force. That regime, however, is intensely and increasingly unpopular, and there seems no hope that as long as it is maintained, we shall see the end of political unrest in Malta, or that the educated members of the Maltese. community will desist from the barren and embittered agitation against British rule and devote themselves in a practical way to the better management of local affairs.I agree with Lord Plumer and Colonel Amery in thinking that the time lias come when we should at least try the experiment of giving them that full measure of self-government which they have so insistently demanded, It is true that Malta can never have complete &quot; Responsible Government&quot; as it exists in the Dominions. The Imperial authority must always, retain the full and unfettered control of the military and naval establishments, the fortifications, the dockyard, &amp;c, and all the administrative and legislative powers which, are necessary to make that control effective. But there is no reason why a clear line of demarcation should not be drawn between Imperial and local interests and services. With regard to the former the Governor would remain, as he now is, absolute; with regard to the latter he would, like the Governor of a Dominion, act on the advice of Ministers who enjoyed the confidence of the local Parliament. Provision would, of course, have to be made for deciding questions which might occasionally arise as to the limits of the several spheres of the Imperial and the local authorities. I think the constitu-tion should provide that m such cases the decision should rest with the Governor, subject to an appeal to the Secretary of State. In view of the paramount character of Imperial interests in Malta, which everybody recognises, I do not think that even Maltese reformers would object to such a provision.But while advocating the ultimate introduction of complete &quot; Responsible Government &quot; with regard to local affairs, Lord Plumer and Colonel Amery both suggest that for a very brief period-2 or 3 years certain local services should be &quot; reserved &quot; and continue, as the Imperial services will always continue, to be controlled directly by the Governor. We should then have for a brief period the transitional system which, in connection with Indian constitutional reforms, has come to be known as &quot; diarchy.&quot; The reason for this suggestion is that some of these services, notably the police, require thorough overhauling, and that it would not be giving the new local Government a fair chance i f it had to take over a machine that was in bad working order. With this I agree, but it does not seem to me necessary, on that account, to introduce so complicated a system as that oi a temporary division of the local services into two categories of &quot;transferred&quot; and &quot; reserved.&quot;  And it seems all the more desirable to avoid this additional
1 ^1u&apos;2527s&apos; -&apos;&apos; a3complication because we are in any case bound to have a permanent line of demarcation-tion between Imperial and local services. The plan which I think the best is that, when we have decided what services can be handed over, as being &quot; local,&quot; to the control of Ministers deriving their authority from the Maltese legislature, these services should be handed over &quot; en bloc &quot; and that the new Constitution should be set up in its entirety at one date and not by instalments. There will be plenty of time, as it seems to me, to carry out the necessary reconstruction of the police and any other service which needs to be put on a better footing, before the transfer is effected. Tor even if we decide at once, as I hope we shall do, to give &quot; Responsible Government&quot; to the Maltese in respect of their local affairs, the new Constitution embodying that principle will take some months to elaborate. After that the constituencies will have to be created, electoral lists prepared, and a reasonable interval allowed before the actual election. With one thing and another the new legislative assembly can hardly be convened before the beginning of 1921, and the interval between now and then seems to me to provide ample opportunity for any reforms of the administrative machine which it may be desirable to effect before the new Constitution comes into force.Into the details of that Constitution, which are discussed at some length in Colonel Amery&apos;s Report and the despatch of Lord Plumer, it does not seem necessary for me to enter at the present time. They must be carefully worked out by the Colonial Office (which has had a long experience in the shaping and reshaping ol various forms of Colonial government), in consultation with the Governor, who in his turn will continue to take counsel with the representatives of Maltese opinion. Indeed I should not have brought this matter before the Cabinet at all, if Malta were an ordinary Crown Colony. But in view of the special importance of that island, affecting as it does military and naval interests and involving considerations of foreign policy, I feel that any proposed change in its Constitution is a matter of Imperial interest, which calls for consideration by the Government as a whole. Before, therefore, taking any further steps in the matter I am anxious to obtain general authority from the Cabinet to proceed on the lines which I have indicated.In conclusion I should like to call attention to a point on which both Lord Plumer and Colonel Amery lay great stress. This is the desirability of putting the Maltese on the same footing as citizens of the United Kingdom or, it might be more accurate to say, as the inhabitants of the Channel Islands, who, like the Maltese, are European British subjects, though enjoying a government of their own in respect of their eligibility for the Imperial services. I agree that both from the point of view of making the fullest use of the man-power of the Empire, and from that of fostering a military and Imperial spirit among the Maltese, such a policy is a sound one. Lord Plumer has put forward proposals both for the recruitment of Maltese into the permanent service of the Royal Navy and for the raising of permanent Maltese units of the Regular Army. These are matters for the consideration of the Admiralty and the War Office, and I do not include them in the programme for which I am asking the sanction of the Cabinet. But I venture to express the hope that the Departments concerned will be able to see their way to accede to Lord Plumer&apos;s requests.MILNER,8th October, 1919.
THE  FINANCIAL AND  ECONOMIC  SITUATION.1. For more than ten years past the economic and financial situation of Malta has given cause for anxiety. -The position had become so serious by 1911 that a Royal Commission, consisting of Sir Francis Mowatt, Mr. Russell Rea, and Sir Mackenzie Chalmers, -was sent out in the autumn of that year. In their Report, issued in May, 1912, the Commissioners attributed the decline in the prosperity of the Island, partly to the diversion of ordinary merchant shipping traffic from Malta to Algiers, Tunis, Alexandria and Port Said, but mainly to changes in Imperial Naval and Military policy. Since 1902 the Imperial Garrison had been reduced to an extent which involved a loss of not less than  400,000 a year to the industries of Malta, while employment in the Dockyard and other Naval Establishments next to agriculture the main industry of the Island, supporting directly, not far off a quarter of the total population, and, indirectly, a much larger number was reduced from 9,175 men in 1905, to 5,181 in 1911. The Commissioners rightly described this as &quot; the blotting out of a large measure of the employment of the population,&quot; and as a &quot; calamity which the people of Malta could not foresee and against which they could not make provision.&quot; Without making definite recommendations in this immediate connexion they felt bound to express their conviction that it was impos-sible for the Imperial Government &quot; to look with indifference upon the condition of the large number of men thrown out of their employment by so large and rapid a change of Imperial policy and expenditure.&quot;2. With regard to the financial difficulties in which the Civil Government of Malta was involved as a consequence of the general depression, the Commissioners made a variety of detailed suggestions, some of which were subsequently carried out. But they drew particular attention to two points. One was that the Army and Navy occupied without payment of rent to the Civil Government, not only land or buildings required for purposes of defence, but also a large area of land and many of the finest buildings in the Island which were used for offices, quarters and kindred purposes. The other was that military and naval considerations had given rise to a system of public works, more particularly as regards water supply and drainage, on a scale far more extensive and costly than would have been justified if the Govern-ment had been administered solely in the interests of the Maltese, and that the contribution paid in this respect by the Imperial Government should be increased. Except, however, for the remission of a sum of  5,000 a year which Malta had up till then contributed for Military purposes, nothing has so far been done to remedy the obvious unfairness of the situation.   .3. The War, at first, brought some revival of prosperity. Large numbers of Maltese emigrants, it is true, flocked back from Tunis, Algeria and elsewhere. But these were easily absorbed in the general increase of employment consequent on increased naval, military and shipping activity of all kinds, or offered by service in the Malta Militia, or in the various Labour Corps which served in the Island or elsewhere. In the Dockyards, in particular, the number employed rapidly rose to nearly 16,000, and still stands at about 10,000. But with the War came the increased cost of living. A careful analysis of the position in this respect recently made for the local Government by Mr. H. Casolani shows an increase over the pre-war cost of living of 170 per cent., and estimates the absolute minimum on which a working man in Malta can support in health a family of five and the average in Malta is believed to be nearer seven than five at 355. a week. This is on the present subsidized bread price of k\d. a rotolo, or lOJd. for 4 lb. But the subsidy was only introduced in March last, and for the preceding two years the price of bread stood at 5\d. and even for a time at id. a rotolo, or Is. id. for 4 lb.  It is not difficult to imagine what thisREPORTbyLIEUTENANT-COLONEL L. S. AMERY, mp.
must have meant to a working population drawing wages on an average well below. 20s. a week, and accustomed, perforce, to live almost exclusively on bread.4. In England, and in most other countries affected by the War, the working classes have insisted on securing an increase in wages which has not only compen-sated for the increased cost of living, but in most cases has gone well beyond it. Their own effective organization, and the almost unlimited demand for labour in every direction, made this a comparatively easy matter. In Malta the workmen were unorganized, too poor to be capable of sustaining a prolonged strike, and entirely at the mercy of a single employer, the Imperial Government. Their only chance of securing a reasonable revision of their wages was that the local Civil Government, in the interests of the community for which it was responsible, and of its own revenue which depended on the prosperity of that community, should have used its influence with the Imperial Government on their behalf. Unfor-unfortunately the Civil Government tended to look at the matter more from the point of view of its own immediate financial difficulties than from the broader point of view of the economic welfare of the Island, and in June, 1917, when the situation first became really acute and the workmen had actually struck for a week, intimated to the Admiralty that to concede the increases asked for would inevitably involve the Civil Government in demands for similar increases from their own underpaid Civil Service. The best excuse that can be made for the Government of Malta is that its previous suggestions for the improvement of the pay of the local Civil Service had not met with a very encouraging reception from the Colonial Office in view of the state of the finances of the Island.5. Some increases, it is true, were supported by the Civil Government and conceded, and in the end a war bonus of 50 per cent., with a minimum of 10s. a week and a maximum of 155., was given to all the Dockyard employees. But with the normal standard wage of 14s. a week for labourers, rising in comparatively few instances above 26s&apos;. for skilled workmen, the bonus was, &quot;and is, inadequate to bring wages up to subsistence level. According to Mr. Casolani the situation was eked out, firstly, by the using up of all accumulated savings and the selling of personal and household effects, and, secondly, by the large quantities of food &quot; refuse,&quot; cast off clothing, &amp;c, thrown away by the hospitals and taken home by the Maltese employees. With the cessation of active hostilities hospitals closed down, the Dockyard establishments began to decrease again, overtime which, alone had enabled many workmen to subsist came to an end. Even the introduction in March last of the bread subsidy was not enough to alleviate the situation. The half starved populace, entirely ignorant of the general industrial and economic situation in the world outside, instead of concentrating on the real cause of their distress, namely the inadequacy of their wages, found a more obvious explanation in profiteering by the millers and by the Imperial Wheat Commission. As a matter of fact the millers&apos; profits were controlled, and the Wheat Commission delivered wheat to the local Government at cost price. But the irresponsible critics of the Government in the press and on the platform were either unaware of these facts, or too much concerned to discredit the administration to draw attention to them, and the present system of Government does not lend itself to effective propaganda on behalf of the constituted authorities. The inevitable result followed in the riots of last June. These were, I am convinced, essentially economic in their origin the incoherent, unreasoning protest of a hungry populace against its sufferings. It was only incidentally that this protest became associated with the long-standing agita-tion against the present constitutional regime and thus acquired a political and even an anti-English complexion.6. I understand that proposals for increased rates of pay for the JVJaltese workmen at the Dockyard were submitted to the Admiralty by the Admiral Superin-tendent as far back as last February. These have been strongly endorsed by the Governor in his despatch to the Secretary of State for the Colonies of the 16th of August. I can only express the earnest hope that these proposals will be accepted without further delay both in so far as they bear on the actual rates of pay of the Maltese workmen, and in so far as they deal with the unfair discrimination which they consider is exercised against them in various respects as compared with British workmen employed in the Dockyard. The latter at present receive wages, on an average, twice as high as the Maltese for the same class of work, over and above Foreign Service and Home Allowances, amounting to 22s. a week.  Apart from
these allowances, which are only fair to British workmen who have to maintain dependents at home, there is absolutely no reason, as Field-Marshal Lord Plumer rightly urges, for any differentiation between Maltese and British workmen other than the practical reason of difference in the quality of the work done. It is wholly inconsistent both with the general position of trusteeship which we adopt towards our dependencies, and with our special Imperial interest in the well being and loyalty of the population of so vital a centre of Imperial defence, that the Imperial Government should utilize its position of monopoly as the only large employer of labour in the Island, in order to keep down wages below subsistence level, or to discriminate against its Maltese employees on racial lines.7. The financial position of the Government of Malta has, meanwhile, gone from bad to worse. The reductions in salaries and other economics which were intro-duced-with very doubtful effect upon the efficiency of the civil service as a result of the recommendations of the Mowatt Commission, were more than absorbed in the small war bonuses which were all that the Government dared to give in view of-its financial difficulties, and of the popular outcry against the &quot;extravagance of the bureaucracy.&quot; Still, the additional taxation imposed in the last two years might have enabled the Government to pay its way but for the bread subsidy. That subsidy is a measure which in the present economic situation of the bulk of the working population of Malta is absolutely essential, and cannot be dispensed with as long as the natural price of bread remains above the present artificial price of 4^d. arotolo, or 10\d. for 4 lbs. According to the estimate of Mr. Huber, the Colonial Treasurer, the amount required for this purpose will be  193,000 for the current year, and a further  146,000 for the first six months of 1920-21 if bread prices do not fall in the interval. Taking into account a further sum of  60,000 which the Government will have to find in order to provide compensation for damages done in the riots, and spreading this over two years, the Treasurers figures imply a probable deficit of  216,500 for the current year, and of  175,000 for 1920-21,&apos; or a total prospective deficit of  391,000. This is on the basis of the present taxation, which is now estimated to bring in  569,000 for the current financial year, to which must be added amounts in hand of some  43,000.8. It is out of the question to suppose that the whole or even any large part of this deficit can be cleared off by additional taxation. In a forecast of the financial situation up to March, 1921, prepared for me by the Treasurer (Appendix A) were included, at my suggestion, a variety of additional duties calculated to yield a further  29,000 for this year, reducing the year&apos;s deficit to  187,500, and  69,000 for next year, reducing the prospective deficit for that year to  105,000, or  292,500 in all. An income tax might yield a further  15,000- 20,000 in 1920-21, thus reducing the total deficit over the two years to about  275,000. But in considering the possibility of these or any other additional taxes it is necessary to keep certain points in mind. &apos; In the first place the taxes, though low compared with our standards, fall mainly on a working class, living at or below subsistence level, and on a small peasantry whose holdings average not more than four acres apiece. A revision of the system of taxation calculated to lay more of the burden on the wealthier classes, however desirable in principle, could only yield a limited amount in view of the relatively small portion they form of the total population. Secondly, in the present state of public opinion in Malta, no additional taxation is possible unless some settlement can be found of the constitutional deadlock in a form which will satisfy the moderate section of the community. Thirdly, any additional taxes that can be raised, with the consent of the people, will be required to meet the urgent need for necessary additional expenditure.9. I have been convinced by the discussions which I have had with the Governor and the Lieutenant-Governor and with other responsible judges of the situation that, so far from retrenchment being possible in Malta, additional expendi-ture is essential to secure any real efficiency in the Government and to create any prospect of improvement in the general economic situation. One of the severest handicaps from which the Maltese suffer both in their own country and when they endeavour to emigrate, is the deplorable lack of educational facilities. There is barely sufficient school accommodation for half the children, and in the absence of compulsion those who do attend school are usually withdrawn between the ages of 8 and 10 and forget anything they may have learnt.   Not more than 15 per cent.
25273* Not printed.in fact of the population can read and write. The great majority of the school-masters and mistresses are unqualified, which is not surprising considering that their salaries are below the ordinary wages of local unskilled labour. More accom-modation, provision for playing grounds (at present non-existent) and physical training, and for technical and industrial training, better salaries for teachers, all these are essential preliminaries before compulsory education can be even usefully discussed. The hospital, lunatic asylum and other institutions, which, in the absence of any municipal system, have to be provided.out of general taxation, all require further expenditure. The lamentable failure of the Police on the occasion of the riots is only one of the examples of the uselessness of relying on starvation wages to secure efficiency in any branch of the public service. The creation of a Depart-ment of Agriculture to improve methods of cultivation and ascertain the possibility of more paying crops than those grown by ancient custom is a long neglected and urgent need to which prominent importance was assigned by the Mowatt Commission.10. The deficit can consequently only be met by extraordinary means. It is possible, in theory at least, that the local Government should find the money either by way of a loan or by the sale of lands and other public assets. Such a course would hamper the future financial position, already none too easy, by a burden of debt charge or the loss of revenue. And there is no moral justification for laying this obligation on the Colony. After all, the present position is mainly due to the bread subsidy which, in a very large measure, is nothing more nor less than a subvention in aid of the inadequate wages paid by the Imperial Government to its Maltese workmen. It is impossible for the Imperial Government to disclaim its responsibility in the matter.11. The case for Imperial assistance is strong enough on general grounds. But the case is even stronger when it is remembered that the Imperial Government has done nothing to meet the legitimate claims of Malta to rent for the land and buildings occupied by the Naval and Military Authorities apart from actual fortifi-cations, barracks and stores and to a revision of the proportion of expenditure contributed towards the drainage scheme. It is true that the Mowatt Commission suggested the remission of the  5,000 a year contribution for Military purposes as an alternative to the payment of the rents, and that this remission was in fact made. But this treatment of the two recommendations as alternative can only be accounted for on the supposition that the Commission did not enquire closely into the rental value of the occupied premises. A careful and conservative estimate of the rental value of the lands and buildings referred to in Appendix A to the report of the Commission, prepared for me by Mr. L. Gatt, the Superintendent of Public Works, gives the figure of  45,000 a year as the sum reasonably owing to the local Govern-ment of Malta by the Military and Naval Authorities (Appendix B).* From the point of view of the Authorities in question, the matter has no doubt always been treated as a small departmental point on which they have seen no special reason to give way to the Colonial Office. But from the point of view of Malta, the question is one which naturally looms very large both in its actual financial importance and as a matter of principle.12. It seems to me impossible, especially if it is desired to find a satisfactory settlement of the Constitutional difficulty, for the Imperial Government to continue to disregard the claims of Malta as put forward by the Mowatt Commission. And in view of the circumstances of the War and of the moral responsibility of the Imperial Government for the present economic position of Malta, I would suggest that the fairest and most satisfactory way of meeting that responsibility would be for the Imperial Government to recognise its obligation to meet those claims as from the date of the Commissioners&apos; Report. In other words, I suggest that the Imperial Government should repay to the Government of Malta rents on the premises in question as from the beginning of the fiscal year 1913-14, and should similarly nay, as from the same date, the extra contribution in respect of the drainage scheme. The amount due in this latter respect [see Appendix C) would be about  13,000 all told, and about  1,000 a year in the future. The above total includes a claim for increased cost of maintenance under the existing contribution, due mainly to the increase in the price of coal, amounting in all to  3,900 for the last three years.
This the Imperial Authorities concerned have hitherto refused to consider, in spite of the fact that it would appear, from a memorandum on the coal situation during the War which was prepared for me by the Lieutenant-Governor (Appendix D) that the Admiralty made a profit of over  50,000 on coal supplied to the Civil Government of Malta during the War. The actual assessment of these various claims, including the rents, might be left to a joint Commission, under an. impartial Chairman, which could also make definite arrangements for the future.. But an advance on account would have to be made by the Treasury, of, up to, say,  200.000 to meet the immediate deficiency.13. Such a settlement would, in all reasonable probability, tide the Island through the present financial crisis, even if the price of bread continued high throughout a considerable part of 1920. More important still it would satisfy the Maltese that they had been fairly treated in respect of a long-standing grievance, and would encourage them to make a determined effort to cope with their own economic and financial problems more effectively in the future.14. Increases of taxation will be required in any case in the near future, and it may be necessary to impose immediately some or all of the additional Customs duties indicated in the Treasurers suggested Budget (Appendix A, Table D).* But, in the main, this is a matter which, I am convinced, must be settled by the Maltese for themselves, and I do not therefore propose to examine in detail the many sug-suggestions as to income tax, house tax, and other means of raising revenue which have been put before me. There is a good deal to be said for the suggestion that Govern-ment property, instead of being leased on short terms, with obligation on the Government to repair, should be let on long or perpetual leases, the Government thus securing considerable sums by way of premium and saving an enormous amount of clerical and supervising work. I understand that a Committee is inquiring into this question. It would also, I think, be sounder both from the point of view of finance and of practical execution if, in future, public works of a permanent character were provided from loans and not out of current revenue. I see no reason why small loans for such purpose should not be successfully raised in Malta itself.15. The reduction of the grain and flour tax, which yields some  90,000, was advocated by the Mowatt Commission, but not carried out. For the time being the tax has no fiscal value, as it is, in fact, given back again in the bread subsidy, and the question of its reduction could only acquire practical importance when the normal price falls below the present standard price. Its retention has been urged as a matter of protection to local agriculture. But such protection is likely to be secured for some time to come by high world prices, and, in any case, there are probably other more intensive and profitable forms of cultivation which it would pay to encourage in the place of cereals. On the other hand, it is urged that the benefit of the reduction might be almost wholly intercepted by the millers and other middlemen. To avoid this it has been suggested that the Government should extend the present control to a monopoly of the import, and possibly also of the milling, of grain. By.this means the Government could fix prices at a moderate and steady level, make a reasonable profit, and at the same time ensure the certainty of an adequate reserve of breadstuffs for a possible siege. Similar monopolies of coal and fuel have also been suggested.16. More important in the long run than the immediately urgent problem of finance is the problem of finding new sources of employment and income for the population of the Island. It is possible that quite an appreciable field for development for Maltese agriculture may have been made available by the new British preference on tobacco, wine, liqueurs and perfumery. But in the absence of a proper Agricultural Department, no one in Malta seems to have any idea how much of the soil is suitable for growing tobacco, or for producing a wine good enough for export. There are considerable prospects, both from the point of view of local consumption and of export, for a fishing industry on modern lines, and thanks to Lord Plumer&apos;s initiative, a syndicate has already been formed to exploit the possibilities in this direction. Even more valuable from the point of view of employment in the Island would be the creation of a civil shipbuilding industry. Though all the essential raw materials would have to be imported, there is the advantage of good and relatively cheap labour,, and the position of Malta wouldNot printed.
be very favourable as a headquarters for the coasting trade of the Eastern Mediter-ranean. In a smaller way a good deal might be done by the resuscitation or improve-ment of old established industries such as lacemaking, glove making, brass and. silver work.17. One source of revenue and employment to which the Mowatt Commission drew special attention were the possibilities of Malta as a resort for tourists and winter residents. In climate, natural beauty; historical and archaeological interest Malta offers great attractions which have not generally been appreciated, quite apart from the social attractions and the sports associated with the presence of a. Naval and Military headquarters. The starting of one or two really first rate modern hotels might be the beginning of a movement which might have an incal-culable effect on the economic life of the Colony. But here, as in all other new enterprises, the capital and initiative will, in the first instance at least, have to come from England.18. But whatever measures may be taken to increase the opportunities for profitable employment in Malta itself, the population will continue to outgrow the possible resources of the Island. The only remedy for this state of affairs is well directed emigration. Maltese have done well not only in Egypt, Tunis and Algiers, but also in the Dominions. They make excellent settlers, more particularly where the way is already paved for them by their fellow countrymen, and their power of standing a hot climate should make them peculiarly acceptable in the northern part of Australia and in East and South Africa. Unfortunately, they have been seriously handicapped in the past by an imperfect knowledge of English and a general lack of education and technical,training, and a comparatively low standard of living. These objections have, possibly, been somewhat exaggerated, and are, at any rate, not insurmountable. There can be no doubt that, as improvement is made in these respects, and as more Maltese settle in the Dominions, their good qualities will be increasingly appreciated. There is a good prospect, meanwhile, of a considerable number finding employment in France in connexion with the rebuilding of the devastated areas.THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROBLEM.19. One clear conviction has been borne in upon me by actual contact with the situation in Malta. That is the impossibility of dealing with the financial and economic situation, unless the-political situation is dealt with at the same time. A fresh start in politics is -an essential condition for a fresh start in the economic field. Given such a fresh start in both fields there is every reason to hope that Malta may become an increasingly important element in the strength of the British Commonwealth, not only in virtue of its geographical position, but even more as a centre of British sentiment and influence throughout the Mediterranean. If no fresh start is made, or if it is made on wrong lines, there is a grave risk of Malta becoming a source of weakness and disaffection both locally and in every region to which Maltese may emigrate. We have enough with one Ireland, without creating another, even if on a small scale, at one of the most vital points of our chain of Imperial communications.20. The history of the constitutional question in Malta is anything but a satisfactory one. The demand for some considerable measure of self-government has been made at intervals ever since the British occupation. After some twenty years of agitation a new Constitution was granted by Letters Patent in December, 1887. A Council of Government was constituted composed of six Official and fourteen Elected Members four of these latter being representatives of certain special interests chosen by electors with a special property qualification. Money votes were to be decided by the Elected Members only, but could only be introduced by, or with the express sanction of, the Governor. Not less than three Elected Members, nominated by the Governor, were to sit on the Executive Council. The scheme was, as Crown Colony Constitutions go, of a very liberal character. But it suffered from the inherent defects of any Constitution in which legislative and executive control are divided, and in which the Elected Members enjoy unlimited power of paralysing the machinery of Government as a whole, without having real responsibility for a single department.21. Almost from the very outset the Elected Members, in their eagerness to convert the new Constitution into a system of complete self-government, raised25273 a 6
the issue of high constitutional principle at every, opportunity, to the entire dis-regard of the practical necessities of administration. The Government,on its side, responsible for the effective control of affairs, and still profoundly imbued with the old Crown Colony principles, pushed through business as best it could by the exercise.of its reserve powers, in theTast resort by Orders in Council. From 1898 onwards the constitutional battle raged mainly over the question of the use of the Italian language, which for the time being became the banner of Maltese opposition to Colonial Office control. In 1903 the Elected Members rejected the Education Estimates on account of the refusal of the Government to abolish the free choice by the parents of the language in the schools. Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s patience at last gave out. New Letters Patent were issued reducing the number of Elected Members in the Council of Government to eight as against ten Official Members. The conduct of the Elected Members had been irresponsible throughout, often childish. But the system was not one calculated to encourage a sense of responsibility.22. Since 1903 the Elected Members have devoted their energies almost exclusively to protesting against the present form of Government. For the most part they have refrained from taking part in the work of the legislation or admini-stration, and have abstained from attendance at the Council of Government. More recently they have attended the Council once in two months to register their protest. Outside the Council they have devoted themselves on the platform and in the Press to a continuous agitation, in which every measure of the Government has been arraigned in terms of unmeasured violence. It is to this agitation that the recent riots owed their political and anti-English complexion. But the actual riots seriously alarmed most of the political agitators, who had no idea that things would go so far, and have since adopted a more moderate attitude. Subsequently, in response to an intimation from Lord Plumer that he would like to have a reasoned statement of the constitutional changes which the Maltese desired, a &quot; Consiglio Popolare &quot; or National Assembly met, under the presidency of a former Elected Member, Dr. F. Sceberras, and in August submitted a draft Constitution. The draft, which has been worked out with some care (Appendix E),, provides for com-plete responsible self-government as regards local affairs. The question of what are Imperial affairs or interests is, in case of disagreement between the Governor and his Cabinet, left to the discretion of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. The Executive is to consist of a Civil Governor and a Cabinet of seven Ministers. The Legislature is to be composed of two houses : a Senate of 12, elected by all electors who can read or write, from among higher ecclesiastics, graduates, professional men, members of the Chamber of Commerce, ex-Members of the Chamber of Deputies and persons enjoying unearned income of over  100 a year, or paying  50 in rent; and a Chamber of Deputies of 22 members, elected by all electors who have reached the age of 21 and can read and write, or pay a rent or enjoy an unearned income of not less than  5 a year.23. During the earlier years of the political agitation, it may safely be said that the question of the Constitution only interested a very small fraction of the population. Even in 1903 it is not improbable that the bulk of the citizens of Malta were quite satisfied that Mr. Chamberlain had put an end to the tiresome activities of the elected members. But the events of the last few years, more particularly the acute economic depression, have altered all that. There is now undoubtedly an almost universal opinion that the present system cannot go on and that some far-reaching change must be adopted. The Government of Malta to-day inspires no confidence either in the public or in its own members. There might be something to be said for an autocratic Government run entirely by keen, active English officials in every Department, reforming the Maltese in spite of themselves, and raising such taxes as seemed good to it. But the present administration, with the exception of the Governor and the Lieutenant-Governor, is. almost entirely in the hands of the Maltese. Without any disparagement of a body of efficient and honourable public servants, it is necessary to admit that, collectively, they have neither the confidence of their fellow-citizens nor the political courage which can capture confidence, or at any rate, achieve big results. They have neither the means nor the temperament to cope with the reckless and irresponsible criticism to which they are subjected, and are naturally reluctant to venture on any measure which may provoke a fresh outcry. Bureaucratic Government under- such conditions inevitably tends to be timid and furtive, and the most able and vigorous Governor can do little to infuse permanent life into the machine.
24. The present system cannot go on without serious risk of permanently estranging the Maltese people from British rule. A reversion to the system of 1887, or any other similar system which gives.no sufficiently definite responsibility either to the representatives of the Maltese people or to the agents of the Imperial Authority promises no better results now than in the past. The question has, therefore, to be fairly faced : are the Maltese people inherently unfit for the respon-sible self-government for which they ask ? Or, are the requirements of the Imperial Garrison in Malta such as to preclude all possibility of that self-government being granted in any case ?25. The assumption implied in the latter question is one which has long been prevalent, but for which I can find no real justification. There seems no real reason why local self-government in Malta should interfere with the security or freedom of action of the Imperial Naval, Military or Air Authorities, providing certain essential conditions are observed. The first is that there shall be an absolutely clear definition of the respective powers and functions of the Imperial and local Governments. Such a definition would undoubtedly retain for the Imperial Authority a variety of functions which, in a self-governing Dominion, are vested in the Dominion Government. These would naturally, in addition to the actual control of the Imperial Establishments in Malta, include such matters as the declaration of Martial Law and the framing of exceptional defence regulations in time of war, the control of aviation, territorial waters, merchant shipping, bunker-ing, cables and wireless, passport regulations, &amp;c. These or, preferably perhaps, the actual functions assigned to the Civil Government, would have to be definitely enumerated. Secondly, the Governor should have a clear right, subject to the final arbitrament of the Secretary of State, of deciding between the two authorities in doubtful cases. Thirdly, the two authorities already linked together in the person of the Governor, should be kept in closest possible touch on the Governors Executive Council, on joint boards for dealing with such, matters as drainage, water, lighting, and perhaps also fuel and wheat supply, which are equally of interest to both, and in every other possible way.26. Nor can I see any sufficient reason for assuming the inherent incapacity of the Maltese for responsible self-Government. The Maltese community is much larger than many other European communities in the Empire to which self-govern-ment has been entrusted in the last 60 years. It is not confronted by the difficulties arising from immensity of area such as those which confronted the community of Western Australia then less than one-fourth of the present population of Malta-when it was entrusted with the control of nearly half a continent. No question arises as to its fitness to govern a large subject native population such as arose when self-government was granted in the various South African Colonies. It is true the bulk of the people is illiterate and profoundly ignorant about politics. But that might have been said both about French Canada and about a large propor-tion of the Dutch electorate in South Africa. And the educated and leisured classes are quite numerous enough to furnish a reasonable sufficiency of capable men to take part in the work of Government, if only they are willing to come forward. ,The real difficulty lies in the complete absence of any trained sense of responsibility on the part of the electors, and in a highly developed irresponsibility which has been cultivated in those who have taken the most active interest in politics during the last thirty years of barren constitutional wrangling. For this - weakness there is only one cure: the actual exercise of responsibility both by the electors and by their representatives.27. But admitting the exercise of responsibility as the only real remedy, it is equally true that the experiment of throwing the whole responsibility for the legis-lation, administration and finance of the Island in. every department upon an utterly untrained body of representatives might, very possibly, lead to chaos and a general breakdown of government. Certain departments of the administration, as for instance the Police, are in urgent need of complete reorganization. Others, such as the proposed new department of Agriculture and Commerce, still have to be created. To throw the whole burden of finding a way out of the financial and administrative crisis brought about by the events of the last few years straightway upon the elected representatives&apos;would be unfair to them, and an unwarranted abnegation of responsibility on our own part. ;28. The most satisfactory solution of the problem the same problem in essence as that which we are endeavouring to solve in India-seems to lie in the grant of25273 . A 7
real arid complete responsible Government by instalments, in other words by the specific transfer of complete legislative and administrative control over certain U departments of Government, reserving the others in the unfettered control of the Imperial authority. In the case of India progress in this direction must necessarily be gradual and tentative. The circumstances of Malta and the character of its people make it desirable that progress should be rapid and its stages definitely fixed at the outset. There should be only one transitional stage, and that for riot longer than is absolutely necessary both to enable existing deficiencies in the administration to be made good, and to afford some training in responsibility to the elected representatives. Two, or at the most three, years should be sufficient for this purpose. And it should be announced from the outset that, subject to the successful working of the experiment in the transitional stage, complete responsible Government in local affairs, as defined, will be granted at the end of the two or three years, as the case may be. Such a definite announcement would. I believe, both be welcomed as a generous fulfilment of the wishes of the Maltese and be an encouragement to the political leaders of the community to concentrate on practical work during the short period of transition.29. The system of Government which would be established in Malta at the end of the two or three years would be substantially that which has been asked for by the National Assembly. . An elected legislature would have complete control over legislation and finance in regard to local affairs, and the executive heads of all the local departments would be members of the legislature and amenable to its control, These would be selected by the Governor on the advice of the leader of the majority in the popular assembly, and would form his Executive Council for local purposes. For purposes connected with the administration of the Imperial services the Governor would have a nominated Executive Council composed of representatives of those services. In order, however, to maintain touch between the Imperial and local services in Malta it is essential that these two Executive Gouncils should rather be treated as two elements of a single Executive Council and should normally sit together as such. But the Governor would reserve his freedom to consult with each separately, and, in any case, would be guided solely by the views of the elected members on matters within their responsibility.30. During the transitional period the system of government would be essen-tially the same in principle. It would still be responsible self-government in local affairs. The only difference would be that the range of subjects over which that responsible self-government was exercised would be narrower. The legislature would be the same from the start, but its competence would be strictly confined to the sphere of the transferred subjects. In the sphere of taxation, however, its powers should only be limited by such provision as may be necessary to secure the finance of the administration of the reserved subjects. These subjects should either have a first call on the general revenue or preferably, perhaps, upon the proceeds of such taxes as are sufficient to provide for their administration, including a reasonable margin for expansion, and the voting of those particular taxes, and of the reserved estimates would be outside the competence of the legislature. As regards-the Executive, there would be the same division between the elected Ministers responsible&apos; to the legislature for the conduct of their departments, and the nominated officials responsible only to the Governor. The latter would, however, during this period include, not only the representatives of the Imperial services, but also the official heads of the reserved local departments.31. The essential condition of smooth working during the transitional period is that the division between the transferred and reserved services should be clearly defined and recognised by all parties, and that the responsibility in each sphere should be complete in respect alike of legislation, administration and finance. It is necessary in the interests of mutual understanding and education that the different elements in the Executive Council should discuss matters together. But the Governor should never take the vote of the elected members on ariy matter within the sphere of the Imperial or of the reserved services; or vice versa. Similarly, it is &apos; desirable that all. members of the Executive Council should have the right of laying their views before, either Chamber of the Legislature. But only those who are f) elected members of the Chamber should have the right to vote. Legislation oil reserved subjects, as well as administration and finance, should be entirely settled by the Governor and the nominated members of the Executive Council for those
subjects, though it might usually be advantageous to discuss it, at some stage, with the whole of the Executive Council and with the legislature. The legislature should in fact, as regards the reserved services for the transitional period, and permanently as regards the Imperial services and interests in Malta, be purely a consultative body. It should have no legal competence in respect of those matters, any more than the legislature of a Canadian province has any competence in Dominion affairs.32. The question of the actual departments to be transferred or reserved is not altogether easy. The vost obvious departments to be transferred are those of Public Works and of Health and Charitable&apos; Institutions. These account between them for nearly half the normal budget, and have been among the most freely criticised for extravagance. The Lieutenant-Governor&apos;s Department, which includes the Police and the general maintenance of order, and the Crown Advocated Department, should obviously be reserved, and the same should probably apply to the new Department, yet to be created, of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce. Education is a difficult question. On the one hand there is much to be said in favour of a thoroughgoing attempt to reform and extend it before it is&apos; handed over, and for avoiding the risk of any legislation which would reintroduce the old language controversy. On the other hand there is always the danger of an outcry that advantage was being taken of the transitional period to anglicise education. The Treasury offers a somewhat different problem. It would clearly be difficult, if not impossible, for a nominated Treasurer to carry through his budget in the Assembly. A possible expedient would be, while retaining the Treasury as a reserved service, to leave it to the leader of the majority to frame his own budget (outside the taxes ear-marked for the reserved subjects) with the technical assistance and advice of the Treasurer and his staff, and to be responsible for carrying it in the Assembly. The alternative would be to entrust the entire responsibility for the administration as well as for the levying of finance to one of the elected members, subject only to the right of the reserved services to draw, on the Treasury up to the total of the ear marked revenues. Such a decision would certainly be welcomed as a sign of confidence and as a proof that real responsibility was being conferred, and might make it easier either to reserve education altogether or to secure a satisfactory agreement both as to the language question and as to the need for progressive reform before it is transferred.33. Enough has been said to indicate the main outlines, both of the ultimate system of complete responsible self-government for Malta in local affairs, and of the limited, but still responsible, self-government which would be in force during the period of transition. But it may be worth while devoting a little attention to some of the detailed features of the new constitution which will have&apos; to be set up. In this respect there is no reason why the main outlines of the draft of the National Assembly should not be followed as far as may be conveniently possible. As far as the Executive is concerned, the motive underlying the demand of the National Assembly for a Civil Governor will largely disappear with the clear definition between the Imperial and local aspect of his duties. On the other hand, there are practical administrative advantages in peace, and still more in war, in the con-oentration of the supreme military authority in the hands of the head of the Executive. In any case, the matter is one which can very well continue to be left in the discretion of the Imperial Authorities.34. The remainder of the Executive, according to the National Assembly&apos;s project, is to consist of seven. Ministers, who would be the political heads of the different departments. In the case of some of the departments, however, it might be preferable to place the department under a Board, of which the Minister would be Chairman. This would facilitate the closer association with the work of the department of other elected members or of outside experts, or representatives of special interests such as the Church. I have already suggested that similar boards, under the chairmanship of the Governor, should deal with matters of joint concern to the local and Imperial Governments.35. The decision of the National Assembly, after long discussions, to have two Chambers for the Legislature may reasonably be accepted, even if at first sight the scheme may appear somewhat ambitious for so small a community. The actual composition of the two Chambers might, however, be improved in certain respects. The suggested Legislative Assembly of 22 is undoubtedly too small. With a total of seven Ministers, four or five of whom are likely to be&quot;Members of the assembly.
it leaves the relative proportion of Ministers to their followers unduly high, More-over, the  real danger in Malta is not that inferior men might get into the Assembly-that, after all, matters very little if they have better men to lead them-but that the best men may be deterred from standing by the fear of the bitterness and personalities which have, in the past, formed so unsatisfactory a feature of public life in the Island. The larger the number of seats, the less intense, in the first instance at any rate, will be the competition, and the greater the chance of the Assembly comprising at the outset, and afterwards retaining, a reasonable selection of members of a good type, A larger number would also permit of the introduction of Proportional Representation. This would be most desirable as tending still further to diminish personal animosities and increase the chances of moderate men being returned and as conducing to political stability. I would therefore suggest . that the Assembly should contain not less than 30, and possibly as many as 40, members.36.   The general principle of a Senate chosen from the representatives of certain special classes is one at once familiar to the rather mediaeval traditions of Malta, and at the same time in keeping with the latest trend of political develop-ment.   The proposal, however, to elect these by scrutin de liste in two constituencies for the whole Colony would in reality eliminate that representation, and substitute a Chamber composed, in all probability, of strong partisans all belonging to the same party and only nominally coming within one or other of the special classes. As the electorate for this purpose would be different from the electorate for the Assembly, that party might possibly, and even probably, be of the opposite com-plexion to &quot;the majority in the Assembly, and deadlocks would be continuous. The proposal might be modified by diyiding the Colony into four or five constituencies with Proportional Legislation, more particularly if that system is not adopted for the Assembly, in view of the illiteracy of the mass of the general electors.  But an alternative which is favoured in many quarters in Malta is that the principle of class representation should really be carried into effect, either by appointing to the Senate ex officio the recognised leaders for the time being of the various classes, v.g., the Bishops of Malta and Gozo, the Presidents of the Committee of Privileges of the Nobility, of the Chamber of Advocates, Chamber of Commerce, Trade Union Council, &amp;c, or by having representatives specially elected by these various bodies. An improvement upon this alternative, at any rate from the point of view of preventing permanent divergencies between the two classes, would be to supplement the Senators so selected by an equal or larger number of Senators, belonging to the same classes, but elected by the Assembly by Proportional Representation.   The total numbers of the Senate, on any of these lines, should not exceed 15 or 20.37. The life of the Assembly in the draft Constitution is fixed at four years, and that of the Senate at six. A shorter period for the former, say, three years, would be better in order to ensure closer touch with the electorate. The position of a Senator, on the other hand, should be more independent of the fluctuations of public opinion and the need of conciliating constituents, and he should hold his seat for at least six, possibly nine, years. Independence of temporary fluctuations would also be promoted by providing that half (or in the case of a nine years&apos; period, one-third) of the Senate should retire every three years.38. The settlement of the language question ought to be clearly defined from the outset and laid down in the Constitution.. As far as the legislature is concerned, Canada and South Africa both afford sufficient precedents for dealing with the problem of two official languages. In the case of Malta it will, however, probably be necessary to provide also for the right of members to address the chair in Maltese, the only language spoken by the overwhelming majority of the population. The opportunity should also be taken to improve the position of English in the Courts as far as this can be done without reviving the agitation of 1898. Beyond this there should be a general provision in the Constitution laying down that - nothing should be done, either by way of legislation or administration, to prejudice the position of the English language in education or in the public service. The best concordat as regards education-if the improved political atmosphere allows of it-would be to lay down that English should be the &quot; language of utility,&quot; and rhould be the language taught in the primary schools, while Italian should be coequal with it as a &quot; language of culture &quot; in the secondary schools.
39. The National Assembly have asked that the Constitution to be granted to Malta should be embodied in an Act of the Imperial Parliament. It is, no doubt, desirable that the Constitution should be laid down with the greatest possible detail and definiteness, and that its inauguration should be invested with all possible circumstance of dignity and importance. From this point of view it would, no doubt, be advantageous to have an Imperial Act, quite apart from the particular reason which probably influenced the National Assembly, viz., the fear of the Constitution being revoked, like that of 1887, by new Letters Patent. But there may be practical difficulties in the way of finding time for such legislation, and, if so, it might be sufficient if a definite declaration were made that the new Constitution would not be withdrawn or modified except with the previous sanction of the Imperial Parliament, and if the actual issue of the Letters Patent or Order in Council were invested with sufficient ceremony.40. There is good reason to hope that the grant of responsible local self-government &apos;on the above lines will not only satisfy public opinion in Malta, but will substitute for the sterile bickerings and increasing embitterment of the last generation a period of peaceful development and of a steady growth in the attach-ment of the Maltese people to the Imperial connection and of their pride in being members of the British Commonwealth.41. I have already expressed the conviction that this desirable result can be achieved without in any way interfering with the effective use of Malta, as a geographical key position, by the Imperial Forces. But it seems to me that the mere negative safeguarding of the interests of Imperial defence in their relation to the Maltese people is a very inadequate and shortsighted way of dealing with the problem. The people of Malta can, I believe, be made as essential an element in Imperial defence as the geographical position of the Island itself. The first step is,&apos; no doubt, to secure their contentment and loyalty. But the next step is to enlist the energy and endurance, the technical skill and the seafaring aptitude of the overflowing population of Malta in the Imperial services. It is a grievance of the Maltese that, though allowed to enlist temporarily in the local Naval Estab-lishments, they are not allowed to enter the permanent establishment of the Royal Navy. This grievance should be remedied, and enlistment not only thrown open to Maltese, but a training establishment created for training Maltese boys for the Navy and Mercantile Service. The existing battalions of Malta Militia should be retained and brought up to the standard of other Regular units, one of them being regularly stationed outside Malta like the oversea battalion of a British regiment. British units stationed in Malta should also be encouraged to fill up vacancies by the recruitment of Maltese either direct or by transfer from Maltese units. Such a policy has, I understand, already been followed in the Artillery, the Army Service Corps and in the Royal Air Force, on a small scale, but with excellent results. An effort should be made to secure young men of the better class for the commissioned ranks of all the Imperial services. Last but not least important, or least difficult  the individual members of the Imperial Forces in Malta should be encouraged to break down the present barrier of social isolation which they maintain in so large a degree against the community among which they live.42. With the dissipation of the German naval menace, and with the revival of the Eastern problem in a new form, the importance of Malta in our scheme of Imperial defence is certain to increase. Hitherto we have regarded Malta purely as a naval and military station, and have ignored, or kept at arm&apos;s length, the Maltese community. We cannot afford in future to pursue such a policy with a people of nearly a quarter of a million of European race, placed in so admirable a situation for co-operation in the task of maintaining the security of our Imperial communications. Our task is to make the best of that people by developing their capacities alike for industrial effort, for political self-government and for Imperial service, We must give up thinking of Malta as a curious little old-world dependency; living on the&apos;outskirts of a British fortress and providing cheap labour for a British dockyard. We must regard it rather as an outlier of the British Isles, flanking the southern shores of Europe as England flanks the northern, and its people as in a very direct and intimate sense our fellow citizens and fellow countrymen.L.

This increase in cost of over 100 per cent, entailed an annual additional expenditure to Government of about  33,000, and to provide for this, as well as to keep down consumption, it was arranged that the local Government should levy an additional charge of  2 per ton for coal supplied to non-Government enterprises, the resultant price,  9, being lower than the then current market price, viz.,  11- 12 per ton. Between December, 1917, and March, 1919, 19,487 tons were then supplied to Government by the Admiralty, costing, at  7 a ton,  136,410.During 19.16-17 coal was sujmlied by the Admiralty to the army at Malta at  2 a ton, and during 1918 at an average price of  5 5s. per ton. The price at which naval officers could obtain coal on repayment during 1918 was between  2 and  3 per ton, and, from a statement in Parliament by Mr. Chiozza Money, it appears that coal was supplied to Italy during 19.18 at a cost of about  2 1L\ per ton.While it is possible that the Admiralty price may have been fixed with reference to general expenditure, and not with special regard to the cost of the coal delivered at Malta, it seems probable that the price which the Malta Government was required to pay was more than the cost to the Admiralty.Taking the quantities given above,,the difference in cost at the prices charged to the Civil Government and to the Military would be as follows:  Tons.

; &apos; in. &apos;DESPATCH&apos; - from field-IAKSHAL LORD PLUIER.Malta.(Confidential.) &apos;   The Palace, Valletta, 19th September, 191b.My Lord,In your Confidential despatch of the 9th May, I was instructed to consider whether, without prejudicing Imperial interests, it was possible to accord to these Islands a Constitution involving a greater measure of self-government than they have at present.2. On my arrival here in June regrettable disturbances had occurred, attributed by some to the general discontent with the Government, and, in the abnormal condi-tions of excitement which then prevailed among all classes of the community, it was difficult to appreciate the real state of affairs. The -excitement has now subsided; it is possible to review the political situation calmly, and I have no hesitation-in-saying that, in my opinion, the present form of Government cannot continue.3. It is unnecessary to recapitulate the various steps which have been taken in the last thirty years in framing and amending the Constitution of Malta; they are well known to your Lordship, and Colonel Amery, with whom I have had the advan-tage of discussing the question during the past fortnight, has described them in the admirable report which he has, I know, submitted to you.4. I am sure that we have reached a point here now when we must either adopt a reactionary policy, i.e., abandon all pretence of letting the Maltese manage their own affairs, and control the Island almost as if it were an &quot; occupied &quot; country, or accord to the people a generous -measure of self-government, involving real responsibility for the conduct of all local administration. I cannot imagine for a moment that the former would commend itself to His Majesty&apos;s Government, and it certainly would not to me, and I strongly recommend the adoption of the latter course.5. I wish to say that before submitting the proposals contained in this report I have examined very carefully the bearing they may have on Imperial interests. Malta has been rightly regarded as a &quot; Portress of the Empire,&quot; and as a fortress must be a source of strength and not of weakness, no measures should even be considered which might lessen its value in that capacity. In my opinion, in the proposed form of self-government, Imperial interests can be securely safeguarded.. Naval and Military requirements will always be of first importance, and it will be made quite clear that local claims and considerations must invariably give way to them. I do not think there is, or ever will be, the slightest desire of the Maltese to contest this:&apos; on the contrary, they fully realise that Imperial security is their security, and if by a liberal delegation to them of authority in local affairs we can make them wholeheartedly loyal to the British Empire, we shall have done more to strengthen the &quot; Fortress &quot; than any increase of armament or defensive works, no matter how extensive or costly.-6. If it is conceded that matters cannot be left as they are, that the delegation of real self-government is desirable, and that this can be accorded without any danger to Imperial interest, the character of the people of Malta and Gozo must be examined in order to anticipate what use they are likely to make of the opportunities that will be afforded them for development and progress.The Maltese have never been a governing race: they have always been under the protection of, and subservient to&apos;, a more powerful&apos; nation, and consequently they have never acquired the instinct of authority or command. They are a sensible, reasonable people,, naturally law-abiding and obedient to authority, sober, hard-working for the most part, and thrifty, domestic in their character, and affectionate husbands and sons. Their weakness lies in their utter lack of initiative and power of assuming responsibility. This must be attributed to their history as a race and to their backwardness in education, the latter being in turn due to our own failure to introduce and maintain a sound educational system, to the difficulties and disputes connected with the English, Italian, and Maltese languages, and to the superstitious reliance on the Parish Priests.7. It may seem rash to entrust governing powers to a people of such past history and character, but&apos;I am convinced that no real progress or development is
&apos;possible unless or until.the Maltese are taught initiative and trained to assume responsibility. I think that we shall find that if? self-government is given to them the difficulty will not be to restrain them from introducing rash or ill-considered measures, but to instil into them the courage to carry out reforms really essential.8. I strongly recommend His Majesty&apos;s Government to make the experiment now, but I agree with what I know Colonel Amery has recommended, viz., that though the reforms as regards the legislature and general conduct of affairs should be carried out at once, there should be a &quot; probationary &quot; period during which certain services should be &quot; reserved &quot; to be dealt with by the Imperial representatives.9. I think this period should be two years. This will, I consider, show to the Maltese that His Majesty&apos;s Government have no wish to defer unduly the full &quot;measure of self-government it is proposed to give them, and it will afford sufficient time to train inexperienced officials in their duties and responsibilities, to fit in the component parts of the Government machine, and if necessary to make any amend-ments or modification before the Constitution is finally launched to steer itself.10. When I received your Lordship&apos;s despatch referred to above, directing me to consider possible reforms of the Constitution, I invited representative bodies and men holding official and responsible positions, to send me in, either collectively or individually, any proposals or suggestions they wished to put forward, and I undertook that all these should not only be considered by me but should be forwarded to Your Lordship. It is important I am sure that it should be under-stood throughout the Island that all opinions have been represented and carefully weighed before the final decision is arrived at. In response to my invitation I have received and enclose proposals from Mr. W. C. F: Robertson, C.M.G. (Lieutenant-Governor), Professor M. A. Refalo, C.B.E., LL.D. (Chief Justice), Major General W. C. Hunter-Blair, C.B., C.M.G., Mr. L. Gatt, C.M.G. (Superintendent of Public Works), Mr. E. Bonavia, C.M.G. (Assistant Secretary to Government), the &quot; National Assembly,&quot; the Elected Members of the Council of Government, Judge Parnis, O.B.E., LL.D., and Judges Micallef, Agius and Cremona, Mr. Vizzari and Marchese Apap Bologna. For convenience of reference these and their main out-lines have been tabulated and are shown in Annexure A.11. It will be noticed that the Government officials and those who have held or are holding responsible positions advocate a Constitution based more or less on that which obtained in 1887, but that bodies of citizens who claim with some right to represent the electorate, advocate a far wider scheme approaching almost to complete autonomy.12.  My own recommendations are as follows : (a) There must be definite provision in the Constitution that, as at present, the English language has at least an equal right with Italian as the official language.(b) There should be two Chambers of Legislature : i. The Senate.ii. The Chamber of Deputies.The Chief Justice should preside over the Senate. The Chamber of Deputies should elect their own President.(o) In addition to the Chief Justice the General Officer Commanding the Troops (or other Military Officer nominated by the Governor) and the Admiral Superintendent of the Dockyard should be ex officio Members of the Senate.The other Members of the Senate should be : Members representative of &quot; Classes.&quot;Clergy (nominated by the Archbishop)............ 1Nobility (elected by the Nobility)       ............ 1University (elected by the University)............. 1Chamber of Commerce (elected by the Chamber of Commerce) 1&apos; * &quot;&apos;4Elected by Deputies.For Malta ...................     10For Gozo............      ...      ......      .1-11The Senate would then be composed of a President and 17 Members. -&apos; (d) I attach importance to the inclusion of representatives of the Navy and Army in the Senate. Constant intercourse and interchange of views would, I am sure, be beneficial both to the two services and to the civil community, and there are many matters which might be the subject of proposed legislature which would not affect Naval or Military interests as such, but which might be matters of concern to members of both Forces as temporary citizens of the Island.
(e) The qualifications for Members of the Senate might well be those enumerated in the proposals of the body of citizens who style themselves the &quot;National Assembly.&quot; Those elected might or might not be men already elected as members of the Chamber of Deputies. In the former case a fresh Deputy would be elected for that constituency. The Chamber of Deputies might consist of 33 Members, of whom 30 would be for Malta and 3 for Gozo.(/) The qualifications for electors and persons eligible for election as Deputies should be as at present, with certain possible extensions and amendments.(g) There should be the following Departments :  Law and Justice.Finance (including Customs and Post Office).Education.Public Works.Health and Charitable Institutions. Agriculture and Fisheries.(h) The Crown Advocate and the Treasurer should be the respective Heads of the Law and Finance Departments, and the others should be controlled by Boards of 5 members, of whom at least 2 should be Members of the Chamber of Deputies, the Heads of Departments being selected by the Governor on the advice of the leader of the majority in the Chamber of Deputies from the Members of the Senate or Chamber of Deputies.(i) Heads of Departments who are members of one Chamber should have the right to attend and speak in the other, but not to vote.(j) Legislative measures may be introduced in either Chamber by the Head of the Department concerned.(k) They must be passed by both Chambers before being sent up to the Governor for approval, and all measures must be approved by the Governor before becoming operative.(i) In the case of disagreement between the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, the Governor may at his discretion order a joint sitting of the two Chambers, and the matter at issue may be decided by a majority of two-thirds of those present.(m) To assist the Governor there shall be an Executive Council composed as under: The Naval Commander-in-Chief or a representative deputed by him. The General Officer Commanding the Troops or a Military Officernominated by the Governor. The Lieutenant-Governor. The Crown Advocate. The Treasurer.The Heads of Departments referred to in paragraph 12 (g). (n) The Lieu tenant-Governor should be the Imperial Secretary and act as such in all matters affecting Imperial interest and revenue, and should be the medium of all communications between the Legislature and the Governor as representative of the Government.(o) In all matters affecting Imperial interest the Governor will be assisted by the Lieutenant-Governor and the Naval and Military representatives; and in all local matters by the Lieutenant-Governor and the Heads of Departments.(p) It will be for the Governor to decide what are matters affecting Imperial interests subject to an appeal to the Secretary of State.(q) At the same time, for the guidance of the two Chambers, it should be laid down that certain matters such as the control of all Imperial formations and establishments, Defence Regulations, Control of Aviation, Merchant Shipping, Bunkering, Cable and Wireless, Passport Regulations, &amp;c, &amp;c, must necessarily and always be matters affecting Imperial interests.(r) The period of election to the Senate should, I think, be six years and to the Chamber of Deputies three years.(s) The Governor should have the power to prorogue or dissolve either or both Chambers.(t) Elected and representative Members of both Houses should have a small fee (10s.) for each attendance.13. The above is an outline of what I propose for the revised Constitution, but, as I indicated before, I concur with Colonel Amery that there should be certain reservations during the first two years. It is a difficult problem to determine these reservations, but believing as I do that there will be more difficulty in ensuring
progress than in restraining extravagance or eccentricities, I am inclined to recom-V mend that none of the Departments as such should be &quot; reserved &quot; except that of the &quot;Law.&quot; &apos;       &apos;     ...14. The Police and the Prisons must be reserved and kept under the Lieu-tenant-Governor, and certain sums must be set aside for expenditure from the revenue on such matters as roads, drainage, &amp;c3 under the direction of the Governor and the Executive Council, and, similarly, definite sums must be allotted for the promotion of education and the development of agriculture, and as regards educa-tion there must be a definite understanding that there is at any rate no weakening of present policy as regards the teaching of the English language.15. I have not alluded to the question of a Civil as opposed to a Military Governor : it is perhaps rather a personal matter, but, even in the short time I have been here, I am convinced that both in the Imperial interest and in the interest of the Civil community a Military Governor must be the most advantageous. In case of war, of course, any^ divided responsibility would be out of the question.16. I have not, however, as I have stated, attempted to give more than an outline of the reforms and there are many points of detail which require to be carefully considered. The Lieutenant-Governor in his report has referred to many of them, and I concur generally with his suggestions.17. It is unnecessary to go into them unless or until His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have expressed their approval to the principles of the scheme. They are certainly far reaching, but I am confident they can be safely introduced and that the time for doing so is opportune.I have the honour to be, My Lord,Your Lordship&apos;s most obedient humble servant,HERBERT PLUMER, Field-Marshal.Governor.The Right HonourableViscount Milner, G.C.B., &amp;c, &amp;c, &amp;c.Annexure A.Note on the Constitutional Question by His Honour W. C. F. Robertson, C.M.G., Lieutenant-Governor and Chiee Secretary to Government.His Excellency,Your Excellency has asked me to set forth my views with regard to the Constitutional question in Malta. I have already expressed the opinion that some reform is required which will give the Maltese a greater measilre of control of their own affairs than they now possess. The present system, under which there is a Council of Government composed of eight Elected Members and ten official Heads of Department who are bound to vote as they are instructed by the Governor, amounts to absolutism, an absolutism which is not made more agreeable by being associated with a semblance of popular control which can never be substantial.2. A really absolute Government in which the Council consisted solely of Executive Officers would probably provide the most convenient and effective form of administration. But it is not likely that such a Government could be established without the creation of united hostility on the part of the Maltese to the British Crown, and this result may even be expected to follow the continuance of the present form of Government. If the only course that is not certain to produce that result is to grant the Maltese effective control over their own affairs, that course must, it seems, be adopted, provided that this can be done without prejudicing the interests of the Empire as a whole.3. At first sight it would appear that the functions of administration in Malta are mainly municipal, and that the demand for local Government might be met by the institution of a system of Elected District Councils with a Central Con-fh trolling Council, also elected, provision being made for the establishment of rates and the raising of funds by loan. The Executive Government to consist of a Council composed of the Governor, the Lieutenant-Governor, the Treasurer, Crown Advocate and. three Members appointed by the Central Council with legislative &quot;and..administrative.:.powers&apos;; the.&apos; Courts, Treasury, Customs, Post Office and
University being under the control of this Council, all other Departments being administered by the Central Council which would be&apos; responsible for all expenditure connected with&apos; such departments for which revenue up to an agreed limit would be assigned by the Executive Council. I have been inclined to favour an arrange-ment of this kind, an amplification on democratic lines of the system of administra-tion by the Sanitary Commissioners at Gibraltar. I fear, however, &apos;that although a system such as this, if introduced some years ago, might have developed into a satisfactory form of Government, there is little prospect that it would now satisfy the political aspirations of the Maltese or indeed conform with the trend of modern ideas of Government, and one must rather look to work down to the creation of a sense of municipal responsibility in Malta, than hope to work up from it to&apos;a higher form of Government.4. Most of the suggestions put forward for a reform of the Constitution so as to give the Maltese a greater share in the control of their own affairs-all, I think, that have come from the Heads of Department have amounted to a proposal to restore the Constitution of 1887, either completely op in a modified form. That Constitution did not work successfully and it is reasonable to doubt whether it would prove any more successful if now restored. Most of the administrative power was left in the hands of the Executive Council of Government, but the Government repre-sentatives were in a position of numerical inferiority in the Council, and to secure the support of the deputies in such circumstances seems to postulate infinite sympathy on the part of the latter or almost incredible subservience. It is indeed remarkable that a Constitution in which the Government occupied such a peculiar position of inferiority, and the Elected Members such freedom from responsibility, could have lasted so long as it did. If a Council of Government be established in which the elected element is in the majority the presence on it of permanent Govern-ment officials would appear to be useless, and a Chamber composed entirely of Elected Members seems therefore to be the first step in any scheme of reform. A Chamber whose authority is limited to control of votes and none of whose members have a responsible share in the duties of administration cannot be considered as more than a body of critics. If there is to be effective control of affairs the members must have responsibility for departmental administration, and the next step is to provide that the Government Departments shall be presided over by an Elected Member of the Council as head.5. I have had the advantage of reading Colonel Amery&apos;s report and recom-mendations, and of discussing these with him and with Your Excellency. I agree generally with all his proposals. I admit that I have hesitated in the matter of the Senate or Upper Chamber, first because the necessity for it was not clear, and next because it seems likely that when the political question ceases to be of interest or importance, as it should under a new Constitution, attention will be concentrated on socialistic or labour problems, and a Chamber composed of representatives of class interests might not be expected to regard such problems with special sympathy. But as a restraining influence in the initial stages of a new and experimental Constitu-tion, I think now that the Senate should be included.6. With regard to the question of the appointment of Boards or Councils for the administration of certain Departments, these should, I think, be given powers of control by legislation. The Council of the Government, for example, has such powers. The Education Department comprising Elementary and Secondary Educa-tion might be placed under a Board with defined and very general authority. There is now a Board of Health which deals with various questions such as Quarantine, measures connected with the treatment of infectious diseases, &amp;c. This Board might be granted more extended powers, and perhaps might take over control of the Hospitals which are now, somewhat anomalously, under the Comptroller of Charitable Institutions. The harbours are now administered by the Collector of Customs. It might be more convenient to vest the control in a Board or Committee on which the Navy and Army should be represented. A Board of Works-also with Naval and Military representatives might control roads, drainage, water supply, railway, and electric light, and any other enterprise in this direction undertaken by the Government.7. There is,- perhaps, no great advantage in going closely into details until the general principles laid down in Colonel Amery&apos;s report have been considered. The definition of questions that are to be regarded as Imperial will present difficulty, and it is unlikely that precise definition will be possible.&apos; The Governor must have the power to decide in doubtful cases, if necessary with appeal to the Secretary of
State. Administration of Naval, Military and Air Departments stands, of course, apart, but there are many other matters in which the Imperial Government may be directly or indirectly concerned such as drainage, water supply, control of harbour and shipping movements, roads and transport. Even though the principle were recognised that payment for such services should be made by the Imperial Govern-ment, some guarantee would be required (1) that the service should actually be rendered, if considered indispensable by the department concerned, and (2) that the basis of payment or contribution should be fair and reasonable, and should take some account of the advantage to the Civil community of the particular work.8. Provided that the authority of the University Council and the proposed Education Board could be safeguarded, and that it were guaranteed that the English language should not be placed in a position of disadvantage, it would be better, I think, that control of education should not be reserved. As regards the Treasury, there are several difficulties. The staff now employed by Government have certain rights of which they cannot fairly be deprived, and these require to be protected. Perhaps during the transition period expenditure might be provided by law to cover services which must be guaranteed, Interests and Burthens, Pensions, the Governors and Lieutenant-Governor&apos;s Establishments, Legal Departments, Police and Prisons, the proposed Department for Science and Industries, or Agriculture and Industries, and safeguards provided for the rights of Government servants. The revenue accruing from rents, interest, Avith the Imperial contribution, if this be approved on the lines proposed by Colonel Amery, should be sufficient to cover these charges.The control of the Treasury and of expenditure and revenue apart from the items mentioned could then be transferred to the new Government.The question of the power of veto by the Governor on legislation enacted by the Legislative Assembly or Senate is not specially mentioned in Colonel Amery&apos;s report. I think this should be retained. With an Executive Council in the form proposed, and an Executive in close touch with the Assembly and Senate, it is improbable that any measures would be passed without an opportunity being given to the Governor of making his views known, and of the fullest discussion. The power of veto, however, even if rarely likely to be used, provides a safeguard to the Constitution which the people of Malta no less than the Imperial Government have a right to demand.W.
