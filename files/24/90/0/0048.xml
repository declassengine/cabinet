Copy of ^telegram from Lord Derby to the foreign Office.Deoypher--  Lord Derby (Pi-ris) october 14th, 1919. D..   11.15 ;p.m, October 14th, 19&apos;19. R.   8,50 a-.m, October 15tht 1919.Ho. 1098.suB-comiTra.My telegram l\o. 1095 of to-day.following is Mi Clemenceau1a reply to telegrams&apos; from Mr. Lloyd George.&quot;General Gouraud is. at Strhssburg.. It would be materially impossible for him to come to London in time,   it would moreover havo been impossible,for me to authorise him. to, take part in meeting.     It is duty of Prench Government to negotiate with British Government ana General Gouraud would only have- discussed methods of carrying out decisions arrived at by Irenoh Government regarding decision of Supreme Council which-was-limited to question of relief of British troops by P..ench troops in Oilicia and Syria (Blue Sons),   as &quot;regards request of Eair: ifeisal.that an American delegate should take part in conversations;, with British Government, I do not admit that he has any right tot?.ke such an initiative.(Beginning of. D)v .If American Government itself expressed;a- desire of this kind I should not oppose it.   There can however be ho question of settling Syrian question itself in an unofficial meeting of&apos;this. kind.   It is the business of Conference alone to/take a definite decision on (? question, omitted.)F of1 Syria and Mesopotamia at the same time g.s on fete of Ottoman Smpire.I continue &quot;to regret that amir :--feisal should have been summoned by British Government without previous consultation with Aenbh Government for that does not help&apos;to facilitate e solution.   Ques-tion must be put back where it really belongs as. &apos;I pointed out on October 9th in my answer-to Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s Memorandum of September 13th position of France in Gyria.and her relations with Arabs in her zone cannot be otherwise than identical with position of England in He sonotami a and with her relations with Arabs in her zone.     It is business of 1? anco to come to a direct understanding with 3mir ,&apos;feisal but how will&apos; e-n - understanding be possible if Emir who lays claim, to sovereignty of whole of Syria, continues to be protege-of -Gnf;l-;nd?   This, protection eucoura,.es Smirrs ambition and his resistance.-and rlsiis cresting- in Arab zone at&apos;moment when French troops Will replace (;? British troopsi:to Blue Mm a -state of excitement nil tho more dangerous-/in
in that Arrb forces recruited in hr.ste have been armed by English. v;ith rifles, machine guns and armoured cars.Theory that consists in cutting Syria into two water-tight zones IB contrary not only to agreements of 1916 but to nature of things and to simple common sense rights (groups undecypherable)*      I thoroughly understand difficulty in which English negotiators find themselves after being driven by political necessities to enter into engagements in Hedjaz in we did and with France which if not in opposition the one to other are at any rate difficult to adjust.But solution cannot consist in sacrificing French rights end interests and in placing us in a false position as regards Arabs by warping meaning of agreements of 1916 at moment when de facto British occupation of Syria which resulted from the wa is coming to an end and by asking us to accept a situation, which has been rendered dangerous by promises made to Arabs and by military.means imprudently lavished on them which Can only be used against us.There is in reality but one issue worthy of great country and loyal ally who has treaties with us* - That is to hand situation frankly over to uc*   Let British Government tell Feisal plainly to come to an understanding with ug.o Let it conform to letter and spirit of our agreements (of which Article 1 says two Governments engage to &quot;recognise and protect an Arab State or a Confederation of Arab States in&quot;&quot; zones A and B,J), then it will be able to leave without fear of responsibility for situation to France who will well be able to come to an understanding with Arab Emir and to emerge from present difficulties by bearing in mind at the same time her liberal and generous traditions towards Mussulmans, her respect for her engagements and a carefully considered (group undecipherable).These are lines upon which 1 am ready to meet Emir, Feisal on his way through Peris if he expresses desire to see me and to come to an arrangement.&quot;Text by bag to-nig).it.(15.10    8/4),
