Memorandum by the Home Secretary.OITIZSK   GUARDS.The railway strike was settled within 36 hours of the publication of the Government&apos;8 appeal for the formation of Citizen Guards, and although it appears that in many case3 immediate action was taken by the local authorities concerned, proceedings were held up on the news cf the settlement of the strike being received * and a great deal of uncertainty exists as to whether the formation of Citizen Guards should be proceeded with at all and as to what form the organiza-tion should take.From the reception given to the &quot;Appeal&quot; by the Press, it appeared that the title &quot;Citizen Guards&quot; was likely to be popular and to stimulate recruiting, but reports which have been received from various localities, and especially from the industrial&apos;1&apos;&quot;districts, shew that the reverse is the case.     In these districts the name Citizen Guards is very unpopular.     It is supposed that the Guard will be of a semi-nilitary description and Trill be armed, and it is useless to attempt to explain that it is merely another form of Special Constabulary and intended for purely police duties.     In many districts where a well-organized Special Constabulary exists, the attempt to create a Citizen Guard would not only be a failure, but would seriously affect the reoruiting of Special Constables, and in more than one case the Special Constables have threatened to resign in a body if any Citizen Guard is formed.    With only one or two exceptions, it seems to be the unanimous opinion of the authorities concerned that the desired objects car best be obtained by expanding and strengthening the Special Constabulary.     Their view is that the existing Special Constables are mostly men of low military category or over military age: but that it will now be possible to recruit from a large number of young men of fine physique and some years1 war experience, and there should in time of emergency be no difficulty in getting many of them to enrol for servioe as Special Constables.    Opinions in this sense have been       * received from such Counties as Durham, Norfolk, Northumberland, Lincolnshire,    * Flint * Cornwall, and the North and West Ridings;   and Boroughs such as Manchester, Middlesbrough, Nottingham, and Leicester.     The Chief Constable of the County of Stafford and the Mayor of Worcestert on the other hand, are in favour of the creation of Citizen Guards and think that any attempt to increase their Special Constabulary would fail.     It has been suggested that it might be left to the locality to decide whether they should develop their Special Constabulary or should proceed with the formation of a Citizen Guard, but it is clear that, if the question were left open, a great majority of localities would decide against setting up a separate organization under the title &quot;Citizen Guard&quot;, and it is probable that the existence of Citizen Guards under that name in one or two places would seriously prejudice the recruiting of Special Constables throughout the country.
If men - many of whom are Trades Unionists - are to be induced to give their services for the purpose of protection of life and property in time of emergency -   which of course means in i&apos;ime&apos;of labour trouble - it is absolutely necessary that four principles should be made olear beyond the possibility of any misunderstanding:-     &apos;       &apos;&quot;&quot;        &quot;!&apos;   &apos;        &apos;Firsts that the organisation is purely a civil and not in any sense&apos;a military one;Secondly, that the main object of having such an organisation is to avoid&apos;&apos; the necessity of calling.in the military to preserve order and to protect life and property;&apos;Thirdlyi that the organisation is entirely local and is under the direction and control of the local police authorities.Fourthly, that it is in no sense an organisation for strike breaking.For.the above reasons I recommend that the formation of Citizen Guards&apos; should be, dropped and that: Police: Authorities be asked to concentrate their efforts on strengthening their Special Constabulary so as to form an efficient &apos; Police Reserve.- They should perfect their organisation, disband the older&apos;and&apos; less efficient members of the Forpe and secure as many suitable men as they can, particularly experienced men who would be qualified and ready to act as officers in the event, of an emergency involving a sudden expansion, of the Force.E.S. ...23rd October, 1919.
