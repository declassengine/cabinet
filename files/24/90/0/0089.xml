BALTIC AND NORTH RUSSIA.

S.N.O&apos;s report on the situation at Riga dated 15th October stated that the Germans were apparently an the left bank only of the Dwina River and that Letts were holding their own. He had required the German Force on the River Dwina to withdraw by noon on October 11th, failing which he would shell them. Naval Section, Paris, was informed of this, but as it was considered impossible to obtain a decision on this subject from the Supreme War Council before the hour mentioned, the S.N.O. was informed that he must use his discretion in the matter, resting assured of Admiralty support. This was confirmed later by the Supreme Council.

The German reply to this ultimatum stated that troops were not German but Russian. S.N.O. then authorised the French Commodore to bombard Riga, taking H.M. Ships "Dragon" and "Cleopatra" under his orders. The bombardment was carried out on 15th October, the result being that Lettish troops were enable to cross to the West Bank of the River Dwina.

The Russian Colonel Bermont claims to be a representative of a Nation allied with England. S.N.O. has required him to explain firing on positions near which Allied vessels were berthed and further to report the withdrawal of his troops from Riga.

(Missions were embarked in H.M.S. "Princess Margaret").

On 16th October the situation at Riga was reported to be satisfactory. Letts were holding their line and had capture 300 prisoners and 20 machine guns. The Allied squadron is remaining up river in support.

The numbers of workmen and clerical staff will be reduced shortly to much below the former peace strength,,    The major portion of the Kiel Imperial Dockyard is to be transformed into a State owned mercantile lard.   It is reported that the Baltic Shipbuilding Works at Eeval hare been acquired by Germany.It is likely that the official ratification of the Peace Treaty will be delayed by the situation in the Baltic as, once the Treaty is ratified and peace therefore made, German shipping could freely navigate the Baltic without asking per-mission.   The withholding of these permits is one of the urinci-pmi weapons of the Allies for enforcing their will on the German Government and compelling it to do all&quot;possible to ensure the withdrawal of : the recalcitrant German troops-

Corroborative reports as to tho inefficiency of the volunteer Flotilla recently turned over by the British, continue to come in..  This deplorable condition can but emphasise the vital necessity of holding Tsarytsin, as otherwise re-inforoements from the North via the Volga will give the Bolsheviks command of the Caspian. The British prizes taken at Ashurada have beenaphfor prize-moneyIt is reported that while the possibilities and conditions are still serious, hostilities need not be further anticipated at Spalato.On 5th October it was reported that Italian Battle-ship &quot;Dandolo&quot; and all Italian troops have left Cattaro for Durazzo.

the ship was on active service.. Six of the prisoners were con-demned to degradation in addition to teuis oi detention vary-ing from six to fifteen years; /twenty received sentences of from six months to five years, and seven were acquitted.It is noteworthy that the ages.of the mutineers of . the &quot;Irovence&quot; ranged from 19 to 2$ years.Admiral Grasaet, late French Naval Attache in London, has heen appointed Commander-in--Chief at Cherbourg. &apos;The press has begun to discuss the method to be adopted for the partition of the German merchant ships.   The same arguments are being used as in the case of German war-vessels; &quot;to prove that France is entitled to a great deal more than her share would be if worked out in proportion to her losses,   The claim is made that France should first have all her war losses made good and then take a share in what remains over *Proposals have been laid before the Minister of ;&apos;fcr in Belgium with reference to the construction and establishment of a naval service.The Belgian Navy will, if possible consist of -6 Monitors armed with 9*2&quot; long range guns similar tothe British Gorgon class. 12 Destroyers of light draught for coastal patrol work which could be carried out in any weather, and also for minelaying. 24 small Torpedo&quot;Boats for river work and minesweeping. SO Coastal Motor Beats about 35 kn. speed, armament 1 torpedo and 1 or 2 Lewis guns.   These could also be used as minelayers, as could the small torpedo boats if requiredoThe grounds on which these vessels have been chosen are :-(l) cost, (2) existing and probable future facilities for upkeep, (3) length of coast line to be defended, and (4) decisive superiority against next possible enemy, viz. HollandoIt is generally accepted that Belgium can never conduct much in ifee way of offensive operations at sea:   her Navy must therefore be of the nature of a defence and police force, and her coast batteries must form her defence against heavy bombardment from seaward.The displacement of the Destroyers will be from 800 to 900 tons, with a draught of under 10 feet; their endurance will be low,The cost of the building and purchase of the Navy is estimated to be a hundred million francs and the annual main-tenance for upkeep twenty-five million francs.The officer personnel proposed is :-1 Rear Admiral, 4 Captains, 12 Commanders, 100 Lieutenant-Commanders or Lieutenants, 75 Sub-Lieutenants, 100 Engineer Officers, 15 Accountant Officers, 10 Surgeons, 4 Naval Instructors.Tho Belgians have not yet decided whether to ask for a Naval Mission from France, America or England.   The ouestion of obtaining Destroyers and other vessels on loan for immediate training purposes is under consideration.im,i.With reference to the recent official communique to the Italian Press announcing the despatch of a Note by theBri ti sh ...
British Government to the Italian Government on the Ftee quest!or, tho Italian Government have issued a further com-mmxique to the effect that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has had a friandlv conversation with the British Ambassador which has resultea in clearing up any misunderstanding,, and has made it clear that the two countries will cordially collaborate to find a solution for problems of peace0The SoGo &quot;Persist reported in last week8s summary to be loading arms and ammunition at Spezia for use against the Bolshevists, altered course at sea, and went to Fiume, where her cargo vas handed over to D?AnnunziOeAdmiral de Rebeck, whon passing through Borne do take up his command, gathered the impression that the Italians dislike us least of&apos;the Allies, while they candidly hate the French, about whose conduct they complain Mtteriy8The Alde-de-Canip to the Minister of ferine visited him and &amp;ave his views on the situations   It appears probable that thev will?;educe their Navy to the lowest possible point as regards commissioned ships,   Tho superior Naval opinion is that Austria has been for 25 years the enemy of  Italy.  She has now ceased to exist as a Naval power, and France is now a hated rival,    With this in view the intention is to make Spezzia into a first class port, both Military and Naval; also Ma&amp;dalena in Sardinia is to be brought up to date.   In faotp Italy intends to transfer her Naval front from the Adriatic to the V/est of I taly 0   They have iso intention of spending money in or developing Tripoli0 but intend to do all they can to bring Albania under their rule.  .
