M&amp;MORAHDTJM BY THE MIWIBTEE 0? HEALTH,I h:..ve been asked to receive a Deputation from London Members of the Labour Party to discuss the question of removing the doubt which exists whether discharged soldiers and sailors between the ages of 19 and 21 may be registered as electors.Provision is made in the Representation of the People Act, 1918. enabling male naval or military voters who have served in or in connection with the War to be registered as Parliamentary electors if 19 years of age or over during service, but it is&quot;not quite clear whether the right of a man under 21 to be registered continues after his discharge from the.Forces. -Prominence has been given to the question owing to a decision of a County Court Judge, on appeal from the Registration Officer, against the claim in an individual case.   The English and Scottish Law Officers who have been consulted, consider that the discharged man under 21 is entitled to be registered, but the Irish Law Officers take the opposite view.It] a discussion in the House of Commons on 29th July, Mr. Bonar Law referred to the clear Intention of Parliament that the men should heave the franchise and It was considered that as Registration Officers would no doubt accept this -expression of view, legislation was hardly necessary.   The ruling of the County Court Judge referred to did not settle the law. to do this it would be necessary that a test case should b^ taken to the Court of Appeal.The
The Labour Party str,te that Registration Officers consider it their duty to administer the Ian as it stands, but give no particulars as to the number of claims rejected. From inquiries made it appears to be the practice of Registration Officers in London to include such cases in the register. Outside London, so far as can be ascertained., the areas where the franchise is refused are but few.The Viar Office estimate that the number of discharged men under 21 is considerably over 250,000.It seems unlikely that a test case will be taken to the Court of Appeal.   Registration appeals are generally made at the instance of some Political Party, but as the question here will settle itself in two years from the end of the V/ar,-it is probable that none of the Farties will think it worth while to incur the expense of an appeal if, in fact, only a few votes have been refused.I should be glad to have the views of the Cabinet as to the course which 1 should take in regard to the application of the Labour Party,    In view of the demand for an extended franchise for women, there would be some difficulty in introduc-ing legislation dealing only with demobilised men under 21. If it is thought that it would sufficiently meet the case, I should be prepared to Issue a Memorandum to the Registration Officers explaining the way in which the Government interpret the law.try of Health.C.
