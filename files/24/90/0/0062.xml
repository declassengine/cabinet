Ihe documents and facts made known have been very diverse in character and their publication has been inspired by varying motives.     A large number have been published obvious-ly in the interests of Russian Bolshevik, or German propaganda; in meet there was collaboration, whether intentional or not need not be discussed, the Russians very frequently making the- &quot;reve-lations&quot; and the Germans exploiting them.    The second class of &quot;revelation&quot;1 consists of those made by the German Government in their own interests or by individual German politicians in self-iustifieation.    Finally there are disinterested &quot;revelatiens&quot; which though no longer of any immediate practical importance mightnot
not perhaps have seen light under the ol-l regime either in Russiaor in Germany.     This last nh&apos;* from the point of viev: of the pre-sent memorandum least important class v/ill be dealt with first.Considerable interest has been aroused in Germany by the pub-lication in book form, edi^tefl by Kerr Bduatfd Sngeliji of EmperorFrederick III!s diary.     It   ill be remembered that the publication in the &quot;Deutsche Rundschau1.1 :of certain extracts from this diaryby Professor Geffcken the historian led. to his prosecution byBismarck and final disgrace- as a consequence of which the diaryhas remained in obscurity&apos;until the present day.     Another bodyof Imperial r/ritings^has come to light since the armistice is theEx-limp er or \/ilhelm!s correspondence v/ith the Kmperor Franz Joseph .cn Bismarck&apos;s retirement.     This appeared&apos;in the &quot;OesterreichischeRundschau&quot; of January and should not fail to be included in all future biographies of Bismarck or the Sx-jaaperor.     Further lighton Bismarckian foreign policy has also been&apos; shed by the publication(in the &quot;Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; of September 12th) of the text of the so-called. G-ermano-Russien &quot;Ruckversicherungsvertrag.&quot;The treaty..nas,-. of course, that vhich nas allo-.-e:! to lapse byCaprivi when he succeeded Bismarck in 1890 but apart from Bismarck!first revelation of its existence in the &quot;Hamburger Nachrichten&quot;&apos; of24th October, 1896 nothing has been kno^h of its provisions until xnov;.k . . &apos; &apos; .    .  -  : &quot;    7     ^For a brief account of various speculations on the sab:] eot see Appendix B. of lir. w.H. -Day/son^ bock &quot;The German 3Smpire, 1-36?-1914&quot; (George Allen an-i Un^in (1919).
A good many interesting pages concerning Bismarck&apos;s policy in regard to England are to be found in the books "Zur Vorgeschiche des Weltkrieges" and "Der Neue Kurs" by Otto Hamman the famous Chief of the German Foreign Office Press Department. In an appendix Hamman gives the text of Bismarck&apos;s letter of November 27th, 1887, to Lord Salisbury offering an alliance and containing the well-known phrase about "saturierte" states.    This was published in the "Daily Telegraph" for May 13th, 1912, but Lord Salisbury&apos;s reply which appeared in the "Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" of February 16th 1919 (Morgen Ausgabe) has not been known in full until now.  On German-English relations in general between the years 1898-1901 Hamman&apos;s first book is also very informative. The facts he gives concerning the approaches to an Anglo-German alliance and the negotiations, by Prince Bulow and Mr. Chamberlain may be supplemented by another important book, also published since the armistice, namely "Diplomatische Enthulllungen zum Ursprung des Weltkrieges" by Herrman Freiherr von Eckardstein*, as by two individual studies which, though containing nothing particularly new are of considerable interest, namely Herr von Jagow&apos;s book, "Die Ursachen und Ausbruch des Krieges" and Count von Reventlow&apos;s book "Die Vorgeschichte des Weltkrieges."  A good general review, from the Central European standpoint, of European foreign politics during the past forty years is to be found in "Das Zeitalter des Imperialismue" by the Austrian historian Heinrich Friedjung.

* Both Hamman and Eckardstein are reviewed at length in an important article by Professor Gustav Roloff in the September number of the "Preussische Jahrbucher."
, i) -jv yt m   4    -foreign policy in the course of the first six or seven years of the twentieth century concern Denmark and Belgium.     At the beginning of September the Danish.Government issued a White Booh containing the documents relating to the discussions of 1906-07 between Captain Luetkeri, representing the Danish Premier and Minister of Defencej and General von Molt lee, Chief of the General Staff, regarding the posi-tion of Denmark in the event of war.     Ho formal military convention&quot; seems to have been concluded, but von Jnoltke hinted firstly..sb. the probability of a British landing on Danish shores should the war be-tween Great Britain and Germany come about and in the Eonvereatione, of 2nd and 3rd July 1906 refused to give a guarantee that Germany ivoulvi respect Danish neutrality an0 stated that the rectification of the Slesvig frontier*-;could hardly be made until after a war in -w&amp;ieh .. Denmark placed herself by Germanyvs side.   Later in the sarne collec-tion of documents is given the substance of two interesting conversa-tions, the first between King Christian IX and the German.Emperor of December 17th 1903 and the -second between King iviward .VI and. Cwunt jTrijis of April. 1st, 1908.the principal;Belgian &quot;revelations&quot; are those made by Col. Bern-, hard Schwertfeger. who .from February 1916 was in charge of the Brussels archives under the Military Governor. &apos;&apos; His two volumes &quot;UnverOffent-lichte Dokumente&quot;, tvo of a semi-official series, HZur. ISuropaischen Politik 1897-1914&quot; raid his &quot;Der Geistige Kampf um die Verletzung derBelgischen tfeutralitat&quot; constitute an amplification of the GermanGovernmentsk-  - &quot;&quot;&quot;       \y. .............!A summary.of. the whole \7hi.te Book is contained in a Reuter Copen-I hagen telegram which appeared in the British press on September 15th 1919&apos;.&apos;
Government1 s volume &quot;Belgische lii^enstucke 1905-1914&quot; which was published in 1915.K    An important section of the former hook con-eists of Belgian Ambassadorial reports from various capitals, among . which are those from &quot;Baron Grejrtdl from Berlin- which have been A&apos;iven the utmost prominence by the -German press as tending to show the pacific aims of German polity *    Unother . sect ion of the book is devoted to the reproduction of Belgian military memoranda showing that in the first years of the twentieth century the Belgian General Staff was counting on the violation&apos;&apos; of its neutrality from both the French and the German sides, but that in 1906 a change tdok place after &apos;.hi,ch it was from Germany alone that the&apos; menace was considered most likely to come, a transformation of policy which is ascribed exclusively to the baneful influence of King lidward VII.    2he &quot;revelations&quot; have proved the starting point for a tremendous renewed volume of &quot;aiinkreisungs&quot; propaganda on the part oT German publicists and agencies.     In this connection.it may be noted that in another volume of the series to which reference has been made Schwertfeger &amp;as dealt at considerable length and with a wealth of documentary detail with the policy of King Edward VII particularly in regard to Itrocoe,    This wo*k by Schwertfeger does not appear to have been given by any means the attention it deserves in this country, but its effect on neutral ae on German domestic opinion has been very    j, considerable.The additions!made during the past year %o our knowledge of Russian policy before the War have been very numerous.     In the first place the third French Yellow Book has given uocuments concerningtheH &apos;&quot;&quot;        &quot;&quot;&quot; 11These are subjected $o a very searching; criticism by Dr. Richard Grelling, Author of fJ&apos;Accuse&quot; in his volume of the same title, pub-lished by Payot, lausanhe.
the origin and developments of the &quot;Franco-Russian Alliance.     Then in the &quot;Deutsche Allgemeine  zeitung&quot; of December 19th 1918 (Abend-Ausgabe)i20th (Abedn-Ausgabe), 22nd (liorgen-Ausgabe), 23rd (Abend-Ausgabe) and 27th (Abend-Ausgabe), we are given translations of the text, as issued byLthe Soviet Government, of the correspondence of Count Benckendorf, kons. Isvolski and kons. Sasonoff concerning the much-discussed &quot;karinekonvention&quot; of 1912 to whioh it was hoped to obtain Great Bri-tain!s adherence.    These &quot;revelations&quot; were amplified later by a series of articles in the Soviet &quot;Pravda&quot; during Jiarch 1919, by the Soviet Foreign Office official Pokrowski whose principal documents and articles may be found conveniently summarised in the &quot;Deutsche All-gemeine  zeitung&quot; for kay 31st 1919.     A complete German translation together v/ith German versions of all other Soviet &quot;revelations&quot; con-c aiming Mtente policy prior to the liar is to be found in the German unite Book on the origin of the v/ar issued under the title &quot;Deutseh-land Schuldig.&quot;    The document to vhicii most attention lias been di-recte.&apos;i by the German or anti-British propagandists on the Continent as well as in America   is the report by Mods. Isvolski to Hons, sa-zonoff of April 22nd 1914, which is brought forward as tending to show that Sir Edward Grey was committed to tne principle of naval co-operation with Russia in the eveat of an outbreak of v/ar with Germany. From tiie French side an attempt has been made to counteract the ef-fect of these &quot;revelations&quot; by the publication of documents in the Paris periodical &quot;1&apos;Iurope Houvelle&quot; of September 20th, 1919, deal-ing particularly with lions. Poincare&apos;s relations with Austria and Serbia during 1912.KX____,0nSee the iTe^ York &quot;Hation&quot; for August 101.9.(xxConveniently summarised in the &quot;Times&quot; September 22nd 1919.
U &quot;jiOil the question of Russian military policy in the two or three years prior to the &apos;&quot;ar there have &quot;been several interesting &quot;revelations&quot; from the German eide.     The most important collee-tion is probably that contained in the book &quot;Russian-is Vorberei-tungen zum ueltkrieg&quot; by Professor Robert iioeniger who has in the main utilised the material found in Russian military archives at Warsaw, several of which he quotes in translation.-    His principal endeavour- has been to sho-; that from 1911 onwards Russia was seri-ously reckoning on war and making active preparations.     Considera ble prominence, is &quot;given, to alleged secret instructions to the ef-feet that when war appeared imminent Russian mobilisation should be carried on behind makebelieve diplomatic negotiations (Sche inv e rban dlvngenIt is not easy to submit Dr. iioeniger&apos;s &quot;Revelations&quot; to a critical test since he nowhere gives c-*3 origin-nals,, and very often, quotes documents only in oart. but as t* \ ne impression his book has produced, and the use to which it has been put by German propagandists there can be no doubt.     The same effect concerning Russian military preparations during the years -preceding the war is intended to be produced by the &quot;revelations&quot; of General von ko: Itke1s annual reviews of the military situation contained in the pamphlet !&apos;Hat der General Stab zum Krieg getrie-ben&quot;. , )V/hen we come to consider the question of Russian mobilisation in the critical twelve days in 1914   e find a mass of new material The question is for example dealt with at considerable length in the German \,hite Book to which reference has been made, which also uses the &quot;Sue horn] I now revelations.&quot;     There is also the book by Count Pourtales, &quot;Am Scheldewege zwischoa Kriegs und Prledeny&quot; which gives the Ambassador?s diary of events in Petrcgrad.     The questioa of mobilisation in general, which may here be opportunelymentioned,
t? fci 4(*-  o *&quot;mentioned.-.has-&quot;been-4ealt-^witlTla-Tiu2nerouB-jjer/gpaper and rev iev ar-ticles by Count liiontgelas, who was one of the members of the le?man commission appointed prior &quot;to the Peace Conference to Consider&apos; Lao matter of German guilt for $&apos;ne\ war.     His arguments may be found sum-marieed in the volumes &quot;DeutsehXahd Sehuldig4&quot;     Otherwise Montgslas&apos; principal contribution to the controversy is to be found in an ar-ticle in the new political review. &apos;!Die deuteche Nation&quot;   (summarised in the &quot;Mnchner Ifeueets ITachriehtfcn&quot; for 5th August 1919).     The German politicians who have written their war reminiscences, Bethmonn Eollveg,. von Jagow and helferrich In particular, have naturally de-voted a good deal of attention to the mobxlioation -question but they have not added to our knowledge more than the other documents men--tinned.     The attempt by Colonel Schwertfeger &amp;n the &quot;Deutsche Allge- -meine Zeitung&quot; for Hay 1st (Morgen-AnsgafreJ to use the French Briey commission report to justify the Frenoh point of view regarding French mobilisation and military preparations deserves to be mentioned here.Our knowledge of Anglo-German relations during the three or-four years preceding the war has been considerably amplified by a number of &quot;revelations&quot; and personal reminiscences published- during the past few months.     The most important concern the mission of Lord lialdane to Berlin in 1912.     On the German side this is fully described by Bethmann hollweg in the first volume of his &quot;Betrach-tungen zum Welt Kriege&quot; and again by Admiral von Tirpitz in the in-stalment of his &quot;Recollections&quot; in the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; for September 7th 1919*     A version from Lord Haldane1s point of view is published by himself in wLan4 &amp; Water&quot; September 25th and articles from him on the same subject are announced to be published in the ^Westminster Gazette.&quot;    The facts of the matter given by Mr. Harold Beghie.in his book the &quot;Vindication of Great Britain&quot; published in 1917 and those in the four documents first mentioned will enable historiansto
to write ae complete an account of Lord Kaldanefs negotiations as is possible until the publication of actual State Papers. The German case on the matter as so far presented does not, bow-ever, appear to call for any such thorough reply.the same, however, cannot be said for that class of. rcvcla-tory and argumentary documents whioh may be grouped generally under the heading &quot;Schul&amp;frage.&quot;    here we have had since nov.-ember 1916 a considerable number of apparently damaging digclo-sures.     Most of them have been gathered up in the German white Book on the origin of the war containing the memorandun of the German Committeeof Pour which undertook the work of examining the evidence on behalf of the German Peace Delegation.    &quot;The Commission though attacked in Germany by the JunkerPress&quot; seems nevertheless to have/a conscious attempt to assemble all the facts which a geared to them likely to clear Geiosa&amp;y   from t be charga of being morally guilty for the war.    Their work wae accomplished and their report published before the &quot;revelations&quot; concerning C-ount-Bercht-oid and. their attempt is therefore not so much to cast the blame on Austria as on Russia, to which they add this country and France as subsidiary accomplices.     It is not possible in the compass of this memorandum to give an adequate idea of the con-tents of the &quot;White Book;   a list of the principal documents and the subsequent newspaper and review articles which amplified it is given in the bibliographical Appendix.Russia&apos;s pre-war relations with the Balkan States, with Serbia in particular, are discussed in the volume by Boghitchewitc &quot;Kriegsursachen.*    The author, who was Serbian Minister at Berlin until the out-break of war, makes it his aims to prove that Russia supported and encouraged aggressive Serbian intentions and hisargument s
argumeats-^r^eiy^ in the German press.. On thesubject of Russian relations with the jmtente and Great.Britain : in particular an early hint of &quot;revelations&quot; was contained in Pro- . professor Schiemann!s accustion that Kerr von Bethmann Kollweg had. concealed, from the iiaperor documents, which,, he alleged,! tended to . show the way in which Great Birtain had bound herself to Russia. This charge and the controversy which followed, it are to be found in the German papers during March of this year..   In April.and May the Pravda &quot;revelations&quot; to which reference has been made were published and very widely commented on in the German press.   During these two months in fact exceptional efforts were made, particular-ly in the&apos;&quot;Deutsche Allgemeine  zeitung&quot; which is still evidently inspired by the German Foreign Office, to upset the whole 3Sntente-case against the Central Powers.     In this connection particular attention should be directed to the searching examination of pro-professor Cmanls book v/hich appeared in the &quot;Deutsche Allgemeine Zei-tung&quot; on Kay 15th as to that of the Blue, Orange, Yellow and Grey Books which commenced publication in the same paper on May 16th..&quot;Revelations&quot; since the armistice have very considerably en-larged our knowledge of the diplomatic action in the last few weeks before the outbreak of war*    The truth about the July 5th Council for example is now apparent.     At the Berne International Socialist Conference in February last the social Democrat Fritz Adler caused a sensation by disclosing the fact, wrhich he said he had intended to reveal at his trial, that at the beginning of July Count hoyos left Vienna for Berlin carrying a letter from the Jimperor Franz Joseph for the liaperor wilhelm.    The letter in question was pub-liehed in the review &quot;Deutsche Politik&quot; for Hay .16th.     shortly afterwards
afterwards there appeared Count Berohtold&apos;g accompanying memoran-tdum.     Our knowledge as to the attitude mid actions of that statesman n-as very considerably enlarged by the publication of a further Austrian Red Boole and disclosures in the &quot;Arbeiter-Zeitung&quot; and other Viennese papers showing that Count Berchtold, at the Council held at Vienna on July 7th 1914 urged the neces-eity for an immediate war - 1th Serbia, adding that he had re-ceiVed private assurances from Berlin.     His o$n statements and those &quot;revelations&quot; so far publishes did not in&apos; any v-ay upset the facts. -   The part Germany played is however somewhat m*re de-bat able.     The assurances Count Berchtold spoke of were preeav&amp;ibly those given on July 5th, that is to say before the conciliatory Serbian answer.     Subsequent to this in consequence of a recog^ nition of the fact that RUeeia would stand by Serbia and there-by a European war ensue the German statesmen appear to have rea-lised. the gravity of the situation and made some ostensible tempt to exercise moderation on Vienna.     So much could have been deduced from the i&amp;iperor yilhelm&apos;s letter to Bethmann Hollweg oifi Juts? 28th 1914 which was published in the &apos;!Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; on Juris 19th 1$19, but the publication in the last Aus-trian Red Book of the actual Berlin telegram seems to make sup-position certain.That there   as nevertheless a strong disposition in Germany in the weeks following the murder of the Archduke Ferdinand to support Austria-Hungary against Serbia and to risk the conse-quences is also beyond question.     This view was corroborated not only in the Lichnowksy memorandum but by the SzQgyenyi telegrams, disclose:- by the &quot;Journal des Debate&quot; and reproduced in the &quot;Deut-sche Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; for March 21st (Abend-Ausgabe) also by the so-called Lerchenfeld disclosures made by Kurt Eisner in December
t1918.     In regard to these last; however, it should he noted that the author of the documents discussed, Freiherr von Sohfln, assert-ed in July of this year that his report had been abbreviated and misrepresented;     The original complete text of his despatches to Count Kertling was published in the &quot;Lokal-Anzeiger&quot; for July 11th. The version of the political events leading to the outbreak of war as given in the books by von Jagow, Heifer rich and von Tirpitz should also be mentioned here.Concerning diplomatic negotiations1 and approaches to peace during the war there have been numerous &quot;revelations&quot; from the Ger-man side.    The earliest and one of the most important, was the dis-closure by Count Czernin in his speech of December last of his memorandum to the iSmperor Karl of April 1917 urging the immedi&amp;te conclusion of peace.     Later in the speech he showed how Germany prevented Austria from withdrawing from the war and subsequently amplified hie disclosures by the publication of his &quot;P.ecollections.&quot; The story of the Prince Sixte negotiations, in which Czernin was not concerned, but which were entered upon at about the same.time,, , as his letter to the liimperor, was told in the &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; for July 31st, &apos;&apos;Mch obtained it from the Paris &quot;Grande Revue&quot;. The most sensational series of &quot;Revelations&quot; of all in this class, however, was.that made in the German National Asseiiably on, July 25th when Kerr lirzberger disclosed the correspondence of the Munich Papal Nuncio, Mgr. Pacelli, concerning Great.Britain enquiry through her Mission at the Vatican as to Germany^ attitude on the Belgian question.     It was shown that, this alleged British &quot;Peace Offer&quot;, the nature of which was subsequently revealed from the British side in the offfcial unite Paper was rendered in effective by the atti-tude of kichaelis.   Similar &quot;revelations&quot; were made by the MinisterPresident
President-Bauer&quot;tending -to incriminate the German General Staff in the attempt to wreck the &quot;p*eace offers&quot; of the summer of 1917 and on July 31st &quot;Vorw&amp;rts&quot; published a memorandum hy General Ludendorf of September 14th 1917 claiming, among other things, annexations and the military occupation of Belgium for a term of years.     An interesting side-light on the attitude of von J&amp;TChl-mann - it is noteworthy that WLu statesman has not yet broken silence - was provided by the extracts from Scheidemann1s diary whioh- appeared in &quot;Vorwarts&quot; for August 2nd, 1919.     In spite of several rejoinders, in particular from Kichaelis (&quot;T gl:Lsohe Rundschau&quot; July 27th, 1919) and also in ludendorf!s defence of himself contained in his book, there can be doubt that the &quot;leve-lations&quot; of Erzberger and Bauer strengthened their posiv-ion and threw lasting discredit .on the old regime,.    To complete this section of the memorandum it may be remarked that the story of the J&amp;ensdorff - Smuts negotiations has been told by Count Vodel in the &quot;Hamburger NachrichtenB and of the Count Tarring negotiations w.lth the Belgian Government by the &quot;Journal de Geneve&quot; for 8th, 9th and . 10th August.1919.11. From the point of view of practical politics it would appearthafc the most important &quot;revelations&quot; next to those concerning the,&quot;Schuldfrage&quot; are those relating to the armistice of November 11th 1918.     For since that event the parties of the Right in Germany have been attempting to undermine the position of the Government by asserting that the men who compose it were primarily responsible for the breakdown of the German Army.    Ludendorf him-self makes the same attempt in his book and a small army of pro-pagandists inspired by him and headed by his intimate colleague, Col. Bauer, have been attempting to popularise the same view.   Wit! the object of counteracting this propaganda the German Governmentin
&apos; &apos;.   *      - y ^, ... &apos; &apos;1 &apos; 350iI* 14 -in August last permitted the publication of a white Book contain -ing all the principal documents, concerning the armistice, by whieh it was endeavoured to shov&apos; that, it was Ludendorf who failed andwho was the direct and urgent .instigator of the &quot;ueace offer!?&apos;. ......      , -;   .&apos; .: !&apos;;&quot;- .&apos; -     -:?f. rof October 4th.    Ludendorfls counter-charge that he would nothave needed to press for this had. the, Government kept him properlysupplied and done its part in, maintaining tne moral of the countryis shorn to rest&apos; on very insecure foundations.    The breakdownwas essentially a military, breakdown and the demonstration ofthis fact by means of an impartial selection of documents wouldappear to be an historical task of the, highest practical order.
