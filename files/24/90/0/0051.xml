Circulated by the Secretary of State for India.4JLThe Future of Cyprus.I do not wish to oiler any opinion about the strategical considerations which must affect the position as to the future of Cyprus, but there is a considerable population of Turks upon the island, and I do not understand that the principle of self-determination would justify handing these gentle-men over to their enemies the Greeks.It is, however, a small matter compared with the treatment which is sometimes contemplated of the Turkish populations of Adrianople, Con-stantinople or Smyrna, and I would welcome the ill-treatment of the Turks in Cyprus if by any chance it rescued the Turks. of Smyrna from the Greeks.May I take this opportunity of calling attention to some of the remarks recently made on the subject of Smyrna in the memorandum circulated by the Secretary of State for War ? Unless the Treaty of Peace with Turkey now is satisfactory from the Mohammedan point of view, we shall come out of the war without many friends left from Egypt to China. It was always, hoped that even if we treated Turkey with a ferocity meted out to no other of our enemies, at least our attitude would not be described as anti-Mohammedan because of the bond of union between us and the Shereefian family which we had brought into prominence by our efforts during the war. Our agreements with France have permanently estranged this family. It is quite likely that they will make arrangements with Turkey, and it becomes more important than ever to consider the British position vis-a-vis Mohammedans, not only because of our political interests, but because, as the War Office paper pointed out, it will have a very material effect upon our military expenditure in peace time. It had always seemed to me that before the war we allowed the Turks to fall into the hands of Germany when we had many an opportunity of making friends of them. All the evidence points to a permanent estrangement between Germany and Turkey and to the fact that all parties in Turkey are looking for friends, [f we can exact the proper punishment from those who misled Turkey into the war and then help Turkish Turkey to restoration, we shall not only have done the right thing but have considered our own interests.These considerations may at first sight appear irrelevant, but if this policy could be pursued, and if Cyprus could be used to get us out of some of our entanglements which conflict with it, I would gladly sacrifice i the Turks of Cyprus. Taken alone, however, the Cyprus proposition seems to me to be unjustifiable, and it is all the more unjustifiable if it is thought that by considering the Turks in Cyprus we can be excused for injustice to Turks in other parts of Europe or Asia.15th October 1919.E.
