This document is the property of Els Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,LEAGUE   0 I   NAT 10, N- 3. BRITISH ORGANISATION.(Note &quot;by the Secretary)The British Empire, Prance and Itsly have now rstified the Tresty of Peace.     If Itsly&apos;s ratification,, which is subject to Parliamentary confirmation, is accepted (a point on which I have been informed privstely thet the French Government feels some doubts) the first proces verbal of the deposit of ratifications may take piece any day.     It appears from todsy&apos;s telegram from the Peace Conference that Mr,Polk is asking  resident Wilson to call a meeting of the Council of the League which is to take piece within a fortnight of the coming into force of the Treaty of Peace for the purpose of settling certain questions connected with the Saar and possibly Danzig.     This will only be a formal.meeting, but I am informed b  Sir Eric Lrummond that farther meetings of the Council of the League may be expected to take place in Europe, while the Assembly is likely to be convened in Washington early in 1920.The question therefore arises for early consideration as to what should be the British organisation in connection with the League of Nations.The first question which the War Cabinet will have to decide would seem to be who the British representative is to be.The alternative woo/id appear to lie between the selection of a permanent representative, or the selection of Ministers ad hoc to represent the British Empire at particular meetings.    A third variant, which is I understand the plan which the French intend to adopt, would be to select a permanent representative but to exercise a power of substitution at the CouncilSECRET C-;T. 8369
9 r&apos; ;)Council according to the subject to he discussed, since withtechnicel questions under consideretion it might he difficultalwaysfor the same representative/to state the British case adequately.The next question for consideration is the department or departments with whioh the League is to correspond.     I have discussed the matter with Sir Eric Lrummond end his view is that the most convenient procedure would he for the Leaguo to heve the right to correspond direct with any department on a question of departmental detail, but even so, some department will have to undertake,the correspondence on larger questions of policy and on matters relating to meetings of the Council and the Assembly.     This department v/ould either have to be the Foreign Office or the Secretariat of the Cabinet, or some new department.     Tho V/ar provided ample precedents for somo such procedure.     The Supreme War Council, for example, dealt with all questions of detail directly with the General Staff but on larger questions of policy addressed its communications through the Secretary of the War Cabinet to the Prime Minister. The same applied to tho Supreme Economic Council and the Allied Maritime Transport Council.     The lleval Council, however dealt only with the Admiralty who themselves brought to the Cabinet such questions as required Cabinet authority.The procedure proposed by Sir l;;ric Drummond appears to be a reasonable one.     Its corollary would seem to be the designation of an, official in each department to deal with League of Nations questions   and the formation, of an Inter-departmental Committee for the purpose of co-ordinating League of Nations questions.     The Chairman of this Inter-departmental Committee would presumably be the British repros-entstive on the Council of the League if it is decided to appoint a permanent member, but it would be necessary to select a Vice Chairman to provide for the case of his absence at the seat of the League.     The Secretariat of the Inter-departmental Committee would naturally be in the department to whichcommunications
8, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, 17th October, 1919.*) H Ocommunications on questions of policy are addressed which would then provide the focus of all British relations with tho League of Nations.     Heads of a draft scheme on the above lines ere attached as a basis for consideration. (Aopendix).When the Cabinet has formed its own decision on this question it would appear desirable to communicate their views to the self-governing Dominions and India, both in regard to the selection of the British representative on tho Council and to their possible representation on the Inter-departmental Committee.i(signed) M.P.A.Hankey.Secretary, War Cabinet.

Government departments with the League of Nations.Should tho Secretariat of the War Cabinet be selected as the central department to which communications.on Questions of policy, etc., ere to be addressed, an increase of staff will be necessary.    At the outset it would be proposed to limit this to one officer, one superintending clork and one typist.     It is almost certain, however,, that an increase in staff would become necessary ao the work developed, and more especially after the League has established its permanent seat, when the question of a permanent British Office at the seat of the League may arise.     Possibly the Dominions end India might evontually consent to share&apos; in the staffing of . this Branch las part of the development of the Imperial Cabinet system, but. this is a question which would probably have to be postponed until the Conference on Imperial relations meets.
