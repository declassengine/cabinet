(THIS DOOUI^T r:&quot;TiL PRd^BRTY OF HIS.&apos; BBITirlfllO IiLlJ^TY1 3 CrQYaRNj-BffT) *SECRET, ,GoTQ-83.35.     I W A.-R-    (?,&apos;.&amp;, B I K B. T.CENOTAPH IK- Y/HITEHALL. * 11 - ....... I., i     11      ..........i.....i.Memorandum by the Eirst Commissioner of Works,-With reference to my memorandum of the 23rd July last (G.T.7.784) on which the&apos; War Cabinet decided that a permanent replica of the temporary Cenotaph in Whitehall should be-pro-ceeded&apos; with, I have been in communication with Sir Edwin Lutyarns and it is estimated&apos; that the cost of the permanent Memorial will be  10,00b including the decorative work for the wreaths, standards, etc*, but excluding any exceptional difficulties that may&quot;be found bb to foundations.      The weight of the Iviemcrial will be approximately 120 tons*.     Sir Edwin Lutysns will not accept any fee in connection with the designing or erection of the existing or the pemanent structure.-If the Cabinet approve, I propose to prooeed immediately with the work after obtaining the approval of Parliament for the expenditure by a Supplementary Estimate, which I ask .for authority to introduce at the earliest possible date.     As it will be necessary owing to the advent of winter to,remove the existing., temporary structure- at an early date, it is most desirable&apos; that early approval for the carrying out di.the work should he given, as the new work could be commenced immediately the temporary structure&apos; is remdved and a double expenditure on the erection of screens would thus be saved,     The Chancellor of the Exchequer informs me thai he ma.ses no. objection to the expenditure.I,.have received many suggestions for the -insertion&apos;, of an Inscription of a Christian nature updn the permanent-Memorials Copies of-these -suggestions are attached and it will/seen that two have been received from the Lord Bishop of 7/Inchester acting-for the Archbishop of Canterbury^     In this connection I should like to mention that 5n the 29th July, lit. Bonar Law explained, in reply to a question addressed to hiirl(by tlsdount Wolmei1 in the House of Commons, inquiring, whether ih future a Christian design would be adopted in national Memorials to fallen soldiers1 ahd sailors, that the temporary structure was erected in order that, on the- day of the Peace procession, the Nation should visibly express the great debt which it owes to those v;ho   from all parts of the Empire irrespective&quot; of their religions creeds, had made the supreme sacrifice. -   In reply, to a similar question in the House by Major&apos;Birchall on the 13th August last, I replied that any suggestions as to the form of. the inscription on the perma-nent memorial should receive the careful cousideration of the Government;Apparently there is a considerable body of opinion in the Country in favour of a Christian inscription upon the monument, but whether or-not such an inscription should be placed upon-it is a matter on which I feel opinions widely differ.
I hove, already pointed out to the Bishop   of Winchester that the permanent memorial cannot be ro arded as being similar to a monument placed in one of our Cathedrals, as it is incumbent upon His Lia.5esty:,s Government in: deciding what, if any, inscription, in addition to that 1 To the Glorious Dead&apos; should be placed.on the permanent structure, to  uard aftainst giving offence to the many non-Christian nations of the - Empire who also contributed to a lsr-fce extent to tie&quot;Armies of His Majesty engaged in the recent conflict.I may add that I have consulted Sir Edwin Lutyens on the subject, end he lo strongly opposed to-making any alteration in the design or inscription as he is of opinion that it would detract from the.appearance and simplicity of his monument if a large additional amount of lettering were inscribed upon it.I consider that the placing of flowers, memorial wreaths, etc., at.all times on the Cenotaph should be discountenanced and the brea^,:.between the .demolition of the temporary Memorial and tho erection o. the permanent structure should make suoh a policy, comparatively speaking, easy.Amass of decaying flowers&apos;needs almost dai.y attention besides tending to attract crowds in a. crowded thoraughfare.I suggest that permission to lay &quot;Jloral tributes be limited to one or perhaps, two days in&quot;the year, say, the 19th July, the d-te ox the Peaoe Procession and some other day suoh as Easter Monday.(Signed)     ALFRED MOM),15th October,.1919,
