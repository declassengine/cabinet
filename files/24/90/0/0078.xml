Memorandum *y the President of the Board of Trade *lt EMPLOYMENT OF ALIENS IN MERCHANT SHIPS.The following olauso was inserted in the Aliens Restriction Bill in Committee:*5.     &quot;No Alien shall act as master, ohief officer or chief engineer of a British Merchant ship registered in the United Kingdom except in the case of a ship employed entirely in trade between parts of the world outs ids the British Empire&quot;*Ideutenanl^ooiDander Kenworthy has given not ire to move amendments whieh will mates the clause read as followsnNo Alien shall act as master, offioer, or enginetr or as ^member of a crew of a Brlilsn merchant sEip   &apos;&quot; r^gleiered in the Uhlifcd Kingdom except in the caso of a ship employed entirely in trade between parts of the world out of the British Empire; provided        \ that for a period of three years from the date &apos;6f the&apos; fasm^oT^is&apos; f^lS^^^^mm^^ of  55     . crew^f * a&apos;TrTtlW^eTcEani sHpre^stefeu&quot; in ine   r&quot;&quot;Vv united Kingdom should no^rltish seafarers bepThe Bill as it stands prohibits the employment tf an alien as master, ohief officer or chief engineer, while the amende ment extends the prohibition to the other officers and engineers and to all members of the crew,, but allows a certain/   f amount tf latitude during the first three years.Tho reasons for these proposals are the prevailing foel*J ing^against foreigners, the idea that it is not safe to allow foreigners to be in charge of a British ship in time ef war, and the desire to protect officers and men from foreign competition, especially at a time when there is a considerable amount of unemployment amongst officers and .. seamen owing to demobilisation.The preposal to prevent foreigners from serving as members of the orew of British ships is much moreserlousr , than the proposal to rule out foreign, ofric^for &quot;the reason tha t wecould/
9 0 1 d b i could run the ships without the foreign officers, hut cannot afford, at any rate at present, to do without the foreign seamen and firemen..    In 1891, the percentage of foreigners on British ships was 13,8 (23,884 out of 172,773).     In 1901 it was 17.4 (32,614 out of 186,636).   In 1911 it was again 13.8 (28,729 out of 208,214).The 1911 figures are tho last census figures that we have&apos;.In 1918-19, 15.8 of the deck department and 23.1 of the engineers department were &quot;born in foreign countries.The fact is that whether we like it&apos;*r not our merchant ships do depend to a marked extent on foreign seamen, and to cut off that supply ef foreign labour, oven with the three years safeguard proposed by Lieutenant-Commander Kenworthy would mean that a number of ships would be held up.The exclusion of all foreign seamen from British ships would moreover raise the question,of reprisals.    In 1918-1919 over iQfc tf the officers and men tn Amarloan ships, counting repeated shipments, were British, (of 256,000 engagements 27,000 were by Britishers) and it would not be a good service to British offloors and seamen to cause the question of excluding them from foreign ships to be taken up in an aotire form.I therefore submit that this particular amendment should bo resisted at all costs. It is really unreasonable for us, if we di a large part of the carrying trade of the world, to refuse te allow some foreigners to serve in cur ships.The proposal to exclide the foreign officer is, I think, also bad in principle, but not so dangerous as the other.In 1918-19 of 5,951 masters, 82 or 14$ were born in foreign countries, and an analysis shows that 51 out of these 82 were foreign subjects.    The effect of the Bill therefore would be.to remove 51 men out of a total of 5,951.In 1918-19 the total number of mates was 10,480 and cf these 229, or 2.2$ were born in foreign countries.Of 17,077 engineers, 313 or 1.8^ were born in foreign countries.These figures are cenfirmod by the numbor of certificates issued to foreign masters, mates and engineers by the Board of Trade.Certificates issued (Masters, Mates and Engineers).Yearly average.

engineers have to bo nationals.    (In the United States the rule is relaxed in practice.)    In Denmark they have to be nationals if the vessel touches at Irnish ports.    In Sweden the master and Officers must be Sweden, but foreigners are allov/ed to be employed as engineers for the present.    In Norway the master must be Norwegian, but there is no restriction on officers or engineers.    In Italy the master and two-thirds of the crew must be nationals.    In Belgium and the Netherlands there&apos; is no restriction.The extent to which British officers are employed on foreign ships is not known,, but H is a common tnimfor British engineers to be employed on ships built in British yards for foreign owners,, and a good number of British engineers still find regular employment on foreign ships * To exclude all foreign officers from British ships will give further impetus to the movement already in progress for excluding non-nationals from foreign slaps..    It is possible, if not probable, that British officers as a body would lose mcvs than they would gain.&apos;   We are not likely to have the same proportion of the worlds tonnage as we had before the war, and if we exclude foreign officers from our ships we cannot complain if those countries which still allow British officers to serve on their ships follow our example..It is urged that, it is necessary for defence reasons that at least the Master, and possibly also the chief officer, - should always be British, but during the war the Admiralty were as a matter of fact able to take such steps as were necessary to exclude foreign officers, and, so far as the Board of Trade are aware, these measures were effective.I personally doubt whether the permanent exclusion of all foreign masters is really necessary, but the Admiralty consider the Master should always be British and I defer to their opinion,I think however that the exclusion of other officers is unnecessary and undesirable, and submit that the facts and arguments set out above should be put before the House on the Report stage of the Bill.    If the House is clearly in favour of excluding the foreign officer, the point is hot of sufficient practical importance to make it worth while risking a defeat.    The clause in the Bill would, however, need a number of amendments to make it workable, and it would be better to renlace it by a clause forbidding after a certain date the issue of any certificate as master, mate or engineer of a British ship, or as skipoer or second1 hand of a rishing vessel to a. foreigner.    fais would be easy to enforce and would safeguard the position of those f or signers;., who obtained their certificates in good faith under the present system.    In any case the position of these officers, especially those who served during the war, must be safeguarded.
(.; a11.   Pilotage Cert If 1 cates.Clause 4 of the Bill reads as follows:-&quot;No alien shall hold a pilotage certificate for any port In the United kingdom&quot;.Pilotage certificates are granted after examination by a Pilotage authority to the master or mate of a ship, relieving him from the obligation to employ the services of a licensed pilot where, but for the certificate, he would be required to do so.    Under Section 73 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1906, the grant of pilotage certificates was confined for the future to British subjects,     The French Government pointed out that this conflicted with treaty rights under which they were entitled to national treatment.    An Anglc-frenbh Commission was thereupon set up, which arrived at a compromise to which effect was given in Section 24 of the Pilotage Act, 1913.Under this Section provision is made (1) for the renewal of pilotage certificates granted before the first of June, 1906, to an alien master or mate:   (2) for the granting of fresh certify oates in cases where an alien master or mate shews to the satis*-faction of the Board of Trade that he is a master or mate of a ship which is of substantially the same class and trading re- . gularly between the same ports as a foreign ship which on the first of. June, 1906, was exempt.from the obligation of carrying a licensed pilot or had habitually been piloted by a master sr mate of a ship who held a pilotage certificate.    In such cases the Board of Trade&quot;may authorise a master *r mate to apply to a Pilotage Authority for a pilotage &quot;certificate.     It will be seen, therefore, that no new pilotage certificates can be granted to an alien without the express authority of the Board of Trade,Further, the section provides that if the Admiralty at any . time consider on the grounds of public safety that these provisions should not be applicable with respect to any pilotage district or part of a district they may make an Order excluding that district or part of a district from the operation of those provisions, Such Orders have been made by the Admiralty in a considerable nunber of cases, and the Board of Trade have arranged with the Admiralty that they will not authorise any alien to apply for a pilotage certificate without first consulting the Admiralty   -and giving them an opportunity of exercising their veto by the issue of an Order, ;^f a total of 2,500 pilotage certificates in force, only 61 were helc; by aliens in 1914, and these have now been reduced to 24, none of these being enemy aliens,ii     I submit that the interests of national safety are fully secured by the existing provisions and that it is most undesirable that Clause 4 of the Bill nhould be allowed to stand since it directly contravenes the agreement arrived at-between this Country and our present ally France at so recent a date.A.
