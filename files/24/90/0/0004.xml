There is great ignorance among the public as to what aotually took plaoe, and the feeling prevails that in some way the Government gave way at a time when they had the unqualified support of the nation.   The railwayiaen themselves are beginning to realise that they obtained nothing by the strike, and of course the leaders are undor no illusions.* *The new rqle of mediator does not fit Mr. Robert Williams, who has written a characteristic letter to the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; advocating the establishment of a &quot;General Staff&quot; for Labour, He and others of his persuasion are already preparing for the next big strike, and their plan is to uso the Co-oporative Societies to give free food to the strikers while denying it to all others.It is believed that Mrt Robert&apos; Smillie has his own plans for a Coal Strike, probably when he has information that the &apos; stocks of coal are dangerously low.   The Coal Miners, howerer, have no great reserve of funds.The Soviet Government interpreted the Prime Ministers statement, that the Government would fight the Railway Strike with all the resources at its disposal, to mean &quot;executions, beating with gun-butts, prison, eviction from houses, and the other means employed by Capitalists,&quot; which are the Communists1 own weapons against those who happen to disagree with them.The suggestion is made that any amendments to the Trades Union Act should include one making a strike illegal until a ballot has been taken.The London Workers Committee is being reconstituted, with David Ramsey, who recently underwent a term of imprisonment for making a revolutionary speech, as organiser.
TK3 RAILWAY STRIKE AND AFTERThe extremists among the Labour Leaders are now concentrating&apos;their attention on the formation of what they call a &quot;General Staff&quot; for. Labour.;   They are realising to the fall that they were badly beaten by the Government through their own miscalculations.   The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; has now taken up the idea of the General Staff - an idea which was invented by tho British Socialist Party and advocated in &quot;The Call.&quot;   In an article in 1 te &quot;Daily Herald&quot; of October 7th, W. Mellor, % member of. the Independent Labour Party, says that . &quot;such a General Staff need have no over-riding Executive Authority, but it most certainly should be a central storehouse to; which all Trades Unions can resort .... Had this existed the nine days1 strike might well have been different,&quot;   In the issue of October 8th,   it is pointed.out that the Staff.may be employed in the fight for the nationalisation of the mines.The first step in this scheme.appears already to have been taken, for a United Advisory Council of Trades Unionists and Co-operators, with Mr. 0.??. Bowerman, M.P., and Mr. A, Y/hitehead as Joint secretaries, has already been formed.   Besides the National&apos; Council, there are several local: Councils in existence.   The London Council is presided over by Mr.- T. Naylor, Secretary of the London Society of Compositors and one of the fourteen mediators.   A private meeting of thi3 Council was held on October 4th, under the auspices of the National Union of Railwayman.   The Chairman impressed;. upon the delegates the necessity for absolute secrecy.i- The following resolution was passed...&quot;That/
M     g    M&quot;That tills Conference appoints deputations      4 &quot;to meet local Co-operative Societies, in order &quot;that arrangements may be made so that food &quot;coupons will he honoured when presented by &quot;necessitous persons.&quot;Extracts were made from speeches at this meeting.Mr. Bramley said:nA communication has been sent throughout the &quot;country, instructing all Trade Unionists working &quot;for the Co-operative Societies to oontinue forking in the event of a general strike, in order &quot;to limit the sufferings of our own people.   I hope &quot;we shall, at a later date, hold up the supplies &quot;destined for the poople we are striking against...&quot;Mr^Williams said:&quot;Members of the Transport Workers will be &quot;allowed to handle foodstuffs intended for j?rade - &quot;Unionists only ..... If this is done it will take &quot;more than one Government to break us, especially &quot;if we have four million co-operators behind us.&quot;Another speaker said:&apos; ,TWe should havo bad the Advisory Council years &quot;ago, and then we should not have been in the &quot;position in which we find ourselves to-day.   The &quot;Government are miles in front of us with their Organisation.&quot;In closing the meeting, Mr, Foot, Secretary of the London District Council of the National Union of Railway men, impressed upon the delegates the necessity for silence, adding, &quot;If this information gets outside our enemy will use it against us.&quot;This is a matter which ought to engage the early attention of the War Cabinet Committee.   The plan is that in any large strike the strikers will be able to count upon free food, to be charged against the Trade Union funds, while tho Co-operative Society would decline to supply any non-striker.   Stocks of food would be accumulated in anticipation, and would be replenished by the Transport Y/orkers, even if they were on strike at the time.   To frustrate the plan it would be necessary to have power to commandeer all stocks of food, including those/
3    Mthose of tho Oo-oporators. It will not he forgotten that the Soviet Government in Russia has practically been kept alive by the Co-operative Movement.Another danger is the lov/ness of the stocks of coa]., espocially at the beginning of the winter.   This is very likely to be exploited bv Mr. Srnillie, and steps ought to be taken to provide against it.   If a strike were to be declared the dock labourers in America would probably refuse to handle coal which was intended to break the strike, but it might be possible to ship largo stocks of coal to some little used port like Hewhaven, and accumulate it in a sufficient quantity which could be transferred by eoastwiso traffic to any place where it might be most wanted,   The advantage would be that this could not be described as &quot;blackleg coal,&quot;The railwayman returned to work on Monday and Tuesday, and there has, on the whole, been remarkably little friction.   Perhaps the majority of them still believe that thoy have won a victory, though in Scotland they are beginning to remark that while everyone is talking of victory they cannot see what,they have achieved by striking.-* The general publio,; on the other hand, seem to think that the Government olitibed, down; they never.quite understood the question at issue,: in spite of the explanations that wore published during the strugglo. They are not, however, inclined to blame the Government ovonauch, seeing that the large towns were successfully fed.   There is universal admiration on both sides of the organisation for the supply and transport of food.It is a great pity that the papers were allowed to exploit the little handful of persons of high social standing who volunteered their services, seeing that thevast/
vast majority of -the volunteers belonged to the artisan and lower middle class.   (These newspaper paragraphs gavefl occasion to Mr, Robert Williams to sneer at the &quot;loafers from the Piccadilly Clubs,1&apos; and to assert that &quot;few, if any  workers blacklegged upon their fellow workers.&quot;There is no love lost between Mr. Tliomas and Mr. Robert Williams, and the latter feels so uncomfortable in the role of mediator that he has written an apologia to the &quot;Daily Herald1&apos; of October 8th quite in his om style.   His points are that industrial aotion in the future must assume a class character; that the tax payers&apos; money, which includes that of the working class, will bo used by the Government in favour of the upper class; that a &quot;General Staff of Labour&quot; must immediately bo formed.   The object of the article is to rehabilitate himself with his fellow extremists, for he says, &quot;Wo of the Transport Workers1 Iteration were willing and anxious to swing into line, except &quot; hat it was not so much our duty as the duty of the entire Trade Union Movomont.&quot;THE &quot;VALUE OF THE) BALLOT IS TRADE PKIOflSI have already referred to the fact that a strike is less likely to occur when a ballot is taken than when supreme power is vested in an Executive,   The present, therefore, might be a suitable time for Labour Members of Parliament to introduce an amendment to the Trades Union Act, many clauses of whioh are obsolete and render negligible the power of the individual.   If through legislation a ballot were made an essential preliminary to any strike, thero appears little doubt that great stabilisation of industry would ensue.   The law would often be disobeyed, but the &quot;lightning strike&quot; on a large scale would be rare. .    GNATIONALISATION/
NATIONALISATION Og THE COAL MIKES11; has been reported from more than one souroe that Mr, Smillia1,, reason for not allowing the miners to participate in the railway strike was his desire to conserve his funds and fo rocs for the nationalisation issue.Extensive propaganda is &quot;being conducted by Labour organisations.   In the County.of Itarham alone, twenty mass meetings were.held on September 27th, &amp;t which various Labour M,P3. and Miners1 officials spoke.   In o&amp;oh case, resolutions in favour of nationalisation were passed. ,PARUAMTAPY CANDIDATE Of HE AfeXOAMATED SOCIETY OF EHGIKEBRS The Amalgamated Society of Engineers has Just, completed a ballot for candidates to represent it in Parliament.   Nineteen were selected, of whom Tom Mann, J.T. Brcr;,nlie and David Kirkwood headed the poll.   The number of votes ranges from nearly 20,000 in the case of Tom M,\nn, to 10,000 for the last successful candidate on the list.It&apos;will be remembered that Tom M-nn also headed the preliminary voting for the secretaryship of this society.THE FEELIHCr AMONGST EX-SERVICE MEMInterest this week has centred in the altitude of discharged men towards the railway strikers.   On thewhole, this has at no time given cause for anxiety, while,in some distriots, notably in South Wales, the men pledgedthemselves to oppose any coercion of the community.   TheNational federation of Discharged and Demobilised sailors and Soldiers adopted, officially, a neutral attitude, withthe proviso that MZ&quot; Beserve men should not respond toa.call.to rejoin the Colours in the event of industrial - tiiup^te/
dispute.Friction may arise in the case of those discharged men who volunteered for service during the strike.THS INDEPENDENT LABOUR PARTYThis organisation has started a winter campaign by a series of meetings in memory of Keir Her die.   On September 20th, some 0,000 people attended a meeting in Glasgow and there was an overflow gathering 6f 1500. Councillor P,.7. Dollan, Mr. Suillie and S. Satyamurti wore amongst the speakers; the last named delivered a violent attack upon itaitish rule in ImUa, v/hioh was enthusiastically received by hie audience.During the week many Independent Labour Party meeting had to be curtailed or 2.bandoned owing to the fact that the officials were engaged in supporting the railwaymen,LONDON WORKERS COMMITTEEI have previously reported that a movement is on foot to co-ordinate the activities of the various London V/6x*kera Committee^ branches.   On September 27th a conference was held in the Memorial Hall, Farringdon Street, at which about 150 delegates were present. Owing to the late arrival of Tom M^nn, Walter Ponder took the chair and explained that the conference had been called to reorganise the London Workers Committee on lines which would permit the term &quot;Direct Action&quot; to be carried out to the letter.   He went on to advocate national organisation as a preliminary to a general strike.   Arthur MacManua emphasised the present inability of the various Trade Unions to call a general strike and urged the adoption of the methods followed by the Industrial Workers of the World.A/
A committee, consisting of Tom Mann, David Ramsey and Doy, Borrow, Parry, Lyon and Welsh, was elected under the title of &quot;The London Workers1 Mid Shop Stewards .;. Committee,&quot;: , ,   Ranney was appointed organiser at a salary of  5 per week, and it was decided to divide the London district into four sections, North,South, Bart and West. ^Resolutions.supporting the strikes of policemen and-railwaymen were passed.THEOUPBAM LABOUR PARTY, , This section of the Lrbour Party, which claims to he &quot;The Clearing; House of all &quot;branches of the Labour and Socialist movement in the Clapham Parliamentary Division ::i , of W^ndsworth,&quot; has lately come into prominence by reason of it3 revolutionary tendencies.   The moving spirit is Dr. McGregor Reid, who has for some years associated :. himself with subversive movements in the Police force, ;:  and who instigated the recent attaok on the Majestic Cinema.at Clapham when the anti-Bolshevik film was being shown. , ..There is. considerable: opposition to this extremist party in the Clapham district, chiefly on the part of ,.,  ex-sold,iers. -&apos;:u..r^,,NATIONAL kvdGlM&amp; UNION 0? labour the Quarterly Report and&apos; Balance Sheet of the National Amalgamated Union of Labour shows for this quarter an increase in membership of 5,960, making the total 154,036.   The credit of the Union stands at  71,353. 14. ll&quot;ld. as against  63,426. 0. 8d. for the preceding quarter.As Is the case in most of the organisations of unskilled labourers, the Notional Amalgamated Union of Labour supports constitutional measures, and the comments of/
M   3 *&quot;*of the General Secretary, Mr. J.N. Boll, J.P., on&quot;Bolshevism and Direct Action&quot; bear quotation:&quot;In common with other Unions, we have not been &quot;ablo to escape tho offsets of the prevalent unrest. &quot;Had the movement for &quot;Direct Action&quot; of what is &quot;called &quot;The Triple Alliance&quot; come to a head, a &quot;considerable number of Transport Workers, who are &quot;members of our Union, would have been called upon &quot;to cCme to a decision on a very serious question, &quot;viz., whether, when a section of the community &quot;finds itself, through its own futility, in a &quot;minority at a General Election, it may then prooeed &quot;to coerce tho community into obedience to that &quot;minority*s decision by bringing the industries of &quot;tho country to a standstill, in other words, by &quot;promoting a general strike in certain vital &quot;trades.   If this course of action had to be &quot;endorsed, then there must be an end of all &quot;Parliamentary Government, and any body of citizens &quot;*tfio failed to secure a majority for their views &quot;at an election would be at liberty to adopt &quot;similar action to compel the majority of the &quot;nation to adopt the policy which they, the minority, &quot;favour.   I hardly think that such a policy will &quot;commend itself to the members of the National &quot;Aj;vJLgamated Union of Labour.&quot;A.B. MANDBKTho General Secretary of the National Union of ex-Service Men, A.E. mm&amp;er, is by far,the most extreme of the more important leaders of ex-Service men.   His attitude towards the railway strikers was summed up in his reply to tho National Federation of Discharged and Demobilized Sailors and Soldiers:   &quot;Neutrality be daisned.&quot;    As his organisation is now stated to consist of 68 branches, with 40 more in process of formation, his activities merit attention.He contributes to the October issue of &quot;The New World&quot; (the organ of the Union) an article on &quot;Back Pay - How to get it,&quot; in which he reiterates the demand for the socialisation of the land.   Mander is probably the author of &quot;An open letter to the men who mn the war -at Downing Street,&quot; in which he exposes sarcastically the alleged ill-treatment meted out to discharged men. 9&quot;THE/
.  . -    ii- 9 -&quot;THE WORKER&quot;The current issue of this paper, whioh is the organ of the Workers1 Committees of Scotland, was particularly vituperative in character.   The editor is John S. Clarke, wiiose literary style may he jtidged from the following excerpt:&quot;The Railwaymen are pitting themselves against &quot;the most odious,, cowardly and treacherous Government &quot;that is now, and probably ever has been, on the face &quot;of the earth.   It is composed of some of the &quot;wildest and most reckless liars imaginable.   They &quot;wriggled or 1 wangled1 their way to power by &quot;adopting the arts and tactics of the most abandoned &quot;of unprincipled charlatans.   Think of the broken &quot;pledges; the inhuman treatment of the soldiers; &quot;tho unblushing falsehoods on the Russian situation, &quot;from the suppression of the Prinkipo affair right &quot;up to the latest, foulest and most despicable lie /of all - the denial of Bullit*s assertions. &quot;Remember the secret documents On strike-breaking &quot;to the Army officials and on riots - in short, &quot;look at the personnel itself for Justification &quot;of the assertion contained in the first sentence &quot;above..........&quot;&quot;The only logical reply to this kind of &quot;villainy is the reply the Railwaymen have made. &quot;But it is not enough1.   The whole of organised &quot;Labour must back up the Railwaymen,   Organised &quot;Labour must shift this crowd of clumsy and brazen-, &quot;faced liars out of the position of power t ey have&apos; &quot;usurped, and which they manipulate to the advantage &quot;of the Capitalist Class.   There are signs that &quot;this will oe done.   The Triple Alliance must act &quot;as a whole.   They must not let individual sections &quot;be weakened.   Battalions must not be sacrificed &quot;one at a time.   Let the entire army move forward . &quot;if victory is to be won.&quot;strike against the Government, Is it?   Then &quot;let the community settle it by wiping out the &quot;LIARS,&quot;John S, Clarke iB a lecturer at the Central Labour College, Glasgow, and a teacher at the Proletarian College, Glasgow.   He is also on the editorial staff of*&quot;Data,&quot; the organ of the Socialist Information and Research Bureau, end the author of &quot;Satires, Lyrics and&apos;* *Poems,&quot; published by the Socialist Labour Press, 50, Renfrew Street, Glasgow. Clarke is fairly educated. He is a leading spirit in the Clyde Soviet, which is reported to have made considerable progress in organisation/
organisation.IRELAND    &apos;     &apos;All has been quiet In Sinn Fein oirolos in, the dublin area recently.   The Sinn Miners hare taken upnew quarters at 76, Harcourt Street, but no businessappears to bo transacted there at present.   The DailEire&amp;nn may possibly adopt this address for*their headquarters. -Except for the spirit of lawlessness and disloyaltywhich still prevails throughout parts of Muuster, Corkand Clare, the week passed quietly throughout theProvinces, with nothing to indicate any new movement onthe part of Sinn Fein,The chief activities are mainly confined to registration work in the revision, court and to ratherhalf-hearted attempts to push the Irish National loan*of a quarter of a million, which the Government has declared to be illegal.   Sinn Fein meetings; however, have not been so numerous or so well attended during &apos; the past week,   &quot;Tho Voice of Labour,&quot; the official organ of the Irish Transport Workers Union, which was ^suppressed with, others for publishing particulars of the Irish National Loan, has been replaced by the &quot;Watchword of Labour&quot; and is :being printed by ths National Labour Press, Manchester, but. owing to the Brdlway Strike it failed to arrive.Political matters generally have been rather overshadowed by the Hallway Strike in England.   Irish  .Railway employees wore reported to bo prepared, though in some instances reluctantly, to support their comrades&apos; in England,   Tho termination of the strike has no doubt prevented the Sinn Fein party, which still considers itself to be in a state of war with England, from profiting by the disorderly turn of events,B0cLTe
