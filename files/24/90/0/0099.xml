CONFIDENTIAL.FOREIGN OFFICE,16.10.19.Russia/027.CONFLICTING REPORTS ON CONDITIONS IN SOVIET RUSSIA,Difficulties of Obtaining Information.No authoritative statement has ever been made about conditions in Soviet Russia and there if; no question upon which people differ more widely.     This is due partly to an acute feeling .of partisanship vhich rejects any facts or arguments which plead either lev or against the Soviets as the case may be, partly to the very real difficulty,sf closely examining conditions on the spot.Since September 1918 H.M. Government has had no official representatives in Soviet Russia,  and no newspaper correspondents are allowed to send messages unless their views are agreeable to the Soviet Government.   Thus there has never been any opportunity of following the development of Bolshevism in Russia through its different phases.     Occasional refugees., whether British or Russian, are not always reliable witnesses; moreover the conditions under which they have lived have In most cases made it impossible for them to form a sound judgment on many important aspects of Bolshevist policy.     le are there-fore forced intc the position of having to fcrrr the best possible judgment en the mass of material that reaches this country from all kinds of sources.     The object cf this meirw-randum is to enumerate the reports which have been received by tho Fcreign Office, whether privately or officially, to summarise their contents and to weigh the evidence both for and against the J31-viet Government.
SouroeE j?L ^LPISii?.11,The absence of&quot; direct information from SovietRussia dates from October 1918 vhen the last official representatives of H.iv. Government had left the country.Since that time information has reached the Foreign Office from:(1) Bolshevist sources - wireless messages, nevspapersetc.(2) British: PUb j sets..     The only British subjects who have entered Russia and had any opportunity cf examining con-*ditions on the rpot are i\.r. Dukes, vho lived there from December 1918 to September 1919, Px, Rafcroroe vho spent 6 weeks in &quot;soscov from February to I arch 1919, and ]-:r. Goode, vht*-ilived f.ar a fev; weeks in hoscov in September 1919. The tvo former have sent their reports direct to the Foreign Office, the latter has published his experiences in the daily press.Apart from these three sources British subjects, vho entered Russia vith the avowed object of reporting on con-ditions there, numerous British subjects, vhose home vps in Russia, have returned to this country.   The majority of them have been interviewed in the Foreign Office and reports! of all such interviews have been preserved.(5) Russians. - In addition to British subjects a large number of Rus? fans have escaped from their country and have published account? of conditions in Russia,   as these Russians are all anti-Bolshevik they can hardly be regarded as unprecedented-prejudiced observers, though the majority of their statements are confirmed from other sources.   It is, however, unnecessary to summarise their statements, as they denounce every aspect of Bolshevist policy and do not help to explain hov. the conflict of opinion in this country about Soviet Ruj. sia has arisen.
(;&apos;) Americans. - The most sensational evidence came from, a misi ion of 3 Americans - Messrs. Bullitt, Steffens and Pettit -who stayed one week&quot; (in one case 2 or 3 weeks) in Soviet Russia and .sont official reports to the American Delegation in Par ir .It \u 11 he useful to examine &amp;ach of these sources of information, apraise its value and attempt to drav from them the most accurate picture of conditions as they really are.Bolshevist Sources,The Bolshevist newspapers and vireless telegrams are the least trustworthy sources of information.   The Bol-shevist newspapers from October 1918 to march 1919 were care-fully examined in the Foreign Office;   since larch 1919 only occasional copies have reached this country.   They are, of course, used almost entirely for propaganda and contain, nothing that is Intended to be unfavourable to the Bolshevik regime. Their foreign news is hopelessly garbled.   No British wireless messages are printed and the only news  published is that which rill convey the impression that England and ether European countries are on the verge of revolution.   Worthless as a picture 6f conditions in foreign countries, they are equally worthless as a picture cf conditions in Russia.   Home nevs is confined to official decrees, speeches in the Soviets, resolutions passed at Bolshevist meetings or resolutions ofydnon-Bolshevist parties which are tolerated by the Soviet GovernV ment in so far as they-support the most important items of Soviet policy.   Anybody who relied solely on the Bols) evict press for information vquid gain the impression that opposition to the Soviet Government scarcely existed, that all the Socialist parties (except a few Socialist traitors, living
abroad) had rallied to the Government,, that the &quot;terror&quot; had ceased, that food supplies were improving, that an enormous amount of constructive work was being performed.   It is only by reading between the lines that one learns that desertion from the Red Army Is frequent, that graft on the past? of Commissars is not unheard-of, that secret counter-revolutionary organisations exist and have to be suppressed, that elections for the Soviet have to be carefully stage-managed and that the Communist party does not only consist of Communists and its membership has from time to time to be revised.,, The Bolshevist wireless is of the same character as the Bolshevist press.   It contains an enormous number of resolutions with the object of proving the strength of the Government, but as it is intended entirely for propaganda abroad it has for. many months laid chief emphasis on the new moderate phase of Bolshevism in Russia.   This, is of special importance, as it iu possible to trace a very close resemblance between, this form of Bolshevik propaganda and the reports supplied by such apologists of the Bolshevist regime as Hessrs. Ransome and Bullitt.   To quote an example.   Both Messrs, Ransome and Bullitt in their reports have laid great stress on the state-ments made to them by Volski and Kartov, the former a Social Revolutionary and the latter a Left Kenshevik, who declared that, while being anti-Communist, they looked on the Communists as the defenders of the Russian Revolution against kolchak and Denikin and for that reason were willing to co-operate with the Soviet Government not only against ivolchak and Denikin but against all forms of foreign intervention.   For some weeks the Bolshevist wireless was repeating these declarations ad nauseam and was drawing the same conclusions as Messrs, Ransome and Bullitt
..     5.r Itdrew.   This is but one case of many.     So far as real information goes these facts are of no value, as Volski and Martov represent only themselves and do not speak in the name of the parties they claim to.The real value of the Bolshevist wireless to us is not information about conditions in Russia, &quot;but information &quot;about Bolshevist policy towards the Allies,   $hat we learn from it is that the Bolsheviks desire peace in order to get a breathing-space and to break down the resistance of IColchak and Denikin by propaganda, and that in order to induce the Allies to conclude peace with them they wish to convey the impression that there is little or no feeling against them in Soviet Russia, that the &quot;terror&quot; has ceased, that the Soviet Government has modified its internal programme and has moved to the Right.British Sources.The most important reports from British sources have been those of irr. Ransoms and Mr, Dukes, as they both visited Russia for the express purpose of examining political, social and economic conditions on the spot.Mr. Ransome left Moscow on&apos;march 14, 1919, and sent a long report to the Foreign Office on the &quot;State of Russia&quot; dated April 2.   His report first of all explains, the sources of his information and then reviews the situation as he found it. (a) Sources of Information.Kr. Ransome saw Martcv, Volski, Sukhanov and many non-political people, including leather manufacturers and cotton, workers.   He also saw &quot;old acquaintances returning, from the various fronts and from the country districts both Bolshevik and &quot;non-Bolshevik and of all classes&quot;.    Tifhile in Moscow he .vas entirely uncontrolled and went to meetings where he heard
\of the Bolsheviks both from the Right and the Loft.   He also saw English prisoners both men and officers.Y.hat is the value of Mr. Ransome1s sources of information?   The evidence cf Mart6v, Volski and Sukhanov is of little value or interest, as they are all extreme Socialists and their opposition to the Soviet Government is purely theoretical They are all internationalists and represent no real current of popular feeling.   The reference to &quot;leather manufacturers and cotton workers&quot; is toe-vague to be convincing^ as also are Mr. Ransome&apos;s &quot;old acquaintances&quot;.   Mr. Ransome may have seen the British prisoners, but several of them have since returned and show very little sympathy with Mr. Rans$mefs peculiar opinions about the Bolsheviks.   The meetings attended by ftr, Ransome could not be of any special interest, as no meetings are allowed by the Bolsheviks which are not agreeable to them.   Mr. Ransome was the guest of the Soviet Government and it is difficult to believe that his movements were not very carefully watched.   Ho-real anti-Bolshevik would endanger his life by talking to him freely,(b) Situation in Russia.Mr. Ransomefs main arguments are the following:-(1) The Soviet Government is strengthened by armed intervention on the fringes of Russia, as war against it is war-against every political party in Russia.(2) Foreign intervention silences opposition to the Bolsheviks v ithin.(5) Power cf the Extraordinary Commission has been curtailed etc.(4) Great schemes are being carried out for constructive work, e.g. electrification of Petrr-grad by water power.
Let us..ermine-each of these points.(1) Mr. Ran some basesthis-&quot;lnf ormatlon on conversations with several Socialists who have no political party behind them. The eld political parties were suppressed by the Bolsheviks and now work underground.   All the moderate Socialist parties    rr together with the Cadets and Octcbrists have been working secretly in the National Centre in Moscow end elsewrhere, which feupports Denikin, desires foreign intervention and accepts the idea of a temporary military dictatorship.   Mr. Dukes was in Close touch-with these parties of which Mr. Ransome saw nothing.(2) Mr. Ransome, not having been in touch with the masses, fails to realise that the desire for the British to come is almost universal.   All other Englishmen who have come from Russia and have been interviewed atjthe Foreign Office have said that they were repeatedly asked when the English were coming. Mr. Keeling reported that every Trade Union in Petrograd desired the English to free them from the Bolsheviks.(3) The curtailment of the powers of the Extraordinary Commission always remained a dead letter.   The Extraordinary Commission has always remained the real ruler of Russia and would never abandon its powers.     It was replaced by the Revolutionary Tribunals in some of the provincial towns, but even then it remained the real master behind the scenes and the Revolutionary Tribunals were little better.      Every other British report agrees that no change was ever observed such a? Mr. Ransome describes and the &quot;terror&quot; that has raged this summer is the most convincing answer.   Mr. Dukes himself experienced the &quot;terror&quot; in Petrograd in June when it was at its worst.(4) Mr. Ransome accepts all that the Commissaries told him about their constructive work, but when cross-questioned
&quot;has to admit that he did not himself see any of the results. He can only produce written statements.   l\b other Br.itish subject^ and many were asked this question, had ever heard of anything ltx.* Ransome refers to and simply laughed at the suggestion.Ir, Rannorne in his report to the Foreign Office produced no further arguments and the book he published subsequently merely enlarged on these points and made many insinuations, none of which he attempted to prove.. Mr. Dukss.(a) Sources of Information.Mr. Dukes lived as a Russian for 10 months In petrograd&apos; and Moscow.   He was in touch with all classes, working-men, soldiers, peasants, doctors, lawyers, engineers, politicians, landowners.   He read all the Bolshevik papers, checked their statements and verified reports he received fror numenous sources. He sent regular reports to the Foreign Office the whole time he was in Russia.(b) Situation in Russia.(1) The real power in. Russia is the ExtraordinaryCommission.(2) All classes, especially the workmen, are violently hostile to the Bolsheviks.(3) General Denikin would be welcomed by everybody in Moscow and Petrograd with the exception of the Communists who are 3;. of the population and those who have compromised themselves in their dealings with the Bolsheviks.(4) The Soviet Government has failed to constructanything.(5) The famine in the big towns is artificial and
due to the decrees of the Bolsheviks,Let us examine each of these points..(1) Lenin&apos;s -speeches shov that for purely tactical reaons he has tried to he moderate, as he realised that the extreme application of his doctrines had roused violent opposition.   In iUarch 1919 he outlined the modifications in his programme in a much-advertised speech,   He did attempt to con-trol the Extraordinary Commission, as its excesses were doing the Bolsheviks harm, but he never succeeded and Trotski and Zinoviev, who favour the Extraordinary Commission, have had more power than Lenin,   Sincviev&apos;s rule in Petrograd is almost absolute, but that is only due to the fact that the Extraordinary Commission supports him.   It is far the most powerful organisation in the country, but in each centre its agents act independently of Moscow where are the nominal headquarters,(2) This is proved by the constant strikes especially in Petrograd.     The peasants shew their hostility by refusing to-part with their grain and by innumerable armed risings in every government in Soviet Russia,(3) Mr. Dukes&apos; statements have been confirmed by numerous Russians including Mr. Alexinski, the well-known Socialist, who left Moscow in June 1919 and has now gone to join General Denikin in South Russia,   All Russians living abroad would not agree on this point, but the vast majority of those who have escaped support General Denikin.   It is impossible to check Mr. Dukes&apos; statement any further than this.(i) It is inconceivable that if the Soviet Government had constructed anything ve should have failed to hear ofit. le know that the output from the factories is at the most lo/a of the normal, and we know that strikes are of almost daily
occurrence.     As transport has broken down and people in the towns are starving, constructive work would be beyond the powers of any Government under such conditions.(5) The harvest this year in Russia has been the best known i-ov 20 years.   The Bolsheviks themselves admit that the peasants have huge stores of grain.   The-famine is due chiefly to&apos;the decrees against, private trading   and the way grain is stolen from the peasants on. the outskirts, of the towns. Mr, Keeling witnessed cases of this outside Petrograd.III. other British Sources.Records, of interviews with 14 British subjects wha:returned from Russia between December 1918 and April 1919 havebeen preserved in the Political Intelligence Department of theForeign Office.   None of these people professed ta have anyspecial political knowledge and they all confined themselves to -accounts of&apos;conditions in Petrograd and Moscow as they saw them.The point of view of each one cf these people is the same.   Themain points they insist on are:-(1) Hostility of the workmen and peasants to the Soviet Government&apos;.(2) Hatred of all Bolshevik Commissars and Jews..(5) Continuance of the &quot;terror&quot;..(4).Violent interference with every detail of private life.(5) Appalling food and sanitary conditions.(6) Ruthless requisitions and conscription for the Red Army.As there is little that is new in any of their statements it is hardly necessary to examine them in detail. The only admission that was ever recorded in favour of the Bol-sheviks was their attempt to feed the children.   The most inter-esting. information was- given by Mr. Keeling, a workman, who con-
firmed almost everything that.--Mr. Dukes ha^ reported up to that time and has since reported.American,. Source s.The only information from American sources eons ists of the reports sent by Messrs. Bullitt, Steffens and Pettit at the end of Karch.   As all three reports are very similar it is only necessary to examine the most important of them, that of Nr. Bullitt. (a) Sources of Information,,Mr. Bullitt was exactly one week in Kos cow.   He was there at the same time as Mr. Ransome and was in close communication with him.   As far as can be judged from his&apos;report, his sources of information are the same as those of Mr. Ransome. The only sources he mentions in his report are members of the Soviet Government and Messrs. Yolski and Martfw who have already been referred t$ in the Examination of Mr. Ransome&apos;s report, (b) Situation in Russia,.Mr. Bullitt&apos;s main points are as follows (1) Conditions are bad owing to lead transport. (2) Industry is at a standstill owing to bad transport and military requirements.(3): Food distribution is well controlled,(4) Loafing by workmen during working hours has been overcome.(5) The destructive phase of the Revolution is over. The energy of the Government is turned to constructive work. (G) The &quot;terror&quot; has ceased.(7) All power *f judgment has been taken ay ay from the Extraordinary Commission which now merely -accuses suspected counter revolutionaries who are tried by the established regular tribunals.    Executions are extremely rare etc.
(8) The people lay the blame for their distress wholly on the blockade and on the. Governments which maintain it.(S) The Soviet form ofGovernment has acquired so great a hold on the imagination of the common people that the women are ready to starve and the- young ion to die for it.(10) Blockade and intervention have caused,the chief Opposition Parties, the Right Social Revolutionaries and the kensheviks to give temporary support to the Communists.Let us examine each of these points..,(1) Hr. BullittTs statements about bad transport are confirmed by all who have returned from Russia.     The only difference between Mr. Bullitt1s report and other reports we have received is that Mr. Bullitt attempts to excuse the Soviet Government for the disorganisation of transport.   This is partly correct, but Mr. Bullitt omits to mention that the present disorganisation is to a large extent the result of Bolshevist methods and their absolute failure to F^ko^nx^i^i^o^^ents during the tine they have been in power.(2) Mr. Bullitt&apos;s explanation ignores many facts.   ^ does net mention, for examplej that one of the chief reasons why industry is. at a standstill is the impossible way in which factories are managed and the extraordinary discontent of the workmen vith the present Government.(3) It is difficult to agree that food distribution is well controlled.   If it were, what is the reason for the enormous amount of speculation in foodstuffs which goes on in Petrograd and Toscow?    So long as certain classes of the population are deliberately deprived of food, it is impossible for any government system of food-distribution to %ork smoothly.(4) It may be true that workmen do not loaf during working hours, owing to the system of &quot;terror&quot; that reigns in the factories.   Oneof the reasons why there is little loafing
is that thema j-orlty^&apos;---th-e-.Jr:actorrles.. have &quot;&quot;been- closed, and meet of&apos; the &quot;workmen have been drafted into the Red Army.(5) l/.r. Bullitt here makes the same assertion as Hr. Ransome, but produces no facts to prove his contention.   The same answer may be given to Mr, Bullitt as has already been given to Mr. Ransome.., (6) Ttiis is a more sweeping assertion than any that has been made by Mr. Ransome,   but the answer already given applies hr re too.(7) This has already been answered in the criticism of Mr. Ransoms&apos;s statement.(8) This has also been answered in the criticism of Mr&apos;. Ransome1 s statement.(.9) It would be interesting to know how many women gladly accept starvation.    If their numbers are large, the Russians must be a nation very different from an  other portion of the human race.   There are, it is true, some young men who willingly join the Red Army and will fight to the last, but this is true of a very small number and Mr. Bullitfs statement is far too sweeping.(10) Mr. Bullitt seems to know very little about the secret organisation of the parties he refers to which have for the most part thrown in their let with the National Centre in Moscow. The names he quotes as representing, these parties are the same as those quoted by l\ir. Ransome.The most interesting feature of Mr. Bullitt&apos;s report, which is far more sweeping than Mr. Ransome&apos;s, is that in all essentials it corresponds exactly with the statements made by Mr. Ransome and contains nothing new.     Mr. Ransome obviously knows more about conditions in Russia and for that very reason is less sweeping in his statements.     It is&apos; obvious that a   -
great deal has been pumped Into fir. Bullitt which he has accepted without having had the time.or the knowledge to verify any of the d . ta il s .Genera! Review of the Situation in Scyley Russia.The salient features in the situation in Soviet Russia to-day are:(1) The lack of power cf the Central Government inHoscow.(2) The complete failure of the Government to organise any constructive golicy.(3) The failure to carry out any land policy.(4) The general breaking-up of the forces which the Soviet Government has hitherto relied upon.(1) The much advertised Soviet Government in Moscow which speaks to the outside world through the mouths of Lenin, Chicherin and Litvinov has, as a matter of fact, very little real power in Russia.     The real pover is in the hands not of Lenin but of the Extraordinary Commission, and only these members of the Soviet Government enjoy power who work in close understanding with the leaders of the Extraordinary Commission.   The most con-vincing proof of this assertion is the history of the conflict between Lenin and Zincviev who has acted in Petrograd as an all-powerful dictator.   Lenin has several times attempted to b:&apos;lng Zincviev to book and there have been rumours from time to time that Zinoviev would be forced to relinquish his authority in Petrograd.   Each time, however, Zinoviec has survived.   The true explanation of this is tba t Mnoviev has kept the support of the Ixtraorcinary Commission and that he and Trotski by so doing have prevented any attempt which otherwise might have been made to modify the policy ofthe Soviet Government in a more liberal
direction.     It is indeed doubtful tc what extent Lenin reallyintended to modify his policy, but, even admitting that he didhave such an Intention, it is clear that he has entirely failedto carry it&apos; out and that those who maintained that the only hope for the Government was to continue its brutal regime of force andterror have gained the day. *Those who have attempted to whitewash the Soviet Government have endeavoured to ignore the real position of the Extraordinary Commission.   They have asserted from time tc time that the terror has ceased, but the fact remains that the worst terror known under the Bolshevist regime was carried out by Peters in the name of the Extraordinary Commission during the summer of 1919,     The terror shows itself mof.t strongly at different periods and lasts in its acute phase for a comparatively short time, but tho terror exists all the time and even when executions are less frequent the system, of spying and requisitioning continues unabated.     The position is such that net only is it quite impossible for the Soviet Government to modify its policy and make an attempt at gaining popular support, but that even if&quot; it did make the attempt the gulf is now so wide between the Govern-ment and the people that it could only end in disaster and anarchy .   All talk, therefore, of the evolution of democracy from Bolshevism is without any foundation upon the actual conditions that prevail in Russia,(2) Bolshevist propaganda has repeatedly asserted that the period of destruction has now passed and that the Government has concentrated on real constructive work. Much has appeared on paper to attempt to prove the truth of this assertion, but no facts have been produced which confirm it.   The output from the
factori.es has steadily decreased, prices have risen, transport is continually getting worse.     The Commissariat of PeopleTs Economy which is supposed to he the main instrument for building up the economic life of the country, has endeavoured to put its extreme socialistic theories into operation by nationalising every form of human activity, with the result that in the towns there is practically nothing to be obtained in the shops, and the supply cf food controlled by the Commissariat is so small that speculation in the streets is rife.(3) The land policy of the Soviet Government is pei^haps the most convincing proof of the failure of Bolshevism..     On June 10 1918, the nctcrious Pauper Committees were formed in the villages. The object was to gain the support of the poorer peasants against the more prosperous ones who have begun to show their open hostility to the Bolshevist regime.   The Government considered that through the Paui^ r Committees they would obtain a large measure of support in the country from the poorer peasants, but the results were most unexpected.   At first the new institutions were welcomed by the poorer peasants who proceeded to rc.ib from the more prosperous ones everything they possessed.     Thereupon the poorer peasants:became prosperous and immediately began to oppose the Government, the formetf prosperous peasants continuing their anti-Bolshevist agitation.   After several months the Government realised that the Pauper Committees had now definitely become anti-Bolshevik, and in December 1918 they were dissolved.   The dissolution of the Pauper Committees has been represented abroad as evidence of the mere moderate policy of the Bolsheviks.   As a matter of fact it was nothing of the scrt. It was succeeded by far mere drastic measures of control by the Central Government    The Pauper Committees continued to exist in various places throughout the winter and
early spring of 1919, being gradually replaced by the new system which consisted of the setting up of Soviets throughout the villages composed of people specially appointed by Commissars whowent sent from Moscow to choose only those men who could be reliedr. upon to support the Government.     The result now- is that the -   -peasants completely ignore the Soviets that have been imposedupon them and whenever the Soviet attempts to enforce the decreesof the Central Government the peasants rise in revolt.     Theserevolts are taking place all the time in various parts of Russia.The revolting peasants dismiss the Soviet, murder as many of its members as they can lay hands on, set up a new committee and, when t(fey can, throw in their lot with the Green Guards.   Thus, the failure of the Government to evolve a land policy is now complete, and without a iand policy it is impossible for them to establish themselves firm ly in power.(4) The crumbling of the Red Armies is shown by the rapid advances now being made by the forces under Denikin, Kolchak and Yudenich.   yudenichTs army is really of little value as a military force and his recent advance towards Petrograd is the most con-vincing pr oof of the growing weakness of the Red Army,   Another sign that the Red Armies are dissolving is the rapid growth of what is known as the Green Guards who are said to number at least 300,000.   The Green Guards consist of deserters from the Red Army who maintain a purely negative attitude of hostility towards all Bolsheviks and Jews but hesitate to throw in their lot with the Whites.   They are fed gratuitously by the peasants and have, no &apos;doubt, very largely led to the success of the armies opposed to the&apos; Bolsheviks.   Many of them no doubt have now coalesced with the advancing army of Denikin and no cases have been reported cf fighting between the Greens and the Vihites.   Provided the 7,-hites behave in a reasonable manner &amp;$ they advance,- t^here should be little difficulty in gaining the support - net-*nly of the Greens &quot;but cf the peasants as a whole.
