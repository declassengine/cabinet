Cjhis doculjIjht is the property of his briiamiiiq majesty&apos;-s (Kjvepjtoiii)S B 0 R S Tca   f&quot;&apos;;\0*JP-8385.    \    &amp;        WAR    0 A B I I B TrOOMBIggg BILL, Memorandum from the First Commissioner of Works.To the War Cabinet,I view with some anxiety the effect of introducing , a Bill of the character of the Combines Bill, on commerce and industry at the present mementoThe subject with which the Bill endeavours to deal Is one of the most difficult and complicated of modern industrial development,   legislation aiming to abolish or control combinations and their results, has been tried In the past in this and other countries, and of recent years more especially in the United States of America.     Whilst this legislation has tended to disturb industrial combinations and create a state of distrust among the commercial world, I am not aware that it has ever yet achieved its object.   In fact, recently in Amerioa combination for export purposes has been usually recognised..     It has to be admitted,that a very important portion Cf modern industry and commerce is carried 2a by 0combinations among manufacturers and traders, both of an internal and international character.   The powor of pro-duction in industries is so great that fluctuation of prices, causing dislocation and unemployment must occur if some such methods of regulation of prbducticn are not adopted^   The size of modern Industry compels the traders of different countries to combine in selling and to form organisations to enable them to carry on joint propaganda, especially in export markets, so as to save general expenses.     They are also compelled to enter into arrangements with associations of manufacturers in other countries in regard to quantities of supply, prices and limitation of markets.The first question whioh really wants deciding is whether such combinations are harmful or beneficial to ta trade and to the community, and if they are harmful, how far it is advisable or possible to control them.   The present Bill apparently assumes, that control of such combinations is neces-sary in the public interest, and I admit that arguments may be   , found in favour of such a proposition.   Th3 method, however, by which it is proposed to carry out suoh control seems to me to be of such a far-reaching character and to give such arbitrary powers to a Government Department to interfere both with the methods of carrying on business and with profits, that I feel certain the Bill will meet with the very strongest opposition from,   commercial circles, and may easily create such feelings of uncertainty and discouragement as to very / seriously affect the trade of the country.     There is no certainty or finality in the proposed operations of the Bill, The disclosure in public of the affairs of any business may result in incalculable danger to it.     Ijfc may be presumed that every effort will be made/
made to evade the provisions of such legislation&apos;in this country, as has been the case in other countries.   Combination agreements instead of being properly drawn up by contract, will become hidden and verbal agreements, such as the well known instances that followed similar legislation in.the United States.The Government at present is   urging employers to join &quot;Federations, and to co-operate and co-ordinate their industries. This policy being adopted and the Trade Union Organisations working on the same lines and the same principles, it 3eems to me somewhat contradictory to introduce legislation which is bound to operate in a contrary manner.The Clause to deal with the exercise by a single Company of a monopoly or substantial control by a single Company has never been - attempted before, and introduces into cur legis-lation an entirely new principle.   It places any firm which has been able by greater technical skill,, or commercial ability to obtain a commanding position in any industry, in danger of finding itself penalised in a manner which other less euccess-ful businesses need net fear&apos;,   ffit creates a premium, on the want of enterprise and slackness in industrial development.At the present moment when industry i3 slowly reviving in this country and the industrial world is   harassed by the uncertainty of commercial conditions, difficulties of finance and exchange ana difficulties of labour, and. when, as I can state from personal-knowledge, it needs all possible encourage-ments to induce .British manufacturers to carry on and British -capital to invest in-industry In&apos;this country, the effect of introducing a Bill of this character, for which there has been no popular demand, and which has not in any way been fore-shadowed in the commercial world, may well prove calamitous.(Sgd.)
