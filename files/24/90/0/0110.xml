*&quot;\% MEMORANDUM BY THE! SHIPPING CONTROLLER....._____-^W The Shipping Controller &quot;begs reference to the Pood Controller&apos;sALL G^Memorandum G.T.8353.Food Ministry for so long a period.   He is of opinion that however necessary food control may have been during the period of the war and up to recent date, nothing is now doing more harm in the country than the prevention of return to ordinary conditions of living and commerce consequent on the continued control of food and other commodities.other commodities could be controlled, when considered necessary, under the Profiteering Act or by a Department of the Board of Trade with power to impose a maximum price on any commodity what soever instead of any continuance of the present system.at less money than would be done by private enterprise but that exactly contrariwise is the true position.He is of opinion that generally the Government pay higher prices for commodities than private individuals and when flat prices are arranged, say for wheat, etc, it is the maximum and not the minimum price which Government pays to the exporting countries.Government trading Interferes with all ordinary competition, which is the &quot;soul&quot; of       trade and the &quot;medium&quot; of low prices, and merchants of all kinds are prevented from exercising genius and ordinary business capacity.     Traders cannot be expected to run ordinary risks so long as the Government are dealers.The difficulties of the Shipping Ministry have been accentuated (^eyond words by Government purchases.   It is principally by Government goods our quays and docks and railways are blocked.     The lack of system and the diversion from visual channels of distribution, affects almost every port and until we revert to normal conditions, the country will suffer.He takes exception to the proposal for the continuance of theThe Shipping Controller suggests that the price of food andHe does not believe that commodities are purchased by Government and- retailed to the public, except when directly subsided,
War Cabinet memorandum d.T.8309, paragraph 5.A. furnishesproof of this.    Its authority is strengthened by the fact that 4ministers were present in person and a 5th was represented by 4people at the Conference of which G.T.8309 is a report * of which thefollowing is an extract. The Conference desired to record their opinion that5 (a)        Congestion of traffic could not be completely prevented so long as the imports of imported commodities&apos; are under the control of Government Departments and that a return to normal conditions whereby such imports are in the hands of private traders is essential to a permanent solution of the problem.Special reference is asked to the report of the ShipLicensing Committee attached hereto as deserving of serious consider-ation.In the opinion of the Shipping Controller4 (J.T.8309 paragraph 5 (a) taken together with the report of the Ship Licensing Coijmsittee which he generally endorses present an irresistible but fey no means exhaustive case for ending the present policy of general control and for the consequent rejection of the porposal to perpetuate an . important section of it.In the event of a strike it will surely be the function of the Transport Ministry to organise transport.25th Ootober, 1919..

i559Report by Ship Licensing Committee.Part lj History, Argument and Recommendation of Abolition. Part 2*, Consideration of Secondary Consequences of Abolition Part 3, Summary.MWMMmqqqwmMMMPart 1^ History, Argument &amp; Recommendation of  Abolition (1). The inauguration of the policy of release of Shipping last January showed clearly that HMO- Intended to rely on private enterprise for the maintenance of the population of the U.K. at or above its present level,   At that time the stage of recovery from War reached by the Mercantile Community coupled with the obligations of HMG to Allied Governments were such as precluded on practical grounds an immediate reversion to pre-war freedom. Consequently a system of Ship Licensing $ Direction was employed designed to provide a gradual but continuous approach to the end desired.The immediate objects placed before the Committee were the maintenance of the supplies essential to the U.K., and the execution of the tonnage agreements with Prance and Italy. Both these objects were achieved.aThe obligations to the Allies having lapsed, the maintenance of supplies has been rendered easier, and at the same time a considerable amount of commercial activity has been restored... It is hardly necessary to mention that the complete restoration of commercial activity is vitally necessary if this country is to continue to support 45,000,000 people. (2).   Progress towards this end has been continuous almost from the beginning when nearly every free tramp required Direction and the cargoes carried by the Liners Prescription within narrow limits.
An important step was taken in March when the single voyage Licences then required for every Liner were con-verted into General Licences covering largo blocks of tonnage.   These General Licences while safeguarding the importation of essential commodities increased the fluidity of tonnage and at the same time provided increased scope for commerce,A further measure of relief was afforded by the expiry of the Tonnage agreements with Prance and Italy on June 30th.To-day the position requires the direction of comparatively few tramps, and the prescription of cargoes carried by Liners is confined to the commodities imported at artificial rates of freight.The benefit of this oontinued progress towards freedom is shown by the figures in the recent statement by the Port and Transit Executive Committee to the effect that the Import of Pood and Raw Materials has increased from 55$ of the pre-war rate at the beginning of the year to 8C$ of the pre-war rate in July,(3), That Ship Licensing and Direction continue to be em-ployed is due solely to the policy of HMG in prescribing the provision of favoured rates of freight in respect ofthe four following ImportsAnnual Import Tons   j of Total importsWheat &amp; Flour&amp; Maize 7750;000 19,5Sugar i;5oo;oco 4.Part of Timber        3,COO; 000 7.5Iron Ore 5^00)000 14.0Total Tons   17,750,000 Total % 45.The Total Annual Imports of all classes Pre-War and Present may be stated as followsi-Pre-War Tons 1919 Tons56,000,000 about 40,000,000
Except in so far as economy in consumption or Home Production can enable the country to dispense with Imports, it is essential to the maintenance of the 45,000,000 people in the U.K. that the pre-war volume o$ Imports should be restored.   Restoration is hampered by many things including shortage of coal, labour difficulties and finance, but the chief cause is congestion of Port and Internal Traffic facilities,The report of the Port &amp; Transit Executive Committee is con-clusive on this point, . Most emphatically it is not being ham-hampered by shortage of Shipping and consequently the Ship licensed-sing system cannot help matters.(4). In the working of the Licensing system it has become clear that any reduction in the degree of interference with Co?nmerce due to the forcible Direction of tonnage to lift the favoured Imports, is followed by a steady fall in the rates of freight on oommodities in which an active business is being done. The best example is perhaps that of Oil Seeds from India,   Here a steady policy of granting Licences without a break has been followed by a reduction in chartered freight rates of about  4 per ton.   This has occurred within the space of about a month. It is remarkable that in spite of the rise in the value of the Rupee during the same month, the London prices of some Indian Oil Seeds have fallen even more than the Freight. (5). While it has been shown above that a policy of no -inter-ference reduces freight rates, It may be inferred with certainty that the converse is also true, and that interference, increases freight rates.   It would be easy to supply a practical de-monstration of this truth.   If the next two vessels which apply for Licences to carry Oil Seeds from India were Directed to carry any of the favoured Imports instead, the freight market
for Oil Seeds would rise immediately and sharply.   The London prices of Oil Seeds would probably do the same. As the sole reason for interference with Commerce by means of the system of Ship Licensing and Direction is to provide the freight space required by EMG in respect of the favoured portion of the U. *Imports, it is true to say that the effect is to raise the rates of freight on the whole of the remainder. (6). This remainder consists of a vast number of commodities and articles including almost the whole of the raw materials necessary for the manufacture of the Country&apos;s Exports and these Imports with but trivial exceptions, are as essential to the maintenance of the 45,000,000 people in tho U..K. as are the favoured Imports.They are necessary to TRADE.   It is Trade and Foreign Trade alone which has doubled the U.K. population in less than 100 years and it is Trade and Foreign Trade alone which can maintain the present figures.The Government have admitted the necessity by the recent decision in favour of the abolition of Restrictions on Imports. (7). The policy of the Licensing Committee is necessarily governed by the demands which from time to time the Departments responsible for the favoured imports make upon it.   In the case of grain and sugar these demands depend upon factors unknown to the commercial world since the Government is the only operator in these markets and prices are controlled.   The impossibility of anticipating the exact incidence of these demands on tonnage precludes the Licensing Committee from committing Itself by any public statement of policy and its motives and working are there-fore necessarily concealed from the public.The Ship Licensing system constitutes an element of uncertainty in the transactions of British overseas commerce.   In all
Commercial transactions- uncertainties are guarded against by insurance in one form or another.   Under the licensing system a trader effects this Insurance by striving to arrange his ship-ment a long time before Ihe goods would be required on the market if he were certain of their being allowed to come or by taking a foreign vessel at an enhanced rate of freight. It is hard to measure precisely what the premium paid for this insurance amounts to but inasmuch as its fcaymeni limits the operation of considerations both of the price of freight and of the possibility of postponement with safety and profit, it is certain that it is a very heavy one..(0)t There is an apt analogy to be found in many instances of Imports Programmed by Government Departments. First may be quoted bacon.   This was, till recently the subject of ,private trade.   Control was re-established at the moment when Imports were at their maximum.The first result has been serious congestion consequent on the controlling of, the article entailing delay in moving it.   The second result will be the cessation of the large volume consigned to this country unsold by American packers largely in U.S.A. tonnage.   Proof of this tendency will be found in special Report No.8. (circulated by the Directorate of Intelligence Home Office) containing the reported intention of the representative of the American Food Controller in this Country to reoommend the drastic reduction of exports to the T7.-&amp;. and the cessation of sending American produce to auction here.Now a Programme of Importation is demanded which is in excess of the probable consumption and admittedly in excess of the ability of the Department to store it except at the already congested ports.
It is beyond doubt that a system of imports which is obliged to ignore the smaller channels of trade and the smaller*facilities of distribution and storage is unable to deal as effectively with an import&apos; as a system which employs all facilities both large and small.Pit Props and Pit Wood have been an Import in effect Programmed by Government Departments for several years but have not been imported on Government aocount, ;,Less than three weeks ago because British vessels were not bring-ing the programmed quantities, pressure was applied to have these imports afforded priority over Iron Ore0    The request was declined, To-day there is conclusive evidence that South Wales is congested with this commoditye   .The execution of a contract  with U.S.A, suppliers in U.S.A. tonnage has been a contributory cause, but the pressure ignored the patent fact, that a falling output of coal reduced the consumption of props and.pit wood. Wool is on a slightly different basis,   Special causes enabled the Department responsible to make a contract with the Austral-asian Lines below the Government rate of freight.   As the Australasian Lines have fairly full services at the present time owing to the return of the troops, a programme of import is being executed in excess of consumption requirement and facility of disposal.   The congestion resulting is notorious. Tea will furnish another case if attention is paid to the present pressure on this subject.The trade is now in private hands but a programme had been laid down; this is now in arrear,r IIt is right that it should be in arrear as stocks here in July had accumulated to double the Pre-War figure and far in excess
51       l-lof any stocks held during the war.Moreover teas discharged from ship early in June hadnot reached warehouse up to middle of August.Prices here are said to have a rising tendency &amp; for thisreason pressure is &quot;being applied to have the old programmeexecuted in full.Of course this is no remedy &amp; the cause of any rise In price should be sought rather in the increase in the value of landed teas due to, the great delay between the ship  &amp; the shop,&apos; and the increased replacement costs due to the rising sterling value of the Rupee.These are typical Instances of the consequences of programmed Imports which all derive support from the Ship Licensing System. The foregoing instances may be summarised in a more general way as followsWhen an Import is programmed officially an estimate of require-ment Is formed and a margin for safety Is added, probably in several places.   The PROGRAMME achieves a species of sanction, possibly the whole quantity is purchased and In the event an import is made which often proves to be unnecessary either in quantity or for the time.   The result is congestion, waste of money and unnecessary burden on the Foreign Exchange.   The fact is that real efficiency and economy in Imports cannot be secured under any Programme system which aims at covering the entire requirement. It is necessarily far too rigid and lacks response to the infinite variations in requirement which are met automatically by free market importation;No system of supply can be otherwise than grossly extravagant which ignores considerations of price, quantity and time, Under the system of Ship Licensing &amp; Direction the whole of the Imports of the U. K. Programmed and Un-programmed, Subsidised &amp;
Unsubeidised ignore at least two of these essentials to economy. (10). Before concluding there is yet one further aspect of the case which should be mentioned.Before the war the Merchant importing what are now favoured imports could draw on the tonnage of any flag for his needs,. To-day in the absence of agreements forced on foreign countries by political or economic pressure the policy which requires the carriage of imports at rates of freight below the levaSl of the world market limits the imports of these commodities to British Vessels.   Anything which tends to prevent the perfect fluidity of tonnage involves a certain waste and therefore tend3 ipso facto to raise the general freight market.The force of this is illustrated by a comparison of the tonnage available for the favoured services before the war and at the  resent time.World Pre-7fer Tonnage Present British Tonnage45.4 million gross tons 18,1 million gross tons.It is idle to suppose that with the area of selection so restricted the same economy in the use of tonnage can be obtained. Further it is necessary to remember that though the total of British tonnage day appear ample in comparison with the favoured imports,   Foreign tonnage before the war was predominant In two of them (Ore &amp; Timber) by reason of its lower and cheaper class.(11). In the altered circumstances since the Armistice the system of Ship Licensing and Directions has become unnecessary - seeing that the limiting factor for imports has ceased to be ships and is the capacity of the country to absorb its imports through the ports - and harmful, in that it involves the payment of an extravagant premium against the uncertainty it causes. Commercial confidence in the country is growing.   Its growth wi11 be fostered if progress towards commercial freedom is accelerated.
, The exigencies created by^the - existence of apeciaJJy favoured 1imports are liable at any moment to des-troy all previous growth of confidence.For these reasons tho immediate abolition of the Licensing system is strongly urged.(12) The case for abolition is independent of, but is strengthened by the world&apos;s tonnage position as revealed in a comparison of pre-war and present figures.Pre-War World Steam Free en t Wo rl. d S te am,Tonnage     &apos;&quot; &quot;   &quot; gonni^e^        &quot;       47.9.45,4pillion gross Estimated Construction JSrOtons &quot;**World Tonnage&apos;atSlst December, 1919 50.9With this increase in world&apos;s tonnage no corresponding increasein the world&apos;s demand need be anticipated in the near future.*The tendency is clear, the fall in the freight market is certain and must be large.   The date of the fall is uncertain and the mere existence of the Licensing System is one of the factors delaying this falloAfter its abolition the 45,000,000 people in the U.K. will pay less total freight for their Imports &amp; thus their maintenance will be assistedo ____Part 2. Being a consideration of Secondary Consequences of the Abolition of the system of Ship Licence,,(1)9 In order that Part 1. of this report may be considered in all its bearings it is necessary to discuss certain secondary consequences and factors, not with the intention of pointing out real defects in the course proposed but to show that the matter has been considered fully.At the outset abolition will entail an increase in the rates of* * *freight paid on wheat, flour, maize, and sugar.   These rates will rise to a point probably somewhere below those now ruling to France but assuming that the rate paid was the same as that to Prance then
% * 10 -on the Royal Commissions1 Programmes of Import the maximum increase will not e*6eed:-  per monthWheat and Flour 875)000               &apos;,        Malfce 300J000   Total  1,475,000Sugar         . 300* 00-0Of this sum about  750,000 will return direct to the exchequer in the form of increased freight earned by the German ships nowunder British Control.   The net difference is thus reduced to 725,000 per month which would fall on the Exchequer 3o long asthe Bread Subsidy continues subject to any reduction due to thefall in the freight market indicated by the tonnage figures.   Ifthe financial terms of the Liner Agreement can be continued afterthe abolition of the Licensing System,  550,000 over a month wouldbe saved reducing the net monthly cost to  175,000.(2), Timber is in a different position.   Only a portion of theImport is conducted at directed rates, private imports being fully authorised^.   These rates are on a higher^ basis than the grain and Sugar rates.   Consequently the abolition of theShip Licensing System would be felt over but a partial area &amp;to a much smaller degree.Any difference in cost would not fall on the Exchequer, exceptin so far as the Governments&apos; housing policy may involve theassumption of an ultimate financial liability.The timber to be imported at directed rates is limited in amount and when imported its use is indiscriminate.As regards the supply,, there is serious congestion and delay inthe discharge,(3) The case of Iron Ore is special Inasmuch as the low freights are not fixed but follow naturally from the forcible Direction of
British Tonnage to a narrow market.At the outset the effect on ore-freights of the abolition of the Ship Licensing System may well be considerable. They are charged on but 40$ of the .U.K. consumption, the remainder being produced here.     . .The effect of abolition will be mitigated by the Import of . surplus French Pig iron to an amount (if the Technical Press is to be trusted) equal to 20$ of the U.K.ore import requirement. The incidental effect of the substitution of French pig iron  0% Spanish ore on the Spanish Exchange should be considerable. It is most important to remember that Foreign Tonnage formerly took a predominant part in this Import and that this Foreign tonnage driven away by the German submarine, is being kept away now by       uneconomic freights*If ever ore should be needed on the old scale it is doubtful whether the British tonnage of the special class suitable exists to carry it.Any cost of the abolition will not  all on the Exchequer. As regards the consumer, a positive statement has been made by a large consumer (a member of the Ship Licensing Committee) that the trade could if necessary pay double the present freights without affecting the prices of finished steel. (4) The abolition of the system of Ship Licensing will probably entail the discontinuance of control of the Coasting Trade which is conducted through the same machinery.   Primarily this has been necessary owing to the uneconomic level of Railway Goods Rates.Temporary expedients are in force t* cover this point until such time as H.M.Government are in a position to determine . their policy with regard to Railway Rates.
P&amp;rt summary.The Licensing System during the transition period from vrar to peace when the world&apos;s tonnage was insufficient to meet all the demands made upon it, has safeguarded the essential imports of the country and enabled the Government to meet its obligations to its Allies,The limiting factor for imports has now ceased to x$ ships and obligations to Allies have disappeared.The licensing system involves the payment of extravagant premiums by the commercial community against the uncertainty it causes. -By compelling a portion of the British Mercantile Marine to carry particular commodities at artificial rates of freight it increases the total freight paid by the ccmmunlty and thereby interposes a serious obstacle to the complete restoration of commercial activity.The Licensing System has therefore outlived its usefulness and its immediate abolition is urged in the interests of that complete restoration of commercial activity on which the maintenance of the United Kingdom and its population ultimately depends.(Signed) Percy BatesChairman (Signed) H.A,Thompson.Secretary.
