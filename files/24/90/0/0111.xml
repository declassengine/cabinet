1.   In my Report of July 18th on this subject/(G.T.7734) I said that I was satisfied that licensed premises and clubs were receiv-ing, and would continue to receive, a reasonable amount of spiritsj but that the private individual was bound to suffer ,so long as , the system of strictly allocated output was maintained.     I added : that it woulft, I thought, be advisable- to consider in the Autumn whether any, and, if so, what modifications of the present restrict-ions of output are desirable,&apos; -2,   When, in March 1917, the quantity of spirits permitted to be released from bond was, by the instructions of the Cabinet,, reduced. -to 50$ of the quantity released in 1916, it was made a condition under the regulations issued by H.M^Treasury that all spirits cleared should be distributed fairly among the licensed traders who purchased in 1916 from the. person who cleared under the authority * giveni     This condition was necessary.at the time in order to ensure the widest possible distribution of,the very limited quantity coming into consumption; and it was continued when the quantity to be released was increased last February to 75$ of the clearances in 1916 i3,   The result has been that although the total quantity for home consumption has been,increased, the case of that part of the populat--ion (which has largely increased since&apos;the Armistice) who before the war were in the habit of buying a bottle of spirits, has not.   -been met.     Further, there has been a strong tendency for the supplie. to find their..way into licensed premises and not to the private consumer owing to the extra profit which a publican is permitted to obtain by retailing spirits in small quantities rather than by the bottle.4,   In these circumstances, I propose that the quantity of spirits permitted to be released from bond should be increased by        on. the 1916 clearances for the period Oct. 1st., 1919 -to March 31st* 1920, and by a.like amount for each succeeding six-months so long as the present restrictions aro maintained.     I recommend that licensed traders should be restrict ed  to the allocations which they&quot; receive at present, and that the additional 2\$ should be distributed, by the trade among their private, customers.-    I am advised that this modified system of distribution will present no insuperable difficulties-ulties.5.   This measure will go a long way to meet the many undoubted cases of hardship existing at present.     It will further meet the demands which are- bound to be made for additional supplies to private con-sumers owing to the actual or possible recrudescence of influenza. I consider- it better to forestall these demands than to meet them later under pressure.        -6,   I should be glad to have the decision of the Cabinet upon my recommendation at the earliest possible date.fMINISTRY OF FOOD. .
