This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.ROYAL AIR FORCE ESTIMATES.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR.I circulate to my colleagues three separate schemes for the permanent maintenance of the Air Force which have been prepared during the last two months by Air-Marshal Trenchard in collaboration with General Seely, It is vital to all real progress in the future organization of the Air Force, and it is most important from the point of view of day-to-day economy, that a decision should be given by the Cabinet as to the general scale on which the Air Force is to be maintained. Until this is done there is really no guide which the Air Ministry, and the officers serving under it, can follow in deciding which aerodromes and establishments should be abolished and which they should concentrate upon. Although a great deal has been done in reduction, I am satisfied that expense will be avoided by an early decision on the main principle.Air-Marshal Trenchard attaches the greatest importance to Scheme &quot; B,&quot; and he seeks from the Cabinet an opportunity of submitting his reasons for it. I hope this may be accorded him.I wish to make it clear that the decision to adopt any one of the three schemes must not be held as binding the Air Ministry to the the details. These will greatly profit by I far more refined&apos; consideration and canvassing than has been possible while the scale remains purely hypothetical. I would suggest that the Cabinet should choose from these three schemes, and that the amount should be taken as the limit of future plans. The Air Ministry should then be free to make any better use of the money which a more searching study may suggest by varying the details and improving the apportionment. This does not mean that any large change in principle is contemplated, but it is probable that better value will be obtained after another two or three months&apos; work on the basis of a definite decision. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has latterly shown himself very ready to favour this method of dealing with the question, and I hope that the Cabinet will approve of a wide measure of discretion being accorded to the Air Ministry within the limits of the general decision.WINSTON S.

j h 0SECRETMemorandum on Air Force, Civil Aviation and Supply and Research Estimates for 1920-1921 and following years.1. In presenting these Estimates for consideration, I wish, to make it clear at the outset that they do not purport to give more than a general outline of the proposed organization. The total sum in each scheme may be taken as correct, but the figures are only approximate as between the cost of the various items. Kesearch or equipment, for instance, may require a little more or a little less money. These details can only be settled as the organization progresses.2. In coming to a decision as regards the general question of the future organization of the Koyal Air Force, there are two alternatives only [a.] To regard the Air Force simply as a means of conveyance captained by chauffeurs and carrying Army and Navy personnel, and to use it to carry out reconnaissance for the Army and Navy, to drop bombs at places specified by them immediately affecting their local operations and to observe for their artillery.(6.) To make a real Air Service which&apos; will encourage and develop airmanship, and more important still, engender an Air spirit, like the Naval spirit, and to create a force capable of influencing profoundly the strategy of the future.No compromise is workable. If we are not to relegate aviation to a minor position and lose that predominance which we have won at such cost during the last five years, we must create a real Air Service, not necesarily large, but highly efficient.3. The problem is not, in the first instance, one of how many service squadrons we require to&apos;meet strategical needs, as in the case of the Army, but one of making a. sound framework on which to build a Service in order to provide a number of service squadrons adequately trained and equipped. This depends on a proper balance between establish-ments for elementary training of officers and men, schools for higher training and service squadrons and the certainty that in the case of sudden emergency, such as might arise within the British Empire, the regular Air Service will be amply fed both with personnel and materiel from civilian sources.[a.) Elementary training must ensure the most thorough training of all ranks in the bed rock of their professional duties, that is, flying, and a good working technical knowledge in the case of the officer, and a real mastery of their trades in the case of the men. If we fall short of this training we are building on foundations of sand, and we are certain, in the opinion of those qualified to judge, to increase largely the number of flying accidents.&apos;(&amp;.). Schools for higher training are a necessity if the flying officer is to become something more than a mere chauffeur. Teehnisal experts are required for the development of the science of aeronautics, still in its infancy, and to enable the Air Force to play its part in peace and war. Navigation, pilotage, photography and wireless are primary necessities if the Air Force is to be more than a means of conveyance, and the first two are requisite for safety even on the chauffeur basis. If the Air Force does not train the experts, where are they to come from, and who is to do the work. ? Without a knowledge of gunnery the force cannot be a fighting machine, and, without a flying instructors school, the training of pilots in their first duty, namely, to fly, is bound to suffer. Again, it has been suggested that the Air Force should rely on the older Services to train its^cadets and staff officers.  To do so would make the creation of an Air spirit an impossibility.(c.) A certain number of service squadrons is essential, or the necessary stimulus to all ranks to render themselves really efficient will be lacking, and the opportunity of learning in the only true school, that of experience, will be lost.(d.) Without the expenditure of much more money than is likely to be sanctioned in peace time it can only be hoped to maintain an Air Service adequate to needs in the event of a sudden outbreak of war if there exists a reserve of personnel and craft normally engaged in commercial aviation, but available upon an emergency to supplement the regular Air Service.(7610) a
4. On the assumption that the latter alternative in paragraph 2 of the above will be adopted, even in the present financial pressure, the State cannot in my judgment afford to throw away what has been attained in the last five years, but must provide for-&apos; dhe consolidation- of that achievement and for- further ordered&apos; progress. I now submit three- draft schemes, A,: B and 0, for the future strength: and; distribution of the Force, and for the expense of civil aviation, supply and research, with estimates of the cost.5. (a.) Scheme A provides service squadrons, adequate machinery for the elementary and higher training of all&apos; ranks, including&apos; reserves, and. the personnel and material required on mobilization.(&amp;.) Scheme B provides service squadrons available for small wars in tlie British Empire, and also provides the minimum necessary for training, but some of the least: indispensable schools have been eliminated. Its weakness lies in the tact that it does not provide material or personnel for mobilization, or any system of Territorials, or for the training of a Reserve. Under this scheme, however, with slight modifications but no extra expense, it should be possible to meet in full the probable wastage of one of our small wars.(c.) Scheme C provides fewer service squadrons available for small wars. It has the defects of Scheme B in that it does not provide any machinery for&apos; mobilization, or any system of Territorials, or for the training of a Reserve. It has- additional defects in that it makes no provision for meeting any sudden call of war wastage, even for a small war, and reduces the number of squadrons for work with the Navy, including those for overseas bases, to a-dangerously low figure.In Schemes A and B sums of 1,000,000?. and 2,000,000?. respectively are provided for civil aviation and supply and research; in Scheme C sums of 1,000,000?. and 1,500,000?.6. The cost of the three schemes respectively is shown in detail in the. estimates-attached to each scheme, and. is as follows : Scheme	No. of Squadrons.		Cost.

Equipment) under each scheme is not due to an increase in programme, but to the fact that, in the earlier years, it is anticipated that it will be possible to utilize existing stocks of machines, engines, &amp;c. To some extent the increased provision required under this Vote, as stocks become exhausted or unserviceable, is set off by a reduction in the amount required under &quot;Vote 4 (Works and Lands), it being anticipated that the programme for the reconstruction of temporary buildings on a permanent basis and for the purchase of lands will be mainly carried out in the earlier years.
7. I have provided the sum of 1,000,000/, in all three schemes for expenses of civil aviation. &apos; The amount pressed for by the Controller-General of Civil Aviation is 2,000,000/., and I cannot but admit that there is very strong reason for ihis view. We are here working in a sphere where precise estimates of requirements are difficult. But it is a sphere where we cannot afford to take any avoidable risk, for the reason that at present we must look largely to the activities of the civil aviation side to provide reserves of machines and men for the Service side and to develop a policy which will enable the industry of the country to be ready,- as far as may be, to meet emergency requirements. I am impressed by the fact that in this sphere, though our organization is superior, we are being left seriously behind by other countries owing to less financial assistance being provided. In framing a policy of air routes, in developing the routes, in providing for the adjuncts to such routes by way of improved meteorological and wireless organization, in devising ways of helping industry to tide over the present critical period, there is a mass of work for the Department of Civil Aviation, which necessitates that the most liberal provision possible be made for it, and I am confident that the provision of 2,000,000/. considered necessary by the Controller-General of Civil Aviation would be well spent. I would add that increase here would also find strong support among the public. It should not be forgotten that Civil Aviation is already a revenue earning department in a small way, and,, that such revenue will in the ordinary course of events increase as time goes on.I would strongly emphasize the fact, that unless an adequate sum is allotted to this department, sufficient, in fact, to enable it to afford real assistance (not] necessarily directly financial) to the aircraft industry at this period of transition, that industry will almost certainly become atrophied and a time must come later when, in the interests of the State, it will have to be resuscitated at great cost and heavily handicapped as against foreign competitors whose aircraft industries will be firmly established.8. I draw special attention to the following observations on the schemes :-(a.) In none of them is provision made for the cost of liquidating war contracts or for winding up other war expenditure remaining after 31st March, 1920. Further they do not make full provision for the expenses.of aircraft supply . organization ; how far the Air Force estimates- should provide for this last liability is a point which cannot be settled pending a decision by the Prime Minister on the proposals approved some months ago by the War Cabinet, subject to ratification by the Prime Minister, for a division of responsibility between the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Supply. The additional money required, estimated at, say, 200,000/., will have to be provided on the estimates of one or the other Ministry.(b.) Under Scheme C the amount provided for research has been reduced by 500,000/. Steady and interrupted progress in research is vital to the future of aviation, both service and civil, and I view any curtailment of provision for it with extreme concern. The most serious present result of this reduction would be the stoppage of provision of airships as well as interruption of development in that sphere. That work, at all events, I think should go on, and in order to allow it to do so, I think that an additional sum of 350,000/. should be provided in 1920-1921 on the basis of Scheme C. Should the transaction for the sale of K. 38 to the American navy, referred to in a separate paper put forward to the Cabinet, be approved by them and carried out, there will be an appropriation in aid of 400,000/., which will more than cover the increase of 350,000/.9. t would press most strongly for an early Cabinet decision as regards the total sum to be allotted for the Air Service and for civil aviation and supply and research in the next financial year 1920-21.Apart from the danger on the Service side, unless such a decision is given at once, of committing the Government to a larger sum than they may be eventually allowed, the present uncertainty inevitably results in unnecessary expenditure and waste. It is not possible to declare equipment surplus, which may be needed or to vacate stations until it is definitely known whether they will or will not be requited on a peace basis. This difficulty is, of course, common to all three of the fighting Services, but in the case of the Air Force there is a still further difficulty not felt in the case of the Army and Navy. Lhe Air Force is to all intents and purposes a war creation, and has no pre-war organization to which to return, no peace establishment, no barracks, no administra-tive services.   It is urgently necessary to frame a peace organization, so that we may(7010) A 2
build on a sound plan. This is the work of many months, entailing a mass of careful organization, but.it is impossible to embark on it in any detail till an approximate figure is given of the total sum which can be made available. In addition, L would ask that when that sum has been decided, I may be given wide discretion as regards the details of the organization, and as to the allocation of the total sum between the service and the civil sides and supply and research.Scheme A.Forecast&apos;of the Estimates 1920-24.Vote.	*              Service.	1920-21.	1921-22.	1922-23.	&apos; 1923-24.		 	 	 	    .1	Pay,   allowances,   &amp;cs!

The estimate for Vote 3, Technical Equipment, is conditional on present types remaining unchanged. If the types are changed additional charges will be incurred to build up a reserve. The provision under this Vote is somewhat problematical; the peace rates of consumption of various types of stores are not known, and certain services not provided for may have to be substituted for services for which provision has been made.3.
