(THIS SQCUMT IS TH? rROPKRTV OF HIS BRITATOC MAJF3TV1 B 5QVH^&apos;NT) * rG.T, 8334.WAR CA3IH1T.GOV^RM^UT ADVERTISING. (Memorandum from the Treasury.)in 1917, in consequence of various complaints made by representatives of the press as to the distribution r\f Government advertisements amongst newspapers, the Treasury constituted a Committee composed ofSir George Riddell Sir James Boyton. Mr. J.S. Higham. &apos; Mr. Frank Bird, Mr. John Mudie ana E.J.P. Benn.The committee^ terms of reference were as follows&quot;To advise the- Controller of His Majesty1 s Stationery Offioe as to the newspapers in Y.hich Government adve-rtise-Reinforcements, fcr the placing of whioh the Controller is responsible, ,should be inserted with a view to securing the necessary publicity&apos;for each particular class of advertisement with due regard to economy, and avoid-any selection of papers for merely political or personal reasons.&quot;On grounds of efficiency and economy it ia, in the view of the Treasury:; essential to centralise all&apos;advertising on the part of Government Departments in the hands&apos;of the Stationery Office, as this is the Government Department which, with the assistance of the Advisory committee above referred to, is in the best position to cope with the technical questions arising in connection with advertising and to secure, by means of a contract, that the Government gets its work done on the mo3t favourable terms.During the last couple cf years,- however, various Govern-ment Departments have undertaken to place their own advertise-ments independently of the stationery office and it is alleged that&apos;considerable sums cf money have thereby been lost as. the terms obtained were not&apos;as favourable as the Stationery Office could have secured under contract entered into by them with an agent for advertising.   It has &quot;been represented that the action of Departments in this matter has been mainly due to the fact that the stationery office Agent-Contractors, Messrs. J. Willing, Limited, were unable to furnish expert advice in respect ,of preparation of copy for adVertisments and in the art of display;   There is no doubt that there is some foundation for this view as regards the capacity of Messrs. Tilling and notice- has now been given them to terminate their contract.   Fresh tenders have been obtained from firms to enter into a contract as agents for Government advertising, and it is proposed to select four of these firms, and to divide the work between them.   An important condition in each contract will be that the Contractor will provide, when required, the services of an expert in the art of display and copy-writing of advertisements and of formulating and carrying dut special publicity schemes.
*i k*The Treasury arc of opinion that, when ,G ore ram en t Agents for advertising arc appointed under contracts containing these terms, there should &quot;be no justification for not employ- ... ing them ,on all Government advertising and publicity work in the press *   it is. therefore, sug rested that the \&apos;rar Cabinet should make a ruling x&apos;y(1)   That all advertising and publicity work required by Government Departments should be carried out through., the Stationery Office and its Agents and:-(S)   That, if any exceptional oase arises where,, for some special reason, a Department does net desire to utilise the Government Agents, the precedent sanction cf the Treasury should be obtained for placing advertisements etc., other-wise than through them.Treasury, s.w,15th October, 1919,
