Military Secret.1129fThis Document Is the Property of His tintanni- Mrijsst/s -Govenvnerr&apos;5From Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India22nd October 1919.(Repeated to Teheran and Constantinople.)(Received 24th.) 14339.   22nd October.   Malieson wires 19th October :-&quot;Shortly before his departure on 24th September with the Afghan Mission to Moscow, Kazim Beg gave an interview &quot;to a Turki paper of Tashkent called The Communist, I have now received copy of same. In it Kazim Beg declares that visit of Shall to Europe under British compulsion was significant move designed to show that there was no complete solidity in Mahometan world on question of Holy War against the British. Speaking of Bokhara he regretted Amir had disregarded his advice and submitted to British guidance. The Chief Kazi and Mull as of Bokhara had also sold their country for British gold and remained cynically in-different to the destruction of the Kaabah of Medina and of Constantinople. The Mullahs of Bokhara have so far succumbed to British intrigues as to denounce eminent Turks who are recognised servants of religion and humanity (Enver Pasha, Kazim Beg, &amp;c.). When I first met the Amir 1 regarded him as an intelligent and broad-minded man. But nine months of close observation have convinced me that he has completely submitted to British blandishments. My advice now falls on deaf ears. But the time for repentance is close at hand. If Bokhara fails to come into line Red Guards will adjust matters to our liking. As regards Afghanistan, Amir Amanulla, taking advantage of the golden opportunity, lias won his rights at the point of the sword, and by achieving independence has enormously increased his prestige and power, and that of Afghanistan, throughout Asia and the whole Mahometan world. That country is now a real Power for the British to recognise. Its geographical, military and economic situation is such as to make the Soviet Government of Russia strain every nerve to establish the most intimate alliance with it, and to assist it in every way with a view to compassing the downfall of the British power in Asia and indeed throughout the world.&quot;
