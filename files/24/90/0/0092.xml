jSECRET.4MINISTEY  OF   FOOD,Report for Month ending 15th October 1919,PART I.-ACTION TAKEN.Distribution and Transport of Foodstuffs during the Railway Strike.1. During the continuance of the strike, daily reports were, on the instructions of the Prime Minister, sent by the Food Controller to the War Cabinet on the general position of the supply, distribution and transport of foodstuffs, and particularly the state of stocks at the ports and in the hands of wholesalers and retailers throughout the country. These memoranda were supplemented from time to time by other reports upon specific points, upon which the Cabinet required information or recommendations.The purpose of the present report is to summarise and bring up to date these memoranda with a view to setting out as complete a statement as possible of the work carried out by the Ministry of Food during the strike. It is not possible to include ,in the report full particulars, figures showing quantities of foodstuffs moved, &amp;c, in the various parts of the country, since the statements on the subject, which are being prepared by Divisional Food Commissioners, have not yet been completed.2. Emergency measures for the supply and distribution of foodstuffs were considered during the war for the purpose of meeting any dislocation of transport which might become inevitable. During the period of serious industrial unrest at the beginning of the present year, these arrangements were revised and have since then been kept up to date&apos;. The transfer to the Ministry of Food, of the organisation set up by the Road Transport Board facilitated the formation of schemes for substituting transport.3. The measures in contemplation by the Ministry fell roughly under three(a) The delegation of considerable powers to Local Authorities, i.e., Local Food Control Committees working through Divisional Food Commissioners.(5) The movement of stocks through the ports to inland centres, and the encouragement given to wholesalers and retailers to hold unusually large stocks of goods.(c) The elaboration of a complete system of road transport.4. Delegation of Powers. It was always recognised that the functions of Local Authorities, * which contributed very largely to the success of rationing, must be considerably increased in any emergency such as this; and for some months Divisional Food Commissioners had been in possession of instructions, which were modified from time to time in order to keep them up to date, as to the general lines of action which they should follow in case of need. They were accordingly given and exercised very wide powers of restricting consumption by schemes of local rationing, of fixing maximum prices in the case of uncontrolled foods, and of requisitioning supplies in order to secure equality of distribution. Divisional Commissioners were also instructed to prepare and have ready for issue immediately upon the declaration of a strike detailed instructions to the Local Food Committees in their area, relating, e.g., to the supply, conservation, transport, protection of foodstuffs, &amp;c.These arrangements worked well. No complaints were received of any excessive run upon shops or of the formation of queues, such as occurred in January 1918. The retail shop-keepers, further, rendered every assistance in their power to prevent any undue depletion of their stocks.5. Transfer of Stocks. Tn the case of most foodstuffs retailers held from ten to fourteen days&apos;supply, and in the case of rationed foods, such as sugar and butter, the reduction in the ration put into effect by the Ministry at once operated to increase this proportionately.   Moreover, steps had already been taken to deposit at suitableA  (33)9121  Pk 16  140   10/19 E &amp; S Aheads: 
points inland emergency stocks of flour, canned meat, canned salmon, and condensed milk, in order to form an immediate reserve at the disposal of Divisional Food Commissioners in case transport difficulties became acute. In fact, however, it was not necessary to draw on these artificial reserves.6. System of Boad Transport. In July last was decided that the functions of the Road Transport Board should be transferred to the Ministry of Food ; this transfer took place as from July 21st. The Divisional Transport Boards, Area Transport Committees, and Divisional Committees which had previously existed were disbanded, and such of the staff as were still required were placed under Divisional Food Commissioners. Instructions were, at the same time, issued to Commissioners that they must take immediate steps to ensure that the Road Transport Organisation in their Division was put upon an effective and reliable basis, and that, in particular, they must take proper action to ensure that adequate registers were prepared of vehicles, motor and horse-drawn, which could be requisitioned in case of need, and also under-take arrangements for the registration of volunteer drivers.Commissioners had therefore prepared, with the assistance of records which were already existing in a more or less complete form in the hands of Local Authorities,, a register of all petrol, steam and electrically driven, and horse vehicles in each Division and of drivers who would be available for service when required ; and when the strike broke out they were able to put these facilities, together with motor lorries supplied by the Government, at the disposal of traders in their Divisions for the conveyance of foodstuffs. For the purpose of organisation the country had been carefully mapped out and the routes to be used in the case of distant carriage laid down. The transport required in each divisional area had been estimated, and traders and others requiring road transport, other than that within their own control, made application to their Divisional Transport Officer who drew on the divisional &quot;pool&quot;, and where necessary made application to headquarters. The main task of the staff at headquarters was to arrange for long distance convoys on the basis of a scheme previously drawn up, or as occasion required. As an illustration of the magnitude of the task, 200 officers were occupied in the requisition of transport in London.It is as yet impossible to state in any detail the quantity of goods borne by road transport, but provisional figures show that the quantity was over 150,000 tons in addition to the number of churns carried for the London milk supply. These numbered in round figures 40,000, each of which weighed two hundredweight when full; and the empty churns had to be carried back.The carriage undertaken by the Transport branch included hay for the horses in the London area, convoys for this purpose being dispatched as far as Lincolnshire.Orders issued by the Food Controller during the Strike.The Divisional Food Commissioners (Emergency Powers) Order, 1919. This Order was issued on September 27th. Its effect was, by declaring that a state of emergency existed, to put into force the provisions of the Road Transport (Requisition) Order, 1919, under which the Food Controller, or Divisional Food Commissioners, or persons authorised by them, might take possession of all horses and road vehicles in use, or capable of being used, for the transport of goods by road with certain exceptions.Under a further Divisional Food Commissions (Emergency Powers) Order also made on September 27th, the Food Commissioners were authorised to fix maximum prices, or vary maximum prices already in force.The Public Meals Order, 1919, dated September 27th, restricted the use and con-sumption of flour, milk, butchers&apos; meat, sugar and bread in public eating-houses.The Food Hoarding (Amendment) Order, 1919, dated September 27th, under which no person might acquire any article of food so that the quantity of such article at one time exceeded that requiredfor ordinary use and consumption in his household or establishment during a period of seven days.Directions under the Bationing Order, issued on September 27th, by which the weekly ration of butter was reduced to 1 ounce, of sugar to 6 ounces and of butchers&apos; meat to 20 pennyworth.
The Veal (Restriction of Sales) Order, 1919, was revoked on September 29th. The effect of the revocation is that veal may be sold retail for human consumption.The Sugar (Returns) Order, 1919, dated September 29th, by which information as to stocks of sugar was required.The Cake and Pastry Order, 1919, dated September 30th, by which the sale of fancy articles of pastry was prohibited.The Margarine (Restriction) Order, 1919, dated September 30th, by which no margarine was to be used in manufacture until further notice.The Vegetable (Prices) Emergency Order, 1919, dated October 7th, This Order fixed maximum prices for potatoes and other essential vegetables,Action taken in respect of the more important Foodstuffs.Meat. The existing organisation for distribution working on normal lines, proved itself fully equal to meeting the additional strain thrown upon it by the strike.. It was fortunate, however, that the strike came at a time when the demand for meat could be satisfied by home-grown supplies to a greater extent than at any other time in the year. As a result of this, the necessity for the transport of dead meat was reduced to a minimum. The Live Stock Commissioners were left with full discretion to transfer surpluses of live stock from markets to centres where the meat was required, and for the first time for two generations cattle were walked on the hoof 40 or 50 miles, and occasionally further ; full preparations had been made for the movement of cattle and sheep in droves to the London markets from Norfolk and neighbouring counties. New emergency markets were established and arrangements were made permitting slaughtering under a temporary licence at other than the usual slaughter-houses. If the strike had occurred at some other season of the year the demands upon emergency transport would have been more heavy; but it may be noted that even during the week of the strike the distribution to traders of imported meat amounted to 7,035 tons or nearly double the quantity distributed during the whole of October .1918. Distribution of this quantity was facilitated by the fact that stocks were available in all the principal centres of distribution, and stocks at ports adjoining certain large industrial districts were replenished by the diversion of steamers direct to those ports. Distribution from the ports was mainly carried out by motor transport, of which a material proportion was provided by the trade.Under the ordinary distribution arrangements, buyers are grouped together and allocations of meat are made upon permits providing their proper allowance to each group, the permits being made available at nominated markets in or near the district concerned. This system of bulk allocation considerably facilitated arrangements for distribution during the emergency.Bread and Flour. At the beginning of the strike the average stocks in the hands of bakers and retailers of flour amounted to approximately two weeks&apos; supply. During the succeeding week stocks were replenished, and at the end of the strike the stocks amounted to nearly the figure at which they stood at the beginning. In normal times, flour is moved, largely, by road and in some areas, notably London, almost entirely so. Millers and factors, however, have not in all cases sufficient road transport at their disposal to enable them to maintain a full ordinary distribution. Their demands for additional transport were, however, met without any difficulty, with the result that the mills generally were able to distribute a very large percentage of their output. In the London and Hull areas nearly the whole output was distributed.When the strike began, the Government reserve stock of flour in the ports was not distributed as evenly as could be wished; the cause of this is the fact that flour arrives largely by liners from North America which only discharge at certain ports, the chief of which are Liverpool and Glasgow. Distribution was, however, re-arranged after a few days; for example, steps were taken to transfer by coastal steamers 10,000 tons from Glasgow to Bristol, 5,000 tons from Glasgow to London, 5,000 tons from Leith to Hull, and 5,000 from Leith to London, &amp;c. Steamers were diverted from Manchester to London, and in case the emergency continued, cable instructions were sent to New York to load tramp steamers for Bristol and London.Special arrangements were made for the distribution of yeast. Supplies come mainly from Scotland and Ireland. The yeast was brought by Admiralty ships from the ports in Scotland and Ireland where the distilleries are situated, to ports all round
the coast. From these ships it was conveyed inland in bulk by road transport to special distributing centres. From these centres it was transported by light Ford vans throughout the country. Owing to bad weather some supplies were delayed, but the shortage was made good in time, and when the strike ceased the distribution was proceeding quite satisfactorily.Milk.-The plans for the motor transport of milk from the producing districts of London and the other large urban centres, which had already been prepared in anticipation of a strike, worked smoothly. They were further assisted by the fact that after the first day or two a certain amount of milk arrived by rail, although this possibility had been disregarded ; from October 2nd onwards, London received about two-thirds of its supply by rail and one-third by motor service. Owing to the con-tinuous improvement in the railway position it was possible for London to receive, after the first few days of the strike, 75 per cent, of its normal supply, while the programme of motor transport to Hyde Park aimed only at 60 per cent, when in full working order. London&apos;s normal supply is about 255,000 gallons per day, and the daily arrival during the latter part of the strike was about 190,000 gallons.. The arrangements for distribution resembled the pooling systems which were set up last winter when milk supplies were short. A Committee of representative wholesale dealers, working in co-operation with officers of the Ministry, allocated in the small hours of each morning the fair proportions of the quantities which had arrived whether by rail or road to all the dealers, on a basis which had been arrived at by a system of returns of sales obtained in the last week of August.On Monday, September 29th, 6,000 churns, or 40 per cent, of the normal supply arrived in London. On October 1st this rose to 65 per cent., and on October 2nd and subsequent days to 75 percent. The total quantity of milk moved by motor and train service during the nine days of the strike was about 92,000 churns or 1,564,000 gallons. Further, arrangements were made to place about two days&apos; supply of milk in cold store in London before the strike broke out; this supply effectively bridged the gap before the motor transport system was fully developed.Supplies in the provinces were everywhere well maintained and in some parts were in excess of the demand. Organisation of road transport by the Food Commissioners met the difficulties in the large towns, and in the rural areas the problem was one of surplus not of deficiency. Reports received daily from the Food Commissioners showed that throughout the country the situation was adequately met and even in some of the large towns surpluses appeared towards the end of the strike. To meet the difficulty of the surpluses in milk-producing districts brought about by the reduced transport, Commissioners were instructed at the beginning of the strike that all such surpluses should be sent to cheese or condensed milk factories so as to avoid as far as possible any waste of milk.At the outbreak of the strike, the Food Commissioners were instructed to arrange with. Food Committees for the preparation of priority schemes under which preference would be given to invalids and children in the event of a shortage. It was found, how-ever, after the first few days that the machinery of emergency transport and distri-bution were working adequately and no real need for these priority arrangements arose.Condensed and Dried Milk. When control of condensed milk was removed last spring, traders were invited to safeguard the supply position by entering upon a large importing and manufacturing programme and to distribute stocks widely throughout the country. As a result, when the strike began, there was in the country between four and five months&apos; supply at the normal rate of consumption of 600,000 cases per month. There was between two and three weeks&apos; normal supply in all retail shops. After the first day, and largely owing to the care exercised by the retailer, no excessive sales took place.During the strike, stocks in the shops were replenished as it was felt that con-densed milk formed a valuable reserve, not only for liquid milk, but also as a second line of defence in the event of a shortage of other commodities.Dried milk is an important article from the point of view of the requirements of infant welfare centres which use about 100 tons per month ; when the strike broke out there were sufficient supplies in the country for three or four months&apos; requirements. During the first six days of October, motor lorries distributed nearly 90,000 packages from London to about 100 infant welfare centres through the country, i.e., sufficient for a fortnights consumption.
Butter. There were about 13,000 tons of butter in the country when the strike began; and since the weekly requirements of the country on the ration of \\ ozs. are about 1,700 tons, there was held by the Ministry at the various depots about eight weeks&apos; supply.   There was about one week&apos;s supply in the retail shops.Supplies were replenished first by the reduction in the ration to 1 oz. per head per week, and the cutting oft&apos; of supplies to catering establishments, and secondly, by arrangements for an emergency distribution of butter. This distribution, sufficient to last for three weeks on the one-ounce basis, was set in motion through the ordinary trade channels, the distributors being instructed, when they could not utilize rail or their own transport, to obtain special transport from the Food Commissioners. The quantity moving under this emergency distribution was about 3,500 tons, and despite the interruption occasioned by the strike the new supplies were reaching the ships with almost normal regularity.Cheese. Distribution of about 75 per cent, of normal requirements had been released about ten days before the strike, and had, therefore, in most cases, just reached the retail shops ; this amounted to between two and three weeks&apos; supply on the basis of normal consumption. Further, the Ministry held in its various stores and warehouses about 7,000 tons of imported cheese, and 9,000 tons of home cheese over and above the quantities already in traders hands were at their disposal in factor&apos;s warehouses or on farms at the call of factors.It Avas, however, felt desirable to strengthen the position by releasing a further distribution, since cheese is a valuable article of diet which lends itself to various forms of consumption, and might, in an emergency, be bought by many people who in the ordinary course do not buy cheese at all. A distribution was accordingly made on September 29th, of 100 per cent, of normal monthly requirements. The quantity moved successfully under this emergency arrangement was about 13,000 tons.This special distribution, which was larger than usual, and was antedated by about two weeks, has caused a certain depletion of the Ministry&apos;s stocks. This, however, is not serious as the Ministry has large supplies in hand and in prospect, and to safeguard the position a further quantity of Canadian cheese is being purchased. Moreover, factories considerably increased their output of cheese during the strike as they were instructed to use in this way the surplus supplies of milk which had necessarily accumulated in the producing districts owing to difficulties of transport to the urban centres.Margarine. The scheme for the distribution of margarine in an emergency had been prepared some months before the strike. Quotas had been calculated for each Food Commissioners Division on the basis of a 4-oz. ration per head per week for the population. Each Commissioner was informed of the quota for his Division and of the factory or factories from which it should be drawn ; and he was, therefore, able, before the strike, to prepare detailed arrangements for transport from the factory to his Division and locally within the Division. No Division was short of supplies during the strike, and, in fact, when it ended some areas had greater supplies than were required owing to the amount which found its way through the usual trade channels, the breakdown of ordinary transport not being so serious as had been expected.Certain difficulties were caused owing to the fact that certain factories were not prepared to supply at the price which it was necessary to fix. A method was, however, speedily improvised by which Commissioners were able to obtain supplies at prices agreed between the Ministry and the Trade. Delay was only caused in one case, the Northern Division, in which, owing to negotiations as to the price to be paid it proved impossible to arrange immediate transport from the factory near Manchester from which supplies were to be sent.Sugar. So far as sugar is concerned, the strike began at a most unfavourable moment owing to the fact that there had been a serious delay on the railways for some weeks beforehand, and the distribution of supplies to traders for September had not been completed. It was, however, practically certain that most retailers had supplies for between one and two weeks. In order to conserve supplies so far as possible, the weekly ration was reduced from 12 ozs. to 6 ozs. per head.Apart from the stock of sugar in the hands of traders, there were two sources from which supplies could be drawn, viz., the refined sugar held at the refineries, which was equal to about three weeks&apos; supply, and the raw sugar stock which wasA3
very large. The sugar refineries are concentrated in London (three), Liverpool (four), and Greenock (five), and hold about 25,000 tons of refined sugar. A distribution scheme was improvised under which a committee of traders was set up at each of these three places to deal with all questions of sugar clearances and distribution. These committees arranged, so far as possible, for their own transport, without reference to the Ministry of Food, and only applied to the Ministry when this could not be clone; their demands were met without difficulty. It is probable that these committees will remain in existence for a short time until distribution is again upon an entirely normal footing.During the first few days of the strike, some difficulty was caused by the requisitioning by Divisional Food Commissioners of supplies in their area which were required for other parts of the country. These were, however, adjusted in a short time.Bacon, Stocks in the hands of wholesalers and retailers at the beginning of the strike were fairly good, and the chief immediate difficulty was not so much the replenishment of stocks, as the possibility of uneven distribution. In order to over-come this, Divisional Food Commissioners were authorised, where necessary, to arrange a system for pooling wholesalers stocks within their Divisions, and Local Food Com-mittees were similarly authorised to pool retailers stocks in their districts. Some anxiety was caused in the case of two areas in particular where traders have never been in the habit of carrying large stocks, viz., the industrial Midlands, ranging between Birmingham and Sheffield, and the Newcasfcle-on-Tyne area. The former district was kept supplied by issues from local stores until a train could be run from Liverpool to Birmingham, and in some cases motor transport was run from. Manchester to other centres in the area. The difficulty in supplying the Newcastle area was due to the doubt whether it was safe to run a special train into Newcastle; in this area alone it was necessary for a time to fall back on reserve stores.As regards the replenishment of wholesalers and retailers stocks, the usual allotments were made to the importers who used their own means of transport to the greatest extent possible and applied to the appropriate local transport officer where necessary. Wholesalers took similar action in regard to the replenishment of retailers stocks. In order to accelerate delivery and to encourage traders to get the supplies moving, some special concessions were made as to terms of transport. &apos; These measures were to a large extent successful in keeping up stocks and also in helping to clear the quays.Tea. Immediately upon the declaration of the strike, arrangements were made to form a Tea Clearing House Committee. This Committee drew up a list of all orders in hand over the whole country in two classes, viz., the amount of blended tea actually in the dealers&apos; warehouses, and the amount of tea in bond on which duty was paid, which had not been cleared. There was, therefore, a complete list of stocks-ready for immediate delivery so that if tea were required urgently in any particular district, it could be forwarded at short notice.Arrangements were made with the trade for the execution of orders by coastwise traffic so far as this was available and suitable.Speaking generally, the country was so well stocked with tea that there were no emergency calls except from Leicester; this call was immediately met by the issues of supplies by train.The organisation of the Tea Clearing House will be kept in being so that the necessary information may be available in the event of a similar emergency in the future.Potatoes. The two problems to be met on the outbreak of the strike were the maintenance of supplies to the consuming centres and prevention of any undue increase in price owing to the scarcity.Very small stocks of a perishable commodity such as potatoes are usually held in the large consuming centres, and it was therefore necessary for transport immediately to be arranged. The strike occurred at a time of year when stocks of potatoes are held on farms throughout the country, and the transport problem was not therefore difficult. Road transport is, however, uneconomic in the case of London and South. Wales, which are relatively distant from the producing centres ; arrangements were accordingly made to charter vessels to carry potatoes to these districts ; those to London came mainly from Scotland, and those to South Wales and Lancashire mainly from Ireland.   Further, after October 2nd regular potato trains were running to
PART II.-SUMMARY.From the detailed accounts given above of the supplies and distribution of each of the more essential foods, some general idea can be formed of the methods whereby the community was fed during the strike. Broadly speaking the operations of the Ministry are presented in three phases. The first need which had to be met at once, was to secure the supply of those commodities which owing to their nature are not stored, at any rate to any considerable extent. The most important of these are milk, home-killed meat, fish, potatoes and yeast. The problem was one of transport and the means adopted display on the one hand a reversion to earlier times when herds of cattle walked to the market in the charge of drovers, and on the other hand the utilization of recent invention with destroyers flitting round the coasts with yeast, and motor cars and lorries traversing the highways. After the first two or three days and especially as coast services and an improvised service of trains came into use, a definite and closely knit system of transport was developed which ensured adequate and constant supplies of even the more perishable articles of food. Articles which are normally stocked present two phases. The retail stocks, as has been explained, were heavier than usual. What was most to be feared was a panic rush on the shops, This was averted partly by the warnings and orders of the Ministry, partly by the attitude of the shopkeepers, and partly by the good sense of the public ; moreover, the reduction of the ration in the case of certain rationed foods had an effect in repressing undue consumption and so extending the period for which the retail stocks were sufficient. In the next place the replenishment of such stocks was necessary and this was carried out with remarkable efficiency in the case of most articles. As can be seen both from the detailed descriptions given above and from the tables annexed where estimates of retail stock are stated, the shop stocks underwent comparatively little change except in the case of sugar and bacon; and in both these cases replenishment was being arranged.The Statistical Tables (A) which follow set out the main stocks of the country, those held, that is, in the granaries, mills, and cold stores and the warehouses of importers and larger wholesalers, on four different dates, namely, September 1st, September 27th or 29th, October 1st and October 4th or 6th according to the class of commodity, those taken during the strike being taken by telegraph for the sake of rapidity.   From them it will be seen how well the main stocks were kept up, evenA   9121 A london from Cambridgeshire and Lincolnshire. As a result, the supplies in London and other large centres were considerably greater at the conclusion of the strike than during the last two or three months.In anticipation of a shortage of supplies, prices of potatoes and other vegetables rose very rapidly during the first day or two of the strike. This was countered by the issue of an order fixing maximum prices for these vegetables with a view to preventing panic buying. , .Fish. Immediate steps were taken to obtain information from the fishing ports of the minimum number of trawlers which it was essential should be kept going, the daily supplies of coal required and the ports at which the vessels would require to bunker. At the .same time particulars were supplied by Divisional Food Oommis-sioners of the quantities of fresh fish which could be absorbed in each division, the most convenient markets to which supplies could be sent, and the ports from which supplies could most easily be drawn. It was thus possible to establish and maintain supervision, not only of the distribution of fish in the various areas, but also, by means of the arrangements for supplying coal, of supplies at the ports. Through the whole of the strike distribution took place through the usual trade channels.The two main difficulties were to ensure adequate supplies of coal, and to secure transport from ports to the markets. The former was met with the active co-operation of the Coal Controller ; the latter by the provision by the Admiralty of sea carriers, which brought supplies from Yarmouth and Lowestoft to Billingsgate, and by the emergency motor transport arrangements. By October 3rd, the daily supply of fish I coming into Billingsgate was larger by 80 tons than the average daily supplies coming in before the strike.
while replenishment was going on. It must be borne in mind that the main stocks in question, while they include, are not restricted to stocks belonging to the Ministry. The stock in the hands of smaller wholesalers forms an item by no means negligible in the case 6f certain articles : it is probable that these, though their amount is not known, underwent some diminution. The estimates of the retail stocks have been referred to already. Equally interesting are the Tables (B, C, D), showing the supplies of flour, home-killed meat and fish. One other feature deserves notice, the large stores of canned meat, canned fish and condensed milk, which were regarded as a reserve, were little drawn upon.
