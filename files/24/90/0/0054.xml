THE KCJSIdG PROBLEM.,Memorandum by tho Chancellor of the Exchequer.I. am much concerned with the serious prospects of our building, programme.     The Minister of Labour in a. memorandum i-Jo. G.I. 8272 has called.attention to some of the dangers to which v;e ere- exposed,, and suggests as a remedy complete control of the building industry and allied trades.     I doubt whether Parliament would consent to the establishment of a new control of so -extensive a character, but, even if Parliament consented, I find it difficult to believe that we shall ever get -cut of our troubles by such a method.     The more controls we have and the longer they continue, the more difficult it becomes for trade to resume its natural course, ar&apos;&apos; whatever reductions may be made in particular charge &apos; the&apos; tendency of control, with its enspeotions, restrictions, licences and other hindrances to business, must he to   &apos; increase costs .Again it appears to me that control could not be effective unless it extended to ,tne use of existing buildings and the prevention of any attempt to turn existing housing accommodation to other purposes;   ncr can we expect that at the present time the Trade Unions would, in consideration of the. Government control and the object for which it was exercised, consent to waive any of their trade rules or customs which interfere with production.     Even during the Far this ro-suljp was only partially achieved in consideration of the special limitation of profits enforced upon the controlled firms, and this limitation&apos;itself was ineffective because of the concessions which it was necessary to make to induce  . capital to embark on the new business and extensions that were required,I cannot, therefore,, think that the control suggested would be effective;   what other s&amp;eps we can take it is more difficult to say, tout I think that the&apos; country ought to toe plainly told that the whole progress and success of the. housing policy is jeopardised by the existing condition of affairs, more particularly by the raising of costs and the restricted output,   &quot;Even allowing for the large Government subsidy, I understand that.local Urban Authorities calculate that they will have to charge&apos; rentals as high as 17/- and 18/-.     It Is not to be       &apos; expected that the working class can.or&quot;will pay. such rents. Whether everything possible is being done to -the Ministry of Health, not merely to permit, tout to foster and encourage other and cheaper methods of building,&quot; I do not know, but it seems clear that every effort ought to beImad e
made to find new and cheaper forms of construction, whether in pise de torre or wood or concrete bricks, where the necessary materials ore or can be made available.     It has also been suggested to me that more might be done in tho adaptation and improvement of existing accommodation. Apart from such measures as these I fear.that it would be . impossible to carry-out our programme, and that for financial reasons we shall be obliged to postpone its execution till more reasonable conditions prevail.(Intd.) A.0..reasury,16th October, 1919-.
