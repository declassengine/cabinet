SECRSTDIRESCTQIMB Off jjVgJMgMM (Home Office)1 7&quot;).SpeoiaX Keport l\o. 113ootland House, sj.W.1.Uth October, 1919(Circulated by the Home seoretaryjRUSSIANote(During the last few days many rumours of a conflicting oharaoter have been in circulation with regard to the politioal situation in Russia and reports have appeared in the press to the effeot that Lenin has been ousted from power by the more extreme section of the Bolsheviks. Although it is quite possible that disturbances have ocourred in Mosoow and that internal disuenoions have broken out among the Bolsheviks, it would be unwise to attaoh too much oredence to thope reports until they reoeive definite confirmation.)!Ehe Bolshevik Government still continues in power, but its sphere of influenoe in Russia is gradually deorf^Hing and there are not wanting signs that its end is within measurable distance,   Tho Communists, who are nearly a?.l either Jews or Letts, are a Minority even in the largotowns, and maintain themselves in power by terror.    (Ehe vast majority of the population is opposed to communism, and is thoroughly tired of the corrupt and utterly inefficient rule of the Bolshevik &quot;Commissaries, but apathy due to under-feeding, lack of oohesion between the leaders of the various anti-Bolshevik foroes, the suooess of Bolshevik secret service agents in oreating dissension among their opponents, the highly organized Bolshevik system of propaganda and the meroiless severity of the treatment v3iioh has been meted out by the Bolsheviks to the inhabitants of districts from which the &quot;white&quot; troops have been forced to withdraw, have materially assisted Lenin and his supporters.At/
At the present time, however, the efforts of the &quot;White&quot; forces are better co-ordinated, while the appearance in ever-increasing numbers of the &quot;Green Guards&quot;, the growing resistance of the peasants, the revival of the influence of the clergy, and the union of the moderate democratic parties in the National Centre ,party, prove t:iat the national resistance to Bolshevism is hardening and must ultimately prevail,MILITARY 3IlvaATI0N:IN BU3SIA &apos;   : ^-k review of the political situation cannot be made without some reference to the military position, which is bo confused that it must be difficult to state with any accuracy the relative positions of the contending forces, as the fortune of war appears&apos;to vary from day to day.   In the early summer it seemed likely that the Siberian force operating under the command of admiral Koltohak would succeed in reaching the Volga and in effecting a junction with General Denikin&apos;s Army advancing from the South: by means, however, of a vigorous offensive the Bolsheviks succeeded in driving him haok into Siberia.   For a time it seemed possible that the Red Army would penetrate far into Siberia, but the enemy&apos;s.advanoe was.checked, and Koltohak, although he lost Tobolsk, managed to hold a position along the ishino river.- It is now reported that he has re-captur^ Tobolsk, and that fighting is in progress on a front of 500 miles between Tobolsk and Troitsk.   The Siberian Government, .which at one time contemplated the evacuation of Omsk, is now reported to be remaining in that town, but Red troops are apparently&apos; operating to the J3ast of the town, and Bolshevik risings have ocourred in Vladivo3tock and otherg places in Siberia.1&apos; -A.big Bolshevik turning movement is also in progress on the left flank of the &quot;White&quot; Army.Whether/
Mother or not the Whites will be abje to make muoh progress in their new westward offensive remains to be seen,   The spirit of their troops is said to: be,better than it was, and it is reported that tne religious movement which has been inaugurated at Tomsk, Krasnoyarsk and in other towns to combat Bolshevism, is steadily gaining;ground.   The Old -Believers, under the, banner of the Croas, together with Mahommedans under their Green flag&apos;, have proclaimed a holy- General Dehikin4s advance from the riouth has beanattended with considerable success. &apos; He has taken Kieffand has now re-captured from the Bolsheviks about -one-fourth; of --European Russia.   So effective, indeed,, has been his work;that. it is considered possible to open up British trade inthe country behind him, which is reported to be plentifully supplied with food.   He is continuing his advance slowlybut steadily, and, although it cannot&apos;be predicted with any degree of confidence that he will suooeed in reaching Moscow by the end of the year, it is possible that;as he approaches the oity,the anti-Bolsheviks, who far&apos; outnumber the Communists, may take matters into their own hands in Moscow and also in Petro^rad.   The confused nature of the&quot; military operations is well illustrated by the fact that a force of Denikin 1 s . cavalry has been^operating successfully in rear of the Bolsaevik troops, destroying their supplies&apos;and outting their communications.   It is not surprising, therefore, that Trotsky should lament his own lack of cavalry.   The Bolsheviks appear to be fully alive to the dan.b*r &quot;whioh Denikin&apos;s advanoe means to them and are making a vigorous resistance. They are working their way down the Volga with the intention of preventing any possible junction between Denikin andKoltchak/
mm    4    -Koltohak.   It if? olear, therefore, that the fighting this   $1autumn will be of exceptional interest. 1A wireless message of yesterday depicts the state ofabjeot terror to Which the advsnoe of Denikin has reduced the Soviet Government:--   &quot;Denikin13 victory will mean - for the workmen:-the reign of hunger......the conversion of theproletariat into oattle the fall of the Soviets.For the fted Army soldiers:- ...... the Czaristdiscipline of the whip, barrack regime...... oompulsorymilitary training ...... and saluting.   For theintellectual workmen;- Ifce re-establishment of officialdom, reapeot for rank ...... unemployment andoffioial routine.   For the foreigners and those not belonging to the Orthodox Churoh (e.g. the Jewish Commissaries):-  Pogroms V.,, religious persecution and oppression.   For all citizens:- ... the withdrawal of religious toleration, ohuroh raarrieges, etc   Forthe vfcole oountry:- ......the recognition of theforeign loans of Nioholas and Kerensky...... thegeneral deoline of oulture ......the restoration ofthe Monarchy ...... a new revolution and a new civil&quot;All this oan be expected from Denikin.   Workmen and peasants, defeat DenikinI&quot;In North-West Russia the leaders of the Viftiite foroes appear to be contemplating a forward movement against Fe :.rosrad, aoting in co-operation with Denikinfe advance towards Moscow,   If reports in the press of^n be relied upon, it would seem $tat von der Goltz, the German oommander in the Baltic Provinces, with his &quot;Iron Division&quot;, has decided to throw in his lot with, the &quot;Whites&quot; on this front.In connection with toe present military situation, it should be noted, that the difficulties of the Bolshevik leaders have been mch increased fcy the growth of a new organization known as the &quot;Green Guard&quot;. ,tt\e members of this organization, who to-day number several hundreds of thousands, nominally profess that they are unwilling to fight either for the &quot;Heds&quot;war.IKE Gr&amp;im (HIAftDor for the &quot;Whites&quot;,but nevertheless they urge a relentlesswar/
war against the Soviet regime.   In these oiroumstanoes, it would naturally be supposed that they would join the &quot;White&quot; forces and it i* a reflection upon the policy of the &quot;Y/hite&quot; leaders that they do not.   dhe senseless and indiscriminate shooting by the &quot;Whites&quot; of the communists whom they capture, and of all who are supposed to have sheltered, or sympathised with, the Communists, is no doubt the reason of the existence of the Green Cuards, who are largely composed of men who hrve et one time or another nerved in the fted Army, or who have been identified with the Bolshevik.&apos;.   Ihey prefer, therefore, to maintain a separate organization rather than to run the risk of being punished by&apos;the &quot;Whites&quot;.   There is n^-id to be a General Staff of the Green Guardp working in secret in Petrograd, but it is difficult to say how fer its authority extends.   It is oertain, however, that e large part of the province of Tver is in the hands of the &quot;Greens,&quot; In the Bezhetsky district of that province 10,000 &quot;Greens&quot;, led by officers and thoroughly organized, have settled matters summarily with the Bolshevik Commissaries and Communists, and are now reported to be administering the district to the satisfaction of the population,   There are large bodies of &quot;Greens&quot; in the Pskov and Dno regions.   On the Karelian front the soldiers of the .-;ec Army have on several occasions refused to attack the &quot;Greens&quot;.The &quot;Greens&quot; kill every &quot;Red&quot; whom they oatoh if he refuses to join their organization.  An incident which is reported to have occurred recently at a way-side station is typioal of the summary methods employed by the &quot;Greens&quot;. On the arrival at the station of a train filled with Eed soldiers, the &quot;Greens&quot; compelled them to turn out on to the platform.   All who confessed that they were Communists or Jew? were then shot and the remainder were given food and/
and told that they might join the &quot;Greens&quot; or proceed on their journey to the front, the &quot;Greens&quot; proclaiming that their sole objeot was to get rid of Commisyaries, Communists and Jews.   landless incidents of the same kind could be enumerated.   Sven in their independent oapaoity, the &quot;Greens&quot; are proving themselves most troublesome to the Bolsheviks, and. if only the &quot;Miitee&quot; were capable of winning them over to their side, the presenoe of an organized force of this kind whioh is aoting in good relations with the population and wl:.ioh is? operating within the area controlled by the Soviet Government might materially change the military situation and hasten the collapse of the Bolshevik power,ATTITUDE OF TH j people the spontaneous growth of the &quot;Green Guards&quot; and the friendly attitude shewn to them by the working olasses, more especially by the peasants, illustrate the political feelings which are now gaining ground in ..oissia.   Vi/hile there is no doubt that the workmen and peasants are in sympathy with muoh of the idealism which is professed by the Bolsheviks ,end are firmly opposed to the restoration of the old order of things, they are profoundly dissatisfied with the tyrannical rule of the Bolshevik Commissaries, whose communistic doctrines are loathed by the peasants.   The people, therefore, are willing to support an organization wt-?.oh, while waging a relentless war against the existing government, is yet equally opposed to the &quot;Vvhitet: forces which are considered to represent the interests of the counter-revolution.   The people are anxious for a change of Government, but, if any attempt is made toDdeprive the peasantry of their land or to curtail any cf the privileges which have been won during the revolution,they/
they will rise equally against&apos; the new Government.   In this connection a lamentable misunderstanding of the feeling of the people is displayed by certain &quot;White&quot; Generals vfao issue proclamations in Hihe oocupied distriots to the effect that &quot;this year the produoe of the land may be reaped by those who sowed, but next year the land is to be returned to its legal owners&quot;.   It is not surprising, &quot;therefore , that -a;fter a few weeks of the &quot;White&quot; regime&apos;/ reports are receiver] that the rural &apos; population is looking eagerly for the&quot;return of the &quot;xteds&quot;, as&quot; being the lesser of the two &apos; evils&apos;.   &quot;The:v  Cofmmunists wish to leave&apos; us the land, but not to let it be our own; but the &quot;Whites&quot; will not even let us have &quot;the land.&quot;   Remembering ti-;at the Bolnheviks gave them the land&apos;at the beginning- of t:*eir regime, the peasants still4&quot; frequently exclaim, &quot;long live;-the -Bolsheviks!   Down with the Communists!&quot;   It is to,be hoped that Denikin, upon whom it would seem that the hopes of the &quot;Whites&quot; iL&apos;&quot; mainly rests, realises the true situation, and that he will resist the intentions with which, rightly or wrongly, &apos;so meny of hi s supporte&apos; rs are oredited&apos;.&apos;&apos;1Reports&apos;vary&quot; as to the efficiency of the &quot;.Hed&quot; troops, who are said to number about;600,000.   It must be remembered, however, that only a comparatively small&apos; percentage of the men are genuine Bolsheviks and that a large proportion of them are mobilized by foroe and&quot;sent to the Front against their will-.   Many of them are &quot;Whites&quot; who have been forded into the r*ed Army while their wives and families are held as hostages by the Bolsheviks.   In the Spring and early *2ummer desertions from the Army reached an amazing number, and,although/
although the vigorous aotion taken by the Government oheoked the general exodus, desertions still oontinue     ^ and an inclination to fight is not the most oonspiououa military quality of many of the &quot;ited0 troops.   At the same time, it is reported that some of the Divisions are almost wholly reliable, while the presence of numerous German prisoners-of-war, who have been induced to join the Bolsheviks as instructors by the high rates of pay, should inorease their military efficiency, Trotsky and his adherents hare expressed their determinati to fight to a finish, and, if the leaders are united and remain united and if they oan oontinue to provide their troops with food and munitions, there is no reason, to suppose that the Bolshevik Government will go down without a struggle.   Jtfter all, the &quot;Ueds&quot;&apos; in Busaia. oan expeot but a short shrift if they ore defeated.waaroas op bus soviet gjaThere is no doubt that the prestige and position of the Soviet Government were considerably affeoted, first by the aooeptanoe by Germany of the Allies1 terms of peace, and secondly by the oollapse of the Communist Government in Hungary.   !Ihe Bolsheviks had finnly believed that Germany would not sign the Treaty of Versailles and the aotual signing of the Treaty came as a great shock to them.   One fall of Bela Kun was also unexpected and oaused considerable oonsternation at Mosoow,   floe BolahevikB attribute his failure to the treachery of the Socialists who betrayed him.   55ie result, consequently, in zfcissia was to widen the gap between the Extremists and the more moderate parties.Socialists/
Sooialists are now considered to be the most dangerous enemies of the Communists, and the possibility of a fusion between the various parties is less likely than it appeared to be earlier in the year.   Reports tend to show that, although Lenin is still the figure-head of the Government, his politioal influence is steadily diminishing, and that Trotsky, who virtually controls the ;ied Army, and Extremists suoh as Peters, Cersinsky and Zinoviev, have gained the upper hand.   It is clear that Lienikin&apos;s advance has thoroughly alarmed the leaders of the Bolsheviks and that, if it continues to be successful, serious dissensions are likely to break out among &apos;them.   If is&apos; reported that Moscow has already been placed under martial law as it is feared that the oity may be attacked by the &quot;White&quot; cavalry. It is evident that it is only by force,and ly the determination of its leaders, that the :jdviet Government maintain? itself in power.   In ere are signs, however, that the opposition to the Bolohevika, even in tho great towns, is gaining ground, and that individuals are plucking up courage to resist force by force.   Oh the 25th of September two bombs were hurled into a meeting of Communists at Moscow,&apos; ten comrades were killed and twenty-eight others injured.   *ooordin&amp; to the Bolsheviks&quot; &apos;&apos;t?.e news of this outrage caused a storm of indignation &quot;am^nvtLe workmen of Moscow and meetings are said to have been called at all the factories and workshops&apos;at whioh resolutions were passed, oalling for vengeanoe on all traitors antf betrayers of their oountry,   &quot;Close who do not join our ranks for playing an active part in the defence of the workmen&apos;s and peasants  oause are traitors to the labouring class and are promoting the interests of the Tzari3t Generals. May our fallen oomraoes rest in peace.   Long live the struggle for the firm establishment of -the authority ofthe/
the workmen.&apos;   Long live the Communist party!   Death to the foes of the proletarian diota tor ship&apos;   The revolutionaf] proletariat is closing its ranks!&quot;   In spite of bombastio utterances ,suoh as this,.it is doubtful whether there is... ,a majority even of the,industrial class really in favour of the, existing Government.   It is reported that even at the Putilov works, the workmen are dissatisfied with.  the Government and ,in May. it was estimated in a Bolshevik report that t&quot;.ere were only 8,000. Communists in Petrograd,. and about 25,000 sympathisers in a population of 800,000, The outrage at Moscow will, of oouree, be seized upon as an excuse for more violence by the Government.   The .. victims will be the. moderate Socialists and Democrats who are accused, by the, Bols: eviks of being responsible for the. murqer, of their comrades, and to. be acting in oo-operation with, the &quot;Whites&quot;.   In an interview with a journalist, Myaenikoff, one of the Bolshevik leaders, states &quot;There,is no doubt that the attempt made on the lives, of our comrades i? one of the links of the plots of the White Guards and of the National Centre discovered by the Soviet Government.   Our enemies were mistaken in : their reckonings,   Energetic united struggle and oomplete annihilation of the bourgeoisie and its agents will be, revenge worthy of, the base work of the enemies of the proletarian revolution.&quot;Aooording to a later report a seoond case of bomb-throwing occurred at the funeral of the victims of the first outrage,   .NATIONAL CJ3NTKE3 PAflTT      ,, The reoont bomb outrage at Moscow, which the Bolsheviks maintain was the work of members of theNational/
National Centre Party, draws attention to the existence of a party professing moderate political views within the bounds of Soviet Russia, which may have considerable influence within the near future. It is reported that this party, which was inaugurated only in the spring of this year, contains representatives from practically all the political parties in Russia except the extreme Monarchists and the extreme Revolutionaries. It includes, therefore, most of the remaining Nationalists, the Octobrists, the Cadet Party and certain Socialists belonging to the Plekanoff group, the Mensheviks and some of the Right Social Revolutionaries. Its leaders are said to be men of great political prominence and the party has been recognized by Denikin and Koltchak as an advisory group for the formation of Koltchak&apos;s political programme. In their opinion peace in Russia is impossible so long as Lenin, Troteky, Zinoviev, Krassin and their supporters remain in power, and that, even if the Allied Powers were to recognise the Bolshevik Government, the counter-revolutionary movement now in progress would continue. The party is organized into two groups - one for military, the other for political affairs - and the leaders appear to be thoroughly in touch with the working of the Soviet Government and with the situation in Russia generally. Their attitude towards Great Britain is friendly. They recognise that after the overthrow of the Bolsheviks Russia will be compelled to accept the assistance of some foreign power, and that the choice really lies between Great Britain and Germany, because the United States is too far away to be sufficiently in touch with Russian ideas and because France, by the policy adopted by the French in Odessa, has alienated Russian sympathy. In spite of her regrettable indecision with regard/ 
regard to the suppression of Bolshevism, the party prefers Great Britain to Germany and it wishes to see the regeneration of Russia effected by British assistance because it believes that Great Britain, while demanding large commercial concessions, will not attempt to interfere with the internal Government of Russia. The party recognises Koltchak, but refuses to admit the authority of any Russian who has left Russia during the revolution. It is of opinion that there will be no place for the émigrés in Russia for at least ten years after the overthrow of the Bolsheviks. The party makes no pretention to be the nucleus of a future government, but, admitting that a dictatorship of some kind will probably be necessary after the disappearance of the present régime, considers that the only salvation for Russia lies in the dictator being surrounded by a group of advisers who thoroughly understand the mind of the people and who are in sympathy with many of the social and economic changes which have been brought about by the Revolution. The party stands for the transfer of all land to the peasants without any reference of the question to a National Assembly; for the system of national education inaugurated by the Bolsheviks; for the recognition of the separation of Church and State, and for the granting to the workmen of a measure of control in the administration of factories.

It is hardly surprising that a party which professes views of this kind should excite the animosity of the Bolsheviks. It is reported that some of its leaders have already been executed, but it is believed that the organization will continue and may have a far-reaching influence in the future.

-i3-         &apos;   -   i;0FOriBIGH- POLICY OF jgjg aOVIE/JB  QM&amp;llgAi::When considering the foreign polioy of the Soviet Government, it should always be borne in mind that the ideal which is the basis of the political creed of Lenin and his supporters is to brin&amp; about a social revolution throughout the world.   Iheir aspiration is to destroy the whole structure of society as it exists to-day and to replace it by a ooiamunistio Utopia, which should ultimately embrace all races and creeds in a single brotherhood of men.   liie aspiration is not a new one, but never has it been adopted by a political party with such, an implacable and unswerving determination as by the Bolsheviks.   QJie oonfusion and disintegration in Europe caused by the war,and the helpless and feckless character oi the ctussian people, gave them a splendid opportunity for developing and propagating their theories of government.   After concluding the peace of Brest-Litovsk with the Germans, they soon suooeeded in making themselves the masters of the greater part of ^wssia in Uurope, and then from this wonderful oentral position, in which they were equally in touch with ;!Jast and v/est, they proceeded to oonoentrate their efforts upon their political propaganda.   Owing to its long duration and universal extent   the war gave them a striking opportunity for increasing their influenoe.   The misery and distress which it brought in its train effectively prepared the ground for Bolshevik propaganda by making the people in almost every country dissatisfied with existing forms of government and conditions of life and ready to aooept any schemes of social reform, however wild and impraoticable they might be, provided that they broke away from the political and - &apos; diplomatic traditions of the past.No sooner was Lenin established in power in Mosoow andPetrograd/
petrograd than the agents of Bolshevism went to work. Their influence was soon traced in almost every come the Globe,   The Communists in Hungary, the :jpartaoists in Germany, the Extremists in iiJurope, America and Asia are either in direct touoh with Moscow or are indirectly offeoted by the political theories which are preaohed by Lenin,The signing of the. armies^tioe in November, 1918, considerably altered the political situation, first, beoause with the restoration of peace the Allied Powers were faceci with the problems of the reconstruction of ^*europe,and secondly because the question of the -eoognition or non-reoognition of trie Bolshevik Governing in iiupsia was bound to come to the fore.   In spite of the inability of the Allied Powers to arrive at any common understanding with regard to the suppression of the Bolsheviks, and the inadequacy of the military support which they have given to the anti-Bolihevik foroes, the position of the Bolshevik Government is far more preoarious than it was during the war,   Hot only has the opposition to its rule in Russia *;rown enormous, but the powers of law and order tl-rou&amp;hout the world have now become fully elive to the danger to jnoiety whioh the continued political unrest in [$ussia implies, peaoe with, the world outride cassia - a peaoe whioh would carry with it the recognition of their Government j by the Allied Powers - is essential to the Bolsheviks if they are to remain in power.   The present polioy, therefore, of Lenin and  his supporters is to secure peaoe first with the governments of the various Baltio Provinces, Finland and Germany and then with the rest of the world.   It is in favour of peaoe that Tohitohe the Commissary for Foreign Affairs, has recently issuedhis/
his proclamation to the workers of England and France in which he repudiates on behalf of his Government "all aims or conquest and violence against other nations" and expresses his readiness "to consider in the most conciliatory spirit all means for bringing about the reign of peace with the Governments at present at war with Soviet Russia." He lays the blame for the continuance of hostilities upon the Entente Governments and adjures the workers "to intervene with all the organized force of your class" to help the Russian people to live in peace without molestation, and to liberate the people of the Baltic Provinces "who are the victims of your imperialistic governments." Tchitcherin is also reported to have addressed a message to the "Chicago Daily News" stating the conditions on which his government would be prepared to make peace. These include the cessation of military operations by the Allied Powers on the territory of the former Russian Empire; the raising of the Allied blockade; the assumption by Soviet Russia of the Imperial debts, and mutual amnesties and simultaneous demobilization of all the contending factions within the former Russian Empire. He also stated that the policy of his Government on the conclusion of peace would be to establish economic relations with all countries and he expressed its willingness to grant concessions to foreign capital on liberal terms.

Tchitcherin is the titular, but Litvinoff the real head of the Foreign Office. Litvinoff&apos;s anxiety to get in touch with this country upon any excuse is shown by the interchange of wireless messages with our Foreign Office to arrange a meeting in Denmark for the exchange of prisoners.

This consuming desire to get into touch with England accounts for the tragi-comedy of Professor Goode and Mr./

  
Mr. Keeling, whioh ia still being discussed in the newspapers,   Goode is an excitable doptrina^re who went, into iteaBia as special correspondent of the &quot;Manchester I Guardian&quot; in oompany with kr. Kealing.   Ine latter was arrested, and Gbode, travelling with a safe conduct from the Joviet Government,&apos;left him to his. fate.  He was on the best term? with Litvinoff, and when he arrived at ton] he was &quot;talking big&quot; about having brought back with him sufficient to oause a Hed devolution in England.   He appears to have been consulted as to the formation of th* Peaoe Terms to be offered by the Bolshevists, in order tha they might be framed in a form acceptable to the bourgeoisie of the iJntente.  He promised that on his returi to England he would transmit the new Terms to the jeoond International aa well as to President Wilson.   Ihe Sathonian Government detained all his papers and sent thi under seal to the 3sthonian Minister in London.   Goode himself waB brought to 3heerneas by H.i-i.3. &quot;Danae&quot;. Whatever mesaage he may have had, he thought it more prufli not to deliver it, for he was reoeived on arrival by a number of newspaper representatives and by Mrs. Keeling who demanded an explanation of hie conduct towards her husband.The &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; has taken: alarm and hes thought it better not to print his communications, and bo far from being in a position to oarry out a Bolshevik offensive in this oountry, he finds himself in the positH of a defendant with a bad case.The Bolsheviks require peace to make themseivea seoure in russia and to obtain it are ready to negotiate with imperialistic governments, but they have no intents of dropping their propaganda or of oeasing to preach th^doctrines/

Inere is no question, however, that it is doing everything in its power to&apos;promote relations with Germany and that the German Government ia in communication with Moaoow.    It is reported that German Soviets, with many thousands of members, have been established both in Moaoow and petrogracj and the Leipzig political sooiety is said to be &quot;   negotiating with the:/Bolahevika&apos;for concessions of lands : ;\ to&apos; its members,: to be. worked aa &quot;rural oommunes.&quot;    Krasin - the Commissary of Ways and communicate-tiOna, one of the ablest1 Bolshevik leaders,&apos; ieaarjl to be entirely pro-German.    In petrograd German oommeroial travellers are - ubiquitous.;   they are reported to be introducing &quot;ersatz&quot; fobdatuffs which the Germans themselves no longer require,and/
and other artioles and materials of whioh the war has left them a surplus.    3aooarin, for instanoe, has been largely imported into Russia, and petrograd is now full of sweet shops.    It is also asserted that offioial German oommeroial,commissions have already been sent to Bussia and that the Bolsheviks are willing to grant trade oonoesslons to the Germane, who, on their side, are anxious to supply the tiuasians with steel rails, looomotives, motor transport and the agricultural implements of which they stand in so xnuoh need.    &apos;Biere can be little doubt that the German penetration will oontinue so long as the Bolsheviks remain in power.ATTBMPT3 AT OOMMiflKOIAL RELATIONS WITH contributory COPNTKIES.Amerioan and Swedish oommeroial agents are also at work in Northern ftissia.    There is said to be on American trade commission in Moscow, and it is reported that warehouses and depots have been secured by Ameri in Petrograd for ihe reception of American goods, as soon as they can be imported into Russia,    Uke Bolshevil Government is doing everything in its power to encourage foreign trade beoause it realises that without foreign help any amelioration in the oonditions of life in ftissii is hopeless and its own continuance in power impossible. The financial bankruptcy of Russia, which has been brought about by the war,, by inept Bolshevik methods of finance, and by the difficulties of transport, will make it extremely diffioult for the Bolsheviks to enter into trade relations with the outside world.    So long as the value of the rouble is so low, it is doubtful whether i foreign firms will aooept it in payment, and the proposals of the Bolsheviks to place large orders inforeign/
foreign countries for manufactured goods in return for flax, hemp, hides and possibly oil and platinum exported from Russia, are complicated by the smallness of the stocks of these commodities in their possession and by their inability to increase them, due partly to the difficulties of transport, and partly to the fact that they no longer retain the parts of the country from which the majority of these commodities are obtained. It would appear, therefore, that unless the Bolshevik Government can obtain peace with the Allies and succeed in making itself supreme throughout the whole of Russia, the re-opening of foreign trade (at any rate on a scale at all commensurate with the needs of Russia) is a practical impossibility.



BOLSHEVIK PROPAGANDA

Propaganda is undoubtedly the principal weapon of Bolshevism and the main instrument by which the Bolsheviks hope to carry out their policy of world revolution. Among the papers belonging to Bela Kun&apos;s Government found at Buda Pesth was a report on the Bolshevik Propaganda Bureau. This report supplies interesting details as to the present activities of the Bolshevik agents and of their future plans. In spite of stringent precautions on the frontiers, the Bolsheviks, by means of bribes, are able to introduce their pamphlets into Scandinavia. They have offices in direct communication with Moscow at Helsingfors, Stockholm and Christiania, and they are known to be in touch with the Communist Party in the United States. Their activities in both North and South America and in Mexico are considerable, and their influence has been traced in the recent racial riots at Chicago and Washington. The fall of the Communist Government in Hungary/

 
Hungary probably dislooated to some extent the Bolshevik0propaganda In Western Europe, but their agencies, sometii under cover of the Bed Cross, are active in Switzerland and Holland and they are in touoh, either directly or indirectly, with the Extremists in most of the oountrieg Europe.    Their object, as has already been stated, is ti promote industrial unrest and to dislocate trade and oommeroe as for as possible.    Their aotivlty in the Bat is very notioeable and its effects are felt in Turkey, Persia, India&apos;and Sgypt and also in China, Korea, Afghanistan and generally throughout Asia.    Two pamphi were recently discovered in Constantinople, whioh are written in the Turkish language, but whioh apparently wi printed abroad.    They are addressed to Turkish workmen peasants and incite them to rise and fight in the Eed Revolution.    The workers are told that their only friei are the Bolsheviks and the charms of the Soviet form of Government are painted in alluring colours.    Stoey are urged to destroy, not only capitalists, but also all persons who, under the names of national Socialists, Revolutionary Socialists, Social Democrats and Menshevft in any way. deprecate direct and immediate action against the Bourgeoisie.    In all Mohammedan countries the Bolsheviks are endeavouring to associate themselves with the Pan-Islamio movement and tiaey appear to be working 1 some kind of oo-operation with the Young Tuik Party.   I are especially anxious to push their doctrines in India and a special seotion of the Propaganda Bureau in Mosco&apos; is devoted to work in that Continent.    Indian agitator, are trained there in the doctrines of Bolshevism and sent back through Persia and Afghanistan  to influenoetheir oountrymen,    The Bolsheviks did their utmost tosuppoi
support the recent Afghan rising and were lavish in their promises of support.    Their failure&quot; to fulfil their promises has probably not improved their position in Afghanistan and it is doubtful whether their oommunistio dootrinea; really appeal to the Mohammedan world.    At the same time, the spirit of raoial animosity whioh they are so keen to foster is oreating a spirit of unrest in the East whioh may render the situation diffioult for the Government of India.    In Egypt the student olass is oertainly affeoted ty Bolshevik ideas and such of the reoent unrest in that oountry was of a revolutionary oharaoter.    In China Bolshevik literature, is being, widely ?oiroulated. After the downfall of the Soviet in vladivostock in the summer of 1918, many cf the Bolsheviks fled to Yokohama and Shanghai and from these towns they succeeded in making their way into China.    Opinions differ as to whether Bolshevism has actually made much progress among the Chinese, but the reoent disturbances in China and the threatened boycott of Japanese goods may be attributed in some measure to-Bolshevik agitators who are endeavouring to ineetifte  the people against Japan. &apos;  In VTadivostook Bolshevik agents are conducting &amp; vigorous anti-Koltohak propaganda and the general disoontent which is caused by the depreciation &quot;of the Siberian rouble&apos; (which &quot;is how worth less than a penny, largely&apos; owing to Chinese speoulations in itomanoff and Kerensky money) finds expression in the statement that the Soviet Government Would never allow the existenbe of such a state of affairs and that a change of government is necessary.In Russia itself the Bolsheviks set even more store upon their propaganda than upon their military operations.A/
A reoent order to all railway station oommandanta in Soviet Kusaia instructed them to expedite the diopatoh H all literary propaganda destined for the front Toy special trains, and that such trains were tp have preoedenoe of alj other trains, eyen troop trains.

In theory the administrative and txeoutive power is in the hands of the working olaas population;   in praotioe it belongs to eighteen oommiasariea who are elected by a Central Executive Committee of 200 members.    TklB Committee appears to haw] arrogated to itself, most of the funotions which properly belong to the Ail Russian Congress * a body consisting of over a thousand members eleoted to serve on it from the provincial and oity Soviets.    This Assembly is really not in the least representative, because its members are not appointed by the free choice of the electors.    !Ike following example of the method of election to the Petrograd Sovdep may be cited to show the kind of freedom whioh exists among the Bolsheviks.    At the Putilov works the overaeera who ore appointed by the Government, oallef together the workmen and told them that they were to eleotthoir/
their members for the Soviet,&quot;   At the same time the overseers pointed out that they had selected several persons whom tirey&apos;considered suitable candidates beoause they were supporters of&apos; the Government.    They then went on -to&apos;say that any individual who was not a supporter of the Government- must clearly be a supporter of KoltohaV and they would know how to deal with him. There were-no1 dissentients to the names put forward by the Voverseers and consequently the Govomment candidates were elected neTr^ne-iaontradioente&apos;.    The&apos; communists exercise&apos; the strongest pressure to ensure the election of their &quot;own-candidates &quot;at all elections-1, and the workpeople now realise that, if they elect candidates who do not support the Government, their representatives are in ,grave danger of being&quot; arrested. &quot; &apos; At a recent election for the Petrograd Soviet the workmen deoided therefore tobring forward their candidates as non-party men.

(iiie inability of the people to resist its power.    Th, oapture of KraasnayeGorka, a fortress which, is the key to Cronstadtand Petrograd, on the 13th of June by a force of &quot;Whites&quot; acting in oollusion with Hekludov, th &quot;Red&quot; Governor of the fortress, was the ostensible oauae for Peters1 conduct.    She fortress was recaptured withe muoh difficulty as no support was sent to Nekludov by th &quot;Whites&quot;, but the incident was. turned to aooount by the Bolsheviks to institute a new persecution against the &quot;&quot;White&quot;   offioers who are forced to. serve in the &quot;Red&quot; Army, and.to oarry out a systematic search for the many deserters from the &quot;Red&quot;&apos; Army.    Peters was sent to Petrograd from Moscow to supervise the internal defenoe! the,City.    His methods were so severe that he was acoufj by Zinoviev of being &quot;the prime counter-revolutionary&quot; beoause he did more in two weeks to popularise the &quot;vgiil by his brutal methods than the &quot;Wiite&quot; Generals, Udenitc and Bod2ianko, had done in six months.    Peters1 aotivitj were direoted, not so muoh to the restoration of publio order, as to the extermination of deserters and oounter-revolutionaries, in which he was more or less successful as thousands of deserters and supposed supporters of th &quot;Whites&quot; were discovered and sent off to serve in the Ai or drafted into labour units or concentration  camps, House to house searches were conducted by communist battalions of men and women especially organized for th purpose.    Market plaoes , railway stations, oinematograpl palaoes, theatres and even churches were subjected tosudden inspections, the publio being let out one by one0after strict examination,    3earohes were conducted at night and the searchers often availed themselves of theopportunity/
- 25 - 184 :opportunity of helping themselves to the goods and chattels of the occupants of the houses whioh they entered.    It was officially announced that the aim of the wholesale searohings was to discover arms and.it was,further announced that only, limited amounts of food and ready money were to be retained by bourgeois citizens.    Any food or money above the fixed amount of 5000 roubles was to be oonfisoated, and a receipt for the sum, taken to be given t* the sufferer,    Ho oase-is reported of any such reoeipt being given&apos;.    in one house where the owner had the temerity to protest and demanded a legal receipt, the communist co&amp;rade who was carrying off his money simply retorted &quot;What, you want us to march you off to the Gorokhovaya?  Be thankful if we leave you the olothes in whioh you are standing.&quot;    The seorohes went on until the searchers were tired of the work, which happened as soon as they had carried off all the booty on which they oould lay hands.1    On the 22nd of June Peters issued an order, stating that the searching of the lodgings of the propertied classes had revealed large supplies gf arms and ammunition and that a formidable conspiracy had been nipped in the bud by his vigilanoe.    He further stated that any person found in possession of arms after the 24th of June would be summarily shot.    &quot;I am oonvinoed,&quot; he concluded, &quot;that the proletariat of Petrograd will $id me to carry to an end the business of disarming the bourgeoisie and rendering the White Guard hordes harmless.&quot;    Searohes continued after the issue of this order, and all the foreign missions were raided and looted.    It is reported that twenty million roubles were taken from the Swiss Mission.    An ifinglish lady who was present describes how the commissaries and their subordinates thrust bundles of notes into their pockets,heaping/
heaping whatever they oould not take for themselves into lorries1. &quot; Peters justified himself on the ground that &quot;al 8o*-oalled neutral missions are just simply spy-nests&quot; and Zinoviev, who is a great: talker, bragged in the Soviet of how the authorities had bleared  petrograd of &quot;the last   ; remnants of festering manure, in the form of White Guard cattle and foreign lackeys.&quot;    A reoent report states that the&apos;severity of the Bolshevik rule in Petrograd has been relaxed and there is a rumour that Peters has been removed from his dictatorship, but the methods employed by &quot;him at petrograd appear to be those adopted bjfr the Bolshevik Commissaries elsewhere,    Kalinin, the president of the Central Executive Committee of theAll-ftussian 3oviet, who is proving himself to bo the moat able agitato and propagandist in Russia, spends much of his time in touring the provinces and is met wherever he goes by complaints against the local Communists and protests again at the tyranny of the Commissaries.    He is said to be oonvinoed of the impossibility of forcing communism on the peasants, and the proceedings of the ^Green Guards&quot;, to whioh referenoe has already been made, and the peaeant risings whioh are becoming more frequent and better organized in oharaoter, go to prove that his judgment ia correot.    The obstinate refusal of the peasants to submit to mobilisation and the rapid inorease of the &quot;Green Guards have obliged the Government to draft into the Army eveiy available workman in the towns. ( . Reserve regiments of woriaaen, the organization of vshioh was left to the Counoil of Professional Unions,, were also formed.    The militarytraining, however, took plape after working hours and.   ,.wine Ik afU^c, ..... - ^caused considerable dissatisfaction, with the result thatthe projeot seems to have been abandoned, the authoritiesapparently/
apparently fearing to employ force to compel the workmen to appear on parade.    A militia of women has been formed and It ia reported -that the members of &quot;the force, who oarry rifles, look very smart, but that &quot;their authority is questionable.    Eaey are occasionally to be seen mailing gestures of protest when they see soldierar and sailors hanging round the steps and buffers of street oars,, but Weir protests are generally met with jooular retorts bubh as, &quot;Oh, tovailshtoh (petticoat), do please come and pull&apos;&apos; me&apos; off th e tram!&quot;JThe Bolshevik Government has been faced with industrial troubles&apos;and has dealt with them in the summary &apos;manner which might havo been eypeoted from it.    In the &quot;summer there was a strike cn the railways which was &quot;suppressed in three days, but which entailed three hundred casual ties.    The reason for tho failure of the strike is attributed to the laok of unity of the railwaymen, but, it is also asserted, that oertoin of the men who, with the connivance of the Government, had parried out speculative deals in foodstuffs, acted as Government agents and strike provokers.    The strikes vfoioh took place in the Putilov, Qbouhov, Alejandrov and other works in July were put down with ruthless severity, the ringleaders and many others being shot...   It &apos;fl-s- not.surprising; in view of their -own methods with&apos; strikers, that the Bolsheviks interpreted Mr, liloyd George Vs. statement that hid&apos;Government proposed to fis^it the iJailway strike&apos;:.v^L-th :ali*&quot;tK^-mleanB7&apos;^^their disposal to mean-- &quot;KxeoutiohS&apos;beatings with gun-butts, ,pricon,. eyiaiiicn- --from&quot; hous^s^ahd^the^oth^r means employed &amp;by, papitaliste-.:&quot;u- *&amp;:amv 1The stories which have been circulated with regard tothe/
the oommunlstio treatment of women     the Bolsheviks are    I apparently without foundation, and the position of women if? Soviet fiussla is reported to be good.    Indeed,it is one of I Lenin18 objeote to emancipate women from &quot;the chains of household slavery&quot; vhich he is: reportod to have explained in a speech at Moscow to mean the abolition of domestic oraches, Kitchens and other institutions,     Ihus only could the absolute equality of women be realised.    According to I the Petrograd newspaper &quot;Isvestia&quot;, an experiment in this- .;. Ci      &apos; i i yy,&apos;?y / - 1 --       &apos; &apos;&quot; Idirection has already been tried, and ohildren fzom the age i of three have been taken from their parents and plaoed in State institutions where they are to be brought up on strict Bolshevik lines.    It is stated that at Tula, 7000 children, under ten years of age, were taken from their homes and any parents vfoo dared to protest were arrested.    Many of the ohildren are said to have died as a first result of the experiment, but the Soviet pross weloomod the prospeot of ti remainder growing up into good Bolsheviks and suggested thai tfaoir education should be confidod to soldiers of the &quot;Red&quot; Army, who were no longer fit for active servioe.    To prote( the children from the dangerous influence of their parents, who might have bourgeois sympathies, it was proposed that nc parental visits to the state institution should be toleratedECONOMIC CONDITION 0? BOLSfrDYIK russia the conditions of living In Bolshevik Bussia are growin steadily worse.    In nothing have the corruption and incompetence of the Soviet Government been more notioeable than in its looal administration,    Hhe almost complete breakdown in the railway transport system, due partly to thj unsettled state of the country and the military exigencies,and/
and partly to the disorganization of the. administration and to tho laok of ooal and rolling stock,; has led to a state of famine, whioh in some districts is already aoute.    In the Government of Novgorod the food question is said to be ipartioularly serious and it is, reported that the peasants have for more than a month subsisted:on. moss, whioh they make into unpalatable,and liigjily indigestible oakes,    In many distriots the people will only-supply food in exchange for commodities suoh as salt, olothes, boots, eto., and a speoial department of the Soviet is said to have been established in Moscow to supply suon oommbdities to the peasants in exohange for -breadv The animosity of the peasants against the Government is so great that, in aome plaoes, they are refusing to work the land properly, their argument being that if they sow grain the Bolsheviks will merely take their orops away from them.    They have no intention, therefore, of sowing more grain than will be sufficient for their own&apos; heeds.    It is reported that there is already a deficiency of eighteen million pood? of seed for spring sowing.    In spite of this, however, there is in all probability in Russia a sufficient supply of food to suffice for the whole population uttt^^^^iBi^iiag of next year, -if only the means of transport can be reorganized to- a. , J((-   p t J 1&quot; i&amp;tSOV    i--Ov* *facilitate its distribution.    Badaev, the Pood Commissary, has announoed that this year&apos;s oreps are,good, but that the :shortage*of labour was delaying the harvest,. v , He proposed to employ the bourgeoisie in the fields as the unemployed.  ;        *&apos; g&apos;j V.JL&apos;iJ&apos;**       &apos;v&quot; &quot;    &apos;workmen in Petrograd and Mosoow were,disinclined - to do the work.    Zinoviev vetoed his proposal, declaring.that tihe bourgeoisie had done their duty tar more conscientiously than the workmen.
tOne of tho moat aoute problems with whioh the BoldGovernment is now faoed ia the further&quot;requisition o:cattle whioh is said to be imminent.     Thia ia oertairito exasperate the peasants aa the Government will onlygive 3000-4000 roubles for a oow for whioh 20000-30000roubles can be obtained from an ordinary purchaser,    HJuno,: when the last requisition took place in the provinfof PetrogradV aa a result of a food orisia in the Army,the Government took all the ofcttle from their owners leejonly one cow and one oalf to every five of the populationBullocka were left on the scale of one bullook to everythirty cows.    All the pigs were taken, with the exoeptioof sows with suoklings under six weeks old.    One sheep \left to every two persona.    Soviet Oommunes reoeivedslightly better terms, one cow being left to every threepersona, but thia distinction merely embittered the vastof the peasants still more against the Government.    In thlevent of the threat of a further requisition of cattle, it(probable that the peasants will kill.off their beasts fortheir own food supply rather than surrender them to theGovernment for a minimum sum in &quot;Kerenskys&quot;.In Petrograd and Mosoow the reserves of food are saidto be extremely short,    At a weekly meeting of the Oounoilof the former oity towards the end of August, the delegateof the Food Commissariat stated that there, were only 52 poocof sugar, seven days&apos; supply of farinaceous foods and three; d^ in the Commisaariat warehouses.   ijalso stated that every day there was a falling off in thesupplies of food Btuffs,    He blamed the Commissary of ways and Communications for the shortage.    But, although the   ^supplies of food may be defioient, undoubtedly the chiefcount in the indiotment against the Soviet administration isthe/
the manner of their distribution,    The population of Petrograd, aooordlng to the statistics of the Commissariat of Food, is a million, but, according to the Dwellings Department, th e population is not more than 800,000.    This difference is aooounted for by the abuses and corruption in the issue and use of food oards.    There are oases of people being in the possession of three or four food oards and a oaBe has been reported of a man using regularly seventeen children^ oardfl, of which he had obtained possession fraudulently.    It is a simple matter to defraud tho Commissariat of Food beoause there is so much chaos and corruption in the various Commissariats that no attempt is made to check the exact number of the aotual users of food oards in each house and lodging.    The Commissariat of Food has more than onoe threatened to punish the &quot;bearded&quot; boys and the &quot;middle*-aged&quot; girls who devour the children&apos;s dinners in the communal dining rooms, but the threat does not appear ever to have been put into execution and trading in children1 e food cards continues to be indulged in, at prioes varying from 50 to 100 roubles per oard ,At the beginning of June 335,000 dinners were Issued to adults dally in the communal dining rooms and one free meal for all ohildren.    At the end of June there was a food crisis and since that date the quality of the food has deteriorated and the.quantity has been reduoed.It is not so much the lack of supplies, however, as the system of their distribution Which causes the food troubles in Petrograd and Mosoow.    It is largely owing to the system of distribution which is in force that half the population feeds comparatively well, while the other half is on the brink of starvation.    A decree was passed on the 20th ofMarch/
!Maroh by whioh the entire distribution of food was        ^ concentrated in the hands of one authority, but even in petrograd this deoree has not yet been put in foroe,   It ia considered that, even with the supplies of food available, I if the distribution were striotly oonoentrated under one    I department, the rations received by eaoh member of the community would be enough for his subsistence.   Under the existing system, however, the distribution of food is in the hands of various departments.   x standard supply is issued for. eaoh individual by the Commissariat of Food, and this is inoreased by. rations issued by the Commissariats of Public Health, $duoation and Insurance, whose main task is t/ look after the interests of the children, and by various public bodies suoh as the River Transport, the District Forestry Commission, etc, and oertain factories.   In this way persons whose work or oonneotions do not enable them to obtain food from any of these outside sources have to rely upon the Commissariat of Food, the supplies of which Department are muoh smaller and of poorer quality than those provided by the other departments and publio bodiesIPtamben of the Biver Transport Co-operative, for instance, most of whom are oivllians, received in June a pound and a half&apos;of bread daily, whereas the first category of the general population only received half a pound.   Needless to say, the Communists themselves and those who have any influence with the Commissaries fare much better than -the rest of the people.   They either find considerable supplies left over after the,general distribution, or take an extra share as a privilege to ^hich their political views entitle them. It is not surprising that such an inequitable and ill-arranged method of distribution should lead to the speculation in food whioh, is always going on in spite ofthe/
tho Governments threats at-Its suppression,   If a consumer suooeeds in getting more of any oommodity than he aotually requires, he naturally goes and sells it to some one less fortunate than himself.  Huge,profits are being realized by this kind of speculation not only in food but in other Government supplies,   3o great, indeed, was the speoulation in military stores and equipment uhioh were sold openly in the streets of Petrograd even by the &quot;Red&quot; soldiers and sailors themselves, that Peters in June issued an order to the military commanders and commissaries to point out to the men their outrageous behaviour.   He threatened to punish severely not only the sellers, but also their military superiors, if the praotioe were continued.   The corruption of the administration of the Commissariat of Pood is illustrated by the faot that the great fire which broke out at Cronstadt on the 13th of August and destroyed large supplies of food stuffs was the work of the Bolsheviks them-selves.   Theft on the part of the food authorities in Cronstadt had reached such a pitoh, that the oulprits set fire to the stores Intending to bum part of them in order to conceal their robberies.   At first the Government pretended that the fire was the work of the &quot;Whites&quot;, but it was &quot;definitely proved that it was inoendiarism on the part of the officials,and the matter was then hushed up.The prioes of food stuffs continue to ttount.   At Petrograd at the end of August it is reported that salt oost 90 roubles a pound, meat 90 roubles a pound, butter 360 roubles a pOund, bread 100-130 roubles a pound and potatoes 60 roubles a pound,   At Mosoow at about the seme date the prioes were even higher, blaok bread oost 75 roubles a pound, and sugar fetched 240 roubles a pound, potatoes 97 roubles and salt 60 roubles.   Cherries were sold in the streets/
streets for 160 roubles a pound.   The prioe of living at ..;) Moaoow is estimated at 12,000 roubles a month, and it is diffioult to see how the majority of the population will oontinue to live during the ooming winter.   There is no ooal and there is scarcely any liquid fuel as the supplies of Vodka alcohol have been praotioally exhausted.   Owing to the total disorganization of labour there is little wood fuel available and this is commandeered by the Government. In the spring of this year firewood oost 600 roubles per aajine and was scarcely obtainable.   It is now reported that there is no fuel at all at Petrograd and that the Government has issued a decree for the demolition of all the wooden buildings in the oity.   It is stated that the inhabitants are oarrying off everything which oan serve as fuel, even stripping off the wooden fittings in briok and stone houses.The soaroity of food and the general ineffioienoy of the Bolshevik local administration have considerably affected the health of the people.   Una death rate among children and old people has been very high during the Bolshevik regime.   Cholera, typhus, spotted fever and other diseases, due to bad nourishment and insanitary conditions of life, have been prevalent in Petrograd and Mosoow.   It ia reported that cholera is now diminishing in ,petrograd, but that there is a serious epidemic of dysentery.It is difficult to form any estimate of the Industrial oondition of Bolshevik russia.   A  oertain number of munition factories are no doubt still at work, but the lack,of fuel, combined with the difficulty of obtaining raw materials owing to the laok of transport, the enormous demands for pay and the low quality of the work must/
must have seriously affected,-if not entirely ruined, the industries of the country,   In a leading artiole vftiioh recently appeared in the &quot;PravdaJ, the  rinoipal Bolshevik newspaper, the writer declared that If the- Allies raised the blookade, established an interchange&apos;&apos; of goods and sent machinery and: manufactured*&apos; goods : to- russia, the Russians Would shew toe whole world a creative power which would soon lead to the undermining&apos; of bapiitalisti^ 3urope, and to the formation of soviet&apos;Governments throughout the world.   Perhaps it is asking rather too muoh of the Allied Governments to assist the Bolsheviks to wipe them out of existence, but the results of the oommunistio experiments in industrial output in Soviet Russia and Hungary are not suoh. as to bear out the-predictions of the author of the artiole in &quot;pravda&quot;.COITCLTJSIOHftie reign of Communism in Mssia has brought nothing but ruin and misery to the people, -and, up to the present time, Lenin and his government have displayed no sign of any oonstruotive polioy whioh is either practicable or even popular.- Oh ey have ruined and massacred the upper and middle classes, but they have not apparently suooeeded in improving the social and eoonomio &quot;condition of the -masses.   They have alienated the peasants to whom they handed over the land with the&quot; result that they refuse to cultivate it, will not serve in the\iied&apos;&quot;Army and cannot be prevailed upon to pay taxes.   (Ehey^nave;-ruifi eiiFthe industri es of. the country and broughtv it into a state of bankruptcy, from whioh it will take- years to recover,
mm   jj6   *&quot;In Fr&amp;noe, where at first the great revolution followed much the same course as the.-;revolution has so,far followed in itussia;, the, national bankmptoy and the universal misery of the people, combined with the spirit of patriotism aroused by the;intervention of foreigners to suppress the devolution by force, of arms., led. the Jacobins to embark upon a war of conquest-to,; spread their revolutionary ideals.   The Bolshevik, leadersy: eyen if they were so inclined., are not in a strong enough position.at home to begin a war of aggression.   One people are tired of war and there is no longer the incentive oauf?ed by foreign interference in the domestic troubles of itussia.   Peace with, the Allies is essential for the Bolsheviks.   Time is their greatest ally,   Peaoe would be employed.by them in the same way as they employed the Peaoe of Brest-Li tovsk,. naiaoly, as a breathing spaoe in which they could develop their schemes for a sooial revolution in other countries.   The^.- are internationalists and their avowed aim is to destroy the existing sooial order throughout the world.Tanks, cavalry and heavy artillery are on the side of Denikin, and:the Bolsheviks, having sown the wind, show hy their wireless, messages how the approaching harvest of the whirlwind is trying their nerves.The immediate future of .tussia and the general peaoe    1 of the world would, therefore, appear to depend upon the suooerjs of the anti-Bolshevik foroes,and upon the ability of whatever new Government may pome into power,to satisfy the needs and aspirations of the xiussian people.   If any attempt , is made to undo the main results of the revolution, more especially if any attempt&quot;is made to take away the land from the peasants, there will be no lasting settlement^in Tvussia.   The hope for the future seems to lie in theestablishment/
\ inestablishment of a strong dictatorship supported by the various moderate parties and prepared to oarry out the policy outlined by the leaders of the National Central Party.   Vihether the mutual jealousies of the various fiussian leaders would permit of the successful establishment of a dictatorship,and whether or not such a form of government would be favourably disposed towards the allied Powers in general and thi.? country In. particular, remain to be seen. In all probability its motto would be &quot;Russia for the Sussiane&quot;, but, as the ftassians will obviously be unable to start their industries or to devolop the resouroes of their country without foreign finrncial and teohnioal assistance, the task must inevitably be entrusteo to euoh foreigners as are willing to produce the necessary capital and are best oapable of winning the confidence of the people.The presence of so many Germans in jrtussia who cannot all be Communists, end the proximity of German armed foroes may precipitate the fall of the Communists, and this may be followed by pogroms, and German domination in xtussia. That seems to be the danger of the moment.B. H. T.
