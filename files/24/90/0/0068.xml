Attitude of Treasury towards Scheme for Flax Cultivation in Ireland.

The Committee of Home Affairs on 18th August, considered a Memorandum on Experimental Flax Cultivation in Ireland submitted by the President of the Board of Trade, and decided:-

"To approve the proposals of the President of the Board of Trade subject to the amendment that instead of a Government Director there should be a Government Supervisor on each undertaking with a power to ? expenditure. The details of the schemes to be settled in consultation with the Treasury."

On 27th August, a letter was consequently addressed by the Board of Trade to the Treasury, outlining the proposals for the two schemes suggested in the Memorandum to the Committee of Home Affairs, and concluding:

"In both cases it is suggested that any profits resulting from the ventures should be divided between the Government and the Promoters in the proportion of 2/3rds to the former and 1/3rd to the latter.

Their Lordships will no doubt desire to have further details at a later stage than can conveniently be furnished at the moment, but in order that the Board may be in a position to negotiate with the parties referred to they would be glad to have Their sanction to the proposals outlined above, in so far as they would involve the probable provision out of Public monies of Â£160,000. In this connection it should be stated that it would be a condition of entering into the Schemes that a Government Supervisor should be appointed with power to consider and, if necessary, to ? any expenditure."

On the 18th September, the Treasury replied:

"The Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury have had before Them Mr. Payne&apos;s letter of the 27th ultimo (I.M.2850 C.T.A.1188) and the Minutes of the discussion at the Home Affairs Committee on the 18th ultimo, relative to two proposals for the grant of assistance from public funds for the development of the Flax industry in the South of Ireland.

In reply I am to request you to inform the Board of Trade that, after careful consideration of the circumstances and in view of the urgent importance of restricting public expenditure, My Lords are unable to sanction these proposals."
In view of this reply, a semi official enquiry was addressed to the Treasury on September 29th as follows:-

"Will you kindly look at the Treasury letter of the 18th September - 37782/19 - relative to the proposals for assistance for the development of the Flax Industry in the South of Ireland. It is not clear to us whether the Treasury refusal is based on a general principle or on the details of the particular schemes. If the latter it would be advantageous if we could know the particular points to which the Treasury take exception, with a view to alternative proposals being formulated; if the former we shall be glad to know what view the Treasury take of the decision of the Home Affairs Committee of the 18th August, which we interpreted as sanctioning State financial assistance to the two schemes, subject to the settlement of details."

To this letter the following semi-official reply was received, dated October 1st.

"The decision contained in Treasury letter of the 18th September about the South of Ireland Flax Schemes - which was that of the Chancellor of the Exchequer - was one of principle, namely that in present circumstances the Treasury is not prepared to sanction any addition to the existing subsidies or guarantees in respect of Flax Production.

I do not think that the Chancellor would accept the suggestion that, unless his previous assent has been obtained, the Home Affairs Committee is in a position to give financial authority: in fact I believe that he recently asked that schemes involving expenditure should be sent to him beforehand, if it is not desired to put them to the Treasury officially in the usual way."
