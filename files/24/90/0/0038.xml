This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Govenpteafc---&quot;&quot;9 p;SECRET. ^WAR CABINET.THE SITUATION IN RUSSIA.NOTE BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR. I circulate a few remarks on the Foreign Office paper of 3rd October on Russia.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.The War Office,15^ October, 1919.At the present time the military situation, taken as a whole, is such that it would be prudent to count upon the collapse and destruction of the Bolshevik power and its replacement by some form of Government based upon the forces of Kolchak and Denikin. This Government will undoubtedly embody the principle of a United Russia. It will consider itself the direct successor of the Russia which was our ally in August, 1914, and with whom we signed the Treaty of London on 4th September of that year. Kolchak and Denikin have, indeed, good right to claim this continuity, because they have been fighting since that date on our side, either against the Germans or against the Bolsheviks who betrayed.us to the Germans. Undoubtedly they, and all the national Russian elements associated with them, consider that Russia has received very hard treatment from her allies, and that at the Conference in Paris she has been treated as if she had been an enemy Power. Great Britain, however, has always been true to these Russian national leaders, and has furnished them with the means of securing the liberation and restoration of Russia. If we use our opportunities during the next few months, we ought to be able to influence the new rulers of Russia in the direction of a broadly based constitution and of particularly good relations with us. Kolchak and Denikin have apparently made up their minds to the independence of Poland, and probably of Finland also, though there may be some disputes about boundaries. They and the Russia they will represent will certainly never agree to the independence of the Baltic provinces, or of the Ukraine or the Caucasus.I do not believe, therefore, that it is open to us to choose between a &quot; strong Russia&quot; or a &quot;weak Russia.&quot; There is going to be a United Russia, probably quite soon, which will be much too strong for us to quarrel with merely on account of these regions. In any cast) we should not be justified in a policy of trying to divide and disintegrate&apos; an Ally, without whose exertions the war might have terminated disastrously at the very outset, simply because that Ally has fallen temporarily upon evil days. On the contrary, we have a record which will stand us in good stead in the near future if we act consistently with it.The practical steps which are open to us at present are the following :-(1.) To recognize the Government of Kolchak and Denikin as the Government of United Russia, and by so doing place ourselves in a still more favourable position to influence the course of events.(2.) To continue to support all the anti-Bolshevik forces so far as our limited resources go.(3.) To use our influence to the full in the direction of a broad solution of the-Russian Constitution. (4.) To strengthen Poland as much as possible with the help of the French and topromote an alliance between Poland and the Kolchak-Denikin Russia, andthus powerfully influence future Russian developments in an anti-German,direction.(BL9/468)  60  10/111  h&amp;S  7588\vo
By proceeding on these lines we may see in the near future a United Russia looking first of all to Great Britain as a friend and ally, and evolving a form of govern-ment modelled very largely upon our own. We should also be able to safeguard the legitimate interests of the Baltic and Caucasian States through the instrumentality of the League of Nations, in which Russia will, in the first instance at any rate, appear as a partner with the Entente. - It seems to me that this is the only policy which is really open to us to follow at the present time, and the more whole-heartedly we pursue it the more advantageous will be its results.The Foreign Office paper appears to be unconscious of the extraordinary changes in the military situation which have taken place during the whole of the present year, and particularly during the last two months, or of the rapidity with which events are now moving in the military sphere.
