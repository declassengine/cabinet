BOARD OF AGRICULTURE FOR SCOTLAND KT for week ended 23rd October. 1919.I. AGRICULTURE.1. harvesting operations by Tractor.Afpfiage vouchers received up to 27th September show that during the preceding four weeks 672 acres of grain were cut by the Board*s tractor binders, making the total acreage out to that date 821.    Harvesting operations in most districts have now been completed and the local engineers are engaged thia week in collecting the various tractors and implements and sending them to the Sale Centres named in %he Report for the week ending 9th October.    All the acreage vouchers for binder work have not yet been received but it is estimated that approximately 1000 acres have been cut by tractor this season.2, Wart Disease of Potatoes Order.Inspection of Crops of the Immune Varieties.On the 21st October a meeting of Inspectors who had been engaged this year in the inspection of growing crops of the immune varieties was held at the Board&apos;s Offices for the purpose of discussing this year&apos;s scheme and considering sug-;gested modifications and improvements which might be put into effect in future years.The attached interim report was submitted and consider-:ed and thereafter the meeting proceeded to discuss arrange-imente for next year.    It was unanimously agreed that the scheme was of great benefit to the Scottish Seed Potato Trade and should be continued and that it was desirable that, if possible, all growers of immune varieties should be notified of the scheme.    It was accordingly agreed that a leaflet and explanatory memorandum should be circulated as widely as poss-:ible in the Spring of next year, and that posters should be exhibited in markets.    Several proposed modifications in the working arrangements of the scheme were discussed and adopted.3,. Defence of the Realm Regulation 2M.On 19th April 1917 the Board issued a Notice (under Defence of the Realm Regulation 2M) on the occupier of Daill Farm, Barcaldine Estate, Argyllshire, prescribing that for the restocking of the farm the number of breeding sheep to be brought to the ground by 1st November 1919 should be 400. This Order, after enquiry by the Board as to the effect of the Scheme, has now been modified to the extent of reducing this figure to 300 sheep.4. Corn Production Act. 1917* Part i, Claims.Reference is made to the Board&apos;s Report for the week ending 13th August last.(1) a large proportion of the reports on the Inspection of farms and holdings for the purpose of checking the returns of acreage has now been received.(2) The issue of forms of claim has besn completed.    Com :paratively few claims have been, however, received, and en-iquiries addressed to the Board show that the conditions of payment/
payment are not, clearly understood.    $hehave, therefore, issued to the press ah toftplaiiatory notice which it is hoped will have the effect of expediting the return of claims.Of the total number of 10127 men.,applied for by th. Board for demobilisation, reports show that 9304 men have been released to  ate&apos;.:in. land bsamjwhThe total number of applications for small holding! received from ex-service men is 2, 387, Of these 622 ha been reported on0Gagle Estate;   Three farms on this Estate will be sub-divided at Martinmas first into 13 holdings.Gretna; The question of a price for the 1,500 acrg offered &quot;at Gretna has been discussed with the Directorate! of Lands. No agreement has been reached and a fresh vail jation  is to be made for the Board.Collenan:The Secretary for Scotland has approved tl terms arranged for the acquisition of 166.680 acres of w farm by way of gift from the Duke of Portland and 09.60 acres by way of feu.    The approval of the Treasury is awaited.3.

It is 1 proposed to make 5 New Holdings and 31 iifclar&amp;ements on these farms.II. DEMOBILISATION OF AGRICULTURAL WORKERS..la Applications, for Small Holdings.2. Small Holding Colonies Acts,
Inspection of Crops of the Immune Varieties, 1919.The scheme for the inspection and certification of crops of potatoes of the immune varieties begun in 1918 was continued this year on a much larger scale.   Every effort was made to, bring the scheme to the notice of all growers of potatoes.    Advertisements and press notices were inserted in all the principal newspapers; ciroulars describing the scheme and supplies of Application forms were sent to the Potato Trade Associations&apos;f the Agricultural Associations and the District Agricultural Executive Committees; and all farmers and merchants who had crops inspected last year were asked to bring the scheme to the notice of any neighbours who might be interested.    As a result of this propaganda over 1800 applica-:tions representing an area of about 20,000 aores were received, This represented a considerable increase over last year1s figures, The increase was especially noticeable in the counties of Perth, Fife and Forfar where the number of applications was practioally doubled.    Most of the merchants are now aware of the scheme and seem to be fully alive to its benefits.    Many farmers, however, only learned that it was in operation when the merchant who pur-:chased their immune potatoes asked for a certificate, and there are no doubt many others who either through ignorance or indiffor-:enoe have failod to take advantage of the soheme.   It is worthy of consideration what steps can be taken to reach such farmers.In view of the increased acreage to be covered this year it waa found necessary to augment considerably tho staff of Inspectors.   Most of the potato merchants who had acted as Inspect-:ors in 1918 were again available and in addition ten students who had just completed their course were employed on the recommendation of the Agricultural Colleges.The work of inspection began in the last week of July, It soon became evident that the work was to be carried out under very difficult conditions.   The planting season had been particularly late and before the crops had developed to any great extent a pro-ilonged spell of drought set in whioh effeotively checked further growth.     In addition a night of frost in July had done considerable damage to crops in Forfarshire and Bast Perthshire.      In Dumfries-shire where the great bulk of the crops to be inspected were of the wGrreat Scot&quot; variety, the crops ripened very rapidly and further assistance had to be sent to the Inspectors, in order that all the crops might be visited before the shaws went down.       In all cases where it was found impossible to determine by inspection whether a crop was pure it was usually possible to decide whether a certificate should be given by investigating the source of the seed and ascer-:taining the condition of other crops grown from seed from the same * source.    In most districts the inspections were completed by the end of August.Over 1,500 certificates have been issued.     It is not yet possible to furnish a full statement of the acreage of each variety certified /
certified and refused, but the figures for the mote common varietie grown in five of the principal potato growing countlea are given iimt the attached table.   The most striking feature of this table la tV/ high percentage of refusals in Haddington and Midlothian.    Variour^&quot; reasons may be given for the difficulty of keeping crops in the Iiothisna pure, but the main explanation would appear to be that owi ?l to the system of close cropping prevailing in the district the gro\$l is not thoroughly cleaned between the crops.   Owing to the deep cultivation practised, tubera remaining in the ground after a crop I lifted are buried very deeply and are not destroyed by frost by the time the next ceop is planted.   &apos;r (This is shown by the fact that groundkeepers are much more prevalent in parts of a field where the soil is exceptionally deep).   In addition, however, there is no douf that considerable ignorance prevails among farmers as to the charac! :istics of the various varieties of potatoes.   In contrast with the figures for Eaddlngton the peroentage, of refusals in 3)umfries-ehire is very small.   This would seem to show that growers in that diatrih ere more alive to the necessity of keeping .their crops pure than ai those in other parts of the country.The &quot;rogues&quot; present in the various varieties were mainly oil the common non-immune types although &quot;King George&quot; was usually mixe with &quot;Up to Date&quot; and &quot;Great Scot&quot; with &quot;Arran Ohief.&quot;    The pink eyed rogue was again found in &quot;Ally&quot; crops but other varieties, &quot;Up to Date&quot;, &quot;Scottish Farmer&quot;, etc. were also present.    Except If) 2Tife the stocks of&apos;&quot; ochar&quot; and &quot;Templar&quot; seem to be very pure.   Tli high percentage of &quot;rogues&quot; in Fife ic explained by the fact.that op or two fairly large crops had been allowed to become mixed.      The [ stocks of &quot;I&amp;ngworthy&quot;, and &quot;WhaVs Wanted&quot; seem to be badly mixed. In fact the results all tend to emphasise the fact that it is im-tpossiblo under present conditions to keep pure the stocks cf any variety whioh is being,planted extensively, and it, might be considd whether any steps could be taken to impress upon growors the dangei of growing immune and non-immune crops alongside of each other in tl same field.   An interesting feature of this year1Q inspection was tjp discovery in all districts of a &quot;rogue&quot; with rough foliage.   After I: some time this rogue was idontified as &quot;Barly Market&quot;.    The large; acreage of &quot;Arran Comrade&quot; is also noticeable. -  Last year only 53 acres were certified in the. whole of Scotland.    This year 480 agH are certified in the five counties under review.,In conclusion the scheme as a whols may be said to have ;)ustijj its inception if only for the widespread interest it has aroused in the necessity for &quot;roguing&quot;.    The great majority of merchants andl growers displayed the utmost willin^nasa to parry out any instruotiH for the removal of &quot;rogues&quot; and were grateful for the instructions to the recognition of &quot;rogues&quot; given by the Inspectors.       The intimation by the Board of Agricullnire and Fisheries that no liceno will be required for the sale in infeotod areas of poi^osa from certified stocks also incroases the value of the certificate,.and it may be confidently anticipated that the success&apos; of the scheme i:i past seasons will be continued in increasing measure in yeara to cc
