/12WAR CABINET*8 IJ G A R,&apos;&quot;&quot;MEMORANDUM BY THE POOD CONTROLLER.(1)1 have received from the Sugar Commission and have discussed wich Sir Henry Primrose, the accompanying Note on the present and prospective position of the sugar supplyfl(2) I was satisfied that it was urgently necessary to effect a substantial reduction in our consumption of sugar and consequently when rescinding the strike order restricting the domestic ration to 6 ozo per head per week,, I directed that the ration should In future be 8 oz0 per head per week and not 12 ozo as it was before the strike.   I propose, further, to reduce the allocation to manufacturers by 2b%, a reduction which I am informed will not have a serious    -effect upon employment in the factories *   These two measures will save about 8,500 tons of sugar per week and reduce our annual consumption from about if million tons to about lj million tons,, as set forth in the estimate of sugar require-ments attached to the Sugar Commission&apos;s notet(3) The Sugar Commission are clear that the private Importation of sugar side by side with Government purchases tends unduly to inflate the price in foreign markets u   I propose, therefore.- to issue an order prohibiting dealers from taking delivery of any sugar imported into this country on private account after the 1st January, 1920s   This system has been successfully followed in the case of bacon and dried fruits, and the interval would give the trade ample time to complete contracts made In respect of 1919 sugar, while as regards contracts for 1920 sugar, imports after the 1st January would be allowed under a licence provided that the importer (who would in fact be always a &quot;manufacturer) would be debited with the amount imported against his prescribed allotment.(4) In its Note the Sugar Commission states that the Sugar provided by contracts already entered into will carry us on to about the middle of February, leaving us then bare of stocks and of incoming supplies, and bare also, or nearly so, of any reserve on its balance sheet.   The proposed economies in consumption will.postpone the date of exhaustion by some 6 or 7 weeks, say to the end of March. Thus it would be possible to postpone until then the further ques-tion of price which the Commission discusses in its Note.   The objections to putting up the price of such a commodity as sugar are glarings   But in order that tho Cabinet may have before it all the considerations on the subject^ I think It would be only right that I should mention a suggestion that was put forward by the Commission at our conference 8(5) It was pointed out that we must go on making purchases so that at any given moment the requirements of the next three months should be adequately provided fora   The proposed reduction in our consumption Is not likely to do much towards an actual lowering of present world prices - probably the most that can be hoped for (and that of itself would be an ample justification) is that it will check a further rise in prices *
The&apos; suggestion of the Commission was, that inasmuch as an increase of price within.the next 6 months is inevitable, it might be worth considering whether an increase of Id. per lb. simultaneously with a decrease in the quantity that may be bought, would not provoke less resentment than at some later date. It was further urged that the extra ldk would have a most beneficial effect on the future of the sugar supply,, In April instead of an empty purse the Commission would have a reserve of some  6,000,000, and this could be used to postpone a further increase in price for some months, by which time it is possible that prices might have fallen and so have rendered any further advance unnecessarya(6) If the advance of the retail price of sugar to 8d. a lb. at the present time were the only alternative to the advance in April from 7d. to lOd., I should of course concur with the suggestion of Sir Henry Primrose.   But my impression is that when this matter was discussed earlier in the year with the Chancellor of.the Exchequer the policy decided upon was to maintain the retail price of sugar at 7d. until the next Budget^ even at the cost of depleting the reserves of the Sugar Commiss-ion,, with the intention that an increase in the retail price should coincide with the reduction of the sugar duty. I believe that to be the sounder policy, as I am opposed to any present increase in retail prices unless such increase is necessary either to maintain supplies or to avoic violent fluctuation of prices in the future.   The prospective rise in January retail prices is already disquieting enough.(7)   I have instructed my representatives on the Supreme Economic Council to cohfer with&quot; M. Vilgrain as to the possibility of concerted action. The French Government are willing enough, but they have always found it difficult to control their traders.(8)   I may add that the continuance of Government purchases of sugar, together with restriction of consumption and limitation of retail prices, appears to be inevitable for at least a period of two years from the present time,(9)   I ask the War Cabinet to approve the prohibition of dealings on private account and to intimate their opinion as to the time when an increase in retail prices should take effect.GEO.

/9 o rROYAL   COMMISSION    ON   THE   SUGAR   SUPPLY,;lophone No: SC/l449/l9 3, Grosvenor Gardens,Victoria 6960.ilegrams: HWP/HS S.W, lfc &apos;Sugar Commission,Vio, Londoni1st October, 1919,SfiEMOhANDTTM ON TIffi PRESENT AND PROSPECTIVE POSITION OP the sugar SUPPLY. --oOo---The Food Controller,(l) The position in respect cf the Sugar Supply has become so grave that the Commission is of opinion that it is absolutely necessary that the Government should come to a decision at the earliest possible moment in regard to the policy to bo adopted in connection with Sugar; and. in pursuance of that opinion this Memorandum is submitted on behalf of the Commission, shewing what the facts are, and what are the alternative methods that might be adopted for dealing with theme,(2) The subject was seriously considered in May last at a Conference at the Treasury( and   I would invite your attention more particularly to the following paragraph in a note which I sent you at the time:-&quot;In discussing this suggestion the Chancellor of the &quot;Exchequer- asked whether if we planned to buy enough sugar &quot;to maintain the supply up to April 1920, we could procure &quot;the sugar, and if so, whether.we could do so without &apos; &quot;exhausting our reserve0 Cn the whole we think the sugar &quot;could be procured, at a pricee But whether we could procure-&quot;it without exhausting our surplus is so extremely doubtful, &quot;depending as it does on so many, unknown factors, that we. &quot;cannot venture to make a confident prediction. If compelled &quot;to express an opinion now, &quot;we&apos;should be disposed to say that &quot;the operation could not be carried out without leaving us &quot;with a debit balance&quot;.(3) Four months have elapsed since that was written and it is now clear that the forecast was right in both respects * The contracts already made will provide sugar at the pre-strike rate of consumption up to the middle of Februaryi Every week on the new Domestic ration scale should save 8,500 tons a week, and if, when the Railway strike is over, we fix the scale at less than the 12 oz. per head per week which has been in force since February 1919, the secured supplies could be made to last until the latter part of March- But when they aro exhausted,, whether it be in February or in March, our Reserve, which In May was estimated at a^out  4,500,000 from Profits and savings on our Insurance Fund combined, will also be approaching exhaustion.   Any balance remaining could not exceed some  500,000, even if no loss of cargoes is incurred. This is due to the high price to which sugar has risen and to the loss of  2,250,000 which is the estimated effect on our finance of the heavy fall in the American Exchange0
(4) But we must continue to buy for future requirements, and. every additional ton we purchase will mean a loss of at leastOn Raw Sugar (about two-thirds ofthe whole)  13   -   per tonRefined   ...     ...     * * *     ...     ...       26   -        &quot;Thus it is clear that something must be done - and without delay.(5) If consumption is to go on at the pre-strike rate we should require in 1920 to purchase 1,760,000 tons, exclusive of Brewing Sugar.   Now it is conceivable that there will not be that quantity of sugar to be bought-.   But if the sugar could be bought it is certain that the price would be higher even than It is now, and the retail price of Refined Sugar may go to practically prohibitive rates.(6) The inevitable conclusion is that consumption must be immediately reduced. If we returned to the rates prescribed in 1918 we should save between 500,000 and 600,000 tons., which would be none too much, unless other countries followed our example.   It cannot be hoped that the United States of America will do so.   But France we believe would gladly co-operate and perhaps Italy also.   In that case .ur curtailment of consumption might be less drastic - more especially for manufacturers using sugar, whose operations have an important bearing on employment. But with or without co-operation on the part of other countries, reduction of consumption must be enforced,   The influence of high prices in that direction is not sufficient under present circumstances, with wages raised in proportion to rises In the price of food.   It may be said why should we starve ourselves while other nations gorge. But if the only way to keep down prices is to restrict consumption, then in our own interest we should do well to practice self-denial.,(.7) If we go on as we have recently i-een doing, in February, with the present duty, Refined Sugar will have to be sold in the shops at not less than lOd. per lb.  (and later even more), in order to cover the retailers costs and profit. An immediate reduction of consumption would postpone for a time the date at which prices would have to go up, but not for more than a couple of months or so.   Thus a rise of price within the next few months is inevitable.   The longer the rise is put off, the sooner it will become imperative, and the higher will be the jump when it does come.   It follows that as with reduction of consumption, so with increase of. price, the sooner It is effected the better.(8) Assuming the principle accepted, it would remain to consider what the increase should be.    Politically it will no doubt be desired to limit the increase as far as possible, But from all other points of view it would certainly be desirable to put our prices at once on a level with the current world prices. Until this is done it will be impossible to take the-first steps towards removal of Government control of the Sugar Supply: and, apart from that., great, inconvenience results from maintaining an artificially low price, more especially in its bearing on Exports,   The difference in price bot^een Commission Sugar and privately imported Sugar is also productive of undesir-able results. But in regard ti this&quot;it must be said that the measures recommended by the Commission would necessitate a reversion to the strict control of the war period, and a re-imposition of the prohibition of Imports and Exports of Sugar.
(9) This latter condition the Commission regards as essential.   The effect on world prices of abstention from buying by the Commission would be neutralised- if private purchasers w ere left free to enter the market and to pay what ever prices producers might demand. But it would not be necessary to make prohibition immediately effective.,   In fairness to the trade and In fulfilment of pledges given to it, adequate notice of the re-imposition of prohibition must be given: and the circunstances are such that an intimation that Prohibition would corns into force again on 1st January, 1920 would be sufficient for our purpose.   The Commission desires to urge very strongly that such a Notice should be issued at once, without waiting for a decision on the questions of consumption and of Price *   This would give ample time in which traders could adjust their dealings&apos; to the new order of things, and. the warning would of Itself have a wholesome effect in sobering speculation.,H,   W.
