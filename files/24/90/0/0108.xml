e  Prime   Minister presided.The Prime l in is ter said lie proposed to follow tht example that has been set by ifc, Thomas on the previous occasion ana hand in a statement in reply to tho statement then furnished by Mr. Thomas, and copies of the attached document (Appendix A) wore distributed to the members of the N.U.R.After they had read it over Mr. Thomas proceeded to raise certain points.He took some exception to the statement that at the last meeting the classification of grades proposed by the railway managers were said by him to be satisiac\ovj,  fie had only meant that it was in the main satisfactory.    For instance, it was quite satisfactory for goods workers, but in the classification of platelayers he thought one class could bo taken out and he had not of course seen tho classification proposed for signalmen.Sir Eric Geddes said that it was not, of course, meant that Mr. Thomas agreed entirely in the classification but that in the main it was satisfactory..Mr. Thomas next referred to the statement that we must not disregard the liability of the industry to pay the rates in question and pointed, out that in all other industries tho extra cost of wages was handed on to the consumer and the railwaymen would never agree to receiving insufficient wages to the benefit of the consumer.Sir Herbert rialkor pointed out that railway business differed from other business as if you increased the charges to the consumer too much you might reduce your traffic and actually lose in conse-quence of1 the increased charge.Mr. Thomas rejoined that as far as regards increased passenger fares the Government&apos;s anticipation that the amount of travelling * would be reduced had turned out to be completely w^ong,. **He next challenged the general accuracy of the, statement that allyg^^es had to-serVo i-n apprenticeship in tfther industries. It was quite true that their apprenticeship might be for a period of 5 years whilst tho railwaymen equally had to serve an apprentice^ shit) but it might last for 20 years, and he referred to a remark of Sir George Finlay, who stated that it took 15 years to make a railwayman.&amp;a next point was as to the stress laid on the advantage to the men of continuity of service.  He agreed that it was an advantage to the railwaymen, but it was equally so to the   . railway companies.   No railway company would dream of reducing its staff in a slack time and&quot;trusting to fill its ranks from outside when more men were wanted.
Railwaymen were really tied to their employera and he referred to theifirst, rule in the Rule. Book issued &apos;co all raiJjraymen which is to the effect that all persons omplo?o&amp; bj the co-mpany must devote themselves exclusively to the company^ service. He went on to point out that in his statement he had referred labourers in the engineering1 trades and stated that there were&apos; none of these men who did not get at least 33/- or more war wage.He criticised the reference to garden allotments as one of tlje privileges enjoyed by railwaymen and asserted that only vjh of the railwayman got allotments and they had to pay the same rent as anybody else.*Sir Herbert Walker said that on the London &amp; South Western Railway z% of the men got allotments and many of these had them rent free. &quot;Mr, Thomas said that he did nit think this was correct but he would look into it.Dealing with a reasonable standard of com tort Mr. Thomas admitted that it does depend on cost of living-&apos; feo a great extent and that if a standard rate was fixed now it would work out either too low or too high later on..More attention would have to be paid to the cost of living than had previously been.   The opinion of eminent economists differed widely as to the movement of prices/but the present tendency appeared to be upwards and no drop to 1914 standards was likely ior many years.He referred to the case of the admittedly low-paid man at 20/- per week before.the war.   His bonus of 33/- had been an increase of 16&apos;($.    Mr, Thomas contended that such a man is more hit by the increased cosf of living than  anyone else and asked what should be his minimum standard wage on the 1914 basis.    Some increase, had there been no war,would certainly have been given in November 1914.   He than took thu case of the. 30/- to 33/-* men.    The bonus to such men does not even com-compensate for the increased cost of living and their standard of comfort, therefore, is actually lowered, iHe criticised the paragraph giving the effect of the Governments offer, assuming that shopmen and other grades are treated not. less favourably than the Government propose to, treat the men in the Conciliation grades and asked whether this meant that the Government proposed to treat shopmen precisely in tte same way as other grades, as if so the previous. aecision that shopmen must be dealt with differently, i.e. they must follow/the awards in the engineering trades, would seem to be abandoned.If this was not the case the figures were meaningless or &apos;did the statement mean that a settlement by which the aoncdlv ation grades would benef it wouloUlead to, increased wage for the-shopmen?The Prime,Minister said he-would deal with this and other points later oh and me^time--Jr. Thomas should continue with his statement, &apos;
Mr. Thomas then asked what the Government offer.really -    came to. &apos; Did it mean an all round offer covering signalmen * and everybody else, if so he ought to have the figures for thewhole of the grades.He agreed that the Government had gone some way to meet thorn as to joint management but he thought the reference^ the statement as to strikes not taking place until after a given time was unnecessary.    Hailwaymen had never shirked full inquiry into their grievances and their difficulties had usually been  caused by delay.He asked whether the Joint Board would be nominated evenly by both sides and Sir Eric Geddes replied that this was the case.    He then asked whether all questions should be referred to the Board.    Under the Ola Conciliation schemes question^ of discipline could not, but he thought many cases should be referred to it.    For instance, the case of a driver who was reported for running past a signal at danger, and who was entitled to a hearing.    It might be necessary to have, local machinery to deal with complaints of this character and;he pointed out that the North Eastern Conciliation Board dealt with every sort of question.The meeting was then adjourned for a short period and on resuming the Prime Minister dealt with the questions Mr. Thomas had put.    He first took the case of the shopmen.He pointed out that their claims had always been discussed in connection with the engineering trades in other industries.The Governments estimate of,108 millions as the wage oost under their offer included an estimate for an increase to shopmen, but he. thought matters would be clearer if he gave figures showing the effect of the offer as regards the Con-ciliation grades alone, and he distributed a statement (Appendix B),Mr, Thomas said he would like to employ an actuary and go into the figures and he pointed out that the cost of the sidv-shows as given in the statement was much below the figure used by Sir Herbert Walker in the early negotiations.As regards Mr. Thomases request for the figures of the Governmentrs offer for all grades, the Prime Minister said that if he gave them, and they were not vet worked out, he did not want the N,U,R. to treat them as a &quot;jumping-off ground&quot;, nor did  he want to make a final offer, but the .N,U,R. must -really not treat them as a &quot;jumping-off ground&quot; as there is a very narrow margin to draw upon if railways   are to pay their way even with enhanced merchandize rates.The figures would be ready in a few  days, say, a week and would then be handed over and his suggestion was that the fiagos Board should be at once set up and should deal with the , proposed new standard rates.The question of signalmen he would refer to later.Mr, Thomas asked if they might have the figures as then (, they would be able to debate- the&apos;&apos;matter in the light of fdllerknowledge.    Nothing in the downward direction could be effected before September 30th of next year and no substantial reduction would then be likely.    The-y would consider the suggestion as to the Central Wages Board.
ft o^8. The Prime-Lister then referred to the question of -si^lmen.    The Railway Executive Committee /were considering-a new system of /classification for the railways on the lines adopted By the North Eastern Sp.il.way i*e, a system based on the number of lever movements, number of block instruments, number of telsnhone messages etc.    He could not give any -figure ;uuv/. as to standard rates as if he gave a figure now it would obviously have to be a low one and would have to be revised when the classification was worked out,Mr* Thomas inquired whether Sir Herbert Walker was drawing up a system of classification on the plan adopted by the North Eastern Railway and he was told that this was the case and then inquired what was the number of classes.Sir Herbert Walker told him that it was not yet possible to say but he would be prepared to discuss the number of classes say, in 10 days or a fortnight-,Mr. TJite&amp;B esid- that they must consider the case as a whole but it was pointed out to him that the figures for all grades, except signalmen would be ready at the end of next week.In reply le said that the men were in a state of great * expectancy and pointed out that if the proposals as to signals men were not available foi a fortnight wo should then be m Hovei,;jer.The Prime Minister pointed out in repl^ that the period for fixing standard rates lasted until 31st December and that in any case wages are stabilised until September 30th of next year.Mr* Thomas said thai the figures for the other grades were only amending figures on the proposals already to hand and he did not think that it would take very long to get them outHe did not, however, want meetings for meetings1 sake and would agree to a meeting say at the end of next week.On the question of discipline the Prime Minister pointed out that no railway manager would agree to matters of discipline on his line being dealt with by other managers and he did not think that the Central Wages Board - which he had suggested should deal with such matters..    If some other method of pealing with the question could be thought of he would consider it.Mr. Thomas said that they would consider tfihe whole matter and asked when the next meeting should be. ,  jThe Mine Minister suggested that the E.U.R. had better  &apos; have some discussion with the Ministry of Transport as to the iinmitteego \Sir Eric Geddes said that he would be willing ! see the H.UoB. on Tue-sday next.the 28th at 3 o&apos;clock in the -:ternoon on the subject of these &quot;Cojyaittees.It was also arranged $hat a further meeting should take place later, before the end of the following week if possible, after the rates proposed for.grates other than signalmen had Men supplied to the(*)-
APMHBIX A.In ymr statement when last I met you, on the 14th October, you enunciated two principles which you said wore involved -in the present appeal of Railway Workers for standardisation of wages.1*   Your first principal was that it must be ensured that the classification of wagov was such as to provide for the full recognition of the Trade Union principle of4 collect- . ive bargaining and standard rato, and this,, you said, entailed uniformity of classification for all railways, and simplicity, so as to avoid an undue multiplication of graats.The Government has accepted tho Trade Union principle of collective bargaining, and in tho proposals which nave been put forward, the classification has boon simplified as much as possible as between the various grades and various districts. Moreover I undarst^wd you to say, at our last meeting, that the classification prepared by certain railway managers, and handed to you by the Government, was satisfactory.II. Your second principle was that tho ratos fixed for the classes concerned must; be fair rates, and must ensure to the &apos; Railway Workers a reasonable standard of living, at least corn-parable with that enjoyod by othor trades.I do not dissent,, in principle, from this view . provided that the work is comparable and that the conditions of uRdloyment and all privileges and allowances are takon into account, and that regard is paid to other trades generally and not merely to selected trades and selected instances which are * favourable to tho argument in either direction.    I have to add, howover, that we must not disregard the ability of an industry to pay the rates in question;  and in connection with the Railway industry - where wages form such a lar^o proportion of the expen-ses - we&apos;must be sure that, after providing a&apos;reasonable mimimom standard, having regard to the cost of living, we do not go to the length of crippling the trade of the country and injuring the prosperity of the community as a whole.I will nov comment up*-m some of your comparisons with the wagos paid in other trades, and will remind you of certain -important phasos of Railway employment which have a bearing, upon the point.Although in the case of the lowest grades of Railwayman we are dealing with wages which were too low before the war, a large part of your argument for the increases which you ask proceeds upon the ba;us of the wages of classes such as the follow-ing:-    Engineers, Bhipwrights, Electricians, Compositors, Bookbinders,  Boot and Shoe Operatives, otc,
all of whom are skilled men who have had to serve an apprenticeship up to as much as seven years of very low rates of pay3    &quot;Occupations such as these are in no sense comparable with railwaymen who serve no apprenticeship-..lou quote also building trade rates and rates for dock labour.    In both cases the nominal rates are recognised to be relatively high &quot;because the employment is of a casual nature, subject to frequent interruption by weather, etc. These cases canna^-properly be used in comearisonjwith railway employment wh^ch is continuous.    This point is emphasised by the fact that the building, engineering and shipbuildjjig trades were the first three&apos;&quot;trades to be brought under the compulsory insurance against uneioployment, because of the very great nsk; of unempLryinent which workpeople in these trades had to run.    So far as regards dockJLahour,that up to the present it has been found impossible to frame -3ny S jaeme of unemployment injmrance which -could be applied &quot; to this occupation, whereas in the case of Railway men greafo,&quot; -^objection is made to bein^inxCUded in any Nati^analjbcinma-&apos;of workpeople who may properly be comparedwith railwaymen, namely, labourers in ifte^-ejagin^ering trade; agricultural labourers and postmen.    It is true that you quote the engineering trade, but you quote only the skilled men whose wages before the war were round about 38/- or 40/- aifeek. Amongst the labourers in this trade you would have found &quot;rates ranging from 19/- to 20/- a week up &apos;to about 25/- or 26/- a weak* with an average of about 22/-.lour omission of any reference to agricultural labourers is important as it is fell known that the rates of certain grades of railwaymen bear a very close relation to.those of farm labourers.    The average earnings of agricultural labourers before the war were about 18/- a week in the South Midland and Eastern and South Western Counties; about 20/- a week   , in the South Eastern Counties, and in the North and West Midland Counties; a&amp;d about 22/- in.Yorkshire, Lancashire, and the Northern Counties.If the wages of postmen had been taken into consideration, you would have found that the rates paid to these men 21 years and upwards commenced at 19/- ,20/-, 21/- and 22/- v;er week according to the size and importance of the postal&apos;district.
Moreover, your statement takes no account of tho privileges of railwayman.   These include a guaranteed week;   cheap travelling facilities, (free passes and privilege tickets), holidays with pay, unizorm, ground for garden allotments etc. which greatly enhance the terms of the Railwayman&apos;s service, -        .......There is a.further point which requires notice -namely, to say as you do that you must insist on a minimum which will enable the worker to secure a &quot;reason^ able standard of comfort&quot; and at the same time say that this wage thus fixed must be paid for all time, irrespective of the cost of living, is an impossible contention because &quot;reasonable standard&quot;of cornyort&quot; must clearly be determined by reference to cost of living.  Your claim that the full v/ar wage should be added to the previous   . rate and made permanent, is one that has been granted to none of the trades which have made wage settlements since the Armistice * and although many important settlements have been made, none extends beyond August 1920,I would like now to put before you as clearly as I can the position as regards the Wages Bill ox Railways*Before the War it was  47,000,000 per annum.  At the present day - as nearly as it can be calculated -the Wages Bill is  115,000,000 (one hundred and fifteen, million pounds), per annum, and so far as the railway Conciliation Grades are concerned, these wages are guaranteed until 30th September, 1920,The Government1s offer - assuming that shopmen and other grades are treated no loss favourably than the Government have proposed to treat men in the Conciliation Grades - involves  108,000,000 as a permanent standard wage bill, to which, at the present time, must be added the residue of the war wage, which continues in any event until September next.In this connection I would point out that after giving full credit for Government traffic the amount the Government will have to make good out of public funds is estimated at  45,000,000 for the currant financial yaar, end to meet this an addition of at least 50/;? on the freight rates on the average will be required, as well as the retention of the present increases in Passenger fares,   A white paper &quot;showing how this  45,000^000&quot; is arrived at will be laid on the table of the House shortly,lou have urged upon the Government the adoption of a standard wage arrived at by the method of adopting the highest wage paid to any grade in any part of the country plus the full war wage. So far as we can see. and assuming that shopmen are treated in no less favourable a way than the Grades to which your application applies, such a standard would have the effect of approximately increasing the  wages bill to  125,000,000,  *
I have given very careful consideration to the various points which were raised during&apos; our discussions both before, during and after the strike, and I have the following proposals to make to you.You raised particularly the question of the wages of guards. The Government is prepared to improve to - slight extent the position of the passengers and goods guards, and in doing so, I wish frankly to point out that this will enable any questions which you may raise on the merits of any lower-paid grade to be more generously dealt with than under the previous proposals, while still retaining suitable gradations  in the rates for each grade.As regards the minimum, rate of 40/the Government would be prepared in the megptiations which will take place, to consider any representations to the effect  that this minimum wage- if and when it comes into force - may operate unfairly when applied to the towns or districts of the country where living ;.is higher than in the rural areas.It is, of course, clear that no redaction in the wages of any grade shall take place unless upon a review of the whole question of war wages in August of next year, but it* is desirable, as you have pointed outr that new standard rates should be fixed, and then when the war wage is reviewed, in accordance with that agreement, the situa-tion oan be dealt with on a more satisfactory basis and with more knowledge then is possible to-day.I have given consideration to the proposals which you handed to me at our last meeting as to your Trade Union Scheme for the control of Railways.. This sc&amp;eme involves nationalisation of Railways and Joint management of a charac-ter which is impossible during the two years of Government control, which is provided for in the Ministry of Transport Bill.I see. however, that in your proposals you have a provision that all applications for changes in general conditions of service shall be remitted    your proposed Board of Control,I think we must all agree that every possible step should be taken not only to prevent the dislocation to the country involved in a railway strike, but to provide a ready method for adjustment of any difficulties for which the Railway Workers seek a remedy, I suggest, accordingly, that we should adopt at onct that part of your proposals which would be applicable, and pt up a ventral Wages Board of perhaps 10 or 8 persons, half of whom should consist of nominees of the Railway Administration, and half of nominees of the workers of the Railways. All general questions of conditions of service and pay should be referred to this Board % Palling agreement amongst the members of the Board, any matter in dispute should be referred to a National Wsges, Board, oonsisting of three equal parts: Railway workers.  Bailway administration, and users of the Railways, together witn an independent Chairman. This National Board should, within one montn of any matter being referred to them, publish tne result of their investigations and consideration of the matter, and until after that re^ilt has been made public, no strike should take place.It might, of course. be found convenient to appoint District Boards, under the Central Board,.which could deal with minor matters. These would not come before the Central Board, except in the case of a dispute..These suggestions, and the scope and functions of the Boards, the Government would be prepared to discuss with you.

Appendix 0There is a fcrther point whioh arises out of the proposals you have laid before me which I should like to mention, as it bears upon the desire of the men to &quot;be brought into closer touch with tho management of the Hallways,    It will be within your knowledge that during the far. and whilst the Government&apos; have heen in possession of the Railways under the Act of 1871, they have exercised their powers Plough an Executive Committee of general managers with the President of the Board of Trade as Chairman, hut now that the war has oeased, and the Ministry of Transport Act has &quot;become law^ the executive functions of this Committee have passed under the Act to the Minister of Transport. But although the functions of the Committee havo ceasod to he executive, the Government consider it necessary that a Railway ,  Committee, not constituted exactly on the same lines as the Executive Committee, should he set up for the purpose of giving advice to the Government on matters which closely affect the interests of the Railways and of the State&quot;in relation to the Railways.    If it is the desire of ihe man, as I &quot;believe it to be, that they should have representation upon such a Committee,&apos; the Government would he glad to see one or more Retilw&amp;y workers, as the Minister of Transport may think desirable, appointed members of this Committee.     They would assist by their advice in the deliberations of the Committee upon matter^ brought before them.   It must, however, be borne in mind that Questions may arise in connection, for instance, with negotiations or disputes, when it would be inconsistent both from the point of view of the men18 representatives as Trades Union leaders, 6nd of the Railway Managers as representatives of employers of Labour, that the representatives of the men should take part in the discussions upon such matters brought before the Committee.    I do not suppose that any difficulty is likely to arise in regard to this, but I think it is perhaps well that I should draw attention to the point.An experiment such aa this, however, can only have the success which we would all wish, if there is a genuine desire upon both Bides to make it so.    Confidential and friendly relations are essential, and it would be a great disservice to the state and the future relations of employers and employed if anything were lacking to ensure such a relationship.
