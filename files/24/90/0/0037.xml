PARAPHRASE T^LEGRAIi. from the Acting High Commissioner for Cyprus to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.Dated 13th October 1919 (Received Colonial Office 3.29 p.m. 15th October, 1919)At a meeting of Greek Christian delegates representing Cyprus villages held at the Palace of the Archbishop, Nicosia, on October 12th a resolution for the union of Cyprus with Greece was passed, and telegrams on the subject were subseguent-ly despatched to the Prime Minister and others.    I ascertained from various letters which were submitted to me in the course of censorship that the meeting was not the result of any local spontaneous feeling but was organised by a lecal committee in-structed by the deputation of the Greek Christian members of the Legislative Council which is at present in England who stated that they wished to have their position strengthened by resolutions from Cyprus but that the committee must not divulge the fact that the deputation had inspired this as it was im-portant that the responsible advisers of his kajesty should have the impression that any such resolution was passed by a united people without dictation, and that great care should be taken to avoid giving the impression that it was the work of agitators-I have received from Moslems emphatic protests against the Greek Christian agitation for union with Greece and earnestly asking -that British rule in Cyprus may be continued.
