CABINET.FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE COAL EXPORT                TRADE*Note by the President of the Board of Trade.     I circulate to my colleagues a memorandum by theSecretary for Mines on the proposal for financial assistance for the coal export trade put to him by the Joint StandingConsultative Committee for the Coal Industry.   The Secretaryfor Mines does not find himself able in the presentcircumstances to recommend the adoption of this proposal, andthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, whom I have consulted, and I agree,with him in this conclusion.     The Joint Consultative Committee have several timesmade a strong request to the Secretary for Mines that theyshould be given an opportunity of putting their casepersonally before the Chancellor of the Exchequer and myself.The Chancellor of the Exchequer and I are prepared to meetthe Committee before a final decision is announced.  ,I accordingly recommend that a decision should be taken notto adopt the proposal for an export subsidy for coal, withthe reservation that the Chancellor- of the Exchequer and Imay raise the matter again should the Joint consultative committee show reasons which, in our view, make itdesirable to do so.Board of20th February,  193W.R.
          FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR  THE  GOAL  EXPORT  TRADE.              Metnorandum  Tpy the  Secretary.....for Mines .               f Previous  reference CP. .812(56) 7    1.  On the 13th November I received  a  request from the  Joint Standing Consultative  Committee for the  Coal Industry (the national Committee of  owners and workmen which was set up after the  wage dispute a year  ago) that  the  Chancellor of  the Exchequer,  the President of the  Board  of Trade and (in so far as Railway  Freight Rebates were  concerned)  the Minister of Transport should receive a deputation  to discuss the question  of financial assistance for the coal  export trade.  I invited the Committee as a first step to submit an outline of  their proposals,  and on the  Loth December they sent me a memorandum.   2.  The memorandum is  discursive;  its main contentions may be summarised  as follows:      (a)  It points out that exports of coal,  coke  and manufactured. fuel  (in terms of coal)  have declined  from  77,200,000 tons in 1913  to  about  35,8u0,000  tons in 1936.   This-represents a loss of employment  of nearly  200,000  persons  in  the coal  industry alone  -  mainly in the  Special Areas -  and a reduction of  some  40,000,000  per  annum  in the value  of  British exports.      (b)  This  decline, it  is explained,  has taken place in spite of the fact that the consumption of coal in markets  in which British  coal  is  interested is to-day slightly higher than in 1913.  Supplies  from other countries to  those markets have increased by 14  per cent.-  since  1913.      (c)  The memorandum  discusses  the  main  causes  of this decline,, but it  emphasises that  above  all the difficulties with which British  coal exports have  to  contend  are due to the systematic  subsidisation of exports by our.  principal competitors.     (d)  The memorandum recognises  that  the  Trade  Agreementsnegotiated by  the Government have to some extent safeguarded
British coal exports  in certain directions, and also  thatthe commercial negotiations with Poland in 1934 provided anopportunity for the United Kingdom coal industry to make anagreement with the Polish coal industry..      (e) Prom a statistical examination of the position in anumber of markets it  is concluded that at a conservative estimate some 22,000,000 tons of the coal export trade lostsince 1913 can still  be recovered.  The effect of such a recovery on Polish exports (and therefore on the Anglo-PolishCoal Agreement) would be &quot;redressed under any ordered arrangement of the international  coal trade by restoring to Polish, coal itsnormal market in Eastern Germany&quot;.      (f) The memorandum claims that numerous attempts have beenmade  to reach an agreement with other coal-exporting  countries,but the experience of the British negotiators has led them to conclude that agreement on a reasonable basis is impossibleuntil the coal industry is armed like its foreign competitorswith the subsidy weapon.  Details of foreign subsidies are        itgiven.      (g) It is urged  that, in these circumstances, the british coal export trade must receive financial assistance from theState, a course for which, the Committee argue, there areprecedents, e.g.  the  assistance to the Iron and Steel Industry,which led to an International Agreement, and the Tramp ShippingSubsidy.      (h) Having regard to changed circumstances, the  Committeedismiss as no longer valid the objections to a coal exportsubsidy advanced  by the Samuel Commission (1925) on page 224 oftheir Report (Cmd.  2600 ).     (i) The memorandum proposes,  therefore, that, subject to the submission of a satisfactory scheme, a sum of money should beprovided by Parliament to  enable reduced prices for coal forexport to  be quoted where  necessary.  A prior charge  on this                          -2-
fund would be the restoration to collieries of the loss causedby the reduction in railway freight rebates. - Thereafter thefund would be concentrated on particular markets where assistance is necessary to regain trade.  The amount of the subsidy wouldvary in individual cases according to requirements, and administration would be vested in a central body with anindependent chairman - with the necessary provisions forsatisfying the Government as to the use made of the fund.     (j) The ultimate object of the scheme would he the securingof an international agreement which would secure a fair shareof the coal export market for the United Kingdom and an economiclevel of prices.  It is suggested that the existence of thepower to subsidise might lead so rapidly to the conclusion of suchan agreement that the fund would not in fact have to he used.     (k) No estimate is made of the sum that v/ould be required,though in certain cases as much as 5/- per ton is envisaged asbeing necessary.   3.  On the 28th January I mot the Committee and, withoutprejudice, discussed their memorandum.  I was accompanied &quot;by officials of the Treasury and the Board of Trade.   4.  I suggested to the Committee that a time, when, as atpresent, the demand for coal both inland and export, was risingrapidly, and when there was indeed some shortage of supplies,was singularly inopportune to ask for financial assistance.  TheCommittee affected to regard the present brisk demand as atemporary phase and stressed that their proposal was a longterm policy.  This may be so, but certainly from a political pointof view, the present stringency.of supplies would not make iteasy to defend a subsidy proposal now in Parliament.   5.  I pointed out to the Committee that, at a time when the taxpayer was having to pay more for his coal (the inland priceof coal has risen considerably in the past few months) ho might                           -3-
well object  to Government  revenue being used  to assist  theindustry to  subsidise exports.  He might urge, with  some  showof reason, that some of  the  increased proceeds now being obtained in  the inland market  should be devoted to assistingexports.  The Committee  replied that, as I was aware,  such aproposal was not practical politics (in other words,  the  inlanddistricts are not prepared to  help the export districts)  andthat the use for this purpose  of the proceeds of taxation couldbe justified by the consequential saving on unproductiveexpenditure  (e.g. , unemployment assistance).   6. The next consideration - and a most important  one - towhich I referred the Committee is the situation of the scandinavian and Baltic  markets.  These countries have, underthe Trade Agreements, undertaken to take a specified  proportionof their coal exports from the United Kingdom.  In 1936 exportsto these eight countries amounted to more than 9,250,000  tons.In return assurances on  prices have been given to them by thecoal trade, of which a specimen copy is annexed.  At  themoment discussions are proceeding with Prance which,  ifsuccessful, will extend  a  similar assurance to exports  to thatcountry also, to which we ex-ported in 1936 7,250,000  tons(which will be increased in  1937 unless the negotiations  inquestion fail, to  about  9,25o,O0u tons).  In all, therefore,some 19,000,000 tons will in future be covered by priceassurances of this nature.   7. It appears to me that  if prices to buyers in any othermarket are reduced as a  result of subsidisation buyers in theseguaranteed markets would be  entitled to claim a similar reduction.On a basis of 5/-  per ton (the figure mentioned as possible),this would involve an expenditure of some  4-g- million on  trade which is guaranteed.   The Committee challenged this  interpretation of the assurances.   In their view,  the recipients of  the assurances are not entitled  to price reductions because they may
have been  given  in  individual  cases  and for  special  reasons  toother buyers.  They claim  that  all  that  the  assurances do  is toprotect  the  recipients against  price increases, and  that at  themost the countries concerned could only claim  equality oftreatment  if reductions were made by concerted action  in thegeneral  level of prices charged to other foreign buyers.   8. I feel bound to point out that, whether  the  assurancesare on a narrow  reading susceptible of the interpretation  sought to be put  on them by the coal  industry or not, the clear understanding between the  Governments as parties to  thenegotiations was that the  assurances constituted an  undertaking that the guaranteed position of United ivingdum coal  in thosemarkets would not be exploited  by charging them higher pricesthan might be charged to other  foreign buyers - in other words,that they would  get the advantage of the lowest market price.   9. The Committee were further of  the opinion that,  whatevermight be the legal position, the &quot;assurance&quot; countries wouldnot in fact insist on a narrow  interpretation of their rights.They would appreciate that subsidisation was being carried ononly in a limited field and for special purposes, and  wouldadopt a &quot;reasonable5&apos; attitude towards it.  This seems  to me, tosay the least of it, optimistic, when the avowed object ofsubsidisation wo uld be to bring abcu t an international agreement to remove competition in the export market and increase thelevel of coal prices to be paid by, among others, consumers inthese same countries.   lo.  There is another difficulty in connection with  the trade agreements.  I have referred, in paragraph 5, to the probable attitude towards a subsidy of the consumer and taxpayer ingeneral but there is this further point:   I have no  doubt thatif a subsidy were given, there  would be strong pressure from
those industries who claim that their interests were prejudiced,when the Trade Agreements were made, in favour of an additionalmarket for our coal exports, for the denunciation or revisionof the Agreements.  They would argue, not unreasonably,- that thecoal trade should not be defended twice over at their expenseand that, with a subsidy, the need for the coal provisions ofthe Agreements would no. lunger exist.  It would be very difficultto resist such pressure.   11.  There is the further consideration that a subsidy toone export trade would be a new precedent and might lead to similar demands from other depressed export industries, suchas cotton.   12.  Finally, there is the question of the amount of trade which might be regained by a subsidy.  The Committee&apos;sfigure of 22,o00,000 tons I regard as fantastic.  In my view,a figure half as large would be an excessive estimate.   TheCommittee&apos;s figure takes no account of political factors, norof post-war/ trends in economic policy (e. g.  the necessitywhich primary agricultural producers are under of finding a market for essential exports), nor of the existence of anetwork of fade and clearing agreements which fetterconsumers in their free choice of a seller.   13.  I placed all these considerations before the deputation.In most cases, as I have indicated, they did not agree with my appreciation of the position;   but they contended that evenif all I had said were true the advantages to be gained froma subsidy - viz. the trade which could be recovered and thegood prospects of securing an international agreement - faroutweighed the objections.    I doubt whether furtherreflection will change their attitude although it was clear thatto some at least (and especially to the workmen) the pointsabout the Trade Agreements were new.                          -6-
   14.  Naturally as the workmen were present, I did not stressbefore the Committee the doubts that I had as to how soon,if a subsidy were given, the coal would be forthcoming to fulfil any additional orders.  I have pressed Sir Evan Williamson this question of supplies during the past few weeks andone of the answers he has given me is that skilled labourand boys for the mining industry are at a premium.    Thismatter is being followed up in consultation with the Ministerof Labour, but if there is, as I think, something in thisallegation, it does not augur well for the success of a policyof financial assistance in providing increased employmentin the coal industry in the immediate future.   15. I am satisfied as to the desirability of aninternational coal cartel, but I do not share the views ofthe coal industry that a mere threat of a subsidy, or the useof the subsidy for a short period, will bring about such acartel.   16. If the Germans were so ready for a Cartel agreement that the mere threat of a subsidy would secure it on termsacceptable to the British coalowners, one would have thoughtthat such an Agreement would have resulted from the presentcoal position, in which everybody can sell any coal they can produce and only the absence of Agreement prevents good export prices for all.  Germany has not, of course, advanced atpresent anywhere near to this  position and there will be astern fight before the basis of permanent shares of tradeunder an International Coal Cartel is settled.  Our people are not prepared to have a Cartel on the basis of presentshares of trade.   17. With every desire, therefore, to do something for theSpecial Areas, which in the case of coal means the exportdistricts, and bearing in mind the view expressed by theChancellor of the Exchequer that unorthodox methods may
be adopted for assisting these areas, I am hound to say thatI cannot regard the case put forward by the industry for financial assistance as convincing, and in the presentcircumstances I do not recommend the adoption of thisproposal for an export subsidy.  18. Neverthelessy the rejection by the Government of theproposal would probably involve political difficulties,particularly as a  subsidy has been recoinmended by the SouthWales Trade Recovery and Expansion Committee (see CP. 212(36))and is  one of the proposals made in the recent Report(&quot;A Programme of Immediate Action&quot;) by the LabourParty Commission of Inquiry into the Distressed Areas,   19.  I told the Joint Consultative Committee that Iwould inform the Cabinet of their representations and let the Committee know the Cabinet&apos;s decision as soon aspossible.      m                                      H.

For this purpose the Central Council and the exporters&apos; Federation each in so far as they are concerned givethe following assurances which shall apply during such period as the Commercial Agreement concluded on this day&apos;s date betweenthe Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and NorthernIreland and the Government of the Kingdom of Sweden shall remainin operation.                      *   *   *   *   *   *   *   III.  rices.     Under the Coal Mines Schemes it is only possible to have oneminimum price for a particular class of coal for exportirrespectively of destination.     There will be no attempt, whether by means of the Coal MinesSchemes, or by the operation of concerted voluntary arrangements,such as cartels, monopolies, central selling organisations, or similar steps of governmental or private nature, whereby freecompetition is abolished or altered conditions of sales areintroduced, to fix higher prices for Sweden than are charged tobuyers of United Kingdom coal in other export markets.  Swedishbuyers will be left entirely free to place their orders in thedistrict in the United Kingdom where the conditions of sale at thetime in question are most advantageous,                       sic   sj:   sj:   :je   sj:   s    $VII.
