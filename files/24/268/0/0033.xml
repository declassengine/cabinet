THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet:  March 1937.SECEET.Copy  No.  41CP. 83 (37).CABINET,PROPOSED  INTRODUCTION  OF THE  SYSTEM OF  IMPERIAL                   PREFERENCE  IN NIGERIA.    I CIRCULATE for the consideration of my colleagues,  as an appendix tothis note, a memorandum on the question whether or not Imperial preference should be introduced in Nigeria now that  she is free from the treaty obligations which previously precluded it.  The memorandum has been prepared in consulta-tion with the  Board of Trade.  I  understand that the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs is circulating a separate memorandum on the subject.    2.   I should myself be in favour of Nigeria introducing Imperial preference.By  so  doing she would be following the example set  by  all  other colonial dependencies which are not precluded by special obligations from doing so, and she would be establishing her own claim to preference in other Empire countries.Failure  to  take this step might  be interpreted  by foreign countries  as an admission that we had doubts of the desirability of  the policy of maintaining thesystem of Imperial Preference in the Colonial Empire, although our faith in thissystem was reaffirmed by the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in theHouse of Lords as recently as the 17th February last,    The only  disadvantage from the point  of view of  Nigeria  would be  thepossible prejudice to the trade of her important foreign customers, Germany, theUnited States  of America, France and Holland, but all  these countries have afavourable balance of trade with this country more than amply sufficient to financetheir purchases of Nigerian produce.    3.   As the new financial year in Nigeria starts on the 1st April, and  themeeting of  the Legislative Council to consider the Budget has been fixed for  the22nd March and the Governor has. asked for telegraphic instructions, the matter is one of considerable urgency.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Initialled)    W. 0.  G.Colonial Office, Downing Street.        March 3, 1937.*[14760]
APPENDIX.     IN  October last,  as  the result  of notice given  by the  French  a yearpreviously, the clause of the Anglo-French Convention of 1898  which providedfor equality of treatment between  British and French goods  in  the Gold Coast,Nigeria and certain French West African territories came to an end.     2.  The  French forthwith introduced quotas and  tariff  discrimination intheir territories to which it had applied (other than mandated territories).   In theGold Coast no action is possible, since, under a Treaty  of 1871, the Dutch, andconsequently  all other nations with most-favoured-nation rights, can still claim the same treatment there for their nationals as for British nationals.  No obstacle,however,  remains  to  discrimination  between  Empire   and   foreign  goods in nigeria.  Advantage of this position has already been taken to impose quotas onall foreign piece-goods of cotton and artificial silk, which together comprise a third of the total imports of the Colony, and it is now for consideration whethera preferential tariff should or should not now be introduced in respect of other articles.     3.  The  total  imports  of Nigeria are now running at  the rate  of about 12 million a year.  This  figure may  well increase with returning prosperity.Rather over two-thirds of the total comes from the Empire, by far the greatestpart of it from the United Kingdom.    - 4.  As already stated, by  far the most important class of goods imported arepiece-goods of cotton  and artificial silk, the total  value  of the trade running atpresent at nearly  4 million  a year, of  which over  3  million come  from theEmpire.  Since 1934 the imports of these goods from Japan (whose most-favoured-nation rights were  terminated for the purpose) have been limited by quota, and,as already stated, advantage has been  taken of Nigeria&apos;s new  freedom  of actionto extend these quotas from  the  1st  January  to  such  goods coming  from all foreign countries.  This action was taken to meet the increasing competition ofimports from China,  which was disturbing the trade not only  of  the  UnitedKingdom, but also of all European supplying countries, and the quotas have been fixed on a basis intended to  cause the minimum of  disturbance to the trade of allother foreign countries.     5.  Moreover,  there  have  for  the last  two or  three  years been  specialdiscriminatory duties on various Japanese goods,  thus preserving Empire tradeto the value of nearly &amp;\ million from Japanese competition.     6.  The position thus is that Empire trade to the total of about  3 - 8 million,or nearly half the whole Empire trade,  obtains the assistance of either quotas oranti-Japanese duties.   The  remainder meets foreign competition  on equal terms.the foreigner enjoying in these articles trade to the value of about  3 million, or some two-fifths of the total trade in them.     7.  The  Governor,  at the suggestion of the Secretary of  State,  has now submitted a draft preferential tariff which he proposes,  if approval is given toit, to pass into law at the session of his Legislative Council in March and to bring into force on the 1st April.  At the same time the Governor proposes the removalof the  anti-Japanese duties mentioned in paragraph 5 above.  Under this tariffexisting foreign trade to the value  of about  1-3  million would  be penalised by increased  duties, and foreign trade to the value of rather under  1 - 2  million would  be  penalised by  a reduction of  the duties on  competing  Empire goods.Foreign trade to the value of  about  1-1 million would be unaffected.     8.  It is calculated very  roughly that the  amount  of foreign  trade whichcould be switched over by the  new tariff from foreign to British goods is at themaximum something under     million,  and perhaps considerably less.  So large a change-over could not, of course, be expected to take place immediately.     9.  The arguments against the proposal are briefly  these :--        *     (i)  It is undesirable at the present moment, when the &quot; Colonial question &quot;is so much to the fore, to give a further exemplification of the  advantages whichaccrue from the possession of  Colonial  territory.     (ii) At a time when His  Majesty&apos;s Government themselves in common withthe Governments of other leading countries proclaim their desire for the  freeingof international trade, it is undesirable to impose fresh restrictions on trade.
    (iii) The  United States Ambassador  has stated  that his Government  are&quot;&apos; very interested &apos;&apos; in the matter, partly since the change would affect importantUnited States trade  interests, and partly since they are most anxious to ensurethat at this time nothing should be done to increase tariff barriers.  The UnitedStates exports to Nigeria are at present running at about  f million a year, towhich must be added  tobacco manufactured in  the United Kingdom from american  leaf  to the  value of  some   300,000.   Of this  total of just over 1 million,  trade to the value of about  f million would be adversely affected bythe proposed tariff.   It is perhaps  undesirable at the present juncture, whennegotiations for a trade agreement between this country and the  United states are under  consideration,  to take any step which would antagonise the UnitedStates Government.    (iv) While it is  true that Nigeria exports to the  Empire about as much as she imports from it, and that many of her exports enjoy preference in the UnitedKingdom, half her exports go to &quot;foreign countries  and are more  than double in value her imports from them.  She would therefore  be in a particularly weakposition if they sought  to take retaliatory measures, unless the United kingdom were  prepared to come  to her rescue by using her own bargaining power.   Inparticular, the German market, on which her hold is  precarious,  is of value .toher.   In 1930 Germany  took Nigerian goods to the value of  4 million, or 27  percent,  of her total exports, a figure which fell in 1935 to  1-7 million, or 15  percent, of total exports. Her imports from Germany in 1935 were only  -^ million,of which some  310,000 would be adversely affected by the proposed tariff.  Othercountries with whom Nigeria has a markedly unfavourable balance of trade  arethe United States, France and Holland.    (v) The mandated territory of the Cameroons is at present administered asan integral part of Nigeria.   Preference could not be introduced there, and  its introduction in Nigeria  would therefore involve certain administrative difficulties and expenses.    The arguments in favour of the proposal are :     (vi) All other Colonial Dependencies which are free to do so have since 1932(and many of them before that date) accorded preference to Empire goods.  Theydo this both for &apos;c sentimental&apos;&apos; reasons and because of the benefits received frompreferences enjoyed in United Kingdom and other Empire markets.    (vii) Under the Ottawa Agreements Colonial  territories which are  free togrant preference but do not grant it may be deprived of all benefits of preferencein the various Dominions and India.  So long as Nigeria was under the Conven-tion  she was entitled to these benefits without reciprocity.  Now  that she is nolonger under it, she  may  be deprived of them at any time unless  she introducesa preferential tariff.    (viii) There is good  ground  for  arguing,  in reply to any complaints fromGermany,  that  the Anglo-German Payments Agreement of  the  1st November,1934, gives her a considerable surplus of sterling from her commercial exchangewith  the United Kingdom,  a proportion  of  which is at her disposal for  thepurpose of buying colonial raw materials after meeting her financial obligations in the United Kingdom.  The other three  principal customers are vulnerable toeffective tu quoque answers,  France and Holland  regarding their own ColonialEmpires, and the United  States regarding  their Colonial Empire and also Cuba,which is a pure foreign country and yet gives the United States preference.    (ix) The  change would mean an  increase in imports  into  Nigeria from empire countries, which might after a  few years amount to,  say,   f million, ofwhich the  lion&apos;s share  would come from the United  Kingdom.   The Board ofTrade have received a  number of representations from traders that preference should be introduced in Nigeria, and the failure to do so might arouse considerable criticism.    (x)  The French  have already  imposed restrictions on foreign trade in their territories which were previously covered by the Convention  apparently withoutprovoking  any reaction  in foreign countries.     (xi) The introduction of preference may make it possible  to remove the anti-Japanese duties, but if  this is done without any quid pro quo  from Japan, it mayhe  necessary  to reimpose  them  if  Japanese  imports of  these goods  reachformidable dimensions.
