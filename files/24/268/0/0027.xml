COMMITTEE  ON ECONOMIC  INFORMATION                   COMPOSITION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE    ON the 14th July, 1931, the Prime Minister appointed a standing committeeof the Economic Advisory Council with the following terms of reference :         to  supervise  the  preparation  of periodical  reports  to  the Economic    Advisory Council on the economic situation, and to advise as to the continuous    study of economic development.    2.   The committee is constituted as follows :              Sir Josiah  Stamp, G.C.B.,  G.B.E., Chairman.             Mr. G. D. II. Cole.*             Mr. H. D. Henderson.             Mr. J. M.

TWENTY-SECOND  REPORT.          Economic policy  and the maintenance of  trade  activity.    BY our terms of reference we are directed to supervise the preparation of periodical reports on the economic  situation;  and in accordance  with these instructions  we now submit  the twenty-second of these periodical reports.  as usual,  the report represents  the general  views of  the committee,  withoutattempting to express the different shades of opinion held by individual members;but Mr. D. H. Robertson finds that he is unable to associate himself to the extent that these  words imply with  the  views  expressed in paragraph  11  andparagraphs 22-26.    2.   In this report we are concerned more  with  the  question of economic policy than with an analysis of the present economic situation.  In view of this we  have not attached to our report  the summary of  the  chief economic events of recent  months which  we usually  prepare.    3.   This report was prepared before the  recent announcement of the  Govern-ments intentions  with regard to the extent of the expenditure  upon defence andthe methods of financing it.  What we have written on the question of  interest rates should be read in this light.

ECONOMIC POLICY AND THE MAINTENANCE OF TRADE ACTIVITY,    IN most of the  reports which we have submitted in the last few years wehave paid  greater attention  to the analysis of  the  economic situation than tothe discussion of general questions of economic policy.  In this report, however,we shall be more concerned with policy than diagnosis, because in our opiniona stage in the development  of economic  activity has been reached when it isdesirable that policy should be influenced  by the possibility that events maylater take an unfavourable course.  We are far from suggesting any immediateworsening in the economic situation.   The probability is, rather, that the presentimprovement will continue at least throughout the present year.  If; however,  theforces now at work are allowed to develop without control, there is a danger thatthey may produce a situation in  which a substantial decline  in activity will bevery hard to avoid.                            - &quot;    2.   We would begin by  emphasising  that the dangers which we anticipateproceed from a different quarter from  those which  produced the depression of1930 to 1932.  That depression was characterised by a great falling off in  thedemand  for British goods from  abroad.   Partly because there had  been nounjustifiable expansion of activity in the investment industries in this country,and partly because  the policy of the then Government was directed towardsthe maintenance of capital  construction  at  home,  there  was  in the  UnitedKingdom between 1929 and  1931, only  a  very moderate decline in the domestic demand for the products of  the  investment industries.  In 1932, indeed, therewas a  substantial decline in this demand; but  it was  in  the  main the resultof a change in Government policy,  induced by the critical condition  of  the sterling exchange.    3.   The  danger before  us is that the  present level of home investmentactivity will not be maintained  as  the economic situation develops.  It mayroughly be estimated that home expenditure on durable goods is  to-day one-thirdgreater than in 1929.  Up to 1929 the level of home investment was adversely affected by the peculiar  difficulties of  Great  Britain&apos;s  economic position, and,in  view of our present improved circumstances,  a material  increase  in  the absorption of investment goods  is justifiable.   Nevertheless,  past  experienceconfirms, what economic theory  suggests, that, in periods of  general activitythe demand for investment goods is apt to exceed that which it is easy to maintain,and that it is prudent, therefore, to anticipate a decline in demand within this field as a point of temporary saturation is approached  in  certain directions.    4.   We have argued in previous reports that demand  for British goods  forexport and home demand in the investment industries are of peculiar importancein determining the general level of British  economic activity.  The demand  forBritish goods for current consumption  in Great  Britain is unlikely, in general,to vary substantially, so long as the home demand for investment goods,  on  theone hand,  and for British  goods for  export,  on the other,  show no materialalteration.  But demand in these  two last categories  may vary substantially,without  there  having  been  any  previous change in the  level of demand  forconsumption in Great Britain.  Moreover, because of the general interdependenceof all forms of economic activity, an advance or recession in one branch is likelyto communicate itself to others and  thus to give rise to changes in the level ofemployment out of all proportion to that directly due to the original cause.     5.  We  have discussed  in previous reports the future demand for  newdwelling houses a  very important  branch of  the  output  of  the  investmentindustries.   The  conclusions tp which we  came were that it was  extremelyimprobable that the present rate  of construction would be prolonged beyond theend of 1938, that a recession in the course of 1937 was likely, and that the  declinein  output  would eventually reach very serious proportions.   The fact that  thevalue of building  plans approved for new dwelling houses has now for  several months shown a  marked falling off in  comparison with the  preceding year,suggests that  the opportunities  for  profitable investment  in  this field  are approaching exhaustion.   During the  last few years,  however,  an  increasing
share of the  total value of building plans passed by local authorities has beentaken by buildings other than dwelling houses, and although it is likely that thebuilding of new  dwellings will  decline in the course  of  this year,  the present indications are that the total activity of the building industries will be maintained for the present.    6.  Even in  1934, the  output of the investment industries was probablysubstantially  in excess of  their output in 1929.   But this increase  was entirelydue to the great expansion in house building.  In  1935 the output of the invest-ment industries continued to  advance, though the output of new houses remainedstationary; and  in 1936  this advance was accelerated.   We  can attribute thecontinued expansion in the  last two  years to two causes; first tb the demandfor new plant and equipment as  opportunities for  the modernisation  and.expansion of  our industries presented themselves under the stimulus of a revivinghome  demand;  and  secondly,  to the  demand  arising  from the  rearmament programme.  Direct rearmament  expenditure is  not in  the  same category as other  purchases of investment goods; but expenditure on industrial equipment,whether induced by the expansion  of consumers&apos; demand,  or by the  new demandarising from  the  rearmament expenditure, is exposed, though in a lesser degree,to the  same risks  which we have noticed in connection with house building, therisk that in time a point of satui^ation will be reached.    7.  In the case of houses it is possible  to make some kind of estimate ofthe rate at which the supply of houses is approaching the point of saturation,because there are  adequate statistics of the number of houses in existence, of thenumber of  new houses built,  and of the factors upon which depend the numberof families, which, in  turn,  determines the demand  for houses.  In the case ofindustrial capital, the problem cannot be reduced to such simple terms.  A reviewof the available  facts; however, leads us to the  conclusion that investment in industrial plant to-day is on a materially greater scale than  in 1929.  though we cannot say with certainty that in every instance  the present level of investmentwill not be maintained, in some cases, notably in the  case of iron and steel, thereare indications that even to-day  the productive capacity of the  industry is beingexpanded to a point at which difficulty may be found in utilising existing equip-ment,  except  in  the quite abnormal conditions of demand which  we are nowexperiencing.  In general,  we feel justified in assuming that the present industrialdemand for the products  of the investment  industries is of a character  whichexposes it  to the risk of a  setback, even though consumers&apos; demand for the products of industry is maintained, and of a substantial  reduction in  the eventof any falling off  in the demand  of ultimate consumers.    8.  The consequences  to be apprehended from a falling off  in the demand forthe products of the investment industries are of two kinds.   The  first is a reductionin the level of incomes currently earned which, in turn,  create the demand forthe products  of the consumption industries.  The second is the appearance of a surplus of  labour and productive  resources in the investment  industries  whichcan only be absorbed with difficulty into  other industries.  These consequencescould  most satisfactorily be  avoided by arranging, if it were  possible, that the flow of demand for the products of the investment  industries should be as regularas possible from one year to the next.  This leads us to the first aspect of economic policy  which  we believe should be  seriously considered to-day.    9.  We  can  no longer  anticipate that  the stimulus to  economic activitygenerally associated with  an increase in  investment will  make any substantialimpression on the remaining volume of unemployment.  If unemployment is tobe further  reduced, either there must be a qualitative change  in the nature of demand,  such, for example,   as might occur  if the exports of those industries which  are  not especially  active at  present,  e.g.,  cotton, could be  stimulated,or special  steps  must be taken  to  increase the demand for labour  in  theareas  where unemployment is the  consequence of  geographical maldistributionof the population.   One  of  the reasons why unemployment  diminished  muchmore  rapidly in  1936  than  in  1935,  was that the  revival  of the  demand  for heavy  engineering products, induced  by  the   rearmament   programme andthe increase  in industrial investment,  led  to increased  activity in  districts,.particularly in the north eastern area, where the  under employment of existing resources was particularly marked.  In the same  way, any material expansion       [14646]                                     &quot;               B  3
   in the demand for our older staple exports would now have a much more marked   effect upon total employment,  than a similar but more widely diversified increase   in demand.   Furthermore, even in the case of those districts which used to rely   on coalmining, the introduction of new industries, although they might depend   for the bulk of their specialised labour force on immigration from more fortunate   areas, would, by reason of the unused capacity of the ancillary industries in these   districts, such as building, transport  and distribution, probably prove helpful to   employment as a whole.       10.   Apart from the special areas the postponement of such investment   activity as is not of an urgent character would, on  balance, prove beneficial to   the average level of employment over a period of years.   For to-day, an attempt   to increase  investment expenditure would react  rather  on the  level  of profits   earned by industry than on the total volume of employment; whereas later, should   the total amount of investment activity fall below the minimum compatible with   conditions of  good  trade, the undertaking  of  the investment  projects  now   postponed would react favourably upon the general level of employment.       11.   Our first  recommendation is therefore that the government should  take   what steps are possible to postpone work upon investment projects which are not   of an urgent character.  Given time, the rate of investment activity can be reduced   by increasing the long-term rates  of interest; and if the influence of the govern-   ment was used to accelerate a rise in these  rates an immediate impression could,   no doubt, be made on the activity of the investment  industries.  But  we doubt   whether action upon these lines would produce the exact  effect which is required   to-day.  We do not wish to see a  reduction in the total expenditure upon invest-   ment projects over, say, the next five years, for our fear is  rather that in the latter   part of this period expenditure of this kind may be seriously deficient.   Yet it is   not unlikely that a substantial portion of the projects which might be postponed   to-day as&apos; a result of a rise in interest rates would in the event turn  out to&quot; be   abandoned for  good.   Moreover, because of  the inevitable lag  between  the   initiation of  a project and the full development of  expenditure upon it, a rise in   interest rates to-day might be exerting its greatest effect some time hence when the   whole situation may have been profoundly modified.  Finally, the influence of an   immediate rise in interest rates on projects which  could be postponed projerJ   that is to say, which are not required to meet the exceptional demand created oy   conditions of exceptionally good trade may be the reverse of that intended.   For   a rise in long-term rates of interest might produce an expectation of a further rise   in the next few years; with the result that it would seem wiser to advance rather   than  retard the effective date  of  projects of  this kind.   Quite apart,  therefore,   from the considerations which we put forward later in paragraph 25, we should-  not feel that  reliance upon efforts to raise long-term interest rates  in order to   bring about  that  selective  and  discriminating  postponement of  investment   projects which we  desire, would be justified,  and, therefore, we  de not advocate   that course.       12.   There remains the possibility  of direct intervention in those spheres of   investment activity over which the government exercises  some degree of control.   The most obvious  of  these are expenditure  upon road  improvements, railway   electrification, slum clearance  and other state assisted housing schemes,  telephone   and telegraph development, and  in a lesser degree other expenditure  on quasi-   public services, such as docks,  electricity and gas, water supplies, tramways and   the like.  AVe must exclude  in present  circumstances expenditure  on defence,   although in more normal times it would be highly desirable that  heavy capital   expenditure on  the defence services should be undertaken  when other  forms of   investment  activity were  at a low   ebb.  Even  so   there remains a   sub-   stantial  body  of  investment   under  some  sort   of  Government  control,   which may be used  in some degree as a make-weight to promote the stability of   investment activity between  good years and bad.   There  are,  of course,  well   known difficulties in the execution of  this policy.  To an important extent expen-   diture under the headings which  we  have enumerated is required because of an   expansion of  demand arising from causes over which the Government has  little   control.  The increase in telephone traffic, for example, is naturally fastest when   trade activity is expanding;  and except in so far as facilities have  been  over   expanded in the previous depression, it is impossible to curtail expenditure during   the  subsequent boom.  Furthermore, a  very substantial  part  of  the capital
expenditure of local authorities and public utility companies is required to extendnormal facilities to new housing estates, and is  dependent on the rate of housebuilding.  It cannot be anticipated without risk or postponed without injustice.Thus even if the government had complete control over the pace of  development in the services enumerated its use of its powers to prevent undue fluctuations in thelevel of investment activity would be circumscribed within comparatively narrowlimits.    13.  Moreover, the control which the Government can exercise over the rateof capital expenditure is at present very far from complete.  For example, in thecase of capital expenditure undertaken by local authorities under powers alreadyconferred upon them it is confined to the duty of giving or withholding authorisation-tion for the local authority to  raise money by way of loan and to the power ofpromising or refusing grants  from public funds.   Once the grant has been promised and the authorisation given the matter passes out of the direct  controlof the central government,  though, of course, the latter may still influence localauthorities by its advice. Yet the time which elapses between the granting of theauthorisation and the beginning of expenditure varies considerably.  In somecases  the beginning of work may actually anticipate  the authorisation by  a week or so; in others it may not occur until three or even four years  later.  Themachinery of control over  the  capital  expenditure of local authorities  is not designed to secure the co-operation of these authorities in the important work of using this expenditure as  a make-weight to balance the fluctuations of otherinvestment activity.   It is a matter for consideration whether the powers of thecentral  government  in this respect should  not be extended.   In  so  far  asco-operation  is achieved to-day, it is on a purely voluntary basis, in response tocircular letters which have been sent  out  from time to time explaining, theGovernments policy in this respect.  Moreover, the  willingness of local authori-ties to co-operate with the Government by postponing investment projects  to-daymay be materially affected by their desire to undertake capital expenditure at atime  when the costs  of  borrowing are low.   The effect  of an  appeal  to localauthorities would therefore  be very much greater if  it were reinforced by actionon the part of the financial institutions most concerned with the issue of loans tolocal  authorities.   Since the conversion  operation the order and rate of  publichfdes by larger local authorities has been subject to  generally accepted guidanceamounting to unofficial regulation by the Governor of the Bank, and this degree of regulation might possibly be extended so long as the  present investment situationpersists.  Furthermore, those smaller local authorities who  are dependent fortheir finance on the Local Loans Fund, may even more easily be influenced by thewishes of the government.    14.  The fact that the practical effect of a policy designed to retard,  for thetime being, the rate of public and semi-public expenditure is likely to be  of onlymoderate dimensions, is a substantial argument in favour of the view that it canbe adopted without risk.  The  last thing that could  be required of such a policyis that it should be so effective as to precipitate just those dangers which are. tobe feared from a decline in the present rate of industrial and private  capitalexpenditure.  Nevertheless it may be felt that more radical measures are required.In that event we would suggest that advantage might be taken of  the presentposition of the iron and steel industry.  There are very few capital works of any importance which can be undertaken without supplies of  iron and  steel, a-nd it follows that control of the iron and steel output carries with it the power to delayconstructional projects of a postponable character.   At the moment there is aserious shortage of iron and steel and the delivery  date  quoted for new ordershas already  been pushed forward  to a point at which serious embarrassment islikely to be experienced by consumers.  Nevertheless  the present and prospectivecapacity would probably be adequate to supply our average requirements overa period of  years, if only it could be arranged that these requirements  should come  forward in a steady flow.  A system under which the distribution of ironand steel was subjected to some form of rationing might  contribute to this end,and without causing undue disturbance to employment or overseas  trade  mightprevent too wide a gap developing between the enhanced capacity of  the industryand demand  under more normal conditions.   Any such expedient would mean anew departure of policy raising important issues of principle, and could obviouslyonly be adopted after every  aspect of the problem had been carefully considered.
We are so convinced, however, that fluctuations in iron and steel production arelikely to play an important part in the ups and downs of trade activity that werecommend that the question should be thoroughly examined at an early date.    15.  In making these proposals  for  the postponement, where possible,  ofcapital works other than defence works, undertaken by public and quasi-public bodies, we would wish to exclude specifically  from the scope of this policy worksundertaken, or likely to give rise to substantial expenditure, in areas where unemployment still remains exceptionally high.  Indeed, we think that as faras these           concerned,  an extension rather than a contraction of publicworks  expenditure is still required.    16.  We cannot expect that the reserve of investment projects likely to become available through a policy of postponement during  what remains of the naturallife of the present recovery,  is likely to be great enough to  bridge the gap in investment activity which must be expected to occur between the time when theindustrial demand for capital begins to show signs of  falling off,  and the timewhen it revives again.  For it must be remembered that this  decline in industrial investment will probably coincide with a more serious and more permanent falling off in housebuilding activity. This leads us to our second recommendation, namely,that the same public authorities who are  urged to reduce their capital expendi-ture to-day should be encouraged to prepare plans for a considerable extension oftheir capital expenditure to become fully effective  when the need arises.    17.  The regulation  of the capital expenditure of  public  authorities is notthe only  step which  can  be taken to  even out the fluctuations of trade activitybetween good years and bad.  Changes in the level of imports and exports are insome measure comparable with changes in the level of home investment becausethey alter the relationship between the incomes earned in  Great Britain and&apos;the-expenditure on consumption in Great Britain.  Thus trade  policy cannot  be wholly independent of the degree of activity in the investment industries at home.When  this is  low the reaction of increased importation on the  level of home&apos;employment is much more likely to be  serious than when it is high; and under theconditions  likely to prevail in the current &quot;year  we do not anticipate  that anyadverse repercussions on  the  level of employment are likely  to result from a readiness to accept increased imports, even if only a small  improvement in exportdemand should follow.  But this is an extremely  pessimistic assumption, and  weshould expect that a material proportion of any increase in our imports would be balanced by an increase in our exports which would create a demand for employ-ment in just those quarters which are to-day in a position to meet it.   Further-more, in so far as the exceptional demand now arising from our domestic situationfalls upon foreign suppliers, the consequences to home producers of a subsequentreduction in this demand are likely to be less severe, and thus a willingness toaccept increased imports to-day is likely on the whole to promote stability in the-level of domestic activity.  In practice, of course, the effectiveness of such measures as a stabilising influence on domestic trade is  considerably reduced by the factthat they are apt  to be pursued by all countries at the same time, and, in con-sequence,  to result in  unnecessarily  wide fluctuations  in the volume  of  inter-national trade, rather than stability of trade within the domestic field. Moreover,the level  of tariffs through which  effect can  be given to such a policy  cannot beraised or lowered  without regard to  the long period interests of the industries concerned.  Nevertheless, our third recommendation is that for the time being  weshould acquiesce in the growth of our imports, even though this may result in atemporarily unfavourable balance of  payments, especially in respect of importscoming from countries which  are  important  potential markets  for the products of our older exporting industries.     18.  The recommendations which we have made hitherto have  been directed towards the maintenance of stability in the field of investment.  If that could beachieved, we believe that the problems  in the monetary sphere, which have hithertoplayed such a prominent part in the  history of the fluctuations of trade, would prove capable of comparatively simple solutions.  But we must recognise that itis highly improbable that even the fullest practicable use of all the means opento the  Government of operating directly on the level of investment activity, short of a radical modification of the pace of rearmament, would  be  sufficient to avoid
either an extension of activity in the investment industries in the near future, ora serious diminution  in this activity later on.  In any event, the present level of investment activity is proving to be great enough to bring about a rising tendency in British costs, which, superimposed on rising prices for imported raw materials,has already substantially affected the level of wholesale prices.     19.  Some degree of instability of prices  must probably  be accepted  as  a necessary consequence of the ups and downs of trade.  But  fluctuations in pricebeyond  this  point have  generally  been regarded  as  likely  to  aggravate  theamplitude of fluctuations in employment.  For they encourage any tendency whichmay otherwise exist  for business men to abstain from investment  in times of falling prices and to invest to excess in times of rising prices.  Moreover, a belief that prices will rise is apt to lead to an undue eagerness to enter into contracts ofindebtedness  on insufficient security, which, when this belief  is replaced by itscontrary, are  only too readily determined; with the result  that the market for capital  goods when prices-are falling is unduly depressed by anticipations of widespread insolvency.  For  these reasons the prevention of any undue fluctua-tions of prices must be ah important element  in any policy designed to limit thefluctuations of trade.     20.  There are a number of measures which,  by general agreement, exercise a restraining influence on rising prices.  The first of  these  is the traditionalremedy of a balanced budget.  The rearmament programme  is one of the reasonsfor the present strong demand experienced by the investment industries, and itis  perhaps impossible to prevent  this demand  from having an effect upon theprices charged by these industries.   But the reaction of  this  demand upon thegeneral price level will depend in.  a large  measure upon the steps  taken to finance it.  If it is financed  by way of  loan the increased  incomes of those itbenefits  largely represent  an addition to the  potential  demand for other goods,and  must tend to raise the general price level.  If it is financed out of revenue,the increase in the aggregate of expenditure oh other goods  will be substantiallysmaller, and the effect will be to avoid (at any rate in part) the rise in the generalprice level which would otherwise occur.  We believe, therefore, that as large  a proportion as  possible of the increased expenditure due to rearmament should bemet by an increase in taxation.     21.   Secondly, all possible steps should be taken to prevent the developmentof unjustifiable speculative activity.  This calls more  for  action  on  the  partof the financial community than  on the  part  of  the Government itself.   Butspeculative activity takes so many forms  and  may so easily escape notice that itmay be  desirable for the  Government to take measures designed to reduce  thegeneral  level  of speculative activity, for example,  through an  increase in those branches of the stamp duties which would be especially felt by speculators.     22.   Finally, there is the question of monetary action.  The  changes whichhave taken place since 1931 have profoundly modified the  connection which usedto exist between short-term interest rates and the supply of money.  Moreover,the fact  that  to-day the Treasury  is responsible  for a much  larger proportionof the demand for short-term money than used to be the  case must influence the willingness of the Government to see rates  raised against it in the market.In these circumstances it may be  much more possible  and  desirable for  thefinancial authorities to exercise adequate control over the supply of credit withoutrecourse to the manipulations of short-term interest rates which are traditionallyassociated with this objective.  In any event there is at present a wide divergencebetween Bank  rate and market rate, so  that a considerable stiffening of ratesmay occur within the  money market before any change in Bank rate is called for.Although it is probable that,  because of  its importance as an indication of  theviews of the authorities and  the influence it exerts conventionally on borrowersand  lenders outside the immediate circle of the money market, a change in bank rate  is a step  of far greater general significance than any change in market rates,it  is not a question which requires  immediate attention.   We may, therefore,limit our discussion to the effects of the quantitative regulation of the basis of credit, however this may be effected,  without attempting to anticipate the precisechanges in market rates which may be entailed hereby, or to determine the extentto which the  short-term rate of interest may be obsolete, or weakened, as anessential means of control a question  upon which, in  such  an untried area,opinions must certainly differ in degree.
AO     23.  The basis of credit may be increased, maintained at its present level, orrestricted.   We regard the last of these courses, which might be expected to carry with it an increase in Bank rate, as appropriate only in circumstances in whichthere is a pressing danger of a serious rise in prices.  This we should define asa  state in which  it was plain that rises in wages were being demanded, and granted, on the ground that prices had risen, and rises in prices were occurringbecause wages had risen.  In such circumstances  there can be no end to an everaccelerating rise in the price level except through the use of the strongest financial measures.     24.  We  hope, however, that  no emergency  of this  nature  will arise.   Inthat event  the policy  pursued should not  be made to hinge upon its effect on thecost of short-term money to  private borrowers.   For we  believe that within reasonable limits this may fluctuate without any material repercussions on thegeneral business situation.   We attach far greater importance to the effect of credit policy on long-term interest rates, as expressed by the yield on government securities.   We do not all estimate alike the extent to which in the circumstancesof a boom new money created by financial action  can be directed to the supportof the gilt-edged market.  We are,  however, only concerned to point out  that the criterion of policy in  this field should be whether, in  fact, the creation of newcredit proves  to be a factor supporting the gilt-edged market  on the  one  hand,or on the other hand  a stimulus  to speculative activity.  In the first case it maybe persisted in, in the other it must be avoided.     25.  We  attach  importance to the  maintenance  of a level of gilt-edgedsecurity prices not far removed from that which prevailed last year, because webelieve that long-term considerations will require in future rates of interest  lowerrather than higher than those which then prevailed.  The principal ground forour belief is that the cessation of the  growth of population will carry with it agreat falling  off in the  demand  for new capital  as the  century proceeds.   the prospective decline  in the  demand  for  new  dwelling-houses which  we have discussed in previous  reports is but one instance of the effect of the failure of thepopulation to expand on the opportunities for new investment.   This prospectcarries  with  it certain  important practical  consequences.   Psychological con-siderations play an important part in determining the speed with which  the rateof interest is  adapted to that required by economic considerations.  As  a  resultof the very rapid  fall in the long-term rate of interest between  1932 and 1935it is probable that the public would not,  in the long run, resist very strongly afurther  fall  in  these rates from about  3  per  cent,  to,  say,  2^  per  cent.provided that general economic conditions justified such a  fall.   If,  however,.there should now be a serious rise in long-term interest rates, the public reaction in a future situation which called for a second substantial fall in interest ratesmight be entirely different.   The memory that on  the last occasion interest ratesrose again  after their fall might give  rise to very serious feelings of distrust asto the permanence of  any fall that might  then be sought;  and  the adjustment ofeconomic life to the new situation might be greatly delayed.     26.  Credit policy, however, is not the only means by which the gilt-edgedmarket may be supported.  At the  moment a  very large part of the Governmentdebt has either no fixed  redemption date, or a very distant one.  It is there for every vulnerable to  alterations  in the market  view of the long-term outlook  for interest rates.  If our view of these prospects is  correct, the Government  couldsupport  its longer term  issues through  the  offer of securities having  a  fixedredemption date, so far as the present  programme of maturities permits,  withoutincreased charge  for  the moment for the market  would probably absorb such issues at materially  lower yields  than those  now  obtainable in  irredeemableissues and without risk of  increased charges in  the future.  In this way it ispossible that the gilt-edged market might be  adequately supported without anyintervention through increasing the basis of credit, a form of intervention whichin present  circumstances we should prefer, if possible, to avoid.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,     February 19, 1937.
