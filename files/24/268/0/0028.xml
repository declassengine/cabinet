O A B I W E T                      I p                        Copy Ho;  ***SECRET,P. 78 (37)      PROPOSED SITE FOR NATIONAL THEATREMemorandum by. the First Commissioner of Works,          This is a question with which I am reluctant to trouble my colleagues,,   But certain influential parties are interested in the disposal of the site of Nos,1 - 7Cromwell Gardens, South Kensington, and, in view of the pressure which has &quot;been, and may be brought to bear uponthe Government in favour of a project which may be held to be of national importance, and of the possibility thatpublicity may be given to the matter, I feel that widerinterests are involved than those merely of the Office ofWorks, and that a decision by the Cabinet as a whole isrequired.          It will be well if I first recapitulate briefly the history of the site In Crozawell Gardens,,   This wasbought by my Office in 1912 as a site for a new Royal college of Art, the vendors being the Royal Commission for the exhibition of 1851, who sold the site in order that Itmight be used for the furtherance of artistic education.This is one of the principal objects of the Commission4sexistence   The Royal College of Art is administered bythe Board of Educations and is provided with accommodation&quot;by my Office in exactly the same way as if it were an ordinary Government Department.   It has long outgrown itspresent premises, and a new building would have beenerected on the Cromwell Gardens site If the War had notflxie dogttment  is the property of His  Britannic Majesty&apos;a Government,,
intervenedo          The price paid for the site was some  38,000,When the outbreak of War put an end temporarily to the schemefor building a new Colleges  the seven old houses on the sitewere used for military purposes^    Since the \7ar,  they havebeen let by my Office to the Institut Prancais du Royaume-Unij  but it was always intended that the site should eventually be used for the purpose for which it was boughtsThe Institut Prancais have within the last few monthsterminated, their lease and moved to a new building in thesame neighbourhood, and the houses are now vacant,,   At thesame time, the Committee on Advanced Art Education in Londonhave recently made recommendations as to the lines on whichthe future development of the Royal College of Art should run.,   I understand that the President of the Board ofEducation has accepted those recommendations, which involvethe provision of new buildings on a scale and of a kind forwhich the Cromwell Gardens site is quite unsuited,   It has,therefore, been decided that a site for the new Collegemust be sought elsewhere,, and the Cromwell Gardens site isno longer required for that purpose          After careful consideration, I have come to theconclusion that there is no other Government purpose forwhich the site could be used.,   It is not in an area whereGovernment offices are required on any large scale, and itis too small and on the wrong side of the Cromwell Road for it to be suitable for development in connection with theMuseums on the South Kensington estate   At the same time,it is an island site in a prominent position, opposite tothe Victoria and Albert, Museum and adjacent to the SouthKensington Underground Railway Station, and its potentialvalue to a private person who would erect flats or other buildings suitable to the neighbourhood is very great.
I have already received an offer for the site amounting to more than twice the price paid for it before the War.This shews that it should he easy to obtain a high price for the site9 and I therefore decided, with the agreementof the Treasm^s to advertise the property for sale bytendero   The necessary documents are now being prepared by my Office and the Treasury Solicitors   I was influencedin making this decision by the consideration that the priceobtained for this site will to some extent offset the costof erecting new buildings for the Royal College of Art on another site:  when I say that the roughly estimated costof those buildings is some  350,000, exclusive of the costof the site, my colleagues will understand why 1 am anxiousto obtain as good a price as possible for a site which wasbought for the use of the College, which has been held forthat purpose for so many years, and which is now found to beunsuitable.,          When matters had reached this stage, I wasapproached - and I understand that the Prime Minister andothers of my colleagues have also been apxjroached - byparties interested in the scheme for the provision of aNational Theatre,,   The Shakespeare Memorial National TheatreCommittee was formed before the War with the idea ofcelebrating the Shakespeare tercentenary in 1915 by theestablishment In London of an endowed theatre - not under government control   where the beat drama, both past and present, should he produced with the utmost distinctionand played by actors of the highest merits   Plays wouldbe produced on a repertory basis by a permanent company ofactors, which would also from time to time tour theprincipal towns In Great Britain, the Dominions and foreigncountries,,   The War interrupted the progress of the scheme,hut the Committee have remained in &quot;being and the funds intheir hands now amount to upwards of  150,000 - of which
no lees a proportion than  70,000 was the gift of oneIndividual,   The Committee consider that a capital sumof  500,000 is required for the inception of the scheme:&quot;but they are anxious to secure a site for their theatre,distinguished, accessible, and outside the district wherethe commercial theatres are situateds,   They consider thatthe Cromwell Gardens site fulfils these conditions, andthey are advised by a well-known firm of architects thatthe site is large enough and otherwise suitable for their purpose.   In these circumstances, they ask that they maybe allowed to buy the site by private negotiation with myOffice, without being required to tender in competition with private interests who would use the site for commercial purposes..   They base their request on the ground that (asthey say) several successive Governments have expressedsympathy with their scheme:  that other arts and scienceshave received support from the State, but that the theatrehas not;  and that the provision of a National theatre would go far to re-establish the status of the drama.          Departmentally, as First Commissioner of Works,I am primarily concerned to obtain the best possible returnfor the Exchequer from a site which is no longer required forGovernment purposes, particularly in view of the fact thatthe purpose for which that site was originally bought has still to be carried out, at great expense, on another slteQI consider that the best way in which this can be done isto call for tenders, reserving the right not to sell to thehighest or other bidders0   The National Theatre Committeewould have the opportunity of tendering with other interested parties, . If, on the other hand, the Cabinet consider thatthe Committee&apos;s request should be granted, I should proposeto negotiate with them on the basis of the offer which I  havealready received for the site, since that offer provides
the only criterion by which the value of the site can &quot;be judged,,   It Is possible that no higher offer might  he received if I were to call for tenders:  on the other hand,it is equally possible that a higher price might be  obtained,and in that case to sell the site to the Committee at aprice based upon the present offer would be, in effect,  togrant them a subsidy^          In view of the reasons for the disposal of the site, which I have set out earlier in this memorandum,I consider that there are only two possible alternative courses for me to adopt   (a) to advertise the Cromwell Gardens site for sale         by tender or   (b) to negotiate privately with the Shakespeare Memorial         National Theatre Committee on the basis that they         are to be asked to pay a price based upon the         offer which I have already received for the site.         If they were unwilling to pay a price, in the         neighbourhood of that offer, I should fall  back         upon the first alternative.   I do not think that         there should be any question of allowing the         Committee to acquire the site at any price         substantially less than the offer, which would in         effect be equivalent to the giving of a hidden         subsidy,          I have, I must confess, every sympathy with thedesire to establish a National Theatre.   If the TheatreCommittee had produced a scheme of building and endowing a theatre and had shown that their resources present and prospective put such a scheme within measurable reach ofrealisation if Government help at this stage were available,I should, even at a time like this, have suggested that  a
subsidy was jnstifiable0    But I should still have feltthat a direct cash subsidy was the proper methods    To hand the site over to the National Theatre free gratis  and fornothing would, it is true, be a subsidy of an open character,but to make such an offer is, in fact, far more than theNational Theatre Committee themselves have asked.    If, onthe other hand, they are pressed for a price baaed on (b)we shall certainly get no gratitude from them.   I therefore recommend that I be authorised to proceed as in (a), namely?to advertise Cromwell Gardens site for sale by tender-          I submit the matter for the decision of  theCabineto                              STANHOPE.HaMe Office of Works &amp;o*,  5th March, 1937.
