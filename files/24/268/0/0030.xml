THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT---- &quot;55                 Printed for the Cabinet.  March 1937.SECRET.                                                        Copy  No. 4 3CP. 80 (37).CABINET.                         SPAIN.POSITION OF CERTAIN OF THE BRITISH MINING COMPANIES IN             SPANISH INSURGENT TERRITORY.         Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    I FEEL bound to call the attention of the Cabinet to the serious position which has arisen from the action of the insurgent authorities in requisitioningthe products of the mines of Rio Tinto Company (Limited), the Tharsis Copperand Sulphur Company and certain other concerns.    2.   Since the occupation of the pyrites mining district by the insurgents atthe end of August last year,  these companies have been compelled to dispose of alarge portion of their products in accordance with orders  received from  theinsurgent  authorities.  Large  quantities  both  of copper and  pyrites have beenrequisitioned, partly for the insurgents&apos; own requirements  and partly for export to Germany and Italy.    3.   For the stocks  requisitioned for  export  to Germany  and  Italy  thecompanies are receiving payment of the sterling  value  from General Franco&apos;administration in pesetas at the unsatisfactory rate of 42 pesetas =  1.  At thesame time, before they are permitted to export to any other  country they mustdeposit the full value  of the exports in foreign exchange.  All requests made bythe companies to the insurgent authorities to be allowed,to retain sufficientsterling  to meet their sterling obligations have  been refused, in spite of the verylarge amounts of sterling  surrendered and of  the great value of the materialsseized and exported to Germany and Italy.    4.   Under pressure from Germany and Italy, permits to export copper to theUnited Kingdom have been refused to the Rio Tinto Company, and that portionof the Company&apos;s production which is surplus to Spanish requirements has been diverted to those two countries.   No raw material  has  been received by  theCompany&apos;s copper refinery at Port Talbot since  the outbreak of the civil war, andin consequence refining operations ceased in October, resulting in unemploymentin  a depressed area  and  loss of  markets.   Full  details of  these  arbitraryproceedings  are given in  a letter from  Sir Auckland  Geddes  to  Sir  robert vansittart which is attached to the present memorandum.    5.   As regards pyrites, the German Government&apos;s intermediary organisation,Rowak,  has recently requested that the three principal pyrites mines in Spain the Rio Tinto Company,  the Tharsis Copper and Sulphur Company and a french company shall contract to  supply  100,000 tons  monthly, accepting, ofcourse, in payment pesetas or reichsmarks.  The share of the Rio Tinto company would be 50,000 tons, and before negotiating  with the  Germans the  Companyenquired whether, with a view to their own future requirements, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment saw any  objection to the Company  accepting a contract of  this nature.  I  understand that that matter was considered by the&apos;  Sub-Committee onthe Accumulation of  Stocks  of Essential  Raw  Materials of the Defence Policy      9076  [14745]                                                B
Eequirements Committee, and that the Company have been invited to tender forthe supply of 120,000 tons at the  rate of 20,Q00 tons a month.  In his letter toSir Eobert Vansittart, however, Sir A.  Geddes declares that,  if the Rio TintoCompany fulfil the indicated requirements of their customers in countries otherthan &quot;Spain and Germany, including the order from His Majesty&apos;s Government towhich I have just refers-red, the Company will be unable to supply the quantitieshow required by Germany, which are, in any case, far in excess of her normalindustrial requirements.  In that event he fears that the Company will be ordered to give preference to German requirements.    6.  These  requisitions  of the property  of  British-owned mines call  forconsideration from three points of view:     (1)  Do they interfere with the requirements of this country, with particular           reference to our re-armament problem, and, if so,  to what extent ?    (2)  What importance should be attached to the fact that  Germany is thereby           enabled to  acquire large  stocks of raw material  suitable for  war           purposes ?    (3)  What steps are His  Majesty&apos;s Government prepared to take  to protect           the interests of the companies ?    7.  While (1) is a technical matter on which I am not competent to give an opinion,  I would, remind my colleagues that it is not only the copper-miningcompanies which are concerned in the question of requisitions.  There is reasonto believe that General Franco has guaranteed to Germany the export  of thegreater part  of the products  of the iron  ore mines of Spain  as, and when, thesefall into his hands.  There are important British iron ore interests near Almeriaand in the neighbourhood of Bilbao.                                    - -    8.  With regard to (2) it seems to me that a position in which large Britishindustrial interests are despoiled by General Francb&apos;s administration is-one which no Government in this country can afford to acquiesce in and that if these losses are inflicted  at the direct instigation of Germany, and if, as I shall presentlyshow, the German Government refuse to  take any steps to meet us,  a point hasbeen reached when His Majesty&apos;s Government must take stock of the position.    9.  Before possible  remedies  are examined  ft is necessary  to  be. clear asto the legal position. From the legal point of view the question can be consideredeither with respect to the  general provisions of international  law  or. to  theAnglo-Spanish Commercial Treaty of -1922.   I  am advised that under inter-national: law requisitions for reasons  of  public interest are not forbidden, butadequate  compensation must be made.  At the least, therefore, we are entitledto claim  on behalf of the companies adequate compensation, since payment at anartificially-fixed peseta rate cannot be so regarded.    10.   Under Article 4 of the Treaty of 1922 British subjects, and this, I think,includes  companies, are, with certain  exceptions not relevant  to the  present case,to be exempted from any military exaction or requisition.  I am advised that thereis good  ground for taking the view that prima facie these  requisitions appearto be of a military character and that it is for the insurgents, if  they can, to prove the contrary.  The Treaty of 1922 is,  of course, applicable to the whole of spain and is valid  in respect of the territory administered by the  insurgents.    11.   Action  has already  been taken vis-arvis. the insurgent authorities byinformal support given towards the end of last year by our Embassy at Hendayeto representations made at Salamanca by the Rio Tinto  Company.  It was hopedthat on  the  conclusion of the provisional commercial  arrangement of the 4thDecember with  the insurgents  the latter would  show a  more accommodatingattitude  towards British interests.  Unfortunately, no improvement has takenplace, and it is not even certain that the  undertakings given  by them under  thatarrangement are being carried out.  A representative of the Board  of Trade isnow on  his  way  to Burgos to investigate the position  with the  CommercialSecretary  at Hendaye.   They will  examine  various outstanding  questionsincluding that of the  copper-mining companies.                   &apos;.     h  &apos;    12.   It is extremely doubtful  whether any concessions will be obtained, fromthe insurgents on this occasion.;  I am confirmed in  this belief by. the unsatis-factory response obtained as a result of our recent representations in Berlin.  At
the request of the Rio Tinto Company,  Sir Eric Ehipps was recently instructedon general and political grounds we cannot hold the Germans legally responsible-to support the Company&apos;s claim for the return, or payment in full in sterlingfor a consignment of copper destined for Port Talbot, but requistioned by the1insurgent authorities and shipped to Germany last September.  I regret to statethat, according to Sir  E.  Phipps, the German Government have within the lastweek informed  him that there could be  no question of their  intervening in thismatter which they regard as an ordinary commercial one between Spanish andGerman private firms.    13.  In  existing  circumstances  there  is  no   prospect  of  compellingGeneral Franco to respect the rights of British interests by adopting retaliatorytrade measures. -  If, therefore, there is to be  any prospect  of remedying thisintolerable state of affairs, I am convinced that stronger measures are required;It seems clear that,  as Sir A. Geddes points out, the mining companies cannotoppose the will of a military commander in de facto possession of the mines.  this power has been exploited in order to obtain unlawful possession of their productsby an Administration  which is in effect relying on the political support of theGerman and Italian Governments to enable it to dispossess the British owners.By making use, if need be,  of our warships to intercept any ship which leavesHuelva carrying any such products to Germany or Italy we have it in our powerto end  this state of affairs.  While, therefore, we should exhaust all diplomaticmeans  of redress with  General  Franco,  I consider that we should let him knowclearly from the  start that  we are ready, if necessary, to apply compulsorymeasures.  It is only in this fashion that we shall obtain redress, and there is some prospect that, if addressed with sufficient firmness from the start, and  if he wereto receive  clear  knowledge that  we did not intend to allow his present course tocontinue at our expense, the. position can be remedied without too much trouble:We should not, however, embark upon this course without clear  determination-togo through with it to the end. I therefore ask for the CabineVs approval to thecourse which I have outlined above.                                                                  &apos;  a.  e:   I    March 1, 1937.

YOU have asked me the question :  &quot; Can His Majesty&apos;s Government  rely upon  the Rio Tinto Company delivering into war reserve stocks in England20,000 tons pyrites per month?&quot;    This tonnage is, in my opinion, inadequate.  I advise the accumulation of notless than half a million tons.  Even this larger figure would be  well within thetechnical capacity of the Rio Tinto Mines to supply.  As things are, however, Iam compelled  to reply  &quot; No!&quot; for reasons beyond  our control.  These are of apolitical nature and demand resolute political counter-action  in  Burgos  andpossibly in Berlin for their correction.    The following summary may assist His Majesty&apos;s Government to arrive at an appreciation of the present situation of the Rio Tinto Company.   A similar  fatethreatens all British  Companies operating mines  in areas  dominated  by theSpanish  Insurgents.

The following summary may assist His Majesty&apos;s Government to arrive at an appreciation  of the present situation of the Rio Tinto Company.  A similar fatethreatens all British   Companies  operating mines  in areas dominated by  theSpanish Insurgents.    The  summary is  designed  to   show  the   effect ofGeneral Franco&apos;s  actions upon the  problems of  maintaining the  provision ofsulphuric acid  and of  iron-ore, &amp;c, for the chemical, munitions and fertilizer(industries of  this country and her probable associates in time of emergency.

     The total annual production in Europe ranges from 5 to 6 million tons, ofwhich the Province of Huelva, Spain, supplies from 2 to 3 millions, and 90 percent, of  the Spanish  production emanates from Mines owned  and operated byfive British Companies registered in the United Kingdom.&apos;  The world&apos;s greatestdeveloped and potential sources of pyrites are&apos; owned by the Rio Tin to  company and  The Tharsis Sulphur and Copper Company1 registered in 1873 and 1866 inLondon  and  Glasgow.  Closure of these  mines in Spain or diversion of  their products to other than their established outlets  must result  in  crippling the chemical industry until an alternative and  costlier supply  of sulphur can besecured.     The predominance of these British-owned pyrites mines has proved to  be ofgreat economic and strategic value to Great Britain.   During the war years,1914-18,  the  Rio   Tinto  Company,  at  the   request  of   His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment          imported and created  an emergency stock of  over 146,000 tons pyrites     on the site of the Rio Tinto Copper Refinery  at Port Talbot,  South Wales;     imported over 70,000 tons copper for treatment at that refinery, and         used its credit in Spain to borrow and  place at the disposal of His     Majesty&apos;s Government the proceeds of a large Gold Peseta Loan  to defray     part of the cost of war purchases in Spain and counteract the intense pressure     on the British Gold Reserve and the falling Sterling Exchange.     In any future conflict between European PoAvers, submarine  and aerialactivity in the North  and Mediterranean  Seas appears likely effectively to stopall imports of  pyrites from  Norway,  Sweden, Italy,  Greece,  Cyprus.  Apartfrom Huelva, Spain, the only  alternative source of pyrites is Portugal, where one british-owned and one Belgian-owned mine produce together about 300,000 tons annually. Over one-half of this output has to be conveyed in small  vessels of lessthan 3,000 tons burthen, and any impediment in the narrow channel of the shallowRiver Guadiana would effectively cut off the bulk of the  Portuguese  production.     The economic and strategic  importance  of these British-owned  mines in spain, with their port of  shipment, Huelva, on the Atlantic, between gibraltar and the Portuguese Southern frontier, has not escaped the attention of the SpanishInsurgents or their masters Germany and Italy-all  of whom are using every means to exploit and  consolidate  the present  situation in  a  manner  mostdetrimental  to  the interests  of Great Britain and of the British companies.These  remarks apply equally  to the third largest pyrites mine  in  Spain, ownedand operated by the Societe francaise des Pyrites de Huelva, registered  in Paris.     In this connexion we  have to bear in mind that the pyrites requirements ofFrance and Belgium in a  normal industrial year  necessitate  the importation ofabout 700,000 tons, chiefly  from Spain and Portugal, and the production of othercountries is almost fully absorbed by existing consumers.     Since the occupation of the pyrites mining district by the Insurgents at theend  of August, the  sequence of  events  and  all  our  researches in  Spain andGermany give credibility  to the reports that a bargain was struck between the insurgents and the aggressive elements directing German foreign policy from theForeign Office of the N.S.D.A.P., together  with those directing the  Goring Four-Year Plan of economic self-sufficiency.     For the invaluable services rendered to the Spanish  Insurgents,  Germany wasto receive preferentially to the limit of her demands for consumption or resale      (a) all available  stocks and  future output of cupreous pyrites,  iron-ore,          mercury, copper, lead,  &amp;c, from  the  mines in Spain  and  Spanish          Morocco, as they came  under the control of the Insurgents, regardless          of the mine-owners&apos; nationality, and     (&amp;) part of the foreign exchange which flowed to the  Insurgents out of the          sterling and other free currency cheques equivalent to the fh.b. value          of exported products, and which has to be surrendered  to obtain the         ; necessary export permit.     (c) General Franco to make his own  arrangements for fixing  the  values of          : the  goods  requisitioned for Germany and for  compensating  with         . pesetas the suppliers of (a) and (b).    \d) General Franco to control the flow of minerals to other countries and          obtain political or other advantage by the use of economic pressure.
     The delay, in, capturing Madrid,and in. occupying the other  mining areas of Spain, coupled with the marked stiffening of the attitude of Trance and Great Britain at the beginning of January brought about some slight modification of the German Plan,  and the attempt was made to coyer the illegality  of the former proceedings by suggesting to the helpless mine-owners that they should voluntarily agree to make commercial agreements  to  supply  their products to Germany to&quot; the extent and for payment in the manner most convenient to Germany.        T     A chronological  record of the evidence obtained to date is  contained in Schedule!,  and a summary of the requisitions, so  far as they have  been reported to me, is given in Schedule 2.     An ominous situation has been created by the recent request of the  German Government&apos;s intermediary organisation, Rowak, that the three principal pyrites mines in Spain should contract to supply to.Germany 100,000 tons monthly,  i.e.. 1,200,000 tons pyrites annually, and accept pesetas or reichsmarks in payment;; The inducement held out to the pyrites producers was the  promise of  German intervention with the Insurgents to secure release of sterling to defray standing and other charges outside Spain, amounting in the case of the Rio Tinto Company to over  450,000 per annum.     This demand has been raised at a time immediately preceding the publication of His Majesty&apos;s Government^ White Paper on  rearmament expenditure, and the prohibition by  the Insurgents of pyrites exports to France, and concurrently with the instruction  of the Insurgents ordering  the pyrites producers  to load the vessels  for Germany preferentially, even before vessels which arrive earlier to load for other countries.  (See Schedule 1, dated the 22nd January, 1937.)    Under pressure from Germany and Italy, the Insurgents have refused to; give permits to export copper to the United Kingdom, and have diverted it to Germany and Italy.  This is plain robbery.    By extending other preferences to Germany, General Franco can ensure that the mine-owners will  supply the quantities of pyrites demanded by Germany on the terms prescribed by Germany.   Failing compliance with these  demands,  the Insurgents will proceed  to requisition, and non-compliance with requisitions may be followed  by forced seizure of property and goods,  and other expropriatory penalties apart from placing the safety and well-being of loyal British personnel in jeopardy.    Analysing Germany&apos;s demands  for  100,000 tons  per month, or 1,200,000 tons pyrites annually, I find that in 1929, the peak year of maximum  consumption, Germany imported from -                                                           Average                                               Year.       per Month.

In 1936  the German domestic  mines  were ordered to increase productionduring 1937.  This increase is estimated to be  at least 106,000 tons per  annum,of which our contracted customers, I.G. Farbenindustrie/Duisburger Kupferhiitte,have already purchased 60,000 tons per annum over the next ten years.    We have been unable to trace  any new  use for pyrites which can explain the. sudden  rise in  the demand for  Spanish ores to  100,000  tons monthly fromthe peak-year figure of 56,500 tons and the 5-year average of  36,200 tons.    I note furthermore that our German customers, in accordance with standardpractice, notified us in October/November  last year that their total requirementsof Rio Tinto pyrites during the. year 1937 would not exceed 269,000 tons, i.e.&apos;, lessthan 23,000 tons per month.    Germany is fully aware that the existing delivery capacities of the  pyritesmines in Spain will not permit them to  supply this heavily swollen  tonnage and
maintain their long-standing contracts with customers  in  other countries, and leave any margin over to supply exceptional requirements such as that requiredby His Majesty&apos;s Government.     Germany knows that the  fulfilment of  her demands must  create  an  acute shortage elsewhere, and has consistently exerted pressure on the Insurgent leaders to check or divert the flow of pyrites and other products from their usual channels,and thus hamper at her will  the provision of raw materials  essential to  the chemical and metallurgical industries underlying  the preparations for  NationalDefence in France and the United Kingdom.     I conclude that Germany is seeking to exploit the situation of the British-owned mines in Spain, not so much for her normal industrial needs as to ensureaccumulation of a reserve stock equivalent to at least one year&apos;s maximumconsumption of Spanish pyrites on most advantageous terms.     The accumulation of. this  war  stock can be achieved solely through  thedeprivation of other countries  and largely to the financial loss of the BritishMining Companies.     During the past four years the average pyrites deliveries of the Rio  TintoCompany have not exceeded 100,000 tons per month, of which Germany tookabout 20,000 tons per month.  Subject to the continuation of the  forty-eight-hour week in Spain and to freedom  from  inspired interference with  our operations,I  am convinced that the mines  can produce and load pyrites and iron-ore at. therate of 150,000 tons per month,  a total of 1,800,000 tons per year.   ...                                                           Tons per  ,.                                                                 Month.     The indicated requirements  of  our  customers other  than        .         Spain and Germany will absorb approximately      ...     110,000.

Any decrease in the number of the working hours  per week must diminishour production and loading capacities, and the situation will be aggravated byany  fresh requisitions imposed by the insurgents.   .  We know that the Societe  Francaise des Pyrites  de Huelva will be unableto provide more than one half of the  ore demanded by Germany, and we expect to be ordered to make good this deficiency; similarly,  the Tharsis  Sulphur andCopper Co.  (Limited) will not be able, in the near  future, to supply the require-ments of  its existing  customers and  comply with the extravagant  demands ofGermany, and we are likely to be called upon to make good this deficiency also.     We have already been made aware that the insurgents have offered to supply100,000 tons of Rio Tinto Cupreous pyrites to compensate the Nitrate corporation of Chile (Limited) for 12,000 tons of  nitrate of soda now lying in Spain, whichthe  insurgents wish to take over.   There  is also every  indication that  the insurgents plan to requisition quantities of Rio Tinto iron-ore for early delivery to Germany and  other  countries, Avhere enquiries  have  been  circulated toascertain what quantities could be absorbed by the ironmasters, with a commentimplying that this  iron-ore might shortly  become  available through. other thanthe normal  channels.   I attach copies of correspondence  exchanged  betweenNaylor  Benzon  and Co.  (Limited) of  20, Abchurch  Lane, London, E.C., the exclusive sales agents for the  Rio Tinto iron-ore, and Mr. Ben Walmsley.^)  Theunwarranted intervention of  the latter appears to require close  investigation.     I should mention that the whole of our limited output of iron-ore is alreadysold   to  the  ironmasters  in  this country,   chiefly  to  the  Ford Works  ofDagenham and the  Carron Company of Scotland.   Any diminution or  diversion of the supply of our iron-ore to this  country must aggravate still  further thesituation of our ironmasters at a time when iron-ore is exceedingly scarce.    Another flagrant interference with the normal operations of the Rio TintoCompany is the diversion to Germany and  Italy of our production  of copper inbars,  and precipitate surplus  to  the domestic  consumption of Spain.  As soon aswe accumulate  a   surplus and  apply for  permit, to  export  our copper  to port  Talbot,  this very valuable commodity is taken from us by the insurgents,V.&apos; &apos;  .;   &apos;              -         (&apos;) See Appendix:  &apos;......-...
 with the result that bur copper refinery has had no raw material since the outbreak of the revolution in SjDain; our refining operations at  Port Talbot ceased on the 15th October, creating unemployment for our skilled  and unskilled labour in a depressed area, the loss of our skilled workmen and the loss of valuable markets &quot;forv our established brands of refined copper.   Over sixty years of  refining activity in the South Wales area has been  brought  to a  standstill, and the country is deprived of useful employment in one  of the depressed areas and of a source bf supply of a much needed type of refined copper.     The Company has to provide the financial, technical and commercial resources essential  to  maintain its  valuable  properties in Spain.   The proceeds which should  accrue in sterling  to  the Company from its commercial operations, representing an annual gross income of from  1,500,000 to  2 million, are taken from the Company, and it receives for  that sterling 42 pesetas of  Insurgent currency for each  1.     The forced  conversion of sterling into pesetas deprives the Company of the means to meet its  2^prior charges for Sterling Debenture  Service,  for its  5 per cent. Cumulative Preference Share Capital,  and the  costs of maintaining the essential organisation in and out of  Spain.  There are  no means open to the Company whereby  it  can convert the steadily accumulating mass of  surplus worthless pesetas into  sterling or other free currency.     Frequent requests to General Franco&apos;s Government to retain sufficient sterling to meet its sterling obligations have so far  failed to produce results in spite of the huge sterling sums  the Company has been forced to surrender to the Insurgents and  in  spite of the great  value of the materials  seized by the Insurgents and exported to Germany and Italy.  This is an intolerable position.   The Company must get adequate supplies of sterling and any arrangement made with  General Franco must  ensure this.     His- Majesty&apos;s  Government must  realize  that the  ability of the Rio  Tinto Company to place its resources of essential raw materials at the disposal of His Majesty&apos;s Government now and in the future is subject to the political actions and martial decrees of a regime which is in effect  the cat&apos;s  paw of Germany.     Unsupported, the Rio Tinto Company cannot oppose  the will  of a military commander in de facto possession of its mines.  These  are a very valuable asset of the Company&apos;s shareholders.  In their interests, the  Directors of the Company are bound to  walk warily, to comply with every insurgent demand, no matter how extravagant or costly it may be, until  His Majesty&apos;s Government is prepared to enforce the rights of this British Company not spasmodically  but unremittingly. I am convinced that it will not be possible to safeguard British rights and interests in Spain until the insurgent regime is made to realise that His Majesty&apos;s Govern- ment is able and ready to afford with relentless tenacity the fullest protection to its national interests,  and  will not recognise  at any time  any forced seizure  of mines, property and products, as has frequently been demanded and recommended as the objective of many  supporters of the Franco  regime.    I.cannot  state  too clearly that His Majesty&apos;s Government will hot  get the pyrites and other products that  our national safety requires so long as Germany is permitted to seize for her own benefit British property.   A change of heart  in a German is only to be expected when he realizes that  force greater than he can command is opposed to him.  If, therefore, Flis Majesty&apos;s Government requires pyrites from the Rio Tinto  Company, it must be prepared before it embarks upon diplomatic action to resortif necessary to naval action to prevent Germany seizing our pyrites.  I also cannot say too clearly  that in my view any half-hearted attempt to change the situation will, if unsuccessful, recoil  disastrously upon theRio Tinto Company, but not only on it.  It  is, therefore, in  my view essentialthat  before anything is done there should be  a Cabinet decision to proceed,  ifnecessary, to the application of naked force.   Without such a decision faithfullyadhered to the position of the Rio Tinto Company would  be rendered desperate as the full wrath of the Germans acting through the insurgents would be directed against it.    I am informed that Sir Henry Getty  Chilton has not delivered the messagehe was  instructed to  deliver  to General  Franco.  This perhaps is fortunate.Nothing  should  be  done until His  Majesty&apos;s Government by formal  Cabinet decision has decided to see  the matter through.  I personally believe that to seethe matter through will, involve at least the exhibition, possibly the use of, naval
   -  The Rio Tinto Company and its mines in Spain are known in every inter- national market in every industrial country throughout the World.  To permit the insurgent regime, at the behest of its present foreign masters all-of whom are  inimical to the vital  interests  of  the  British  nation to  intervene with impunity in the transaction of that Company&apos;s legitimate business, to divert the flow of its products at will, to force the conversion of its income from Sterling into a valueless peseta currency, is to invite further indignities to British prestige and further loss to British trade and employment.  The experience of the Rio Tinto Company will become the common experience of all other- British mines situated in Spanish territories which may  sooner  or  later pass into the hands  of  the insurgent regime.   I am equally convinced that any hesitation or failure  to realise the importance of the issue will encourage similar flagrant breaches of the rights of British Nationals, not only in Spain, but in other foreign territories.     Without the assistance of His  Majesty&apos;s  Government, firmly  determined to use all the forces at its disposal to secure liberty of action for the British Mining Companies in Spain now and in the future, this Company must conform to  theorders and requisitions of the de facto Power, and it is for my guidance, for  theprotection of my Company&apos;s shareholders, that I request you to bring  these factsclearly before His Majesty&apos;s Government, and to communicate their decision andany counsel they can afford me in this deplorable situation.    Nothing that 1 have written is to be  read as meaning that the  Rio TintoCompany will not do its utmost in all circumstances to carry out any instructionsor  orders  it may receive from  His  Majesty&apos;s Government.   My intention inwriting has been to make it clear that as a result of  forces beyond our control,Germany,  acting  through  the Spanish  Insurgent Headquarters,  is practicallymaster in our house.                                                    Yours sincerely,                                                            A. GEDDES.                               SCHEDULE 1, DATED FEBRUARY 24, 1937.

At a meeting of German industrialists held  in Berlin,  convened  by the            German Government, presided over by the  Ministerial  Director Sarnow, the            question of deliveries from  Spain to Germany was discussed.Sept. 19.          Our General Manager  in Spain reported that &quot; the Insurgents demand full            payment in Sterling for all exports.  They will not accept Reichsmarks, as London            credit has been given by Germany and all their deals are for Sterling.&quot;            .    From the endorsements on the Sterling cheques surrendered to the Insurgents            against permits to export our products  in the normal course of our business with            all countries other than Germany, it is seen that these cheques are forwarded            through divers channels and collected through Hambros Bank, one of the joint            founders of Compensation Brokers (Limited).Oct. %            During discussions between our Commercial Manager  and  representatives of            the German chemical industry it was ascertained-                (a)  the allocation of goods delivered to Germany from Spain was supervised                      by Reichsbankrat Dr. Ludwig of the Reichwirtschafts-Ministerium                       Reichstelle fur Devisen-bewirtschaftung;
    (&amp;.)  the German war vessels, in Spanish waters were the channel of communica-          tion between Berlin and Burgos;    (c)  if the Pyrites Producers were not prepared to supply Germany, she would          get all the pyrites she required from the Burgos Junta with or without          the consent of the pyrites  mines;    (d)  Burgos preferred to  deal  direct with Germany.    Representatives of German chemical industry were sent by officials  of the 2nd^haK ofGerman State Supervisory Office for the Chemical  Industry by air to Seville and  c 0 er&apos;Burgos  to arrange large-scale  deliveries  of  pyrites for. Germany  through theintermediary of two ad hoe organisations, ILLS.M.A. in Seville and R.O.W.A.K.in Berlin. These organisations are closely associated with the N.S.D.A.P. party.The whole of the  share capital of R.O.W.A.K. is held by the Deutsche Revisionsund Treuhand Gesellschaft, a corporation controlled by the Government  of theGerman Reich.    This  visit was followed by the Burgos Junta  requisitioning 200,000 tons ofpyrites, of which Rio Tinto to supply 100,000 tons,  for delivery  to  Germanythrough H.I.S.M.A.   Loading orders to the  mines were issued by the GermanConsul in Huelva, Herr Clauss.    Further requisition of 170,000 tons of pyrites, of which Rio Tinto to supply Jan. l, 1937.90,000  tons,  to  Germany,  also  through  FI.I.S.M.A.  and  German  Consul,Herr Clauss.    Outline of plan for  deliveries to Germany of stocks  of  iron-ore  and the Jan. s.outputs of iron-ore mines, as and when occupied by the Insurgents, revealed byreliable German informant.  This was subsequently confirmed in Berlin by otherwell-informed sources on the  llth-12th January.    R.O.W.A.K.  informs Pyrites Producers that Germany requires 100,000 tons Jan. n.pyrites  monthly, of which Rio Tinto is to supply  50,000 tons monthly, with thehighest possible copper content.                                                  i,    R.O.W.A.K.  declares Germany prefers to secure its requirements in Spanishpyrites  by means of voluntary agreements with the Pyrites Producers, holdings    tout the inducement of Germany effectively using her influence with the Insurgentsto obtain  release  of  a  percentage  of the Sterling which the British companies have to surrender to the Insurgents, in order to obtain permits to export to allcountries.    Military Governor at Hueiva  issues letter to Pyrites  Producers pointing Jan. 22.out the desirability of not delaying the loading of the  German steamers, whichshould not be subjected  to the normal turn, but given such preference  as  will &apos;y&apos;. &apos;;  &apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;permit their most rapid despatch.    This  flagrant  case  of flag  discrimination  and   breach  of international        ,?&apos;mercantile usage was  subsequently referred to Nicolas Franco in  Salamanca.He gave it  as his decision that  all cargoes requisitioned  by the  Government,i.e., Burgos  Junta, must have priority.   v, (So far  we have ignored  this order.)   o Salamanca orders Burgos Junta to  prohibit  exports of pyrites to France. Feb. i.This has been effected,  not by Decree,  but by the simple refusal to grant permitsto load  vessels destined for consumers in  France.

In  reply to your letter of  the  15th instant,  it is true that I  have been in communication with various  possible consumers of the  ore;  it is,  however, notcorrect to assume that I have been offering supplies of this ore.
    The object of my enquiries has been to ascertain what quantities of Mesa ore &amp; (\-could be absorbed in this country in the event of supplies being available otherthan through the ordinary channels.   -     . .    I regret I am not in a position at the moment to disclose to you the circum-stances which prompted me to make these enquiries.                                               Yours faithfully,                                       (Signed)      BEN WALMSLEY.                                  .  (4)    Nay lor Benzon and Co. (Limited) to LI err Hans T. Goettig, DusseldOrf.                                              20 Abchurch Lane, London,Dear  Sir,                                         February 12, 1937.    Bio  Tinto Mesa  iron ore.    We  beg to refer  to our  recent conversations,  when you told  us  that herr  Thomasik had  informed you that the V.S. had been offered the above oreby an unknown gentleman.    We  have since heard from another source that a certain gentleman named&apos;&apos; Fuchs  Medem &apos;&apos; may have been connected with this proposal, and possibly youwill be  able  to  make discreet  enquiries  to find out, when  you next  seeHerr  Thomasik, whether there is  any  truth in this assertion.                            Yours faithfully,                                  (For Naylor Benzon and Co. (Limited) ),                               (Signed)       ALICK  R. HAY.                                    (5)     Translation of a Letter from Herr Hans T. Goettig to Messrs Naylor                         Benzon and Co. (Limited).Dear Sirs,                                    Dusseldorf, February 13, 1937.    Rio Tinto Mesa ore.     I duly received your favour of yesterday and would inform you that the nameof a Herr  Fuchs Medem is not known here.  On the other hand, I have heard from  Herr  Thomasik, who is alleged to be able to supply the Mesa ore, the casebeins&apos;as follows :     The Gesellschaft fuer Teerverwertung at Essen, a firm belonging to the V.S.,which does business in tar products for Spain,  has informed Herr Thomasik thata Herr Klaebisch of Burgos had  informed them, the  Gesellschaft fuer Teerver-wertung, that he was able to ship Mesa ore in exchange for  tar products.   Hehad  accordingly discussed  the matter with the  &quot;Director of the Rio TintoCompany.&quot; He expressly says that he can only supply iron-ore, not pyrites, since this  is disposed of elsewhere.    It is assumed here that by the  Director of the Rio Tinto Company a personageis  referred to who  has been appointed at the Rio  Tinto Mines by the FrancoGovernment as organ of the control.                                              Yours faithfully,                                     (Signed)      HANS  T. GOETTIG.
