THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1937SECRET.CP. 76 (37).CABINET.CIVIL  AVIATION.                  PROPOSED SOUTH ATLANTIC AIR SERVICE.                Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.     THE proposal to inaugurate a British, air service to South America aroseprimarily from the situation created by the Trench and Germans, who since 1928and 1932 respectively have been devoting intensive  efforts to the development ofair services across the South Atlantic.   These efforts have resulted in France andGermany, together with the United States (who have approached from the Northand encircled South America by east and west coast routes), firmly establishingthemselves in the air of the South American continent.  The charges made by theFrench and German Post Offices for the carriage of air mails  are high and  are necessarily reflected in the United Kingdom air postage  rates (e.g., 4s. per ^ oz.to the Argentine).  The postage  rates have given rise to complaint by the Britishuser : even so a deficit of about  20,000 per annum between collections and pay-ments is being carried by the Post Office.     It was accordingly decided to invite proposals for  a  British air service to south America, and an announcement  to this  effect was made  in the House ofCommons on the 19th May, 1936.     Five companies originally submitted proposals, but as all  these  failed tosatisfy certain essential conditions, the  International Air Communications Com-mittee, by whom this project was being considered, redefined the requirements and invited the tenderers to revise their schemes so far as might be necessary.  Thefinal  proposals were submitted by  British Airlines (Syndicate), Ltd., WalfordLines. Ltd., and British Airways, Ltd., but after a careful and exhaustive con-sideration of all these schemes the Committee has recommended  that  all  thetenders submitted  should be rejected. This recommendation is based on the factthat the order  of  expenditure involved by all  the  tenders is higher than it isconsidered should be necessary on the service, and that two of the three companies concerned do not  appear to possess the  necessary experience  to embark with reasonable possibility of success on a project of  this magnitude.     The Committee recommend, however, that the project  should be pursued in stages, commencing with the establishment of a regular air service via Lisbon toGambia, thus serving the West African  Colonies, from which, at a later stage, itshould prove feasible to extend a service across the South Atlantic to Brazil andthe Argentine.     For this purpose  they  recommend  that  British Airways,   Ltd., should be selected as the chosen instrument of the  Government, as being best fitted by theiroperational experience and financial backing to undertake the work.  Apart fromthe desirability of having a second string, it is clear that Imperial Airways willhave  their  hands  more than full with the development of the other  Empireservices.       [14727]                                                      B-236Copy No.  44
     The Committee recommend that the Company selected should be required tocarry  out agreed experiments during  a preliminary period, payments for these being  on a cost basis with suitable safeguards, on the understanding that, subject to  the satisfactory completion of the experimental programme, they would  be invited to tender for a permanent service on the basis of the ascertained costs of operation during  the experimental period, and  with the knowledge gained  of probable revenue.   This course would eliminate to a great extent the presentuncertain basis of tender.     A copy of the report of the Committee is appended.   This has been reviewedwith the purpose of its being made available for publication if necessary.     The financial  considerations  governing the conclusions of  the  Committee;are related to the  general provision made  by Parliament last year in the Air Navigation Act for an over-riding maximum of  1,500,000 subsidy per annum for the development of civil aviation.   This was an increase  of  500,000 over the figure laid down in the Air Transport (Subsidy Agreements) Act of 1930, and the Committee has  assumed, in considering the various fields of possible clevelop-ment,  that its task has been to select the most profitable directions for the subsidyassistance  to  be applied up to  the limit indicated by  Parliament.   It may  bewell to state in broad outline the distribution of the main subsidy expenditurenow envisaged.     (1) The Empire  Air Mail Scheme, connecting South  Africa, the Rhodesias,           the East African Colonies,  the Sudan, Egypt,  Palestine, Iraq, India,           Ceylon,  Burma,  Malaya, Australia and Hong Kong  by  air to the           United Kingdom, will absorb about  800,000 per annum,     (2) the North  Atlantic  crossing  to  the  Irish Eree  State,  Newfoundland,           Canada and the United States, together with the Bermuda-New York           connection will take up to, say,  300,000 per annum,     (3) the Trans-Tasman connection to New Zealand will involve a contribution           up to  50,000 per annum,leaving a margin of,  say,  350,000 per annum available for other developments.     The accompanying map shows that the above schemes will result in a british air network uniting all the main portions of the Empire with the exception of theWest Indies and the West African Colonies for a total gross  subsidy figure  ofabout   1,150,000 per annum.  (This figure will  be reduced by contributions  ofabout  200,000 per annum from other Governments, but the contributions cannotbe offset against the statutory maximum of  1,500,000.)     Of the remaining margin of  350,000 per annum, about  100,000 per annummay be needed  for developments in the Pacific and for the  continuation-  ofEuropean services, some of which are not yet approaching the stage of paying for themselves, leaving about  250,000 per annum available within the statutory limit of one  and a half million pounds for other projects.     The two  principal British  spheres omitted from present plans are  WestAfrica and  the West Indies.  The West Indies present particular difficulties  of approach as the Atlantic has first  to be spanned.   It seems clear, therefore, thattaking into account the comparative importance  of the West African Colonies,the most useful further link to achieve would be to Nigeria, the Gold Coast, sierra leone  and Gambia.     It has hitherto been contemplated, and indeed formed a part of the originalplan submitted  to  the  Cabinet  for  the Empire Air Mail Scheme, that  these colonies should be reached through Egypt and Khartum by a branch line acrossTrench territory to Nigeria, and a light service is now working  this route.  this route, however, is likely to prove more expensive than originally expected and,  ifused for the conveyance of all first-class mail to the West African Colonies, wouldprobably cost about  120,000 per annum in  subsidies with further  additional expenditure on ground organisation.     The alternative of  an air route travelling through Portugal and down theWest  Coast of Africa would have the advantage of  developing a shorter, andtherefore more rapid, line, while preparing the way for possible future extensions to South America.   It should also provide some protection against various schemes,mainly of foreign origin, which plan to exploit  the West Coast route to SouthAfrica.  Mr: Pirow has sought to enlist bur support in frustrating these  schemes,
and has spoken of running an air line himself from South Africa up the WestCoast as far as Nigeria.     I think it is clear that we should endeavour to develop  this route, and thatthe proposals made by the Committee  to proceed by stages, first establishing a service  to the West African colonies by  way of the West Coast, provide a suitablemethod of doing so.;&quot; &apos;   So far as finance is concerned, it  is unlikely that a West  African servicecould be started in 1937, but a survey would be put&apos;in hand and other preparationsmade, for  which the provision of, say,   50,000 can be found within the present-Estimates.  In the following year, on the best estimates of cost  and operationalprospects that can, at present] be made, a service to the West Coast Colonies onaVdhce (or  possibly twice) weekly basis should be capable of being operated for anet subsidy of about  200,000 per annum.     The organisation of ground equipment  and meteorological and other serviceswbuld  involve a capital  expenditure  of,   say,   120,000,  with a  continuingmaintenance cost of about   30,000 per annum.  \  As and when a regular air service  to the West Coast is established, the PostOffice &quot;would, I understand,  be ready to use it for the conveyance of first  classmails ;(on the same lines as  in the Empire  Air Scheme),  if  suitable terms  wereobtainable, and there is reason  to  think that the  West  African governments would follow suit.     When this service has been  thoroughly established, further experience willhave been gained with long distance ocean flying across the North Atlantic.  Withthe advanced  technique  and aircraft then available, experimental flights mightbe made across the South Atlantic, and it should  prove  feasible to combine a south American service with  the West African service within  the  overridingfinancial limits indicated earlier  in this paper.     It  may be mentioned  that  proposals  have been advanced by a BritishSyndicate  to operate a Zeppelin service from Britain to South America.  under present policy no question of a subsidy to a &quot; lighter-than-air &quot; service arises, butassuming a regular service of this kind became available at an earlier date thanthe projected  &quot; heavier-than-air  &quot; service to South  America, there  would be noapparent reason why the Post Office should  not use it  for the conveyance ofair mails provided suitable terms could be arranged.     It  will be seen that the recommendations of the Committee could only be effective if British Airways  are willing to undertake the operations assigned tothem, and  to accept the general conditions laid down by the  Committee.  It wastherefore impossible to  ask the  Cabinet to take a decision, or to  make  any announcement, without knowing what the attitude of British Airways would be.I accordingly proposed  to the Ministers represented on the  Committee that Ishould  see Mr.  Pearson, the Chairman of  British Airways,  and inform  him,confidentially, of  the  contents of the  Report.  I  did  this,  and Mr. Pearsonsubsequently informed me that the proposals would be acceptable to his company.     I explained  to Mr. Pearson that  the  selection of British Airways by theCommittee  was  based  on  the  combined  factors  of the company&apos;s practical experience and  their financial  position,  and that I must  therefore have  areasonable assurance that  their air activities, particularly on the Scandinavianroute, would not be materially curtailed.  Mr. Pearson assured  me that it was&apos;the desire  of the company to maintain their services generally  and to broadentheir basis, and that this was one of the attractions of the plan I proposed.  Atthe same time he stated very frankly the extent of the losses which the company had made,  and said that their Continental position would be difficult unless theycould have an arrangement  to carry the German mail to Cologne or Hanover,which would fit in  well with their existing  services and give them,  additional revenue.  The earlier  intention was that  Imperial Airways  should  carry thismail, but as they state that they cannot make the necessary arrangements before1938, I  think it is clear that  we should adopt the alternative  of adding this  mailto the Scandinavian mail already carried to Hanover by British Airways.  I am advised that this  should be a practical proposition, and I think we may thereforeassume  that if British Airways  are selected for the present  project they will maintain a satisfactory volume of services elsewhere. I should add that british airways and  British  Continental Airways are now amalgamated a sensiblearrangement which has  eliminated competition on the  Scandinavian  route and made partners two firms which were competitors for the South Atlantic.

     I submit accordingly for the consideration of my colleagues that it might be announced                                                                . 1     (1) that after careful investigation the Government felt unable to accept any           of the proposals  submitted for  the South American air service, and           that it has been decided to proceed by stages, instituting in the first           instance  a  service to the West African colonies by  way of the West           Coast;  1     (2) that on  the grounds indicated  in  the report  of the International Air           Communications  Committee,  and subject to satisfactory terms being           agreed, it has selected British Airways, Ltd., to operate that  service           and to act as the chosen instrument of the Government for the develop-           ment  of any future subsidised South  American  service.         ; \ ,     At the same time it would be made clear to British Airways, Ltd.,  that theirselection for this purpose would not give them any presumptive right to  a contract for a service to South America, but that their selection as chosen  instrument forthis purpose was subject to the decision of the Government to proceed with asubsidised South American service at  a future date and to  agreement then beingarrived at on satisfactory terms.                                                                       , S. ..

     British Air Lines (Syndicate) Limited,     British Continental Airwaya Limited,     Mavi&amp;;e Airways him 11ed     Walford Lines Limited;     Whitehall-&apos;Harmswdrth&quot;EjPlanger South -America Syndicate;     4a   Our study of their schemes revealed, however, that each one failed to satisfy certain conditions which we regarded as essential in a service to he operated withGovernmental support..   In order, therefore,, to affordequality of consideration to the projects of all theapplloante *  we decided to re-define the requirements ana to invite the tenderers to revise their- schemes in so far asthat might he necessary.   Letters were accordingly issued, in.this sens?1 on 2 5th June,, 1938.* Intimating that proposalsmeeting the conditions would he considered, provided, thatthey were received in the AXr Ministry by 31st July:, 1936*The requirements.^, as stated,, were as follows:. -     (a)  The  airframes and engines to be employed mustbe of British manufacture throughoutPreference would begl^en to  airframes and engines of British design andmanufa cture c     S&amp;lll&apos;  The requirement in regard to British manufacture     would not be satisfied by any arrangement whereby     component parts were imported from abroad for     incorporation into the airframee or engines in Great     Britain or Northern Ireland.

A meeting with representatives of the Company was accordingly  held by Sir Francis Shelmerdine at the Air Ministry on 3,5th July to discuss these points-. Certain information given to the Company at this meeting was also by letter dated  16th July  Imparted to the other parties,      6,-.

At an early stage in our discussion of theseproposals we reached the conclusion that the four servicesinvolving the use of &quot;Shdrt&quot; flying boats? (namely (a), (e):.(g) and (h)) involved subsidies of an order which could not be entertained^ having  regard to the limitation imposed by theAir Navigation Act,   i936f and the commitments for other airservicesi    We.: therefore, decided to confine our furtherconsideration to the remaining schemes*  namely (b)( (c)f  and(a),,  the subsidies for which fell more within practical limitsana (f)... the subsidy for which appeared capable of considerable reduction,     8,  &apos; In the course of our examination we found itnecessary to ask the Air Ministry and the General Post Officeto clear up,  an discussion with the respective tenderers?certain technical points in each of the schemes::    Meetings .under  the chairmanship of Mr*  CoJ,  Galpin^  a Deputy Director
of Civil  Aviation, were accordingly held on 13th and 13thNovember.-.   Cur Chairman,  Sir  warren Fisher? with represen-tatives of  the Committee,  also interviewed the principals  ofeach  of the tendering companies at the Treasury on Friday,15th  January., 1937,, in order to obtain further information on certain of  the broader aspects of their proposals*      9,   We have now concluded our- e xanination of theschemes submitted and desire to offer the following remarksarid recommendations with regard to theuu          This scheme envisages the use of &quot;Sikorsky&quot; flying boats of.  British construction.   The promoters have represented that, were they allowed to instal in the aircraft compression ignition engine  of German construction* the&quot;Jumo&quot; IV (750 hup;K It would be possible to operate theservice without subsidy;.    II:    Apart from the fact  that the engine in question would not fulfil the stipulated requirement of Britishmanufacture-, we are advised by the Air Ministry TechnicalDepartment that this particular type of engine has not yet reached the stage of development at which it could he reli ;dupon for  a regular service across the South atlantic  and  $hatits employment at present would be in the nature of an experiment,.    (The compression  ignition engine actually us?din German aircraft for transatlantic flights is of smallertype (the &quot;Jurao&quot; &quot;V of 550 h4p,))s    Me have therefore  been unable to entertain this particular suggestion^  and ourremarks relate to  the scheme  based upon the use of Bristol&quot;Pegasus&quot;  engines  of British  construction.
    12*   Th&amp; capital costs are put at  1,700*000t of which under-writing; cost of issue  and percentage to the Syndicatewould absorb  185,000.   The promoters informed us that theyhave had discussions with a financial house, hut had not? asyetobtained anything in the nature of a financial backingfor the scheme.   This would apparently only be forthcoming.if the Air Ministry endorsed it- and undertook to provide thenecessary subsidy*   To this extent acceptance of the scheme would involve on the part of the Government moral responsibility to the subscribers.;                          -    13*   The promoters claim9 but the Air Ministry are not convinced^ that the performance of the aircraft would be adequate to allow of the pay-loads on which the estimates are based being carried across the ocean stage with an adequatemargin, of safety against a SO m.p.h. headwinds    14c   But this apart-, we are advised that the estimates .of. revenue are quite unattainablea even when adjusted to take account of an initial, error in computation. ;  It appears to be out of the question to- expect, as the scheme assumes-,. that-revenue of nearly  1*000 would, accrue for the carriage of mailon each home-coming flights    The figure as revised by theCompany, of subsidy for the service was-;  250,000* -to whichmust be added  136,000 to counter-balance the over-estimate in revenue bringing the sum up to  386,000*    Even then we are advised that it is unduly &quot;optimistic on the part of theCompany to assumes as they do? that an average of aizpassengers and one ton - of freight would be carried all theway on each flight in addition to mails,&apos;    15.,    As regards the aircraft to be employed, our-attention had baen called to the s statement  of the Chairman ofBritish Marine Aircraft Limited (which Company holds the
exclusive manufacturing rights in  this country of the Se4-2&quot;Sikorsky&quot; flying boat).,  that- they had decided to suspend forthe time being the policy of building flying boats*   Weenquired.; therefore$ of the promoters whether they would, beable to secure deliveries of this  type of aircraft;   Theyasserted that there would not be difficulties in thisrespect, and that they contemplated establishing a factoryto construct aircraft themselves^   In spite of this statementwe are not satisfied that,, in fact- the aircraft would be forthcoming in reasonable time?    16*   To sura up the position as it appears to us -withregard to these proposals?     (i)  There is as yet no financial backing for the scheme,    (it)  A subsidy in the neighbourhood of  400,000 would berequired.::   (iii)  It is far from established, that the performance ofthe air-craft would be adequate.,    (iv)  There .1sf  in any casey  no assurance that deliveries of the aircraft could be obtained in reasonable times     iv)  We have no evidence that the promoters possess thenecessary experience of major air operations to be entrusted with ixn air service  of this magnitudes    Is?*   These considerations make it impossible for us torecommend that  the proposals should be accepted.    18,   The subsidy proposed at first by the Company was 147*000 per annum for the- weekly service and  128,000 perannum for the twice-weekly one3 but following upon themeeting at the Air Ministry when it was suggested to them
 that  the estimates of mail earnings  were much  inflated? they adjusted these figures to  170 5-000* sect  2153.,000*&quot;?.-respectively *    19-.   The capital cost- of each of these services  is estimated as  360*000,   To provide  the necessary capital expenditure and working capital for-  the whole  scheme, land plane servicesg followed by flying boat, services., the Company considered that it would be  necessary  to make an issue of  1,000,000.,   The authorised capital  of the Company (which is a  shipping company) is  1*301 .-648 of whichy however::  only  49,643 has been is sued *   In this case also the finance of the project could only be found if the proposals were vouched for to the extent of official  support.&apos; and subsidy-.    SO.-   The Company have been at considerable pains and some expense to investigate the ground organization cf the route* They are,, however * without experience of air operations themselvesj but appear to assume that this can be purchased in the open markets    21o   They have based their estimates on the use  of themonospar landplane &quot;Groydon&quot;.  explaining that  this is the only suitable aircraft which they were able to  select in the short time available for the submission of their revised tendero    22.,   In order to meet the objections of the Air Ministry that no surplus margin of fuel has been allowed In theproposals over and above what necessary to make the ocean.crossing against a 35 jnipliu  head wind,,  the Company havesuggested that Ascension Island should be used so as  toreduce the length of the ocean crossing?    We  are advised s note;- .  In a letter dated 18th  January..  1957, the  Oomuanv           na!v  stated  that these figures  were&apos; only rough           estimates, and have altered them to  145,000  and            180 s000 re spec tively0

Even assuming that Ascension Island could be used.,we understand that the &quot;croydon&quot; aircraft In its present stage of development could not carry enough fuel for thelong  sea crossing as well as the pay loads envisaged in thisschemeo    24*   The Company disarmed this criticism by offering to adapt their scheme to operation with any more suitableaircraft which the Air Ministry night suggests   In fact?they  appeared to be ready to reconsider all their figures*technical and financial in the light of official criticises          While appreciating this spirit of accommodation we feel  it necessary to point out that our task is to compare trelative merits of tenders based on the requirements weindicated^ and not to put forward proposals of our own.    25*   The sTibsidy proposals as advanced by the Company?which examination of the operating costs suggests might hesusceptible of some reductions compare, prima faciegfavourably with those of the other applicants8 but the factthat  the aircraft is unsuitable vitiates a comparison andr-tiles out the possibility of accepting the proposals^          Added to this is the fact thats although the promoters have experience of shipping operationSj, they wouldin this scheme for a major air service, be embarking upon a form of transport entirely novel to them.-.    26 0   \7e cannot recommend., therefore9 that Walford LinesLtdcj should be selected to inaugurate this service0
    87 3   The Company explained that their- omission to tender for a twice-weekly? as well as for a once-weekly^ service withlandplanes was due to a mi sunderstending of the official letterof 25th june  hut they would he prepared to increase the frequency of the service to two flights per week after an experimental period, which they considered necessary in anycase,-,.   This would entail revision of their costs-.    23,-   The scheme is &quot;based upon the use of the DeH-,91aircraft which? if its estimated performance .is realised^would, we are advised* be capable of crossing the Atlanticwith, the load envisaged^    &quot;29,   The Company&quot; s p rope sale appear to have &quot;been worked out with thoroughness,;  : They include provision for a school -for the training of pilots and navigators for this service *and the Company stress,., with just if icatlon^ the necessity forthis,-, bearing in mind the present dearth of qualifiedpersonnela   They have developed to us their views with regardto the progressive establishment of the service.;   these views seem sound and give evidence of.their closeacquaintance with air operations*    oOn   The capital e.expenditure involved in this service^is  342^,755a   (For the complete scheme,, landplane service,?  sfollowed &quot;by flying boat service., it was  975? 155)*&apos;   TheCompany has a subscribed capital of  400;000.. - and the       &quot;necessary additional, funds could? -we were assured^ be foundwithout going to public issue.?    3io   In contrast with the  proposals of other applicants?their figure of estimated revenue ( 20,000) appearsextremely lowc-    From a consideration of probable mailpayments alone  we understand that this figure could safely be

This course would eliminate to a great extent the present uncertain basis of tendere    39-,   We recommend that the service itself should be developed in stages          The first stage should aim at the establishmentof regular operations between this country, Lisbon andBathursto   This should afford a valuable improvement of passenger communications with Portugal and in itselfprovide an acceleration to South America by connecting withsteamship services calling at Lisbon?  while the extension to Gambia should be capable of being linked up with alocal  service to the other Y/est African Colonies,,   By thismeans  it should be feasible to provide a better air route to the  important Yfest African colonies than is available atpresent and facilitate the development of British air communications (including mails) along the &quot;West Coast ofAfrlca*          The experience gained and the organisation createdduring  this stage should prove a sound basis for the
inauguration of flights across the South Atlantic oceanand thus pave the way to regular operations to theSouth American continent, an the second stage.,    40-..
