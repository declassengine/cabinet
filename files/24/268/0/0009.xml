THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF JUS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOiprRNMENT.1.   The Unemployment Insurance Statutory Committee have presentedtheir annual report, of which a copy is attached, upon the financialcondition of the Unemployment Fund on 51st December, 1936.   TheCommittee report that the Fund, in respect of its general account,is and is likely to continue to be more than reasonably sufficientto discharge its liabilities and that there is a non-recurrent surplusof  17,250,000 which is available for disposal.   This sum includesnot only the surplus above expectation realised in 1936 but also asubstantial part of that in prospect for 1937.   If this surplus is tobe used for a form of recurrent expenditure it has to be translated into terms of an annual surplus.   For this purpose the Committee adoptthe same principle as they applied to the surplus reported in their third report and propose to use up the new accumulated surplus over the assumed average length of a trade cycle, viz., eight years.   allowing for interest this gives an annual surplus of about  2,250,000 a year.2.   By a majority of 5 to 2 - the Chairman, Sir W. Beveridge, beingamong the majority - the Statutory Committee recommend for the reasonsdescribed in gjjsj 44 to 56 of their Report that this surplus should beused to extend the period for which unemployment &quot;benefit is payableboth at the beginning of unemployment and also - in the case ofcontributors whose recent industrial record is good - at the end ofthe period for which benefit is now payable.   The Committee recommendfirst that the &quot;waiting time&quot; of six days for which no benefit is payable at the beginning of a period of unemployment should be reducedto three days and, second^ that a more generous rule than the existingCopy No.CABINET.UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE STATUTORY COMMITTEE.ANNUAL REPORT UPON THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE    UNEMPLOYMENT FUND AT 31ST DECEMBER, 1936.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR.
rule should be adopted in the calculation of the number of additionaldays of benefit - in excess of the standard allowance of 156 days ina benefit year - which are allowed to contributors who have had little unemployment during the last five years.    At present acontributor is allowed three additional days of benefit for everyfive contributions paid during the past five years less one day forevery five days of benefit drawn during that period.   The changerecommended by the Committee is that &quot;the provision of &quot;additional&quot;days should be made more ample by subtracting one &quot;additional&quot; day forevery eight days, in place of every five days, of benefit already drawn5.   The Committee recommend that the change in the waiting period should operate from 1st April, 1937 and that the &quot;additional days&quot;should be applicable to persons whose benefit years commenced on andafter 1st January, 1937;  the Committee estimate that these changes will increase the annual expenditure of the Fund by an average amountof approximately  2,250,000 a year - or  17,250,000 in the eight year period (1937-1944-).   The Committee summarise their reasons (gj 34) foranticipating that unemployment over a period of years after 1944 willbe at such a level as to enable the income of the Fund then to carry the changes now recommended.4.   There is a dissenting recommendation by Sir Amos Ayre andCapt. C.C. Craig to the effect that the surplus of  17,250,000 shouldbe applied to reduce the present rates of contributions or, if thatis not done, to the repayment of the debt of the Unemployment Fund inaccordance with the proviso to Section 60(2) of the UnemploymentInsurance Act, 1935.   The Committee draw attention in I 45 to thefact that the amount of the surplus is not sufficient to permit ofan all round reduction of contributions comparable with that madein July last, when there was a reduction of Id.  in the contributions in respect of all workpeople of 18 years of age and over.   The
cost of that reduction was approximately  6,500,000 annually.    The amountof the surplus now available is not even sufficient to cover a general reduction of -g-d.   In SS 39 and 4-0 of their Report the majority of theCommittee give cogent reasons for their decision not to recommend the use of.the surplus for the repayment of debt.   It will &quot;be recalled that such acourse can be adopted only upon the recommendation of a majority of theCommittee.5.   I think that we should adopt the recommendations of the majority of theCommittee.   The reduction in the &quot;waiting-time&quot; will be popular;  it hasbeen urged upon me from many sides.   Moreover,  with the occurrence of theSecond Appointed Day for Unemployment Assistance on 1st April  men entitled to unemployment benefit will be permitted to apply to the unemployment assistance Board for supplementation of their benefit payments.   It isdesirable to minimise the number of cases in which such men will be able toshow that they are in need of an allowance during the period of waiting before they receive the first payment of benefit.6.   The Statutory Committee have reported formally (gg 61 - 64) upon thefinancial condition of the agricultural account of the Unemployment Fund.In view of the fact that benefit under the agricultural scheme was not payable in respect of days before 5th November last they say that it is clearlyimpossible for them to express any opinion on the financial solvency orotherwise of the scheme.   Thus the agricultural scheme will continueunaltered and will still embody a &quot;waiting-time&quot; of six days.    This is unavoidable as the agricultural scheme has its own finance and in any case itdiffers from the general scheme in a number of particulars.7. Subject to the Chancellors concurrence I propose to adopt the recommendationmade by the majority of the Committee, and to take the necessary action forgiving effect to it by affirmative Resolution of both Houses.(intld.)

UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE STATUTORY COMMITTEE Fourth  Report on the Financial Condition of  the     Unemployment Fund  (General Account),             as at 31st December, 1936 To the Rt. Hon. ERNEST BROWN,  M.C., M.P.,             Minister  of Labour. SIR,   By section 59 (1) of  the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1935,. we are required to make a report on the financial condition of the Unemployment Fund at the end of each calendar year.  By section 8 (1) of the Unemployment Insurance (Agriculture) Act, 1936, we are required to exercise this function of reporting on the financial condition of the Unemployment Fund separately with regard to the General and the Agricultural Accounts of the Fund. We  submit  below, accordingly,  a  report with regard to  the General Account of the Unemployment Fund,  with a recom- mendation for the application of a surplus.  We are reporting separately with regard  to the Agricultural Account.   1. We begin  by presenting in Appendix A a formal account of the working of the  Fund in the calendar year 1936, with corresponding figures for 1935 in parallel columns for compari- son.,  The first portion  of this Appendix  deals with the General Account.  The  account  has  been  prepared  for  us  by  the Accountant General for the Ministry of  Labour.  It is not an audited account, but it is in the same  form as the accounts of the Fund which are presented to Parliament after audit, for the financial year ending on 31st March.  2. The receipts for the calendar year were  65,707,238, of which  all but  238,199 represented  insurance contributions by employers, employed persons and the State.  The other receipts included a net sum of   226,251  as income from investments,after allowing for loss on redemption of certain securities.  Theexpenditure was  48,179,768 made  up of  38,010,000 for  un-employment benefit,  4,750,000 for  administration,  5,000,000for debt service, and  419,768 for minor items.  Income during1936 exceeded expenditure accordingly by  17,527,470, making,with the balance of  21,449,810 carried forward at 31st Decem-ber, 1935, a net balance at 31st December, 1936, of  38,977,280.  3.  As compared with 1935, all the principal heads  of incomeshow an increase in 1936. The rise of  534,647 in contributions from employers and employed persons is due partly  to normalgrowth of the insured  population and  partly to the  decline ofunemployment.   The increase would have been greater but  forthe reduction in the rates of contribution which came into opera-tion on 6th July, 1936,  and is referred  to below. The increaseof  56,347 in contributions from Defence Departments in respectof men discharged from H.M. forces is mainly due to the pay-ment of additional contributions to meet the cost of the improved
 conditions under the Unemployment Insurance Act,  1934.  The increase of  305,960 in  the Exchequer contribution is  propor- tionate to the increase of contributions from the other  sources named above.  There is  an increase of  44,813 in income from investments after allowing for a loss of  106,377 on the redemp- tion of the 2 per cent. Treasury Bonds  early in the year.  The increase is due to the growth of  the  balance of the  general account of the  Unemployment Fund.  4. On the  side of expenditure, the decline of unemployment has  led to  a  reduction  in  the  expenditure on  benefit  of  6,045,000]  The rise of  250,000 in the cost of administration is due, in the main, to the operation for a full year of the in- creases of administrative expenditure referred to in paragraph 4 of our last Report;  there  has been an increase, also, in the assess- ment  of  the  cost  of superannuation.   There  is a decrease ( 20,925) in the  minor item of refund of contributions  paid in error and an increase ( 141,467)  in the  item of contributions to courses of instruction. The first  of these items- depends on the claims made by employers and employed  persons;  the second depends, as regards juveniles, on the rate of approved expendi- ture by Local Education Authorities and,  as regards adults, on the programme of training of the  Ministry of Labour.  5. The  5,000,000 for  debt service paid in.two half-yearly in- stalments of  2,500,000  each at 31st March,  and 30th Septem- ber, 1936, included  4,230,646  as  interest,  and   769,354  as repayment of capital.  The debt at the end of September, 1936, stood at  104,741,034 and interest in the  current half  year is accruing at an  average rate of 3^ per cent.  This rate will  fall, as the earlier advances at high  rates are repaid; from October, 1938, onwards the rate  of interest on  the whole  debt  will be 3^ per cent.  6. As regards investments, the policy was continued of invest- ing the growing balance of the Fund in short term securities, this policy being  governed by the conclusion  that the securities would need to be realised to meet deficiencies in the present trade cycle.   At the end of 1935 more than  17,000,000, or the greater part of the balance of the Fund, was invested in 2 per cent. Treasury  Bonds.   When these Bonds  were  redeemed  by the Government on 2nd March, 1936, the arrangements referred  to in paragraph 5 of our  report of 7th February, 1936, were  carried out,  about  7,000,000  of the redemption money  being  re-invested in the  purchase  of 2-J per cent.  Treasury  Bonds, 1937, and  about  10,000,000 in  the new  issue of 1 per cent.  Bonds 1939-41.  Weekly surpluses since that time have been invested in the 1 per cent.  Bonds and latterly in 4J per cent. ConversionStock 1940-44.  The present position in  relation to investmentsis shown at the  foot of the Statement of Account (Appendix A).The 2-ij per cent. Bonds (of.which  8,794,400 were held  for theFund on  31st  December, 1936) were  redeemed on the  1stFebruary, 1937.
Working  and  Prospects  of  Unemployment Fund  General    Account with its Present  Contributions and Benefits.  7.  We supplement the formal account of the UnemploymentFund for the calendar year 1936, by a Table in Appendix Bshowing the course of unemployment and the financial workingof.  the  general unemployment insurance  scheme,  month  bymonth from November, 1931,  to December,  1936.  The figuresof income and expenditure are statistical approximations  only,but are sufficient  as  a  general guide to the operation of  thescheme.  8. In preparing last year our Third Report on the FinancialCondition of the  Unemployment  Fund, as at 3rst  December,1935, we estimated the prospective income and expenditure ofthe Fund, in the light of a statement submitted to us by  theCommittee on Economic Information.   This statement placed the most probable mean level of unemployment for the nextcomplete trade cycle,  beginning  with  the year  r936,  at i6jor i6f per cent.  9. Adopting the higher of these  percentages as  a  workinghypothesis for the eight years 1936-43, and taking into account the accumulated reserve of the Unemployment Fund, amount-ing at 31st December, 1935, to about  21,450,000, we decidedto adjust the income and expenditure of the Fund, on the  basisof using up  in the eight years 1936-43 the  bulk of the accumu-lated reserve.  On this basis, we estimated the disposable sur-plus of the  Unemployment Fund, with the contributions and benefits then existing, as  something  under  but  approaching 6,500,000 a year.  We recommended that this surplus shouldbe disposed of by reducing the contributions of all insured work-people who  had attained the age of r8 by id. a week.  Thisrecommendation was  adopted  and  the. reduced contributionscame into force on 6th July, 1936.  10;  This estimate of the disposable surplus involved, as  wepointed  but  at the time,  making various assumptions going beyond  the  estimate of mean unemployment of  16 - 75 in theyears  1936-43,  adopted  from  the  Committee on  economic information. The two:most important additional assumptionswere.      (a)  that the mean unemployment percentage  after  1943    would not be more than 16-o, which is the balancing point    of the Fund at the new rates of contribution (Paragraph 28    of Third Report);      (6)  that the order of succession  of  relatively good and    relatively bad years  during 1936-43 would be such as  to    prevent  the Fund from being in debt at any time for more    than two years together (Paragraph 29).-  11.  The second of  these  assumptions  meant in  practicemaking a  hypothesis,  not only as to the mean unemployment
over the eight years  1936-43, but as to the  unemployment ineach individual year of that period.  In estimating our surplusand making our recommendation, we had before  us, not onlythe estimate of 16 - 75 as the mean unemployment over the years1936-43, but a table  of unemployment percentages assumedfor each of those years (averaging out to the figure of 16-75)*&apos;with assumed proportions of unemployment ranking for benefit from this we inferred the income and expenditure of the fund in each year from 1936 to 1943, if our recommendation for reduction of contributions were carried out.  12.  We are able now to compare results with expectations forthe year 1936 on which  we are reporting.   On the hypothesisoffered to us by the Committee on Economic Information, we expected during the year 1936  to be in  a &quot;relatively favourableperiod of the trade cycle.  Even with the proposed reductionof contributions, we anticipated that during  1936  and for oneor two  years thereafter  we should  make substantial gains  inthe Unemployment Fund and be able to accumulate surpluses,for meeting  losses in  the less favourable years to come.  Forthe year 1936 we assumed last February a mean unemploymentpercentage of 14-5 of which 46 per cent,  would rank for benefit.On this basis, the  contribution  income of the Fund during theyear would have exceeded its expenditure by  10,573,000  and,allowing for interest, the  accumulated &quot;balance at the end of theyear would have been  32,272,000.  13.  The actual experience of  unemployment during 1936 hasbeen materially more favourable than this expectation.  From16-i at the end of January,  1936, the unemployment percentagein Britain fell substantially  each month  till the end of August,when-it reached 11-9, remaining thereafter at the same level tothe end of the year.  The mean for the whole of 1936 was 13 - oas compared with  the expectation  of  14-5.   The percentageranking for benefit was 46-2 as compared with the expectation of 46-0,  and the  average amount of each payment of benefitwas  0-876  as compared with   0-88.   In the event, the con-tribution income  has  exceeded  expenditure by   17,301,000and, including interest,  the   accumulated   balance  at  31stDecember,  1936,  reached  38,977,280,  that  is to  say, about 6,700,000 above expectation.  14. We have  thus   an   accomplished   improvement  of 6,700,000  on expectations in  the, past year. - We have toestimate, as best we can, the prospects for the current year and perhaps thereafter.  When  it became clear  that our expecta-tions for 1936 were likely to be exceeded substantially, we feltthat it would be desirable to ascertain  the views  of the Cpm-mittee on Economic Information.  We had&apos;the great advantageat the end of November last of  discussing the situation, withMr. H. D. Henderson as  representative of that Committee, and   40912                                          &apos;&quot;&quot;  A-a-

The fall in unemployment accordingly  is general, but itis  by  no means  equal  in  different  industries.   While  theunemployed  percentage  for all industries has fallen from 14 - 4to II-9, i.e.  by 2-5, the 21 industries named  below all show adecline of more than 4-0  and together with coal-mining (with28,375 or 2-2 per cent, fewer unemployed) account for half thetotal reduction in the numbers unemployed.   The 21 industries are  mainly,, but not wholly,  such as  would  be stimulateddirectly by the defence programme.  The table shows not onlythe decline in unemployment in each of the  21 industries  butthe change  in the numbers employed,  after allowing for  thechange  in the numbers insured as  between  July, 1935,  and july,  1936.  In three  of:  the  industries cotton  weaving,musical instruments and textile bleaching unemployment  has fallen less through returning prosperity than through decline inthe  numbers  seeking  employment; in  cotton  weaving  andwe  base  our report  largely on conclusions drawn from , that discussion.    But before giving these  conclusions,  it may be convenient  to describe briefly the nature of the  fall  that hastaken place in  unemployment during the past year, and  toshow how the fall is distributed, industrially and  locally.  Wegive in Appendix C three tables analysing unemployment  inNovember, 1936, and a year before, by industries, by adminis-trative  Divisions, and.by counties.  November was the latestmonth  for which figures were available at the time when the analysis was made, and  On general grounds is a  better month for  such  comparisons than December, when the  figures  are more liable  to accidental disturbance by the Christmas seasonand the weather.    We  draw  attention  here  to  the  principal features in these tables.             Decline of  Unemployment m.1936.  15.. By- Industries. From  November,  1935, to  November,1936, there  has been a  fall of the unemployed percentage  inevery industry except eight.  The eight exceptions are

  xfj. By, Divisions. The three divisions showing the smallestproportionate decline of numbers unemployed, from November,1935,. to November, 1936; are, on the one hand, the London andSouth-Eastern Divisions (13-2 per cent, decline) which has the lowest unemployed  percentage, and  Wales (11-9 per  cent.decline) and Scotland (13:9 per cent,  decline) with the highestunemployed  percentages.   In London  and  the . South-Eastunemployment is presumably near the irreducible minimum. in wales and Scotland,  high unemployment is  chronic.  The three other Divisions or groups  of  Divisions shown in  Table 2 of appendix C,  all  have larger  proportions of decline,  ranging from 16-4 to  20-9 per cent.   In  this  table the former North-Eastern and  North-Western Divisions, which  have now beenformed  into  three Divisions,  are combined, since  change ofboundaries in July, 1936, makes individual comparison of these divisions  impossible.  18. By  Counties.&apos; The county table brings out the somewhatremarkable fact! that  the highest unemployed  percentages areto be found, not in counties forming parts of the special areas,but iri the rural counties of Scotland and Wales.  19. Of the forty English counties, two only, namely Cumber-land (26:7) and Durham  (22-7); have percentages of unemploy-ment above 20-0/ Both are special area cases and in both therehas been  a  substantial proportionate  decline of the  numbers unemployed:  in: Durham from 124,091 to  95,272  or  by 23-2 per cent.;; in Cumberland from 18,024  to I5*934 or hy  11-6 percent.-   : &apos;      \           -  20.

In Wales, where the general level  of  unemployment is higher, seven counties out of thirteen have an unemployed per-centage above 25-0 as follows:  				Proportion of	Unemployed		Percentage change-	insured	Percentage.		in numbers	unemployed			. unemployed from	with claims	Nov.

Theother counties are rural.  In substance Wales presents the samefeatures as Scotland.   The highest unemployment percentagesoccur predominantly in rural counties; it is these counties which show relatively little improvement in the past year and showalso  high proportions  of  unemployment ranking  for benefit.These latter points of contrast are epitomised in the comparison of Montgomery and Monmouth, with practically the same levelof unemployment.  22. In England also, though some rural  counties have rela-tively  low rates  of unemployment,  those counties  in eachDivision which have markedly higher unemployed percentagesthan the Division as a whole are  as a rule either predominantlyrural or largely engaged  in  mining.   This appears from thefollowing table giving the  counties with 10 per cent, of  unem-ployment or  more  in  the South-Eastern,  South-Western andMidlands Divisions.

IO  23. In  the  three. Southern Divisions those  counties where unemployment had fallen below g-o by November,  1935, showas a rule little further  improvement in the past year.  Thesecounties  are as follows: -  Unemployed Percentage.November,     November,Bedfordshire,Bucks  ...CambridgeshireHertsMiddlesex   &apos; .Surrey-SussexBerksOxford  ...WiltsHuntsLeicestershire  .NorthantsWarwickshire  .1935- 8-0 4-9 5-9 5-8 5-2 6-3 7-3 7-9 6-8 5-9 yi 7-2 7-5 6-41936. 8-3 5-i 5-5 6-1 4-5 5-8 7-7 7&apos;5 7-4 4&apos;4 2-8 6-2 6-5 4-5Increase  - or decrease.    0-3    0-2    0:4    o-3    0-7    o-5    o-4    0-4    o-6    i-5    4-3    1 - o    1 -o    1-9-fH-+4-+  The  numbers in Huntingdonshire are very small.  The only other counties in the above list where the unemployed percentagehas fallen by more than  1 - o  are Wiltshire and Warwickshire;the figures in each of these counties are dominated by industrial areas.  24. The local analysis suggests, on the one hand, a tendency for the fall of unemployment through industrial  recovery tobecome arrested even  in the most  prosperous  counties  at aminimum of five, six or even seven per cent., and,  on the otherhand,  a tendency in many rural areas both for unemploymentas a whole to remain at a high level and for a relatively largeproportion of this unemployment to  rank for benefit. &apos; Theseare matters appearing to call for investigation, with a view to determining how far the tendencies shown arise from industrialcauses and how far, if at all, they arise through the operation ofthe insurance scheme itself.  Whatever their cause, they affectsubstantially the financial condition of the Unemployment fund and appear to set limits  to the hope of further improvement.In  contrast  to the  rural areas shown  above,  the depressedmining and industrial counties have for the most part  a rela-tively  small part of their total unemployment on benefit;  as a consequence  they affect less directly the finance of the  Unem-ployment Fund.   The actual  numbers both of insured persons and of persons unemployed in the rural counties are fortunatelysmall,  in comparison with those of industrial areas. More than half the unemployment of Scotland is found in Lanarkshire andMidlothian; more than three quarters of the total unemploymentof Wales is in Glamorgan and Monmouthshire.  25. The industrial analysis, as we have said, shows a fall ofunemployment during the past twelve months in nearly every
                             I-industry.  The defence programme - has come ,in  to: re-inforcethe later stages of a general recovery.  How much  of the recentdecline of unemployment is due to this special factor and how much to general recovery, it is hard to say.;  But it seems im-probable that the defence programme, in view  of  its  recentadoption, can yet have exercised more than a part of its ultimatetotal effect.    If that is  so, the defence programme may beexpected to sustain employment for some time to come.  26. This inference  is in accord with the results of Our dis-cussion  with Mr. Henderson.   The conclusions suggested byMr.  Henderson as a  guide to our action  were:        (a)  That, in view of  the defence  programme, there is     practically no prospect of an appreciable recession of em-     ployment from the present level, for 1937 and for some time     thereafter.      (&amp;) That on  the completion of the intensive phase of the     defence programme and in the normal course of the trade     cycle,  we  should be prepared for a  relatively severe re-     cession, but that nothing has happened to justify an assump-     tion that the levels of unemployment then reached will be     either  materially  higher  or materially lower . than . those     assumed in the original estimate of 164 to 165 per cent.  27. It is needless to  emphasise the  uncertainties attached toany expression of opinion on such matters as are  dealt with inthe second of those paragraphs.   We draw conclusions as tothe course of unemployment in the future, only because without some conclusions, of whatever character, we  cannot performour  statutory duty  of reporting on the prospective relation  be-tween the income and the  expenditure of the UnemploymentFund and adjusting its finances.   We only prophesy  because we must.   The practical result of tire conclusions set  out in thelast paragraph is that  we keep to the estimates  made in  ourThird Report as the ground-plan of our financial  policy, while taking account  of  those improvements on expectation whichhave been realised already in 1936,  or are practically certain to be realised in 1937.  28. Events have  improved upon our expectations in the  past year to  the extent of  6,700,000.  The circumstances appear tocall for a revision of our original expectations for the  coming year.  For 1937, at the time of our Third Report, we assumedan unemployment percentage of 15-0 with 46-5 per cent, rank-ing  for benefit; on this we  should have  expected to make  afurther  gain of  5,325,000.   For the reasons already  given thisexpectation  is now practically certain to  be  exceeded.    Theunemployment percentage for the last five months of 1936  hasbeen 11-9.   In the light of Mr. Henderson&apos;s statement to us,we assume now that unemployment in the coming year will be    40912                                              A 5
12not appreciably greater than  this,  say 12 per cent.   At this rate of unemployment, the proportion ranking for benefit shouldbe a little lower than the 46-2 experienced on 13 per cent, ofunemployment in  1936;  we assume a proportion of 45-0 percent, and that the mean cost of each  payment will be  0-88.On these assumptions, the income of the Fund during 1937 will exceed  the  expenditure,  *iot by  5,325,000,  but by  about 17,600,000, that is  to  say,  there will  be a  surplus  aboveexpectation of  12,275,000.  29. A surplus of this size in  1937 is not certain, as the surplusof  6,700,000 already realised in 1936 is  certain.   But on theviews submitted to us by Mr. H. D. Henderson,  on behalf ofthe Committee on Economic Information, it is nearly certain.We believe that we can allow sufficiently  for the small element of uncertainty, by  treating as realised, not the whole of the prospective net surplus in 1937, but 80 per cent,  of it.   this gives,  as  the surplus above  expectation which we  can nowbring into account from 1937, 80 per cent, of  12,275,000 or 9,820,000.   Adding  this figure  to the  6,700,000 realised in1936, we  reach, as the disposable surplus, a  sum  of  about 16,500,000.  Keeping our original estimates of unemploymentin 1936-43 as ground plan, it is as if we had started with anaccumulated reserve,  not of  21,450,000 but  of   37,950,000.That is the effect of  the  lower  unemployment  experienced in1936 and in prospect for 1937.                -Determination  of a Surplus.  30. The sum of  16,500,000 named  above is a non-recurrentsurplus.  The only substantial form of non-recurrent expendi-ture  open to us is that of paying off the debt of the Unemploy-ment Fund more rapidly than by  the statutory sinking fund.We discussed  this point in our Third Report and  gave reasons which led us then not to use  any part of our surplus in  addi-tional payment of debt, under  the existing provisions of theUnemployment Insurance Act.   We shall  return later in thisReport to this question of paying off debt, with suggestions for amending the law.  Under the law as  it stands, we feel boundto dispose of the present surplus also, not on the non-recurrentpurpose of paying off debt but by adding to annual expenditureor reducing annual income.  31. The non-recurrent surplus of  16,500,000 must be trans-la ted into an  annual  surplus.  The question arises at once asto the number of years  over which it shall be spread.    Thenumber of  years  must be  substantial, but should not be so great as to  turn disposal of the surplus into investment.   Inour Third Report we adopted, as the Committee on economic information had adopted, a period of eight years as the most
 probable mean length of a trade cycle and we adjusted the in- come and expenditure of the Fund with a view to using up, in the eight years 1936-43,  the accumulated  reserve in hand at the beginning of that period. We propose to adopt a  similar period in disposing of the additional surplus now declared,  that is to say we treat it as a sum for expenditure in the eight years 1937-44.. If expenditure of  the surplus  is spread in this way over a period of years, interest will  accrue on it, and on a con- servative estimate should amount  over the eight years to about  750,000.   This brings  the  sum  that we have for additional expenditure in those  years to a  total of  17,250,000.   More- over, since any change of contributions or benefit proposed by us cannot apply to the first  months of 1937, the net period of additional expenditure or decreased income is  less than eight years. .  The  exact length of this net period  depends  on the measures adopted for disposing of the surplus and  the date at which they  became effective.   With the measures proposed by us below, the net period is just over 7J years and corresponds to expenditure in  that period at the rate of about   2,250,000 a year.  We report,  accordingly, that, with the  existing con- tributions and benefits, the General Account of the  Unemploy- ment Fund  is and is likely to continue to be more than reason- ably sufficient to discharge its liabilities, and  we put the  dis- posable  surplus in  round figures at   16,500,000  as  a  non- recurrent sum or for purposes of  recurrent expenditure in the period 1937-44 at a total of  17,250,000 or a rate of  2,250,000 a year.  In making this  finding,  we have  to call attention to three  principal assumptions involved in it.  32. First, we  are assuming that,  in spite of the  specialised character of industrial development  under the defence  pro- gramme to-day, any recession following the end of the intensivephase of the programme will involve  not more unemployment than is allowed for in the original estimate of the Committee on Economic Information. In the light of demobilisation experience after the last war, this is an optimistic assumption, justified, we hope, by the fact that we have adopted  the higher  of the two figures suggested to us by that Committee, that is to say i6f per cent., rather than 16^ per cent.          ;  33. Second, we are taking into account now, not only  the surplus above expectation already realised in 1936 but that in prospect  for 1937,  treating the estimated gain of  1937 as a certainty up to 80 per cent.  The events of 1937 cannot, in the nature of the case,  be a certainty  on 31st December, 1936, up to 80  per cent, or any other fraction; it is  not impossible for the actual gains of 1937 to prove less  than 80 per cent,  of the esti- mate, so that  the surplus which we  treat  as realised already is never realised at all.  As against this possibility, we set,  not only our general power of dealing with deficiencies as well as   40912                                               A 6
with surpluses, but also the probability that gains above expecta-tions will be realised even after 1937.  On the views submittedto us by Mr. Henderson, the defence programme should sustainemployment, not only throughout 1937, but for a substantialtime thereafter.  Even if, through an unexpectedly early decline of employment in other directions, we fail to realise in  1937 allthe gains now taken  into. account,  we may expect in  1938 tomake a further gain above the expectations of our Third Report,sufficient to make good any deficiency of 1937..  34. Third, in proposing to increase expenditure or decreaseincome by about  2,250,000  a  year we make  the balancingpoint of the Fund a mean  unemployment percentage of 15-4.That is to say, we assume that after 1944, when our presentsurplus has  been exhausted,  unemployment over a period ofyears will average 15 - 4 or less, as compared with the    to i6f-originally suggested to us  for 1936-43  by the Committee onEconomic Information. , This is in accord with the expectationexpressed by us in  our Third Report  (paragraph 25) and sup-ported by  the Committee  on Economic  Information,  that,through gradual correction of maladjustment, the general trend of unemployment beneath the  ups and downs of  trade  fiuctua-tion will be downward for some time to come.  35. This assumption, however, cannot be carried  beyondcertain limits.  A time may come when we shall  find difficultyin distributing a non-recurrent surplus over any reasonably short period of years,  without incurring liabilities  which we shall be unable to meet after the surplus has been spent. This raises thequestion  of whether it would  be desirable,  by change of theexisting law,  to give us powers of great flexibility for dealingwith non-recurrent surpluses, by  reducing  the debt of  theUnemployment Fund.  36. By the Unemployment Insurance Act of 1934, the  debt of the Unemployment  Fund was funded  at  the  figure  of 105,780,000 at which it stood at 30th June, 1934, with  twofixed half-yearly payments  of   2,500,000 each,  covering prin-cipal  and interest,  to be made  on the 30th September and31st March:   After the payment  on 30th September, 1936, the debt of the Unemployment Fund stood at  104,741,034  is. nd.and was bearing interest at an average rate of 3 1-3 per cent. Atthe same date the Unemployment Fund had an accumulatedbalance of  34,281,000 in short-dated securities yielding anaverage rate of 1 1-3 per cent.; since then the balance increased,as stated, to   38,977,280 at 31st December, 1936 and&apos;is  stillrising.  37. In  these circumstances, the suggestion is often made thatthe accumulated reserve should be used in part at least to reducethe debt.  The suggestion calls for examination in the light of theactual provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1935.
   38-  Under the last paragraph of section 59 (2),  if we report; as we do on the present occasion, that the Unemployment Fund (General Account) is and is likely to continue to be more than reasonably  sufficient to discharge  its liabilities,  we may recom- mend application of any siim towards payment of the debt of the Fund.  Under the proviso to section 60 (2) this recommendation can be acted on, presumably by the Minister of Labour, without further authority.  A recommendation for payment of debt  is not a recommendation for the amendment of the Unemployment Insurance Act under the first part  of section 59 (2).  It does not need the assent of Parliament and the Minister is given no power to vary  it.  Our examination of  these provisions  leads  to the following conclusions: First, no payment of debt (apart from the statutory sinking fund named below) can be  made  unless we recommend it.   Second,  if we recommend application of  a surplus to payment of debt, the surplus  cannot be diverted to any other purpose.   39.  This makes our responsibility in the matter considerable, and calls for careful enquiry  as to  the  policy  of applying surpluses of the Unemployment Fund towards payment of debt. It is not always realised what the effect of such payment  would be.  The debt of the Unemployment Fund is now funded, with a  statutory  debt charge of  5,000,000 a  year which cannot be changed in any way without fresh  legislation. By means  of this debt charge the present debt will be  extinguished automatically in .1971.  The only effect of using  surpluses of the Fund to pay debt is to  bring about the  extinction of  the  debt somewhat earlier, without reducing the existing debt charge.  If,  for instance, the surplus of  16,500,000,  which we have ascertainedin the Unemployment Fund, were to be applied to additional repayment of debt, the only consequence  would  be to  cause the debt  to be extinguished and the debt charge of  5,000,000  ayear to come to an end, in the year 1963  in place of 1971.  Till 1963 matters would remain exactly as at present.  The surplus of  16,500,000 has been  accumulated by contributions  by orin respect of persons now or recently employed in the insuredtrades.   From these contributions  5,000,000  a year (repre-senting about  fd.  a week each from employer,  workman andthe State in  respect of each insured person in employment), isalready being taken in order  tq  extinguish a  debt incurredalmost wholly before the end of 1.931.  If we.were now to.use the  16,500,000 accumulated by recent contributions to pay offdebt, the only effect would be to relieve the three contributoryparties of a charge of  5,000,000 in each year from 1964 to1971, when  a large proportion of the present generation ofinsured persons would no  longer,-be in industry.      :  40. This use of the surplus  would not only make it impossiblefor a large  proportion of the present contributors to get  the
                            i6advantage of the surplus in better benefits.  It would exposethem to risk of losing some of the benefits which they now enjoy.If, through an unfavourable turn of events, we found later thatthe Unemployment Fund was deficient and that contributionsmust be raised or benefits must be lowered in order to correct the deficiency, we  should be compelled to deprive those whosecontributions had  gone to build up the surplus of something that they now enjoy; the surplus  would have been paid awayirretrievably.  If, on the other hand, we use the  16,500,000 togive the present contributors some immediate advantage and theposition takes a similar unfavourable turn,  we  should in  all probability be compelled at most to take away from them someof the  benefit of the surplus.   In  these circumstances,  with thefinal extinction of the debt so remote, we find it hard to believethat we should be doing justice to the present contributors to theFund,  already burdened with  liability for the  past debt,  byhastening by a few years the final extinction of the debt.  41. We realise, however, that it may be argued  against this that the contributors of the 1960&apos;s,  a full  generation after the debt was incurred, ought to get whatever relief is possible fromthe burden of the  debt charge.  And for the practical reasonsalready given,  we believe that it  might be an advantage to beable to use non-recurrent surpluses  for additional  repayment of debt,  if by revision of the existing law this  could  be done with greater justice, as between  present  and past or futurecontributors.  We suggest for consideration that if any oppor-tunity  for fresh legislation  on this matter offers itself, theopportunity might be taken to revise the existing law and secureextended powers for the treatment of debt.   42.  The particular changes which deserve examination aretwo in number: first, that payment of debt should be allowedto bring about a proportionate  reduction  of the debt  charge;second, that if any additional sum  is aUocated to  payment  ofthe debt  it should  be possible for the Unemployment Fundwithin a stated period, say eight years, to borrow again to meettemporary deficiencies either the  whole or a  certain proportionof the sum repaid, subject to suitable readjustment of the debtcharge.  The debt  at present stands at about   105,000,000.Under the  present  law,  if we  devoted, say,   10,500,000  to payment of debt, this payment would advance  the date of finalextinction from 1971 to 1965, while leaving the  debt chargeunchanged.  With the first change of law  suggested by us, thepayment of  10,500,000 would reduce the debt charge forth-with from  5,000,000 to  4,500,000 a year, while leaving thedate of final extinction unchanged or nearly unchanged. &apos; Thebenefit of debt reduction would be spread equally over the wholefunding period from present time onwards.  The second changesuggested would make it possible to recommend use of  surpluses
i7for payment of debt with  much greater  confidence than  atpresent, because we should be in a better position to deal withan unexpected unfavourable turn of events.  43. We make  these  suggestions for consideration, if andwhen an opportunity of fresh legislation presents itself.   their adoption might assist us in the disposal of a further surplus, ifa subsequent report revealed one.  In the present report we make no recommendation for payment of  debt  under the lastpart of section 59 (2).  We turn to consider those amendments of the Act which might be used to  dispose of  the surplus  inother ways.                  Disposal of the Surplus.  44. As  required by section  59 (3) of  the UnemploymentInsurance Act,  1935, we gave notice on 10th November,  1936,of our intention to make a report on the financial condition  ofthe Unemployment Fund.   We received representations  inwriting  and  orally  from  the  National  Confederation  ofEmployers&apos;  Associations,  the Trade Union Congress general council, and the Parliamentary Committee of the Co-operativeCongress.  45. The National Confederation of Employers&apos; Associationsurged that reduction of contributions  should be  regarded as a first charge on any surpluses that might become available, untilcontributions had reached a level of 6d. a week from each partyfor an adult workman, as compared with the iod. fixed in 1931and the 9d. now in force.   They realised that we were not likely in the present, or indeed in any  subsequent, year to havea surplus large enough to make a simultaneous all-round reduc-tion comparable to that of  last  year.  They urged, however,that we should proceed by stages, taking off what we  couldfrom one class of contributors at a time.  46. The Trade Union Congress General Council in writing to us placed  in order of priority for use of a surplus (1) abolitionof the waiting time, .,(2)  increase  of benefit rates  and (3) exten-sion of  the  period  of  benefit.   In oral  evidence, they  urgedthat if the surplus was not sufficient to abolish the waiting timealtogether, we should at least reduce it from its  present lengthof six days.   Among benefit rates,  they  regarded a furtherraising of the rate for dependent children as the most important.The form of extension of the benefit period favoured by them was the lengthening of the time, now 26 weeks, for which  everyinsured person qualifies  by payment of 30 contributions in twoyears.  47. The   Parliamentary   Committee  of  the  Co-operativeCongress supported the representations of the  Trades  UnionCongress General Council, particularly in  urging abolition  or reduction of the waiting time and opposing any  further reduc-tion of contributions.
                             i8  48. On  a review  of  these  representations  and all relevant considerations  we  reach  the  conclusion  that  the  most advantageous  use  to make of the surplus now at our disposallies in&apos; (1) reducing the waiting time from six days to three days and (2) extending the period of benefit by increasing the numberof additional days benefit that can be drawn  under Section 31by men who have  contributed regularly and drawn little benefit in the past five years.  Individual members of our committeewould have been glad if it had appeared possible to use part ofthe surplus in certain other ways-such as the increase of benefit for:women.  But with two exceptions we are satisfied that  thetwo changes indicated above represent an improvement of  theinsurance  scheme  which it  is highly desirable  to accomplish,now that the financial means are at our disposal.  49. The  question of the waiting time was  discussed brieflyin our Third  Report (paras. 59-61).   We  then gave  reasons why in  the view of most of  us  abolition or  reduction of  the waiting  time was  not then  a change  for which any urgencycould be claimed.  The considerations which now lead us torecommend reduction of the waiting week as one of the uses towhich the further surplus should be put are mainly three:  50. First, this is the  purpose now put first in  the  order of urgency by the representatives of the organised workmen.  Lastyear the Trades  Union Congress General Council  laid equalor greater emphasis on increasing the rates of benefit.  51. Second, the six  days waiting time means that at  thebeginning of a period of unemployment, unemployed persons as a rule have to wait much more than a week before receivingany substantial benefit.  The interval  between falling out ofwork and first payment of benefit varies with the day of makingthe claim, as set out in the following table:Operation of Waiting Time.

IQ  It is true, of course, that workmen  on leaving employment as a rule have some wages due to them;  nor should it be  im-possible for them  to make some  provision of their  own  forunexpected misfortune which would be enough to cover  thefirst days of unemployment.   But with the intervals shown inthe table above between falling out of work and drawing benefit,there  is  a  case  for reducing  the  waiting  time, now  thatopportunity offers.  52.  Third,  covering part  of  the  present  waiting  time  bybenefit is in  accord with the general  policy embodied in  theUnemployment Act of 1934 of improving the provision for  un-employment.   At present,  unemployed persons in the waitingtime,  if in  need, are relieved by public assistance authorities.As from the second appointed day on 1st April, 1937,  they  willbe qualified,  subject to  the  Means Test,  for allowances fromthe Unemployment Assistance Board.   It is impossible to say inadvance  how  many applications for allowances  are  likely tobe made by men in this position or to be successful.   But we hope  that a reduction of the  waiting time to  three days wouldin practice make recourse to allowances in the waiting timeunnecessary for most persons unemployed.  53. It may be added that though, for most of the time sinceunemployment insurance was made general in 1920, a six dayswaiting time has been in force, the original time in the Act of1920  was three days; the change to six days was made, in thefirst instance,  on grounds of  economy.  54.  Having regard to all  these considerations, we recommend,as the first  use of the surplus  now at our disposal in the general account  of the Unemployment Fund, that as from 1st April,1937,  the waiting time in the  general scheme should be reduced from  six days to three, leaving unchanged the rules as to con-discontinuity of  unemployment.   We estimate  that  on an  averagethis change will increase expenditure on benefit by  1,250,000a year.  In 7J years from 1st April, 1937, to 31st December,1944,  this will absorb  9,687,000, or in round figures  9,700,000out of the total of  17,250,000.  55.  Reduction of the waiting time gives new benefits at thebeginning of unemployment.   Our other proposal to  increasethe provision  of additional days extends benefit in  the later stages of unemployment.  Under the  law as it stands an insured person who  has paid30 contributions in  two years before  his claim can  draw benefit for 26 weeks, that is to say  156 days of unemployment.  Personswho in the past five years  have had relatively little unemploy-ment  may  be qualified for additional days of benefit beyondthe 156; fhe maximum number of additional days is  three for
every five,contributions  paid, less one for every five days ofbenefit drawn in the past five years.   Under this provision for additional days, introduced by the Act of 1934, it is possiblefor men ,of good industrial record to draw benefit for periods of unemployment  far in excess of 26  weeks; a special returnobtained by  the  Ministry of Labour  showed that  of the un-employed persons aged  18 to 64 in receipt  of  benefit on the8th June, 1936, 9-6 per cent, had been unemployed continuouslyfor six months or more, 4-7 per cent, for nine months or  moreand 2-6 per cent,  for 12 months or more.  A man who has paid contributions continuously for five years without obtaining any benefit can get 156  additional days, thatis to say he can now draw benefit for  12 months continuously.But if he has  drawn any benefit he  loses one  additional day for every five days of benefit drawn by him.   We suggest thatthe provision  of additional days should be made more ample,by subtracting one additional day for every eight days, in placeof evety five  days, of benefit already drawn.  56.  This proposal will increase  materially  the protection afforded by the insurance scheme to men who, after contributingregularly to the Fund and drawing little in benefit, experienceprolonged  unemployment;  apart  from special causes,  suchexperience  may be the result of advancing years or severe in-dustrial depression.   We believe that a more generous pro-vision of additional days is a better use of our present surplusthan the alternative way of extending the benefit period by increasing the  26  weeks given to every person who  has paid30 contributions in two years.  From  the point of view of the insured contributor, the power to draw 26 weeks of benefit bypaying  15  contributions a year, is  already  a  good  bargain;the 15 contributions may represent much less than 15 weeks of work.  To increase the 26 weeks period,  say to  28 weeks,would give two additional weeks of benefit  to large  numberswho thereafter would still have recourse to assistance.  To im-proVe  the  provision of  &quot;additional  days&quot;  may keep many men of good  industrial record from the need of assistance, inprolonged periods of unemployment.  57. The  cost of the  change that we propose, in substituting&quot; eight &quot; for &quot; five &quot;  as the number of days benefit  that shallreduce by  one day the claim for additional days is not easy to calculate.  The cost may be  expected to vary with the levelof unemployment, being low in years  of good trade and  risingmarkedly in  a depression.    According to the best  estimates that we, can make, the average cost, over a trade cycle, of thechange that we propose would be a little more than  1,000,000a  year.  We  suggest,  that the new provision  should  apply to benefit years beginning on or after 1st  January,  1937; the addi-tional cost will thus begin at various dates after 1st July,  1937,
                            21and will not be substantial before the last quarter of the year.The total cost up to the end of our eight-year period 1937-44would be approximately  7,550,000 and will thus absorb whatis left of our total of  17,250,000 after providing for reductionof the waiting time.  58.  We conclude  our report on the  financial condition of theUnemployment Fund in respect of its general account:      (1) By  reporting formally under section 59 (2): of the    Unemployment Insurance  Act, 1935, that  the  Unemploy-    ment Fund, in respect of its general account is, and is likely    to continue to be,  more than reasonably sufficient to  dis-    charge its liabilities.      (2) By recommending by a majority as changes required    to make the Fund, in respect  of its general account, not    more than reasonably sufficient:           (i)  that in section 31  (6) of the Act  in relation to         insured contributors other than agricultural  contribu-         tors for the word  &quot; week &quot; where it occurs for the         second time shall  be substituted  the words &quot; three         days  &apos;&apos;;           (ii) that in paragraph (6)  of section 31 (2) for the         word &quot; five &quot;  where it occurs for  the third time, shall         be substituted the  word  &quot; eight &quot;  so that the para-         graph will run as follows:               &quot;31. (2) (b) the maximum number of addi-             tional days in any benefit year shall be computed,             in the case of an  insured contributor qualified for             such days, by allowing to him days at the rate of             three for every five contributions paid in respect             of him as an insured contributor in  respect of the             last five years, less one day for every eight days in             rpspect of which benefit has been paid to him in             respect of the benefit years which ended in the last             five years.&quot;           (iii) that the change in para, (i) above shall operate         as from 1st April, 1937, and that  the change in para.         (ii) above shall apply to  benefit  years  beginning on         and or after 1st January, 1937.       (3) By estimating that this recommendation will increase    the  expenditure of the Fund by approximately  2,250,000    a year or  17,250,000 in the eight year period  1937-44.   59. Before preparing, a year ago,  our third Report on the Financial, Condition of the General Account of the Unemploy- ment Fund at 31st December, 1935, we consulted the Committee on Economic Information, and in the  light  of a statement made1 3
by them to us, we took as the unemployment for which it was reasonable&quot; to make provision over the eight-year period 1936-43a mean percentage of i6f, of which 48 per cent, would rank for benefit.  On  this basis and having regard to the accumulatedreserve of  21,450,000 at the end of 1935 we made  proposalswhich were accepted by the Government for reducing contribu-tions by id. a week  for each party at the cost of  6,500,000 ayear to the Fund. If our expectations  as to unemployment in1936-43 were to be realised exactly, we should during the courseof those eight years use the whole of the accumulated reserve of31st December, 1935 (paras. 8-9).  60.  Though, however, we  contemplated using up during thecourse of  the  eight years the whole  of  the reserve  with whichwe began, we expected that during 1936 and one  or two subse-quent years, we should add to the reserve.  If our  original ex-pectations for 1936 had been exactly realised we should, by theend  of the  year, have turned  our accumulated  reserve  of 21,450,000  in  the General  Account  into a  reserve  of 32,272,000.   Our actual reserve at 31st December, 1936, is 38,977,280,  that is  to say,  6,700,000 above expectations for1936 (paras. 12-13).  61.   It seems nearly certain also that our original expectationsfor the year 1937  will be exceeded.   In view of the  assurancewith  which Mr. H. D. Henderson, on behalf of the Committeeon Economic Information,  spoke  to us of  the prospects  ofemployment  during the  current calendar  year,  there  is  ahigh probability that during 1937 we shall gain, not the sum of 5,325,000 originally expected  by us, but  17,600,000, thatis to say,  we shall be  12,275,000 better than our  original ex-pectations. This is a high probability, not a certainty. But wehave felt justified in  bringing into account, as if it were alreadyrealised, 80  per cent, of this further gain, or  9,820,000 alto-gether.  We  assume that in spite of these gains above expecta-tions in 1936 and  1937 there is as yet no ground for changingin either direction  our expectations for the rest of  the  eight-year period 1936-43 (paras. 14 and 26-29).  62. Adding these  two sums of   6,700,000 realised  above ex-pectations in 1936 and  9,820,000 as nearly certain to be realisedabove expectations in 1937, we  reach, as our total disposablesurplus in the general account of the Unemployment Fund, asum of  16,500,000  (para. 29).   Allowing for interest, the total for  additional  expenditure,  over  a  period   of  years,  is 17,250,000  (para. 31).   We recommend that this  sum shouldbe disposed of over  the  eight-year period 1937-44 by improvingin two ways  the provision for unemployment: (a) by reducingas from 1st April, 1937, from six days to three the waiting timefor which no benefit is paid at the beginning of a continuous
period of unemployment.   This is estimated to cost, in the eighth-year period 1937-44,1 about  9,700,000; : (b) by increasing inbenefit years beginning on or after 1st January, 1937, die iiurn-ber of additional days of benefit that can be drawn by men whohave worked regularly during the past five years while  drawingrelatively little in benefit.   The particular change that we pro-pose is estimated to cost in the eight-year period 1937-44 about 7.550,000 (para,  57).   63. Before proceeding to these recommendations for disposalof a surplus in the general account of the Unemployment Fundwe make a brief survey of the course of unemployment duringthe past 12 months and call attention to two factors limiting theprospects of further improvement, namely: (a) the tendency for unemployment even  in  prosperous  districts  to  find  aminimum of 5, 6 or even 7 per cent., beyond which further re-duction appears to be difficult; (b) the high level of unemploy-ment in  many  rural areas and the large proportion of it thatranks for benefit (paras.  15-24).   64.. We discuss  also the question of using surpluses of theUnemployment  Fund for  reduction  of its  funded  debt, givereasons why we do not now propose such a use, and suggest forconsideration certain  amendments of the statutory provisionsnow governing this matter (paras. 30 and 35-43).                 We have the honour to be, Sir,                           Your obedient servants,                          W. H.  BEVERIDGE (Chairman).                          A. L.

                  MINORITY  REPORT.  (i) While being in agreement with the general findings as tothe financial condition  of  the  Unemployment Fund, we  areunable to agree to the  disposal of  the surplus of   17,000,000mentioned in the Report in the manner recommended  by themajority of the Committee.  (2) The  spending of  the surplus on  further benefits meansadding fully  2,000,000 a  year to  the liabilities of the Fund,i.e. approximately 5 per cent.v, and while so much debt remains,and contributions are still higher than their pre-emergency levelof 1931,  we feel that the present surplus should not be used tocreate further financial liabilities on the Fund.  (3) We take  the view that the money  should  be  used for reducing the present rates of contributions, or if that is  not done,for reducing the debt of  105,000,000 which is still due by theUnemployment Fund.  (4) That debt was in  the main incurred during the  abnormaltrade depression,  when the  unemployment figure rose from1,400,000 to 2,800,000 and when contributions were raised, forexample,  in the case of the adult male from 8d. Employer,7d. Worker, and 7^d. State, to  iod. all round.  (5) That period  of deep depression has passed the unem-ployment figure is now 1,600,000 and we are now in  the midstof a period of comparative prosperity, and for the last  two years have accumulated considerable surpluses  which  have beendevoted to increasing the Childrehs Allowances by is.  a weekand reducing the contributions  from iod. to gd.  (6) We believe that the existing rates and conditions  of benefitare, on the whole fair and reasonable, and while the  contribu-tions are still above their pre-emergency level and the Fund isstill encumbered with a heavy debt, we feel strongly that thepresent non-recurrent surplus should not be used to create addi-tional liabilities which may prove very difficult to retrace in thefuture should necessity arise, and which, by placing an unneces-sary strain on the finance of the system, must inevitably causeus  to contemplate with  misgiving  the possible emergence of a subsequent serious trade depression.  (7) While we are prepared even under the existing provisionsof  the Act to use a surplus for payment of debt, and cannot accept the whole-of the  arguments in paragraphs 39 and 40, we agree with the  suggestions  contained  in the  Report that thepowers of the  Committee with reference to the liquidation ofthe debt  should  be enlarged,  and that  they  should  be givenpowers of greater flexibility for  dealing with non-recurrentsurpluses by reducing the debt  of the Unemployment  Fund.

25ITo the Rt. Hon. ERNEST BROWN, M.C., M.P.,        Minister of Labour.SIR,  By section 8 (i)  of the Unemployment Insurance (Agricul-ture)  Act, 1936, we are  required  to  exercise  our function  ofreporting on the financial condition  of the Unemployment Fund,separately in  respect of  its  General and  of  its  AgriculturalAccounts.  We submit below our first report in respect of theAgricultural Account.First Report on the Agricultural Account  of the Unemployment               Fund as at 31st December, 1936.  1.  In pursuance of a Report made by ourselves at the end of1934, unemployment insurance was applied to agriculture, in-cluding horticulture and forestry,  by the  Unemployment In-surance (Agriculture)  Act, 1936, which came into operation for payment of contributions on the 4th May last.   Unemploymentbenefit under this Act was not  payable for any day before the5th November.  2. We attach in the  second part of Appendix A a formalaccount of the receipts and  expenditure of the  Fund on theagricultural  side up to  31st  December,  1936, similar to that given in the first part of the Appendix for the  General  Scheme.The receipts of the agricultural account shown in  this  tablewere  793,550 of which all but  350 represented insurance con-tributions by employers, employed persons  and the State.  Theexpenditure was  146,175, made up of  46,500 for unemploy-ment benefit during the last two months and  99,675 for ad-ministrative and minor items covering the  whole eight monthssince the beginning of Agricultural  insurance.   Income exceededexpenditure  accordingly  by  647,375,  which is the  balanceshown in the account at the  end of 1936.  In accordance witha recommendation made by ourselves in our original Report onthe  application ^of insurance  to agriculture, the administrative expenses of the agricultural  scheme  have  been taken as one-eighth of the net contribution income.   3.  It is clearly impossible for us to  express any opinion  as tothe  financial solvency or  otherwise of the  agricultural schemeafter this short experience, and accordingly we make no recom-mendation for any change in that scheme.  Though we  gavestatutory notice on 10th November,  1936, of our intention toreport on the  financial condition  of  the  Unemployment fund in respect of the Agricultural Account, we received no repre-sentations thereon from interested bodies or persons.   It  may,
however,  be of interest to show how the experience of thescheme so far as it has gone at present compares with expecta-tions in respect of numbers insured and unemployed.  4. In our Report of December, 1934, recommending the appli-cation of unemployment insurance to Agriculture, we estimatedthat the  scheme proposed by  us would  cover  approximately750,000 persons aged 14-64, of whom 703,000would be malesand 47,000 females.  As appears from the table below, the number of  unemploy-ment books issued under  the agricultural scheme is materiallyless than this.Estimated numbers insured under the Agricultural Scheme             (excluding Private Gardeners).Farming, Forestry, etc. ...Market Gardening, Horticulture.Other Gardening ...Males.467,000 64,300 33,7ooFemales.  23,000  11,700    300 Total.490,000 76,000 34,000Total ..565,00035.000600,000  It seems likely  that  the deficiency  below  expectation  is accounted  for in part by  the fact that  a number of personsworking in agriculture are also the holders  of  unemploymentbooks under the General Scheme.   If this is so the numbers of people  paying  contributions sometimes under  the  GeneralScheme and sometimes under the Agricultural Scheme will be materially larger than had originally been expected. It does not seem likely, however, that this possibility can account for any-thing  but  a  small proportion  of the difference  between the600,000 shown in the table above and the 750,000 estimated inour original Report.  Whether the difference is due to delay&apos; by agricultural employers and their employees in taking our unem-ployment books or to a real decline in the number, of agricul-tural workers  since the census, or to  some other factor cannot yet be stated.  5. In respect of unemployment, the percentage of the numbersinsured who were recorded as unemployed, taking all  classes ofworkers  aged 16-64  together,  was  3 per cent,  on  the  23rdNovember  and 4-4 per cent, on the 14th December. Both  thesefigures are  materially below the rate of unemployment, namely7! per cent., upon which the finance of the Agricultural Schemeis based, but naturally no  conclusion of any kind can be drawn from  this  fact as  to the  future level  of  unemployment inagriculture.                                  .....  6.  The table  given above of  estimated  numbers insureddistinguishes between farming,  market  gardening and  othergardening and distinguishes also between  males and females.

In  farming the per-centage  of unemployment among  females is  nearly five timesthat among males;  in  market gardening it is more  than sixtimes; in other gardening it is more than three times as high.How far this is a purely temporary phenomenon due to the incidence of seasonal unemployment upon men and womenrespectively, it is impossible yet to say. On the figures recordedup to the present, it is fortunate for the solvency of the Agricul-tural Account  that the numbers of women employed in  this industry are relatively small.  It will obviously be a matter ofgreat interest to observe the course of unemployment in agricul-ture as a whole, and among the various sections of those engagedin it.

If the latter        were excluded,  the percentages would usually be about 0-2 higher.  The figures in Cols.  (3) and (4) exclude Special Schemes.(2) There was no change in the rates of contribution between November,  1931 and September, 1934.  As from  3rd September,  1934,  juveniles under 16        became insurable the rate of contribution being 2d. each from Employer,  Worker.and  State irrespective of sex.  As  from 6th July,  1936 the        rates of contribution for persons aged 18 and  over  were each reduced by id. from each party.(3) As from 1st  July, 1934, the rates of benefit were restored  to the levels in operation before -8th October, 1931, when an Economy  cut  of  10 per  cent.        was imposed.(4) As from 26th July, 1934, tne amount of benefit payable in a benefit year was increased by the grant of additional days under Section 3, Unemployment        Insurance Act,  1934,  &apos;n cases where there had been  a  good contribution record in the five years preceding the claim.   This, and the increase in        the rates of benefit, account largely for the increased expenditure on benefit after June,  1934.(5) As from 31st October, 1935, the weekly rate of benefit for each dependent child was  increased from  2s. to 3s.  at  an estimated  annual cost  of about        ^1,250,000 a year.(6) The figures of Income and  Expenditure  are provisional figures prior to the detailed examination of the relevant account.(7) The funded debt of the Unemployment Fund at 1st July,  1934, was  105,780,000; repayment is being made at the rate of  5,000,000 a year including        principal and interest.(8) Income for 1935  and  1936 includes interest on investments : 1935, May  24,000,   August,   21,000,  October,   99,000 ;    1936,   February   22,000,        August  181,000.
