CALEDONIAN PO/QR ORDER. 1957 .      PRODUCTION OF CALCIUM CARBIDE.Memorandum &quot;by&apos; the Minister for Go-ordina.tion      &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; &apos;&quot;&quot;^bf &quot;lief e rice 7        In compliance with the Cabinet decision(Cabinet 8(37)) on 17th February,  1937, with  reference  tothe Caledonian power Order, 1937,  I  submit a  report  onthe question of the importance of  a  calcium carbide  factoryfrom the point of view of Imperial Defence and on  other questions arising on the Order.    This report in  so faras the facts are concerned has been  agreed with  theBoard of Trade.2.      The importance of calcium  carbide to  defence isthat, at present, it is the accepted source for  theproduction of acetylene.5o      Acetylene is used in oxy-acetylene welding whichis accepted at present as necessary  to the making  of aircraft and is also essential, and  becoming more  andmore essential, in the heavy metal industries, for munitionsas well as other types of production,,   Acetylene  is also an initial chemical product used in  connection with  anumber of important munitions requirements.4.      The latest Board of Trade  paper prepared for theCommittee on Reserves of Raw Materials, estimates  that,in time of emergency, the total demand for calcium carbide
                                                        9 9 9                                                        f* eJ eiwould show an increase over the normal consumption,  whichlatter is at the rate of 60,000 tons per annum.   This isthe demand for all forms of industry, the 5,000 tonsoccurring in an earlier Board of  Trade paper andmentioned in Cabinet on the 17th February being the thenestimated figure for direct service requirements only.5.      Present imports come from the continent ofEurope, to the extent of nearly cue half from Norway.6.      The exact present facts as to production inCanada are somewhat uncertain&quot;.   There is, however,considerable production there, mainly at present throughthe Shawinigan Company, &quot;which is stated to have capacityat the rate of 100,000 tons a year though production isnow at the rate of 67,000 tons a yeara   In ordinaryconditions the Canadian product cannot compete in theBritish market by reason mainly of the heavy cost ofpacking the product for the long sea journey and in emergency this consideration would lose at least some ofits cogency.7.      It is a clear Service interest that uninterruptedsupplies of calcium carbide should be available in thecountry in emergency.3.      AS stated in my previous memorandum (CP. 55(37))production in this country cculd be set on foot inemergencjr as it was in the last war, but the time requiredto start production  would not be less than six monthso9.      It may be maintained that supplies will beavailable whether from Norway or Canada,  so long as  the
seas are open,  and that,  if the seas are not kept open,the loss of calcium carbide will not rank very highin the evils which would follow.10.     In the case, however, of other essential imported-raw materials, where a shortage of world stocks, coupled with the risks of sea transport in emergency, would have created serious difficulties for us, it has been thoughtwise to provide in peace reserves against these contin-gencies.   Such a reserve has recently been actuallyapproved by the Defence Policy and Requirements Committeeill the case of ferro-chrome, one of the materials not nowproduced here at all but proposed to be produced underthe Caledonian Power Order.   Consideration of a reserve of calcium carbide will also have to be taken up:   ithas been deferred pending a decision by the Governmenton the Caledonian Power Scheme.11.     The above indicates the view I submit as to theimportance of safeguarding in emergency supplies of someof the principal materials to be produced under theCaledonian Power Scheme.   If the scheme goes through,the future will be fully safeguarded as soon as the works are completed, and I assume that such safeguarding is animportant defence interest, especially when it can beobtained as in this case without any expenditure of public money.   The question whether the production should besited in the Highlands or South hales depends on con-siderations other than the defence interest.   j\s safe a site as possible is needed5 but, from that point alone,there does not seem to be very much advantage for onelocality as against the other.                          -3-
Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.   26th February, 1937.12.     The Electricity Commissioners have given carefulconsideration to the estimated cost of generation of current under the Order, and have prepared a full memor-andum.   I have not circulated this to the Cabinet,except to the Secretary of State for Scotland and theMinister of Labour, as it largely consists of calculationsand analyses of figures.   The Commissioners come to theconclusion that the cost under the scheme may be as high as 0*1508d. per unit while the cost at a coal fired stationmay be as low as 0*165d. per unit.   I am not in a positionto express any opinion as to the estimates of costs madeby the promoters.   These are matters which a Private BillCommittee would consider.                           (Intld.)
