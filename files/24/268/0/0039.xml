THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1937,Copy No.CABINET.PROPOSED INTRODUCTION  OF  THE  SYSTEM OF IMPERIAL                   PREFERENCE IN NIGERIA.        Memorandum by the Secretary of State  for  Foreign Affairs.    THE memorandum circulated to the Cabinet  by the Secretary of State forthe Colonies on the question whether or not Imperial Preference should now beintroduced into Nigeria  discusses the arguments for and against this proposalobjectively and dispassionately.  I feel, however, that the arguments against thescheme are the stronger, for the following reasons :     (1)  The  scheme will only  benefit British trade to a maximum  extent  of 750,000, and that only after a period of years.  It seems probable, and indeedlikely,  that the  actual benefit  will  be considerably less.   It might even be a negative quantity in the event of successful retaliatory  action by foreign Powers.    (2)  There is, apparently, no suggestion that the scheme, if introduced, will improve either the standard of  living of the Nigerian  native or the finances ofthe colony;  though I understand that suitable safeguards have been devised inorder to prevent its having a positively prejudicial effect on the one or the other.    (3)  Largely for the  sake, therefore, of the rather  problematical advantagereferred to in (1) above,  we  are asked to take action  which would admittedlyembarrass our relations with  the United States of America.  The United StatesGovernment  have,  during the  past year,  shown themselves to be  particularlysensitive not only in regard to the general trade policy of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, but also in regard to  the particular question of United States tobaccoimports into Nigeria.  In this  connexion I would call  attention to  the annexedextracts from two despatches  to  His  Majesty&apos;s  Ambassador in  Washingtonrecording conversations  which  I had with the American Ambassador on  the26th October  and the 21st November last.  It is  therefore inevitable  that  anextension of the  area covered  by Imperial Preference involving a direct blow to a fairly important American industry will be keenly resented by the UnitedStates Government in general and Mr. Hull in  particular.  Moreover, arguments(i) and  (ii) in the Colonial Secretary&apos;s memorandum, more especially the latter,are of great importance  from the point of view of our foreign policy  generally.    (4)  On the other hand, I am not sure that argument (vii) in the colonial secretary&apos;s memorandum is really so formidable as it may seem at first sight, since,even in the event of the  Dominions and India  depriving Nigeria of the benefits of preference (which appears to be unlikely),  the  resulting  damage to Nigeriawould be inconsiderable.   On the principle involved I shall have something to saylater.  Similarly, the tu quoque argument in (viii), though perfectly valid, is only of limited force so far as the United States are concerned, since the  volume oftrade between the United States and Cuba and the Philippines is much smaller than that between the various members of the British Commonwealth.    (5) There remains what is perhaps the main contention advanced by  theColonial  Secretary.  In  fact,  if we do not  introduce a  system of  imperial preference into Nigeria, now that  we have the opportunity, we may be accusedboth of illogicality and  of lack  of faith  in  the  general system  of  imperial preference.  I would not dispute the fact that both these accusations may wellbe made,: or that they may even prove to be embarrassing.  But I suggest that the       9082  [14780]SECRET.CP. 89 (37).
practical disadvantages and even dangers which are inherent in the scheme fromthe point of view of our foreign policy outweigh any disadvantages of a theoreticalnature, however/ justified these last may be.    I would accordingly strongly urge my colleagues, both for the reasons I haveexpressed and for those put forward  in the  memorandum of  the  Secretary ofState for the Colonies, not to apply the scheme.                                                                    A. E.    March 8,  1937.ANNEX.                                 &apos; &quot;  (A)     ^ &apos;  &quot;.&apos;     Extract from Despatch to  Washington  (No. 941) of  October 26, 1936.    THE United States  Ambassador asked to see me this afternoon,  when he stated that there were two subjects about which he wished to  speak to me.  Thefirst was a  change which Mr. Bingham said  he understood  was shortly  to be proposed in the tariff of  our West African colonies.   This change the UnitedStates Government- appear to consider would  adversely  affect important  trade interests in  that  county,  more especially the export of tobacco.   Mr. Binghamexplained to me that certain cheap types of American tobacco had for long hada special position in  the West African market.  They played, I understood, inthe life of the&apos;West African native, the unexpected  dual  role of coinage andchewing-gum.   This privileged position,  he feared, might now be affected by theproposed changes.  The United States  Ambassador asked me particularly onbehalf of his Government to do all in my power to ensure that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would not do anything at this time to increase tariff duties, moreespecially since the main  international preoccupation should  now  be to reducetrade barriers.  The Ambassador added that further to increase obstacles to trade at this time scarcely seemed to be consistent with the recent declarations of policy by His Majesty&apos;s Government.    2.  I told Mr. Bingham that I had myself no information on this subject,but I would  make enquiries and let him have a reply in due course.                                    (B)    Extract from Despatch to Washington (No. 1000) of November 21, 1936.    6.  Finally, the Ambassador  asked me whether I could yet give  him any information as to the possibility of His Majesty&apos;s Government extending imperial preference to  West African trade.   He would not disguise from me that theUnited  States Government were very interested in this matter.  I replied thatthis question was still under consideration by the Departments concerned.  the ambassador, in  accepting this reply, stated that he would be extremely grateful to me if I would give him another opportunity to  discuss this matter before any final action was taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government.   I undertook to do this.
