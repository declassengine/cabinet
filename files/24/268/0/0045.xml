APPENDIX.(Secret.)   ,Sir,&apos;  .                                    Downing Street, March 15, 1937.  &apos;   &apos; I HAVE  the  honour to  inform you  that the various  issues raised in Sir Arthur Wauchope&apos;s secret despatch &quot; A &quot; of the 26th January were discussed at  an  inter-departmental  conference  held  at the  Colonial  Office  on  the16th February.  The conference was attended by the High Commissioner; by theChief of the Imperial General Staff and the Director of Military Operations onbehalf of the Army Council; and by the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff on behalfof the Air Council.   The Foreign Office was also represented.  In the succeedingparagraphs of this despatch are set out the agreed conclusions reached as a resultof that conference.    2.  The general principle is accepted that so long as the Civil Governmentof Palestine is carrying out its normal functions, that is to say, until the HighCommissioner delegates powers  to the General Officer  Commanding the forces under the Order in  Council which will shortly replace the Palestine (Defence)Orders in Council, 1931 and 1936, the High Commissioner,  as head of the civil government of Palestine, must be the supreme and final authority on questions affecting the security of Palestine. The possibility, however, cannot be excludedof a conflict of opinion between the High Commissioner and the General OfficerCommanding, and the General Officer Commanding might feel  that compliance with the High Commissioner^ decision would  seriously prejudice the dischargeof his responsibilities, either at the moment, or in the future looking to a timewhen powers  might be delegated to  him.   In the event of any irreconcilabledisagreement, it would be the duty of  the High Commissioner to report fully and immediately to the Secretary of State  for the Colonies, and, at the same time, theGeneral  Officer Commanding would report direct to the War Office, stating bisreasons  for disagreeing with the High Commissioners decision.  It would be forHis Majesty&apos;s Government to  take a final decision in the matter, and thereuponthe necessary instructions would be sent simultaneously to the High commissioner and to the General Officer Commanding.  In the event of the High CommissionerConsidering that the matter requires immediate action, the High Commissioner^decision must hold.   It  is, of course, recognised  that  the  High  commissioner would be incurring a grave responsibility in declining to accept the advice of theGeneral  Officer  Commanding on a question of security, but it clearly would benecessary for  the  High Commissioner,  if  he considered that  circumstanceswarranted it,  to accept  that  responsibility  and  to act accordingly,  pendingreference of the matter to His Majesty&apos;s Government.     3.   As regards the various points summarised in enclosure 3 to the despatchunder reference, the following conclusions were reached  :                            (1) Strength of garrison.     It is agreed that seven battalions, two  at Colonial Establishment and five atHome Establishment, with the troops in Egypt which have been earmarked forreinforcement if required, should suffice for present circumstances.                         (2) &apos;&apos; Commander-in-Chief.&apos;&apos;     It is agreed that the powers of the High Commissioner as  &quot; Commander-in-Chief &quot;  do not include direct command of the forces.             (3)  Use of His Majesty&apos;s Forces in aid of  civil power .   ..  It is agreed that it is the function of the High Commissioner to call for troops,either to prevent  or  to suppress disorder, whenever and wherever they  arerequired^ but it is the function of the  General Officer Commanding to decide how the troops should be used for either of these purposes.  It would, however, be opento the High  Commissioner to require any  specific plan of military  action to be modified, if  he considered that it  would  lead to dangerous  consequences on political or religious grounds.  In the event of the General Officer Commanding
disagreeing for military reasons with the decision of the High Commissioner asto when and where troops should be.employed, it will be open to him, should heconsider the point of difference of sufficient importance on military grounds, torefer the matter  at once to the War Office, with a view to the difference.beingresolved by His Majesty&apos;s Government, but pending the decision of His Majesty;&apos;sGovernment he will comply with the High Commissioner&apos;s request.,, , .... .  (4). Use of troops to: show themselves in, the streets as a deterrent -to, disorder A     The General Officer Commanding will comply with a request from the HighCommissioner that the troops, when  sent to  a  particular place, should show themselves  as a deterrent to disorder, unless he is satisfied that such method ofemployment would endanger their safety.   (5) Stage at which powers under Statutory Martial Law should be delegated                       to General Officer Commanding:                 .,  ....     [NOTE. The  expression  &quot;Statutory Martial  Law &quot; has  been used, f Orconvenience  to describe the powers which might have been delegated by the HighCommissioner to  the General  Officer Commanding under the Palestine martial law (Defence) Order in  Council, 1936.  This expression,  however, which will no longer be appropriate, will not be used when reference is made in the succeedingparagraphs  of this despatch to the powers which may be delegated by the HighCommissioner to  the General  Officer Commanding under the Order in council which will  shortly replace the  Palestine (Defence&quot;) Orders in Council, 1931 and1936.]                                                            ,      -    No difference of opinion between  the High Commissioner and the GeneralOfficer Commanding appears to exist on  this point, and the views  summarised in  enclosure 3 are accepted,  viz., that the  decision whether or not powers  shouldbe  delegated to the General Officer Commanding under the Order in Council must rest  with the High Commissioner.                                  .                  (6) Policy in the event of further disorders. \    ,    -  o    ,    No difference of opinion between the High Commissioner and the GeneralOfficer Commanding appears  to exist on this  point  and the view  summarised in  enclosure 3 is accepted, viz., that a different and firmer policy will be necessary.In expressing his agreement the High Commissioner  records,  in  the  summary,the following view : &quot; It is evident that the position of His Majesty-s Governmentand of the High Commissioner, when awaiting the recommendations of the RoyalCommission concerning  the grievances of the people, must be different from their position after His Majesty&apos;s Government have given their final- decisions.  If theArabs rebel  against these  final  decisions, then they must be crushed even if suchaction  leaves bitterness  afterwards.&quot;      (7) Distinction on a future occasion between an isolated, riot and                             organised disorder.                    ,      ..    The point at issue here is covered  by what  has  been agreed  as regardspoint (5); that is to say, the decision must rest with the High Commissioner.                  (8) Responsibility for location of troops,-.   .     --    This point  appears  to  refer to the  question of the location  of troops  in normal  times when there is no actual disturbance, whether at their permanentstations  or possibly  when assigned to  some particular station where they  arelikely to be required to ensure security for  some months..  ... j  .   &apos; In  the event of the  General&apos; Officer Commanding differing from the,HighCommissioner, the matter would  be  referred to His Majesty&apos;s Government, for decision, and  presumably the question of  urgency would  not arise, yvith .theresult that there would be time to obtain a decision, from&apos;His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment before action need be taken.                                      .&apos;.\:^:;&apos;[14847]\                          ,  &apos;        ....&apos;.7--m  tm
          ;   ,(9). Responsibility Jor calling for reinforcement.  , .  ,  , ,    - No difference of opinion appears to exist&apos; on . this point between the High . - Commissioner and &quot;the  General;  Officer  Commanding:  and  their  ,views  as - summarised in enclosure 3 are accepted;  viz., that the High Commissioner agrees - with the General Officer Commanding: that responsibility  should rest with the High Commissioner, but that in the event of a conflict of opinion it should be open to the General Officer Commanding to represent his views independently to  the  War Office.   In  asking for reinforcements  the. High  Commissioner would   naturally inform  the  Colonial  Office  whether  the  General  Officer Commanding agreed. (10)  Difference between Martial Law and &quot;Statutory Martial Law.&quot;      [See note under (5).]     There  does not appear to be  ground  for fear  that the  provisions for delegating powers to the General Officer Commanding under the Order in Council Avhich will  shortly replace  the Palestine (Defence) Orders in Council,  1931 and 1936, would involve any friction or impede the freedom of action of the General Officer Commanding.  The High Commissioner,  in paragraph 14 of his  despatch, has made it clear that, in the event of a situation arising which,  in his opinion, weuld  justify the delegation of powers, it is his intention to delegate the full powers  thereunder to the General Officer Commanding  without delay.  It would then  be necessary for the General Officer Commanding  to make such regulations as  he needed, and to act upon them.     The situation that would obtain when powers are  delegated  to the General- Officer Commanding must depend on the nature  and extent of the outbreak which brought .about such delegation of powers.     Speaking generally,  all services which are  most likely to  be  affected by the outbreak--such as Police,  Railways, Postal, &amp;c. would  naturally come under the control of the General Officer Commanding.  Other services would remain under the Civil Government.  In accordance as  the situation developed, it might occur that the control of the General Officer Commanding should extend to  cover some or all of these other services;  or,  alternatively, the  practical execution of these services would be suspended until normal conditions were re-established, or on. the way to being re-established.  This is a matter which can,  in fact, only be settled when the occasion arises and powers have been delegated  to the General Officer Commanding.     When  powers are delegated to the  General Officer Commanding, the High Commissioner, or his representative in the event of his absence from the country, would  continue to be responsible for the discharge of the functions of the  Civil Government not delegated to the General Officer Commanding; and, in addition, he would afford political advice to the  General Officer Commanding in respect of  Palestine. The intention is that the High Commissioner^ position in relation to  Transjordan,  as a separate entity from Palestine, shall not be  affected by the delegation of powers to the  General Officer Commanding;  but it is clear that such- intention may be frustrated by the extension  of disorder to Transjordan, in which case  steps would have to  be taken by the  High Commissioner, through the Amir  of  Transjordan,  to secure  that  the  control  of  the General  Officer Commanding would be  extended  to  cover Transjordan.   It is  impossible to legislate beforehand in more detail for developments  after  the  delegation of powers to the General Officer Commanding in Palestine.      It  is the intention,  after the delegation of powers to the  General Officer Commanding, that the Civil  Courts should continue to carry on their ordinary civil work.   As  regards the criminal work, it is contemplated that the Military Courts, which: are to be established, would try offences against  the Emergency Regulations, and such offences against the ordinary law as are committed against His Majesty&quot;- Forces (including the Police if and when  handed over) or otherwise form part of the disturbances.  The jurisdiction of the Civil Courts, in criminal; matters would extend to all cases other than these;      The possibility cannot, be disregarded that the disturbances might amount to a rebellion  so serious, widespread and effective, that there was a complete..break- down of the functions of civil government.  Such a situation would demand,.&apos;more; active - measures to cOmbat it, amounting,it may be, to the assumption by,, the-
-General Officer Commanding, on the score of necessity, of overriding and plenarypowers to restore the situation.   It is not necessary to consider this  situationfurther than to make it clear that it constitutes a state of affairs, should it arise,entirely different from that visualised for the delegation of powers to the GeneralOfficer Commanding, and one that must be dealt with as and if it arises, with the,sole aim in view of restoring order with the minimum of delay.                 (11) Withdrawal of Statutory Martial Law.                             (See note under (5).)     The  decision  to  withdraw  the powers  delegated  to  the General  OfficerCommanding must be with His Majesty&apos;s Government and this decision  would betaken  in the light of advice tendered  by the High  Commissioner  and  theGeneral Officer  Commanding,  but the formal act  of withdrawing the powersdelegated  to the General Officer  Commanding will be that  of the High  Com-missioner.     4.   In addition to the points summarised in enclosure 3 to the High  Com-missioner&apos;s despatch conclusions were reached.upon the following supplementary,questions:- (i)  The method of  employing Jews to assist the Government forces in the  event                           of  further disturbances.               . /&apos;(a)  Prior to the delegation of powers to the  General Officer Commanding.     There was general agreement with the High  Commissioner^ opinion thatJews should  be employed for defensive purposes only, and only in areas mainlyJewish.   This, in effect, would  restrict their employment before the delegation ofpowers to the General Officer  Commanding, to the protection of their own colonies.But while it is not contemplated that Jews should  actually be employed for theprotection of railway or other communications until powers have been delegated to  the  General  Officer Commanding, arrangements might  be made  for  their training now in limited numbers with a view to using their services for protectivework of this nature if the need arises.  Any such  training should, however, becarried out with,  the utmost  discretion, in order to avoid giving the impression in Palestine,  or outside Palestine, that His Majesty&apos;s Government already foreseethat after the publication of their decisions upon the report of the Royal  Coin-mission a state of affairs will inevitably prevail in which the forces of authority will be ranged against the  Arab population.  As  regards the employment  of jews even for defensive purposes in predominantly Moslem areas, it was agreedthat this would be politically most undesirable.(b)  A fter the delegation of powers to. the General Officer Commanding.     When powers have been delegated to the General Officer Commanding,  the-decision as to the extent and  method of the employment of Jews, in common withany other members of the community who could be considered  reliable, would resfwith the General Officer Commanding, but  it would be open to the High  Com-missioner (or acting  High Commissioner), as Political Adviser to the GeneralOfficer Commanding, to report  to the Colonial  Office in the event of the GeneralOfficer Commanding  deciding,  in disregard of his  advice, to  employ  Jews  forpurposes or in circumstances to which there might appear to be grave  politicalobjection, and the matter would then be considered by His Majesty&apos;s-Government.     It was further agreed that in view of  the possibly serious reactions whichmight thereby be provoked in neighbouring Arab countries, the General OfficerCommanding should not, in  any circumstances, decide to use Jews for  offensivepurposes, without the prior authority  of His Majesty&apos;s Government.(ii)  The necessity or otherwise for earmarking two weak battalions to replace   disaffected Arab Government officials, &amp;c, in the event of a general strike.     It was agreed  that the occurrence of a general  strike amongst government employees, especially the police,  railway and postal officials, would  probablyjustify the immediate delegation of powers  to the General Officer  Commanding.&apos;Even if a general strike were imminent, but had not actually been declared, the&quot;
 delegation of powers to the General Officer Commanding might be justified, more particularly in order to serve as a deterrent to wavering  elements amongst the Government emloyees.  It was agreed that the existing garrison and the rein- forceinents in sight would be insufficient to allow for the earmarking of two weak battalions to replace Government employees,  and it was considered that it would be undesirable  to employ military personnel for  such purposes,  apart from the fact that suitably qualified men are not available.     In the event  of  any considerable  and  determined  refusal  of Government employees to perform their duties it would appear to be necessary for essential services, such as railways, to  stop until sufficient personnel could be trained to enable a minimum service, to be resumed.  It was  thought unlikely that the Navy would be able to lend personnel for use on land during the coming summer, if disturbances  should break out then, owing to the absence of suitable ships from Palestine waters, and it was suggested that the best course would be  to arrange for selected Jewish personnel  to be trained to carry out the duties required for all essential services.  I have accordingly to request that, after consultation with the General Officer Commanding, you  will submit  to me your recommendations with  regard  to a  plan for the  training of  Jewish personnel to meet such an emergency, and in  particular, I should be glad to receive your views as to the practicability, from the political standpoint, of giving effect to such  a training plan, as a  precaution,  before  the  actual  occurrence  of  an  emergency.  The observations already made with regard to the need for discretion in the training of Jewish personnel for  the protection ,of railways,  &amp;c,  would apply equally to this training. fiii)  Certain points regarding the Trans-Jordan Frontier Force in respect of the    period prior to the delegation of powers to the General Officer Commanding    also came under discussion. (a) Recruitment of Jews for the Frontier Force.    It was agreed that decision as to the composition of the Force must rest with the High Commissioner.  It  would,  however, be open  to the General  Officer Commanding, in  the  event of his  disagreeing with the decision of the High Commissioner, to make  representations  to  the War Office if he thought  that military requirements warranted his doing so, and in that event the matter would receive further consideration from His Majesty&apos;s Government. (b) Employment of Trans-Jordan Frontier Force  in Palestine.    The High Commissioner would consult the General  Officer Commanding as to where and for what purposes the Force should be employed.  If  there should be divergence of opinion between the High Commissioner and the  General Officer Commanding, the  decision would rest with  the High Commissioner.   But the General Officer Commanding could, if he thought fit, make representations to the War Office; meanwhile he would comply with the High Commissioner^ decision.    5.  I enclose an extra copy of this despatch for transmission to the GeneralOfficer Commanding.                                   I have  the honour to be,                                             Sir,                                          Your most obedient,                                                humble servant,                                                    W.
