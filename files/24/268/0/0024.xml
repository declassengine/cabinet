Copy No,   CABINET&apos;SOUTH WEST AFRICA        MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE                FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS          My colleagues may be interested to read theattached declaration by His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnion of South Africa of their attitude towards certain questions connected with the mandated territory of SouthWest Africa (Appendix I), and a despatch from the UnitedKingdom High Commissioner in the Union (Appendix II) comment on the salient features.of the declaration.          The declaration was issued by the Union government after their consideration of the recommendations of aCommission of Enquiry which reported in March, 1936, on thesituation in South West Africa.   The Commission was set upin view of the dissatisfaction felt by the white populationof the territory with the existing form of Government,    Thewhite population, which in 1936 numbered 31,600, is dividedinto two mutually hostile sections, the one of British andBoer descent numbering about 19,600 or 60$, and the other ofGerman descent comprising the remaining 40$.   The greatmajority of the inhabitants of German descent, however,became Union nationals by virtue of legislation passed inconsequence of an agreement between the Governments of  theUnion and Germany in 19 23.                                              Representative
          Representative Government was granted to theterritory in 1925, and there is a Legislative Assembly of18 Members,  12 elected and 6 nominated by the Administrator,which is vested with power to make ordinances for theterritory except on certain reserved subjects which includenative affairs, immigration and the Customs tariff.   For someyears the system appeared to work fairly well, the complaints,such as they were, of the elected Members being for the mostpart on a par with those of the European element in any similar Colonial dependency.   The German section neverthelessfelt it a grievance that German was not recognised as one ofthe official languages of the territory,  but the two sectionshad developed such a readiness to co-operate that at the 1932Conference in Cape Town mentioned in the Declaration,, theyboth agreed to petition the Union Government to approve thenecessary legislation to recognise German and automaticallyto naturalize  all Europeans domiciled in the territory on31st December, 1931,,   The Union Government welcomed theagreement, and the situation was such that General Hertzoginformed the Union House of Assembly that &quot;there cannot bethe least doubt&apos; in my mind - and I repeated it recently to thedeputation that came here - as to what the ultimatedestination of South West Africa will be;  that South Africawill ultimately come into close association with South WestAfrica is as certain to my mind as the fact that South WestAfrica forms a portion of South Africa.&quot;          The situation was radically changed by the advent of the National Socialist Party to power in Germany.   In                                                     the
the words of the Commission1s report  &quot;In July,  1933,  acertain Dr. Brerner arrived from Germany,  armed  with powersand funds for the Nazification of all German institutions  inthe country.   All organisations, social,  cultural, politicaland educational, of which the human material was  mainlynaturalised Union subjects, were d.ragooned into this  Nazicomplex.   The schools became nurseries for the cultivation of Nazi recruits.   provocative processions were  organised,the Union flag was hauled down from Government  buildings and the German flag substituted.   Literature was widelydisseminated among the population making propaganda for thereturn of South West Africa to Germany&quot;.    Oaths  of allegiance to Herr Hitler were exacted and &quot;from  the  formsof oath or pledge placed before us it is plain  that Unionnationals were induced to enter into  these formal acts.   Tous this seems incompatible with their obligations as  citizens of the Union&quot;.   Such proceedings roused the Union sectionof the population to opposition, and  the situation became  such that both the Union and German sections petitioned the  UnionGovernment not to- implement the agreement reached at  Cape  Town.In the words of the Commission, a situation developed inwhich the two parties were divided &quot;not by issues which touchthe daily lives of the European inhabitants&quot; but  by questions&quot;of high politics beyond the  competence of the  legislature&quot;,          In these circumstances the  British and  Boerinhabitants decided that the  only hope for the  ameliorationof the political and economic condition of the  territorylay in the incorporation of South West Africa in  the  Unionof South Africa as a fifth province.    The elections  to the                                            Legislative
Legislative Assembly, in 1934  were  fought  on these lines,and the &quot;Union&quot;  party secured 9  out  of  the 12  elective  seatsand proceeded to send a delegation from the Assembly toCape Town to petition the Union  Government for the incorporation of the territory within the Union.    The  UnionGovernment then  appointed the Commission  of Enquiry toreport on the situation.          The Commissioners reported as follows:-&quot;We find that there has been continual interference from theAuslands-Organisation in the  affairs of the territory and that,as a result, freedom of speech,  of political  association,and even of personal conduct  has ceased to exist in theterritory for a  large number  of  Germans who are Union subjects and who are entitled to the protection of the   Mandatoryagainst such infringements of their rights.          The smooth functioning of the Mandate Systemoeconies practically impossible if  such interference in  the affairs of a mandated territory  continues&quot;.    The Commissiontherefore concluded that &quot;the present form of  Government ...is a failure and should be abolished&quot;,  but apart fromagreeing that &quot;there is no legal obstacle to  the governmentof the territory as a province of  the Union  subject to  theMandate&quot;, they failed to agree as  to the  form of Governmentwhich should supersede it.   The Chairman visualised whatwould amount to  the creation of  a fifth province of theUnion on the ground that the Union Government  is better ablethan any local administration to prevent  foreign interferenceand to carry out its obligations to the natives.    One  of the                                           remaining
remaining two members was inclined to  agree but thought thateducation was too important in the circumstances  to  be allocated to a provincial legislature,  but the  other was opposed onthe ground that the political differences  of  the  two sectionsof the European population were too deep-seated forrepresentative institutions to be successful.          During the interval between  the  receipt by theGovernment of the Commission&apos;s report  and  the publicationof the present declaration (March - December, 1936)  thesituation became more difficult owing  to the  effect  on local opinion of the increasing demands in Germany  for  the return of her former Colonies,  and the frequent prediction  of &quot;the imminent termination of  the position of the Union asmandatory&quot; is given at the beginning of the declaration as one of the chief reasons for its issue,          It will be seen that in the  declaration the UnionGovernment -     (1)  does not intend to change the present system of          government in the territory;     (2)  does not consider that to administer the territory          as a fifth province of the Union subject to the          terms of the Mandate would &quot;oe in conflict  with          those terms;     (3)  feels bound again to state publicly and definitely          how it regards the relationship  between the Union          and South West Africa.   The Mandate has been          conferred on the Union irrevocably  under a solemn          treaty, and the Union-cannot legitimately  be                                                 deprived
     deprived of  the  territory against its wish.     The Union Government  is not prepared to consider     the possibility  of the transfer of the Mandate     to another power and.  wishes to assure the people     of South West Africa  that it has as little thought     of abandoning the Mandate as it has of abandoning     its own  territory5(4)   has decided  to render it impossible for aliens to     become or to be members of political organisations     or of such public bodies and other organisations     in regard to which the Administrator considers     it undesirable that aliens should be members;(5)   does not recognise the validity of any claim to     double nationality within the territory and sees     no reason to amend the Naturalisation Act, and(6)   is not prepared to recognise German as an official     language in  South West Africa until this is     desired  by the population of South West Africa.                          (Intd.)  Mo MoDominions Office,     26th February,  1937.
APPENDIX I.218          DECLARATION ON THE ADMINISTRATION  OP  .          _^__SOUTH WEST AFRICA_____     A.   FORM OP  ADMINISTRATION AND CHARACTER OP MANDATE.          The Union Government, having considered  the  reportof the Commission on the Constitution of South Y/est Africa  andhaving taken note of the representations made by the severaldelegations from  the Mandated Territory, has come  to theconclusion that the dissatisfaction with the existing  form  ofgovernment is due to the fact that it has been  judged  not somuch on its merits as a form of administration for thecountry,  but rather as a means of promoting  the divergentideals harboured  by the different sections of the  populationabout the future  of the Territory,          The Union Government regret to have to  state thatthe question of the future of the Territory  is  agitating  the minds of the white population to such an extent,  that  itdominates the political situation, that it threatens to retardthe economic development of the Territory and poisons  therelations between the two main elements of the whiteinhabitants.   The imminent termination of the position of  theUnion as Mandatory isfrequently predicted, for the purpose  of creating a sense  of insecurity in the minds  of the Unionsection of the population.   This has led, on their part,to the wish to seek greater security by closer  administrativeassociation with the Union.   The Union Government fullyrealises the difficult position in which the Union sectionfind themselves and has given its earnest considerationto the desire expressed by them to be reassured on this point.                                                 Although
          Although the Union Government is of the opinion thatto administer the Mandated Territory as a fifth Province of theUnion,  subject to the terms of the Mandate,  would not be in conflict with the terms of the Mandate itself,  it feels that sufficient grounds have not been adduced for taking auch astep.   It is, moreover, not convinced that  the existing formof administration does not answer its purpose,  or that theadministration of the Territory as a Province of the union would contribute materially to that greater  measure of security which the Union section desire.   The Union Government alsovery much doubts whether any of the other solutions whichhave been suggested would give greater satisfaction than theexisting form of administration.          In order, however, to allay, in so far as this lieswithin its power, the sense of insecurity about the future theUnion Government feels bound again to state  publicly anddefinitely how it regards the relationship between the union and South West Africa.   The Mandate has been conferred on theUnion irrevocably under a solemn treaty and the Union cannotlegitimately be deprived of the Territory against its wish.The Union Government  is not prepared to consider thepossibility of the transfer of the Mandate to another power,and wishes to assure the people of South West Africa that ithas as little thought of abandoning the mandate as it has of abandoning its own territory.   No one  need, therefore, beperturbed by the statements of persons who,  for political reasons, make play of the imminent return of the territory to Germany.
          B.  ATTITUDE OF THE GERMAN ELEMENT.          In 1923 the German Government  freely r ecognised that;!fthe future of South West Africa is now  bound  up with the union and that it wouid be a-wise policy for the German nationals  inthat Territory to throw in their lot with South  Africans&quot;.    Inconsequence the German Government undertook to induce theseGerman nationals to become nationals of  the Union.   Actingupon the assumption that this would heppea, the  Union Governmentpromised certain rights and privileges to Germans in SouthWest Africa.   A large number of Germans have, in fact,  becomeUnion nationals in conformity with that  Agreement.          The Union Government has given effect  to its promises,and was therefore entitled to expect that the  persons of Germanorigin who became nationals of the Union in the  spirit intendedby their own Government, would acquiesce in the  idea that thefuture of South West Africa was bound up with  the Union, and thatthey would throw in their lot with the South Africans.  In Yiewof the events of the recent past, however, it  was realised thatthe process of assimilation would take time.  The positionimproved gradually and in the beginning  of 1932  the feeling  thatit was desirable, yea, even necessary to co-operate in a friendlyspirit culminated in the so-called Capetown Agreement.Unfortunately the good understanding created thereby was of short duration.  Mistakes, apparently, on one  side led tomlstatces on the other, with the result that in a short time  theposition developed so unfavourably that, in 1933, both sectionsof the population unanimously asked the  Union  Government,through their representatives who openly proclaimed their mutual distrust, not to give effect to the basis  agreed upon                                                   the
the year before until it  bad given  a decision  as  to  the rightsand wrongs of the mutual  reproaches and recriminations.          In view of the  state of  excitement existing in  theTerritory and the difficulty of forming a correct judgement in such a dispute the Union Government  found it impossible  togive effect to this desire,  in the  hope that gradually common-sense and good reason would prevail.   Unfortunately,  however,especially as a result of the spread amongst a part  of theGerman section of ideas and a philosophy of life  which renderedrapprochement between the two parties even more difficult,  theposition became aggravated.    To its regret the Union Governmentis bound to place on record that it has been brought under  theimpression that a considerable part of  the German section of  thepopulation, whether Union nationals or  not, is, either byconviction or through moral pressure, intimidation,  orinfringements upon the liberty of the individual, grouped in aseparate political organisation, in which those who  wish touse it as a means of creating and maintaining a state of  affairsfavourable to a return of the Territory to Germany hold  s^ay.The right of free speech has almost ceased to exist  amongstthe German population and every member  of the organisation is bound to fall into line with the hints  or orders of the  headof the organisation, on pain of material or moral injury.  the root principles of the organisation to  which each member  mustsubscribe are thus in direct conflict with the democratic principles on which the participation of the population  in theadministration of the Mandated Territory rests,  persons who  arenot Union nationals, and who do not wish to become such,  have apreponderant  influence in shaping the policy of the organisation.                                                   As
9 9 his i*  ,          As a proof of how far this organisation is preparedto go,  it may be pointed out that the present Leader of the&apos;Deutsche Bund7, the pol.i.tj.cal organisation of the Germans inSouth West Africa, is not  only an alien enjoying no political rights within the Territory, but also owes, as member of the&quot;N.S.D.A.P o&quot;, unconditional obedience to the Head of a foreign state.    The members of the TDeutsche Bund&apos;, again, owe to theirLeader, implicit obedience.   Union nationals, therefore, are boundto exercise political rights,  accorded to them as Unionnationals, in conformity with the instructions of an alien, whohimself has no such rights and, moreover, owes implicitobedience to the Head of a foreign state I          Every one will readily realize that this is an impossible position and that,  in this way, an attitate is beingfostered in the minds of nationals of the Union of Germandescent, which may have very serious consequences for theUnion as mandatory.          Furthermore, the doctrine is generally preached thatthe Germans who have become Union nationals under the automaticnaturalisation are entitled to their full German nationalitywithin the Territory.   This attitude is not only devoid of any-legal justification but is also directly in conflict with thespirit and letter of the London Agreement of 1923 and the prs-visions of the naturalisation Act of 1924.  Whatever excuses maybe adduced to explain this,  every unbiased person will be boundto admit that this state of affairs is not conducive to a goodunderstanding between the different elements of the populationor to the maintenance of the authority of the Mandatory.                                                       The
          The Union Government takes this opportunity of  openlydeclaring that it has no objection whatsoever to endeavours onthe part of the German-speaking section of the Union nationalsto maintain their language and cultural life and te establish,for this purpose, their own societies and organisations.   It is,however, of the opinion that it is possible to do this, withoutfostering, in ah illegitimate manner, a spirit of disloyalty tothe Union as Mandatory and without disregarding  and violatingthe fundamental principles upon which the form of administration in the Mandated Territory rests.   The Union Government has,therefore, d. eoided to render it impossible for aliens to  becmme,or to be,members of political organisations, or  of such public bodies and other organisations in regard to which the administrator considers it undesirable that aliens should be members..  In this connection the Government hopes that Unionnationals of German descent will be prepared to  frame theirorganisations on a basis which is more in consonance with theprinciples to which they owe their share in the  administrationof the country.            The Union Government cannot tolerate any unlawfulinfringement upon the liberty of the person and is determined to protect the individual against unlawful pressure orcompulsion, in the exercise of his public or private rights.The necessary legislative measures will be taken to that  end.          The Government also does not recognise the validity ofany claim to double nationality within the Territory.  this claim has no foundation, either in law or in fact.   Persons whshave been naturalised as Union nationals are, in the Mandated                                                  Territory
Territory,  exclusively Union nationals,  as the  Prime  Ministerand General Smuts declared in 1924.    Every claim,  demand orexcuse, vis-a-vis the Mandatory,  based on German nationality isunjustified and founded on untenable grounds.    The UnionGovernment  demands the full and undivided loyalty of  its nationals and will be bound to take  all available measures against acts which are incompatible  with such loyalty.          The Union Government has given its earnestconsideration to the recommendation  of the Commission torecognise German as an official language.   Already in 1932 theUnion Government indicated that it was prepared to introduce inthe Union parliament supplementary legislation which might berequired to give full effect to an Ordinance of the LegislativeAssembly of the Mandated Territory recognising German as anofficial language in South West,    This attitude has  not changed.However, tho Union Government is not prepared to bring any pressure to bear on the population of South West Africa inthis matter and can only express the hope that, as a resultof greater mutual goodwill and improved understanding,  to which&apos;both sections would make the necessary contributions, thetime will arrive when this matter would find its solution.          The Union Government has also considered the wish ofthe German Section that the law on the naturalisation of aliensbe amended ley reducing to two years  the period of residence inthe Territory required by law.   At  present there are manyaliens, consisting almost exclusively of Germans, in theTerritory who pessess the necessary  residential qualifications for naturalisation and -who could thus, if they so desired, be                                               naturalised
naturalised,  but nho are not prepared to  make  use  of  this right..   As long as this attitude persists the Union  government does not see  the desirability or  the necessity of  an  amendment to the Naturalisation Act.          The Union Government has also considered the question in what manner the finances of the Territory can be placed on a sound basis in order to enable the people of the Territory to balance the budget without  having regularly to approach theUnion for loans to cover deficits.   There is  every reason to suppose that  a way will be  found to attain this.          The Union Government trusts that the measuresindicated above will be sufficient and effective and  that  itwill not be forced to take  recourse to further steps.          Inasmuch as no p^rt of  the population has,  up to now, been called upon, or is expected, in the future,  to relinquish any spiritual asset which is essential  to  its existence as a separate cultural group of the population,  theGovernment would finally appeal to all sections of thepopulation of the Territory to feive their earnest  considerationto the matters in regard to which they have received  a share in the government of the Territory, to co-opex^ate, in a spirit of devotion to the interests of the whole poi^ulation,in promoting the welfare of the Territory and to abstain from propagating ideas as to the abolition of  the  mandate,in whatever direction.
APPENDIX IISOUTH AFRICA.OFFICE OF THE HIGH COMMISSIONER    FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM,DOMINIONS.CAPE TOWN.HO.  13.14th January, 1937.I have the honour to inform you that theSecretary for External Affairs sent to my Office, undercover of a letter dated 11th December, 1936, threecopies of a declaration which he described in hiscovering letter as &quot;defining the attitude of the UnionGovernment towards certain questions connected with theadministration of South-West Africa&quot;.     2.    Two copies of the declaration are transmitted to you herewith and three further copies are enclosedin the form of extracts from the South African press,to which the declaration was issued on the 11th December.     3.    There are, as I see it, three salient featuresin this declaration.   These are:-     (a;  The Union Government do not intend, despite therecommendation of the South-vJest Africa Commission, to change the &apos;present system of Government in the Territory.     (b)  The Union Grovernment have declared in roundterms that they are not prepared to consider thepossibility of handing over the mandate to any othercountryTHiS RIGHT HONOURABLE   MALCOLM MACDONALD, M.P. ,       etc.,      etc. jDOMINIONS OFFICE.etc.
 country, and have accordingly adopted a very firm tone vis-a-vis of the German section of trie -population, expressing their determination to put an end to unlawful Nazi political activities and to protect the individual against unlawful pressure or compulsion in the exercise of his public or private rights.      (c)  The union Government have been either unwilling or unable to  announce any decisions  on  the large number of other  questions of policy with which the report of the  South-West Africa Commission dealt.      U.    In regard to  (a),  it  will be  recalled - see Mr.  Antrobus&apos;  despatch  No.  263  of the  18th of  June  last that the members  of the Commission appointed by the Government to consider  the  whole  problem of  the adminis- tration  of the  territory were unanimous  in condemning the  present  system of government  as &quot;a  failure&quot;, but that the three  Commissisners  were  unable  to agree on any  alternative proposals  and produced  three widely differing   schemes  as their  respective  recommends.tions for  a more  suitable system  of government.   If  the Government had had  leanings  towards  some  drastic change in  the system of administration,  this circumstance  would certainly have placed them in a difficulty, but I should not  be surprised if actually  it has  come  to them as something  cf  a relief.   It  certainly affords a good excuse for leaving  things as  they are, and in the present  state of unrest in the Territory, as a result ofwhich no proposal would be likely tc secure general acceptance, one can sympathise with Ministers in preferring to follow the line of least resistance.   One can also sympathise with their reluctance te admit the                                                failure &apos;
failure  of the liberal regime granted to the Territory  **&amp;0 &apos;in  1925.   The adoption, for example, of the schemeevolved  by Mr. Justice van den Heever, for which, I think,of  the three put forward by the Commission the strongestcase has been made out, would mean a reversion from represen-tative government which would certainly be widely condemned -and not  only in the Territory itself - as an unjustifiablyretrograde step.   The same criticism would have beenmade, though in lesser degree, had either of the other proposals been adopted, for all three Commissioners were agreed that there was no chance of repairing the troubleby way of the grant of wider rights.    It may well be,therefore, that the Government have acted prudently inrejecting any proposals for a change;  and I think there issubstance in their contention that the troubles of theTerritory have been caused less by defects in the existing system of government than by political conditions, and inparticularof course, by the behaviour of the German section.This latter evil the Government hope  to remedy by givingthe German element a severe jolt.     5.    This brings me to my point  (b)  above, for a-firstjolt has, in fact been administered;   the Declarationexpresses in commend ably firm, terms condemnation of thesubversive political activities of the German section andis emphatic that the mandatory will no longer countenance them.     6.    It will be recalled that the Commission were unanimous in drawing attention to the danger to the Territory,both from the political and from the  economic point of view,of leaving the inhabitants in any uncertainty as to theretention by the Union of the mandate.    The declaration that the Union is not prepared to consider  the transfer ofthe mandate to another povtrer is bound in  itself to be                                                reassuring
reassuring to the South  african element in theTerritory:  and if this pronouncement is followed up,as  indicated in the Declaration, by vigorous actionagainst the spread of German propaganda, thus proving that the Union Government have no intention of allowing Nazi activity to flourish, it may be that some improvement will be attained.   I cannot, however,pretend to feel very c onfident about it.   It hardlyseems likely, if one may judge by the activities ofHitlerian Germany in other parts of the world, thatthe Germans in South-V/est Africa will become muchmore amenable than they have been in the past, and ifthey continue to make trouble, one has some doubtswhether, when it comes to the point, the Governmentwill be quite so firm with them as -they now indicate.The Department of External Affairs will certainly verymuch dislike anything which may lead to friction withthe Government of a foreign country.   Nor does thepast record of the Union section suggest that they willhe prepared to temper the jubilation they must feel atthe rap administered to German knuckles with sufficientsympathy to induce in the Germans any feeling of sv^eetreasonableness.    The Government Declaration itself iseminently sympathetic to German cultural aspirationsand expresses willingness to have German recognised asa third official language in the Territory:   but theGermans themselves must be sufficiently forthcomingto succeed in persuading the majority to move for suchaction.&apos;   Both in this matter and in their ruling on theGerman  request for easier facilities for naturalisationthe Declaration scores neatly at the expense of theGerman element.     7.    With regard to point (c)  in the third paragraphof this despatch, I do not propose to do more than to                                                 draw
draw your  attention to  two  important matters in regardto which the Declaration  is  entirely unhelpful.   Inregard  to  finance, it makes  the following crypticobservation:    &quot;There is every reason to  suppose that away will be found to attain&quot; the; placing of the finances of the  Territory on a sound  basis.   This elusivenessis rather  naive and, of course, quite unconvincing.The latest figures both for  imports and  exportscertainly  show improvement,  but I see no reason to doubt the  correctness of  the view expressed by thethree Commissioners that  &quot;there seems to be little prospect of the Territory securing a sound financialposition&quot;, unless some altogether unforeseeable develop-ment takes place.   I cannot believe that this baldstatement will satisfy the Mandates sub-Committee atGeneva, by whom the Declaration will, in due course,be considered (cf.  the statement of the Union delegatein the Committee&apos;s report to the Assembly dated the8th October last).    It will be interesting to see whatthe union Government spokesman will have to say ifcross-questioned on the point.     8.    The second omission to which, I do not doubt,&apos;the Mandates sub-Committee will also devote attention,is the very grave one that nowhere in their Declarationdo the Union Government mention the natives to whom,under the mandate,  they are placed in the relation of trustees.    Mr.  Antrobus drew your attention,  in thedespatch to which I have already referred,  to  the  factthat the members of the Commission,  with the partialexception of Mr.  Justice van den Heever,  also  sho?/ed atendency te evade this issue and to  consider theirproblem purely from the point of view of the smallEuropean population of the Territory.    The Declaration                                                   goes
