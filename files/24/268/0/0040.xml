SPANISH MOROCCO.(Previous Paper  No. C.O.S. 559.)                                 REPORT.    WE have been asked (Cabinet 5 (37)) to re-examine the question of spanish morocco in relation to the Civil War in Spain, and the possible consequences thatmight arise therefrom.    It has been suggested that if the  Government forces were victorious;, theSpanish Government would  not wish  to  retain  the Colony, and  that  if the insurgents were victorious, questions of concessions  to  certain. Powers vwouldprobably arise. The extension of the neutral zone at Tangier  to include spanish morocco has  been suggested tentatively as a possible  solution,          .:?    .r.;;.    2.   For  many years our  policy, has been based on  the  principle that for strategic reasons the African  coast of the  Straits of Gibraltar should not  come under the control of any major Power.    The control of Spanish Morocco was  the subject of papers  by the  Chiefsof Staff in 1925* and  in 1931, t  and we referred to it in a  paper  prepared inAugust 19364 Consequently our reasons for  considering that our policy shouldcontinue to be based on this&apos; principle need only  be stated very shortly.    3.   A major Power in possession of  Spanish Morocco would be able toconstruct batteries  which  would  bring  our  dockyard  at  Gibraltar  withinbombardment range  of  her guns.  She would have possession of naval bases inclose proximity to Gibraltar, which would  thus  be exposed to the risk of attackon a more formidable scale than at present.  Her air forces would constitute anincreased air menace  to Gibraltar,  and her  naval and air  forces  would  addmaterially to the threat to our. shipping passing  through the Straits, although in the case of France,  who already holds  air and naval bases in Morocco  andAlgeria, the  slight reduction  in  range would not make any serious difference to the  scale of her  air  attack.  Finally, she would, in war,  be in a position to seize the International  Zone at Tangier and  use it as an additional  base.    4.  Whenever  a change  of  status in Spanish  Morocco has  been underdiscussion, the possibility of  placing  restrictions by international  agreement upon the military activities Of any Power which might occupy the area has beenconsidered.   The Power in question might be denied  the right to fortify either the Spanish  Zone or the Presidios, and restrictions might be placed upon thestrength of the military forces to be maintained in peace.   Such restrictions                          * C.I.D. 554-B, 555-B, 556-B.                          f CO.8. 279.                          $ CCS. 509.       [14778]
 would  be ineffective; because even; if  they  were effective&apos; in, peace,.&apos;they would only modify  arid not destroy the strategic advantages conferred by possession of the  Spanish territory.     5.   Our  strategic position  is already being affected by political and military changes -in the Mediterranean,  particularly by the  rise of Italy and the develop- ment of aircraft.  While the ultimate effect of these changes remains uncertain it is more than ever important that we  should not accept the weakening of our position, which the foregoing considerations show would follow a departure from our policy in regard to  Spanish Morocco.     6.   Strategically we should  clearly be strongest  if  we ourselves controlled Spanish Morocco,  We should  hold a position from which we could control the Straits, even  in the  face of a strong and hostile Spain.  The ability to develop air bases in northern Africa would also enable us  to overcome the difficulties  at present imposed upon us with regard to  an aerodrome at  Gibraltar.     7.   If we dismiss this improbable development, however, our interests would be best served by the continuation of Spanish control in Morocco,  whether Spain emerges strong or weak&apos;from her  present troubles.  Our security  at  Gibraltar would be prejudiced only if Spain were hostile and, in that event, a, strong hostile&quot;Spain could interfere with our operations from Gibraltar and with shipping  in the Straits, even more easily from the European mainland than from the African coast.     8.   Theoretically, from the strictly strategical  point  of view, our security  at Gibraltar and  in the Straits would be  served  as  well by  the extension of the International Zone to include Spanish Morocco as by the  continuance, of Spanish control.  The experience  gained  at Tangier  indicates, however,  that: an inter- hatiorial regime would be  liable  to be a source of endless  friction, and even a possible cause of a conflict. -  rk 9.  Any  other solution would  give  a major Power  control of the African shore and would be an abandonment of the principle which we hold to be essential. A  long view  must be taken of this question and we ai^e, therefore, reluctant  to compare the disadvantages of French, German or Italian control, regarding them each alike, in  the long run, as a potential threat to British interests.
