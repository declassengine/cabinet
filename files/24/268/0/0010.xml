THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  February 1937.SECRET.G.P. 60 (37).CABINET.CALEDONIAN  POWER  ORDER,  1937.    PRODUCTION  OF  CALCIUM  CARBIDE.             Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland.    THE Memorandum on this  subject by the Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence,  CP.  55  (37),  raises important issues.   The Minister  reaches  theconclusion that, from the defence point of view, the Caledonian Power Schemeought on  merits to be supported  (page 7, at foot).   He suggests, however, thatthe Cabinet may take the view,  on wider political  grounds, that the question should be left to  a  free  vote of  the  House, Government  spokesmen  merelypresenting the case.    2.  The Minister is, however, of opinion that the Second Reading of the bill would in such circumstances be defeated by a &quot; combination of opposing groups,&quot;although,  under Private Bill procedure,  the Second  Reading is in essence onlypermission for subsequent examination by a Select Committee of the House.    3.  The &quot; groups &quot; include those  interested in Highland amenities, sportinginterests, and the needs of the Distressed and Special Areas.  It is specially withregard to the last of these that I am concerned.   It would be a mistake to suppose that the introduction of new industries  is of vital importance only to the areasscheduled in the Special Areas Act,  1934.   The getting of new industries isequally important to the Highlands, which have suffered a great decline in someof their few industries  (e.g., herring  fishing, kelp making),  and in which theunemployment  index  is very high.  Sir  Thomas Inskip&apos;s Memorandum gives(paragraph 9 (v)) percentages in  certain  areas in November 1936. Even for the twelve months  period of 1936 the argument is not substantially weakened, theaverages being  47-2 per  cent, in Ross and Cromarty, 21-6 per cent, in Inverness-shire, and 37-3 per cent, in Caithness and Sutherland, compared with 34-9 per cent.in Glamorganshire.    4.  In respect of heavy and prolonged unemployment, and lack of strength to tackle this from unaided  local  resources, the Highlands and Islands are fullyqualified to be treated as part of  the  Special Areas.   Indeed, as the minister&apos;s memorandum CP.  55 (37) says :  &quot; The reason  for not including the Highlandsin the Special Areas scheduled under the Special Areas Act is not the degree ofUnemployment, but the  difficulty of applying the machinery of  that Act to this district.&quot;  A Resolution calling upon  the Government to formulate withoutdelay proposals designed to arrest depopulation and poverty in the highlands and  Islands  was  unanimously adopted  by  the  House of  Commons  on  the16th December, 1936.    5.  Looking to these  facts, the Highlands have as  strong  a claim for  theestablishment of this new carbide  industry, on the ground of need  for  new industries, as South Wales,  Lanarkshire, or any of the  scheduled  &quot; SpecialAreas.&quot;   Moreover, the British Oxygen  Company have  selected the site of  theproposed  factory and  other  works in  Inverness-shire  and Ross-shire as  theappropriate location for this industry as a practical commercial proposition.

    6.  The Government position was stated  in strong terms in the Debate onthe 18th March, 1936, to be in favour of the Second Reading (with the hope thatsqme  blemishes, which have been largely  dealt with in the Bill now proposed,would be  removed).  If, after these  modifications, which are all along the lines indicated  by the Government spokesmen,  Government support were now to be withheld,  the areas which hope to benefit  from the employment,  &amp;c, to be givenby this scheme, would look for reasons for this change of front.   It would haveto be  stated, then or later, that hot only was the new industry to be set up in an area where unemployment was no greater than in the Highlands, but that thiswould require the equivalent of a substantial subsidy (estimated at over  100,000a year in  Appendix A, p. 10, of CP. 55  (37) ).  There is no doubt that under such circumstances the Highland areas in question would feel a strong grievance,and that they would ask for an equivalent assistance at some early date.    7.  In the foregoing remarks I have dealt with the alternatives of productionof carbide and ferro alloys in  (i) the Highlands, (ii) South Wales  or other  SpecialAreas.  It is to be noted, however, that, while the  Caledonian Scheme is  a fullyexamined  proposal which a strong and experienced Company are prepared  to back and carry out, the alternative schemes which have been mooted for South Wales,or the South of Scotland, are all in the theoretical stage, and,  as Sir  ThomasInskip points out, they are based on the principle that  the Government takes  allthe risks.    8.  In these circumstances,  I would  ask  my  colleagues to  agree that theGovernment  should give  the fullest support  to  the  Second Reading  of  theCaledonian Power Bill.                                            .  (Initialled)       W. E. E.    Scottish Office, Whitehall, S.W. 1,           February 11, 1937.
