Memorandum by the Lord President of the  Council.     At its Meeting on Monday,  15th Eebruary,  the coronation Committee of the Privy Council had under con-sideration the question of the price to be charged forseats in Government stands on the Coronation route.     The principle which had all along been in the minds ofthe Committee was that no charge should fall on public funds in respect of the cost of erecting the stands.    Butit has now become clear that the seats, even at bare cost price? i.e. about 50/-? will be beyond the capacity of .large sections of the community.     The Committee was deeply impressed with thedesirability of securing that no difficulties as to priceshould prevent a fully representative attendance of allclasses of the com unity on the Government stands.    Atthe same time, after examination of the whole question,both by the Coronation Committee itself and the CoronationExecutive Committee, no satisfactory plan has been evolved to solve the problem on the basis of differentialprices or otherwise,     The Committee in these circumstances unanimouslypassed the following resolution:       &quot;That, after careful consideration of all possible             methods of discrimination in matter of price             between classes and individuals,  the Coronation                       -1-
             Committee has satisfied itself that no             satisfactory scheme of discrimination is             possible.        The Committee believes that a charge of 15/- a             seat would not exclude any of those whose             attendance is desired in a representative             capacity.        The Committee therefore advises that a charge be             made of 15/- per seat and that the remaining             cost be borne by the Exchequer, !&apos;     This resolution was taken to the Prime Minister andthe Chancellor of the Exchequer the same evening bymyself, accompanied, by Lord. Derby, Sir Austen Chamberlain,Sir Archibald Sinclair and Mr. Attlee, as representingthe Coronation Committee of the Privy Council.   It wasagreed that a note setting out the terms of the resolutionshould be circulated to the Cabinet with a view to its being discussed at the next weekly meeting of the Cabineton Wednesday? 17th February.
