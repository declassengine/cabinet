The Sub-Committee was appointed by fehe main Committee on recruiting for the Army on December 8th, 1936, (R.A.(36) 1stConclusions, page 11).   Its composition was as follows :-

Education.2:.      Our interim Report (R.&apos;A*(36) 6) was circulatedto the main Committee on 7th January, 1937.3*      At the final Meeting of the main Committee, held        jon 13th January, 1937,  it was agreed       &quot;That the Sub-Committee on Government and        Local Authority Employment for Ex-Regulars        should he invited to continue their examina-        tion of the problems of Government employment        for ex-regulars, of the pay, pension and        seniority of ex-regulars in the Civil Service,        and of local authority employment for ex.....        regulars.        On completing their examination the Sub-        Committee should submit a report to the        First Commissioner of Works, who would        lay it before the Cabinet1&apos;,,        (R. AS (36) 3rd Conclusions, page 6).The future -prospects of Government employment forex-regulars.4.      The main question remaining to be examined is thepossibility of providing an increased amount of employmentin the Civil Service, of a kind for which ex-regularsare suitable.                      -2-                     .
       Our inquiries show that the main potentialopenings are in the Post Office and in the industrialstaffs of the Defence Departments,  For suitablemiscellaneous employment in other parts of the CivilService there is, broadly speaking, already virtuallycomplete reservation to ex-service men (i.e.  to ex-hostilities men as well as to  ex-regulars).Although the vacancies so reserved are scattered  overmany Departmentsj  in  the aggregate their  number is substantial.5.     As regards  the future  intake  into  the  CivilService; both industrial and  non-industrial,  it is extremely difficult  to make a satisfactory  estimate.       Taxing first a long-term view,  i. e.  lookingbeyond the next few years, the principal fact  to benoted is one referred to in the following passage ofthe main Co, nlttee &apos; s Report,    &apos;The  &quot;hostilities  only&quot;complication will  solve itself in the  course  of afew years.   There can he few such men who  are nowless than 37 or  38 years of age,  and  in  the nearfuture all  such men will virtually be  above the age-limit for appointment to posts of the  kind  for whichthere is a  normal  reservation to  ex-regulars&apos; (CP.  11  (37) paragraph 20).   The ex-regular isalready getting  an increasingly large  share of the posts to which we  have referred in paragraph  4.Some of these posts, indeed,  are  even now definitelyreserved for ex-regulars, to  the  exclusion of ex-hostilities men.
        In  these circumstances the best estimatewhich we can form points to an intake after  thenext few years of about 5,000 ex-regulars a  year,subject to fairly substantial variation  either wayeIn putting/forward  this figure we have takenaccount of the fact  that anticipated developments in the Post Office may offer a permanent prospectof some few hundred  additional posts annually in  -the course of the next few years.   The  total of5,000 would consist of approximately 2,500 a  year under the Post Office, 1,500 a year in the industrialstaffs of  the Defence Departments, and 1,000 a year in miscellaneous Civil Service employment,6,      On a short-term, view, we forecast a temporaryposition, over the next year or two, which couldbe much more favourable to ex-service men as a whole,io eo  not only to ex-regulars but also to ex-hostilities men, though these would be eligible onlyin a decreasing proportion.   As a result of thepresent Defence Requirements programme,  the  WarOffice and the .A&quot;ir iJinistry anticipate an intakeat the rate of at least 3,000 a year each.   The^ost Office intake is also likely to be in theneighbourhood of 3,000 during this period.   Duringeach of the next two years it may therefore  prove possible to absorb the best part of 10,000 ex-service men of both categories,  subject to two irn-portant considerations :--
30 .i      (a)  that the strong local objection which exists            at present to the employment of non-local            ex-regulars, as against local civilians            desiring the Government employment, can            be overcome;      (b)  that full use is made by Departments and by            the men. them selves of the Employment            Exchanges, which provide the machinery for            linking up the ex-regular in one part of            the country with vacancies in another part;            and that the ex-regular will be prepared tes            move from his existing place of residence.       We think it right to emphasise that unless these considerations,and in particular consideration (a) canbe implemented the number of ex-service men who will secure employment will fall far short of any figure of10?000*       As regards (b) we understand that the national association for Employment of -Regular Sailors, Soldiersand Airmen have an excellent liaison arrangement with the Employment Exchanges,7o     To sum up, it would be possible temporarily toincrease in the intake of ex-service men (both ex-regular and ex-hostilities) during the next two years up to a  .total of approximately 10,000 a year.    There appearsto be no means of permanently increasing the annual intaketo any considerable extent beyond 5,000;   but owing tothe operation of age-limits against ex-hostilities men .the proportion of this total available for ex-regularswill steadily increase up to 100$.
Government employment a  cL.iscrim.inat ion in . favour of men who haverecently completed, their Colour service. 8K.   We turn now to the vexed question of the competing claims for Government employment of the ex-regular of some years standing and the ex-regular recently discharged.   We dealt with this problem, in our first Report,  we approached it with the objectof i /proving the prospects of the latter class, in order to stimulate recruiting.   Our first Report accordingly contained a passage on which the following recommendation of the main committee&apos;s Report was basedj-          &quot;The present congestion in tne waiting-lists for           Government employment will, however, persist for           a much longer period, unless positive action is           taken to discriminate between categories of post-           war ex-regulars.   Ve recommend a measure of           discrimination, in favour of men who have just           completed their Colour service.,   In some cases           the discrimination might take the form of a quota,           under which an increasing proportion of the           vacancies would be reserved for newly discharged           men.   In many cases, however, it will not be           possible to do more than invite Departments to           keep in mind the desirability of providing           employment for ex-regulars within a reasonable           period of their discharge.&quot;   (Report of the           Committee on Recruiting, CP. 11 (37), paragraph           27 (h)).                            &apos;     We have lately been compelled to reconsider our view of thismatter.   The National Association inform us that they are definitely of the opinion that any discrimination in favour ofmen who have recently completed their Colour service, to the  :disadvantage of men some years from their discharge, who arestill on the waiting-list for Government employment, will bebitterly resented.   The fact is that many men who put their names on the Association&apos;s waiting-list look upon any outsideemployment which they may receive as purely temporary and are willing to throw it up to obtain a Government appointment.    Inthe case of Post Office appointments the prospect of pension is&apos;one of the main attractions.     It is impossible, in our opinion,  to ignore  the psychologyof the man in the ranks.    The fact must  be faced that it is the        *                     -6-
303wish of large numbers of men, to whom the Government haveobligations, to enter into Civil Service employment and thatthey are willing, if necessary, to wait for several years inthe hope of. obtaining it. 9o   The difficulty can be overcome to a certain extent byselecting Service tradesmen, and men who have undergone aspecial course of training, for certain technical positions,such for example as the engineering grades in the post Office,In our view there ought to be no difficulty in a Departmentarranging with the Far Office to earmark men in, say., the royal engineers or the Royal Corps of Signals before the expiration of their Colour service.   This limited scheme might soon havea favourable effect on enlistment, since it would quickly become known that men v/ith technical qualifications had an excellentchance of going straight into employment under the Government,immediately on their discharge,10o  The quota plan should not in our view be proceeded with,in the face of the information conveyed by the national association.   The desirability of providing employment, for ex-regulars within a reasonable period of their discharge should however be impressed upon all the Government Departmentsconcerned.Pay of ex-regulars in the Civil Service.11-  In the ordinary way, with the exception of the Pest Office,the Civil Service.grades to which ex-regulars are recruited aregrades to which there is no juvenile entry.   The ex-regularenters an adult grade and receives an adult.&apos; rate or scale of pay.   No special question affecting his pay arises.   In manycases the position is even simpler, i.e. where there is a 100%reservation for ex-regulars.     The scales of pay are reasonablec    Por example, in theindustrial grades,  which are typical cases, ex-regulars recruited
 as labourers in the Post Office Engineering Department are paid on first appointment 49/- in London and 46/- in the Provinces? rising to 53/- and 50/- respectively after three years&apos; service. Unestablished. skilled workmen in the same Department are paid on first appointment not less than 48/6 in Lend on and. 45/6 in the  Provinces, and rise to 70/-- and 67/6 respectively,     Ex.-regular entrants to grades which are also entered by juvenile recruitment receive pay appropriate to their age on entry.   Thus, an ex-regular of 25 or over appointed as a post- man rises from 54/- to 69/- a week in inner London? and even in the most remote rural districts from 45/- to 53/-. Pensions., of ex-regular Civil gervants. 12*   V/e are Unable to support the proposal that Colour service which does not qualify for a Naval, Army or Air Force pension shall reckon towards an ex-regular&apos;s civil pension, in the event of his becoming an established Civil Servant.   The proposal has been considered by successive Governments, and also by the Royal Commission on the Civil Service;  in each case the difficulties in the way of the concession have been found to be insuperable.     In the first place? it would be inequitable to widen the existing gap between ex-regulars who enter the Government service and. ex-regulars who enter private industry.    As we have indi- cated in paragraph 8,  no new attractions are needed to induce the ex-regular to enter Government employment.    It is attractive to him on its present terms,  and he is  prepared to wait  for several years in order to obtain an openings,     In the second place,  the Civil Service  grades normally entered by ex-regulars are in the main unpensionable - with thenotable exception of the Post:. Office.     In the third place?  the  cost would be prohibitive,  running certainly into millionsc    It would be  politically impossible to exclude existing personnel from any concession,
 SeniorityLiof......ex-regulars^In the Civil Service. 2.3&quot;o   No  question  arises  in practice as regards the seniority  of ex-regular  Civil  Servants, except  in the Post Office.   The practice of that  Department is to  regard seniority as a matter affecting the  individual  more than the Department 5   it is  there- fore  fixed  by  the method  most acceptable to the  staff.   we understand  that any Departmental rule determining the seniority of ex-regulars by their age on entry would meet with much opposition  and on the whole we do  not favour the attempt being- made.   The attractions of employment in the Post office are already  sufficient, and no alteration of the seniority system will  provide an increased number of&apos;posts, which is  the first object of our  inquiry. Local Authority employment.14,.    &quot;We  proposed  in our first Report that a circular should be addressed to Local Authorities, impressing upon them the importance  of  an.effective preference for recently discharged ex-regulars 1   and that if possible the circular should be preceded by a  debate on a private Member&apos;s motion in the House of Commons.    These suggestions did not meet with the approval of the main Cabinet Committee.     Ve find it difficult to make further suggestions on this aspect of the  problem.   From time to time, no doubt, cases come before- the  Ministry of Health and.  the Scottish Office, in which it is possible to bring -pressure to bear on an Authority,  in  the direction of providing increased opportunities of employment  for the ex-regular.      In  the main, however, the matter is entirely in the hands of Local Authorities themselves.   We are afraid that they are doing little to make tne Defence Services popular as a career by reserving employment for  ex-regulars.   During 1936  only 1,449 men are on record  as  having obtained municipal employment tnrough the                             -9-
ViNational Association,  whose representatives told us that  fromthe Association&apos;s point of view Municipal Authorities are as ageneral rule the least helpful of employers.     In some cases Regimental Associations have been able tohelp by establishing good personal contacts with Local Authori- -ties o     We have a suggestion to make in connection with the newduty which Local Authorities are about to undertake of organisingadditional fire-fighting services to meet the possibility of air attack.   The intention is that these services shall be staffedalmost entirely by volunteers from the general public,   In somecases, however, there will be a small increase in the number offiremen permanently employed and we recommend that LocalAuthorities be asked to take into consideration the claims of ex-regulars to this employment.      The Homo Office  andthe Scottish Office  should9  we  consider^ be  invitedto bring this matter to the notice of Local Authorities.Police emplcyment,150   The main Committee saw &quot;no adequate reason why the normalmethod of recruitment for the Police should not be principallythrough the Defence Forces&quot; (Report of the Committee on Recruiting,CP.  11 (37),  paragraph 27 (j)).   We understand that the cabinet have reserved a decision on this point,  pending a report by theHome Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland as to howfar this recommendation is feasible.16c   The Sub-Committee1s investigations  show that in the case ofa good many forces Chief Constables would be willing to take moreex-regular entrtints if they could rely on being able to retainreservists in their forces, at any rate  for three months, in theevent of a war involving air attacks, and provided that noextension of Reserve service v/ere permitted to policemen.
     We are glad to report that the War Office can  see their way clear to give an assurance that reservistsemployed as police will not he eligible for extensionof reserve service, and that they will also he ablematerially to increase the number of reservists employed as police who will not be called up before 3 months fromthe outbreak of hostilities.,     Owing to the varyingincidence of employment in different parts of the countryand the different areas concerned? the actual number willfluctuate,  but it is expected to be not less than double the number which obtains at the present time.,17.     The Home Office and the Scottish Office are nowobtaining estimates from the various Police forces  ofthe additional numbers of ex-regular entrants whom theyare likely to take.    We understand that provincialforces can probably absorb an additional intake of from300 to 500 a year,  while the Metropolitan Police can probably take an additional S50 a year,  some of whcmwould be on a short-service engagement.     It must be noted, however,  that between 1940 and1944 there will be practically no Police retirements,owing to Police recruiting having been suspended duringthe war     Every effort will be made by the police authorities to maintain as high, an intake as possiblebetween 194Q and 1944, but it will undoubtedly dropduring those years.18.     The age limit for entry into the Police is oftentoo low to permit of the recruitment of  ex-regulars.It is still fixed at 25 or 26 in many cases.    The Home
 Office  and  the  Scottish  Office  are looking into  this matter,  and. we  wish to emphasise  the  importance  of a satisfactory settlement.   We realise  that it will be hard  to get round  the difficulty  in the  case of  long- service  Police,  who a re  subject to an  age-limit  for retirement,  and who have  to serve 30  years to qualify for a pension on the maximum scale.      It  is  clear that there can be no  question of long- service  ex-regulars joining the Police,  This rules out, for example,  the great majority of Naval personnel.Employment  as physical training instructors.190      We  find that there is no  opening for physical training instructors from the Regular. Forces in  elementary schools.     It  is  now the usual practice to place physical training, like  all other  subjects, in  the hands  of the ordinary teaching  staff of the  school.   It is recognised as desirable  that  a proportion  of the staff should possessspecialised physical training qualifications, in additionto their general qualifications.     In public  schools,  however, which number about  120,and. in private  preparatory schools,  there should be  an opening for ex-regulars who have taken the instructor-leaders&apos; course  at  the Army Physical Training School atAldershot.    We  contemplate that they would organise the physical fitness and games side of the school training under the general  direction of  a member of the schoolstaffc    This  should be  work of high value.    It mightbe that the 500  grant-aided secondary schools would beable to absorb  a certain number of the same type;  thoughmost schools of  this category will prefer, like elementary                          -12-            !
 schools?  to entrust physical training  entirely to the ordinary  teaching staff.     While it  would he contrary to  the policy  of the Board  of Education to endeavour  to influence the  school authorities in regard to the sources from which they recruit  their staff, it would he open  to the war Office to inform the authorities, like any  other potential employers of labour,  of the  existence of  this field of  recruitment,     We have been glad to learn of the Board&apos; of Education&apos;s high opinion of the men  trained at&apos; the Aldershoifc. course. If  the War Office wish to bring these  instructors to  the notice of the  secondary  schools, the Board inform us  that they are  willing to co-operate  in drafting a suitable letter.     Less is known of the products of  the other services with regard to their suitability for giving instruction in physical  training,  but it might be found that they  would be equally suitable as instructor-leaders.     There should also be openings for ex-regular instructor- leaders under  the local  Committees which are to be  set up as a result of the recently inaugurated national campaign for physical training and recreation,     We may add that in  1935 the Board of Education under- toek at the invitation of the Inspector of Physical Training at the War Office to collaborate in connection with the Aldershot course.      Agrcomonto. were made whereby  the Inspectors of  the two Departments jointljr endorse a cert- ificate awarded to the trainee  to the effect that he has followed a course of recreative physical training suitable for instructors of youths and young men in clubs,  centres, and evening classes,,    Forty-si;: Certificates have been endorsed up to dateo
The National. Ass ociatiqno ,20o     In the course of our enquiries under our Terms ofReference certain matters, have come to our notice which havea hearing upon the general problem of finding employment forthe ex-regular in industry.   It may be useful if, we discuss these brief ly at the end of this report        The National Association at present employ 49 job-finders j, who are said to be poorly paid0    The Associationare anxious to be able to offer better pay? increasedtravelling allowances * better accommodation and more clericalhelp,    The conditions which they can offer at present arenot such as to attract the best type of job-finder^   If theyhad more money they could gradually replace such of theirjob-finders as are not entirely suitable with higher gradepersonnel?  and if there were money to spare in addition?they would consider opening new branches and increasing thenumber of job-finderso       To meet the Association&apos;s representations^ a proposalfor an increased, grant to them was brought before the mainCabinet Committee by the Secretary of State for Vvaro   TheCommittee?  however   were unwilling to make- any recommenda-tion and considered that the proposal required discussion by the three Service Departments and the Treasury,       We understand that no approach has yet been made tothe Treasury by the Service Departments;    the/Treasuryview of the proposal cannot accordingly be anticipated.We wish, however,  to put it on record,  subject to the re-servation of the Treasury&apos;s view?  that we are impressed with the National Association&apos;s representations,  and. thatwe hope that it will be found possible for the grant to..be increased,                                 i                           -14-
3DIff1culty^of provirLIng for unskilled men.              31121.     Skilled tradesmen leaving the Services, and mentrained in vocational training centres, have little diffi-culty in finding employment, and at the present time theLTational Association have few such men registered on theirhooks as unemployed.,        On the other hand, ex-regulars from non-technical units, in cases where vocational training has not heenreceived, fall into the unskilled category.    There is a largenumber of such men shown as unemployed on the National Associa-tion&apos;s books;  their placing in work is the Association&apos;s most difficult task.        It must be remembered, however, that in many classesof work it is the normal industrial practice to employ labour on a casual basis.   Although employment of this nature mustbe classed as temporary, the result in practice is that menare in work for a considerable part of the year.    Moreover,since the slump the tendency has been for many large concerns,including the railways, to have a larger &quot;fringe&quot; of temporaryemployees than in the past.The King&apos;s Ro.Ho22o     We are informed that it is becoming difficult to findenough disabled men for firms to maintain the percentagerequired by the conditions of the King&apos;s Roll.  This isparticularly the case in London, and among the smaller firms.The time cannot be far distant when it will no longer bepossible to maintain the Roll in its present form, owing tothe insufficiency of disabled men.        A suggestion has been made that, when this time comes, a new form of Roll should be started, under whichfirms would undertake to employ a minimum percentage of ex-regulars.        We consider that it will be best to take no decision                         -15-   &apos;              &apos; ]
until the King&apos;s Roll in its present form has ceased to operate, owing to natural causes.    One very convincingargument against introducing a new complication is thatGovernment Departments often find a difficulty in placingcontracts owing to the various preferences already inoperation, e. go  the existing Xing&apos;s Roll, the preference onaccount of location in the Distressed Areas and the preferencein respect of the use of Empire products.    It would he un-desirable to superimpose an additional preference.      In these circumstances it is clearly necessary toproceed with caution.   We do not favour any interferencewith the existing policy of the National Association, viz.  to induce employers to realise that it is to their advantage to employ ex-regulars, rather than to adopt the attitude that itis the duty of the employers to do so.  It does not appear tous that further Government action would he useful at present.Summary of conclusions and recommendations.25.    (i)  On a long-term view, i.e-  looking beyond the             next few years, we are unable to find any means             of increasing to any Considerable extent the             annual number of posts in the Civil Service,             for which ex-regulars are eligible, above the&apos;  .             present figure of about 5,000 industrial and             non-industrial posts open to ex-service men             as a whole.    Anticipated developments in             the post Office do, however,  offer a permanent             prospect of some few hundred additional             posts annually in the course of the next few             years.   By then ex-hostilities men will have             ceased to be eligible for the posts in             question, and the net result will bo a consider-             able increase in the intake of ex-regulars.      (ii)  On a short-term view we forecast a temporary             position in the Government service which could             be made distinctly more favourable to the             employment of ex-service  men (i.e.  ex-regulars             and ex-hostilities men taken together).   This             arises mainly from the increased work created &apos; &apos;  -             by the Defence Requirements programme.    It             should be possible during the next two years             to absorb up to 10,000 ex-service men a year,             provided always that  there.is no obstacle,
          owing to local opposition or  other  causes,          to the free movement of  the ex-regulars  whom&apos;          it is hoped to employ to the  part  of  the          country in which the Government  employment          is available. (ill)   We have found it necessary to abandon our          previous proposal of a quota, under which          an increasing proportion of Government          vacancies would be reserved for  newly discharged          ex-regulars.   We endorse, however,  our re-          coinmencation that the desirability of pro-          viding employment for ex-regulars  within a          reasonable period of their discharge  should          be impressed upon all the Government  Depart-          ments concerned-..  (iv)   We recommend that,  as an exception to our          recommendation at (iii), tradesmen, and  men          with technical qualifications, should, where          practicable,  be earmarked before the  ex-          pi rat ion of their Colour service,  for appoint-          ment immediately upon their discharge to          technical positions in the Government Service.   (v)   We do not recommend any change  in  the conditions          of pay, pension and seniority under which          ex-regular Civil Servants are employed.  (vi)   We are not satisfied with the existing          opportunities for ex-regulars of obtaining          Local Authority employment, but  we  have  no          further recommendations  to make  on this          general aspect of the situation. (vii)   In the limited number of cases, however,  in          which the strength of fire-brigades will be          increased under the recent Air Raids          Precautions scheme we recommend  that  Local          Authorities be asked to  give  an  effective          preference to ex-regulars,(viii)   The two principal difficulties  in  the way  of          arranging for an increased intake  of  ex-          regulars into the police are, firstly,  the          fact that in a war involving  air attacks          Chief Constables would be unable to          dispense with reservist  policemen,  and          secondly, the fact that  the age  limit is          often too low to permit  of the recruitment          of ex-regulars.        The first difficulty has been mat  by  an assurance          given by the War Office  that  a material          increase can be made in the number  of such          reservists who will not  be called up  for at          least three months.    The second difficulty          is under examination by the Home Office  and          the Scottish Office.    We wish to  emphasise          the importance of a satisfactory settlement          of this matter.        We now have reason to anticipate that pro-          vine ial Police forces will shortly  absorb an          additional intake of from 500 to 500  ex-regu-          lars a year,  and the Metropolitan Police an          additional 250 a year.
(ix)  We are glad to note that- the Boar a of        Education are doing all in their power to        press the claim of ex-regular physical        training  instructors to employment in        secondary schools, both public and grant-        aided,  and to employment under the new        national scheme for physical training and.        recreation. (x)  We are of opinion that it may be desirable        eventually,  when there are insufficient        disabled men in industrial life to maintain        the King&apos;s Roll in its present form,  to start        a new form of Roll,  under which firms would        undertake to employ a minimum percentage of        ex-regulars.    There are valid objections,        however,  to  making any change in the King&apos;s        Roll at the  present time.(Signed on behalf of the  Sub-Committee)Q.
