I agree with              the recommendations  set out in  the memorandums, and I              ask for authority  for the preparation of a  Bill and              for its submission to the Home Affairs Committee as              soon as possible.                                                W. R,              Board of Trade.                llth March, 1937.
            EXPORT  CREDITS GUARANTEE DEPARTMENT.             proposals for amending legislation.       Memorandum by the Secretary of the Department                   of Overseas Trade.     1. The Overseas Trade Acts (1920-1934) empower the Boardof Trade, with the consent of the Treasury and after consultationwith an Advisory Committee, to give guarantees in connectionwith the export of goods wholly or partly produced or manufactured in the United Kingdom, excluding munitions of war.     2. Since 1926 these powers have been administered by theExport Credits Guarantee Department under a scheme based on therecommendations of a Committee consisting of representatives ofbankers, traders and insurance experts.     3, The total value of exports in respect of which guarantees -have been issued since 1926 amounts to over   100,000,000.    Theseguarantees have been given without cost to the taxpayer, as theclaims paid and the expenses of administration have been largelyexceeded by the premium income.   The claims paid to date underthe scheme, i.e. since 1926, amount to about  850,000..At 31st March, 1936, the aggregate surplus amounted to about 2,000,000.     4.- As the Department&apos;s facilities have become better known,the use made of them by traders has grown in a remarkable manner.The value of the exports in respect of which guarantees have beengiven by the Department has increased as follows:-                  1933-4              7,506,816                  1934-5             14,978,125                  1935-6             20,557,373                  1936-7 estimated   34,000,000
     5. As guarantees are given for only a percentage of these exports and some of the guarantees run off fairly quickly, the Department has been able to limit its outstanding liability at any moment to a much smaller figure.   But this potential liability is of necessity increasing with the growth of the business of the Department.     6. The Department&apos;s business in long credits for heavy machinery, which will remain outstanding for several years, is developing rapidly in present international conditions. Large commitments exist or are under completion for Brazil, Poland, U.S.S.R. and Turkey.   Business of a similar kind is expected in China.     7. These developments raise the question of the Statutory limit on the amount of the Departments commitments, which is at present fixed at  26,000,000.   This limit may well be reached by 30th September next;  and in default of further legislation the Department will be compelled in the near future to announce that it is precluded from considering new proposals since those already before it would probably exhaust the Statutory limit.   I, therefore, submit that legislative authority bo sought for an increase of this limit,which the Treasury, who concur in this proposal, suggest should be fixed for the present at  50 millions.   This legislation must be passed through  all its stages beforeParliament rises in&apos;the summer, if the impasse already referred to is to bo avoided.     8.  It would be advisable  that tho legislation should provide for the abolition of the various time limits on theDepartment&apos;s activities which  find place in the existing Acts,so that the Departments functions would continue to beexercised (with the consent of the Treasury as at present)
until  Parliament otherwise determines.     9.  It is proposed with the agreement  of the Treasury that-any money reguired to implement guarantees shall if and so faras it  is not paid out of moneys provided by Parliament becharged  on the Consolidated Fund.   The object of thisprovision is to make the guarantee formally complete;  it isnot intended to alter the present practice under which payments under  guarantees arc in fact met from the Vote.     10. Certain other amendments of a minor character whichhave for some time been thought to be desirable could with advantage be included in the proposed Bill.     11. I, therefore, submit that approval Should be givenfor the  introduction during the present session of legislation to amend the Overseas Trade Acts(1920-34)in respect of thefollowing matters:-         (a) Tho increase in the limit of guarantees which              may at any time be outstanding, from  26 millions              to  50 millions.         (b) The abolition of the time limits on the              Department&apos;s activities imposed by Sec. 1. of              tho.Overseas Trade Act, 1934.         (c) Authority to charge on the Consolidated Fund,              if and so far as not otherwise provided, any              amounts required to implement the Department&apos;s              guarantees.         (d) Certain minor amendments of the existing Acts.                                       E.W.2nd March, 1937.
