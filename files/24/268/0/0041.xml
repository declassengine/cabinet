THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT-j-    321  ,  ,  ........        . Printed for  the Cabinet.  March 1987.SECRET.CP. 91  (37).CABINET.RELATIONS  WITH THE  IRISH FREE  STATE.         Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.    I CIRCULATE herewith the texts of the various telegrams which have comefrom the Dominions in reply to our telegram of the 2nd February (CP. 52 (37))regarding the recent Irish Free State legislation.  My colleagues will see.that allthe Dominions express themselves as in agreement with us in principle,  thoughit  should  perhaps  be noted  that in one  or  two of  their messages  the  precisesignificance of our  phrase &apos;&apos; we should be prepared to treat the proposals as noteffecting a fundamental alteration  in the position of the Irish Free  State as amember of the Commonwealth &quot; would appear to have been missed.  In addition,Australia and South Africa are in general  agreement  with  us on our  detailedcomments regarding the phraseology of the Free State legislation,  whilst Canada.takes a somewhat different view regarding some of these points of detail.      s    I have not yet informed Mr. Dulanty of. this, except that I have told  himinformally that&apos;&apos; two or three &apos;&apos; of the Dominions agree with the comments whichwe made regarding details, and particularly with the view that Article I of theexisting Constitution should be continued in the new Constitutional legislation.

APPENDIX  ITelegrams from the United  Kingdom High Commissioner in Canada.   Dated                            March 1 and 2, 1937.    I HAVE received letter from the Prime Minister notifying concurrence ofthe Canadian Government in  tentative conclusions reached  by-His Majesty&apos;sGovernment  in the United Kingdom in  paragraph 10  of your No. 48  of the2nd February.  Remainder of letter reads as follows :      Begins:  While your Governments regret at the disappearance of certainconstitutional forms is understood,  and while certain other aspects of the legis-lation  might not meet with favour if  their adoption  should  be proposed inCanada, Canadian Government would be reluctant to offer any criticism of detailsof the legislation.  It is the view of this Government that members of the BritishCommonwealth of Nations may be  interested in the legislation of a particularmember to the extent that legislation may involve a fundamental change in the relationship inter se of members of  the Commonwealth.    Having established that proposal does not effect fundamental alteration ofposition of the Irish Free State as a member of the Common wealth, it would seemto follow that the Canadian Government should not offer any observations as to detailed provisions.    -    Without  entering  upon  a discussion of  points  raised in  the  eleventhparagraph Of the memorandum (your  telegram No.  48)  which are  subject topreceding remarks,  I venture to suggest action taken in the Irish Free State maybe interpreted in a somewhat different way. It may be pointed out, for example,that there  is. no provision in Canadian  Constitution corresponding to Article 1of the  Irish Constitution.  Elimination of Article  1 would not, in our opinion,make the Irish Free State any the less member of the British Commonwealth thanCanada.   Both of these  members   would find  their  position  stated in otherconstitutional documents such as the Report of the Imperial Conference, 1926.Fact that it is not stated in the Constitution as such does not seem to be of  seriousimport.   - With regard to point dealt with in sub-paragraph (&amp;), while we appreciate that it is  possible  to construe words &quot; influenced by their &quot; as  relating only toAustralia,  Canada, Great Britain,  New Zealand and South Africa, we are notinclined to think  such a construction would be justified  if Act  is considered asa whole.   The operative language seems to repel such a construction.  The King-is to act on behalf of the Irish Free State, on the advice of Executive Council, inexternal relations, and this appears to be a definite statutory recognition by IrishFree State of position of the King as  symbol  of their  co-operation with othermembers of the-Commonwealth.    The point dealt with&apos; in sub-paragraph (c) presents  more difficulty.  the language used is not felicitous, and it may well give rise to misunderstanding inthe minds of many people. I am confident that  no  reflection could possibly havebeen intended by  legislative authority in the Irish  Free  State in using terms inquestion, and it may well be  hoped that the Irish authorities, when they  becomeaware  of this possible misunderstanding, will give consideration to the possibilityof a change in phraseology.    You will understand,  therefore, that the Canadian Government would not desire  to participate in representations to the Government of the Irish Free state with regard to certain aspects  of drafting of this legislation.

APPENDIX  II.Telegram from the United Kingdom High Commissioner in the Commonwealth of                    Australia.   Dated February 15, 1937&apos;.        ,    IN letter dated the 12th February received to-day Prime Minister asks me toinform you that the views of the  Commonwealth Government, after careful con-sideration of all aspects of the Irish. Free State&apos;s constitutional proposals, are asfollows :      Begins : The proposals may prima facie indicate a further loosening of the connection  between the Irish Free State and  the  United Kingdom, but  it isdoubtful if they do more than indicate the position as it has actually been for sometime.  The present proposals  along with Mr. De Valera&apos;s assurances show the wish of the Irish Free State to preserve its relationship with the other membersof the British  Commonwealth of Nations generally.    From that  point of  view, therefore,  the  proposals  should,  it   is felt,  be welcomed.  At the same time, it  is thought that the legislation is ambiguouslyworded,  especially Section  (3) (1) of the External  Relations  Act, and  thatambiguity should be pointed out and greater clarity urged.    In this connection, the three points brought forward by the United KingdomGovernment appear to the Commonwealth Government  to be (corrupt  group-:? reasonable).  In regard to (a), the inclusion of Article  1 of the present Constitu-tion or  its equivalent (i.e., a  formal  statement  that the Irish Free  State is  aco-equal  member of the British Commonwealth of  Nations)  either  in the newConstitution or External Relations Act, the Commonwealth Government feels thatit would be desirable to accept Mr. De Valera&apos;s point of  view, based as it probablyis on internal politics, and ask for its inclusion not  in  the new Constitution butin the External Relations Act only.    With regard  to the  second  point (b)  hereof,  Commonwealth Governmentagrees that the language of Section (3)  (1) might be altered, particularly in regardto the use of words &quot; their co-operation.&quot;  The wording does not make it clearthat the  Irish Free State recognises the King as the symbol  of its co-operationalso.   The doubt is strengthened by the use of the words &quot; co-operation &quot; when&quot; associated &quot; is used above.  It seems desirable that the Irish Free State be askedto remove this doubt by altering the text of the Section.  If it is prepared to do this,  then the  Commonwealth  Government thinks that  it should be possible forpoint (a) to be surmounted also in re-drafting of Section (3) (1).    In  regard to the  third point of the United  Kingdom Government,  theamendment of Article 51 of the Constitution, whereby  the King is spoken of asan organ, appears to the Commonwealth Government to be a  derogatory  way to describe His Majesty, and the Irish Free State might  well be asked  to considersubstitution of  a specific reference  even if  only  for  the  sake of externalappearances.    Generally,  the Commonwealth Government feels  that opportunity which&apos;presents itself should not be lost of clarifying the relationship- of a member of theBritish Commonwealth of Nations vis-a-vis the other members.  Mr. De  Valerahas stated that he does not intend that the Free State  should cease to be a full member   of  the  Commonwealth.   At  the  same time  he has referred  to  thepossibility of the Free State one day deciding to sever its connections with theCommonwealth and becoming a Republic.   The Commonwealth Government hasnoted  that  various  spokesmen  from  other  Dominions  have ; enunciated  asimilar view.    Following  on declaration and passage  of Statute  of Westminster  byDominions with the exception of Australia and New  Zealand,  who have  also indicated their intention of passing Statute, the members of the British Common-wealth have complete independence so far as their internal affairs are concerned.All that  the United Kingdom  or a Dominion  can now ask of another Dominionis a recognition of the King as a common symbol so far  as external relations and free association as a Commonwealth are concerned.   This  the Irish Free State isprepared to recognise, which is demonstrated by the acceptance of the  coronation oath in  its latest form.
    The view of the Common wealth -&apos;Government&apos;vis;:&apos;thatJ.The discussions havingreference  to  the Coronation  Oath  and the questions  under review have beenproductive of much good, and that it is of paramount importance that the presentposition should be  stabilised.  This, it is felt, can best be done at the moment byacceptance of the view of the United Kingdom Government that, subject to minor modifications indicated, the new constitutional proposals are not  regarded aseffecting a fundamental alteration in the position of the Irish Free State as. amember of the British Commonwealth of Nations.  Ends.APPENDIX III.Telegram from the Governor-General of New Zealand dated February 19, 1937.    HIS Majesty&apos;s Government in New Zealand agree with the view expressedby His MajestyV Government in the United Kingdom that proposals should betreated as not effecting a fundamental alteration in the position of the Irish FreeState as a member of the British Commonwealth.APPENDIX IV.   Tele gram from  the United Kingdom High Commissioner in  the  Union of                    South Africa&quot; dated February 27, 1937.    I HAVE received for communication to His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited  Kingdom following statement of views  of His Majesty&apos;s Government inthe Union of South Africa :     Begins.:  On the whole His Majesty&apos;s  Government in the Union agrees withHis Majesty&apos;s Government in the United  Kingdom that the Irish  proposals arein substance  not such as to effect fundamental  alteration in the position of theIrish Free State as a member  of the British Commonwealth of Nations.  It wouldappear that Mr. De Valera&apos;s position is as  follows :-  ;  (1)  The Irish Free State desires to remain  a member of  the Commonwealth;    (2)  The  King continues  as heretofore to exercise his functions  in external           Irish relations;  and    (3)  Also  remains the  symbol  of  free association  of  members  of  the           Commonwealth.    In substance, and verbal phrasing apart, this seems to be not an unreasonableposition to take up.    His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Union welcomes the attitude of the BritishGovernment,  as continuation  of the Irish Free State as a member of  the BritishCommonwealth of  Nations would, apart from being a matter  of great  importanceto all members, appear, in view of Free State&apos;s geographical position, to be oneof essential interest to the United Kingdom, and  to make extrusion of the IrishFree State from the Commonwealth almost unthinkable.    As  regards detailed points calling for elucidation, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the Union would like to add the following remarks :     (a)  Article 1 of anticipated Constitution is important and should  be retained in one form  or another.   At the  same time President  De  Valera seems  to be substantially correct  in  his  contentions that continued membership is fairlyimplied in the new External Relations Act as it stands.  A more explicit declara-tion is desirable, but should not be a breaking point.    (&amp;)  and  (c)  Both these  points  appear well  founded.  The difficulty is apparently due to  faulty and hasty drafting of  the  recent Irish Act.  president de Valera ought to meet the British Government fairly in regard to them.    The difficulties have  now reached a stage when  they ought to be  the subjectof reasonable negotiation between the two  Governments.  His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the Union would most heartily welcome a settlement.  Ends.
