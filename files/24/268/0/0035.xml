mWPIDENTlAL.                     BOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL.                      STATE OF TRADE - JANUARY, 1957.             Summary of reports submitted by members of the Board               of  Trade Advisory Council  (supplemented in some            cases with statistical information from other sources).OVERSEAS TRADE.   Imports in January at  75.6 m. were  5.6 m.more than in January 1936.   About 70^o of the rise was in food and raw materials.   Of the increase of  1.6 m. in manufacturedgoods  952,000 related to non-ferrous metals and manufactures,and  473,000 to machinery;  there were substantial decreasesin oils, fats and resins, and iron and steel manufactures.Exports of United Kingdom products,  39.1 m.-,- were  4.6 m.more and re-exports,  5.l:;i., were  756,000 more than in January1936. .EMPLOYMENT.  Employment in January shewed a much smallerseasonal decline than in recent years.   The total number ofunemployed persons on the registers at 25th January -1,689,223 - was 60,504 more than at 14th December:  the mainvariations were:-      London        + 26,483   North Western  - 3,715      South Eastern t 11,557   Northern       -   869      South Western + 12,586   Scotland       * 5,947      Midlands      H-  7,924   Wales          H-   614      North Eastern -     25     The estimated number of insured persons aged 16-64 inemployment (excluding agricultural workers) was 11,106,0 00- 26,000 less than in December but 715,000 more than inJanuary 1936.     Employment declined (as compared with December) in the distributive trades, wood working, the printing and papertrades, metal goods, motor vehicle, electrical apparatus,wool textile and hosiery, building and food industries and     284A. 0.372.
                                                          285   Ithe hotel etc. and port transport services;  but it increased in the coal, cotton and linen, hat and cap making, and boot  andshoe industries, stone quarrying and public works contracting.RAILWAY TRAFFIC.  In the four weeks ended 31st January railway traffic receipts decreased by  49,000 (0.45$) compared with  thecorresponding period of 1936.   Passenger traffic increased  by1.25$, and merchandise, minerals and livestock by 2.4$, whilecoal, coke and patent fuel decreased by 6.57$.SHIPPING AND SHIPBUILDING.   The Chamber of Shipping index number of freights (1913 ^ 100) for January was 139.49 ascompared with 135.51 in December and 90.64 in January, 1936.  Inthe second half of January, however, rates lost most of the  rise of the preceding six weeks and were still falling early inFebruary.     In 1936 the world total of shipping launched was 2,118,000tons gross, of which 856,000 tons gross was from berths inGreat Britain and Ireland - 63$ and 72$ respectively more thanin 1935.                                              -BANKING.  Money was plentiful throughout the month and conditionsreturned to normal after the recent temporary stringency.    the banks readily bought bills from the market;  and there was  keencompetition for Treasury Bills, the rate fluctuating between12s. 5. 63d.  and 10s. 3.61d.    Notes returned from circulation.Against these indications of easy money there were heavy payments in respect of revenue and bankers&apos; deposits at the Bank ofEngland ran at a lower level than in 1936.    The price of goldtended to rise and fluctuated between 141/5?  and 142/-.  the cash price of silver moved between 20^d. and 21j^&amp;. , with afalling tendency.   In spite of considerable pressure which involved a rise in the French Bank Rate from 2$ to 4$ the spotfranc remained around 105-g-j  but the widening of the discount                                   9      3on the 3 months forward franc *raa l^g to 3    reflected the realweakness of the French exchange.   The dollar was steady between4.89? and 4. 9lf.                            -2-

   GOALa   The average weekly output during the 13 weeks ended 23rd January was 4.65 in. . tons as compared with.73 m. tons in the corresponding period a year &quot;before.The average number of wage earners employed was slighty more.   Exports in January amounted to 2.99 m. tons ascompared with 2.79 m. tons a year before.   By far thegreatest increase was to Prance (316,000 tons more).Egypt and Spain took substantially less.   IRON AMD STEEL.   Pig-iron output (651,000 tons)was 9fa more than in January, 1936.   114 furnaces werein blast at the end of the month - 4 more than a monthbefore.   The recent increase in domestic prices didnot discourage demand.   Producers of semi-finished steel continued extremely active.   Some inconveniencewas caused by delays in delivery of Continental semis.Crude steel production (999,000 tons) was nearly :10$greater than in January.,  1936.   Finished steelproducers delivered record tonnages;  there was a goodvolume of export enquiries.   Exports of iron and steel(215,000 tons) were 10,000 tons more than in december and 50,000 tons more than in January, 1936.   imports were considerably less.     All areas reported increased activity and demand.^n Scotland additional steel plant was opened and furtherextensions are planned,   Sheet makers (until recentlyleast satisfactorily placed) operated at 60-70% of capacity;  they and re-rollers could have worked at ahigher level if raw material supplies had been more readily available.   On the North Bast Coast a large new blast furnace began operations.   Consumers are assured of their immediate requirements.   Sheet works were operating close to capacity after long relative idleness.   In the Sheffieldarea fresh plant is gradually coming into use.  Additional
coke-oven plant, blast furnaces and steelworks have &quot;been planned in Lincolnshire and one steel furnace isexpected to be ready before June.   In South wales the tinplate industry was slightly better employed and operated at over 67% of capacity.   The general position of the sheet trade improved.   ENGINEERING.   General activity and the volume oforders and new enquiries further increased.     Exports of machinery amounted to  3.5 m. ascompared with  3,2 m. in January, 1936.   Imports, 1.76 m., were nearly  -g- ra* more than a year before,mainly because of increased imports of machine tools.   MOTOR INDUSTRY.   The number of motor vehiclesnewly registered in December was 36,832 - 7,331 morethan a year before;  the increase in private cars was,333.   The production of private cars in november was 30,667 as against 27,339 a year before and theproduction of commercial vehicles increased from,046 to 9,240.   Exports of new private cars and chassisin January amounted to 6,489, and of new commercial vehicles and chassis to 1,846, as compared with,540 and 1,337 respectively in January, 1936.   1,716complete new private cars were imported as comparedwith 1,119 a year ago.   LIGHT METALS.   Activity was maintained, in mosttrades.   Non-ferrous metal mills and toolmakersstill found it difficult to give prompt delivery.In the tool trades the main demand was from the home market but exports also increased.   Cutlery trade was -patchy but,orders were better than a year ago and exportdemand showed signs of improvement.   The foundry andpresswork trades continued very bus:y indeed.    In thesmallwares trade the shortage of labour (especiallyjuvenile) persisted.                         -4-
     ELECTRICAL  INDUSTRY.  During  the first  half of January  thegeneral supply side of  the industry had  a  stagnant tendency  hutit improved  towards the end of  the month.  The  outlook  appearssatisfactory,  More heavy engineering orders were placed both at home and  abroad than in the  previous  month or January 1936.Consumption  of electricity amounted to 2,172 m. units -10.2% more than a year before.     COTTON.  The recent improvement in  activity and moderaterecovery in  export trade were maintained.  The  average  dailyyarn output  was lower than in December,  but  average weeklydeliveries of raw cotton to spinners were  3o. 8  m. &quot;lbs.  ascompared with 27.4 m.  lbs. in December and 29.5 m. lbs. inJanuary, 1935.  Raw cotton prices  continued  to  rise, but priceagreements enabled spinners&apos; margins to  be maintained.  Yarnexports at 13.8 m. lbs. were more  than in  any month in  1936.Exports of piece-goods at 161 m. sq. yds.  were  9 m. sq. yds.less than in December (when, however, there  were more working days);   the most important increases were  to  India, Australiaand Denmark, while the chief decreases were  to British  and FrenchWest Africa and Dutch past Indies.     WOOL.   General activity       ther less  than during-December,  but the decline was chiefly apparent in the woollensection.  Exports of tops and of yarns declined, but exportsof tissues rose as compared with December.    Raw wool pricesshowed  a further substantial advance.             &apos;  .-&apos;     SILK AND ARTIFICIAL SILK.     Rayon.  Demand, for viscose yarns in Lancashire and Yorkshireand by  the hosiery and underwear trades continued satisfactory.Demand  for staple fibre remained fairly steady.   Trade  in rayonpiece-goods was poor;   uncertainty as to price cutting by
manufacturers prevented the placing of large contracts and sales were also affected &quot;by the fashion for woollens.  Exportsof yarns were less than in &quot;December, but exports of  tissueswere greater.     3ilk.  During the January sales more yardage was soldthan last year, but owing to a general price reduction turnoverwas no greater.  The silk trade is now being badly affected bythe competition of rayon.     HIDE3 AND TFATHER.,  The hide markets in certain parts ofthe world after an early rise in January showed a decliningtendency towards the end of the month;  but European pricescontinued to rise.     Demand for leather was fairly active.   Many consumers areresisting price advances necessitated by higher raw materialcosts and are tending to use lower grades of leather.     CHEMICAL ij. ,Home sales of alkalis and heavy chemicals were slightly less than in December, but exports increased.  deliveries of chlorine products, and sales of sulphuric and hydrochloricacid were well maintained,.   Sales of industrial nitrogen productswere higher than in January, 1936;  but sales of dyestuffs werelower.   Home sales of sulphate of ammonia still showed anincrease over last season;   export sales as a whole showed adecrease though Empire markets and China have taken more.Trade in coal tar and wood  distillation products was good andin pharmaceutical chemicals steady.     .RTTAIL TRAD&quot;h   The money value of retail sales in december was 5.dp higher than in December 1936.  Sales of food andperishables rose by 7.2ri, and of other merchandise by 4rj.Preliminary returns for January show less satisfactory results,particularly in jjOndon and  the Jouth.
     POTTERY.  The general level of employment in Januarywas substantially higher than a year before.  There was theusual seasonal lull in the general earthenware trade atthe outset but the month closed with much activity onCoronation ware.  Glazed wall and hearth tile factoriescontinued fully occupied.     AUSTRALIAN TRADE.  The demand for wool was well maintained and the average price for January exceeded thatfor December and the last six months of 1936.  8,376,000bales were received into store from 1st July to 31st December(about the same quantity as a year before) and thequantity sold or shipped was 1,376,000 bales as comparedwith 1,473,000 bales a year before.     Wheat and flour shipments from 1st December 1936to 26th January 1937 were equivalent to 17 m. bushelsof wheat - nearly 1 m. ,bushels more than a year before.     Butter shipments from 1st July to 30th January 1937were 42,700 tons as compared with 55,900 tons a year before.   Imports of merchandise during December amountedto  8.95 m.  (Australian currency) as compared with  9.03 m.in December, 1935.     SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE.  Imports in November showed atrifling decline from November, 1935, but a slight increaseif Government.stores and specie are excluded; imports inthe previous ten months had averaged 15.3f0 more than inthe corresponding period of 1935.  Exports (excluding gold)were 24% more than in November, 1935; wool and diamondsshowed substantial increases but maize exports were          .negligible.  Gold exports were 18^ less, but the dailyaverage tonnage of ore crushed reached a fresh record.Japanese and German buying dominated the wool  market,                                                   -which was firm and buoyant.     INDIAN TRAPS.   Imports of merchandise in January(12,59 lakhs) were 47 lakhs less than a year before;  but
exports (22,07 lakhs) were 7F 74 lakhs greater.  In most partsof India crops are reported to he in good condition; thearea under wheat is estimated to he rather less than lastseason.  The yield of raw sugar is expected to he substantially greater.                       SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.     Argentina.  Exports in 1936 were 5.3$ greater in value,but 10.2$ less in volume than in 1935; imports were 5.2$greater in volume but 5$ less in value.  The  surplus of exports over imports was estimated at $535 m. as comparedwith $394 m. in 1935.  The United Kingdom share of imports was 20.4$ compared with 21.2$ in 1935 and Japan&apos;s share alsofell; the United States and Germany slightly  increased theirshares.  Grain shipments in January were much larger thana year before.  The new wheat crop is of fine quality; a goodaverage crop of maize is expected; the cotton crop has suffered damage but in view of the larger area is expectedto exceed last year&apos;s.     Brazil. The surplus of exports over imports further increased in November.  Coffee exports for January-Novemberwere less than half total exports. The cotton crop may notbe much larger than last year&apos;s.  The voliime  of export oforanges in 1936 was 22$ more than in 1935.     Chile.  The surplus of exports over imports in the first10 months of 1936 was substantially greater than a year before.There has recently been less difficulty in effectingpayments in sterling and United States dollars.     Uruguay.   In the first nine months of 1936 the UnitedKingdom share of Uruguay&apos;s trade, both import and export,      .was appreciably larger than a year before.  Shipments of wooland hides up to 31st January were grerter than in thecorresponding period of the previous season.
     Colombia. Coffee exports in 1936 were a record. Theforeign exchange position of the Central Bank has improved.     Peru. Cotton exports in 19-36 are estimated to have beenslightly larger than in 1935; crop prospects appear  favourable.The sol appreciated sharply.     3quador.  A shortage of foreign exchange for importsmay scon be relieved by the outward movement of the cotton crop.     Venezuela.   Trade was more active than for severalyears1  past and there is increased confidence.
