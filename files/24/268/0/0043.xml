THE CABINET        THE ARMY  AND AIR FORCE  (ANNUAL)  BILL      MEMORANDUM BY  THE  SECRETARY  OF STATE  FOR  WAR     1.  I circulate herewith the Army and Air Force (Annual) Bill, with a prefatory    110Memorandum  explaining the  reasons for the more important amendments  of  the  GeneralArmy Act and the Air Force Act.                                                    5044     2.  The Bill makes certain changes in those Acts consequential on the changes instatus of Burma and Aden ; it removes certain anachronisms ; and it makes a numberof minor editorial amendments.     3.  Clause 4 is explained in the memorandum prefixed to the Bill.  Briefly, troops and horses can in peace be billeted only  on the keepers  of  victualling-houses,  by whom they are lodged and  fed  (or, if desired, provided with furnished lodging andcertain cooking facilities but no food) in accordance with  the scale laid  down in  theArmy Act (Second Schedule) at prices  fixed  by the  Army  Annual Act.   In war  theliability to provide billets of this nature is extended to the owners of  public buildions or any  householder  who possesses the requisite accommodation.   The  Departmentdesires to be able in war, but not in peace, to demand billeting facilities less than those laid down in the A.A. Second Schedule (e.g. furnished  lodgings  without food  orcooking facilities, or unfurnished lodgings), and although this was done  in the  great war it is not absolutely clear that the law allows  it.   The  proposed  amendment willremove  any doubt on this point.  A further defect in the existing  law  is that  whilethe rates payable to non-victuallers can be fixed by War Office  regulation, those pay-able to victuallers must be fixed, in war as in peace, by Act of Parliament.   The amend-ment enables the Department to fix rates for victuallers in war by regulation.   Lastly,notice of the intended publication of new rates must,  as the  law now stands, be givenvis-a-vis the general public  in the London Gazette.   It  is   proposed  to  remove this requirement, while leaving  the actual rates subject, as before, to Parliamentary  veto!     4.  Clause 7 is also explained in  the memorandum  prefixed to the Bill.  If a manis serving in the United Kingdom, there  is no difficulty in arranging  that  he shallspend the last three months of his Colour service at a  Vocational Training Centre or onfurlough looking for a job.  If he is  abroad, however, it  is not always  possible  tobring him home before (a) his whole  engagement, or alternatively (b) his  Colourservice has expired, in which event although  both the Department and  the man maybe willing for him to continue to serve up to a further three months with the Coloursfor the  purposes stated above, the Act requires that he  shall  be at once (a) discharged(Section 90 (2)) or (&amp;) transferred to the Reserve (Section 90  (4))  as  the case maybe.  The amendments proposed will enable discharge or transfer to the Reserve to be delayed by agreement between the Department and the man.     A similar amendment is not required in the Air  Force Act.  If it should happenthat an  airman had to be retained for a short period of vocational training on return from service overseas, an extension or  short  re-engagement (prolongation of service)could be granted under Section 78 (1) or Section 84  (1) (b) of the Act.     5.  The amendment to  the Air Force Act (Clause 8) calls for no  special comment,as its object is simply to confer upon the Air Council powers not at present possessed bythem to make certain premature transfers to the Reserve if the airman so desires.  Theamendment is, therefore, entirely uncontroversial.  No similar amendment to the army act is desired.     6.  As my colleagues are aware, the Bill must receive the Royal Assent by the endof April, and I propose to circulate it before the House adjourns for Easter.

Army and Air  Force (Annual)  Bill.MEMORANDUM.                      CLAUSE  4.    Section 106 of the  Army Act,  which  relates  tobilleting in normal times  and applies only to  keepers ofvictualling houses, lays down  a standard of  accommo-dation,  and the Schedule to the Annual Act fixes thecharges to be made therefor.  Section 108A, which dealswith  billeting  in  cases  of  emergency,  applies  to  the occupiers  of all public buildings, dwelling mouses, ware-houses,  &amp;c.    The objectiof the proposed amendment is  to make itclear that the accommodation which can be asked for onan emergency,  either from keepers  of victualling housesor from occupiers of other buildings, may be accommoda-tion which would not satisfy the standard laid down bysection  106, e.g. lodging in dwelling-houses, but withoutfood or cooking facilities  (such as section 106 requires),or unfurnished  lodging in  public halls or other large buildings, and  also to make it clear that the existingpower under section  108A to fix prices  extends to the fixing  of  different prices  for different classes  of accom-modation and covers all  cases where billets  are called for under  an emergency Order.    Under subsection (4)  of section 108A, the regulationsfixing prices must be laid  before Parliament and may beannulled  on  an  address  from either House, and thisprovision  is not  affected.   It is, however, proposed toremove the necessity for either giving forty days&apos; noticeof the intention to make the  regulations, or procuringthem to be certified as urgent.                      CLAUSE  7.    Under section 90 of the Army Act, as it now stands, a soldier returning to the United Kingdom when due fordischarge  must  be discharged  on arrival,  and a soldierdue for transfer to the reserve must be so transferredon arrival and  cannot remain with  the  Colours unless he extends his  service. The proposed amendments willenable  the War Office,  with  the soldier&apos;s consent, to    67-4                A
 delay his discharge,  or transfer  to the reserve, thus. enabling him to remain with the Colours and to continue drawing military pay for  a  short  time while seeking opportunities of re-establishing himself in civilian life. .                       CLAUSE 8.     At  present the Air Council can, if an airman so desires, allow him to be transferred to the reserve at any time during the period for which he first enlisted.  Underthe  Act as it stands, however, they  are unable to allow an airman who has extended his engagement, or has re-engaged for  a further period (under  section 84 (1) (6)),to be transferred to the reserve during the period of airforce service for which he so extended his engagement orre-engaged.  The object of the proposed amendment isto make it possible for them to do this, if the airman sodesires.
