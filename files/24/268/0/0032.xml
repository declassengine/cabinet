ADMIRALTY,  S.W.I.   March 3rd,  1937.THIS DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;s GOVERNMENT.SECRET.                                        COPY NO. 43c.p.   fifnj                        SPAIN.                   The Rio Tinto Mines.          Note by the First Lord of the Admiralty.                 As I am prevented by illness from  attending    the Cabinet, I circulate to my colleagues the following    note prepared for me by the Naval Staff.   As I only    received the Foreign Office paper (CP.80(37))  late last    evening, it has been impossible to circulate the Naval    Staff note earlier.                           (Intld)    S.   H.
                             t                    NOTE ON CP. 80 (57).          The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs suggeststhat the position which has arisen in connection with the products of the Rio Tinto and other mines going to Germany andItaly instead of this country can he &quot;remedied without too much trouble&quot; by $csing British Warships to &quot;intercept any ship which leaves Huelva carrying any such products to Germany andItaly&quot;;          The Secretary of State also suggests that we shouldthreaten to take this action, but that we should not &quot;embark upon this course without clear determination to go through with it to the end&quot;;   He asks, however, for Cabinet approval to theCourse outlined;          The memorandum doeB not go into the question of the nationality of the ships which it is suggested should beintercepted, but this is the real crux of the matter.   Thepossible ships can be divided into three general classes:     (t)  British ships.     (2)  Spanish ships belonging to the Franco Government.     (3)  Ships of other nationalities.          To take each of these in turn -British ships-.      &apos;  *          The proposal would no doubt be practical in respectof these ships because action to divert a British ship from hercourse can be taken under British Law (though no powers existtoday and legislation would be  necessary).    No internationalcomplications should arise in respect of the ship, but there might be legal questions as to  the ownership of the cargo.                                        Franco&apos;s ships:........
Franco 1s ships:          Action against such ships could probably be justified as a reprisal for the requisitioning of the ores, which theForeign Office apparently regard as illegal and for whichadequate compensation has not been paid.  The action would no doubt be high handed, but a precedent exists set by theGermans  when they some little while ago captured a SpanishGovernment ship as a reprisal.Ships of other nationalities.          To interfere with ships of any other nationalitiesoutside  British territorial waters is an act for which no authority exists in time *f peace, and which is contrary toall the  accepted cannons of International Law,          The nation whose ships were interfered with mightwell regard such an act as a &quot;casus belli&quot;.          In the case of German and Italian ships we couldnot justify our action by reprisals as it is suggested abovewe might in the case of Franco&apos;s ships, because our grievancelegally  is against Franco and not against Germany or Italy.                  x          It is clear from the above that the only shipswe can interfere with without risk of serious complicationsare British ships or Franco&apos;s ships.  Actually we believe thatthe greater part of the ores are being carried in German or italian  ships (with possibly a few Scandinavian or Greek).It seems certain that Germany and Italy would strongly resent any interference with their shipping which they could well saywas an act quite unprecedented in time of peace.          The Secretary of State rightly says in his paper that we  should not embark on any course of action unless weare prepared to go through with it to the end.          It is necessary, therefore, to recognise that the                                                    / end

end of the course of action suggested, might quite possiblyToe war with Germany and Italy together.          It als* seems that if war unfortunately did cornsabout in such a manner, we could by no means be sure thatthe League, or any other international tribunal, would not hold that we were the aggressors.
