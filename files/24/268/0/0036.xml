THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOYERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  March 1937.SECRET.                                                        Copy No.  4^2CP. 86 (37).CABINET.PALESTINE: DEFENCE ORDERS  IN  COUNCIL,  1931 AND  1936.           Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.    RECONSIDERATION of the Palestine (Defence) Order in Council, 1931, as amended by the Palestine Martial Law (Defence) Order in Council, 1936, in  the light of experience of their operation in practice, has led me to the conclusion that their  terms are not  entirely satisfactory.    2.  In  any event, an amending Order  is  urgently required to negative a decision of the Palestine courts that Regulations under the Order of  1931 ceased to have effect, except as regards offences  already committed, when the amending Order of 1936 came into operation; and I am of opinion that the opportunity should be taken to replace these two Orders by an entirely fresh Order on  simpler and more effective lines.   A draft Order, which has been  prepared by my Legal Advisers for this purpose, is printed as an appendix to this memorandum.   It is, however, proposed to refer the draft to Parliamentary  Counsel, who may consider drafting amendments advisable, and I do not wish to do more than ask for  general approval for the submission of a new Order to  the King in Council on the lines of&apos; that appended to  this memorandum.    3.  Copies of the draft have been  sent to the War Office, the Air Ministry and the Admiralty for urgent consideration, and if these Departments have any alterations  of substance to suggest,  I will bring these forward orally when this memorandum is under discussion.    4.  One point to which I wish to invite attention is that the title of the draft  Order, unlike that of the amending Order of 1936, contains no reference to &quot; Martial Law.&quot;  It will be remembered that there were  special reasons at the time for introducing the words &quot; Martial Law&quot; into the title of  that Order.  A distinction has thus been drawn between &quot; Statutory Martial Law &quot; and &apos;&apos; Martial Law&apos;&apos; in the ordinary sense.  I feel  that it  is unwise  on constitutional and practical grounds  to mix up with emergency  powers legislation the doctrine of Martial Law, which is the abnegation  of law.  Accordingly, in the new draft Order, it is proposed to retain the  substance of the  amending  Order of  1936 by making  full provision for  delegation  of powers by the High Commissioner to the General Officer Commanding the Forces in Palestine, while eliminating any reference to &quot;Martial Law &quot; as a description of that procedure.    The possibility cannot be disregarded that the disturbances might amount to a rebellion so  serious,  widespread and effective, that there  was  a  complete breakdown  of the functions  of Civil Government.  In those circumstances the powers conferred by this new Order  in Council might be found by His Majesty&apos;s Government to be insufficient  to deal with the  situation,  and it might then  be necessary to declare  Martial Law  pur  et  simple,   which would  involve the suspension of all  law.
