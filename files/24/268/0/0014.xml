Copy No.  ^rjCP. 64 (37).                               CABINET.COMMITTEE ON ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTION.SECOND REPORT.  I. INTRODUCTION.    1.  AT their meeting on the 10th June, 1936 (Cabinet 41 (36) Conclusion 8),the Cabinet authorised the publication  of the Report  of  the  Committee onElectricity  Distribution  (the  McGowan  Report).   This had previously been circulated to the Cabinet as CP. 148 (36).  At their Meeting on the 25th June,1936 (Cabinet 45 (36), Conclusion 2), the Cabinet appointed the present Committeeto examine and report on the conclusions and recommendations of the McGowanReport.  The Cabinet Committee is composed as follows :         The Lord Privy Seal (Chairman).        The Lord Chancellor.*        The President of the Board of Trade or the Secretary for Mines.        The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.        The Minister of Health.        The Minister of Transport.        The Financial Secretary to the Treasury.        The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of  State for Scotland.    2.  On the 27th October, 1936, we laid a short Interim Report (CP. 288 (36))before the Cabinet.  The recommendations of this Interim Report were :       (i) The acceptance of the general conclusions of the McGowan Report;     (ii) The promise of legislation on the lines of that Report in the forthcoming          King&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament;    (iii) That the Committee be kept in being in order to examine the detailed          provisions of a Bill, which might, if time permits, be introduced later          in the Session.    The Cabinet considered our  Interim Report  on the 4th November, 1936(Cabinet 62 (36), Conclusion 14), and agreed as follows :     (a)  That the Cabinet  Committee should,  in due course,  produce a more          detailed report for  consideration by the Cabinet, containing recom-          mendations as to the action to be taken on the  report of the McGowan          Committee.    (b)  That the Minister of Transport should be authorised  to make clear in          the House of Commons that His Majesty&apos;s Government had not yet          come to any conclusions on the report, but that, in any event, so  far          as could be foreseen, the length of the Legislative Programme as set          forth in the King&apos;s Speech was likely to preclude  legislation on the          subject during the present Session of Parliament.    3.  On  the 9th November, 1936, the  Prime Minister answered  a Parlia-mentary Question in the House of Commons in the following terms :         The hon. Memher will have noticed that a full programme of legislation    is already promised for this Session, and I cannot undertake at present that      * The Lord Chancellor has been unable to attend our meetings owing to illness      [14602]                                                      B
    it will be possible  to  add to it.   But  the  Government are alive to the    importance  of  the  recommendations  made  by  the committee  for  the    reorganisation of the supply of electricity, and have the matter closely before    them.  (Hansard, col. 500.)    On the 25th November, 1938, a debate, took place  in the House of commons on a Private Member&apos;s motion, in favour of the national ownership and controlof electricity generation  and distribution;  an  amendment  was moved thatreorganisation should be on the lines recommended by the  McGowan  Committee.    The Minister of Transport in this debate said :          &quot; If it be a question of choosing between the Motion and the Amendment,    the Government would prefer to see the  amendment carried.&quot;    II. CASE  FOR REORGANISATION OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF  ELECTRICITY.    4.  Before stating  our proposals we think it well to preface them with a brief account of the disadvantages of the present situation.    The supply of electricity in Great Britain by  authorised undertakers maybe divided into two parts     (a) Generation wholesale supply to authorised distributors.    (b) Distribution retail supply to consumers.    The generation and  main transmission of electricity have  now  been fullyorganised as a result of the Act of 1926 and the establishment of the central electricity Board.  The numerous frequencies* of  supply have been replaced by a uniform frequency of  50 cycles per  second a  necessary preliminary to thecomplete functioning of the Board.    Distribution remains to be  organised.  The technical problem is somewhatparallel to that of generation, in that there are two different systems of supplyand many voltages.    The systems are :     (a) Direct current,  supplied mainly by  the  older undertakings, and    (b) Alternating current, which is the more prevalent, flexible and adaptable.    At the end of 1934-35, while 288 undertakings were  supplying  alternatingcurrent only, there were  278 other undertakings supplying both alternating and direct current,  and another 69 undertakings supplying direct current only.    Just as different frequencies of supply prevented the economic interconnectionof generating stations, so to-day numerous voltages of supply hamper distribution.There are  19 principal  voltages, whereas it is desirable to reach a minimum oftwo, namely,  230 volts for lighting and domestic purposes and 400 volts for powerand industrial purposes.    These numerous voltages adversely affect  consumers, who, if they  move fromone district to another,  may be unable to use their portable electrical apparatusbecause either  the systems or the  voltages are different.  This is  a cause of complaint  from many parts of the country and especially in the metropolitan area,  where in many districts there are  different  systems  and different voltageson opposite sides of the street.    Although, at the end of 1934-35, as many as 407  undertakings were supplyingconsumers at the standard voltages, namely,  230  and  400 volts, various under-takings were still giving supplies at  19  different voltages, varying  between100 and 250  volts, thus  involving an unnecessarily high cost in the manufactureof lamps and apparatus at a variety of miscellaneous voltages.    There are no less than 625 separate authorised undertakers operating 635undertakings. This multiplicity of undertakings is the outcome of early electricitylegislation.  That legislation was in accordance with the circumscribed technical knowledge and practice of the early years of the industry,  and Avith the fact thatat that time the principal use of electricity was for lighting only; it is respon-sible, however, for the  difficulties and anomalies  of the numerous voltages andtariffs of which the public now complains.    The tariffs charged by these numerous undertakings vary unnecessarily in character  and  in amount,  and  increase  the  public discontent.   They  urgentlyrequire clarification and  standardisation, so  far  as practicable.    *  NOTE: &quot;Frequency&quot; in alternating currents is the  number of complete alternations orcycles per second and may be compared with the pitch of teeth in a geared wheel.
     The existing situation  is  that  the population is arbitrarily  divided upbetween a very large number of electricity areas of all sizes, the greatest densityof population being as a general rule in small areas of supply, where electricaldevelopment on the basis of modern practice is easier to carry out, the remainingpopulation being spread over more extensive areas, often very sparsely populated,where development is economically more difficult.     Under present conditions these legally distinct areas of supply are developedindependently, only a  limited  degree of electrical interconnection  across  themultiplicity of boundaries being possible.  Existing powers are inadequate tosecure a proper grouping of areas, such as would ensure the maximum develop-ment of both the sparsely populated and the more densely populated areas.  Thereis a constant demand for supplies (or  for improved and cheaper supplies) in rural areas for  farms, villages and local industries, such  as brickworks, quarries, &amp;c.Owing to the  comparative sparseness of population in these areas and the longdistances  to be  covered, supplies in  rural districts  present a difficult economic problem under  present  conditions.   There  are several  instances,  however,  of successful rural supplies, in  districts where there has been a judicious blendingof urban and  rural areas.  The results have been both popular and financiallysatisfactory;  they demonstrate  that with a properly planned system there is nodifficulty in meeting the needs of the rural areas.  If  these facilities are to bemade more general, a rearrangement of areas  is imperative, such as will allow ofthe attachment of rural areas to their urban neighbours.     Under the first Electricity Acts,  passed in 1882 and 1888, power is given toa local authority in whose area  an electricity undertaking is situate  to purchasethat  undertaking at the end of 42  years, and at  the  end of  each  succeeding10 years, whether the existing undertaking be owned by^a Company or by anotherlocal authority.   Many of these franchises will shortly fall in, and during thenext  10 years, if these rights of purchase were to be fully exercised, 100 of theexisting undertakings would be split up into  no less than  344 undertakings.     Instead, therefore, of making for the more efficient grouping of  areas, thesepurchase rights represent a  potential cause of disintegration.   Where there isto-day a combination of urban  and rural areas, served by one undertaker, theirexercise would break up that area and leave  the urban and rural portions to be developed separately, to the  disadvantage of  the latter.     A  further  complication arises   from the numerous alterations  of localgovernment boundaries consequent on the Local Government Act, 1929.  Othercomplications  arise from the existence of duplicate or competitive powers in many areas.     From 1898 onwards, a number of regional power companies was  established,whose principal duty  was  to  generate  electricity and  supply it  in bulk  to-authorised distributors in the power company&apos;s area, and also to supply individual industries with power.   These power companies are not subject to any purchaserights and hold  their franchise  in perpetuity.     The Electricity (Supply) Act of 1919 had as  one objective the voluntaryestablishment  of joint electricity authorities  whose  duty it would have been to reorganise the supply of electricity in their districts.  The  absence of  compulsory powers resulted  in very little being done.  The fact that power companies were already established in  the principal  parts of  the country was a  further obstacle to reorganisation.     Of the  635  separate undertakings in existence  at the end  of 1933-34 some400 were  selling less than 10 million units a year  each.   The  aggregate sales of these 400 undertakings were less  than 10 per cent,  of the sales of all 635undertakings.     The units sold in  1933-34 in relation to  each  1 of distribution capital byundertakings of  different sizes, are shown below : A annual Sales of Undertakings.    Under 1 million units ...Units sold per  1 of distribution capital.50 and over 50 million units ...1 to 5 million  units5 to 10 million units10 to 25 million units25 to 50 million units13 1522-4730-5436-2341-6549-72[14602]B 2
The total costs of distribution per unit sold were as under :d. per unit.0 to 1 million to 5 million5 to 10 million\j uv JL  iniiiiun   ...     . . .10 to 25 million......25 to 50 million  ...50 and over 50 million ...2-481-491140-890-770-59     It  will be  seen  that  the  larger  undertakings  offer a  marked  advantage.The cost of distribution for undertakings selling  50  million units  and over perannum  is well under one-fourth of  the  cost for undertakings selling 1 million or less,  is only two-fifths of that for undertakings selling from  1  to 5 millions and about one-half of that for undertakings selling from 5 to 10 millions.     The McGowan Committee  investigated the position of holding companies and reported  that, while there are  advantages arising  from the possession of adequate financial resources, and central  management, and from the centralpurchase of materials, there are cases where these benefits are not  being passed on to the operating Company and from thence to the  consumer.  The Committeeconcluded (paragraphs 291 to  295 of the McGowan Report) that  the holding company  system  is  open  to  abuse,  and recommended  that the  ElectricityCommissioners should be authorised to require  the amalgamation of subsidiary companies  with one  another and (where desirable  and practicable) with  the holding Company or with  any associated Contracting Company;  and that the accounts of the Holding Company  and  any associated Contracting  company should be subject to official  audit.     The principal Associations which  tendered evidence  to  the  McGowanCommittee, as wTell as other witnesses of great  experience in electricity supply,were unanimous regarding the urgent need for reorganisation.    5.  As stated  in  our Interim Report, we  recommend,  as  a result of  our examination of the matter,  the  acceptance  of  the general  conclusions of  theMcGowan  Committee.   We share the view of that Committee that the existing&quot; chaotic &quot;  situation results in hardship and inconvenience to consumers and isprejudicial to the cheap and abundant supply of electricity.    The Report of that Committee stated that an essential feature of any schemeof reorganisation must be &quot; a substantial reduction in the  present number of undertakings by the substitution where appropriate of larger and more economicnnits. .  . .   Reorganisation to this effect should be based  on the retention andutilisation, where possible, of the larger and more efficient of the existing under-takings  and the absorption by such undertakings of the smaller or less efficientundertakings.&quot;    &quot; Any attempt to carry through a scheme of reorganisation on a voluntary basis  is bound to  fail,  and  legislation  must  confer  definite and  adequatecompulsory powers &quot; (McGowan Report, paragraph 471).    What we, in fact, contemplate is the reduction of the existing total of some640 undertakings to under 250.  Under our proposals about 160 of the larger localauthorities and one or two of  the existing public boards would retain possessionof their undertakings  undisturbed or even enlarged by the absorption of  theirsmaller  neighbours; and  many of the larger company undertakings would  beretained, also  absorbing their  smaller neighbours, with many of whom they  arealready  in close association.Preparation of Schemes.    6.  Before this compulsory reorganisation can take place a necessary pre-liminary step will be the division of the country by the Electricity Commissionersinto convenient areas, within the limits of which, schemes for the  consolidation ofthe separate undertakings into one or more groups can be framed.  It should bepossible to  schedule these areas to the Bill.  Power should be taken to excludeIII. STATEMENT OF OUR PROPOSALS.
particular undertakings.  After consulting the undertakers concerned, and after a full review of the circumstances, the Commissioners would prepare and publish a scheme  or schemes for each district.  This is one of our  two major departures from the  McGowan Report.  The Report recommended that the schemes shouldbe prepared by temporary paid District  Commissioners appointed for the purpose the schemes submitted by them to be investigated afresh by the Electricity Com-missioners.  It has seemed to us  essential to adopt a simpler, cheaper and moreexpeditious procedure.  We are confirmed in our opinion by the fact that prepara-tion of schemes by the Electricity  Commissioners was the procedure adopted in theAct of 1926, which set up the National Grid.     A second point upon which we cannot advise acceptance of their proposals isthe suggested denial of  appeal to the Minister and to Parliament, on the part ofsmall undertakings with an annual output not exceeding 10 million units.  we feel that  the same rights in this matter  must be  given to  all undertakingsirrespective of their size.     The  schemes would provide for  compulsory consolidation  upon  one of thethree following bases : (a)  Compulsory acquisition by one Undertaking of the other Undertakings in the        group.     Where satisfactory assurances are not given to the Commissioners  as to the tariffs and facilities to be offered  by the  one remaining undertaker, or where theyare requested to do so by undertakers representing a majority of units sold to consumers in the basic  year, the Commissioners would prepare schemes for theestablishment of either(b)  A public distribution authority to which all existing Undertakings in the area        would be transferred, or(c)  A joint Board,  to which the  undertakings of two or more  local authorities        would be transferred.     We recommend  that the Electricity  Commissioners should be required  tosatisfy themselves in the preparation  of schemes :      (i) That each scheme is likely to result in more efficient technical operation,          or in economy of capital expenditure, or in convenience of administra-          -tion, and that the resulting economies will be passed on to consumers          in the form of reduced prices.     (ii) That consumers will not be prejudicially affected  as regards regularity          and efficiency of supply.     (iii)  That the amalgamations involved are likely, on the best information          available to the Commissioners, to lead to lower prices to consumers as          the schemes achieve their full results.     In addition we contemplate  that there  should be  a provision in the Bill tothe effect that the average prices charged to consumers of particular classes in anyacquired area shall not be increased  except in special circumstances, and then only with the approval  of the  Electricity Commissioners.   The special circum-stances must be beyond  the control of, or such as could not reasonably have been avoided by,  the undertakers  for  the  scheme area, and would have affected theoriginal undertakings had there been no scheme.Confirmation of Schemes.    7.  We contemplate that after consideration  by the Electricity Commis-sioners of any representations they may receive and after any hearings which theythink it necessary  to  give, the scheme  (amended  as required)  should  become operative at once where it is agreed by all the undertakers concerned.    In all other cases the scheme would not become operative until confirmed bythe Minister of Transport and approved by Parliament.    We  are informed  that, as a result of a survey by the  Electricity Commis-sioners, it is likely that under 100 schemes would have to be prepared, of which about one-third should  not be controversial.  The process of reorganisation wouldtake not  less than five years from the enactment of the necessary legislation.  We
/recognise the importance  of  not  congesting  Parliamentary business by laying before Parliament a long series of individual schemes in a form likely to be the- occasion of obstructive opposition.    We think,  therefore, that Special Order procedure now  usually  adopted in  regard  to electricity matters should be prescribed in the Bill  in preference to procedure by Provisional Order; but this is a point on which concession will be possible and may be necessary when the Bill is in Committee. Financial Terms of Acquisition, Compensation and Purchase Price.     8.   We contemplate  that the Bill will lay down in detail the basis of the- financial terms  on which  undertakings will  be transferred or acquired.   We attach (Appendix A) a note of the bases on which we consider that the purchase price should be fixed for local authority undertakings and for company under - takings  respectively.   In  the  case of the latter it would be necessary to include a sum in respect of compensation for the loss of future profits. Control over Retained  Undertakings.     9.   The Electricity Commissioners should, in our view, be given control over retained companies in respect of  the issue of all new capital  and the relation between  their charges  for electricity and their divisible profits;  we contemplate that this matter should be dealt with in the Bill.     New powers will  also be desirable in  respect of holding companies (see paragraph 16 (d)).     Provision should be made for conferring  upon the Commissioners and the Minister of Transport more  adequate  powers over  all undertakers (whether affected by schemes or  not)  in respect of tariffs and over plans for development in rural  and other areas.  The nature and extent of these powers is indicated in Appendix B of this Report. Ultimate Public Ownership of all  Undertakings.     10.  The McGowan Report envisages  public ownership of all undertakings, including those not at present subject to purchase by the local authorities, at the end of a  term of not more than 50 years.     It will  be a necessary part of the present  reorganisation  that the existing purchase rights  of  local authorities shall  be abolished and the duration of the tenure of the consolidated companies fixed  at a period not exceeding 50 years. Protection for Central Electricity Board.     11.  Under the Electricity (Supply)  Act, 1926, the Grid Tariffs of the Central Board have been  so fixed that over a period of years the income of the Board will  cover their expenditure  and capital  charges  with an appropriate margin.  These  Tariffs have  necessarily made allowance,  on  the basis of the development of  the unamalgamated undertakings, for the estimated revenue obtainable from  supplies at the Grid Tariff and from supplies to the owners of selected stations, many of  whom are entitled by the Act of 1926  to supplies  from the Board on terms more favourable than the Grid Tariff.     The Board  give  direct  supplies to  over  200 undertakings,  and  by the amalgamation of any of these into  larger areas which will combine  industrial and  domestic demands  and public  lighting, and in some cases traction, supplies,the maximum demands  from each of which do not occur at the same time, a smaller aggregate demand would be required from the Grid System than if the existingundertakings continued to be  developed separately.     Moreover, if undertakings at  present  receiving supplies at the Grid Tariffare amalgamated with  others supplied by the owners of selected stations entitledto more favourable terms,  the  effect may be to lessen the demand for Grid Tariffsupplies.     In both these ways, the receipts of the Board would be adversely affected and provision to safeguard  their position will therefore be necessary.
iff)               XV. SOME ASPECTS OF THE MCGOWAN SCHEME.Technical advantages of reorganisation under larger units of management.    12.  In addition to securing the economies and the more progressive technical and commercial direction which may reasonably be expected from reorganisationunder larger units of management, it is in our opinion important to ensure andexpedite the adoption of          A uniform and more flexible system of supply by alternating current;         A reduction  in the excessive  number of different voltages, which is in    itself an impediment to the extension of facilities for cheap electricity; and         Some standardisation  of  tariffs, which at present shew an unnecessary    and confusing complexity.The proposal to establish Public Regional Boards controlling all undertakings.    13.  We have examined, and have compared with the McGowan scheme, thealternative proposal to establish a number of new regional public authorities towhich  the existing  undertakers,   whether municipal  or company,  would betransferred.  Mr. Herbert Morrison&apos;s speech in the debate on the 25th November,1936, contained the following p         &quot;Our suggestion  is that  the 600  odd electricity supply undertakings    should be abolished.  The  Central Electricity Board should be abolished.    The Electricity Commissioners should  be abolished.  We might  need some    technical people to take their  place.   We would scrap the lot.   We would    transfer the generating and distributing undertakings to a national corpora-    tion, a business  concern.....   We would establish, under  the  national    board, regional boards for  appropriate  regions, but they ought to be subject    to the policy of the national board itself.&quot;  [Hansard, columns 467 and 477.)    Our examination of the proposal  for regional boards leads us, however, tothe same conclusion as  was reached by the McGowan Committee, namely,  thatsuch a  schema  would cause an unnecessary dislocation  of many well-managedundertakings which have proved to be economic distribution units.  In addition,there would be considerable uncertainty as to the amount of the  compensation tobe paid, since there is at present no statutory or  accepted basis for the purchaseof power companies with  rights  in  perpetuity.  Compensation determined inthese circumstances might impose an undue financial burden on the new regional authorities, which would be detrimental to existing consumers and to  futured development.  There would be strong opposition  to the transference of companyundertakings, particularly power  companies with perpetual rights,  to  public ownership.  There would probably also be strong opposition on the part of thelarger municipal authorities, who, under such a  plan, would be deprived of the ownership and control of their undertakings.  The fact that the McGowan Reportrejected the regional boards proposal would in any case make it somewhat difficult for His Majesty&apos;s  Government  to adopt it, in the absence of new and conclusivearguments in its favour.Opposition to the McGowan scheme of municipal authorities and  of the advocates         of municipal trading and public ownership.    14.  We understand that there is a  possibility of joint opposition by theAssociation of  Municipal  Corporations  and  the  Incorporated  MunicipalElectrical Association to any proposals to transfer public authority undertakings to private ownership.   This opposition would doubtless attract the support ofthose  who consider that municipal trading  is  in itself  advantageous to thecommunity.    The Association of  Municipal Corporations (see Appendix C) have urgedthat reorganisation should be based on the utilisation of existing  municipal unitsas nuclei to which  the smaller municipal undertakings could be attached.    The Minister of Health, however, has advised us that the opposition of localauthorities and their supporters is of comparatively small  importance in relationto the political opposition which is inevitable.
s    The opposition of these interests might also be mitigated by the provisionfor the ultimate public ownership of all electricity  undertakings (see  para-graph 10 above).Probable Reception of a Bill based on the  McGowan proposals.    15.  We  entertain no  doubt that public opinion  will mainly judge  our proposals by whatever prospects they hold out of a cheaper electricity  supplythroughout the country.  The result of our  enquiries in this direction is definitelyencouraging.  Our examination of a series of typical cases of the amalgamation of smaller supply undertakings with their larger  neighbours, on the terms of acquisition recommended in the McGowan  Report, shows that in  the majority ofcases immediate reductions  in price could  be given to consumers  where the levelof consumption is the same as the level of corresponding consumers in the area ofthe larger undertaking.  These  reductions  would be made possible     (a) by economies in management and operation;    (5) by the application of existing surpluses which the larger units would no           longer need to retain against contingencies;    (c)  because on the  terms  recommended  by the  McGowan  Committee  the           capital charges falling on the purchasing authority will in many cases         .  be  less than those now being borne by the purchased authorities.    The stimulus which these lower prices  would apply to consumption might beexpected to enable  further reductions, or  other  benefits,  to  be  extended to consumers, both domestic and industrial. .    In  addition, consumers in towns may be expected to welcome legislationeliminating the existing anomalies of tariffs, charges and systems, while the ruralpopulation may be expected to welcome  the prospect  of a wider and  earlierdistribution of electricity in rural districts.Further reasons in favour of an early decision.    16.  In our view early action for the  reorganisation of electricity distribu-tion is necessary for the reasons set out in  the following paragraphs :     (a) The longer the present non-standardised development is allowed to go onthe more expensive will be the eventual process of standardisation.    (&amp;) Purchase rights are maturing and  will mature  more rapidly in the nextfew years, and thus  afford opportunities  for actual disintegration if nothing is done.    (c)  The Electricity Commissioners are  at present without guidance regardingthe line  to  be adopted when their consent  is asked to a purchase by a localauthority.  There is before  the Commissioners at the present time a proposal bythe Corporation of Newcastle-on-Tyne to  purchase parts of the undertakingswithin the city area.  The Commissioners  would, however, be prepared, if thereis shortly to be a reorganisation on the lines recommended by the Committee, toensure that the question of  purchase should be deferred until the whole positionin the district has been reviewed and the best scheme worked out.    (d) Control is necessary over  the terms on which capital  is borrowed by existing company undertakings.  A recent instance of the weakness of the.existingprotection  for consumers is an  application to the  Commissioners by the  ClydeValley Company for powers to borrow additional capital.  The Company proposeto issue shares, the market value of which  is about 45s., to their existing  share-holders at 30s.; the Commissioners do not  consider this  to  be in  the interests of consumers, but they have no power to attach conditions to their consent.    As regards holding companies the  Commissioners should be  given power to check abuses such as over-capitalisation, the imposition  of excessive managementfees and of excessive  charges for services carried out by the holding company onbehalf of  a subsidiary  company,  and  the  charging  of excessive interest  onadvances made to associated companies.  In view of the specific recommendationof the McGowan Committee drawing attention to these abuses, which have formed the subject of comment in Parliament, it would be difficult to leave unchanged a situation in which statutory undertakers are free to take action of this kind.    (e)  There is nothing at present to prevent voluntary amalgamations  on  the wrong lines, e.g.,  the recent purchase  by  a company under Italian control ofisolated undertakings in various parts of the country.&quot;
IS                   V. COURSE OF ACTION RECOMMENDED.     17.  The McGowan Report was published last June, and it will be difficultto defer much longer an announcement of the Governments intentions.   If theCabinet approve our recommendations in principle, we suggest that they authorisethe issue of a statement of policy, in the form of a White Paper, as early aspossible.  The White Paper should set out the proposals in as much detail as maybe practicable.     The  White Paper will give the  interests  concerned an  opportunity of discussing the scheme and of formulating any suggestions which they may haveto make.  We anticipate also that  it will be successful in removing  many doubtsand  some opposition.     We suggest also that the Minister of Transport should be authorised to give instructions at an early date for the preparation of a Bill, to be introduced in the1937-38 Session.  We regard it as most desirable that the Bill  should become law before the close of that Session.       VI. SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND  RECOMMENDATIONS.18.   Our conclusions and recommendations may be summarised as follows :   (i) We recommend the acceptance of the general conclusions and recom-       mendations of  the McGowan Report, of which the essential features       are :         (a) a  substantial reduction in  the  present  number  of  electricity             distribution undertakings by the retention of the larger  and             more  efficient  of the  existing  undertakings,  whether  local             authority or company, and the absorption by such undertakings             of the smaller or less efficient undertakings;       (b) legislation conferring definite and adequate compulsory powers  is             essential; any attempt to carry through a scheme of reorganisa-             tion on a voluntary basis is bound to fail;       (c) the schemes of reorganisation should  provide for  the possibility             of  ultimate public ownership  of all undertakings, including             those  not  at  present  subject to  purchase  by  the  local             authorities. (ii) If our conclusions are approved in principle, we recommend the issue at       an early date of a statement of  Government policy, in the form of a       White Paper.(iii) We recommend that authority be given for the preparation of a  Bill       based  on  the recommendations of the McGowan Report.   The  Bill       should be passed into law during the 1937-38 Session.(iv) We agree with the McGowan Committee that the general reorganisation       of the electricity distribution industry on a regional basis under public       control could not at the present  time be justified.                              Signed on behalf of  the Committee :                                              HALIFAX, Chairman.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,    February 17, 1937.[14602]c    (/)  The McGowan scheme has had a favourable reception in the industry,which is prepared for legislative action of a fairly drastic nature, and most goodtechnical opinion in its ranks has for some time been pressing for reform.  If theposition remains uncertain, undertakers will delay or fail to carry out necessary,but perhaps expensive, extensions, particularly in rural areas.  We feel that inthe interests of producers and consumers alike, the industry should be  given assoon as possible a clear indication of what its future is to be.
APPENDIX A.                     DETERMINATION OF PURCHASE PRICE.(A) Local Authorities.    In the case of a local authority undertaking, the purchase price would be thesum of the following items :     (1) The  amount properly expended on the physical assets suitable to, and           used for, the undertaking at  the date of  transfer,  with  any duly           authorised capitalisation of interest, less  depreciation in accordance           with a scale to be scheduled to the Bill.    (2) The  outstanding liability in respect of preliminary expenses, costs  of           change of system or voltage,  and hire purchase balances  due from           consumers;    (3) Stock and stores to be taken over at valuation.The purchase money should be applied as follows :--     (a) in  discharge of  outstanding loans and  other liabilities;    (6) in  reimbursement  of any net amount contributed  to  the  electricity           undertaking from the local rates;    (c) any balance  remaining after application as at (a) and  (b), together with           investments or  cash balance of the undertaking, to be used for the           benefit of electricity consumers or for further electrical development           in the area of the transferred undertaking.    This is in accordance  with  an ingenious recommendation of the McGowanCommittee.   It was  considered inequitable to give  as purchase price for  a localauthority undertaking less  than a sum representing a &quot;fair value &quot; of the assetsbut in some cases this would be  a  sum greater than the outstanding  debt of theundertaking.   In  the special circumstances,  we consider this departure fromprecedent to  be justified.(B) Company Undertakings.    In the case  of  Companies, the purchase price  should  be the sum  of  thefollowing items :     (1) the amount properly expended on the physical assets suitable to and used           for the undertaking at  the time of transfer,  with any duly authorised           capitalisation of interest, less depreciation in accordance with a scale           to be scheduled to the Bill;    (2) compensation for loss of future profits  during the  unexpired  period of           the franchise of the vendor company, provided that,  in  calculating           future profits, the financial  control to which the company  would have           been subject if it had remained in existence is taken into account;    (3) a reasonable allowance  for outstanding liability for cost  of change of           system or voltage, and hire purchase balances due from consumers;    (4) stock and stores  to  be taken over at valuation.(C) Arbitration Tribunal.    An arbitration  tribunal should be set up by the Lord Chancellor to settle the matters referred to above and any  other  question which may arise betweenthe parties as to the  amount of the purchase price.
        NEW POWERS  OF  CONTROL OVER AMALGAMATED UNDERTAKINGS.    If reorganisation  of  distribution proceeds on the basis we recommend, theCompany Undertakings  which  are retained  will  possess consolidated  andmonopolistic powers to supply in  enlarged amalgamated areas.  They will alsopossess a greater security of franchise than at present owing to the abolition ofthe powers of purchase of the local authorities in the amalgamated areas and the consequent removal of the liability  of the undertaking to be split up by piece-mealpurchase as under present-day conditions.    In the  interests of the public and of existing and potential consumers  ofelectricity in particular, it is  necessary that there  should  be adequate controlover the operations of  these consolidated undertakings, so as to ensure that  theycarry  out their  obligations to develop the  supply of  electricity  in the mostadequate manner and on the most economical basis.    To  this end further powers of control would be required by the ElectricityCommissioners in respect of the following matters :       (i) Power  to approve of  the form and terms of all new capital issues of the        .  retained company undertakings.                   This is to  ensure that all new capital is raised on the best              possible terms to the benefit of consumers of electricity.     (ii) Power  to impose an  effective sliding scale, fixing the relation between          prices and profits of the retained company undertakings,  and to revise          such sliding scale at recurring periods of, say, three years, where there          has been anjr material change  in  the relation between  the  various          classes  of supply for which standard  prices had been fixed or in the          circumstances under which the Companies were operating.    (iii)  Power   to  require   all  undertakers  (both  Companies  and  Public          Authorities) to offer a  statutory two-part tariff of an approved  type          for domestic supplies which shall be available as an alternative  to          a flat rate charge at the consumer&apos;s option; and power to revise such          two-part tariff from time to time.                   This power should  also  be coupled with  a  further power              whereby, on any revision of authorised maximum prices, separate              maxima may be fixed, or separate methods of charge imposed.in              respect of the different classes of supply.    (iv) Power  to  require  all   undertakers   (both  Companies  and  Public          Authorities) to  submit  for approval, from time to time, schemes for          the provision of distributing mains in uncabled streets, or  for the          extension of electric lines into undeveloped parts of their areas;  and          power to require the carrying out within a  reasonable  time of  any          approved schemes  which will not  substantially affect  the  general          financial position of the undertaking.                   This power should be coupled with a further power whereby              undertakers can be required to offer facilities  for the hire  and              hire-purchase of apparatus and assisted  wiring schemes, and  to              establish showrooms.    (v) Power  in appropriate cases to  modify an undertaker^ requirement of          a guaranteed gross revenue of 20  per  cent,  in  relation  to  capital          expenditure before carrying out an extension, or to dispense with such          requirement.    (vi) Power to  require adjoining undertakers to enter into arrangements for          mutual assistance for the various purposes indicated under Section 19          of the Electricity  (Supply)  Act, 1919, so  as  to make the Section a          permanent provision instead of a transitory provision as at present.APPENDIX  B.
APPENDIX  G.      REPORT  OF MCGOWAN COMMITTEE ON ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTION.           Summary of Vieivs of Interested Bodies or Individuals.(A) Representatives of Municipal Authorities.    1.  Association of  Municipal Corporations criticises  the  Report on thefollowing points of principle :     (a)  There are strong objections to any departure from the general principle           of the public ownership of electricity undertakings.    (b)  Local authority  undertakings should not be  transferred to companies           unless it can be shown that  consumers will  benefit and unless that           object cannot be achieved by any alternative method.    (c)  Local authority purchase rights  should  only be suspended where action           is demanded on strong grounds of public policy.    (d)  The basis of purchase for local  authority undertakings should be the           same as for companies; and local authorities should not be bound to           apply any surplus (after payment of outstanding debt) to the benefit           of electricity consumers.    (e)  Strong objection is taken to the different procedure  for undertakings           selling less than 10,000,000 units.  All schemes should be provisional           and not become operative unless confirmed by Act of Parliament.   All           local authorities, whether undertakers or not, should be entitled to be           heard at a public enquiry and to have a right Of appeal to Parliament.    2.  Urban District  Councils&apos; Association. Maintains in  effect that the considerations  which the District Commissioners should take into account in preparing a scheme should be clearly defined by Parliament.  They object to anyproposal which would not give all undertakings,  regardless of size, a right ofappeal  to Parliament  or  to  some  tribunal  independent  of  the  ElectricityCommissioners; they also  object  to the  proposed basis  of purchase for  localauthority undertakings.    3.  Convention  of Royal Burghs. The Convention are of  opinion that itwould be  &apos;&apos; a retrograde step &apos;&apos; to give effect to the proposals contained in theReport of the Committee, and that any attempt to carry out these proposals would meet with strenuous-opposition from  the  Burghs of Scotland.(B) Representatives of the Industry.    1.  Power   Companies&apos;   Association. Leading   representatives   havesupported the Committee&apos;s recommendations, as being   eminently practical and progressive.&quot;    The General Manager of Edmundson&apos;s Electricity Corporation  (which&quot;ownsor  controls the  undertakings  of  six  Power  Companies)  also supports  theCommittee&apos;s recommendations subject to modifications to provide for     (a)  Tenure in perpetuity by  Company undertakings.    (b)  Pooling to secure uniform prices.    (c)  The appointment of a  Tribunal (instead of District Commissioners) on           lines similar to the Railway Rates Tribunal.    2.  Conference  of  Small  Electricity  Undertakings  (i.e.,  Sales under10,000,000 units). This  conference  (which represents  small company  under-takings as well as small local authority undertakings)  exjDressed strong objectionto the unjustifiable and inconsistent differentiation made in the McGowan Reportagainst undertakings with an output which  does not exceed 10 million unitsper annum, and stated that they viewed with alarm the implications of theMcGowan Report;  in the  interests of the development and  expansion of thedistribution industry, it is essential that all efficient  existing undertakingsshould be retained.
