IN Cabinet paper 269 (36) of the  20th October, 1936,  I set out  fully thearguments at that time for and against a temporary suspension of Jewish immi-gration while the Royal Commission were  at work and their  report was underconsideration.                                                    .         .    2.   It may be convenient if I repeat an explanatory passage from that memo-randum regarding the policy and procedure for the regulation of immigration into palestine :          &quot; The policy of Government in regulating immigration into Palestine is;    in brief,  that immigration shall be regulated  according to the  economic    capacity of the  country to absorb  the  immigrants who  are admitted.  The    legislative expression of this policy is the Palestine Immigration Ordinance    of 1933, which consolidated and amended previous Ordinances.  Under this    Ordinance the volume of  immigration has consisted  for  the most part  of    immigrants in three categories, namely&apos;:          (1)  Capitalists  with   at  least  1,000  (Category  A (i))  and   their               dependants;        (2)  Immigrants with  definite prospects of employment, entering  under               the labour schedule (Category C), and their dependants;  and        (3)  Dependants  of  persons   already  legally  resident  in  Palestine               (Category D).        &quot; There are several other categories of immigrants under the Ordinance,    but most of them are at present closed for economic reasons and, where they are    not closed, the immigrants  are admitted on financial guarantees of persons of    institutions in Palestine competent to give those guarantees.  The great bulk    of immigrants into Palestine are, of course, Jews, but the provisions of the    Immigration Ordinance and its regulations make no distinction between Jews    and others as  regards their admission into  Palestine, except  in so  far  as    special machinery is provided to facilitate the entry of Jewish wage-earners    under the labour schedule.        &quot; The labour schedule (Category  C) is determined  by the  High Coni-    missioner half-yearly in April and  October.   The practice is for the Jewish    Agency  for Palestine to submit to the Palestine Department of Migration a    reasoned estimate of the number of immigration  certificates required for    Jewish  wage-earners throughout  Palestine  during the  coming half-year;    This estimate is checked by the Department of Migration in the  light  of    information based on its  own independent  enquiries,  and after  further    discussion between representatives of the Department and of the Agency a    recommendation  is made by the Commissioner  for Migration  to the  High    Commissioner.  On this recommendation the  High Commissioner takes hia      [14752]
     decision, having regard not  only  to  factors bearing upon the immediate     requirements for the half-year, but upon considerations of longer range in     so far as he may consider them to be relevant.   It is, however, important to     stress the point that the considerations involved, whether of short range or of     longer range, are purely economic considerations.  On reaching his decision     the  High  Commissioner causes the Jewish  Agency  to be informed of the     number  of certificates under the labour schedule which will be placed at their     disposal  for -the  half  year.   This  information is  also  published in the     Palestine Government Gazette.  As might be  expected, the Jewish Agency     has  always shown a tendency to take a more optimistic view than the  Palestine     Government of the requirements of the Jewish labour market in Palestine,     but  although  the  High  Commissioner^ decision has  often  enough been     received by the Jews with disappointment and expressions of criticism, I     have no reason to think, that responsible Jewish opinion has  at  any time     regarded the High Commissioner^ decision as being influenced  by considera-     tions other than economic ones.  Frequent statements have been made by my     predecessors to the effect that it is for the High Commissioner and not for     the  Colonial Office to fix the figure.&quot;     3.   At  their meeting on the 28th  October,  1936, the Cabinet accepted my view that there should be no change in policy and no suspension of immigration for political reasons,  and that a limited labour schedule should be granted for the half  year October, 1936 to March,  1937.  The number fixed for the labour schedule  was 1,800, which  included  a  special allotment of 300 certificates  to provide  for  registration as  immigrants of the German Jews in possession of a Capital of  1,000 already in Palestine, who would have been unable at that time to transfer from Germany  the  qualifying capital.within a prescribed period  of twelve months.  I attach as  an  appendix to this memorandum the announcement which  I made in the House of Commons on the 5th November, 1936.     4.   The question now  arises as to the labour  schedule which  is due  to  be issued  next April for the period April to September 1937.  At first sight it would seem logical  to follow the same line as  was adopted last October, and so far  as concerns  immigration under categories  other than  C, there can, I  think,  be no doubt that that should be allowed to continue in the normal way. But as regards category  C, the position in April, 1937, will be different from that in October, 1936, in one very  important respect.   In my  statement of  the 5th November, 1936,  I said that His Majesty&apos;s Government  had decided that a temporary suspension of immigration would not be justifiable on economic or on other grounds; and that it was the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government that if any drastic departure from the immigration policy  hitherto pursued were then to be introduced  in advance  of the findings of the Royal Commission that would involve an alteration in the  existing situation, and might  be held  to prejudice the enquiries of the Royal  Commission, which would be directed,  among- other matters, to  the very important question of immigration generally.  As things are  to-day, we  know that the  Royal  Commission have  directed  their  minds  in  the course  of  their enquiry  in Palestine  to  this question  of immigration and to  the  principle ofeconomic absorptive capacity, which has governed Jewish immigration into Pales-tine  since 1922.   We do not know what the Royal  Commission may recommend on this subject, but we  do  know  that  their report may be ready  next April. (The middle  of April is the earliest date by which Lord Peel expects to have itfinished.) In these circumstances, the  High  Commissioner has represented to me that, in his opinion, it is the wisest and most equitable course  in this period of uncertainty  to.postpone issuing a  labour schedule for the six months, April to September of this year, until a decision can be taken in the light of the report of the Royal Commission.    5.  I am  in  agreement  with the  High   Commissioner&apos;s view,  and  i accordingly recommend that I should be authorised to instruct the  High  Com-missioner (1) that while the preliminary work for the determination of  a labourschedule  for  the six months April to September of this year should proceed in thenormal way, no schedule should be issued pending the decision of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment   which will be  taken  in  the  light of the recommendations of theRoyal Commission; (2) that  immigration under categories other than C shouldcontinue  in the normal way.                    ..               - -
     6.  If this recommendation is approved, it will be necessary for some public statement on the subject to be made.  I  should propose  to  arrange at  an appropriate time for a question in Parliament,  in reply to which I should state the instructions issued to the High  Commissioner, making it  clear that these instructions do* not represent, and are not to-be  regarded as  involving,  a changeof policy, but that, as the Royal Commission&apos;s  report may be presented to HisMajesty&apos;s Government-some  time in April,  His Majesty&apos;s Government considerit advisable in all the circumstances to defer the issue of the  labour  schedule,which would normally be issued in April,  until they have  received the report and can consider the matter in the light of any recommendations which the RoyalCommission may make.

APPENDIX.         Secretary of State&apos;s Announcement in the House of Commons,                             November  5, 1936.     On  the 19th June and  the 22nd July I  informed the House  that  His Majesty&apos;s  Government could  contemplate no change of policy whatsoever with regard to  Palestine until  they had received  and considered the  Report of the Royal Commission.  On the 22nd July I also said that, as regards the suggestion that there should be a temporary suspension of immigration while the Commission is carrying out its enquiries,  I was not at the time in  a position to make any statement as to the intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government beyond saying that their decision would be taken  in due course on the merits of  the case.     As the House is aware, the Royal Commission is leaving  for Palestine to-day and His Majesty&apos;s Government have carefully considered whether or not there should be  a temporary suspension of immigration while  the  Commission is carrying out its enquiries.  They have decided that  a temporary suspension of immigration would not be  justifiable on economic or on other grounds.  It is the view  of  His Majesty&apos;s Government that,  if  any drastic departure from the immigration policy hitherto pursued were now to  be introduced  in advance of the findings  of  the Royal  Commission, this would involve an alteration in the existing  situation, and might be held to prejudice the  enquiries of the Royal Commission, which will be directed, among other matters, to the very important question of immigration generally.    At the same time, His Majesty&apos;s Government hava thought it right, in the present circumstances  obtaining in Palestine, to ask  the High Commissioner to take a conservative view of the economic absorptive capacity  of the country.  He has accordingly recommended that the six-monthly Labour Immigration Schedule, which was due to be issued last month, should be fixed at 1,800 certificates; this recommendation has been approved by His Majesty&apos;s Government.  This figure compares with a Schedule of  8,000 in April  1935; 3,250 in  October 1935; and 4,500 in  April  1936.    The new Schedule of 1,800 certificates includes   a  special allotment  of 300 certificates to provide  for registration as immigrants of the  German Jews in possession of a capital of   1,000 already in Palestine who will have  been unable, as yet,  to transfer  from  Germany  the  qualifying capital  within a prescribed period of twelve months.  The  total increase, therefore,  in the Jewishpopulation resulting from this schedule will not exceed 1,500. It will be appre- ciated, however, that immigration is not  confined to those persons who receivecertificates under  the Labour Schedule.   The categories under which  other immigrants enter are as capitalists (that  is to say, persons in possession of notless than  1,000) and  dependants of such capitalists, of persons  authorised  toenter  under the Labour Schedule, and of  persons already resident in Palestine. Taking into  account all forms of Jewish immigration,  it is expected  that the total for the six months from  October 1936 will be substantially below  that for the preceding six months.
