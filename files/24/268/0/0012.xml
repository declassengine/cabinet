SECRET.f^P. 62(57).OAIEDONIAN POWER ORDER,  1937.PRODUCTION OP CALCIUM CARBIDE.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.1.   Having  regard to  the raw materials used, the manufacture of calcium carbideprima facie  is  ideally suited to South Wales, and there are the strongest reasons why we  should wish it  to be located there.   In spite of all the energy and time which has been  spent by the late Commissioner, the present Commissioner, theSouth Wales Development Council and other-agencies and by the Government itself,in trying to get new industries started there, the results so far have been disappointing.   This  is particularly true in respect of the location of new factories for defence  purposes.   Lancashire, which is not a Special Area, andthe Scottish Special Area have fared much better in this respect than South Wales.2.   In support of the proposal to locate the new works at Corpach inInverness-shire, the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence and the Secretary ofState for Scotland draw attention to the high percentages of unemployment inRoss and Cromarty,  Caithness and Sutherland, and Inverness-shire, and comparethem with &apos;the percentage in Glamorganshire.     On this I would point out that:-     (l) The percentages quoted include females.   If men only are included thepercentages become  35^ for the three Highland Counties and 32;o for Glamorganshire.     (2) The total  number of insured men in the three counties mentioned (and inArgyllshire, which  is nearest to the site of the works) is 28,000 and the totalnumber in Glamorganshire and Monmouthshire 386,000, or nearly 14 times as many.The total number of men unemployed in the four Scottish Counties is 9,600, oralmost the same as  in Merthyr Tydfil alone, and under l/l2th of the correspondingtotal (120,000) in  the Welsh counties.    The area of the four Scottish Counties(9,000 square miles) is &amp;g times that of the Welsh Counties.     (3) Owing to  the distances, the nature of the work, and the fact that very many of the Highland unemployed are crofters or fishermen only a small  proportionof them would be likely to be engaged.    They would be suitable for the mostpart only for the unskilled work,  and experience shows that the contractorswould engage as far as possible Irish navvies,  many of whom would stay inScotland afterwards.
      (4) I am informed that the British Aluminium Company at Kinlochleven are-undertaking extensions, which vdth other road works are likely to absorb allthe local labour.3.   The water-power scheme will involve heavy constructional work, with consequent demands dn materials and skilled labour (including building labour),and the building of the&apos; houses for the new township will also require building trade workers.   It is unnecessary for me to emphasise the unde sir ability of adding in any way to the requirements of building labour in Scotland, which arcalready causing a situation of acute anxiety to the Secretary of State and myself,4.   From what I have said above, I think it is clear that from the point ofview of unemployment and labour supply, as well as the particular needs of theSouth Wales Special Area, scales are heavily weighted in favour of that area.There are,in addition, other factors to be taken into account, upon which I am not in a position to offer an expert opinion, though I venture to suggest thatthe position is not so free from dohbt as the British Oxygen Company seem to/show in their memorandum.5,   First, as to raw materials.    The necessary anthracite must in anycase be obtained  from  -South Wales.   The limestone, I understand, theCompany propose to get from their quarries in North Wales.    There seemsto be some doubt whether supplies of suitable limestone are available insufficient quantity in South Wales - but to the extent that they are, theycan be used.    The Company admit in their memorandum that savings on thetransport costs of these two items, anthracite and limestone, which i submit must be considerable comparing the transport to, say, Burry Portwith that to Fort William, would &quot;help to equalize the Power Costs.&quot;It would be helpful if we had comparative figures of the transport charges to, say, Burry Port and to Corpach, on the assumption that thewhole of the limestone comes from North Wales in each case.
 6.   Next  - as to the  supply  of electric power.   The Company say that they can generate electricity at  Corpach at a cost of .1117d. per unit, whereas the best price they  have been able to get so far in South V/ales is .18&amp;. per unit, and that  the difference is such that they cannot manufacture carbide economically in South Wales without a subsidy of the order  of  100,000 per annum  (on a production basis of 100,000 tons).  These are matters for experts, but I am told by Sir George Gillett that his expert advisers are inclined to think that the cost per unit at Corpach has been underestimated, and that power could be supplied by the grid in South Wales at less than the figure of .18d.  said to have been quoted by the i3ir John Power Station.   If this is so,  we might well find that the margin of difference could be so much reduced that it could be offset altogether by the possible savings mentioned in the previous paragraph - and no subsidy would be necessary at all. 7.   Finally,  as to the requirement of a Port site, I am informed that Sir James Milne of the Great Western Railway does not share the British Oxygen Company&apos;s view that no suitable site exists in South Wales.  In his opinion Burry Port provides a first-rate site of the kind required.Although Burry Port is not strictly within the Special Area of South Wales, it is in Glamorganshire,  only just outside the boundary of the Special Area,  and a factory there would undoubtedly attract labour from that area. 8.   I must confess that,  taking all the foregoing factors into account, I do not think the Company can be said to have made a convincing case for their scheme.    It seems to me that there are a number of items in their account which ought to be submitted to expert examination before we accept them,  and I am free to confess that I share the dpubts expressed to me by the Commissioner as to the unbiassed nature of the Company1s enquiries in South V/ales.    I also share the concern of the Secretary of State for Scotland about unemployment in the Highlands - but I doubt very much whether,  having regard to the causes of that unemployment  and its seasonal nature, the proper treatment for it is an attempt to industrialise a scattered rural population.   It seems to me that we ought                                 3.
                                                                     IS 4to hesitate a good deal before  we support a scheme of this kind,  costing 3,000,000, if there is a practicable alternative which can be carriedout in a thickly populated area with an industrial tradition.   As a scheme in South Wales would not involve anything like the capital expenditurerequired for the Corpach scheme, such an argument cannot of course except to receive the support of the engineering interests which are said to bebehind the Corpach scheme.9.   I should add that if the Scottish Scheme is rejected by  theHouse of Commons I see no reason why we should fear that we should be compelled to concede exorbitant demands for a factory in South Wales;  onthe contrary I should anticipate that the Company (or some other  Company)would then find it possible to make proposals on a more reasonable basis&apos;,and I do not gather from the memorandum of the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence that our requirements are so urgent  that thenecessary time cannot be allowed for this.                                   (Intd.)  E.B.15th February,  1937.
