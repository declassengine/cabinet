Memorandum by  the Minister for  Cs-Ordination of  Defence.       In the course of a discussion  on  the defence programme at a Cabinet Meeting held on Wednesday,4th November, 1936, the Secretary  of  State for ForeignAffairs expressed some anxiety as  to  the date to  which our programmes were working.   He  felt that the positionought ts be examined in the light  of  the possibility ofa challenge any time from the Soring  onwards?  and hesuggested that the Cabinet should  have before  them a clear picture of our strength next May with reference tothat of other Nations.   As a result, the Cabinet  agreed(Cabinet 63(36) Conclusion 3(b)) that I  should consider what further information (i.e. in  addition to what hadbeen said at the Meeting by the  Service  Ministers) shouldbe prepared for the Cabinet when they came to consider further Foreign policy and Defence.       In accordance with the above Conclusion, I  asked the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee  to  prepare information on the following lines:-

PART ^INTRODUCTION.    IN accordance with  the  conclusions reached  at  an informal meeting  heldon the 9th November under the Chairmanship of the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence,* we have been instructed to report on the comparison of the strengthof Great Britain with that  of certain other nations as at May 1937.  As agreed at the meeting referred to above, the information required has been prepared onthe following  lines :     (a) Assumptions.         Germany and Italy  hostile, and France  and Belgium in co-operation    with us.  Russia to be taken in alternatives, either a neutral or co-operating    with us.t    (b) Form of Paper.     (i) An estimate of  the  armed  strengths by  sea, land and air of all the          nations concerned  as  at May 1937.    (ii) The likelihood of the assumed Powers considering themselves ready for          war to be assessed on the basis of (i) and other factors such as the          output of war material in the various countries by the dates mentioned,          and the  general  economic situation.PART II. RELATIVE STRENGTHS OF THE ARMED FORCES AS AT                                 MAY 1937.    2.  The strengths of the forces of the nations we are considering are shownin detail  in Appendices I,  II and III.   A mere statement of  the  estimatedmilitary strengths  and weaknesses of these nations does not, however, clearlyconvey the value of their armed forces in the event of war.  Other factors/suchas the state of the land fortifications and the physical conditions in the possibletheatres of war have a bearing upon the military situation.    We have, therefore, summarised the military aspect as a whole and under conditions of two  different  political situations,  i.e., Russia  as  a neutral and russia  as our ally.    3.  In respect of naval forces, France and Great Britain will have a greatsuperiority in capital ships and will possess 6 aircraft  carriers as against noneby Germany  and Italy.  In other respects also we shall have the advantage asthe following figures show :     In our opinion such a marked superiority should enable us to exercise decisiveeconomic pressure in a prolonged war.    4.  On land  Germany and Italy will possess  numerical superiority, but although by May 1937 Germany may be able to put 39 divisions into the field onthe first day of war, there will be a shortage of Corps and Army  troops and the    *  Paper No. C.O.S. 525.    f  In view of the recent &quot;defence  agreement&quot;  reached between  Germany and Japanexpressing their mutual animosity towards Communism, we have felt bound to take account ofthe probability that Russian  intervention against Germany might in turn  lead to japanese intervention against Russia in the Far East.RUSSIA NEUTRAL. France andGreat Britain.Germanyand Italy.Cruisers ...DestroyersSubmarines 92196132 31144120[14476]B 2
training of the troops is  unlikely to have reached a high standard.   Moreover,assuming that Germany  is a  potential aggressor,  she  will  not  have either  asufficient number of divisions, or the tank units and artillery, necessary to under-take an  offensive  against France and  Belgium  with a reasonable prospect ofsuccess.  Whereas in May 1937 the French defences will be complete (except thosealong the Franco-Belgian frontier) and  the  Belgian defences will  already beformidable, the German system  in the  Rhineland would  probably  only becomparable by then to the Hindenburg line in 1918.      ;    For these reasons the German General Staff&apos;are unlikely to consider that thestrength of the German army  is sufficient to justify the prosecution of a landoffensive.    5.  In  the south, Italy  could  in all probability mobilise more divisions than she could employ,  since the mountainous nature of the country on the Franco-Italian border limits the  forces which can be deployed.    France&apos;s  fortifications upon her  German frontier and the mountains on herItalian frontier in fact present military obstacles of a strength which make anyrapid  German or Italian  success  on land  unlikely  under conditions  to beanticipated in 1937.  France&apos;s equipment and maintenance problems are likelyto limit the armies she  can  maintain over any considerable period of fighting toa total strength of some 40 divisions, and Great Britain will be in no position torender her material  assistance  either in the form of troops or equipment.    6.   In  England the re-organisation and re-equipment of  the army will havereached  a  stage at  which not more than two  divisions could at first be  sent overseas; and it is highly probable that the whole of this force will be requiredin the Mediterranean area.   Here Italy could employ land forces in  operations against French and British  interests  in North Africa.  Although she might have more formations equipped suitably  for a  desert advance than she had in 1935,her sea communications would  be  insecure, and this factor  would probably limit the size of the forces she could maintain in this area.     7.   It would, therefore, appear that  for a  variety of reasons, none  of theabove countries, considered individually, will be in  a position by May 1937 to embark on a major land offensive with any great prospect  of success.     The strengths of  Germany  and Italy  will, however, both  be more thanadequate to maintain.a defensive  strategy by land.     8.   A comparison  of air strengths shows that  it is iii respect of this partof their military forces that Germany  and Italy are likely to have the greatestadvantage over France and Great Britain.  They will not only be considerablysuperior in first-line strength, but  will have an exceptional advantage where long-range bombers, which are of particular value for exploiting the initiative in airwarfare, are concerned.  In combination the German and Italian aircraft of this type will possess a disposable  weight of  attack  of some 1,000 tons of bombs asagainst approximately 300 by the French and British.     9.   If  Italy  were- to decide to support an attack upon  Egypt with herMetropolitan Air  Force she would be in a position  to reinforce at will her airforces in Libya.  Britain and France, on the other hand, would have no effective means of reinforcing Egypt to  a comparable extent, and consequently Italy could obtain a great measure of  air superiority locally.   It  is doubtful, however, if italy could or would divert a large portion  of  her Metropolitan Air Force toLibya if, at the same time, the French and British bombers were to attack Italianindustrial centres in Northern Italy.  Italian vulnerability in  this area is  such that she would be  almost bound to stage a counter-attack against the French andBritish  air organisation in order to supplement her local defensive measures.Italy might be more willing to despatch  a large proportion of her bomber force to combine with the German bombers, in an attack on  Great  Britain, since  it isupon the success  of any  such  attack that the ultimate situation in Egypt will depend.  Italian bombers operating  from Germany would, however, suffer fromadministrative and technical  difficulties  similar to those which are likely toattend our own air  forces when operating from Continental  bases.     10.   It is, however,  conceivable that a combined  air  attack on a scale of600 tons of bombs  a day at maximum intensity or 200 tons of bombs for sustainedattack  could  be staged against Great Britain  in May 1937.  This  is a heavy
scale of attack and its results cannot be predicted with any certainty.  Providedtne British people&apos;s moral was sufficient to withstand air attack, the main dangerwould  arise from progressive destruction of our resources.     if, however, lor  any reason Germany and  Italy were forced into declaring war, it would appear that it is only  in air power that they will possess an advantage sufficient to offer any chance of a quick success.   We have, therefore,indicated above the scale upon which such attack might be developed.               RUSSIA AS AN ALLY OF FRANCE AND GREAT BRITAIN.     11.  The  following are  the principal additional  forces  which  Russian intervention would introduce:       One hundred and eleven submarines (most of which are stationed in the Far East);  a force of  17 divisions  immediately, rising to 42 divisions within a week and to something like 100 in three months; 2,950 first-line  aircraft,  exclusive of those specifically earmarked for operations east of Lake Baikal.     12.  It  is important  to  note,  however,  that with the exception of her submarines, and about 530 of her longest range bombers, Russia could not employ any of  these forces against Germany or Italy without  violating neutral territory, unless,  of course, the intervening States were themselves already in the war.  The attitudes of  the  Baltic States, Roumania, Czechoslovakia,  and  particularly Poland, are, therefore, of great importance in assessing the value of  Russian military assistance  to France  and Great Britain.  Moreover, we cannot ignore the probability that Russian intervention on our side might lead  to Japanese support for Germany and Italy.  Such  an occurrence would  have far-reaching effects upon the naval situation.     13. On  the  hypothesis  that  Poland  and  Czechoslovakia  would remain neutral, Russian intervention would have little immediate military value for us, since her aircraft would have no means of attacking Germany without violating Polish  neutrality, except by indirect flight via the Baltic.  By this  route the distance from  Russian  territory  to  Berlin is about 780 miles.   In these circum- stances even Russia&apos;s long-range bombers, whose operational  radius  of action is  about 850  miles,  could  not bring any  considerable pressure  to bear  upon Germany.     14.  With Czechoslovakia friendly, which is a possibility  under the Mutual Assistance Pact of 1925,  the  air situation  would be improved.  Nevertheless, Germany and Itaty might conceivably deny Russia the use of air bases in Northern Czechoslovakia by means of a land advance.   In these  circumstances, the 530 long-range Russian bombers would provide the only effective means of air attack in the initial stage, and, apart from administrative and supply difficulties, these aircraft would have to violate Polish or Roumanian neutrality in order to reach their advanced bases.     15.  It is  only if Poland is friendly and willing to co-operate that Russian intervention on behalf of France and England can quickly develop into a real menace for  Germany.  In these circumstances,  Russia could  soon develop the whole weight of her air attack,  and would also be presented with the opportunityof advancing on a wide front suitable for the deployment of her large armies.     16.  We have drawn attention to the effect which the  attitude of Poland and Czechoslovakia would have  upon the military value of Russian intervention so that there shall be no misconception regarding the immediate results  likely to follow Russian intervention.  The great numbers of Russian aircraft should prove a serious threat to Germany in the East in a war of long duration,  as some meansof exploiting them would no doubt be found in course of time.  But under theconditions contained in  our terms of reference Russian air forces  could initiallyexert little effective pressure on Germany.    17.  With regard to the naval aspect, the  important question  is whetherassistance from Russia  would  result in  hostilities against Japan.  In such an event, the situation would be as follows : 
    18.  We could send a fleet to the Far East adequate in heavy ship strengthfor a defensive strategy,  while retaining sufficient strength at home to counter the German forces.   In cruisers,  however, after meeting the needs of the twofleets,  we should have  a  serious deficiency  for  work on  the  trade  routes, and considerable reliance would have  to be placed on the armed  merchant cruiserswhich we should take up on the outbreak of war.  The forces required for our home and  Far  Eastern  Fleets  would  leave  nothing  available  for theMediterranean, where we should have to rely upon the French fleet to deal withItalian naval forces  and dispute the  control of  sea communications to north africa.  If the  situation envisaged in this  paragraph  arose, it is doubtful,however, whether the  French fleet would  be able to reduce  communications between Italy and Libya to such an extent as to prevent an increase in the probablescale of attack against Egypt.    19.  From the naval point of view, therefore, Russian neutrality is infinitelypreferable to Russian intervention, if there is any likelihood of the latter leadingus into hostilities against Japan.    20.  We conclude that, from  a  purely military point of  view, the value ofRussian intervention is doubtful,  especially if it is likely to be  accompanied byJapanese hostility.  In any event, unless Poland in particular is an ally, thedevelopment of anything approaching Russia&apos;s  full strength against germany is a matter of great difficulty, and consequently, from our point  of view, we cannot expect to obtain much relief from  Russian intervention  until some time has elapsed.  Nevertheless,  we feel certain that Germany fears the military threatwhich would ultimately result if she were to take action which would inevitablybring in Russia against her.  This factor, therefore, constitutes a powerful moraldeterrent against Germany going to war.PART  III.-LIKELIHOOD OF  POWERS CONSIDERING THEMSELVES                   READY FOR WAR  IN  MAY  1937.    21.  In reviewing the probable strengths and efficiency of the armed forcesof the Powers, we have  already considered how this factor might influence theirviews as to their  readiness for  war.  In the following paragraphs  we reviewadditional  factors which would be  likely  to  influence these  views.   We have-briefly considered the economic situation, but it is important that this should beregarded as a most  uncertain factor.  As we have already shown,  conclusionsbased on the terms of  reference  for this paper might have  to  be considerablymodified  if other countries  such  as  Poland or Czechoslovakia abandoned theirattitude of neutrality.    22.  The present political situation makes it unlikely that  any of the powers which we have assumed as  our  possible  allies would initiate  a war.   There is greater danger that Germany or  Italy might be  the aggressor.   We thereforeexamine in greater detail the possibility that either of these two countries might consider  itself  ready for war than  we devote to those countries which might become our allies.                                 GERMANY.A rmed Forces.    23.  Apart from the actual comparison of strength in 1937 and its bearing on German prospects of success, Germany, in judging the advisability of riskingwar in May  1937, will be influenced by the way in which the comparison of strength is likely to alter within the next few years.  Although in 1937 germany will be able to mobilise fewer divisions than  France, by/1939 she is likely to havea marked superiority.  The possibility that in the,,same  interval of time the contingent which Great Britain could send to the  Continent will have increased from  two to five divisions is not likely to outweigh the importance of numericaladvantage over France in the eyes of the German General Staff.    On the other hand, in aircraft,  Germany will probably be as far ahead ofGreat Britain in 1937 as she will ever be.   The re-equipment  and expansion ofour Air  Force between 1937  and 1939  should  do much to  remedy the  great,disparity in size  and offensive power which  will exist in 1937.
    Although there have been indications that in some quarters the belief is held that success in war can be achieved by the exercise of air power alone, there is noproof that this represents German military opinion as a whole, and however muchcertain opinion in this  country, conscious of our vulnerability and the state ofour defensive preparations, may doubt the issue, it does not follow that germany is prepared to risk  a war in which her hope of success  would depend almostentirely on the action of her air force.    In  considering  her prospects of success  by means  of  air  warfare only,Germany must take into account possible  action by  Russian air forces.   the threat of Russian air attack developing  from bases in Czechoslovakia or Polandis ever present in Germany&apos;s thoughts.    24.  The  comparison of strengths which we have made has shown that the intervention of Italy on  Germany&apos;s side would  give the German and Italiancombination superiority in  numbers  of  divisions and, particularly, of  bombing-aircraft.  Apart from the doubt which we have already expressed as to whetherthis superiority would be judged sufficient to assure German-Italian success, theGerman  General Staff is believed to have little trust in the reliability of Italianpromises of intervention.   They would probably oppose any policy likely to precipitate  war in 1937 if  that policy could only be  justified by reliance uponItalian co-operation.Economic.    25.  At sea our superiority over Germany would be very great, and we wouldbe  able to  develop effective economic pressure  against her, even were Italy herally.  Our  position in this respect would be strengthened  by  the intervention ofRussia, since so long as that country remained neutral she would be a potential,though improbable,  source  of supplies  for Germany.  Germany is,  therefore,unlikely to  embark on a war under  conditions in which she cannot foresee good prospects of gaining a quick and decisive success.Industrial.     26.  In 1937 the German output of armaments, already very great, may bestill increasing,  whereas the recent measure  of &quot;nationalisation&quot;  which theFrench have adopted will not have  had time  to take effect.   In Great Britainthe output  of war material will still be on a low scale.  In  two or three years&apos;time  our  output will  have  much increased,  and  in  emergency  should be considerable.  For these reasons Germany might feel that in  1937 her industrial position for war would be stronger in comparison with that of her  potentialenemies  than would be likely a few  years later.Conclusion.     27.  Germany is unlikely to plan to go to war in  1937 since at that time her military forces will be far from completely ready. If she were faced by a suddenemergency in which the possibility of going to war on her western frontier hadseriously to be considered, her military position on land would be a factor tendingstrongly to dissuade, whereas her military position  in the air and in relation to industry would be factors which might encourage her.   Economically, however,she must seek a quick decision; and so long as she expects to meet the  combinedstrength of France and Great Britain she must doubt whether her advantage in air power will be sufficient to promise a  quick result.  We may certainly  beconfident that unless assured of whole-hearted co-operation on the part of Italy,Germany would  have no military justification for War.                                    ITALY. /(rmed Forces.     28.   Italy will still  be  faced with  considerable military and  economic commitments in  consolidating her  position in  Abyssinia.  If&quot; war  did occur, Italy&apos;s threat to our interests would require the presence of considerable naval forces iil the  Mediterranean, and it would be  necessary to reinforce Egypt  with military and  air forces to counter possible Italian  attacks from Libya.  If war broke out before we had moved our reinforcements to the Mediterranean,  they
 might have  to be limited initially to such units and equipments as could be conveyed in His Majesty&apos;s ships, or moved by air or land via Iraq or by land and river via East Africa.  Apart from the fact that Italian military forces will be better equipped in the spring of 1937 than they were a year ago, the progress which her propaganda has made throughout the Middle East might result in any Italian  military success  being accompanied by  serious  trouble for  us in the Mohammedan world.   Although the greater  part of her air forces might be engaged on  the Franco-Italian front, Italian  air  forces  could outnumber  those of the Allies in the Mediterranean, where, from the air point of view, she occupies an extremely favourable strategic position.     29.  The attraction which the possibility of initial success against us in the Mediterranean might have for Italy would, however, be qualified by the knowledge that permanent ascendancy in that area would depend on the ultimate outcome of the war.  Her decision whether to go to war would probably be governed by her judgment of the probable final result  rather  than by the attraction of an ephemeral success.     30.  Italy is vulnerable to air attack from France, particularly  in her northern provinces, where the majority of her industries are located.  Although the prospect  of French air bombardment might not deter Italy from going to war if she saw  prospects of  a  quick decisive success, the possible crippling of important industries would necessarily  influence her if she were considering a long war.  Moreover, although she has built up some 3 to 6  months&apos;  reserves of armaments (less  aircraft) in Italy, Africa  and Abyssinia,  as a  result  of the 1935-36  mobilisation of her industries, these reserves would only assist her for a limited period in a short war. Economic.    31.  Italy&apos;s economic position is likely  to be the factor which would  most strongly  discourage her from going to war in 1937.  She could not face restriction of her imports on the scale which would result from joint action by Great Britain, France and  the U.S.S.R.  (which she  would  have  to  anticipate)  for long. Consequently, Italy, like  Germany, is not likely to embark on war unless she sees a prospect of quick victory. Conclusion.    32.  We conclude that Italy is unlikely to want  war in 1937.  If  war is initiated by  Germany, it would  be in  keeping with the character of Italy to attempt  some  form  of  blackmail before  irrevocably committing  herself  to co-operation with Germany.  If, however, she thought she could rely on Germanyto defeat Great Britain,  she herself  would  be only too pleased to exploit thiscircumstance in the Mediterranean and North-East Africa.    For  Germany, the importance of Italian co-operation would be greatest     (a) in containing French army and air forces on the Alpine  front;    (b) in  diverting the  British  Navy  from  full  economic  action  against          Germany;    (c) in reducing the likelihood of early British participation on land in France          or Belgium, owing to the probable necessity for reinforcing the Middle          East.                           FRANCE AND  BELGIUM.    33.-  An attempt to assess  the readiness of France and Belgium  for war in1937 by balancing the theoretical arguments which might govern their decision might be misleading.   Both countries are quite determined not to seek war.   if France had meant to fight a preventive war against Germany she would have done so before now.    34.  There is  ample evidence that the position in France, and particularlyin Belgium, in regard to war reserves is bad.  The nationalisation of  the Frencharmaments industry has been initiated and aircraft firms are being redistributedthroughout France to reduce their vulnerability to air attack; but these measures
of reorganisation are only being begun now.  As regards  the French armament industry,  the industrial unrest during the latter part of 1936 will render theposition in 1937 considerably worse than it otherwise would have been.  Also, theprocess of transition to nationalisation will further tend to reduce efficiency.  Thestate of the Belgian armament industry is worse than that of the French; war reserves are very seriously deficient, and the fact that the  bulk of the,armamentfactories are close  to the German frontier makes it impossible to rely upon their output in war.  In 1937 neither France nor  Belgium is  likely to obtain muchoutside assistance  as regards supplies of munitions.   At the same time,  Franceis growing doubtful about the reliance she can put upon Belgian co-operation.These factors constitute no encouragement to France to seek war.    35.  Against these considerations may be set the fact that Fretich mobilisa-tion in 1937 would enable her to put a greater number of divisions  in the fieldthan Germany, whereas, by 1939,  this will no  longer be the case.  France must also consider that her fixed land defences are now relatively as strong as they areever likely to be,  and looking ahead she may foresee the danger of militaryencirclement by three dictator Powers.  None  of these considerations, however,is likely to carry sufficient weight to  persuade  France to consider the Spring of1937 propitious for war.                                              -    36.  Belgium&apos;s attitude is always  purely  defensive.   The recent statementof her policy indicates a desire to keep clear of commitments and guarantees, andto preserve her neutrality in a war in the West of Europe.  At the same time,Belgium  is engaged in putting her defences in order,  and if she completes this,her&apos;chances of  remaining neutral, which from the military point of view is toour advantage,  will be increased.   If attacked, both France and Belgium would almost certainly fight.Armed Forces.    37.  Although the U.S.S.R.  has very great man-power  and large stocks of equipment, it is doubtful whether her military staff would consider her organ isa-tion sufficiently developed to enable her to embark on an  offensive war  with confidence.  The Soviet forces have as yet made little progress in tactical trainingwith the modern arms which they have acquired.  The munition industry whichhas been built up is still young and  might not prove capable of maintaining themaximum forces  that she can mobilise, and the transportation  system  of thecountry has not yet been modernised and would be likely to break  down in war.The rebuilding of the Soviet Navy is still in its infancy.    38.  The public statements of the U.S.S.R. that she is ready to fight on bothher Eastern and Western fronts  at the same time should not therefore be  inter-preted as an expression of her immediate readiness for war.Economic and industrial.    39.  The  TJ.S.S.R. is reported  to hold considerable reserves  of armaments and aircraft for her army and air force.  Although there is an enormous so-calledreserve of &quot;observer pilots,&quot; practically the whole of the  personnel reserve isvery poorly  trained in all respects, and in consequence it is  considered that theRussian  Air Force  would rapidly  deteriorate  when  it began to suffer heavy casualties.  This weakness is giving the Russian Staff much  concern.  Interven-tion in a war  in which Germany, Italy and, possibly, Japan would be engagedagainst her would entail the loss of all the foreign trade normally passing throughher Baltic and Far  Eastern  ports,  and interference with her  Black Sea ports.Her foreign trade is, however, on  a small scale even in peace; and, provided thatreserves of certain minerals had  been accumulated  in peace,  the prospect of theloss of such trade would not be likely to deter the U.S.S.R. from war.  Plans are believed  to exist for forming these reserves, but we  do.not know to what extent they have as yet been accumulated.U.S.S.R.[14476]c
                        PART  IV.-CONCLUSIONS.    40.  Below we summarise  the conclusions reached in this paper.in relationto the situation, as we foresee it, in May 1937.      (i) Great Britain, France and Belgium would be much stronger at sea than           Germany and Italy,  and  would  be able to  exercise considerable           economic pressure.  Neither Germany nor Italy is  likely to be in a           strong financial or economic position, and the allied pressure would        :   probably reduce them both to a very weak condition in the course of        j-  a long war.   It is therefore unlikely that Germany or Italy, either        &apos;   singly or in  conjunction, would  embark on war unless they believed           that they could achieve  victory quickly.     (ii) The German Army will not have either the numbers,  equipment or        :   training  to justify  a belief that she could overrun France quickly.        ;;  Even with the co-operation of Italy on the Franco-Italian frontier        ; &apos;  she would not be justified in anticipating a rapid decisive success on           land.    (iii) There is at present no definite evidence of a preponderance in German           military circles of the view that success can be gained solely  by  the           exercise of air power.  Nevertheless, if internal difficulties should force        I   her leaders to consider war as  the only alternative to loss of prestige,        I   they might decide to gamble upon the effect of air attack.  The scale      ;  I   of her attack in 1937 would be considerably lower than that of which           she may  be capable in 1939, but, on the other hand, she is probably        ;   aware of our heavy deficiencies  in  modern bomber aircraft and  the           backward state of our air defence measures of  all kinds.     (iv) The intervention of  the U.S.S.R., while Poland and  Czechoslovakia        ;   remained neutral, would confer little immediate benefit in the Allies&apos;           cause.  If Germany  and Italy believed themselves justified in counting    &apos;      upon a quick decisive success against France or Great Britain the fear           of Soviet intervention would not therefore necessarily deter them from           war.      (v) Although Italy might  consider that  alliance  in war  with Germany           against  Great Britain would give  her  great  opportunities  in  the           Mediterranean, particularly if Japan too wrere on her side, she would           realise  that  the.  retention of  any conquests she might make would           depend on the ultimate result  of the war. She would  not, therefore,           be likely to go to war on prospects of ephemeral success, but would be           governed by her  judgment as to the  ultimate  results.

NAVAL BASES.Bases.    1.  i Germany has no bases outside her home waters, and Italy none outsidethe Mediterranean  except in Eritrea and Italian Somaliland.  Our bases are adequate for war against Germany and Italy with the exception that we require an Eastern base in the Mediterranean, for which purpose facilities will have tobe improvised  at Alexandria, as was  done in  the  recent  Italian crisis.  Nodocking facilities, howrever, are available at this base.  As regards local SeawardDefences,  those for Rosyth and Scapa Flow will be completed by  March  1937 :those for other ports will only be partially completed by May 1937.   The situation as regards facilities at Singapore is as follows : Singapore.. Base.. (For details regarding state of defences see page 17:)    2.   Under the Naval Deficiency Programme Singapore Dockyard should becompleted, from the construction point of view, by the 1st April, 1939; the presentAdmiralty policy is to maintain (the dockyard on a peace-time footing from thatdate onwards.   By a peace-time footing is meant that the  dockyard should inpeace-time be capable of docking: and undertaking refits of 9  cruisers a year.    It cannot be said, however, that the peace-time status of the dockyard willexist before 1940, since it will  probably  take approximately one  year  from thedate of completion to get the dockyard functioning properly.  -  The dockyard should be capable of  expansion from its peace-time status tothe full war-time requirements within a period of six months.    .,Situation in May 1937&apos;.                                             ....    3.  Repairs. The work that could be carried out in the Singapore Dockyardin May- 1937 would be limited! to very &quot;minor repairs&quot;  since little  of themachinery will have been installed in the workshops by that time.  However, withthe aid to! H.M.S. Resource and: the facilities of Singapore Harbour Board, thenormal work of maintaining a moderate size fleet at Singapore could be met, but no. after! action repairs could be carried out, nor could any purely naval work inthe nature of gun mounting, firej control work, alterations and additions,  &amp;o, becarried out.                     ;                       .&apos; .
                                       US    4.  Docking. The present position as regards docking in the event of thefleet having to operate from Singapore is fairly satisfactory. The only dock under construction in the approved programme is an Admiralty dry dock (capable of taking any existing ship) which will be completed by September 1937.  Until thisdock is available, however, the only dock in the Singapore area capable of taking a capital ship is the Admiralty floating dock at Singapore.    There are  at  Singapore a number of  commercial docks  belonging to the singapore Harbour Board capable of docking cruisers, destroyers and submarines.There is also a  small dock at Penang which can dock destroyers and submarines.Under a skeleton programme which has been prepared to allow for the dockingof the British main fleet under conditions of a Far Eastern War, all destroyers and submarines and a certain percentage  of cruisers are  shown as docking inthese  commercial docks.Anti-aircraft ammunition for H.M.

This table should be read in conjunction with  the notes on each  country which aregiven in the following pages, since the comparative value of a division depends upon its state oftraining and equipment.NOTES     (&apos;)  Includes 3 armoured divisions.    0)  Mobile Division (Chasseurs Ardennais).    (3)  Includes 5 Alpine, 3  mechanised and 3 mobile divisions.    (*)  Includes 2 Alpine and 5 motorised divisions.    0)  Includes 2 mechanised divisions.    (6)  Includes 20 active, 5 mobile, 20 1st  Reserve and 8 Colonial divisions.   Though Francecould, mobilise her 53 divisions it is doubtful whether she could maintain more than 40 for any length of time.   (Vide paragraph 30 of this Appendix.)    (7)  These figures would be modified if U.S.S.R. were simultaneously fighting in Far East.(Vide paragraph 34 of this Appendix.)    (8)  Includes 25 2nd Line divisions.                  COMPARISON OF LAND FORCES, MAY  1, 1937.     1.   In Table  B we have made a comparison of the  land forces of the  sixPowers with which this paper  deals as we anticipate they will be in May  1937.In tabular form this comparison can give only a rough  indication of comparativestrengths;  the table  is therefore followed by notes giving greater detail aboutthe condition of the land forces of each Power.GREAT  BRITAIN.Personnel and Equipment of the Field Force.     2.   The maximum force which could be  mobilised in the United kingdom for service overseas, whether on the Continent or in Egypt, would be one corps of two divisions and ancillary troops, including one A.A. group.     3.   Equipment. This force  may  have one Light Tank  Battalion, but  inMay 1937 units  will  be deficient  of  the  following  percentage  of  modernweapons:                                                                   Deficient                                                                 Percentage.

    4.  Reserves. Reserves of modern weapons would be totally deficient andammunition for the weapons specified in paragraph 3 will also be deficient.    Field artillery ammunition sufficient for 90 days&apos; operations on the Continentwould be available for the two divisions and their supporting artillery, but duringthis  period no further  reserves of  ammunition would  be  available  for. anyformations. For operations elsewhere, e.g., in the Middle East, this ammunitionwould be sufficient for a longer period than 90 days.    5.  Personnel. The two divisions could only be mobilised at the expense ofthe other regular formations in the United Kingdom.Other Regular and Territorial Army Troops in United Kingdom.    6.  Two other regular divisions will be in process of reorganisation, but  one infantry brigade from one of these divisions may still be in Palestine.    The headquarters and infantry brigades of a fifth division will exist, but the auxiliary and  ancillary  troops  required  to complete  the  formation to  the equivalent of one of the first four divisions are deficient, and the third  infantry brigade is already included in the first contingent as  Line of Communicationtroops.    7.  The Mobile Division. Of the two mechanised cavalry brigades, one willbe in  process of reorganisation and completely unfit for war.  The other  will stillbe horsed and will not have started mechanisation or reorganisation.    8.  The  Tank  Brigade  will  be  equipped  with medium tanks which  areobsolete and unfit for  war, but  the light tank battalion will be equipped with modern light tanks for which reserves will  be available.    9.  The only Army Tank Battalion will not be equipped  for war.   The first of the remaining 3 Army Tank Battalions will be about to form,  but will have noequipment.    10.  One A.A. Group will be below war scale in personnel and equipment. :    11.  Twelve  Territorial  Army divisions will be  much under  strength, willpossess  no modern equipment and will be entirely deficient of  war reserves ofmany kinds.Air Defence of Great Britain.    12.  Units. Of the 76 A.A. Batteries authorised, 61 will have been formedand 15 will be under formation.    Of the 108 A.A. Searchlight Companies authorised,  95 will have been formedand 13 under formation.   All units will probably be under strength.    13.  Equipment. Of the 608 3-inch A.A. guns required, 180  complete withCase  III gear and instruments should have been  delivered, leaving  a deficiency of428 guns.    Of the 2,547 searchlights required,  511  should have been delivered, leaving a deficiency of 2,036 searchlights.    The above equipment will be largely dispersed  amongst the units to  give them  adequate  training  facilities.   In  an emergency there would  be about100 guns available for the defence of the London area and about 350 searchlights.The latter would suffice to complete the present Inner Artillery Zone  (approxi-mately  a radius of 10 miles from Charing  Cross) and sectors  of the  AircraftFighting Zone  to a depth of some 15 miles round the north, east and  south ofLondon.    Elsewhere  at ports and in the industrial areas there would be  about 80 gunsand  150 lights.  These  could probably best be distributed  to  form &quot;token&quot;defences at the various places for which defence is provided under the A.D.G.B.scheme.Coast Defence  of Great Britain and Ireland.    14.  Existing close defences will be comparatively satisfactory, but a gooddeal of the ammunition will be obsolete.    The new defences which it is proposed to install at Scapa and Invergordonwill not be ready, and only a few ports will have anti-motor torpedo-boat defences.    None of the counter-bombardment  defences will  have been modernized.

(a) The following garrisons will existGibraltarMaltaEgyptSudanPalestine. 2 battalions. 2 battalions, and 1 Maltese Volunteer battalion.( 6 battalions. 2 mechanised cavalry regiments. 1 horsed   cavalry  regiment   (in  process  of        mechanisation). 1 mixed tank battalion. 2 battalions. 6 to 10 battalions, according to the situation.(b)  Coast defences in the Mediterranean will be manned on Lower Colonial      Establishment, and  would require reinforcement from the United      Kingdom to bring them up to war strength.(c)  The A.

The  proportions of the approved scales of war reserves           which will exist in Gibraltar and Malta in May 1937 are as follows :            Gibraltar.               Ammunition for coast defence guns complete, but all 9-2-inch and           6-inch is of obsolete type.               Ammunition  for  the  4 3-inch A.A.  guns,  80 per  cent, of           approved scale.               SAA. complete.               Anti-gas respirators provided for all military personnel, but not           for civilians.  No decontamination stores.               Defence scheme stores 75 per cent, complete.               Food, 30 days reserve for garrison.           Malta.               Ammunition for coast defence guns complete, but all 9-2-inch and           6-inch will be obsolete type.               Ammunition  for the 12 3-inch AA.  guns 24,000 rounds  new           type e complete.               S.A.A., considerable surplus held.               Anti-gas respirators held  for all  troops plus  10 000  for civil           population.  Bleach  and ointment for  30 days.   Protective clothing           for decontamination parties.               Ordnance stores for war practically complete.               Food, 60 days for garrison and anticipated reinforcements.  For           civil population, meat for 50 days and bread for 83 days.    (e) The coast defences  at  Haifa will be in position, but ammunition  and           personnel to man them would have to be found from elsewhere.    (/) Personnel and coast defence equipment for defence of Port Said and Suez           will be available, at short  notice, from  Malta, but  any  personnel           supplied by Malta for this purpose would have to be replaced.India.    16.  Apart from the Covering Force and Internal Security Troops, the field army consists of four divisions (mixed Indian and British Units).

Australia could produce two infantry brigade groups for garrison,dutyby about Z  4- 37 days, and New Zealand and Canada could also produce  smallforces for garrison duty, if required, in about Z  4- 2 months.    Larger contingents, fit  to  take the  field, would  not  be  ready beforeZ -f 6 months at the earliest,  and  would be  dependent on  United  Kingdomresources for a great deal of their equipment.  Approximate strengths would beas follows :     Canada. One cavalry division, two divisions and corps troops.    Australia. One cavalry brigade, one division.    New Zealand. One mounted rifle brigade,  one infantry brigade group.                                  GERMANY.     23.  The 39  German  divisions,  being permanently at  approximate  war strength, should be ready to leave peace stations on Z -h 1 day,  but there will stillbe a shortage of corps and army troops for a force of this size.     By May 1937 it is anticipated that the equipment of the 39 German divisionswill be completed.  Owing to a shortage of trained officers, the training of these divisions is still likely to fall far short of the standard which the German GeneralStaff would consider necessary for war.     There will probably be reserves of equipment sufficient to equip five additional-regular divisions above the 39 now in existence.     24.  Unless German construction of heavy tanks  has already been  carriedout in secret on a large scale, she will not in  May 1937 possess tank units of a typeor in the numbers necessary to give her a prospect of breaking through the Frenchor Belgian  frontier fortifications by means  of A.F.Vs.     25.  In addition to her thirty-six regular  infantry divisions Germany  will,by May 1937, have  made  some progress in organising reservists into  certainelements of thirty-six reserve infantry divisions.     These  reserve formations will probably  be built  up progressively,  and by may 1937  they may have  reached a stage at which  reservists will have  been allocated to form some 108  reserve infantry regiments.   These regiments, thoughorganised on paper, will only have assembled  and trained as units  in exceptional cases.  Considerable progress will have been  made towards forming the  furtherunits necessary to constitute reserve divisions, but it is  not anticipated  that these will have received training as formations.
                                   ITALY.    26.  The speed with which Italian divisions could be mobilised in May 1937will depend on the extent  to which personnel called up in connection with the abyssinian war are retained with the colours. The figures given in Table  &quot; B &quot;assume that no change in Italian policy will be made between now and then.    27.  The armament  of  the   Italian  Army  is  thoroughly modern and considerable reserves are held.    Owing, perhaps, to the mountainous character of Italy&apos;s land frontiers, herscale of anti-tank weapons is  abnormally low, and her  tanks, though  numerous,are of a very poor type.    28.  Since the Autumn of 1935 the number of mechanised divisions in Italy has been increased from one to three, and  an &quot; auto-mechanised brigade&quot;  hasbeen formed, consisting of cyclists and motor-cyclists carried with their cycles inlorries, thus increasing their radius of action.    If the possibility  of (Italian attack  against Egypt from Libya  again aroseItaly would therefore have improved equipment  at her disposal compared withthat of 1935.                                  FRANCE.    29.  France  relies for much of her  strength in defence against  Germanyupon her fortifications, which cannot  be expressed in terms of  divisions.  . this factor  is not fully represented in the tabular comparison of forces. Her defenceson the  German frontier are already complete and, although those on her Belgianfrontier are likely to be  still further strengthened, her  defences as  a whole are probably at their peak of effectiveness.    30.  Without industrial assistance from some other Power France could not maintain the 53 divisions which her man-power and initial supplies of equipment would enable her to mobilise by Z -f 21.  It is doubtful whether she could maintain a force of more than 40 field divisions for any length of time.    It seems unlikely  that France  could in 1937 count on  industrial  help fromany foreign Power; we cannot, therefore, be certain that she would  mobilise thefull 53 divisions.                                  BELGIUM.    31.  Of the  12 infantry  divisions  which would  be mobilised  by Z  -f 4,6 would be reserve formations which would be of limited fighting value for thefirst few weeks of their embodiment.    As, however,  a  second batch of 6 reserve divisions will be  mobilised  and available for garrison duties in the rear and for the construction  of field defences,all the 15 divisions  shown in  Table B will  be actually available  for  active operations.    32.  Like France, Belgium  relies  upon  fortifications as well as  field forma-tions.   Their fortifications at Namur,  Liege and Antwerp,  although not as.formidable as the French Maginot line, are of considerable strength and are  linked up by a system of concrete machine gun posts behind water obstacles. The defences.between Liege and Antwerp may  not, however,  be complete by May 1937, but even so the Albert Canal defences will be reasonably strong at that date.  the canal  itself is expected to  be  completed  during 1937.    33.  The capacity of  the Belgian  armament industry will  still be  quiteinsignificant and she would have to rely upon outside sources for the supply ofarmaments if she mobilises her full number of divisions.    It is  difficult to see whence in fact Belgium  would be able to obtain thenecessary reserves in view  of the parallel shortage in England  and France andthe United States embargo on  the export of armaments to belligerents.                                  U.S.S.R.    34.  The numbers  of  divisions shown in Table  B would  be  modified ifU.S.S.R. was at the same time engaged in a war against Japan.   The number of divisions available for service  on her western front at Z -f  30 would then  be 75and at Z -t-  90, 100 if they could be transported there.

     35.   Although the Soviet army consists  for  the most part  of  cavalry and infantry equipped with horsed transport, considerable progress has been made inthe  development  of mechanised formations.   The whole organisation  is  stillapparently in a state of flux but the Red Army now possesses at least 6,000 tanksof all types, of which their Medium Christie is believed to be the best of its typein the world.     36.   Russia  is  developing  several unusual  features which are likely tocharacterise her land operations.     She is very &apos;&apos; gas-minded &apos;&apos; and has a complete organisation for  the offensiveuse of gas in war  which, despite her signature of the Geneva Protocol, she maybe expected to use from the outset.     She contemplates the use of &apos;&apos; storm &apos;&apos; aircraft for low-flying attack, by bombor machine gun,  against troops assembling for attack or upon  the march and against headquarters and communications.     She also trains aircraft and troops to land small mixed forces by parachutebehind  the enemy  lines.     The most intimate strategical and  tactical co-operation is visualised betweenland and  air forces.     The  Russian army is organised politically both to ensure the reliability ofthe troops and to carry out intensive subversive propaganda in occupied territory and in  the ranks of the  opposing armies.     Though no reliable estimate of the value of these features can be made theywill probably improve the previously low offensive value of Russian troops.APPENDIX III.TABLE C.

COMPARISON OF AIR FORCES, MAY 1, 1937.     1.  In Tables C and D we have made a comparison of the strengths of theAir Forces as we estimate they will be in May 1937 of the six Powers, with whichthis paper deals.  We have  separated the air  forces  into  these two  Tables inorder to distinguish to some  extent between the forces likely to be developed inEurope and those which would probably operate in the Mediterranean and north african area.  In addition to the tabular statement, we have included some noteswhich affect the employment of these forces and their efficiency,  particularly in sofar as Great Britain is concerned.     2.  The basis upon which these tables have been  compiled is that of theactual mobilisation strength which it is estimated the various countries could putinto the field after allowance had been made for the reserves  of personnel  andmaterial which it is their policy to set  aside at the beginning of a war.     3.  In respect of British air forces a war  reserve of some  150 per  cent.behind the first-line strength  has been assumed as essential, with the exception of fighters, which are based on  75 per cent., while  for Germany,  Russia  and Italyabout 100 per cent, has been allowed.  This is due to the slower  rate at  which theaircraft industry in Great Britain will be able to woi&apos;k up to an output sufficientto make good war wastage, compared with aircraft industries of greater capacity in the three former countries.     4.  Again, although the French have recently publicly proclaimed their faith in the strength and efficiency of their air force, the  actual facts remain more in accord with  the  picture presented in C.I.I). Paper No. 1247-B, and the figures given in Tables  C and D above were compiled after the most recent and carefulenquiries.     5.  As regards Germany, there  is  little to  add to the information  recentlycirculated  in C.I.D.  Paper No. 1265-B.  Her chief  weakness may lie in  thetraining of her pilots, but she has been carrying out intensive training under all
weather  conditions regardless of casualties in her endeavour to catch up withother countries.     6.   The Belgian figures given are those for her peace time first line strength.The British Air Attache reports that it is doubtful whether her true mobilisablestrength is as much as 75 per cent, of this figure.     7.   Italy will probably be equipped with more up-to-date aircraft than anyother western Power, but she will not be able to build up reserves of new equip-ment and expand at the same time.  It is probable that she will build up reservesbehind her  existing re-equipped units and transfer obsolescent  types to newlyformed units and colonies.     8.   Russia will have a  ponderous air force, although  new equipment will replace gradually the slower aircraft.  It is likely that the high first line strengthfigure would be reduced considerably after a few weeks of war and would stabiliseon  a very much lower figure than it  now is.  Transportation  and skilled labour1difficulties would probably reduce the present scale of attack to a lower level.              Equipment and Maintenance of British  Air  Forces.A t Home.     9.   The result of converting the  peace time strength of British Metropolitanfirst line strength into actual mobilisable strength is to reduce the Air Force fromapproximately 100  nominal to less than 60 actual squadrons, and it might at firstappear that if we were prepared to  do with less reserves, our first line strengthcould be correspondingly increased.     10.   This is not entirely true, since our supplies of some types of equipmentare only just adequate to  maintain  our estimated mobilisable  strength, andshortages would occur if we  endeavoured to operate a larger number of first line aircraft.     11.   Generally speaking, the supply organisation and  reserves of all kindsare sufficient to maintain the Metropolitan first line strength we have shown untilproduction  on a war scale has grown up.  The main exceptions are as follows :       (a)  At the best only one ammunition depot will be available, and there will           be no parks in existence.     (b)  We shall have practically no gas bombs nor will our gas spraying devices-           have been put into production.     (c)  There will be a  severe  shortage  of bleaching powder,  and  anti-gas.           measures generally will not be satisfactory.     id)  The majority of our aerodromes  will be &quot;unprotected&quot; and  satellites           will not be fully available.A broad.     12.   Since the types of  aircraft in overseas commands in May 1937 will,generally speaking, have a comparatively small carrying capacity and range, the stocks of bombs and fuel should prove adequate, though only H.E. bombs will beavailable.     As  at home, the chief deficiency will be in the anti-gas organisation, which is unlikely to be satisfactory in any overseas Command until the end of  1937 at theearliest.

There has been ageneral awakening of interest in all quarters and a promisingresponse from volunteers in most districts.  All reports indicate that this response is Increasing.? but some localauthorities and other concerns  of a national character aretending to curb their activities? due to uneasiness in regard to questions of financial liability.General Education of the public.2.     In six months&apos; time pamphlets and handbooks dealing with most aspects of Air Raid Precautions? from the personal protoct-ion of the individual to the problem of safeguarding vitalindustries and national services will have been published,,Indeed at the time of writing this work is almost completed andin the period envisaged above? the literature should not only bein the hands of all concerned, but time for study should have elapsed?  and a start have been made by them on precautionary measures in accordance with the action recommended.
 3.     In av-cu.ition to lectures unu Iiaiso-.. work  between inspectors and the local authorities,  whiau proceeds daily, adaresses will have been given throughout the country to the principal chambers of coheree - to architects,  engineers and kindred professions.    Further,  many of the larger- factories,  works  and ousmess  premises,  Doth in the  Metropolis and in  the  country will have been visitee ana advice ana assistance  tendered on Air  Raid Precautions,  both  to owners and managers. 4.      Public  meetings  are  attended  whenever possible  by responsible officials  of  this  Department  ana the answering of  general  questions has  proved a valuable means of-propaganda  and education, whilst  at  the  same ;time, it tenas to  disseminate information.    There  is  no reason to  believe  otherwise than that  in six months&apos;  time,  the  more serious minded section  of the  ;.-uulic at  any  rate,  will have appreciated  the necessity  for their  co-operation-  in the general scheme  of  air raid precautions.    The  con- templateu issue of  &quot;The householders Handbook&quot;  should also greatly help matters in this connection. Protection  of  the Public. 5.     The  three  chief  sources of aanger resulting  from air raids,  as they affect the civil population,  in  order of  priori&quot; appear  to be fire,  explosion and  gas.   This  is aue  to the three types of bombs likely to be use a by a potential enemy,  i,e. Incendiary, High Explosive ana Gas  (which might also be used  as spray). - 6.     There is almost  a  complete  answer  to  the problem  of                            &quot; gas, if preca.utiona.x-y measures  auvoeated  are properly carried out ana gas-proof rooms in houses  nd buildings are earmarked  in  advance.   In  addition, protection  to every  individual by respirator is planned.
7.     The maximum effort is being made at present towards theprovision of the necessary equipment.    The total requirements are600,000 service respirators for use of the most important local services, 900,000 civilian duty respirators for first aid personnel,air raid wardens, etc.,  and approximately 30 million civilianrespirators.   Approval is being sought appreciably to increase this number.   It is. hoped at the present rate of production that2h% of all types will become available by the end of May, 1937.Storage depots are being obtained and prepared to keep pace withdeliveries, and a scheme for their distribution is being worked out,8.     Owing to prohibitive cost, no forms of public shelters,proof against the direct effects of High Explosive Bombs, can becontemplated.   The Structional Precautions Committee now sitting,however, has the question under review with reference to theconstruction and planning of any new,  and the adaptation of old,buildings.   Instructions and information emanating from thisDepartment, legislate only for protection against blast andsplinters and for the safeguarding of individuals caught in the streets during; a raid.    Serious structural protection as regardsnew buildings, however,  can hardly have begun by May, 1937, even where it is agreed to adopt it.9.     The use of Incendiary bombs, as indicated above, isconsidered to be the most serious danger we have to face.   Aspecial division of the Home Office has been set up to deal withall questions of fire,  and&apos; it is submitting a separate report.Training and Recruitment of A.E.P.  Services.10.    Of necessity, the provision of gas instructors is limited by the facilities available for their education.   Only oneCivilian Gas School is at present in being with an annual estimatedoutput, in its enlarged form, of 900 trained instructors.   As,however, the number of instructors required throughout thecountry is in the region of 3,000,  increased facilities are vitaland a second School is planned in the North of England.   It isdoubtful, however, whether it could start to function before october, 1937, and on this assumption the&apos;required numberof instructors would not be available until the end of 1938,
The total referred to makes no provision for  replacements^ *or possible additional requirements and must, therefore,  he regarded as a minimum.   Priority on gas courses,  up to now,,has been given to the Police and by May, 1937 5  it isestimated that 80$ of the Regular Force (including Policefiremen) will have been trained by their own instructors,graduating from the School, and that a start will have beenmade with the Special Constabulary.   The London fire brigade and most of the important non-police Fire Brigadesshould also have been trained,11.     The personnel required for Air Raid PrecautionsServices i.e., Medical, Decontamination, Rescue Work, RoadRepair, Public utilities etc., (excluding police) all ofwhom must also be trained in anti-gas duties, is estimatedat a figure of 3?000 for a town of 100,000 inhabitants, butthis figure does not take in Post Office, Railways, Docks,Road Transport and Industry,   The magnitude of the task a tissue in regard  to training and recru&quot; tment  for Air RaidPrecautions Services is exemplified when it  can be said thatwith Metropolitan Boroughs counted as  a separate&apos;-town,there are over 120 towns in England and Wales with aminimum of 100,000 inhabitants.  A very considerable  time,therefore, must  elapse before anything  like  a state of readiness can be assured under this heading.  In six months&apos;time the most that can be said is  to  the effect that asubstantial nucleus of First Aid Personnel from the ranks of the British Red Cross and  St. John  Ambulance brigade and the St. Andrew Ambulance Association and the Scottish  red cross will have been trained but numbers, even so, must fall short of requirements..  A start will  also have been made inthe most important towns in the training of  volunteerpersonnel in.rescue and decontamination work and for use asAir Raid Wardens (A proposed new organisation from which much is hoped) but this training can only be in its first  stages.From industry and commerce little  appreciable results can beexpected, until  it is possible to  train instructors.                         -4-
Maintenance of Espential Public services.,12.    It is  difficult to envisage the future situation ofthe  three chief services (gas, water and electricity) since this will depend largely on the decision of the respectiveundertakings  as to  the financial liability involved,especially in the Metropolitan area where the necessity for alternative means of supply in an emergency may meanconsiderable  additions to plant.   The matter, however, isbeing given their closest attention.   As regards protectionof existing plant and personnel, limited precautions couldbe put into force at short notice.Main Line Railways.13.    The Railway Companies and the London passenger transport Board have formed a Standing Committee to ensureagreed arrangements are fully covered.   They have shownthat/they are prepared to co-operate by the training of personnel in  anti-gas and other duties, and by surve3;&quot;ingtheir systems and listing vulnerable points which may needprotection and buildings which could be adapted assplinter-proof or gas-proof shelters.    The training andsurveying is now in hand.    It is improbable,  however,that the Companies will undertake any structural workinvolving them in expense without some financial assistance.The necessity of maintaining services has been impressed on the Companies who, in the absence of precise  informationas to what&apos;damage is likely to be caused,  have expressedthe opinion that their organisation will be equal to anydemands made upon it.   The operation of services duringair raids and the passage of trains through gas  contaminatedareas will be the subject of further discussions in theimmediate future.
London Passenger Transport Boardo14.     The Board as shown in the previous paragraph,  are co-operating with the Main Line Railway Companies.   TheBoard is, however, confronted with a number of special problems, such as the protection of the tubes from the entry of sewage and water, a practical solution of which isnot likely to be found and carried into effect within thenext six months.Telegraph and telephone services.15.     Plans envisaged by the General Post Office will not materialise for some time, and although no doubt essential services could be maintained in an emergency, adequateprotections of offices, equipment  and personnel throughoutthe country cannot eventuate at short notice.  A sub-committeeon communication services is presenting a report in thenear future and is to recommend the establishment of asystem of Intelligence centres for the London area.  plans for the safeguarding of the B. B. C. and its installationsare quite well advanced.Inland Waterways.16.     A memorandum is being discussed with the undertakingsconcerned and should be issued within the next six months.The simple precautions recommended should provide reasonableprotection to their systems and their personnel.Protection of Docks and Ports.17.     A memorandum is about to be published and distributed to all the DOCK Authorities.  The port of London Authority,the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, the Manchester ShipCanal Company and the Port of Bristol should be in a positionto take limited.act ion in six months&apos; time.  The other ports in the country are not so far advanced in their preparationsand are likely to raise in some form or another the questionof financial assistance by the Government before they take any practical action.                   -6-
        A memorandum containing advice for precautionsfor the protection of wharves and quays will shortlyToe issued.  It will &quot;be possible to take limited action as recommended in this memorandum within six months.Protection of Factorieso18o     A few of the bigger firms in the country have prepared schemes of air raid precautions and the recentissue of a special handbook may be expected to inducea large number of other firms to begin to thinK about this subject.  Training and equipment, however, will notbe far advanced by May 1st.M edi c a 1 a r r an g em en t s.19c     In general Medical air raid precautions are ina very fluid condition, and little crystallisation canbe visualised in the period of time referred to atove.The provision of stretchers, the availability of efficient transport, and the collection of medicalequipment and stores are all being hastened, but without considerable financial outlay, no materialprogress must be anticipated within the next six months.The same can be said with reference to arrangements forthe decontamination of individuals and their clothingwhere delay  is being  experienced on the technical side.Real efforts are&apos; being made by local authorities to allocate the large number of hospital bedsthat would be required in an emergency, but even so,improvisation on a large scale will be necessary.  the selection of buildings  suitable for first aid require-ments and schemes for their adaptation progress steadily
intelligence and warnings.20.    By next Spring, the Oh server Corps should heorganised to the south and east of a line approximatelyfrom FLAMBOROUGH to YORK and YORK to BOURNEMOUTH, by which time it should be possible to operate a warning system to the civilian population in this area, and in a belt 50 miles tothe west of it, if Air Ministry arrangements for the initiation of such warnings are complete.   It is hoped toextend the system eventually to cover the whole country.A start has been made with the preparation of provisionalwarning lists of those who are to receive the warnings by telephone.General,21.    Experimental work continues side by side with thedevelopment of organisation.   The use of camouflage which includes smoke screening is being investigated in particularas an aid to protection.    Trials in various forms of warning apparatus for use in the London Area are alsocontemplated, whilst other trials in regard to the effectivedimming of street lights are actually in progress.   Theevacuation of slum areas in populous towns, the safeguarding of the large floating street population of the Metropolis,especially during the early evening, and the adequate protection of schools, are special problems of their owntowards the solution of which this Department has, and is,devoting the closest attention.    In these directions,however,  as in many others,  of which mention has beenmade, no appreciable progress must be expected within soshort a period as six months.22.    Certain proposals regarding the location of the  seat of Government have been formulated by a Sub-Committee ofthe Committee of Imperial Defence and are awaiting approval.                      -8-
CONCLUSIONS.23.    The degree of preparedness in Air Raid PrecautionsServices in the Spring of next year must depend, very largely in the first instance, on the availability of instructorsin anti-gas measures and the reaction of the public in providing volunteer personnel for the various services required-.   The general public, however, know.very littleabout air raid precautions and the conflicting reports oftenread in the press as to what is really being done must tendto confuse their minds and mitigate against their co-operationwith local authorities.   As stated previously in thisreport, a more general appeal to the mass of the people would tend to improve matters in this respect.&apos;24.    In other directions, it can be stated that by the spring of next year, limited precautions could be put intoeffect throughout the country, and if they achieve littleelse, they should be the means of allaying general panic,but no guarantee can be given that the life of the community and the business of government will not be disorganised.There is a great deal of ground to be covered and much to beachieved before any real degree of preparedness can be attained and this latter could not possibly be guaranteedwithin the next six months.25.    Despite the dangers of fire, a more re-assuringpicture could be painted if the use of gas as a weapon ofwar came to be eliminated.    The least of risks to whichthe civilian population would be exposed if properlyprotected, it becomes nevertheless the most costly and most difficult to legislate for in a short space of time.    Thisis due as stated previously to problems of training,  and tounavoidable delay in the provision of equipment.
26o     There is one final point to which reference must be made.  Apart from certain equipment which will hesupplied before-hand, the basis of the majority of- Air RaidPrecautions is that of organisation.  Material preparationscan only be made where there is a threat of an emergency,and although the degree of consideration varies almosteverywhere there are probably few local authorities inthe United Kingdom who have not sensibly progressed inwording out their plans.Air Raid Precautions Department,       Home Office^31st December, 1936.
