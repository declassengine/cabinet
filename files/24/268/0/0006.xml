COPY NO.  4-0.CP. 56 (37)                             CABINET6  Proposals  for amending the Teachers (Superannuation) Act,  1925,     and the Education (Scotland) (Superannuation)  Act,  1925.     Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland and  the               President of the Board of Education,,10            Representatives  of  the  Teachers&apos; Associations both  in    England and Wales and  in Scotland have  asked that  the  system  brought    into  force in 1935  in  respect of  the  Civil Service whereby a    pensioner may allocate part of his superannuation  benefits to his    dependents may be made applicable to  teachers pensioned under the    Teachers (Superannuation)  Acts or under the  Superannuation Scheme    framed in terras of  the Education  (Scotland)  (Superannuation)  Acts.    There is a widespread  demand  for  this arrangement  and  the  Treasury    have  agreed to the  terms on which proposals  might  be put before    Parliament.   No extra charge will fall on the Exchequer.2.            The British  Council have represented that the existing    limitations on the  treatment  as pensionable  of periods of  absence    abroad of British teachers are inimical to facilitating the    teaching of English and the spreading of English culture in foreign    countries.   The Treasury  have agreed to suitable  amendments  of the    existing statutes in order to remove  these obstacles.   It is not    expected that any charge will fall on the Exchequer.3.            The required legislation would take the  form of  an  agreed    measure;  and we desire the sanction  of our  colleagues to  the    introduction of the necessary Bill.                                                      W.E.                                                      0.FoG-.S.11th February, 1937,
