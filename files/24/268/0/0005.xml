C-JLBDOIIL.il POWER ORDER , 1937*                   PRODUCTION OF CALCIUM CARBIDE.           Memorandum &quot;by the Minister for Go-prdination of Defence.                A decision is required as to the attitude to he adopted           in regard to the scheme of the British Oxygen Company for           the erection of works for the production  of calcium carbide           and other materials, including ferro-alloys, at Corpach           near Port. William in the West Highlands.  The main item in           the cost of producing calcium carbide is electricity and the           Company&apos;s scheme at. Corpach is based on the production of           electricity from water power, which can be made available           there.           (2)  The Company,  last Session, promoted the necessary           private Bill for this purpose.  On Second reading, the House           of Commons rejected the Bill, though the Lord advocate, on           behalf of the Government, recommended that it should be read           a second time and referred to the appropriate Committee.  The           Company has again promoted trie scheme in  the shape of the           Caledonian Power Order 1937 and if, as may be expected, the           House authorities rule taat it is to be dealt with under Bill           and not Provisional Order procedure, a Second Reading debate           may be anticipated in the near future, either in the Lords or           the Commons, and members will expect some guidance from the           Government.           (3)  The principal grounds on which the Bill was objected to           last Session may be summarised as follows:-                (i)   that, if a new undertaking of this kind is to be                      set. on foot, the proper place for it is not the
        Highlands, but one of the Special or Distressed Areas, the        necessary electric power to be derived from coal and not        from water power;.   (ii) that works of the kind proposed will be very detrimental        to interests in the Highlands, in that (a) they involve        the diversion of Loch Quoich waters from the East to the        West Coast and may thus damage such interests as those of        the Burgh of Inverness; (b) the works will do serious        damage to salmon and trout fishings, to the holdings of some        thirty crofters, the best part of which, it was asserted, will        be submerged by tne raising of the water levels in the lochs        necessary under the scheme, and to the general amenities of        the district, and (c) that there was a dispute, not settled,        between the Oorapany and the County Councils concerned  (mainly        Inverness but also Ross and Cromarty) as to the valuation of        the Works for rating purposes and consequently the. amount        of rates which could fairly be paid by trie Company.(h)     The principal ground on which one Government, through  theLord Advocate, recommended tne House to accept, in principle,  theBill of last Session and refer it to the appropriate Committee, wasthat an adequate and easily accessible supply of calcium carbide isan essential requirement for the Services, especially the Air Serviceand that there is now no production of it at all in this country,thesupplies having to be obtained from overseas mainly from Norway(which, might be a dangerous sea passage) or from Canada(which  wouldbe long as well as, on some sections, possibly dangerous).  The same considerations apply to the production of ferro-alloys proposed underthe scheme, particularly to one of these, ferro-chrome, which  isof great Service importance and is not now produced at all in  thiscountry.     A secondary ground was tne desirability of establishing aconsiderable and permanent industry in the Highlands.  It was,thought ti. at the Company should have the opportunity                            -2-
 of  establishing in Committee their case on economic grounds against siting the work in a Special Area and that the other grounds of objection to the scheme were also matters which might very well be thrashed out in Committee.   The House of- Commons decided otherwise and rejected the Bill on Second Reading. (5)     In view of the importance from the defence point of view of the materials to be produced under the scheme, close touch has been kept with the Company since the Bill was rejected.        They have been pressed to go as far as they possibly can, without wrecking the scheme* to satisfy the various objections summarised under (11) paragraph (3) above.  They have accordingly made various changes in Hie scheme? and, in particular? have arrived at an agreement on the rating question which is likeljr to be acceptable to the County Councils concerned (though not to the Burgh of Inverness).   But, whatever the Company do, they will not reconcile the opposition. So  far as the House of Commons is concerned, I have no doubt the Bill will be defeated on Second Reading unless a very emphatic convincing statement is made by a Government smokesriian in  support of the Bill.   The combination of opposing groups will be formidable, Highland amenities, sporting interests, and the needs of the Distressed and Special Areas will all be, represented in the opposition.   The promoters moreover or those believed to be interested in the promotion are not well thought of.   In these circumstances it is most desirable to consider the case for the Bill and the possible alternatives.
(6)     As regards the Special Area objection  (i) inparagraph (3)), the present feeling in Parliament in favourof action in the Special Areas seems likely to make oppositionto the scheme on this ground even stronger than it was last session,,   The Special Area, the claims of which have &quot;been most strongly pressed of late in this connection, is SouthWales, since calcium carbide is made up of anthracite coal and limestone? the former of which must anyhow come from south Wales and the latter of which is alleged to be present there of suitable quality and adequate quantity for theproposed production of calcium carbide.,(7)     In&quot; these circumstances, the British Oxygen company have been very strongly pressed to consider favourably the diversion of their operations to South &quot;Vales and they are known to have given very close consideration to the matter.The results of this consideration are embodied in amemorandum by the Company dated the 28th of January a copyof which is annexed (Appendix A).     It will be seenthat the Company assert that the business cannoteconomically be sited in South Wales and that,  if for reasons of public policy it is to be so sited,  very special measures would require to be taken by the Government,  muchmore far-reaching,  as I understand,  than anything at present contemplated under the general scheme for attracting industryto the Special Areas0(8)     One point arising on the memorandum of the Companycalls for special notice.   It is possible that they might produce electric power themselves in South Wales at a lowercost than  that at which it can be obtained from the power
companies.    This possibility they have not,  it is understood,exhaustively considered,  but they are clear.that it would notin any event get rid of the appreciable advantage in cost ofthe Highland Scheme over a South Wales Scheme&quot;.(9)     In deciding what the attitude of the  Government tothe Scheme should now be, the following considerations arise:     (i)  Calcium carbide is an important element in our          defence requirements, as it is an essential material          in the manufacture of oxy-acetylene which is used          for the cutting and welding of metals.  Ferro-alloys          are similarly importantft    (ii)  The. manufacture of these products in this country          is, therefore,  very desirable inasmuch as it would          eliminate any rislc of supplies from overseas being          cut off in time of war.               In this connection it is pertinent to note         * that the scheme envisaged in the Caledonian Power          Order involves considerable engineering work - th^          British Oxygen Company are understood to estimate          that they could commence production in about          three years and be in full production in about          three and a half years from the time when work          beginso   Should however production be required          earlier than this for emergency reasons^ the          company consider that it could be .forthcoming          on practically the full scale within about          twelve months from commencement of the factory,          power for which- in that case would be obtained          from the grid,  the extra cost of this.          being a secondary consideration in emergency,,          It may be as well to add that
      should the need arise there would he no technical      difficulty in manufacturing calcium carbide here      in time of war? as was in fact done to some extent      in the last war.   The consideration of cost would      then presumably be secondary,  and the time required      to start production would not be less than six      month so(iii)  If the materials are to be produced here,  I am      not aware of any other firm with capacity and      claim to undertake the work equal to those      of the British Oxygen Company who have, for      example, a special interest in and knowledge      of the acetylene production for which the      calcium carbide is primarily required, who have      for some years intensively studied calcium carbide,      and who are of sufficient strength to make a      success of the whole of the operations. (iv)  There is no reason to doubt that the Company have      given fair and full consideration to the      possibilities of South Wales and have satisfied      themselves that under normal conditions it would      not be economic to start production there  and that      the Highland Scheme offers the only prospect of      production which  would be competitive for      instance with Norway in respect of calcium      carbide.  (v)  Unemployment is very heavy in  the Highlands,  the      percentage in November 1936 reaching 51.2  in Ross      and Crornarty and  37.9 in Caithness and Sutherland      as compared with  31,3 in Glamorganshire.    The
          reason for not  including  the Highlands  in  the          Special Areas scheduled under  the  Special  Areas          Act  is not the  degree  of  Unemployment hut  the          difficulty of applying the machinery of that Act          to this District.    The establishment of new          Industries in the Highlands and  Islands is urgently          necessary and the British Oxygen Company&apos;s Scheme          is the most promising  and important Scheme in  sight.          The  value of such proposals to the Highlands is          demonstrated by the  British Aluminium Company&apos;s          works at Fort Y/illiam  which employ several hundred          men  of whom 75^  are  Highlanders,,    (vi)  On the other hand? the need for  industrial          development in  South &quot;Tales is  great, while the task          of finding suitable  incVus tries is  difficult,,   The          anthracite required  for calcium  carbide manufacture          must come from  South V/ales and suitable limestone,          another necessary raw  material,  is also stated to          be available there.    That area  is therefore          indicated as suitable  for the  industry  as  the  late          Commissioner for the Special Areas stated  in his          report    The main difficulty arises from  the          difference in the cost of electricity derived  from          coal as compared with  water power, and  electricity          is much the largest  element in the cost of          production of calcium  carbide,.       From the defence point  of view, which Is my interest,I am compelled to the conclusion that the  scheme  ought on merits to be supported,  but I  fully realise  that,   on widerpolitical grounds,  my colleagues  may take  a  different view and may think it necessary that  the question should  be leftto the free judgment of the Houses  Government spokesmen                      -7-
       confining themselves to seeing that all aspects of the case       are fully presented.       (10)     !f*  as I should anticipate,  the result of the latter       course should again he the rejection of the Scheme,  it would       still he necessary in my opinion, to provide for the manufacture       of calcium carbide and ferro-chrome in this country.  The next       step would presumably be to see what are the bed rock terms       on which the industry could be sited in South Wales and to       decide whether the Government can or cannot consider them.       I should add that proposals, which I have seen from other       sources for setting on foot the production of calcium       carbide in Special Areas,  have been based on the principle       that the Government takes  all the risks of the business.       (11)     Reference should be made to one general consideration.       So far as can be judged on the materials at present available,       it seems reasonable to anticipate that the production of       calcium carbide, whether in the highlands or in South Wales,       would require tariff assistance.    Production in South Wales       would demand a higher rate of protective duty than production       in the Highlands unless the difference were made up by some       other means.    The British Oxygen Company are known to expect       that if they commence production here the existing suppliers       of calcium carbide will reduce prices in the hope of stifling       production and are assuming that a duty will be imposed on       imported carbide.    At present the Commercial Agreement with       Norway provides that calcium carbide shall be admitted free       of duty.    It is to be expected that when this Agreement comes       up for revision, Norway would strongly oppose any change in       this provision as  she sends us more than half our supplies       and the cheap water power  used in the production is one of       her chief natural  resources,    There would also be some       opposition to a duty from  industrial users of carbide other       than the British Oxygen Company.

APPENDIX A.  .                   . .  &amp; 6 IffilvlORAlTDUM BY THE BRITISH OXYGEN COMPANY.       The new Caledonian Power Order,  1937, has &quot;been framed after careful consideration has  been given to theobjections to  the former Bill.2,     The object of promoting- the Order  is to produce power for the establishment  of Electro-chemical  Industries.3.     The Electro-Chemical Industries  cover Carbide and thevarious products for which. Carbide is the  raw material andalso the ferro-alloy products  which are usually manufactured in furnaces alongside  Carbide.4.     The first principle of  t ;.e establishment of these industries is  their establishment on a  sound economic basis to enable them to compete on a fair  competitivebasis with any foreign production.5.  &apos;   The British Oxygen Company Limited  are satisfiedthat they can establish these  industries  on such a basisat Port William, Inverness-shire.6.     During the consideration of the Bill of 1936, and since that date, suggestions have been put forward that these industries should be established in a Special Area.7-.     The British Oxygen Company Limited have made a veryexhaustive survey of Special Areas and, in particular,South Wales.8.     The main points for economic establishment of theseindustrieo are;-       (i)  Cheap Power at Works      (ii)  Port Site for Works     (iii)  Access of Raw Materials to  Site      (iv)  Facilities  for delivery or  export                 of Finished Products.                       -9-
9,     Cheap Power is one of the chief elements in the cost ofproduction of Carbide, and, even to a much larger extent,in other1 Electro-chemical Products.       The alternative methods of production of Power are;-       (i)  Hydro-Electric       (ii)  Steam       A new hydro-electricity cost at Corpach has been .prepared by Mr. W. T. Halcrow, II. Inst. C.E. ,. our ConsultingEngineer, on the basis of the increased costs since our lastestimate was prepared, which brings out the figure of ,lllVd.per unit at Factory site.   A note is enclosed showing how this figure is arrived at,       We have also had a further meeting with the SwanseaCorporation, who are the owners of the Tir John Power station and we have a definite offer from them of Power, at a sitewithin the Swansea Corporation area, at a price of .2d. per unit for each unit up to and including 32,000,000 suppliedand taken in the year1, and at a price of . 18d.  per unit foreach unit in excess of 32,000,000.       The difference between our estimated Cost andthe lowest cost of .18d.  per unit quoted by the Tir JohnPower Station is, as you will see, 0.0683d. per unit, which,means 22.54/- per ton of Carbide, or  112,700 on our estimatedoutput of 100,000 tons.       It must also be appreciated that the units required inthe manufacture of ferro-alloys are from three to four times the amount used in the manufacture of Carbide,  and accordingly the manufacture of these alloys with Steam Power on the abovebasis would be an uneconomic proposition.       Various theoretical estimates of the Costs of Productionof Steam Power have been prepared, and from the data available,it is realised that there is a possibility of Power being
 produced  for the  undertaking,  at  a lower figure  than that at which it is at  present  produced in this country.    The lowest offer the British Oxygen Company Ltd,  have so  far received is that from the  Tir John Power Station. 10.     It is essential to  have  a Port Site for  Works,  as near as possible alongside Docks,  for the economical handling ofs-        (i)   Raw materials  for Carbide.       (ii)   Raw materials  for other Products.      (iii)  Finished Products  for Home and Export  Market, So far The  British Oxygen  Compairy  have not been able  to  find any suitable Port  factory  site,  to deal on an economic basis  with  the raw materials  for the manufacture  of Carbide. This applies also  to  the import  of raw materials  for  the manufacture of other  products.   These conclusions we  have drawn  after various interviews with the Dock  Authorities in South Wales, 11,      The raw materials  for the  production  of Carbide  are:-        (i)   Anthracite       (ii)   Limestone 12.      Anthracite of  the  required quality is available  in South  Wales,  and if a  suitable qualitjr and quantity of Limestone .were  available,  with reasonable  access to the  site of the Works,  any  saving would help  to  equalize the Power Costs. 13.      The  raw materials  for the  production  of the otherElectro-chemical Products,  however, are not available  in South Wales.14,      If  it  is the desire of the Government that theindustry should be  established in South Wales instead of inInverness-shire, it would be necessaryx-                        -11-
        (i)  To arrange for the supply of Power at under . 12d..            per unit, or, alternatively for a Subsidy to he            given of . 07c. per unit of Power used:, for a            long terra period.       (ii)  To arrange for a suitable Port Factory site being            available. .15.     The Commissioner for Special Areas stated in hisThird  Report:-        &quot;Another proposal.which would use available raw   materials, namely, limestone and coal, would be the   installation of a factory in South wales for the production   of  calcium carbide.   Further investigations of this   problem may be required, but preliminary investigations   made for me by a competent firm of engineers indicate   that the production of calcium carbide using electricity   generated from steam power is a commercial possibility, &quot;   The  Commissioner for Special Areas also stated in his first Report,  and repeated in his Third Report (paragraph18) that:-        &quot;Economic considerations must in the main determine   the  location of industry.   No decision can be come to   without balancing all the factors, including the value   of  the respective merits of old established and new   industrial districts.   Where there is equilibrium, the   decision should be in favour of the old, but it is futile,   to  attempt to establish industries in the Special Areas   when the economic facts do not warrant so doing.   It   would only afford temporary relief, bearing the seeds of   further future distress, which is avoidable.&quot;        The provisions of the previous paragraph (No. 14)are essentials to carry out such a scheme in South Wales.16.     The International Carbide Cartel handle practicallythe whole of the Carbide imported into this country, and norway is one of the largest exporters under quota from                       -12-
the Cartel,   The question of the manufacture of Carbidein this country has been discussed with representativesof the Cartel and they recognise that, if cheap power is available, the British Government, and the British OxygenCompany - the main importers and users of Carbide - would desire that Carbide should be manufactured in this country,in the same way as they manufacture Carbide for their ownuse in the respective countries embraced under theInternational Carbide Cartel,       It must not, however, be taken for granted thatthey will give up this market without a fight, and indeed it may be that they may try, if possible, to kill theindustry in its initial stages.       35 A copy is attached of the letter addressed by this company to Sir Percy Ashley, the Chairman of the TariffAdvisory Commission, dated the 16th November, 1935, dealingwith this position, should it arise.       Since that date, the surplus power of the BritishAluminium Co.  Ltd., referred to in the letter, which was offered to us to enable us to speed up the production ofCarbide at Corpach, is, unfortunately, not now&apos; available,17.     The British Oxygen Company Ltd, is prepared to:-       (i)  Establish these Industries in Inverness-shire,  -      (ii)  To spend approximately  3,000,000 in this            CountrjT&quot;, spread over three to four years.            This expenditure will almost wholly be spent            on wages in this country on;-               (a)  Construction of dams, watercourses,                   aqueducts, tunnels, culverts and other                   works of a like nature for the appropriation,                   impounding,  storing,  collecting;            s Not attached.                     -13-
