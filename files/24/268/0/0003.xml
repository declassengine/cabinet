Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries              and the Secretary of State for Scotland.   1.         We desire authority to proceed now with the  preparation of   a Bill for the reorganisation of the White Fish Industry.  The   second report  of the Sea-Fish Commission,  issued in  March,  1936,  sums   up the situation of the  White Fish Industry at  that  time in the   following  terms  -           ,?It  is  clear  that,  on the whole,  there is not in this   important  food product a remunerative return to the  producer,  or  a   satisfactory result  in quality and price  to the consumer;  and  that,   while -those engaged  in the distributive sections  are not  gaining  undue   profits, intermediate marketing expenses  are,  in total,  a heavy burden.            The report  indicates  further that  the problems  of  the   industry cannot &apos;be  satisfactorily  solved without  improved organisation   in all sections  and  that  improved  organisation  cannot be  achieved   without legislative  sanction.   2.        The recommendations  of the Commission for re-organisation   were briefly -          (i,) The appointment of  a Fish Industry Development Commission,      consisting of three persons independent  of  the Industry, for  a      period of five years, with  powers of registration,  licensing,      promotion and approvs.1 of  organisations, approval and initiation      of schemes,  and  of making  grants out  of  the funds obtained by      registration fees for general  administration  *f the sectional      organisations or towards  experiment, exploration, research,      marketing and publicity.         (ii)  The appointment by the Industry  of a Central Board of      representatives  of the various sections, with a neutral Chairman      as a co-ordinating body for the Industry as a whole,  to deal      with matters  of general policy and to be responsible, inter alia,      for market development and publicity.
5.   The Associations representing the distributive sectionsof the industry, namely, the wholesale merchants, fishmongersand fishfriers, have expressed themselves as generally infavour of these recommendations.   The British Trawlers1Federation, representing producers, have repeatedly urged tlia-regulation of production is the prime necessity of the whilefishing industry and that statutory provision for suchregulation, which they have endeavoured unsuccessfully to achieve by voluntary arrangement, ought to be made at once.They were strongly opposed to the proposed development commission and Central Board but this attitude has since been largely modified.4.   The main anxiety of producers is the progressiveexpansion in recent years of the catching capacity of thefleet,  due to competitive building of large trawlers forfishing in distant waters,  and a consequent increase oflandings of fish of low quality which unduly depress themarket.   As a result of this process the position of producers&apos; generally has deteriorated still further sincethe publication of the  Sea Pish Commission^ Report.   Theaverage value of British landings of white fish in 1935 - thelatest year reviewed by the Sea Pish Commission --was19s.iOd.  per cwt.,  or only 20 per cent,  above the 1915 valueof 16s. 5d.,  whereas the cost of production showed a veryconsiderable increase in every department.   In 1936 theaverage value fell to 17s.  8d.  per cwt..  and the cost ofproduction is still rising owing to increases in the priceof coal and other necessary supplies.5.   It is essential that this economic  decline should hearrested not only on accour.it of the importance of theindustrjr as a source of food supplies but also because themaintenance of a prosperous fishing industry is extremely important from the point of view of national defence.                          2.
6. The British Trawlers&apos;  Federation have laid before us  aproducers&apos;  marketing scheme which would confer on the Boardadministering it regulative powers such as may be conferred  on agricultural Marketing Boards under the Agricultural MarketingActs.   In particular provision is made for the Board to be  given power to license boats and to regulate landings of fish, with theobject not merely of preventing over-supply but also of  improving the quality of the fish supplied to the consumer.7. The Federation were desirous that their scheme should be  givenimmediate legislative effect separately from any measure of re-organisation which might be introduced for the distributivesections, but it was clear from consultations held with those sections that they would be opposed to such a course, and weconsider that it would not commend itself to public opinion.Accordingly we  informed the British Trawlers&apos; Federation that wewere not prepared to recommend to our colleagues that legislation should be introduced except on the basis of a comprehensive effortat reorganisation of the.whole industry, and that, while this neednot prevent  effect being given to their scheme without  delay, theinterests of  distributors  and consumers demanded that the workingof the  scheme should be  subject to the supervision  of some  impartialbody, analogous to the Development Commission recommended by theSea-Fish Commission.   We  further  intimated that the  establishmentof a  Central Board or Joint Council,  also  recommended by the Sea-Fish  Commission,  to  consider matters  of common  interest  to  theindustry as  a whole, was  desirable  and ought  to  be  provided  for  inany  legislation.    Such  a  body would  be primarily  consultative  but might have  executive functions  entrusted  to  it  by  the Commission orby the  industry.8.- The  British  Trawlers&apos; Federation have  now  intimated  their readiness  to accept  legislation  on these  lines,  which approximate                                3.
so closely to the recomiiiendations of the Sea-Fish Commission thatwe think the concurrence of the other sections of the industry may be presumed, although naturally questions may arise on points of detail.9.    The British Trawlers1 Federation are almost completelyrepresentative  of the trawling industry, which is responsible for95 per cent, of the total British catch of white fish, and may beregarded as a body qualified to promote a scheme on behalf of the major producing interests.  Their scheme has been carefullyprepared and subject to examination of details appears to us tobe such as might be approved.10.   The Scheme provides that the producers1 board shall contain independent members, who may be appointed by Ministers,to a number equivalent to one-third of the total membership.&apos;This provision, coupled with the supervision of the commission,should safeguard the public interest.  The interests of consumersare specifically protected by various provisions of the&apos;scheme,of which the two most important are those limiting the powers ofthe board to restrict production and to fix minimum prices.  Inthe case of distant water fish on which the fish friers mainlydepend the scheme prescribes a low upper limit which the minimum price is not to exceed.II.   In connection with proposals to regulate home production offish we find it necessary to refer to the question of regulationof imports.   If effect were given to the proposals ef theSea-Pish Commission in this respect the present quotas would bedrastically reduced.  The British Trawlers&apos; Federation, who are opposed to any  import of fish, have urged emphatically that effect should be given at least to the proposals of the Sea-FishCommission.  We think that, having regard to the productivecapacity of the British fishing industry, there is much to be said for a further reduction of imports.    We have not, however,encouraged the producers to hope for such a reduction, but we are aware that they have framed their scheme on the assumption that                             4.
imparts, will &quot;be restricted at least to the level of the past fewyears.  In our opinion, the aim in any trade negotiations should be at least to secure that the total imports of foreignfish do not exceed a quantity roughly equivalent to the present level.12..     Before any comprehensive scheme for the improvement ofthe distribution of white fish can be submitted and considered,the distributive sections of the industry will need to be more effectively organised.  At present the Association of WholesaleMerchants is fairly fully representative, but the existingAssociations of Fishmongers and Fish-Friers embrace only aboutSO per cent of their respective sections.13, .    the Sea-Fish Commission recommended a system of compulsoryregi3tration of the units engaged in the various sections of theIndus try s particularly with a view to developing the organisationof the distributive sections.  It is accordingly proposed toprovide in the Bill for che registration of distributors as oneOf the first, duties to be entrusted to the supervisory commissionreferred to in paragraph 7 above .14.     We propose that the Commission should also have power  (a) to assist in the organisation of the distributive sections      of the industry;  (b) to consider and recommend to Ministers schemes for improving      the distribution of fish;  (c) t9 supervise generally the working of the producers&apos;      scheme and of any other schemes!  (d) to make recommendations to Ministers for amendment thereof;  (e) to exercise in relation to such schemes the functions      performed by Consumers&quot; Committees and Committees of -      Investigation under.&quot; the Agricultural Marketing Acts;  (f) to consider the interests of small producers of white fish      who may not be within the main scheme;  (g) to make from the funds derived from registration fees      grants in aid of organisation;
     (h) to collect contributions from or to impose levies         on the different sections to form a fund to he         applied for purposes of benefit to the industry         generally. e.g.  experiment;? research, publicity and         markst development;     (i) to collect information;  and     (j) to advise Ministers  on matters of concern to the         industry.15.  It would be necessary to define in the Bill the powers which might be conferred on boards administering distributiveschemes.   These would include powers to license traders, toregulate trading practices, to promote standardization of thequality of fish and to deal with problems of redundancy ifthey should arise.   We shall wish to consult with the Presidentof the Board of Trade and the Minister of Health about theextent of these powers and about the safeguards necessary toensure adequate protection of consumers&apos; interests.16.  We propose that, as recommended by the Sea-Pish Commission,the supervisory commission should consist of three personsindependent of the industry and appointed by Ministers, theChairman on the basis of a full-time occupation, and that theirexpenses should be defrayed by the Exchequer.   Apart from this expenditure, our proposals would involve no call on public funds17.   We propose, with the concurrence of the President of theBoard of Trade, to provide in the Bill for the necessary amendments to  the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, to give effectto the recommendations of the Sea-Pish Commission relating tothe remuneration  of the crews of trawlers.18.   We propose  further to take this opportunity to introducecertain amendments, which experience has shown to be desirable,of existing sea fishery legislation.
     19.  It would be  convenient if the same opportunity could be taken to amend Section 6 of the Whaling Industry (Regulation) Act, 1934, to provide power to enforce the restriction of whaling by limiting the number of catchers attached to each factory ship.   This has, for the current season, been achieved by voluntary agreement with thewhaling companies, but it is desirable to have statutorypower to enforce it.     20.  We should be glad to have the authority of our colleagues for the preparation and submission to&apos; theHome Affairs Committee of a Bill embodying the proposalsfor legislation outlined above.                           (Intld.)    W.S.M.                                      W.E.JS,12th February, 1937.
