THIRD REPORT OF CABINET COMMITTEE.                         I .      The question ofthe Coronation Oath has been considered at several meetings of the  Coronation Oath Committee of theCabinet, and has been the subject of consultation with theDominion Governments.   The Cabinet will remember that thefirst section of the Oath as administered at the Coronationin 1911 read as follows:-            &quot;Will you solemnly promise and sWear to             govern the people of this United Kingdom             of Great Britain and Ireland, and the             Dominions thereto belonging, according to             the Statutes in Parliament agreed on, and             the respective Laws and Customs of the same?&quot;      This form is, of course, out of harmony with the present constitutional position.      The Cabinet will remember that the Dominions Secretary,in his conversations with Mr.  de Velera asked him his view asto a form of Oath based on the King&apos;s Title  which would referexpressly to &quot;Great Britain, Ireland, Canada, etc.&quot;   Thequestion of modifying the first part of the  Oath on theselines has been further considered, and as a result, theGovernments of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South ;Africa all agree to the following form of Oath, whilst theIrish Free State Government will acquiesce in it:-&quot;Will you solemnly promise and swear to govern the peoples of Great Britain, Ireland, Canada,  Australia, New Zealand and the Union of  South Africa,  of your possessions and the other territories to any of them belonging or pertaining,  and of your Empire of India, according to their respective  Laws and Customs?&quot;
     The Coronation. Oath Committee have considered this form, and recommend its acceptance.                       II.     It will he remembered that Mr. de Valera told theDominions Secretary that the chief difficulty about the coronation Oath from the point of view of the people ofthe Irish Free State was the third section of the Oath,which in 1911 read, as follows          &quot;Will you to the utmost of your power           maintain the Laws of God, the true           profession of the Gospel, and the           Frotestant Reformed Religion established           by law&quot;?   And will you maintain and           preserve inviolably the settlement of           the Church of England, and the doctrine,           worship, discipline, and government           thereof, as by law established in           England?   And will you preserve unto           the Bishops and Clergy of England, and           to the Churches there committed to their           charge, all such rights and privileges,           as by law do or shall appertain to them,           or any of them?&quot;     Mr. de Valera pointed out that this was arousingintense criticism amongst Irish Catholics, and said thathe. could not see any way of overcoming the difficulty.It appeared that the ground of the criticism in the FreeState was that the wording might be interpreted to mean that His Majesty would to the utmost of his power maintainthe Protestant Reformed Religion not only in England,where it is established by law, but also throughout theCommonwealth, contrary to the will of his subjects insome countries.   The Dominions Secretary mentioned thispoint in a conversation which he subsequently had with the archbishop of Canterbury.   The Archbishop suggested thatit might be possible to make an alteration in the wording of this part of the Oath which would clarify its intentionwithout altering its substance.   Some days later he
discussed this informally with the English Bishops,who were meeting at Lambeth Palace, and found themagreeable to such a change.   The following form hasnow been proposeds-            &quot;Will you to the utmost of your power             maintain the Laws of God, and the true             profession of the Gospel?   And will             you maintain and preserve inviolably             in England the Protestant Reformed             Religion and the settlement of the             Church of England and the doctrine,             worship, discipline and government             thereof as by law established?   And             will you preserve unto the Bishops             and Clergy of England, and to the             Churches there committed to their             charge, all such rights and privileges,             as by law do or shall appertain to             them, or any of them?&quot;       The Prime Ministers of Canada and Australiahave also expressed great anxiety about this partof the Oath, as in their view the form used in 1911does not make it clear that the King&apos;s promise isto maintain in England the Protestant Reformed       4Religion established by law.       In the light of this, the Coronation OathCommittee have examined the proposed alteration, and recommend that it should be accepted.
       A further question has &quot;been considered &quot;by theCommittee relating to the Accession Declaraion which, inaccordance with the Bill of Rights, has to &quot;be made by every King and Queen succeeding to the Throne &quot;on thefirst day of the meeting of the first Parliament nextafter his or her corning to the Crown sitting in his orher Throne in the House of peers in the presence of the lords and commons therein assembled or at his or herCoronation before such person or persons  who shalladminister the Coronation Oath to him or her at the timeof his or her taking the said Oath (which shall firsthappen)&quot;0  The form of the Declaration as amended by the accession Declaration Act, 1910, is as follows     /&quot;I (here insert the name of the Sovereign)       do solemnly and sincerely in the presence       of God, profess5 testify and declare that       I am a faithful Protestant, and that I will,       according to the true intent of the       enactments which secure the Protestant       succession to the Throne of my Realm,       uphold and maintain the said enactments       to the best of my powers according to law.&quot;/       As there has not been, and will not be, any new session of Parliament between the Accession of his present Majesty and the Coronation, it is necessary under the provision in the Bill of Rights quoted above,that the Declaration should be made at the Coronation.As will be seen,  it is expressly provided that it shouldbe made at the time of taKing the Coronation Oath.  Itdoes not apoear that the Declaration has in fact beentaken at the Coronation since the reign of George IIwhen it was made immediately before the Oath was
administered^ in subsequent Coronations, when theDeclaration had already been made in Parliament, therubric introducing the words of the Oath in the printedform of Coronation Service referred to the fact &apos;that theDeclaration had been so made.  But the Coronation OathCommittee were advised that it was not in lav/ necessarythat the Declaration should precede the Oathj theDeclaration could be made after taking the Oath so log as itwas made with due prominence &quot;at his Coronation ,;* ice,  during the coronation Service.  It war pointed out that it wouldscarcely be appropriates however,  that the King shouldbecrowned until he had made the Declaration! the actualcrowning takes place at a period in the serviceconsiderably later than the taking of the Oatho  Inview of the attitude of some of the Dominion.Governments as explained in Section II above it wouldseem desirable that the Declaration should not beplaced between the Recognition of the King by thewhole Empire and the Oath, the first part of whichequally concerns the whole Empire, but that it shouldbe taken immediately after the Oath, to the last partof which, dealing with the maintenance of the protestant Reformed Religion,  it is related.  Themembers of the Committee recommend this course.       As regards the wording  of the Declaration, the attorney-General has been consulted on the questionof leaving out the words &apos;bf my Realm&quot;.  He thinks thatthe commission of these words could be justified as aresult of t he change effected  by the Statute of westminster in relation to the position of the Dominions.
The words &quot;of my Realm&quot;  were appropriate when therewas in all senses one single realm.  They might reasonably be said to be inappropriate in presentcircumstances and may lead to objections being raisedby some Dominion Governments % therefore the committee recommend their omission.
