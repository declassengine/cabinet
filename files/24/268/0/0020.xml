CABINET                     INDIA           Hi        Appreciation of the Political Situation, bythe Government of India, dated 17th February, 1937.,        Circulated for the information of the Cabinetby the Secretary of State for India.,
      Confidential appreciation of the Political Situation       in India., dated the 17th February, 1937 issued on       the authority of the Secretary of State for India.1.     Operations in the Lower Khaisora Valley in NorthWaziristan have been brought to a conclusion, at any ratefor the time being.  The road from Khaisora to the BannuDistrict has been completed, -and most of the troops employedin the operations have been withdrawn from the area.  ATori Khel Wazir jirga &quot;fas seen on January 15th and acceptedGovernment orders.  There are, however, a few diehards whohave not yet made peace, and the Faqir of Ipi is stillbelieved to be in concealment somewhere in the Shalctuvalley.  He is reported to have been suffering frompneumonia.  Madda Khel Wasir and Mahsud jirgas were seen on January 28th and January 39th, respectively.  TheLiahsuds were informed that auction would be taken againstindividuals who played a prominent part in the recenttrouble, while the Madda Khels were fined as a tribe fortheir participation.  The general political situationthroughout Waziristan is now quiet.  Two outrages have however, recently taken place.  On February 6th, CaptainKeogh, of the South Tfaziristan Scouts, was shot at and seriously wounded while travelling in a car on the road between Razmak and South Waziristan.   He died the following morning.  A Scouts orderly who was Gravelling with him was killed.  On 7th February, Lieut.  Beatty of the NorthWaziri stan Scouts, while travelling in a car was -ambushednear Boya, by a party of about 8 men and killed.  Of 4Khassadars who were travelling with him, 2 were killed and2 were wounded.  The offenders carried off Rs.52,000 whichLieut. Beatty had in the car with him for payment tolocal Khassadars.  It is possible that the motive in the
case of this outrage was loot.  The motive for the murder of Captain Keogh is still unknown, and in neither case have the offenders yet been identified.2. &apos;    The elections to the new Provincial Legislatureshave already been completed in Bengal, Bihar,  Assam andOrissa and have made good progress in all other provincesexcept Madras and Bombay where polling commences in themiddle of February. &apos; notwithstanding the increased numberof electors, polling arrangements have proved adequate andno serious difficulty has so far been experienced in theconduct of the elections.       As was to be expected the excitement associatedwith the elections has led in some places to disturbancesof the people.ce, but on the whole there has been very littledisorder, and only a few cases have been reported from Biharin which polling was temporarily suspended on this account.In Bengal 23 persons were injured in an election fracas, -andin the Punjab there have been several instances in whichparties came to T3ows, resulting in the loss of two lives.In the United Provinces it became necessary in some districts to prohibit the carrying of weapons on election days.  Anobjectionable feature which has come to notice in Bihar andthe Central Provinces has been the- use of employees of localbodies, such as schoolteachers, to canvass for Congresscandidates where the latter had power to command their services.In the United Provinces a tendency was observed to make theelection campaign a pretext for preaching sedition on a widescale, and the Local Government were obliged to issue instructions for preventive action, which has been taken ina few instances.3.    &apos; The elections in Bihar and Orissa have resulted ina clear, although not very large, majority for Congress over
all other parties combined.   In Bengal, they have securedonly 54 out of 250 seats and, in Assam, 32 out of 108.They have prospects of an absolute majority in the united provinces, but, in the Punjab, they will form acomparatively small minority.  The election resultsundoubtedly illustrate the advantage &quot;which a single well-organised party possesses over a number of smaller groupscontesting elections independently.  Thus, in Madras,for instance, the Justice Party and the People&apos;s Partyhave failed to combine and the non-Congress vote will therefore be split.  At the same time among parties and groups other than Congress the real &quot;Work of partyformation is still to come.   Even in Bengal the non-Congressparties separately represented are eight in number, andit is therefore easy for Congress to a.appear as the largestindividual party.  In this,  as in other Provinces, itis too soon to attempt to gauge the ultimate strengthand composition of the parties in the local Legislature.In the meanwhile, the Congress party are&quot; preparing tohold their proposed &quot;National Convention&quot;  in Delhiat some time in March, at Y-rhich the elected Congressmenwill presumably receive their instructions from theall-India Congress Committee as regards work in the legislatures, and the question of office acceptance willbe decided.4.     An attempt was made by Congress to celebrate&quot;Independence Day&quot; on 26th January.  Instructions were issued by Jawahar Lai Nehru to all Congress committees tomake a prominent feature of the reading of the &quot;Independencepledge&quot; of January 1930,  This pledge is framed in veryseditious language and, since the suppression of the lastcivil disobedienco movement, no organised attempt has  been
 made to give it publicity.  The proposed action was, therefore, regarded as a definite challenge to the Government, and orders were issued by practically all Local Governments declaring the pledge to be forfeited and warning the public that those orders would bo enforced. As a result,  Jawahar Lai Nehru cancelled his instructions and scarcely any attempts -were made to carry out theoriginal programme..  The celebrations aroused little interestox&apos; enthusiasm.5.     The Bengal Nagpur Railway strike continued throughoutJanuary but has recently come to an end.-  Railway servicescontinued to be fairly well maintained and there was nodisorder during the strike.,
