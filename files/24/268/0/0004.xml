(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. )COPY NO.T ^SECRET.CP.54(37).                          CABINET.                     THE CORONATION  OATH._               Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for Scotland.          While I am anxious not to delay a decision on this question, I feel bound to invite the close attention of ray colleagues to one possible repercusBion of the alteration in the Coronation Oath recommended in the Third Report of the Cabinet Committee. ,^3.P.  bl^SI^.          The proposed oath specifically restricts the area of the obligation of the Sovereign,so far as this Oath is concerned, to maintain and preserve the Protestant Reformed Religion ;to England. I appreciate the reasons which have led the Committee to recommend that the Dominions should be excluded from the area of  this Obligation.   I also recognise that the position of Scotland has been dealt with in the Oath which the Sovereign subscribes immediately  upon accession.   Yet I am seriously apprehensive that  the omission of  any mention of Scotland  (and Northern Ireland) at a moment so&apos; solemn, may lead to strong criticism and feeling, based upon the belief that a real departure is  being made from the traditional adherence to the Protestant faith.          What ever -&apos;. ae views of the Dominions may be as regards them- selves  they cannot  justly  object to stipulations  couched in reasonable terms which concern this country alone.           I would therefore suggest for the consideration of my colleagues that, instead of placing the words &quot;in  England&quot; in                                                               the/
the forefront cf that part of the Oath whioh deals  withProtestantism, the revised draft en page 3 of CP,  51 (37)  should read as follows:-          &quot;.......Will you preserve and maintain inviolably in the     United  Kingdom the Protestant Reformed Religion?    And will     you preserve and maintain inviolably the settlement  of the     Churoh  of England........&quot;.                                     W.E.B,Scottish Office,   Whitehall,  S.W010     48th February, 1937.
