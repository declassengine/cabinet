We attach hereto the following documents which we have also had under examination :&apos;-1.    A Report (on the Commissioner^ Third Report)     of the Inter-Departmental Committee -     A-appendix I.2.    A Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer     covering a Note by the Treasury dealing     with Government action in aid of the     Special Areas in ways other than under the     Special Areas Act, viz. Government contracts     and Government establishments and giving     estimates of the financial commitments     involved in .the present Act and in the     extension discussed in Part I of Appendix I -     Appendix II.       Memorandum by the Chancellor of the     Exchequer containing certain alternative     proposals - Appendix III.
2.     Before dealing with the proposals in Part I of appendix I we desire %o draw particular attention to the considerations contained in Appendix II regarding government action in aid of the Special Areas in other ways than underthe Special Areas Act.3.     It will he observed from. Section I of Appendix II -Allocation of Government Contracts - that during the period 1stApril, 1935, to 30th. November, 1936, direct Contracts to atotal value of over  41,000,000 have been placed by the defence departments alone in the areas to which the preference underthe Government Policy applies.   Of this very large amount,no less than  24,000,000 represents orders placed in theSpecial Areas.   It must, of course, be remembered that these were orders placed in the initial stages of the defence programme, and that they will increase as that Programmeprogresses.4.     4 Section II of A.pp^appendix II - Location of government factories in the Special Areas - snows that the estimated expenditure on this service in South Wales alone amounts to 12,500,000, and that there is, in addition, a similar figure for the factories in other Special or Distressed Areas -Lancashire, Cumberland and South-West Scotland.5.      As regards Section III of Appendix II - financial commitments - it should be noticed that the financial commit-ments under the present Special Areas Act amount in all to 9,000,000, of which  7,500,000 is attributable to Englandand Wales and  1,500.,000 to Scotland.   Of this totalonly  2,300,000  has so far been actually expended, but theprocess is  cumulative both in regard to the amount expendedand the volume of employment provided.  The concluding paper of Appendix II draws attention inter alia to thevery  serious financial consequences which would result from an                         -2-
extension of the present Special Areas as at presentdefined,6.     This Report is concerned only with the recommendations in the Third Report of the Commissioner for the Special Areasin England and Wales, which may require legislation.   these recommendations are discussed in Part I, pages 5-19 inclusive of the Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee, Appendix Ito this Report,-Alterations in the Special Areas;__Alternative proposals.7.     After considering the various proposals set out inparagraphs 1-24 of Appendix I, we recommend that no alter-ations should he made in the existing schedule of SpecialAreas hut that the alternative proposals outlined in appendix iii should he substantially adopted.   Under these proposalspower will be taken to assist,&apos; by the provision of 25 per cent.of the capital, the formation of Public Utility companies operating outside the Special Areas for the purpose of acquir-ing sites and buildings and adapting the buildings where necessary.   While these Companies would hope to let theirbuildings at an economic rent, the possibility of some lossby the Government must be faced.   The detailed method ofproviding the Government share is being worked out.8.     In order to qualify for this assistance the area withinwhich the Company would operate would have to be certified by the Minister of Labour, on the recommendation of a Committee,as satisfying certain closely defined conditions as tointensity and duration of unemployment, dependence on a singleindustry and absence of prospects of recovery if not aidedin this way.9.     It is understood that this scheme, coupled with theprovision for financial assistance to individual firmsmentioned below, will go far to satisfy the claims of the&quot;                       -3-
depressed parts of Lancashire and that advantage will certainly he taken of it in that area, but it will, of course,be open to any other area outside the Special Areas to set upa Company of this kind provided that it can obtain theMinister of Labour&apos;s Certificate.10.     The 25 per cent, share of capital would be provideddirect by the Treasury, acting on the advice of an advisorycommittee (similar to those which functioned, under the                                              The  CommitteeDevelopment Act, 1929 and the Trade Facilities Acts), /would include Lord Portal and Sir Nigel Campbell, who are closely associated with the Ruffield Trust and S.A.E.A.,.and anadditional adviser to be selected later.   This would notimpair the present power of the Commissioner within theSpecial Areas to set up Trading Estate or similar companies with 100 per cent, capital from Government funds.   this power, is at present subject to the charging of an economicrent.Financial Inducements to new Industrial Undertakings.11.     (a) Special -areas and new Certified Areas.   as suggested in Appendix III, a fund of  2,000,000 would be allocated by the Treasury for the assistance of new indus-.trial undertakings establishing themselves either in theSpecial Areas or in the new certified areas.  Loans wouldbe made to such undertakings on favourable terms, whichwould vary with the circumstances of the case, includingthe need for new industries of the area concerned.   Thisfund would be administered by the same machinery as the pro-vision of capital to the Public Utility Companies mentionedab ove.
12.     (To) Special Areas only.   (i) In his third report the late Commissioner for the Special Areas(England and Wales) recommended that certain reliefsfrom rates and income tax should he accorded to new-firms establishing themselves in the Special Areas.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, speaking in the house on the 17th. November, accepted these suggestions inprinciple.15.      In order to avoid alteration of the generalincome tax and rating law and the necessity for working out exactly the position in regard to incometax, which may be impossible of exact ascertainment,we recommend that the firms concerned should continueto pay the full amount due to the Collecting Authoritiesbut that the Commissioner should have power to make grants to recoup undertakings who have accepted hisoffer in respect of the appropriate part of the incometax and rates paid by them.   The Commissioner shouldhave power to promise such grants for five years or any shorter period, at his discretion.-5-
 13*   (ii)  The  mt e raepartmental Committee recouiaended, Appendix 1-j paragraph. 3.2,  that  the  Commissioner should have power to  provide cheap  Bites ana buildings for a certain period.   In  Appendix III,  paragraph 18,  it is suggested  that this would  no longer be  necessary if the proposal for the  2,000,000 loan fund were  adopted. We reservedthis question for further discussion between the Treasury ana the  Couimissioner,   This discussion has how taken place. 14.     The Commissioner regards it as  essential  that he should  have discretion  to BIYS concessions in  regard to  rent over  a period not exceeding five years,particularly in those /laces which  are  most  in  need  of new industries.   The amount of the concession-would normally diminish progressively over the period.    Itwas pointed out that  the proposed Public Utility  Companiesmight well find-it necess nry, while  working generally on on economic basis,,  to moke concessions of  this  kind, ana that the Coiuuiissioner ought to  be in a position  tooffer at least as favourable terras.   As a result of the aiscussion It  was felt that power  should be taken in the Bill for the Commissioner to make concessions on the li tes  indicated above by contributing for a limited period towards the rent payable oy  new  firmso 15s     The net effect of these proposals as regards inducements to industrial undertakings  will  oe  that  in the Special Areas the Commissioners, the Nuffield Trustees (as such and as advisers for the new Government fund) and the Board of S&apos;.A.R.A.,  acting in consultation, will-o-
 13c   (11)  The  Interdepartmental Committee recormierided, Appendix I, paragraph  52,  that  the  Oprauiiesioner should. have, power to  provide  cheap  sites ana buxlaings fox? a ceitani period.    In Appendix III,  paragraph 18,  it is suggested  that this would  no longer- &quot;be  necessary if the proposal for the  2,000,000  loan fund were  adopted. We re served this eldest ion for further discussion between&quot; the Treasury ana the Commissioner.    This aiscussion has now taken place. 14.     The Commissioner rag arcs it  as  essential  that he should  hove discretion  to give concessions  in  regard to  rent over  a period not exceeding five years,particularly in those  daces which  are  most  in need  of new industries.   The amount of  the  concession would normally diminish progressively  over the  period.    Itwas pointed out that the proposed Tuelic Utility Companiesmight well find-it necess arys while working generally on an economic basissto make concessions  of  this  kind, and that the Commissioner ought  to be in  a position  to offer at least as favourable terms.   As  a result of the aiscussion it  was felt that power  should be taken  in the Bill for the Goinmlssloner to make concessions on the li tes  indicated acove by contributing for  a limited period towards the rent payable  cy new  firms. 15s     The net effect of these proposals as regards inducements to industrial undertaking &amp;  will  oe  that  in the Special Areas the Commissioners,  the  Nuffield Trustees (as such and. as advisers for the new  Government fund) ana the Board of S.A.H.A., acting in consultation, will
 be able to offer new firms any or all of the following a 11 r a c 11 o n s ; - -         Cheap  capitals         Cheap  sites,  and. buildings,         Grants xn relief of rates ana taxes* They will be  able to  grade these  inducements so as to give the maximum encouragement to go  to  the places where the need is greatest.         In certified  areas the attractions  will be cheap capital  for the Government  fund, and  sites or buildings mace available oy  the local Public Utility Company... As assistance to  Local,Authorities. 15.      Sir Malcolm Stewart&apos; s  Third Report  recommended that:-         &quot;The excess burden, of  public  assistance on          local authorities in  the Special Areas          should be  reduced by  some such means as        -  the equalising  of the public  assistance          rate  throughout the country&quot;.         We  recommend that, in  view of  the substantial alleviation in the  position of the hardest-hit Authorities provided by  the  revision  of  . the block  grant,  no lurcher assistance should be granted in connection  with  the new Special Areas Bill,  with the  possible exception that it might be desirable to make  an Exchequer grant towards the loan  charges payable  in respect  of certain exceptionally  costly  schemes of water supply and sewage, such  as affects Merthyr Tydfil,provided that  the scope of the grant could be narrowlyconfined.   This suggestion involves difficulties,  butit is being further explored,
17a     We recommend an amendment of the existingAct  to enable the Commissioner to make grants for the reconditioning of streets which, in the opinion of the&apos;Minister of Transport, come within this class.   TheMinister of Transport agrees to this proposal *Field Drainage o13.     Sir George Gillett has proposed that he shouldhe given power to assist schemes for field drainagesuch as  is exercised in Scotland by the Secretary ofStateo    We recommend that the existing Act shouldbe amended for this purpose.19*     If our recommendations as summarised above are accepted in principle by the Cabinet, we suggest thatwe siiould &quot;be authorised to arrange for the preparationof a draft Bill for the consideration of the Home                    for affairs Committee;and/the approval of the Cabinet, ifpossible on February 24th, 1937*                             Signed on behalf of the Committee.

                                  PART  I      RECOMMENDATIONS  WHICH  MAY REQUIRE LEGISLATION                     ALTERATIONS IN THE SPECIAL AREAS     1.  Two questions  of major importance on which  it is clear from the recent debate that attention will be concentrated  are those of alterations of the Special Areas and of inducements to industry to establish itself in those areas.   We  deal with  the second of these questions in detail in the next following section of our report, but it is necessary to bring it into consideration in general terms with the first question as the two are closely connected.   Extension of the  Special Areas must be looked at not only in the light of the intrinsic merits of the claim of some areas to  share in the treatment  accorded to others, but also  in  the light of the aggregate potentialities  of the practicable measures likely to be of real  assistance to such areas as are treated as &quot; Special &quot; and of the range within which they must be restricted if they are to produce appreciable results.    2.  The powers under the present Act  plus the inducements which might be offered to industry can be broadly summarised as            (a) Measures of social  improvement plus measures of indirect economic    . development ;           (6) Measures  of  direct  economic  development plus inducements to      industry.    By measures of indirect economic development we mean measures for generally cleaning up the areas, certain public works  (e.g.,  sewerage schemes), assistance to Development Councils, etc.   By measures of direct economic development we mean Trading Estates and site clearances mainly for industrial purposes.    3.  The extent to which the former can be applied is largely a question of money.   Many sphemes initiated  in the present Special Areas could be initiated in other areas.  These schemes have, however, already proved  very costly in the Special Areas and the cost would be increased, very roughly proportionately, as the areas were extended.  Moreover, while in many cases of real  benefit to the areas in which they  have been  applied, such schemes have been  criticised as being palliatives and as making little contribution to the permanent re-establishment of better conditions.    4.  The second class of powers is subject to different considerations.   They are the powers to which most importance is attached at the present time and in the light of whose success or failure the future of the Act is likely to be judged.  But the possibility of extension of these powers to other areas is not solely or even mainly to be decided in terms of money.   The vital consideration is that there is only a limited aggregate amount of effect which they are capable of  producing.   These powers aim at the establishment within the Special Areas of industries not already there.  But the total number of industrial  undertakings which are looking for a home or  which are ready to move from their present  homes  and which will be attracted to the Special Areas by any inducements which are within the sphere of practical politics is limited.   Broadly speaking, therefore, the wider the areas are drawn, the smaller will be the effect of these measures in any particular  place. More  than this, the wider the range of attractiveness or repellency within the areas for which these measures are available, the less will be the chance of the worst spots deriving any benefit at all from them.  Moreover, the wider the area, the greater the probability of opposition being raised to the policy of inducements from other parts of the country.  For inducements  are, after all, only the use of the taxpayers moneyto bribe industry to go not where it is economic, but where it is uneconomic.  Such a policy would probably command wide support if  directed to the few areas for whose plight  public sympathy is widespread. It might well excite  opposition if applied over relatively wide areas.
     5. The claimants to inclusion in the Special Areas are numerous and careful examination of their claims from many angles shows that there is no scientific orstatistical  criterion  for differentiating satisfactorily among  them.  The analysiswhich we give later in this Report shows that the minimum extension of areas, ifthe possibility of extension is admitted, is itself considerable.  And it is open to serious doubt whether in fact even that minimum  could be maintained.  Therewould remain many areas which would claim inclusion and which could show thaton all the measurable factors they were in as bad a plight as areas which had been included.   If, therefore, any extensions at all are approved it would probably proveinevitable that the extensions would have to be on a considerable scale.  Moreover,once an area was included in the Act, there is no doubt that there would be incessantpressure to have applied to it each and all of the measures authorised by the Act.     6. The results of any such extension would be twofold.  As regards the powersof social improvement  and  measures  of indirect  economic  development, a vastexpenditure would be involved,  or  alternatively, if  it proved possible to restrict the exercise of these particular powers, there would be the appearance that nothing was  being  done for the new areas despite their inclusion in  the Act.  As regardsthe measures  of direct economic development and the inducements to industry,the result would be such a wide dissipation of  effort that there would  be  little likelihood of any appreciable result being produced in any particular  place.     7. Each of these results would cause concern.  In particular, as  regards thelatter, if we are right in thinking that the success or failure of the new measures will  be judged by their industrial  effects, the result  of  wide  extension of  areas would appear to be to foredoom the measures to failure.   A noticeable increase ofindustrial activity in a limited number of  places,  especially  those of the greatest need, would be more likely to  be  regarded as a successful  outcome  of  the new measures than an increase of industrial activity, possibly greater in  the aggregatethan that envisaged for the limited number of places, but so widely  spread as notto be really noticeable anywhere.     8. The danger of dissipation of effort is well illustrated by reference to theNuffield Trust. If the  2,000,000 given by Lord Nuffield is restricted to the presentSpecial Areas and more especially if it is directed to  the places  of greatest need inthose areas, it should be able to make a marked difference to. their condition.  Butif it  is to be spread over an area two or three times  as great as the present areas,its effects will be  so thinly spread  as  to be negligible.   The danger is also wellillustrated by reference to the present Act.  The  Commissioners have entered with very large  commitments under their present powers and many important  scheme shave made good progress.  Yet there is constant  criticism that  nothing is being done.  The reason for this criticism rests upon a variety of causes, but one of thosecauses is undoubtedly the dissipation of effort over the present areas.  Had those areas been more narrowly drawn and been restricted to the  really black spots inSouth Wales, South-West Durham and Cumberland, the same expenditure of money and  effort would undoubtedly have  produced a much more impressive result.First Possibility     9. It  would  appear  from  these  considerations that there  are very strong reasons for not enlarging the areas. The first question requiring decision is, therefore,whether there should be any extension at all of  the  present  Special  Areas.Second Possibility     10. The next possible course would be to specify in the Schedule to the Billto amend the Special Areas Act  a small number of areas in  which conditions aresimilar to those which operate in appreciable parts of the Special Areas at presentschediiled and in respect  of which claims for inclusion have  been strongly urged.           (i)  Any new areas which are brought in  must not only  have suffered      severe  and  prolonged  unemployment over a considerable period in the      past, but  it  must  be clear  that the area  is still  severely affected by      unemployment and that there is no immediate likelihood of it making a      substantial recovery in the immediate future ; normally such areas would      be those dependent mainly on a single industry which is generally depressed      throughout the country ;
           (ii) Secondly the administrative difficulties in applying  the  Act to a      large number of scattered and industrially independent areas must, so  far      as possible, be avoided, and the area must be of such a homogeneous character      and of such substantial size as to make the application  of  the  Act to it      practicable and appropriate ;  there are many areas in which the application      of the  Commissioners&apos;  powers,  e.g.,  in respect of economic  development,      would by reason of the character of the area be of no effect.    11. An examination is made in Appendix  I  in the light of these  principlesof the suitability for inclusion in the amending  Bill of the many areas in respectof which a  claim  could reasonably  be  made.  The broad conclusion of the examination is that if it is decided to adopt this method the areas to  be specifically mentioned in the Bill should  comprise (1)  Wigan and District,   (2) the weavingdistrict of North East Lancashire, and  (3) the Forest of Dean.  All these are ares which are substantially dependent upon the coal or cotton industries.  The actuallocal  authorities to which  the provisions of the Act would  be  extended  are asfollows :                            Additions to Special  Areas      Wigan and District,  comprising :            Abram Urban District.

Standish Urban District.           Upholland Urban District.           Westhoughton Urban District.           Wigan County Borough.           Wigan Rural District.      North  East Lancashire, comprising :           *Accrington Municipal Borough.           Blackburn County Borough.           Blackburn Rural District (such part as lies between Darwen Municipal               Borough  and Oswaldtwistle Urban District).          *Church Urban District.          *Clayton-le-Moors Urban District.           Darwen Municipal Borough.           Great Harwood Urban District.          * Oswaldtwistle Urban District.           Rishton Urban District.      Forest of Dean, comprising :            East Dean Rural District (Cinderford).          *Lydney Rural District.           Newnham (Parish of).          *West Dean Rural District (Coleford).    Outline maps showing  these areas  are attached as Appendix II [a), (b) and (c)to this Report.    12. Claims for inclusion will also  be made on behalf of Cardiff,  Swansea,Newport, and Glasgow, which, owing to their diversity of interests, their size and resources, should be excluded on the ground that  treatment  as a Special Area isnot or should not be essential for them to recover a reasonable measure  of prosperity.Their present difficulties may to a large extent be properly regarded as secondaryto and arising from the depression in the hinterland of Special Areas  and they will accordingly automatically benefit  from an improvement of the  Special Areas.* Inclusion somewhat doubtful see Appendix I.
    13. Attention is also drawn to  a  further sub-division which might be madein the list of areas to which the Act should be extended if extension on these linesis decided upon.  It has been brought to notice that there are some depressed ares which do not wish to be called Special Areas in view of the stigma which that termimplies and which, it is said, tends to discourage industrialists from beginning newenterprises.   These areas urge that  it is not  necessary for all the powers  of theCommissioners, and especially those which are devoted to  social improvement, tobe exercised in their areas. A deputation from Lancashire Members of Parliamentrecently received by the Minister of Labour urged  that the amending Bill should avoid the term Special Area, but should be  based upon the principle that  it isdesirable to encourage the development of  industry in certain areas.  They  con-sidered that  funds should be  made  available to clear individual sites at present occupied by  obsolete industrial property  and already equipped with water,  gas,and other services which would  have  to be provided at considerable expense on new estates.    14. It seems impracticable to adopt the whole of the idea behind this proposalbut in the event of the adoption of  the method of proceeding only by schedulingcertain districts in the amending Bill,  it would be  for consideration whether onlycertain powers should be applied in the new areas or whether no distinction shouldbe in the Act between the various Special Areas.    15. We have already referred to the pressure there  would undoubtedly beto have all the powers available applied in each area.  If it were possible to include a restriction of powers in the Act, such pressure would-be futile  once the Act waspassed.   It would clearly be difficult to carry such restriction.  But  if there is no restriction in the Act itself, there is little practical possibility, however moderatemay be the demands of areas at the moment, of securing any appreciable restrictionby administration. It is true that little or  no direct assistance  has been given toNewcastle and in a later paragraph about inducements to industry, we recommendthat greater inducements should be  given to. an undertaking to  establish itself insay, Bishop Auckland than on Tyneside. But the practical possibilities of restriction of assistance by the exercise of discretion are not  great and pressure to have all available powers applied would be incessant.    16. The advantage of proceeding  by way of specifying in the Bill the  actualareas to which the provisions  of the Act should be  extended would be that  such acourse would be definitive.  Though it could hardly be regarded  as disposing ofall the claims which have been or will be made from time  to time the sanction ofParliament would be given to the areas named in the Bill and to no others.     17. A Reservation by the Scottish Office with regard to this  second possibilityis attached (Appendix III).  It indicates that the  Scottish Office do not considerthat this possibility would be satisfactory, at any rate in relation to Scotland.  If,however,  that method should be adopted  as a question  of policy, the scottish office suggest that the extensions mentioned  in the Reservation will be necessaryin Scotland.Third Possibility    18. The insertion in the Schedule to the amending Bill of a list of areas of sorestricted a nature as that indicated in paragraph 11 above, would be regarded by many as  inadequate.   Accordingly, in case this method is considered to beuntenable, a  third and fourth method of bringing  new areas within the scope ofthe Act have been examined.  The third suggested  method is, in brief,  to providefor the inclusion of certain specified areas in the Schedule to the Bill as outlined above and to provide the Minister of Labour or the  Secretary of State for Scotlandwith powers to make additions to the areas.   In deciding which areas should beadded the appropriate Minister would, it is suggested, proceed by way of an Enquiryconducted, it may be,  by an informal or ad hoc Committee which would advisehim, but he would be in no way bound to accept the Committee&apos;s recommendation.Areas would be  added by Order as suggested in the fourth method.
    19. This power at odd areas should, it is suggested, be coupled with the powerto prescribe both in respect of these areas and in respect of such of the areas as may-be already in the Schedule some  limitation of the powers of the Commissioners.But we have already referred to the real  difficulties of restriction and while thosedifficulties might be somewhat less  if the support of a Committee had been obtained,it is doubtful whether there would be any appreciable easing of the difficulty underthis method.Fourth Possibility    20. The fourth  course which  might be adopted  would be not to specify anyareas for inclusion in the Schedule to the Bill but to provide for the appointmentof a Statutory Committee which,  guided by some general formula, would advise the appropriate Minister which areas should have the benefit of the Commissioners&apos;powers  and  which  of  the  Commissioners&apos;  powers  should operate in particular areas.   The general  formula would consist  of a  direction  in the Bill that, before making a  recommendation to the  Minister that the provisions of the  Act,  asamended, should apply to  a  particular area, the Statutory Committee must  besatisfied             (i) that unemployment in the area has been severe for a substantial      period of time,  and is likely to continue to be severe ;           (ii)  that  the  area is  substantially   dependent for the  provision  of      employment on  a  single industry, in which a high rate of unemployment      is general throughout the country ;          (iii) that the application of the Act, as  amended, to the area is necessary      if the area is to recover a reasonable  measure of industrial prosperity ;          (iv) that the area either itself  or together  with other areas in  respect      of which an application for inclusion has  been made, is of a size sufficient      to justify the  application of the Act.    On receipt of the Statutory Committee&apos;s advice the appropriate Minister wouldmake an Order to include that area or areas  within the scope of the Act.General    21. It will be  observed  that  the courses  outlined  above  which envisage-extension would open  up in differing degrees but all to a wide extent the field forthe exercise  of the  Commissioners&apos;  powers and  lead to a considerable dispersal of effort.   In particular, as regards the third and fourth courses, an examinationof numerous formulae based on the persistence  of a high rate of unemploymentover a prolonged  period  and the  substantial dependence  of an area on a singleindustry (and an industry closely allied thereto) suggests that unless the discretionunderlying the  four conditions is firmly  exercised they would go  so far as  to throw the  door open to the inclusion of a very large number of areas industriallyindependent of each other and scattered at random throughout the country.Omissions from the Scheduled Areas    22. The above  paragraphs examine the question  of  bringing areas withinthe Act. If, as is suggested, under  the first possibility there are to be no extensions,it would probably be impracticable to consider exclusions.  But if there are to  beextensions, the question of exclusions would  also have to be considered.  As  regardsthe removal from the Act of areas  at  present scheduled  or subsequently added,a less restrictive test would have  to be applied for purposes of exclusion than for those of inclusion.   In general, it  would suffice  to include a provision  in the bill that an area should  be removed from the Act if it has achieved such a measure ofindustrial recovery as to render the application  of the Act to the area no longer necessary.     23. If the course is adopted of naming in the Schedule to the amending bill the areas to be included within the Act, it might be desirable to exclude from theSchedule  to the Bill  certain  areas in  which it would appear  that  conditions have already been reached which would justify their exclusion.    The position of places which  might be  omitted is examined in Appendix I.
    24. If, however, a course is adopted, under which there would be an enquiryfor the purpose  of determining areas to which the provisions of the Act shouldbe extended, it is considered that the question of excluding any particular area,which had apparently reached such a stage of industrial recovery as to render theapplication of the Act no longer necessary, should be referred to subject to asimilar enquiry.  The actual exclusion should be by Order as suggested for casesof inclusion.         FINANCIAL INDUCEMENTS TO  NEW INDUSTRIAL UNDERTAKINGS    25. Section 1 (5)  (a) of the Act  of  1934  precludes the Commissioner from giving financial assistance to any undertaking carried on for the purpose of gainexcept in the limited cases covered by the first proviso which permits  assistancebeing given to such an undertaking if  the primary object is providing the meansof livelihood for  the persons engaged in the  undertaking with a view to theirestablishment in a position of independence or  partial independence of  assistance under Unemployment Assistance Act, 1934, or under the Poor Law.    26. Hitherto this  limitation of the  powers of the Commissioner  has beenaccepted as axiomatic but in his Third Report the Commissioner for Special Areas(England and Wales) came to the conclusion that in order to meet the paramountneed for establishing new industries in the Special Areas this  principle  should beset aside.   He recommended that new industries and the extension of old industries in the Special Areas should be offered financial inducements for a period of seven years as follows :            (i) Relief  from  Income  Tax   on  profits earned by limited liability    .  companies  other than such profits as  distributed by  way of dividends ;      partnership firms to receive relative appropriate treatment.           (ii) Exemption from  Income Tax on  all profit  not exceeding  500 a      year that would normally be calculated as liable for assessment.           (iii)  Relief from all local rates ; the local authorities to be correspondingly      reimbursed by the Exchequer, and           (iv) The grant of long term loans at a low rate of interest to procure the      introduction to the Special Areas of technical processes new to this  country.    27. On the 17th November the  Chancellor  of the Exchequer accepted the suggestions  of the Commissioner, in  principle, and this acceptance was  given in a qualified form only because  a little  more time was required to see whether the exact form  in which the proposal was put was the best calculated  to  effect thepurpose which the Commissioner had in view.    28. The fourth of these recommendations may be disposed of first.   It is hardly susceptible of treatment in a general statute or through the Commissioner.It is understood  that  certain major matters lay at the back of Mr.  Stewartsproposal (e.g. the production of Calcium  Carbide)  and as and when these arise,it would appear to be appropriate that the Government should  take ad hoc actionto give effect to any decisions reached.    29. The first three proposals involve difficulties in  the form in which theyare put in the report as in that form they involve alterations of the general incometax and rating law of the  country.  There would be considerable objection to themaking  of  such  alterations  limited to particular parts  of the  country.   Thesubstance of the proposals  could however be  secured in  other  ways  which we discuss later which avoid these difficulties.    30. It may be doubted whether in fact these three inducements (more especially the first  two) would be found in practice to attract industry in any appreciabledegree.   As regards income tax, the lowering or waiving of a tax on profits cairnotin itself do  anything to enable a concern  to make profits.   It cannot turn a lossinto a profit.  Moreover, the amount which would be involved to a concern whichanticipated  the making of profit would be small compared  with the  other factors
which might weigh  with them  in  selecting their  location proximity  to rawmaterials, accessibility to markets, availability of labour supply.  The particularsuggestion of relief on  500 is worth  120 a year if in fact profit is made, a sumequal to the wages of one worker for a year.     31.  As regards rates, the relief is of somewhat more substance, but even here,complete relief of the 25 per cent, of rates which alone remains is probably not worth more than on average about J per  cent, on  selling  price to a  concernbenefiting from derating.  Complete relief from rates for a period has, however,psychological attractions as  it removes  for  that period  fear of increased rates.     32.  We assume that in the new Bill the Chancellors pledge will be implemented,.but having regard to the exiguous character of the relief proposed by Mr.  Stewartwe suggest  that there should be linked with these inducements a proposal for theprovision of free or cheap sites and buildings  which  has been made by the presentCommissioners.   This proposal serves  a  double object.  It affords a means notmerely of attracting  industry to the Special  Areas  generally,  but of attracting itto the spots where it is most desired to  see new industrial undertakings  started.And it  helps to clear up  some  of the derelict  sites which are now substantialcontributors to the general repellent character of those spots.  On the assumptionthat inducements under the  heads of  income tax,  rates and  sites and buildingswill be granted,  we proceed to examine  a number  of important questions which arise.Scope    33. Mr.  Stewart referred to  &quot; new  industries and the  extension  of oldindustries.&quot;  In order to avoid difficult questions of demarcation we think that&quot; industries &quot;  should be referred to as industrial  undertakings and  should be defined by reference to a criterion for which there is a statutory basis.   We  suggestthat the definition should be based on the &quot; industrial hereditament &quot; as under-stood under .the Rating and  Valuation Acts.   &quot; New &quot; and &quot; extended &quot; causeus more difficulty.  If substantial inducements are available, there will be an obvioustemptation to existing  industrial undertakings to try  by all means available tobecome qualified for those inducements. The real protection against such effortsmust, we think, be the exercise of discretion by the Commissioner. This is,  in fact,the first of a number of points all of which emphasise the need for leaving the grantof inducements entirely to the discretion of the Commissioner.  There must be no legal right to claim that an inducement must be given.    34. We feel on this point especial difficulty  as  regards  &quot; extensions &quot; ofindustrial undertakings.  The  possibilities of artificial  arrangements designed to qualify an industrial undertaking for the new  terms but not in reality increasingemployment in the Special Areas are very much greater here than the case of &quot; new &quot;industrial undertakings.  In view of this danger and in view of the real object ofthe scheme which is to attract new firms to the areas, we suggest that there is astrong case for confining the concessions to  &quot; new &quot; industrial undertakings.    35.  We think that there must clearly be a minimum limit  of size to  qualify for an inducement, and we suggest that it  should be fixed by reference to theadditional number of employees likely to be engaged.  We think  that 10 would bea suitable limit.Variation of Inducements    36. We think  that it is essential that the Commissioner should have power to vary the scale of  inducement  within the statutory maximum in relation to thecircumstances of each case.  In particular  it seems to us to be vital to have suchpower  to vary in relation to the location actually selected by the industrial under-taking.  Unless  there is  such  variation,  new undertakings  will obviously  be concentrated on the Trading Estates, which offer other special attractions or in theimproving parts of the areas.
Duration of Inducements    37. Future  developments  cannot be foreseen,  and  it  would clearly  beunjustifiable  to offer favourable terms over a long period of years.  New under-takings, if they are ever to be economic, should be able to  dispense with specialaids and to pay an economic rent after a time.  Otherwise, their establishment inthe areas  cannot  really be  justified.  The period  for  his  proposed concessionsvisualised by Mr. Stewart was seven years.    38. The  considerations in the preceding paragraphs suggest that new under-takings might be offered for a period not exceeding seven years concessions on incometax and rates and  a site  and building at  a rent which would vary from a nominalfigure in the black spots to a full economic rent according to the  degree in whichit was considered desirable to attract industry to the particular place in question.Determination of the degree  of assistance would be decided by the Commissioner.Special consideration might have to be given and different terms to be allowed in special cases  e.g., an undertaking requiring a highly specialised factory whose value to any other teriant would be  relatively small.    39. The concessions should be available for acceptance  during the period forwhich the office of  Commissioner is continued in existence.  The seven years would run from the date  of acceptance.Method of dealing with Income Tax and Rates    40. In order to avoid alteration of the general income tax and rating law, wesuggest that the industries  should pay tax  and rates in the ordinary way, but thatthe Commissioner  should have power to make grants during the period  suggested to recoup undertakings who  have accepted his offer in respect of the appropriatepart of the income tax and rates paid by them.  We would emphasise that these payments must be fixed at  the discretion of the Commissioner.   Income  tax inrelation to the subject of the inducement may be impossible of exact ascertainmentin the case of an undertaking which is merely a branch of a larger undertaking, and little  more than a guess  will be possible.   Rates may present some, though less,difficulty of ascertainment, but here it is vital to guard against the risk of inflatedassessments which would be run if the occupier were relieved of  all rates.  TheCommissioner^ assistance under this head must be in such a form as to leave  theinterest of keeping the assessment down with the occupier.Position of existing Industrial Undertakings    41. We have  already  referred  to the  case of the existing undertaking whichattempts to turn itself into a &quot;  new &quot; undertaking &quot; for the purpose of  the Act &quot;by artificial arrangements.   It will be for the Commissioner to defeat these effortsas best he can.,    42. Two other cases of  existing undertakings may  cause more difficulty anddeserve special mention.           (i) The first is that of the undertaking which will claim that it is on the       point  of closing down and will have to close unless inducements  are given       co it to remain open.  A genuine case of this kind in which administration       was good would  clearly  be deserving of special treatment.   It must be       realised, however, that the truth of the assertion would be extraordinarily       difficult to  check, and that there, would be very wide possibilities of abuse.       We think that it  is impossible without running the gravest risks of Wide-       spread subsidies to admit this type of case for consideration.           It should be appreciated that the fact that  assistance by  way of       inducements was  not available in  these cases would not  mean  that they       were necessarily without help.  It might well be that in cases of this type       appropriate assistance could be given under  S.A.R.A.  or possibly by  the       Nuffield Trust.           (ii) The second case is  that of an existing undertaking  which claims       that it is adversely  affected by the competition of a new subsidised under-       taking.  Mr. Stewart  proposed that there should be a tribunal to consider
        such cases who could award such measure of subsidy as they thought proper        to the existing firm.  We regard this point as one of real difficulty. Obviously,        if there is an existing undertaking in an area which a new one enters as a        competitor the right course is to subsidise neither,  not to subsidise  both.        At  the  time competition showed itself, however,  it would  be too late to        withhold subsidy from the newcomer.  After careful consideration, we  think        the right course is to reject Mr. Stewarfs proposal on  this point.  But if        it is so rejected, it becomes more than ever incumbent on the Commissioner        to take all possible  care in admitting an undertaking to inducements that        it will not compete with an existing undertaking in the area.  We think that        close co-operation with Industrial Development Councils  and Managers of        Local  Employment Exchanges would in practice  reduce  the danger of        competition to negligible  dimensions.  Sites and Buildings      43.  Lastly, we set out the general arrangements which  we suggest should  apply to the provision of sites and buildings.      The  first point is who should be responsible for the erection of factories,  collection  of rents, etc., once the central machinery had made a bargain with the  undertaking which was  to settle  in  the areas.  Local Authorities appear  to be  unsuitable.  They have no direct industrial contracts, their legal powers in the matter  are open to question, and there would  be  difficulty  in maintaining a grading of  assistance if the scheme were under  local  authorities.  The Commissioners  could  themselves run the scheme,  but  it  appears  undesirable to attach to  them the  administrative and technical staff which would be necessary over a period of  years.      44.  In practice, choice lies between the Trading Estates Companies and new  ad hoc Companies.  The only argument against using the former (each for the  Special Area in which it is  situated) is the possibility of a clash of interest between  their concern  for their main estate and  their interest in  other parts of the  areas.  If assistance is graded as suggested and if the decision on this point lies with someone  other than the Trading Estate directorate, it would not appear that there would in  practice be any real clash of Interest.  .It would of course be necessary to secure the  goodwill and co-operation of the Trading Estates Companies in any such extensions  of their original functions but no difficulty is  anticipated in this.  It would be  understood that the initiative in  attracting undertakings to sites,  other than the  Trading Estate proper, would rest on the Commissioners, and that the Companies  would act primarily as  the agents of  the  Commissioners  in acquiring land and  building factories  on such sites.      45. In a Special Area  in which there is no Trading Estate it would, of course,  be necessary to set up an ad hoc new Company.  The financial arrangements should  conform  as nearly as possible to those applying to  the present Trading Estate,  i.e., they  should be required to  aim at earning a fixed percentage, say 4 per cent.,  on their capital outlay, subject to a suitable latitude as regards the period during  which expenditure is unproductive. The concessions  on rent could be regarded as  rebates or remissions of rent and  the Company authorised to deem themselves to&apos;  have  received an  amount certified by the  Commissioner to have  been allowable  in rebates.  An allowance  will have to be made in some cases for cost of clearance  of sites.   In theory, the cost of clearing a derelict  site would seem to be reflected  in the cost price of the site, but it is  understood that in practice  this is not always  fully the case.       46. Only a limited number of sites should be acquired and cleared in advance  of prospective tenants.  Factories should not be erected in advance as a speculation,  save to a limited  extent on definite Trading Estates like the Team Valley Estate  at Gateshead and the Treforest Estate,  South Wales.  The site clearance schemes  themselves, however, may not always be analogous to a proposal such as that to  clear Palmers Yard at Jarrow, which can be justified on the ground that clearance  is solely  for  economic development.  There are other  schemes which  although  primarily for economic development, contain elements which are justified, largely  as social  improvements, e.g., the removal of an eyesore and  its conversion to  a  public open  space because it is not fully suitable for economic development, but
even this side of a scheme has an indirect economic advantage, since the presenceof such eyesores is undoubtedly a deterrent to industrialists seeking new enterprisesin the Special Areas.  For such clearances, special terms would have to be arranged.                       OTHER ASSISTANCE TO  INDUSTRYS.A.R.A. and the Nuffield Trust    47. In this section we have so far considered the  specific suggestions  madeby Mr. P. M. Stewart and the present Commissioners for the grant of inducementsto undertakings to go  to  the  Special Areas.  It  should be appreciated that inaddition to these new suggestions, there are other means  by which assistance canbe given to undertakings in the areas, whether or not they are the subject of induce-ments from the Commissioners.  The recently created Nuffield Trust intend, it isunderstood, to devote the major part of  the  Trust  Fund of  2,000,000 to theeconomic rehabilitation of the  Special Areas.   In addition to this, the SpecialAreas Reconstruction Association are in a position to  make loans to undertakings in cases which  cannot obtain money  through ordinary channels.  The powers under S.A.R.A.  are frequently misunderstood.   For example,  although a limit of 10,000 in any one case is referred to in the Agreement, this limit can be  exceededwith Treasury  Sanction and  that sanction would be  readily given in any propercase.  Also, although the capital of the Association is  1,000,000, it does not follow that this is the total amount  of the loans they can make.  The  1,000,000 forms arevolving fund and as loans are repaid, the money becomes available for the making of further loans.Subsidy to Wages during a Period of Training    48. The Ministry of Labour can undertake to train semi-skilled factory workerswithin the few weeks which must inevitably elapse between the  decision to  opena new industry and the time when the workers would normally be  required.    49. Sir George Gillett is doubtful, however, whether this offer  would act asa powerful inducement to firms to go to the Special Areas.   It does not  differgreatly from the offer made to firms  anywhere in the country and it would bedifficult, if not impossible, for the Ministry to provide training courses in certainoccupations,  especially those  connected with the heavy industries for which large capital plant would be required.  Industrialists complain  that  one of  the dis-advantages of the Special Areas is the lack of trained craftsmen,  and  many ofthem think, rightly or wrongly, that the best place to train workers for their own requirements is in their own factories.   They want to get production started, bueknow that  efficiency of output must  be impaired while workers  are learning thtskill required.  He would, therefore, prefer to be able to offer to bear,  say, halfthe wages for the first six months of all workers not previously employed on similarprocesses, recruited in the area and being trained by the firm for skilled or genuinelysemi-skilled jobs.    50. If  the new firm has  to take on  workers,  who have  previously  beenemployed on similar processes, but have been out  of  work for, say, six months or over and have lost their skill or quickness, a subsidy for six months would not of course be necessary.  In such case he would like to be able  to offer to  bear halfthe wages for six weeks the subsidy to be payable at  the  end of twelve weeks andto be conditional on the firm&apos;s having paid the men full wages during  the secondperiod of six weeks.  These offers would only be open for the initial period  following the establishment of a business new to the Area, and it might be possible to attach a condition that they applied only to married men over, say, 40 years of age orto any other class of  worker for whom it was particularly  desirable to  secureemployment.    51. It  will  be  noted,  however,  that these proposals involve  a  number ofdefinitions of the type of person in respect of whom the subsidy would be payable.These would be difficult to determine with any certainty, e.g., what is  a similarprocess, at what stage is previous skill or quickness lost, and the actual  assessment of the subsidy  after the persons to whom it applied had  been settled,  would stillbe somewhat tiresome as it would involve a scrutiny of wages sheets to determine the actual wages paid.  In all the circumstances it would seem preferable if it isa subsidy to wages that  is required  to adopt  something more  straightforward,
e.g., a grant at some round figure such as  10 a head for each man employed forthree months during an initial period of six months provided that he were  stillemployed for six months in all.    52. As a condition of any such subsidy the employer would have to undertaketo engage his workers through the Employment Exchange and generally speaking to accept the individuals  submitted.  Otherwise, there would  be no means of ensuring a preference for those most in need of employment.  A subsidy on thelines contemplated would  give no guarantee of permanent  employment.   Apartfrom this, however, the general objections to any subsidy to wages are so serious that it will probably be considered better to give a more generous subsidy in other directions and to avoid any specific relationship to actual wages or precise numbers employed in its assessment.          ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN THE SPECIAL AREAS    53. The third major question which has to  be considered is the problem oflocal rates in the Special Areas.  This has been  the subject of many suggestionson  varied lines.   The particular recommendation in the  Third Report of theCommissioner  for Special Areas on the subject is as follows:           &quot; The excess burden  of public assistance on  local authorities in the       Special  Ar as should be reduced by some  such means  as the equalising of       the public assistance rate throughout the  country.&quot;    54. The questions involved in this and analagous recommendations have beenconsidered  in  detail  by a sub-committee  whose report is  attached hereto as appendix IV.   It  is hardly  possible to summarise briefly  the  arguments  and conclusions of the sub-committee, which can only be appreciated from a study ofthe Appendix  itself, but attention may be drawn to the  following points :            (a) A  high level  of rates is  a  normal sympton of acute industrial       depression and is relevant to the industrial problem  to the extent (which       can  easily  be&apos;&apos; overstated) to  which it  acts as a deterrent  to industry.       Where, as in certain of the Special  Areas, the high rates are thought to       be an expression, not only of the impoverishment of the area but also of lax       standards of local administration, the deterrent operates with greater force.           (b) There are not only wide variations in the  level of rates within the       Special Areas but certain relatively prosperous districts outside the Special       Areas (e.g., Hull) show  a rate level which  is considerably higher than that       of certain of  the Special Areas themselves.  Examination of the figures       suggests that the only areas in which the high level of rates is an important       contributory factor  to the prevalent  depression are the County Borough of       Merthyr Tydfil, certain areas in the counties of Glamorgan and Monmouth,       and (to a less extent) certain areas in the County of  Durham.           (c) The sub-committee&apos;s report indicates that the Special Commissioners       proposal to relieve the rate burden on the Special Areas by equalising the       charges in respect of public assistance is open to the gravest objections in       principle, and  would present almost  insuperable administrative difficulties.       Moreover, it would stand little or no chance of acceptance by the other       local authorities of the country.           The alternative, which has been suggested by some local authorities,       of reducing  the rate charge in respect of  public assistance to the average       level of the country by means of an Exchequer grant would involve no less       serious objections.           (d) The sub-committee refer to  the substantial measure of Exchequer       assistance already  enjoyed by the local authorities in the Special Areas,       and in  particular to the relief afforded by  the financial arrangements of the       Unemployment Act, 1934 (which took effect  as  from  1st March,  1935),       and to the further relief which will be available as from the 1st April next       as a  result of the revision of the Block Grant.
    The figures given by the sub-committee show that prior to the operationof these particular measures, the percentage of total expenditure falling on public funds which was borne by the Exchequer already ranged from 57-4to 69-5 in the counties containing Special Areas,  and from 39-9 to 54-8in the County Boroughs which are Special Areas.    The additional relief attributable to the two measures above-mentionedis shown in the following table : 	Estimated prospective additional relief to rates under block grant, etc., revision.

(e) If it should be decided in the light of these and the other considera-tions set out in the Sub-Committee&apos;s report, that  some further  exchequer subsidy in aid of the most  highly-rated districts in the Special Areas is unavoidable, it is considered that, on the whole, the method of assistancediscussed  in  paragraph-15 of that report is open to least  objection, andwould  have  the  merit of concentrating  assistance  in the districts mosthardly hit.  This method would consist in  providing an Exchequer grant towards the loan charges payable in respect of certain exceptionally costlyschemes of water supply and sewerage in Merthyr  Tydfil and certain urban districts in Glamorganshire and Monmouthshire.    It must be recognised  that this method of  assistance would not be applicable to authorities in County Durham,  where for the most part Capitalcommitments by Local Authorities on water and  sewerage  have not beenexceptionally heavy, and where, in  so far as such expenditure  may need to be incurred, assistance can be a&apos; .d presumably would be given by theCommissioner under existing powers. Moreover, as  indicated, the existingrate position of authorities in County Durham is less serious than in SouthWales.  There is  only one urban authority  in Durham with  rates over20s. in the  .    As regards  Scotland, there  are a number  of districts  in the SpecialAreas with rates slightly in  excess of an equivalent figure which may havea claim to similar treatment.
           (/) Special attention is drawn to the suggestion of the Sub-Committee       (which is, however, the  subject of a  reservation by the Treasury) that       some form  of special assistance  should be given from the Exchequer to       stimulate the development  of the educational services which relate to the       health and  physical well-being  of school  children and the maternity and       child welfare services in the Special Areas.  This is not, of course, advocated       on the ground of rate-relief but, in view of the importance attaching to       nutrition  and physical welfare, it is  considered essential that these services       should not be allowed to suffer because  of the financial circumstances of the       responsible  Local Authorities.   It will  be  appreciated that the subvention       by the Commissioners of a revenue service  (as distinguished from capital       expenditure) would mean a specific extension of their powers,  but, while       recognising  the objections of principle to which  the  Treasury reservation       alludes, the Committee are  of opinion that the proposal merits the serious       consideration of the Ministers.                               ROAD  SCHEMESPowers of the Commissioners    55. The limitation  which prevents the  Commissioners  making  a grant toany Local Authority except as a contribution towards the  cost of any works forwhich no specific grant is payable by any Government Department (provision ofsmall holdings or allotments excepted) prevents grants  for services which are notworks, and  there have  been complaints that  grants can and have been  made to voluntary  organisations  for  miscellaneous health  services  which  ought  moreproperly to have been carried out by a Local Authority which had failed to providethe service only because funds were not available.   This situation should be ade-adequately met by the added assistance to be given under the revised block grantformula, the additional grants  which may perhaps  be made in some cases, seeparagraph 54 (e), and by the proposal to give the Commissioners power  to assistcertain of these  services, see paragraph 54 (/).    56. There remains the limitation of the type of works to  which assistancecan be given.  Payable has been interpreted by the Law Officers to mean, mightbe paid under express Statutory Powers, and not merely is being paid.    In practice this limitation has been found to be inconvenient only in the case of Roads.    57. The Minister of Transport has  given particular consideration to the need of the Special Areas, and the Commissioner has exercised his duty to make recom-mendations  under Section 1  (3) of the Act in three cases.   His support of the severn Bridge was accepted as an  additional reason which induced the Minister tooffer a grant of 75 per cent, of the cost of executing that project, which failed onlyin Parliament.  In the  case of the Tyne crossings, the Minister largely shared the views of the  Commissioner, and has intimated to the local authorities concernedhis willingness to assist  them in a number of steps advantageous to trade and thearea.   In the third case, the Commissioners recommendation for some improvementof communications in West Cumberland has only recently been received, and theproposals are under examination with the highway authorities and the railwaycompanies.    58. For major proposals  of this kind, for which  substantial arguments on grounds  of traffic  as well as  arguments of a more  general nature, can be found,the existing machinery may  be said to fit the case.  Greater difficulty exists inconnection with proposals for which no substantial  justification  can be found on grounds of traffic, and which it would, therefore, be difficult to assist by grants from  the Road  Fund,  while refusing  assistance to similar  urban improvementselsewhere.    59. Such roads may be considered under two categories :            (i) First, roads wholly or mainly connected with Industrial Enterprises.       Normally, however, the Commissioners would wish  to help only  in cases       connected with schemes of industrial development such as Trading Estates,       or the new proposals with regard to site clearance, etc., and the difficulty
      can be met by arranging to finance the Estate Development Companies,      so as to enable them to negotiate with the Local Authority concerned with      a view to the Estate Company bearing the whole or part of the cost of making      up an existing highway  to the required standard.   The Estate Companies      could also be financed to enable them to meet the cost of new private roads,      which on completion would be taken over by the Local Authority.           (ii) Secondly, roads which are wholly or mainly residential streets.  The      need  for improving many of these which are in a deplorable condition in      many parts of the Special Areas is obvious as a matter of social improvement.      Their condition is also a deterrent to industrialists both because they observe      the cost which is likely to fall on the rates in due course and because of the      general  atmosphere of decay.    60. It  is recommended that steps should be  taken  to effect the necessaryimprovement, but it is considered to be important  to maintain the principle that two Departments, viz., in the  case of roads,  the  Ministry of Transport  and theCommissioner should not be responsible for the same service and it is  not recom-mended that this limitation of the powers of the Commissioners should be whollyset aside.      &apos; .    61. It is suggested that the existing Act should be amended in a strictly limitedsense.  It will suffice to provide that notwithstanding any existing limitation upon their powers the Commissioners should be entitled to make grants to  the recon-reconditioning of streets which, in the opinion of the Minister of Transport, have no value for through traffic and are of the nature of merely residential or local streets.    While it is not possible to frame any close estimate of the expenditure  likely tobe involved, an administrative limit of  250,000 would probably still enable themore urgent and serious deterioration to be put right.Private Residential Streets    62. The existence in the Special Areas of numerous private back streets whichare in a deplorable condition is a similar deterrent to industrialists to that presented by other residential streets in a bad condition.  Their improvement is also desirableas a measure of social improvement.    63. Normally, liability to make them up preparatory to their being taken overby the Local Authority rests on the frontagers.   In  a large number of cases theyare too poor to bear the whole burden but Local Authorities have power to assume the hability.  In these cases no  grant is  &quot; payable &quot; by another GovernmentDepartment and under the present Act the Commissioners have power to assist theLocal Authority.    64. The Commissioner has for England and Wales been already authorised togive assistance on the following basis in Rural Districts :            (1) The Local Authority to agree to bear 50 per cent, of the cost normally      to be borne by the frontagers.           (2) The Commissioner to relieve the Local Authority  of the whole of      this burden.           (3) The Commissioner also to assist the frontagers to meet the remaining       50 per cent, in cases of poverty and when the frontager is not an undertaking       carried on for gain.     65. The question of extending these arrangements to Urban Districts has beenunder consideration.  It is impossible to do more than guess at the total liabilitywhich might be involved, but if the present cases to be assisted were confined tothe most obvious ones, the commitment should not exceed  250,000 in both urban and Rural Districts or their equivalent  in Scotland.     66. In all the circumstances, it is recommended that the Commissioners shouldbe authorised to proceed with schemes in Rural and  Urban Districts, but that thecase of Boroughs should be reserved for further consideration. Equivalent local
limits should be observed in Scotland if it should be desired to proceed with schemesof this sort there.  This proposal does not require amending legislation but it hasbeen dealt with in this part of the Report owing to its close relationship to otherroad schemes.                              FIELD DRAINAGE    67. Sir George Gillett is considering whether he will recommend that he shouldassist schemes for field drainage, and if it should be decided that it would be appropriate to authorise such expenditure an amendment of the Act will be required.                           DURATION OF NEW ACT    68. The present policy of the Government aims at  the rehabilitation of theSpecial Areas mainly through the introduction of new industrial undertakings andit  has been said on many occasions that this is bound to be a slow process.   Themain driving power behind this policy is to be the offer of financial inducements toindustrialists beginning new undertakings. If has been recommended in paragraph 39that these inducements should be offered for a period of seven years, and this might suggest that the new Act should remain fully operative for at least this  period.On the other hand, there is the hope that in a much shorter time the Special areas will be so obviously on the road  to prosperity that it will no longer be necessary tooffer industrialists these inducements for further new undertakings.  It is suggested,therefore, that the Act itself should expire after two years on 31st March, 1939.At the same time, it should be made clear in the Act that the Commissioners havepower during its full operation to offer financial inducements for such periods asthey think fit within the seven years.
                                 PART II        PROPOSALS WHICH DO NOT REQUIRE  LEGISLATIONMary-port Harbour    69. The  entrance  to  the harbour was seriously damaged  in  the  winter of1935/36, and an examination of the position showed that not only were repairs to the entrance necessary but that if the harbour were to be brought into a properstate of repair the expenditure of some  200,000 would be necessary.   Moreover,the present traffic and that immediately in prospect would not produce sufficientrevenue to provide  for adequate maintenance  of the  reconditioned  docks and harbour.  Mr. Malcolm Stewart agreed that expenditure of  200,000 on the harbourcould not be justified solely on such economic requirements as could be immediatelyforeseen.    70. The  port  was extensively used during the last war,  but the Committeeof Imperial Defence  took the view that expenditure on the scale proposed wouldnot be justified on the grounds of its probable use in an emergency in the future.In such circumstances the full proposals have not been pursued.    71. If nothing is done, however, the harbour is likely to become derelict witha consequent increase in the depression in local industry owing to the fact that theexisting colliery would close and  that prospective colliery development would be prevented.   Mr. Malcolm Stewart then recommended and Sir G. Gillett supportshim, that expenditure should be  limited to that required to  secure the entranceagainst further damage by the reconstruction of the piers, etc.    72. The  estimated expenditure  is expected  to  be   70,000 or less, but  thefirst step is to secure a reliable estimate by employing an engineer to make  an investigation.  The fees payable  would  be about  2,000- 3,000, and  in all  thecircumstances it  is  considered  that it would  be  desirable  to carry out thisinvestigation.Welsh Smokeless Coal    73. The- Commissioners Report  refers to the use of Welsh  coal for domestic purposes and a recommendation is made that all houses over an agreed rateable value should not use in open hearths anything except Welsh or other  smokelesscoal or fuel.    74. A market for some  part  of the smokeless fuel produced in South wales has been created at  home during the past few years.  Leaving  Welsh anthraciteout of consideration, since it is a fuel of special characteristics, one of the strikingpost-war developments has been the installation in private houses of closed stovesfor water heating of the Sentry or Ideal type. These stoves burn coke or anthraciteor any other  form of smokeless fuel.  The South Wales coal-owners have  developed a steadily progressive trade in dry steam coals for use in these grates, the fuel beingwashed and in prepared sizes.    75. Since the Commissioners Report was issued the question of the availability of increased  supplies of Welsh dry steam coal has been discussed by  the MinesDepartment  with  the South  Wales coal-owners,  who have  stated that over  thecurrent year some 2/3 million tons more of this coal could be available for the market.A large proportion of  this tonnage would be of  prepared sizes, large coal  beingcrushed as may be necessary. This coal can be used in any grate in which cokecan be successfully burnt, but it is difficult to use it with success in the ordinaryopen grate.   Research work is being carried out  with the object of designing an open grate in which dry steam coal could be used efficiently.
    76. Reference to the technical Press shows that Welsh dry steam coal has beenregularly advertised.  It is understood that this advertising will be continued and developed.  Indeed, as the result of the discussions previously referred to, the pro-ducers of dry steam coal in South Wales are proposing to meet to discuss what further steps could be taken to increase the inland sales of  dry steam coal, par-ticularly in London and the South.  A  shortage of coke for industrial purposes which will be reflected in the domestic coke markets clearly offers an opportunityfor pushing the sales of Welsh dry steam coal.    77. It is recommended that the  Government should continue to attempt to foster the use of this type of coal,  but it is not possible to contemplate legislation to make its use  compulsory for  domestic purposes,  particularly in view of  thepresent difficulty in burning it in the  ordinary open grate.Land  Settlement Smallholdings    78. Land settlement is often advocated as a measure which should be adopted on a large scale to provide employment for unemployed industrial workers from theSpecial  Areas or elsewhere. The transfer, however, of industrial workers to  theland is  not a simple walkover, since it is by no means everyone who would be suitable or likely to make a success of a smallholding even after training.  A small-holding will certainly  afford full-time employment, but whether it will providea reasonable livelihood is a question which could not be determined without furtherexperience.    79. In a recent report made to the-Carnegie United Kingdom Trustees,  theconclusion was reached that a  large scale policy of land settlement in this country could not be justified on economic grounds, and could have little influence in solving the problem of unemployment.    80. The late Commissioner for England and Wales recognised this point ofview and stated that the policy of land settlement must be pursued with caution.In all the circumstances he was then of opinion that schemes for some 2,000 familiesshould be sufficient to afford reliable information and guidance for future action.This figure is the basis of present policy.    81. The programme of Land Settlement which is being carried out with assistance from the Special Areas Fund in England and Wales is as follows :     Land Settlement Association                                    Families.           (a) Schemes towards which the Special Areas Fund contri-      butes 33^ per cent, and the Land Settlement Association raises      66f per cent.......     ..........     100           (The Schemes were originally for 240  families but, as they      cannot be completed on the above basis at present, group (b) has      been increased by 140  from  1,000.)           (b) Schemes towards which the Special Areas Fund contri-      butes 100 per cent.   ..      ..     ..     ..     ..     ..     ..    1,140           (c) Schemes to which the County Council of Northumberland      contribute with assistance from the Special Areas Fund  . .     ..     200    Welsh Land Settlement Society Limited            Provisional Programme. .     . .     .  .     . .     ..     . .     500    Assistance is also being given towards a series of small schenes of land settlementorganised by the Durham County Council.  At present these schemes  providefor some 120 families, but extensions  are contemplated.    82. The Welsh Land Settlement Society is not yet within sight of completing the provisional programme for 500 families, but the Land Settlement Associationexpect to complete recruitment of  the families for the schemes for which they are directly responsible, viz., for 1,240 families, towards the end of  1937.    83, The estimated expenditure from the Special Areas Fund is  2,000,000.
     84. There  is an appreciable interval inevitable between a decision to seekfurther suitable estates and the time when it becomes possible to recruit persons for settlement, and the late Commissioner recommended that authority should begiven for an extension  of the programme so that the Land Settlement Associationcould continue in the  market for suitable sites.     85. At the 30th September, 1936, no more than 11  families had  actuallycompleted their training and these only began an independent existence a fewmonths ago.  It is true that experience to date may warrant a degree of optimism,but it is far from possible to say that there is any reliable information which would justify the assumption that land settlement will be a success.  In fact, it will notbe possible to reach any really reliable conclusion until a fair sample of the settlershave been on their own feet for some two or three years.     86. The extension of the programme is, however, urged not on the groundthat success is assured, but on the ground that  the results  to date warrant an expansion of the original experimental programme on its merits.  It cannot nowbe alleged that 2,000 families is too small a group with which to conduct a practicaltest of the possibilities of land settlement, and in view of the limited experience gained so far, and of the known risks, it is arguable that it would be desirable to defer a decision on an  expansion of the size of the experiment until at least somesettlers have got through a winter on their own resources.     87. In the meantime the Land Settlement Association  has been  authorisedto secure land for the four additional estates which will be required for the increaseof schemes in category (6) above, to take the place of the schemes in category (a)which could not be pursued.  To this extent the scope of the experiment has alreadybeen enlarged as a result of the recent recommendation of the Commissioner.  Onthe other hand, it would probably be considered to be undesirable from a political point of view to cease  to offer facilities for land settlement unless and until it  isshown to be a failure, and in such circumstances it is recommended that the Govern-ment should announce  that the Commissioner has  been authorised to proceed withan extension up to a total of 3,000 families on the understanding that  the resultsof the experiment generally will be reviewed in  the autumn of 1938.Cottage Homesteads     88. The Land Settlement Association,  which is undertaking the transference of men from the Special Areas to holdings in the Midlands and the South of England,has found, by  experience, that there is a considerable number of men who, chieflyon account of age, are not suitable for full-time holdings.  In many cases these menare unlikely to obtain  ordinary employment again, and some thousands  of them have been put  on what is known as group holdings in the  Special Areas.   Theseconsist of groups of holdings of up to half an acre upon which poultry are kept and vegetables are  grown.   The group  holder  continues to draw his unemploymentallowance, which is unaffected by the small sales of produce from the holding whichmay be surplus to family requirements.     89. Many of the men on group holdings have  growing families who have greatdifficulty in obtaining work so long as they remain in the Special Areas, and reluctance to breaking  up  the family is often a serious obstacle to the transference  of the younger members to other areas where they would obtain employment.     90. It is  proposed, therefore, to  adopt  Recommendation No.  16  of theCommissioner^ recent  Report and to set up a number of these holdings completewith a new house and the necessary outbuildings near the more prosperous centres in the Midlands and the South.  This new type of holding will be known as &quot; CottageHomesteads.&quot;   Very probably the householder  will not secure employment in thenew district  and the financial basis of the Scheme assumes that he will not.  the rent that he will pay will be sufficient to cover all charges,  including interest and sinking fund on the capital cost of the Scheme, and in so far as his unemploymentallowance will be reducible owing to the earnings  of members of his family, therewill be  an actual saving in  the early years.  Moreover, what is more important,these younger persons will  become self-supporting members of the community.Later,  when the children marry and leave home, there may be an increase in theunemployment allowances owing to operation of the rent rule.
    91. The holdings will be kept separate from the houses so that the land can be properly utilised when the householder ceases to be able, owing to failing health,to make proper use of it.  : 92. The Scheme is really one more of social  improvement and transferencethan of land settlement and, on the whole,  the Scheme is regarded as one whichshould be accepted as an experiment.  In the first instance it would be desirable to begin on a modest scale, and it has been agreed that 250 families would afford asuitable beginning.   Arrangements are also being made so  that  a substantial increase in  the size of the experiment could be made without difficulty if the earlyresults seemed to justify it.    The acceptance  of this recommendation has already been announced in theHouse of Commons.Welsh National Park    93. The Commissioner made an earlier recommendation for the establishmentwith tne aid of the Special Areas Fund of a Welsh National Park, the site of whichwas to  be outside the Special Areas, but apart from the  question whether such assistance could or could not be given under the Special Areas Act, the Governmentreached the conclusion that the expenditure could not be justified having regard tothe negligible amount of employment which would be provided directly or indirectlyfor persons from the Special Areas.    94. Mr. Malcolm Stewart in his Third Report recommended the establishmentof a National  Park within the Special Areas.   The site proposed is at the head ofthe Vale of Neath, and consists of  27 square  miles which  contain beautiful riverscenery and waterfalls, and it is  surrounded by moorland country which would be suitable ground for exploration,  etc., by visitors who would be accommodated incamps, hostels and/or hotels within  the Park itself.    95. It is doubtful whether even this scheme for a Park within  the borders ofthe Welsh Special Areas could be justified by reason of the amount of employmentlikely to be provided, but it is also  urged on the ground that it will help to securesocial contact  between the more  prosperous parts of the  country and the SpecialAreas, and will tend to gratify Welsh National sentiment.    96. The scheme merits further consideration, but it  cannot  be claimed to beof first-class importance, and announcement of acceptance at the present moment,except in conjunction with something else of a really substantial  nature, might lead to  the complaint that the people want work and they are offered a recreationground.    97. This view has. been confirmed by Sir George Gillett, who thinks it wouldbe a mistake to undertake a scheme for a National Park in South Wales if nothing else is done.  If, however, there is a  forward movement on all fronts  to attract new industries and give more employment, he thinks that the establishment of a NationalPark would be a useful addition to  other efforts to attract  tourist traffic to SouthWales as part of the general development scheme.    98. Captain Crawshay, the District Commissioner for Wales, has now suggestedthat if the Government would put up  100,000 for the scheme, he himself and his friends  would endeavour to raise another  100,000.    99. It is recommended that this offer should be accepted and that in conjunctionwith the general announcements in connection with  the amending legislation,  theGovernment should  say that they  have accepted the proposal on condition that local interests are prepared to subscribe 50 per cent,  of the cost of acquisition anddevelopment up to a maximum of   200,000, subject to their being satisfied withthe general plans for development.
Additional Physical Training    100. Among the measures advocated by the Commissioner for improving the lot of the unemployed in the Special Areas was  the provision of physical trainingclasses,  and at his  request the Ministry of  Labour undertook the task, the costbeing met from the funds of the Commissioner.   A start was made in March, 1936,when 15 Physical  Training Classes, with nearly 2,500 men attending them, were opened.  The  classes were  received with enthusiasm by the men themselves, andthe facilities were  extended ; there are now 33  classes with nearly 4,500 men  in attendance.  In all nearly  10,000 men in the Special Areas have, at one stage  or another, attended the classes.  (Classes have been  provided in Scotland with over2,000 men in attendance, the cost being met from the funds of the Commissionerfor Scotland.)    101. In addition to these classes the National Council of Social Service providephysical training in many of their Occupational Centres in the Special Areas. close co-operation is maintained between the Ministry  and the National Council to avoid unnecessary competition and overlapping of physical training facilities  in theSpecial  Areas.    102. It  is recommended that the  provision oi physical training facilities forthe unemployed in  the Special Areas should be  extended,  where the need exists.Further developments should be co-ordinated so  far as necessary with the national scheme of Physical  Training already under consideration.Improvement of Instructional Centres    103. The  Commissioner^ recommendation,  that the proportion  of  men fromthe Special  Areas who  are placed in  employment on the satisfactory  completionof a course  at an  Instructional Centre should be  greatly increased,  and that,  tothis end, work should be provided in connection  with the Trunk Road programme,requires consideration in relation  to the transfer position generally.    104. Between   1st  January,   1935,  and 31st October, 1936, nearly  50,000persons-23,174 men, 10,090 women, 9,184 boys, and 7,341 girls were  transferred from  the Special Areas through  the  machinery of the Ministry of Labour.   Inaddition, large numbers of men are known to transfer on  their own account andthe total  number of men  from the Special Areas  who have secured employmentelsewhere over the period of 22 months mentioned is probably upwards of 50,000,and the total number of persons who have transferred from the Areas to employmentmust be at least 80,000.     105. Prior to  1st  September, 1935,  figures  are not available for the SpecialAreas, to show separately direct transfers, transfers through Government TrainingCentres and through Instructional Centres, but of 17,197 men transferred from theSpecial Areas through the Employment Exchanges during the period 1st September,1935  to 31st October,  1936, 10,909 were transferred direct to employment, 4,879after  a  course at a Government  Training Centre,  and 1,409 after  a course at  anInstructional Centre.     106. The  Government Training Centres give  suitable  young men  the oppor-tunity of taking a  course of training in a skilled  trade, and practically all the menwho satisfactorily complete courses are placed in employment.   Men who are not suitable for transfer direct to employment,  or, by lack of aptitude or knowledge,for a  course at a Government Training Centre, may attend an Instructional Centre,where they receive  a course designed to restore their  fitness for employment.  It isnot easy to find employment for  these men, since  they are not equipped with anyspecial skill, but every effort is made to find openings for them.  The  percentageof men completing courses  who secured employment was 40 per cent,  in the Springand early Summer of  1936.  During  several other months, however, the numberof openings was restricted  by bad weather ;  at the same time, a larger number ofmen completed courses and, as a result, the percentage of men from the SpecialAreas who obtained employment from the Centres  over the first  10  months  of1936  was only 22 per cent.  The records for 1935 make no distinction between
men from the Special Areas  and those from elsewhere and no exact comparisoncan be made, but for all men  completing  courses at Instructional Centres 3,622men obtained employment in the first 10 months of 1936 compared with 2,803 inthe corresponding period of 1935.    107. Plans are in train  for broadening the curriculum at the InstructionalCentres,  and proposals  are shortly to be laid before the Treasury for providing a new type of training designed to give the men a factory sense which should enablethem to take advantage of the increasing number of openings in factory employment.Arrangements of various kinds have  also been made to secure full benefit fromthe improvement in employment for men from the  Special Areas  who have takencourses at the Instructional Centres.    108. The Ministry of Labour has been in  consultation with  the Ministry ofTransport about openings on the Trunk Road programme for men from the Centres,and arrangements will be made under which Contractors undertaking new workon the Trunk Roads will be required  to engage all workpeople (other than a per-centage  for supervisory purposes) through the  Employment  Exchanges.  TheExchanges will take every opportunity to submit suitable men from the  Instruc-tional Centres for this work, with a preference,  other things being equal,  for menfrom the Special Areas.       &apos; *
                                 PART III           PROPOSALS REQUIRING FURTHER EXAMINATIONOil from Coal     In his Third Report, Mr. Malcolm Stewart recommended that :-           (a) The  Government should financially assist the  erection of plants       for extraction of oil from coal in the Special Areas.           (5) All processes for the production of oil from coal might with advantage       be brought under some degree of State Control.     109. During recent years  definite  steps  have been taken to stimulate, theproduction of oil products  by the treatment of coal and coal products, shale, etc.,by allowing substantial preferences to such oil products.   In the case of motor spirit, there is a preference of 8d. a gallon and, under the British Hydrocarbon OilsProduction Act, 1934, a preference of not less than Ad. a gallon is guaranteed fora period of years.  On heavy oils the preference is Id. a gallon, and in the case ofsuch oils used for road transport, 8d. a gallon, but at present there is no guaranteedpreference.  Further,  very large sums are expended each year on research work,including large  scale work,  some of which is carried to  a stage immediately preceding commercial development.     110. There has been during the last three or four years a considerable  increasein the home production of motor spirit.  The figures of production are :                                                         Million gallons             1932  .............     38J             1933       ............     44             1934       ............     54f             1935       ..     ........     ..     76This production, which for 1935 represents about 6 per cent, of present consumption,includes  benzol  from coke ovens and gas works,  motor spirit obtained by thehydrogenation process and low temperature carbonisation of coal, and from theshale oil industry.    The production of heavy oils during the same years has  been :                                                        Million gallons             1932       ............     62             1933       .............     72             1934       .............     89             1935       ............-   93Billingham Process    111. The  capital cost would be approximately  8,000,000.   The cost to theExchequer (after allowing for the saving of unemployment pay) would be about 1,500,000 a year for the  first  ten  years, and  employment would be provided,directly and indirectly, for about  6,000 men.  At the end of the ten years therewould be a plant costing  8,000,000, written down to scrap value and still capableof producing petrol at the original cost but possibly not fully abreast of technicalprogress.    112. Such a plant would be an  important factor in the provision of suppliesof aviation spirit in war time, and this aspect of the problem, including the relativesafety, other advantages and cost  of spirit produced  at home from coal comparedwith those of the storage of reserves, is now under consideration by the Committeeof Imperial Defence and Ministry for Co-ordination of Defence.
Fischer Process     113. This is another process for the production of oil from coal which has theemployment advantages of the Billingham process, but the investigation into theprocess has not proceeded far enough to enable its value to be compared financiallyand strategetically with those of the Billingham process.Low Temperature Carbonisation     114. Negotiations are proceeding  with  interested parties with a view to theerection of a low temperature carbonisation plant in  South Wales, but they havenot yet reached any very definite stage.Calcium Carbide     115. The  Commissioner in his Report (paragraph 35) refers to the possibilityof the production of calcium carbide in South  Wales and states that preliminaryinvestigations  made  for him by a competent firm of engineers indicate that theproduction of carbide using electricity generated from  steam power is a commercialpossibility.  This material, which is not made in the United Kingdom, has a wide range of industrial uses, among the most important of which is in the productionof acetylene gas for oxy-acetylene cutting  and welding.     116. Its  economic production  depends mainly upon the  provision of cheapelectricity, and it is therefore made in Scandinavia and elsewhere on the continent and  in North  America where water-power is available.  The British OxygenCompany  (the  largest users of carbide in this  country) have promoted a  schemefor the production of carbide  at  hydro-electric works to be  established  in the highlands  of  Scotland.   The  Company have  not hitherto asked for a subsidyor tariff protection in connection with  this scheme. The  Bill giving the necessary powers was rejected  last Session but is being re-introduced.     117. The  interested Departments  have  urged upon the British Oxygen Com-pany the desirability of making carbide in the Special Areas if possible, but theCompany  are  hot prepared  to  accept  the Commissioners statement.  They have so far been unable to obtain power in South Wales at a price comparable with theestimated production&apos; cost in the Highlands and, moreover, it is not yet established that the Company are satisfied that  the limestones readily  available in SouthWales are  entirely suitable for their  purpose.  These points  are, however,  still under  investigation.     118. Meanwhile,  other  interests  are  considering the  possibility of makingcarbide in South Wales,  although their  scheme  appears to depend  upon  some financial assistance and some  guarantee of protection against imported carbide.Under the Anglo-Norwegian  Trade Agreement  carbide  is accorded  free entry,and  as the Norwegians  attach considerable importance to this and to  similar concessions on other electric furnace products,  it will  not be easy  to induce themto agree to any variation of the present position in the negotiations for a revisionof the Agreement which will be undertaken shortly.Control of Expansion of Industry in Greater London     119. Mr. Malcolm Stewart suggests (paragraph 22  of Report) that the establish-ment of new factories and  the extension of existing factories  in the  Greater london area should be prohibited except under licence.  It is arguable, however,  that toimpose legal control  in Greater London but not elsewhere would involve drawingan untenable distinction between different parts of the country, and that a systemof control which would be inequitable if applied to a part of the country only mightbe considered  practicable for the country  as a  whole.  Moreover, it appears fairlycertain that if the prohibition were confined  to Greater London, the excludedundertakings  would  establish  themselves either  just outside the forbidden area(in order  to  be as close  as possible to their chief market) or in  such places asBirmingham and other prosperous districts, rather  than in the areas of heavyunemployment. The proposal,  therefore, would almost certainly involve the control
of the establishment of new undertakings and of the extension of existing under-takings in many areas, if not throughout the country ; and its practical applicationwould be little different from the compulsory location of industry which Mr. Stewarthimself condemns as &quot; unnecessary and dangerous &quot;  (paragraph 19 of the Report).    120. The Government  are, however,  pledged to give the  proposal  careful examination and it is accordingly necessary to consider all its implications.  before considering: whether a  public inquiry would be advantageous and., if so, what formit should take and what should be  its terms of reference, it may be useful (withoutattempting to discuss the matter exhaustively) to note  some  of  the  practical problems to which a system of legal control of the location of industrial development would give rise.    121. The simplest machinery of control would no doubt be to empower an existing Government Department (possibly in consultation with other Departments)or a new Statutory Board or Commission to grant licences and to make it an offence to proceed with an  industrial project without a licence.  Difficult questions to besettled before the licensing system could be established would be :            (i) whether the system should (as  Mr. Stewart contemplated) cover      extensions of existing or licensed factories ;           (ii)  the minimum size of the undertakings to be subject to control;           (iii) whether small exempted factories could expand above the minimum      without licence  ; and           (iv) whether a change of user of existing buildings would constitute a      new undertaking.    122. A prohibition of new industrial undertakings or of wide classes of under-takings over large portions of the country is outside the scope of town and country planning as at present administered by Local Authorities.   Any such system ofcontrol would have to be operated by a Central Authority and  any expenditure involved, whether by way of compensation or otherwise, be borne on central funds.Moreover, the  prohibition of industries under present planning administration is limited to areas which, on general grounds of convenience and amenity, are unsuitedfor that purpose.  The proposed control would  have to rule out  sites  which wereeminently suited for industrial purposes  (and  possibly for little else), including,e.g., sites purchased and laid out by Railway Companies with the specific objectof attracting industry.    123. Heavy claims for compensation from owners of such sites may be expected;and in cases where land had already been acquired by industrialists with the objectof erecting factories for their own manufacturing purposes the claims would beirresistible.    124. If the aim is to prevent an increase in population in certain areas, the licensing authority  could  hardly restrict themselves to dealing with applicationsad hoc, but would be forced into a general pronouncement that certain areas wereruled  out for industrial purposes.  Any such pronouncement might have a serious effect on the value of the land in the area, and it seems doubtful whether the equityof compensating land owners could be gainsaid.   If so, the State would be paying for land values which are not destroyed but are, to a large extent,  transferred fromone area of land to another.  Short of a system of public ownership of land, itmay be doubted whether any method can be devised for securing that  the owners ofthe land enhanced in value will recoup to the State its expenditure on compensation.    125.  It is also to be expected  that compensation for loss of anticipated profitswouid be demanded by industrialists who, having been refused licences, decided toabandon their manufacturing projects ;  while industrialists diverted to uncontrolledareas  would  certainly  expect the Government  to make good  their losses if  their undertakings failed.    126. The licensing system would certainly clog industrial  development in thecountry as a whole.   The location of a new industrial undertaking involves economicand technical considerations of great complexity, and it would not be easy for the
licensing authority to obtain that disinterested expert advice which  would benecessary to enable it to judge whether any particular project which came before ithad a reasonable chance of success outside the controlled areas.    127. In view of the foregoing considerations  and of Mr. Stewarfs observationsin paragraph 19 of his Report, it seems doubtful  whether a public inquiry into thequestion of statutory control of the location of industry is worth while or desirable.If, however, public inquiry into that question is  decided on, the terms of reference might be -           &quot; To consider whether it is practicable and desirable in the national      interest to control the location of new  industries, and if so what  measures      should be adopted for  that  purpose ;  and to make recommendations.&quot;    128. Mr. Stewart&apos;s recommendation was, however, based on an Appendix tohis Report dealing mainly with the growth of population of &quot; Greater London &quot; andthe difficulties (of transport,  defence, etc.) arising therefrom.  There is something to be said for a public inquiry into the causes of the drift of population towardsLondon.  Such  an inquiry would probably show  that  the establishment of new industrial undertakings is not the main factor in  the increase of population.   [Thisis the  conclusion  indicated by a  comparison between the employment directlyprovided by new  factories (excluding  those employing less than 25 workpeople)opened in 1935, and the increase between June, 1935, and June, 1936, in the numberof insured persons in employment in the London  and South-Eastern Divisions ;  thefigures are 21,000 and  190,000, respectively.]   It would probably  be  found thatfactors such as the attractions of London as a commercial, financial, and administra-tive centre and  the social amenities of  the South-Eastern  corner of England, arecollectively  more important.    If an inquiry on these lines is thought desirable,the terms of reference might be            &quot; To enquire into the  causes of, and the difficulties arising from, the      tendency for the population to concentrate in the neighbourhood of London       (and in the South-East of England) ;  and to report whether, and if so what,      measures should  be taken in  the national interest  to  counteract that      tendency.&quot;It would probably be beyond the competence of the investigating body to go deeplyinto defence considerations,  but  the  views  of  the  Service Departments  on thedefence  aspects  would  no doubt have  to be taken into  account  in making recommendations.     129. Either subject that of  compulsory location of industry  or that  of thegrowth of London appears  to be of sufficient importance to warrant  the  settingup of a Royal Commission.   Such a course would  involve much delay, and theGovernment might be accused of shelving consideration of Mr. Stewards  recom-mendation.  Most of the  factors on  which  a  decision would depend  could beconsidered and presented to the Government by the various Departments concernedin the shape of  a  confidential Report in much less time than  a Royal commission would occupy.     130. On the  other  hand, Mr.  Stewards proposal raises  questions so wide,difficult and contentious that the preparation of the necessary clauses in time forthe Bill which is to be introduced after the Recess  is  hardly  practicable, and thesubject  matter  of the clauses would be inappropriate  to  a Bill dealing with theSpecial  Areas.   Moreover, inquiry by  a Royal  Commission might suggest usefulaction short of  statutory control, and  would in any case  disclose the attitude ofindustrialists and other interests affected.   It would, moreover, have considerableeducational value in bringing to light the full implications of the proposal, whilethe publicity which  would be given to the disadvantages of concentration - near london might act as a deterrent.     131. In all the  circumstances it  is recommended that a Royal commission should  be set up with terms of reference on the lines of the second alternativesuggested above.  Another matter, however, which must not be lost sight of in considering a problem of this nature, is the fact that owing to the low  birth-ratein recent years the  population of this  country  will  inevitably begin to  decline in
1956 or so, and,  moreover, even if there should be a spectacular increase in the birth-rate in the immediate future, it is understood that this would probably notavert a continued reduction for some time after the prospective reduction had begun.Survey to determine Derelict Areas.    132. Broadly speaking the  Special Areas can properly be regarded as falling into three categories :            (i)  Areas which are already showing substantial recovery  and may       reasonably be expected, with the introduction of new industries, to  attain       a proper measure of prosperity.           (ii) Areas which although not  offering any very  great attractions to       new industries,  must be regarded as areas where it would be  reasonable       to expect a fair  measure of recovery.           (iii) Areas which for geographical or other reasons appear to offer no       hope of recovery, e.g., places situated in hilly country, off main routes of       communication  which may be said  to have no excuse for existence except       as agricultural villages apart from  their mineral resources, which can no       no longer be worked economically or which are in fact exhausted.    133. In paragraph 11  of  his  Third  Report,  the  Commissioner renews therecommendation made in paragraph 197 of his First Report, that such parts of theSpecial Areas as offer little or no hope of revival should be broadly determined anda survey made to ascertain the possibilities  of their industrial revival. He suggestedthat a survey should be undertaken by an impartial independent authority with whom  the Trade Unions should be associated and that areas whose prospects werehopeless should be evacuated.    134. This proposal was considered by the Inter-Departmental Committee inAugust, 1935, who pointed out that there were great political and practical diffi-culties in  contemplating an overt and formal declaration  that  a particular placeis derelict and the matter was not pursued.    135. At that time there were few, if any, signs of revival in the Special Areas,but the present revival is showing itself to be confined to certain districts and thefact that some of  the others are truly derelict is now becoming increasingly clear.The continued existence of these derelict areas, even when large parts of the SpecialAreas have been rehabilitated, will keep alive the problem of the Special Areas as apolitical issue and proposals  for uneconomic  public works  will be increasingly difficult to resist.    136. Regulated and compulsory evacuation  even  only to  places  at a short distance, e.g., from South West Durham to the  Tyneside,  would be somewhatdrastic but it looks as though the problem  may have to be  faced in due  course.    137. As a first step, however, it seems necessary that the Government should place itself in  possession of more detailed information than it already possesses, sothat the full scope of the problem and the means to be adopted can be determined on something  more than generalities.    138. The Ministry of Labour is already  arranging for  an analysis of the live register district  by district with a view  to determining the number  of persons(mainly miners aged 50 and upwards) who may be regarded as so unlikely to secureemployment again that they may be regarded as unemployable. This will, however,give only  one aspect of the problem.  The late Commissioner had arranged for a survey of South West Durham from an Industrial point of view, see paragraph 145of his Third Report, and it is proposed that the new Commissioner should arrangefor  similar reports to be obtained in respect of such other potentially derelict partsof the Special  Areas as he might deem desirable.
                                 PART IV                             MISCELLANEOUS                Removal of Unemployables from the Live Register ,    139. Recommendation No. 6 in the Third Report of the Commissioner is that consideration should be given to the possibility of removing from the Live Registerthose who have been out of work for over five years and are never  likely again toobtain  employment.  It is admitted that there are a number of men, mainly those over age 50, who are so unlikely to obtain work again that they may properly beregarded as outside the  industrial field.  This situation is found mainly in  miningdistricts. There is no advantage, however, in removing them from the Live Registersimply by not counting them as unemployed and any attempt to do so would meet with considerable political opposition.  Moreover, it would remove  them from thescope of the Unemployment Assistance Act.    140. If the proposal means more than this, it implies that some  sort of pension scheme should  be provided which  could hardly be confined to the Special Areas.In effect, such men receive pensions in  the form of Unemployment AssistanceAllowances and anyone advocating a scheme of pensions would presumably askfor something more generous.  There would  be serious repercussions which might involve an increase  in the scale of  contributory and other old age pensions whichare payable at age of 65 and 70 respectively.    141. In the past, schemes to provide pensions to all at age 60, irrespective oftheir industrial efficiency, have been  considered and it was calculated  that  anyreasonably fair scheme, capable of removing from the field of employment the mainproportion of workers who are age 60 or over, would involve additional taxation ofat least  100,000,000 a year. A charge of this amount upon the country&apos;s resources would  only have an adverse effect on employment generally and the scheme was rejected. It is not possible to gauge the magnitude of the cost of a scheme to  dealonly with those who may in present  circumstances  be regarded  as  outside- the reasonable possibility of industrial employment although still regarded as &quot; capableof and available for work &quot; and  it is recommended that the suggestion shouldnot be pursued.Compulsory Attendance at Instructional Centres    142. Recommendation No. 18 in the Third  Report of the Commissioner  isthat, if the recommendation about improving the prospects of men from Instruc-tional  Centres (see paragraphs 107 and  108) is accepted and put into operation,attendance at Instructional Centres on  the part  of young men from the SpecialAreas should no longer remain on a voluntary basis but be subject to  an approvedmeasure of compulsion.   It is hoped that these prospects will be  improved to a material degree but  it is  considered that the  time is not yet  ripe to adopt the compulsory measures proposed.Empire Migration    143. The Commissioner has also recommended that settlement in the BritishEmpire overseas should be resumed as soon as possible.    The fall in Empire migration during the past six years has been due to adverseeconomic conditions which have prevailed in the Dominions no less than in otherparts  of the world.  The importance of this question has been fully realised, andan  Inter-Departmental Committee  on Migration  Policy  appointed  under theChairmanship of  Mr.  Malcolm MacDonald to survey the situation,  presented itsreport (Cmd. 4689) in  August, 1934.
     144. The Report was referred to the Oversea Governments for their observa-tions,  since  any resumption  of the migration  movement  must necessarily  be dependant upon those Governments being able and willing to receive new migrants,and  to co-operate  in schemes  of  assisted migration.  Generally speaking,  theattitude of the Oversea Governments was that they would welcome the resumptionof migration at the proper time and on suitable lines but that conditions were notat the moment favourable for such  a resumption.     145. In  February, 1936, in accordance with one  of the recommendations ofthe  Inter-Departmental  Committee on  Migration Policy, the United KingdomGovernment appointed the  Oversea Settlement  Board &quot; to consider and advise the Secretary of State upon  specific proposals for schemes of migration within theEmpire and upon any matter relating to  oversea settlement which may be referredto it by him.&quot;     146. In  an Interim  Report presented  to  Parliament  in November,  1936(Cmd. 5314), the Board stated that on a preliminary  view of  the situation, theywere  encouraged to think that  certain oversea  Governments  might  be  preparedto co-operate in schemes for  the gradual revival of assisted migration along certaincertain lines.  Meanwhile, a recommendation of the Board that the Empire Settle-ment Act, 1922, which expires on 31st May,  1937, should be  renewed, has beenaccepted by the Government and steps are being taken to introduce the necessarjrlegislation.Special Commissioners or a Minister     147. In giving consideration  to  proposals  to assist the Special Areas and what amendments to the Act of 1934 seem desirable,  it is necessary  to settle thequestion  whether the Special Commissioners should be retained or whether a cabinet minister should be appointed to deal exclusively with the problem. In paragraph 43of his Third  Report, Mr. Malcolm  Stewart  points  out  the  disadvantages of thepresent arrangements, and in paragraph 44 he hints somewhat strongly that since itwould be wrong to give a  Commissioner  not directly responsible to parliamentary free hartd with the funds available, it would  be better to have direct admini-stration by  a Minister.  In the Debate in the House of Lords  on 15th December,1936, several speakers advocated the appointment of a Minister without portfolio.     148. Practically the whole field of expenditure from the Special Areas Fundlies within the purview of one or another of the existing Government departments and for each sphere of policy within the field there is already a Minister responsible to Parliament.  To have a  separate Cabinet Minister  responsible  for  all thesematters in the Special Areas so far as the Special Areas Fund is concerned and toleave the other aspects of the same  service under the present Ministers might veryeasily lead to difficulties.Separate  Commissioner for Wales     149.  The Special Areas Act empowers  the Ministry of  Labour, with theconsent of the Treasury, to appoint a  Deputy  Commissioner if representationsurging that course have been made to him by the Commissioner.  The Commissionerhas in fact appointed three  non-statutory  District Commissioners, one of  whom,Captain Crawshay,  acts as his representative in South Wales.  Captain Crawshayis universally respected and popular, though  certain critics have maintained thathe  has  not got enough industrial  experience.   Any failure  in this respect  is,however, now fully covered  by the recent appointment of Industrial  advisers to the Commissioner.     150. Whilst there is a separate Commissioner for  Scotland, the case of wales is readily distinguishable on practical,  if  not so  easily  on sentimental  grounds.Most Government activities  in Scotland  are carried out by Scottish departments which are  separate from those in  England  and Wales.   These Departments areresponsible to the Secretary of State for  Scotland who has an office in Edinburgh,whereas in Wales operations are conducted from Whitehall.   (There  is a separateWelsh Board of Health but this is responsible to the Minister  of Health in London.)
    151. The  Appointment of two Commissioners,  one for  England and wales and the other for Scotland does give rise to  difficulties owing to a tendency todivergence of policy and these would be accentuated if there were also a separateCommissioner  for Wales.  There is a clear need for a common line of policy withregard to  the Special Areas.  Moreover, the Commissioner has found it necessaryto have frequent contact  at short notice with several Government  departments in London.  The Scottish Commissioner  can  meet a similar need owing  to the location of Scottish Departments in Edinburgh, but a Welsh Commissioner locatedpresumably in Cardiff  would  be severely  handicapped  through lack of direct contact with the appropriate Departments in London.    152. The  Commissioner is fully informed of Welsh feeling and aspirationsthrough the District Commissioner, and apart from National sentiment there is nothing to be said in favour of a separate  Commissioner for Wales.       -    153. The  proposal  for a separate  Commissioner  for Wales  has  on several occasions been accompanied by the suggestion that he should have wide independentpowers, but so long as  a  Minister remains responsible to Parliament, and this is inevitable, an autonomous  Welsh Commissioner  cannot be contemplated.  It issuggested that any further pressure in this direction should be met by a referenceto the much wider scope of the action which  will be possible under  the proposedamending legislation, e.g. financial inducements to new industrial undertakings.
                                 APPENDIX I            NOTE ON THE  ADJUSTMENT OF THE SCHEDULED  AREAS     1. Before proceeding to an examination of  the claims of individual districtsfor inclusion in the Bill, it is desired to draw attention to a number of considerations of a general nature, which, it is thought, must influence and, to  some extent,restrict the field from which any proposed new areas can reasonably be drawn.  Inthe first  place, any  area which it is proposed to include  for  the first time must clearly not  only  have experienced  prolonged and severe  unemployment over aconsiderable period  in  the  past,  but must also  be continuing to suffer from theeffects of industrial depression, and must  have no prospect of making a substantialrecovery in the immediate  future ; secondly,  in making  a choice  of new areas,it is desirable to avoid, so far as is practicable, the administrative difficulties whichwould be involved in applying the Act to a large number of separate and industriallyindependent areas and at the same time to ensure that any  area to which it isproposed to extend the provisions of the Act is of such a  homogeneous  character and substantial size as to make the application of the Act to it practicable ; thirdly,the area must be one to which  the provisions  of the Act can  appropriately  beapplied, since there are many areas in which the ostensible indices of unemploymentare high but  in  which the application of the Commissioners&apos; powers in respectof matters such  as economic development would be of no effect;  and fourthly,it is essential to avoid drawing any extension of the areas on too wide a basis,since the more  broadly the  assistance afforded by the  Act in particular  theassistance for stimulating economic development is dispersed,  the  less  effectivethe provisions of the Act must be in bringing relief to the areas which are mostin need.    2. An examination has accordingly been made in the  light of these factors ofthe suitability for inclusion in the amending  Bill of  the areas in  the country as a whole, in which there is some evidence of persistent and continuing industrialdepression, including- those areas in respect of which claims for  inclusion have beenpreferred.  The areas of the type  last mentioned, i.e. those which have requestedinclusion or expressed  regret at  non-inclusion in the  Schedule  of  Special Areasor which  it is clear from other evidence will  undoubtedly press their claim for inclusion, are as follows :                        Areas which have asked for inclusion                                   EnglandCounty.

In  order that some measure  of  comparison may be afforded  between industrial conditions  in  theproposed new areas and in the  present Special Areas,  a statement  is appendedhereto showing the average rate of unemployment during  the  past  5 years  and during 1936 in the areas at present scheduled, together with the rate of unemploy-ment  recorded  at  December, 1936.  The rates of unemployment  in the  severalareas,  whether  calculated  over  the past five years or  during  1936, are  widelydivergent, but the position may  be summarised as follows : Number of Employment Exchange Areas in the Special Areas in which the average                         Rate of Unemployment was-                   (a) During the 5 years ended October,  1936Per cent.

Table (a) indicates that during the past
five years the average rate of unemployment has been 25 per cent, or more in allthe employment exchange areas (with the exception of three small offices) in SouthWales and West Cumberland, but that only about 80 per cent, of the employment exchange areas in Scotland and the North-East Coast satisfied this  test.    The relatively more favourable employment position in  the Special Areas ofScotland and the North-East  Coast is even more pointedly illustrated by Table (b).That  table shows  that only three of the 45 Employment Exchange Areas in theSpecial Areas.of South Wales and West Cumberland recorded an average rate ofunemployment during 1936  of less  than 20 per  cent, but that in 20 out of the42 employment exchange areas in Scotland and in 10 out of 41 in the North-east coast the average rate of unemployment during 1936 was less than  that figure.    There are many areas outside the present schedule of Special Areas in whichthe unemployment recorded  exceeds -that  given  above for a large  proportion ofthe present Special Areas.  If follows, therefore, from the analysis given that these areas  will be in a position to prefer a strong claim for inclusion or alternativelythat there are grounds for the removal of some  of the areas classified as SpecialAreas from the existing schedule.    The rates of unemployment given above are to be compared with the corre-sponding average rate of unemployment in Great Britain as a whole of 18-7 percent, during the past 5 years  and of 13-9 per cent, during 1936, respectively.  Theabove analysis has not  been extended to the rate  of unemployment recorded atDecember, 1936, since that figure taken alone reflects seasonal influences and maybe misleading as an index of  general industrial conditions.    4. The claims of the areas in which the rates of unemployment are such as topresent  a prima facie case  for classification as Special Areas  are examined below,the areas being differentiated according as they are recommended for inclusion inthe Bill or  not.Areas recommended for inclusion in the Bill    (a)  The Coal Mining Area of South Lancashire. This area stretches roughlyfrom Blackrod in the North to St. Helens in the South, and from Westhoughtonin the East to Skelmersdale in the West.  It resembles the existing Special Areasin so far as it is dependent upon  a declining industry,  but is more fortunate than other distressed coal mining regions, since its towns and villages are situated withindaily travelling  distances of more prosperous and fortunate places ;  in spite ofthis, unemployment in certain parts of the coalfield has been persistent and severe.The following  table indicates the industrial  condition in the past and at present.Employment Exchange Area.	Insured Population (16-64 years).	Average Unemployment over the past 5 years.	Average Unemployment during 1936.	Rate of Unemployment at December, 1936.		Per cent.	Per cent.

Owing to this and toits dependence upon the coal industry, the area clearly compares with the SpecialAreas at present scheduled, and it is  recommended that it  should be brought within the Act, but so  as to exclude  the districts covered  by the  Ashton-inMakerfield, Leigh,  and St.  Helens Employment Exchanges.  In order to preserve the homogeneous character of the area,  it is recommended that Upholland should
be included with the rest of the area and that the following local authority areas should accordingly be incorporated in the schedule of the amending Bill:                    Abram Urban District.                   Aspull Urban District.                   Blackrod Urban District.                   Hindley Urban District.                   Ince-in-Makerfield Urban District.                   Orrell Urban District.                   Standish with  Langtree Urban District.                   Upholland Urban District.                   Westhoughton Urban District.                   Wigan County Borough.                   Wigan Rural District.    The inclusion of Abram, Aspull and Blackrod Urban Districts is recommendedas unemployed men in  these areas normally register at Hindley or Wigan ;  thearea of Billinge and Winstanley Urban  District is not recommended for inclusionas unemployed men in that area are normally included in the Ashton-in-Makerfielddistrict where the rate  of unemployment is relatively low.    (b) The Weaving^ District of N.E. Lancashire.-The  district comprised within this description consists of three parts :  the Blackburn sub-area, including Black-burn, Accrington,  Darwen, Great  Harwood and Clitheroe ; the Burnley sub-areacomprising Burnley, Nelson, Colne and Padiham ;  and  the Rossendale sub-area,comprising Bacup, Haslingden and Rawtenstall.   The past and present unemploy-ment position in these three sub-areas is shown in the table below  -				Employment Exchange Area.	Insured Population (16-64 years).

In view of the improvement in theemployment  position, neither the Burnley nor Rossendale  sub-areas present astrong case for inclusion in the amending Bill;  on the other hand, employmentin the Blackburn sub-area in spite of some improvement is still deficient and the relatively  high rate of unemployment  which still persists  justifies the extensionof the Act to at least part of that sub-area.  The following local authority areas would appear without doubt to be proper for inclusion :                    Blackburn County Borough.                   Darwen Municipal Borough.                   Great Harwood Urban District.                   Rishton Urban District.    The question arises whether the contiguous area of Blackburn Rural Districtshould  also  be included,  This area covers a very  wide  district which  includes
a number of rural parishes as well as some parishes which contain cotton  mills.It is considered that the inclusion of this area would involve drawing the line toowidely and though claims for the inclusion of Blackburn Rural District as a wholemay be pressed and may require to be further considered it is recommended that only that part of this area should be included which lies  between Darwen urban district and Oswaldtwistle Urban District.  j  In this connection reference should also be made to  the claims for  inclusionof Withnell Urban District, which abuts on Blackburn  Rural District and lieshalf  way between Blackburn and Chorley towards the South.  No separate  uh-employment rate is recorded for Withnell but it is estimated that the percentageof unemployment in the district  at December, 1936, is about 19 per cent.  Withnellwith an insured population of about 1,000 has on occasion been  the subject of representation for inclusion  as a Special Area, but it is felt that the rate of unemploy-ment stated above together with the risk which it would involve of extension tocontiguous areas does not justify the inclusion of the area in the Amending Bill.Moreover, Withnell is likely to benefit  from the  establishment of the new fillingfactory at Chorley.    Some doubt arises whether  the Accrington District should be included in theBlackburn group referred to above.  The local authority areas concerned  are :                      Accrington Municipal Borough ;                     Church Urban District;                     Clayton-le-Moors Urban District ;                     Oswaldtwistle Urban District.The  district covered by these authorities adjoins the  Blackburn Great Harwoodarea and is very similar in industrial character.  The rate of unemployment inAccrington at December, 1936, is well below that of Blackburn, Darwen and GreatHarwood, and its inclusion is likely to raise immediately  the question whetherBurnley ought not  to be included.   Burnley has a higher unemployment rate atDecember, 1936, than Accrington and like Blackburn is a close neighbour to it.  Theinclusion of the Accrington district comprising the four local authority areas referredto above will undoubtedly raise claims for the inclusion of other places like Burnleyand Padiham where recorded unemployment is higher but where the unemploymentrate  is not sufficiently high as to justify the inclusion of the area by itself. On theother hand, the  industrial similarity  of Accrington and Blackburn,  their close proximity and the fact that together they form a compact and homogeneous area would provide a  justification for inclusion of the area.   The question of the in-clusion of the Accrington district is submitted for decision, but it is recommended,for the reasons last mentioned, and in spite of the difficulties that may ensue, thatit would be preferable to include it with the Blackburn district.    Another district near  Blackburn  is Clitheroe;  the local  authority  areas concerned are Clitheroe Municipal  Borough and Clitheroe Rural District.   Theunemployment rate in Clitheroe  is lower  still  than in Accrington and  these local  authority areas are accordingly not recommended for  inclusion.     (c)  The Forest of Dean. This coalfield has in  the past  suffered severe and continued  unemployment  and   the  towns  affected,  Cinderford, Coleford andNewnham, have all had high rates of  unemployment, though there is  evidencethat employment has improved to a considerable extent at Coleford.  Lydneyhas not shared in the depression to the same extent  as  the other towns and atDecember,  1936,  the employment position  recorded  at Lydney  and at Colefordwas relatively favourable.   The relevant figures for this area are given below : 	Insured	Average	Average	Rate ofEmployment Exchange	Population	Unemployment	Unemployment	UnemploymentArea.

    It must be admitted that on the basis of the figure recorded during 1936 andat December,  1936, neither Coleford nor Lydney qualify for inclusion in the Billby themselves, and if they are included their presence in the list will, no  doubt,give rise to comparisons with other areas which have  failed to obtain inclusion.On the other  hand, employment is still deficient at Cinderford and in the smalldistrict of Newnham.   On  the basis of  these figures, the local authority ares which undoubtedly qualify for inclusion in the amending Bill are the East DeanRural District (Cinderford) and the parish of Newnham.   In view,  however, ofthe comparative remoteness of the area, of its compactness and the advisability of treating the coalfield as a whole, and of the relatively high level of unemploymentin the area as a whole, as set out above, it is recommended that the local authorityareas covering the whole coalfield and specified below, should  be included in theschedule of the amending Bill:                                                            - . -                       East Dean Rural District.                       Lydney Rural District.                       Newnham (Parish of).                       West Dean Rural District.Areas in which a prima facie case for inclusion exists but which are not recommended  as areas to be scheduled in the Bill.    5. There are a considerable number of areas scattered throughout the countryin which the unemployment figures are as high, if not higher, than  those which apply in the areas analysed above, as well as in the Special  Areas at presentscheduled.   An  analysis is  given below of the employment  position in a largenumber of these districts and reasons are given for their non-inclusion in theschedule of the amending Bill.     (a) North Staffordshire Coalfield. One small part of the  North StaffordshireCoalfield which has suffered  a  severe recession  in  employment,  and  in whichunemployment has been at  a  high  level for a  prolonged period, is that series ofcontiguous areas centred round  Audley,  Biddulph and  Kidsgrove.   The figuresof unemployment for this area are as follows : Employment Exchange Area.	Insured Population (16-64 years).	Average Unemployment over the past 5 years.	Average Unemployment during 1936.	Rate of Unemployment at December, 1936.		Per cent.	Per cent.	Per cent.Audley	1,740	37-2	27-8	27-6Biddulph	3,330	35-1	28-9	31-3Kidsgrove	3,320	56-7	50-1	49-9It will be observed that the rates of unemployment in this small area are evenmore strikingly high than in the Wigan or Forest of Dean coalfields and on grounds of equity the  area presents a case for inclusion as  strong, if not stronger, thanthese two areas.   The area is not, however,  recommended  for  inclusion  in  the amending Bill, since it is a small area and has not  the isolated  character of the forest of Dean  but stands in  the  midst of  an industrial area, contiguous tothe Potteries.   Moreover, it presents the difficulty involved in applying the Act to anumber of small districts scattered over the country and its inclusion might giverise to a claim that the provisions of the Act should be extended to the Potterydistrict itself.     (b) South-East Lancashire, Cheshire and North Derbyshire. One small group of towns in this area in which unemployment has persisted at a. relatively high level for a long time and in respect of which claims for inclusion have been made,consists of Mossley, Stalybridge, Glossop and Hadfield.   The first three  towns are mainly dependent upon cotton, textile bleaching, etc. ;   while Hadfield  (and to a
smaller extent Glossop) are also dependent on the paper and paper board industries.The past and present figures of unemployment in these areas are as follows : Employment Exchange Area.	Insured Population (16-64 years).	Average Unemployment over the past 5 years.	Average Unemployment during 1936.	Rate of Unemployment at December, 1936.Mossley Stalybridge Glossop Hadfield......	4,100 11,080 6,240 2,880	Per cent. 33-2 30-6 27-0 45-2	Per cent. 22-6 21-5 21-3 43-3	Per cent. 17-8 20-0 19-2 40-2    There has been a considerable improvement in  the  employment position inMossley, Stalybridge and  Glossop, and the  December,  1936,  figures present a relatively weak case for the inclusion of these areas in the Schedule ;  the Hadfieldarea, however, shows little or no improvement, but it would scarcely be possibleto treat that area apart from the others.  Moreover, the whole area is in such close proximity to Manchester and the more prosperous areas of South Lancashire thatopportunities for development and for employment are not altogether lacking.  Inthese circumstances it is recommended that the area should not be  included.    (c) Liverpool Area. A claim for inclusion in the Special Areas  has also beenpreferred by the City of Liverpool.  About one-half of the working activity of this area is concerned with the shipping and handling of goods, and behind the vastorganisation engaged in processes of distribution, there are to be found only thegeneral services of State, municipality and private enterprise supplying the needsof the  local population,  building and other trades required for local needs,  andinnumerable &quot; port  &quot; industries dealing with heavy raw materials, e.g., flour milling,oil, soap, oil cake and cattle food, sugar refining, not individually large but widelyvarying in kind.   With an  industrial  organisation dependent on  general tradeprosperity, unemployment has been prolonged and  is still on a relatively high level.   The relevant figures are as follows : Employment Exchange Area.	Insured Population (16-64 years).	Average Unemployment over the past 5 years.	Average Unemployment during 1936.	Rate of Unemployment at December, 1936.		Per cent.	Per cent.

The problem presented by an  area such as the  City of Liverpooldiffers, however, fundamentally from that presented by the hard hit  cotton and coal areas.  The port of Liverpool is not  mainly dependent on a single depressedindustry;  indeed, as shown above, it ha.s a great variety of industries, all of whichare not necessarily depressed at the same time.  So far as economic development isconcerned, it has itself sufficient attraction to  new industrial enterprises as not torequire Government assistance in breaking new ground, while as regards measures for social improvement its own resources are sufficiently great not to need Govern-ment help for the purpose of carrying  on its public services.  Moreover, the industrialdepression which has existed in the past is bound  to respond to the general traderevival and its prospects for the future are in a far different case from those of the scheduled special areas or the depressed Wigan and Blackburn districts.  For these and other reasons it is recommended that there  should be no extension of theAct to cover the Liverpool Area.
    (d)  The Yorkshire Coalfield. Claims for inclusion in the Special Areas have beenpreferred by districts such as Barnsley,  Conisborough,  Hoyland, and Pontefract.In considering the case of these places for inclusion it would, however, be impossibleto separate them from other hard-hit areas in the same coalfields, and in practice itwould be necessary to consider the area enclosed by a line drawn from Barnsley Castleford- Goole-Conisborough Barnsley.  The rates  of  unemployment, past and present,.in the  more hardly-hit towns in this area are set out below : Employment Exchange Area.	Insured Population (16-64 years).

Kirkby	9,140	32-9	20-4	14-8Thorne	7,210	26-1	31-6	24-3Unemployment in many of the towns in this area, and notably in Askern, Barnsley,Goole, Hoyland, Knottingley and Thorne is on  a level comparable with that  ofother areas which it is proposed to include or are already included in the SpecialAreas.  The average rate of unemployment during 1936 remained throughout at ahigh level;  the December  1936 figures reflect  the seasonal activity  in  the coalindustry and are not necessarily a reliable index of the industrial condition of the area.Some difficulty has, however, been felt in recommending the inclusion of an area  sowide in extent as this in the amending Bill in view of its effect  in dispersing theassistance that could be given under the Act.   Moreover, large  parts of  the area are, by reason of their proximity to the busier industrial areas in Mid and SouthYorkshire, and in particular to Leeds and Sheffield, in a position to profit by theincreased activity of these contiguous areas,  and in these circumstances it is con-sidered that the area should not be brought within the provisions of the Act.   . [e) Yorkshire Hull. The  claim of Hull  for inclusion  must  be dealt with separately, as it cannot properly  be linked up with any of the foregoing areas.With an insured population of 92,820, its average rate of unemployment has been :during the past five years 19-0 per cent, and during the year 1936 16-3 percent. ;at December,  1936, the rate recorded was 15-0 per cent.   These rates of unem-ployment  are relatively low as compared with other areas asking for inclusion, and he average of 16-3 per cent,  for 1936 is comparable with the corresponding figureof 13-9 per  cent, for  Great Britain as a whole.  In so far as the unemployment figures provide an index of industrial conditions, the position disclosed in Hullwould not justify the inclusion of  the area ;   and it would, in any event, be impracticable to segregate so small  an area as Hull and apply the Act to it,  withoutincluding  many areas  of  higher  unemployment,  remote  from  other  areas ofindustrial development, and with less  variety of industry on which to  depend.It is recommended, therefore, that the  claims of Hull for inclusion should not be conceded.    (/) Tees-side and the North Riding of Yorkshire. Another area of Yorkshire inrespect of which claims for inclusion in the Special Areas have been made consists of a number of towns on Tees-side and in the North Riding in which unemployment
has been rife  in  the past.  The  principal towns concerned  and the  rates  ofunemployment in them are given below : Employment Exchange Area.	Insured Population (16-64 years).

Sofar as the large centres are concerned, i.e., Middlesbrough and Stockton-on-Tees,there has been a very substantial improvement owing to the great activity in the steel industry, and this, together with the variety of their industries, renders it unnecessary, it is  considered, to bring them within  the  scope of the Act.  Thedecline in the iron ore industry and the concentration of steel production in other&apos;areas has presented  an intractable  problem of  unemployment at Guisborough,Saltburn and Stokesley, but to specify these areas alone, even if such a course were practicable,  would give  rise to claims  in respect of Middlesbrough and district, theinclusion of which would not be justified and would effect a further dispersal of effort.   In these circumstances  it is  recommended that the  area should not bescheduled in the Special Areas.    (g) Cornwall and  Devon. -Areas in these counties which have preferred claims to be scheduled as Special Areas include Camborne, Redruth, Bideford, etc.    The areas of relatively high unemployment and their industrial condition aregiven in the table below : 4 Employment Exchange Area.

It  is difficult to find  any unifyingprinciple which would justify the collection of these heterogeneous towns into one area, short of making the whole counties of Devon and Cornwall Special Areas, andfor this reason, together with the dispersal of resources which would be involved and the  administrative difficulties in administering such a scattered area, theinclusion of these districts in the Bill is not recommended.
    (h) Wales. The areas in respect of which claims for inclusion have been madeinclude Anglesey, Carmarthen and the large towns of Cardiff, Swansea, Neath andNewport, together with the  rural districts of  Glamorganshire which abut  on theSouth  Wales Special Areas,  but  are not at present included.   From the point ofview of heavy unemployment it is also necessary to consider some of the coal areasin North Wales.  The unemployment position in the more rural areas affected bythese claims is set out in the  table below : Employment Exchange Area.	Insured Population (16-64 years).

Exchange Areas of Anglesey andDenbighshire, with the exception of Cefn Mawr, unemployment has ranged, andcontinues to remain, at a  high level.  As compared with other areas, Anglesey andDenbigh have a strong case for inclusion in the list of Special Areas, but, in viewof the geographical distribution of the unemployment in them, it would be necessaryto apply the Act to the whole of the counties concerned.  The application  of theAct to areas so wide in  extent and so scattered as these  would involve a veryconsiderable extension in  the Commissioners&apos; powers, and cause a further dispersal of the resources at his command.    Claims for inclusion have also been made by Carmarthenshire, the rural districts of Glamorgan not at present  included, and in particular by  Pontardawe.  Theunemployment position in these areas is shown in the table below : 	Insured	Average	Average	Rate ofEmployment Exchange	Population	Unemployment	Unemployment	UnemploymentArea.

    In the case of Carmarthenshire, the main claim for inclusion is made in respectof the Eastern Part of the county.   This area was not previously included as aSpecial Area, because of the comparative prosperity of the anthracite coalfield, butunemployment at places such as Burry Port, Kidwelly, Garnant and Llandilo hasranged for a long time  at  a very high level.  In spite of  the  relatively betteremployment  position disclosed  at Ammanford and Llanelly, these districts of east  Carmarthenshire,  together with  that  part  of Glamorgan not  at  presentscheduled as. a Special Area, present a very strong case for inclusion as Special Areas.In view of the further dissipation of effort which would result from an extension to areas  so large in extent, these districts have not at  present been included in the listof recommended areas, but if it is decided to concede the claims of these areas, theLocal Authority districts to be  brought within the scope of the Act would appearto be  as follows :                    Rest of Glamorgan.        Eastern Carmarthenshire.                 Swansea R.D.          Llanelly M.B.                 Gower R.D.            Kidwelly M.B.                 Pontardawe R.D.

(S. of River Towy).                                        Llanelly R.D.    The unemployment in the large towns of Glamorgan at present excluded fromthe Schedule is as follows : Employment Exchange Area.	Insured Population (16-64 years).	Average Unemployment over the past 5 years.	Average Unemployment during 1936.	Rate of Unemployment at December, 1936.		Per cent.	Per cent.

For these reasons,  together with thefurther  dispersal  of effort which the inclusion of  these towns would involve, it isconsidered  that there  is no need to bring these towns within the scope of the Act.    (i) Scotland. Claims for inclusion in the Special Areas come from the highlands and Islands,  the  Moray Firth, Glasgow, the northern part  of West Lothian andLeith.                                            ...  c  Reference has already been made to the relatively lower rate of unemploymentthat obtains  in the Scottish  Special Area as compared with the Special Areas inEngland and Wales.  The employment position  in the several  areas in Scotlandthat now claim to be classified as Special Areas  is examined in detail below.  Itwill be  seen  that those of the areas which, in fact, are suffering from prolonged and  severe unemployment present in general  special  problems which cannotadequately be dealt  with through the provisions of  the  Special Areas  Act.As  regards the  remaining areas,  the  general  level of  recorded  unemployment is not itself of such an order  as specially to justify their inclusion within the Act.After a careful examination  of all the relevant factors, it is considered that thebalance of  advantage lies in  making no further extension of the Special Areas inScotland and it is recommended accordingly.    (i) The Highlands and Islands.-. The problem presented by the Highlands and islands  is not one  which is  susceptible  to  treatment  by the application of the remedies provided by the  Special Areas Act, and it is considered that the requiredassistance to these - areas would be better given by measures  directed to  their particular difficulties than by bringing them within  the provisions of the SpecialAreas Act.
    (ii) The Moray Firth Area. Unemployment in the Moray Firth area, which is mainly dependent on the fishing and fish curing industry, has been and remains,severe.  The relevant figures relating to the towns affected are set out below : Employment Exchange Area.	Insured Population (16-64 years).

It is undoubtedlytrue  that  unemployment  is severe throughout  the  area but it  is felt  that  theapplication of the Act to a narrow belt extending  along the  coast line of over200 miles would  be scarcely practicable, and that  the  special problems of this area,  like  those of the Highlands  and Islands, would be better dealt  with by measures appropriate to the peculiar circumstances of the area than by bringingit within the provisions of the Special Areas Act, whose main object is to segregatea small number of heavily depressed areas and to afford them the greatest assistancepossible.   In  these circumstances it is  recommended that the Moray Firth ports should not be brought within the ambit of the Act.    (iii) West  Lothian. A claim has recently been  preferred that  the  northern part of this County which is now excluded from the Special Areas, should be brought within the scope of the Act.  The present boundary is at present drawn south ofthe railway line between Castlecary and Linlithgow.  The Employment Exchangeareas  comprised within this district consists of Bo&apos;ness,  Linlithgow  and SouthQueensferry.   The relevant information as to the unemployment  position is asfollows : Employment Exchange Area.	Insured Population (16-64 years).	Average Unemployment over the past 5 years.	Average Unemployment during 1936.	Rate of Unemployment at December, 1936.		Per cent.	Per cent.	Per cent.Bo&apos;ness	4,430	25-3	19-8	14-6Linlithgow	2,110	27-9	23-0	21-south Queensferry	780	34-5	27-5	25-8
    It will be observed from the above  figures that there has been considerable improvement in the employment position at Bo&apos;ness.  The rate of unemployment at Linlithgow is  moderately high,  while in the  small&quot; industrial area of SouthQueensferry it is still severe.    There is no great industrial development in that part of West Lothian north of the railway and there would be no insuperable  difficulty in including the wholeCounty, except for the fact that the extension would be likely to bring in a demandfor  the inclusion  of the Northern part of Midlothian which it would  be difficultto resist.  On the whole it is considered that the advantage lies in  pursuing-a consistent policy of providing no further extension of the Special Areas in Scotland,and that the claim for the extension in this County should not be conceded.    (iv) Leith (Midlothian). A claim has  recently been made  that Leith bescheduled as a special area &quot; for the purposes of a grant to create schemes of workfor  absorbing the unemployed.&quot;  The unemployment position in  the  area of theLeith employment area is as set out below : 	Insured	Average	Average	Rate ofEmployment Exchange	Population	Unemployment	Unemployment	UnemploymentArea.

Per cent.Leith	25,660	24-6	21-7	18-6    These figures of unemployment are rather below the level  recorded  in theareas of West Lothian which are not recommended for inclusion ;  moreover thedistrict  is contiguous to Edinburgh in which the average rate of unemploymentduring 1936 was only  14-1  per cent, and the  rate recorded at December, 1936,was  13-7 per cent.   In view of the fact that Leith could only be brought in by extending the special areas to the Northern part of West Lothian and Midlothianand its proximity to Edinburgh, this area has not been recommended for inclusion.     (v) Other Areas in Scotland. The claims of other areas in Scotland in whichthere has been a high level ef unemployment are examined below. In this connection it  is to be observed that the City Council  of  Glasgow has recently  renewed itsclaim to be brought  within the provisions of the Act ;  it has- also been  suggestedby the Scottish Office  that the Jute and Linen districts in the County of Angusshould be considered  for inclusion.  The unemployment position in  the areas concerned is  as follows :-. Employment Exchange Area.	Insured Population (16-64 years).	Average Unemployment over the past 5 years.

    Dealing first with the Jute and Linen districts of Angus it will be apparentfrom the average rate of unemployment during 1936 that except for Montrose and,to a lesser degree, Dundee; the unemployment recorded does not, in comparisonwith many other areas similarly affected, call for  any  special measures.  In thecase of Dundee, the dependence of the area on work  primarily performed by womenhas for  a very long time created a problem of unemployment among men, but itmay be observed that the shipbuilding industry in the City is showing increasedactivity, and prospects of increased employment are on the whole better than theyhave been for some time.    In  Montrose about 16 per cent, of the insured population is engaged in theLinen industry, 7 per cent, in Food, and 19 per cent, in the Distributive  industries.In view of the need for homogeneous areas, it would be inadvisable to apply theAct to the relatively small areas covered by Dundee City Council or Montrose Burgh,and the employment position in the County of Angus as a whole would not appearto justify the inclusion of so wide an area.    Attention has also been drawn to the industrial condition of the small village ofWanlockhead, in Dumfriesshire.  The employment exchange  area  which servesWanlockhead (as well as the village of Leadhills) is  centred at Sanquhar, to whichthe unemployment  figures given above relate.  These figures  are relatively low,but do not necessarily reflect the position at Wanlockhead itself,  and,  except fordifficulties which might be created elsewhere by granting an extension of the SpecialAreas in Scotland,  there  would be no great objection to the inclusion of theappropriate parish, so as to bring Wanlockhead within the scope of the Act.    As regards the  Claims of Glasgow, it will be observed that the unemploymentposition is more favourable than that recorded at Liverpool, Cardiff, Swansea, etc.,but approximates to that at Middlesbrough.  All the considerations enumeratedabove in the case of Liverpool apply with added force to the City of Glasgow, since it possesses a much greater variety of industries than Liverpool and the improvementin the shipbuilding  industry is  likely to bring much greater relief, absolutely and relatively, to it.   Moreover, it is likely, in view of its engineering and shipbuildingresources, to share to a far greater extent in the rearmament programme.   It wouldbe impracticable to bring in Glasgow without including  the other large  cities withcomparable degrees of unemployment, and it is recommended that  it should notbe included in the list of Special Areas.    Lennoxtown is a small village claiming inclusion  as a Special Area on the ground of industrial depression.   Its labour requirements are dealt with by the employment exchange at Kirkintilloch, which is itself scheduled  as a Special Area.  The rate ofunemployment in the Kirkintilloch  area is, as shown above, relatively low, but it covers a wide district and does not, therefore, reflect the depressed conditions in the village of Lennoxtown, which have arisen through the closing of the only bleachingand printing works.  The  Lennoxtown area is small, but has certain affinities withKirkintilloch, and if it is agreed that some extensions are to be permitted in Scotland,there could be no substantial objection to the inclusion of the appropriate parishin-the County of Stirling.The exclusion of Areas at present in the Schedule of Special Areas.    6. It is recommended in the Report (paragraph 22) that a less restrictive testmust  be  applied for the  purpose of removing areas from the present Schedule ofSpecial Areas, than for including new areas, and that power should accordingly betaken to exclude only those areas in which such a measure of industrial recoveryhas been achieved as to render application of the Act to the area no longer necessary.It is also recommended that it might be desirable to exclude  certain areas at presentscheduled in which conditions have already been reached which would qualify themfor  exclusion under the  above test.   The areas which  come within the field forconsideration for exclusion on this basis are :       (a) That part of Northumberland at present scheduled ; and      (&amp;) certain parts of Scotland.    (a)  Northumberland. Reference has been made to  the fact  that the SpecialCommissioner for England and Wales has not felt justified  in applying his powersto the Newcastle area in view of its  relatively prosperous  condition and that  he
would not  accordingly be adverse to, a proposal to remove from the Schedule ofSpecial Areas, that part of Northumberland which is at present within the Act.In this connection, however, it is desirable  to set out what the unemploymentposition is in the areas affected.Employment Exchange Area.	Insured - Population (16-64 years).	Average Unemployment over the past 5 years.	Average Unemployment during 1936.	Rate of Unemployment at December, 1936.		Per cent;	Per cent.

If the proposal toremove the whole of the  area north of the River Tyne were adopted, the localauthority areas to be excluded would be the County Borough of Newcastle-upon-&apos;Tyne, the County Borough of Tynemouth, the Borough of Wallsend and the urban district of Longbenton and Newburn.  If, however, it is deemed desirable to retain the areas of heavy unemployment north of the Tyne, the  areas to be excludedwould  be the County Borough of Newcastle-upon-Tyne and the Urban Districts ofNewburn and Longbenton.  The grounds on which the exclusion might be justifiedare that the Commissioner has not been able to exercise his full powers in the area and that with the improvement in the  shipbuilding industry, employment in  thearea should substantially improve  during  the next six months.  On the  otherhand, it would perhaps be difficult, in the present state of Parliamentary opinion,to exclude any part of the existing Special  Area, particularly when high rates ofunemployment are still being recorded in a substantial part  of the area.    (b) Scotland. There are considerable areas in Scotland in which the unemploy-ment position is certainly no worse than that recorded in the  Newcastle-upon-Tynearea and which,  if similar  tests  were applied, would come within the field  forconsideration with a view to exclusion.   The relatively favourable position of  theSpecial Areas  in  Scotland, to which reference has  been already  made  above, is,however, complicated by  the fact  that even in counties where a large  number ofdistricts are  in a  relatively favourable  position,  there are  &quot; pockets &quot;  where unemployment continues at  a high level.  A general conspectus of the  unemploy-ment  position in the Scottish Special Areas is given in the statement attached here to.    On. the basis of these  figures (and assuming that exclusion of existing areas ispossible) the areas affected would be as  follows :           (a) The County of Ayr. The local authority areas covering the employ-       ment exchange areas  of Kilmarnock, Newmilns, Stevenston and Stewarton,       would qualify for exclusion.          (b)  The County of Dumbarton. The local authority areas covering  the.       employment  exchange areas of Clydebank  and Helensburgh  would qualify       for exclusion,  but it would be difficult to segregate Clydebank from the rest       of the county.  The  proposal to exclude the extra landward part of  the       County, i.e., the  rural parishes of  Arrochar, Rhu, Roseneath, etc.,  would       be of no effect since, in fact, the Commissioner does not exercise  his powers       in these districts, but if any exclusions are to be made, they should be       confined to these parishes.          (c)  The County of Lanark. The  only  areas which would require con-       sideration for exclusion would be Lanark, Rutherglen and Shotts.  The effect       of exclusion would  be merely to create small  &quot; islands &quot; in the midst of  the       county, where the powers of the Act  would not  &quot; run,&quot; and it is suggested       that the better solution would be to  leave the areas  as defined  at present       and to leave the question of exercising his powers in these more prosperous       towns to the discretion of the Commissioner.(C 24100)
     (d) The County of.Renfrew.---The only areas in the county in which theexisting unemployment, renders the continuance  of the  Act. essential areGreenock  and Port Glasgow.  Elsewhere unemployment  is on a relatively low level and is likely to become even less in the near future.     (e)  West Lothian and Mid Lothian.-On the basis of the recorded figuresthe Bathgate and West Calder areas would qualify for exclusion but it wouldbe difficult to separate these areas from the rest of the scheduled areas.Statement showing the Unemployment Position in the Special Areas                     at present Scheduled.Special Area.

                               APPENDIX III                ALTERATIONS  IN  THE SPECIAL  AREAS                       SCOTTISH  OFFICE RESERVATION    1. The representatives of the Scottish Office on the Committee do not considerthat the  &quot; Second Possibility &quot; which if any  extensions are  to be   made  theCommittee place  first  in their order  of  preference  (with the correspondingAppendix I) would be satisfactory at  any rate in relation to  Scotland.   whatever may be said  for or against the  adoption of that course for  the Special Areas inEngland and  Wales  its application to Scotland would produce a position verydifficult to defend.    2. The unemployment situation  in  Scotland  is still bad although recovery in iron, steel, shipbuilding, and engineering  has caused some improvement in theWest  of Scotland.   On the  whole unemployment is much  heavier in Scotlandthan in England and extends over a larger  part of the country.    The  Unempioy-ment  Index (November, 1936) for Scotland is  19-1  as  compared with 12-9 forGreat  Britain.   The  figures  for Ross and  Cromarty (51-2) and Caithness andSutherland (37-9) are higher than those for Glamorganshire (31-3).    3. If the Special Areas were stereotyped on the  restricted  basis proposed inthis  &quot; Possibility,&quot; areas in which  the existing severe  unemployment becomesworse would be permanently shut out unless fresh legislation (involving renewedcontroversies)  were introduced.   The  changes  which have  occurred  during  thepast two years illustrate the disadvantages of such an inflexible system.    4. A more suitable method appears to be to avoid stereotyping the additionalareas  and to give the Commissioner discretion to exercise his powers  in areas of high unemployment to be fixed from time to time by the Minister concernedacting with the advice of an informal Committee.    5. If, however, it should be  decided as a question of  policy to  adopt  the&quot; Second Possibility &quot; the Scottish Office suggest that the scheduled areas shouldbe readjusted in accordance  with the  attached schedule.  This  readjustment hasbeen prepared after discussion with the Commissioner who attaches importance tohaving reasonably  homogeneous and well-defined areas  so as to avoid practicaldifficulties in administration which arise from the undue dissection of counties.A number of the areas omitted (e.g., the Burghs of Lanark and Biggar in the firstitem)  form pockets in  an otherwise  homogeneous area and, for administrativepurposes, it  might be  more convenient  to leave  them in  and to rely  on  the discretion which the Commissioner has  exercised in the past  to exclude such places from assistance.  -    6. The additions proposed in Scotland (if the method of a stereotyped scheduleis adopted) are  (1) Glasgow, (2) the Moray Firth coastal district,  (3)  the  part ofWestlothian north of the railway line  which is at present excluded, (4)  small areasin Stirlingshire, including Lennoxtown, (5) a small area in Dumfriesshire includingthe lead mining village of Wanlockhead.    The exclusion of these areas  is difficult to justify  either upon the principle which is adopted in Appendix I of &quot; pursuing a consistent policy of providing nofurther extension  of  the Special Areas in Scotland &quot; or upon any other  general grounds.    The proposed  additions  (3), (4), and (5) are small areas on  the fringe of thepresent Areas in which depression exists in different  forms of mining  or in calicoprinting.    7. Glasgow has heavy and  prolonged unemployment which persists in spiteof increased activity in shipbuilding, etc.   Both geographically and economicallyit is the centre of the existing Special Areas.   Its economic  interdependence with
 them was emphasised in the Final Report of Sir Arthur Rose who referred to the &quot; somewhat artificial nature &quot;of the Scheduled Areas.  The same point is brought out by the recent Report of the Departmental Committee on Gas Supplies in the West of Scotland which finds that modernisation of coke  ovens and iron&apos; works is essential to the existence of the pig iron industry in Scotland and that the proposal to  establish modern ovens in Lanarkshire is dependent on purchase of  the oven gas by the Corporation of Glasgow.  In these circumstances not only the Commis- sioner but other bodies, e.g., the Nuffield Trust may be debarred from operations beneficial to the existing Special Areas if Glasgow is  excluded.  Glasgow is an integral part  of  the West  of Scotland industrial  district in a way  to which the relation of Liverpool to Lancashire offers no parallel.     8. The  Moray Firth coastal district is suffering from severe and prolonged unemployment owing to depression in the Herring  Industry.  The assistance rendered by the  Government to that industry by the Herring Indiustry Act has produced a little improvement. But the economic condition of the distruct remains very bad.  Indeed a contraction of  the herring industry was contemplated by the; Act itself.                            .  -     9. The establishment of other  industries (such as exist in one or two of the herring ports) would be of great value as an auxiliary support to these communities. Measures taken by the Commissioner  or the Nufheld Trust might  contribute to that end or even to developments in the fishing industry itself.     10. The proposed additions do  not include the Highlands and Islands.  Most of  the Highland  Counties have a very high Unemployment Index.  They might, however, be left out of the Schedule on the ground that the Commissioner^ machinery is not  suitable for dealing with them and that a Committee set up by the Scottish Economic Committee in consultation with the Secretary of  State  is at  present considering the question of their economic development.  But it would probably be  necessary to give an assurance that  the question of dealing with these areas by other  methods will be  sympathetically considered by the  Government  when the Report of the Committee has been  received and examined.

APPENDIX D7ASSISTANCE  TO  LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN THE SPECIAL  AREAS                          REPORT OF SUB-COMMITTEE                             England  and  Wales    The term &quot; Special Areas &quot; as used in this memorandum means the areas sodescribed in the Special Areas (Development and Improvement) Act, 1934.  TheSpecial Areas comprise :          Counties (parts of)              Durham.             Northumberland.             Cumberland.             Monmouth.             Glamorgan.             Brecknock.             Pembroke.    Other expressions are also in use to describe areas  with high rates and severeunemployment.    Thus on the occasion  of the special grants made [a) in 1930-31 and (b) in1933-34,  the  terms  &quot; necessitous areas &quot; and &quot; distressed areas &quot; were  usedrespectively.    &quot; Necessitous areas &quot; covered practically the same area  as the  Special areas with the addition of parts of the Counties of Carmarthen and Stafford.    &quot; Distressed areas &quot; covered a wider area and included three counties (Norfolk,Anglesey, and Carmarthen) and twelve County Boroughs (e.g., Liverpool,  Norwich,West  Ham) which are not included in  the  Special Areas.  It did not cover the counties of Northumberland and Brecknock and the County Boroughs  of SouthShields, Tynemouth and West  Hartlepool, which are included in the Special Areas.    In addition, the expression &quot; depressed areas,&quot; though not statutory, is used by  the  Ministry of Labour to denote those areas to which the  facilities of theindustrial transference scheme apply,  and which enjoy a preference, other thingsbeing equal, in the allocation of Government contracts.  It covers, in addition tothe Special  Areas,  all areas  which satisfy certain  conditions  as to the  rate ofunemployment.    1. The problem of the Special Areas falls into two main parts (1) the  economic problem the question of relieving unemployment  by reviving existing industries and introducing new ones, together with such palliatives as land settlement, publicworks and transference ; (2) the Local  Government problem.  The latter is to alarge  extent a symptom of the former,  caused by the increasing poverty of theinhabitants.  This  poverty involves  both greater need for  social services,  inparticular for public assistance, and also diminishing resources, of which shrinkingrateable value is a sign.  Further in  at  least some parts  of the Special Areas theeconomic conditions in themselves restrict the electors&apos;  field of choice and lead toa type of local government administration which fails to command public confidence.    2. There are two connecting links between  the  economic  and the LocalGovernment  problem.   High  rates  and, in  certain areas, the  suspicion  ofextravagance,  maladministration and  even corruption  are both alleged to act asdeterrents to the introduction  of new or rehabilitation of existing industries inthe Areas.  It is with the second problem, that of Local Government  in the SpecialAreas, with which the present  memorandum is concerned.County Boroughs     Gateshead.    Newcastle-on-Tyne.    South Shields.    Sunderland.    Tynemouth.    West Hartlepool.    Merthyr Tydfil.
    3. It is desirable first to examine  the  grounds for the  assumption that thefinance  of Local Government in the Special Areas  demands special measures ofassistance.  For this purpose material factors are            (1) The level of rates in these areas as compared             (a) with the average of the country,             (6) with their own level in preceding years,             (c) with other highly rated areas, not being Special Areas ;           (2) The total expenditure of  these areas expressed in terms of a rate in      the - , and the percentage thereof which is grant-borne ;           (3) The total expenditure of Focal Authorities in the Special Areas on      public assistance and other chief services.    4. Statistical information  on these points  is  given  in  Appendices  to  thismemorandum.  That information is presented with the necessary caveat that thelevel of  rate-poundage is  affected by the level of assessment,  and it must be borne in mind that uniformity of assessment particularly in the case of dwelling houses and shops is still far from being realised, even allowing for the large variations in actual rental value of comparable properties in different parts of the country.    And there are other reasons why such  factors as &quot; level of rates &quot; and also&quot; rateable value per head &quot; or &quot; rates raised per head,&quot; which are sometimes referredto must be used with caution in appraising the financial circumstances of a localgovernment area and the burden imposed on its ratepayers by its local services.Persons, it must be remembered, are rated not properties ;  and the true burdenof any given expenditure will vary with the financial capacity of the bulk of theinhabitants  whose  properties make up the aggregate rateable value of the area.    5. An examination of the  Appendices discloses  the following position :            Appendix A. The  general  level of rates in Administrative Counties      in the Special Areas is notably higher in Durham, Glamorgan, and Monmouth      than in other Counties.  In the remainder of the Counties included mainly      or partly in the Special  Areas, the level of rates, though above the  average      for the country (11s.  S\d.), is not much  higher than the level of rates in      other Counties, of which a selection is given in the Appendix, and indeed is      lower than in some of those.           Appendix  B. In  County  Boroughs   the  level  of  rates  is  only      extraordinarily high in one case, Merthyr Tydfil, as compared with the      average (13s. 6d.).           Appendix C. The  chief sources of expenditure which go to make up      these rates in Counties are shown in Appendix C.    The expenditure on public assistance throughout the Counties in the SpecialAreas is, with the same three exceptions,  not markedly greater than in  otherCounties.  Subject to special  circumstances affecting the expenditure of certainCounty  Districts under  particular heads,  the  same general consideration  holdsgood as regards the other services mentioned in the Appendices.           Appendix D. Here again the figures show  that, as regards the public       assistance rate, there is not, apart from Merthyr  Tydfil, a marked difference       between the rate level of County Boroughs in the Special Areas and that of       a number of other large industrial towns.  With the same exception, this       holds good of the  other services.     6.  The recent history of the question of additional financial assistance to theSpecial Areas should be recalled.  In earlier debates, Ministers have generally taken the line adopted in Lord Portals  Report  as investigator in South  Wales.  Thiswas that these areas would be helped considerably by the  assumption by theU.A.B. of responsibility  for most of the able-bodied unemployed ; that that eventwould be closely followed by the statutory review of the block grant due to take effect from  1st April, 1937 ; that on that review it would be possible to pay special regard  to the needs of hard-hit areas ; and that the  time to consider whether moreshould  be done was when it was seen  what was the measure of assistance whichcould be given in these ways.

The statistics to which attention is called in paragraph 6, coupled with theconsideration mentioned in paragraph 7, would seem to lead to the conclusion that,except perhaps in one or two areas, the burden of rates in the Special Areas, or theburden of the rate for public assistance in particular, is not so great, either as com-pared with certain other areas or as compared with past years in the Special Areasthemselves, as to justify any special measures&apos; of financial assistance beyond what may be expected to accrue from Block Grant revision.   It  should also be realised that if any further special assistance is now given to a wide range of areas, suchaction might jeopardise the current negotiations on  the block grant which  are proceeding on the basis that a substantial contribution to the needs of these areascan properly be found  by an adjustment in  their favour of the formula for  thedistribution of that grant.    8. On the other hand, it may be argued that economic distress in the SpecialAreas is of longer standing and the prospects of recovery infinitely more remote atany rate in some parts of them than in other areas which can point to high ratesin general and/or high rates for public assistance in particular.  Some  of  theSpecial Areas  (e.g., Merthyr) are bearing  the cost of expensive  capital works andhighly-developed services  incurred  at a time  when the expenditure was not dis-proportionate  to their needs and resources.  They can never hope to regain theirpast prosperity in full,  and perhaps are  unlikely to retain the population whichjustified  their past commitments.   Politically,  too, the concentration of  public attention on&apos; the Special Areas may necessitate action on the Local Governmentside as well as on the economic  side of the problem which, on a purely statisticalsurvey, might not seem to be wholly justifiable or logically capable of being confined to the Special Areas.    9. If these considerations are regarded as establishing a case for some assistancenotwithstanding the general arguments in paragraphs 6 and 7,  it would,  at most,appear that the case would rest on the exceptional position of one or two areaswithin the Special Areas.  It remains to consider what is the scope of any necessaryassistance, in what form or forms can it most  profitably be  given and what may itconnote in the shape of further control by the Central Government.    10. The case that is made for assistance is, broadly,  (a) that the burden of ratesimposed  by unescapable liabilities at the moment is too  great for the diminishedresources of the ratepayers in the areas ;  and (&amp;) that certain established services
are being in consequence starved, and the institution or desirable development ofother services is prevented.  These two aspects of the matter Call for separate consideration.  As regards (a), the demand which  has been  pressed  upon  theGovernment is in the main for some alleviation of the burden of public assistance.The various suggestions  that have been made,  and  pressed,  extend to such. expedients as            (i)  Removing the financial and administrative responsibility  for public       assistance, or of that part of. it which is out-relief, from Local Authorities to       a Central Authority ;           (ii) Such financial assistance as will reduce the cost of public assistance       to the average level of the country either by some scheme for the equalisation       of public  assistance  rates or by Exchequer subsidy.     11.  On the assumption, therefore,  that a case for some assistance  to certainLocal Authorities in the Special Areas could be established under this head it remains to consider what form it could best take.     The plan of widening  the powers of the Commissioner so as to  enable him todisburse Exchequer money at his discretion in relief of expenditure on  publicassistance appears open to strong objection.  The duty of the Commissioner isto  take, or to encourage, specific . measures for improving  the condition  of  theSpecial Areas.   To impose on him the further responsibility for determining whatamount  of Exchequer grant should be  made available for relieving rates and on what basis is should be distributed  amongst the various Authorities, would be to charge him with a duty which, it is suggested, is more appropriate to Parliamentitself or to the Government.  If, however, the range and amount of grant and thebasis of apportionment are laid down in the Bill or are left to a Minister of  theCrown, it would serve no useful  purpose that  the  money should pass throughthe Commissioners hands.     12.  Another possible course would be the immediate assumption by a CentralAuthority (presumably the Unemployment  Assistance Board) of financial andadministrative responsibility for public assistance in the Special Areas.   This seemsopen to serious objection  on more than one ground.  Administratively it wouldbe difficult to throw a mass of new work upon the Board before it has fully got into its stride and settled  the principles of its administration in the more limitedfield to  which it is at present confined.  The propriety, or  otherwise, of such a transfer is one that merits consideration  as a general issue and not as a special and localised  question, although, if a  clear decision had been reached to  effectsuch a transfer generally in the near future, there would be less objection to antici-pating the general change  in the case of the Special Areas.  Even so, the effective-ness of the financial relief that would be afforded  would depend on the extent ofthe transfer.  If it were confined  to the residue  of &quot; able-bodied,&quot; the relief tothe rates would be relatively small, as will be seen from the following figures :                                                                   Rate                                                              equivalent.                                                                   a.

Politically,  too, it would undoubtedly be subject to criticism  by those whodislike the Means Test, on the ground that the salving of the Special Areas is tobe achieved by  grinding the faces of the poor.
     13. A third  course, namely, the granting of financial assistance designed tobring the ratepayers&apos; share of the  cost of public assistance down to the average level of the country, and to keep it there, is also open to obvious objection.  If itwere sought to be achieved by some rate-equalisation scheme, the other LocalAuthorities of the country would be up in arms.     Moreover, the administrative  difficulties inherent in any scheme of rateequalisation are well illustrated by  the history of the Metropolitan Common PoorFund,  which existed from  1867 to  1930 for the purpose of spreading evenly overthe  Metropolis some  part  of  the expenditure on rating of  the 25 MetropolitanBoards of Guardians.  So long as the operation of the  Fund was confined mainly to  expenditure on institutional  relief,  no difficulties of a  serious order  were encountered.  When, however, in 1921, the function  of the Fund was extendedto cover expenditure  on out-relief,  machinery had at once to be devised to meetthe natural objection of the richer areas to bearing a part of the cost of uncontrolledexpenditure by some of the poorer areas on what they conceived to be an extravagantscale. The first device adopted was that of subjecting the Guardians&apos; administration to an elaborate system of scales and regulations prescribed by the Minister.  this proved unsatisfactory in practice, and for some years the expenditure on out-reliefchargeable to the Fund was limited to an arbitrary figure of 9d. per head per day.Finally, in 1928, the out-relief administration of the Guardians was brought underthe control of the Metropolitan Asylums Board.     If it  were sought to equalise  the  cost of public assistance over  the whole country by some such system as that of the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund, itcannot be supposed that the local authorities on whom the financial burden of thescheme would fall would be content with anything less than an arrangement  bywhich the Minister or some other central authority not only prescribed a uniformcode of scales and conditions  of relief but also exercised a close control over theday-to-day business of administration.     If the same object were sought to be achieved by ad hoc Exchequer grants,the plan would contain all, and more than  all, the vices of the Addison housing scheme finances.  The Local Authorities would be spending other people&apos;s moneywith no incentive at all to economic and efficient administration.  Further, as theMinistry of Health have already twice pointed out to Durham, if the Exchequer isto assume a continuing responsibility for all expenditure which a particular LocalAuthority may chqose to incur on a particular service  over the  national average for that service, complete  central control of the operations of that Authority inregard to that service must necessarily  follow.  Much the same  has been  said tothe Bishop  of llandaff&apos;s deputation from South Wales.  Obviously this conditionwould arouse much the same political criticism as transference to the unemployment assistance Board.     14. Another  course  and  one which  is open to less objection would  be the granting of financial assistance from the Exchequer in the shape of a defined sum to be  distributed among the  Authorities qualified to  receive a share.  these authorities could probably  be selected on a consideration of  the various  factorsmentioned in paragraphs 6 to 8 above but without any attempt to reduce the basisof selection to a formula.  Thus it hardly  appears necessary to  consider any areasother than Merthyr and the  Counties of Glamorgan, Monmouth and Durham. Whenthe areas had been so selected, it would no doubt be necessary at this stage to adopta formula for distributing the allotted sum among them.     15. Of the four possible courses mentioned the first three, namely---           (a) enlargement  of Commissioners&apos; powers (paragraph 11),           (6)  assumption  by a central authority of  responsibility  for public       assistance (paragraph 12), and           (c) rate  equalisation either by means  of  Exchequer assistance or of       contributions from the richer authorities (paragraph 13),are, as already pointed out, open to  serious objection.  The fourth course, namely,a limited grant to Merthyr and the three  counties (paragraph 14), is less difficultbut it  would undoubtedly subject the Government to strong pressure from highrated areas in general.(C 24100)
    A grant of a more limited kind which might avoid this danger and at the sametime bring assistance to districts most in need of it, might take the form of reliefagainst excessive water and sewerage charges on the lines set out below.    It is  found that the most highly  rated districts are in Monmouthshire andGlamorgan, and are those in which specially high charges fall to be borne for water and to some extent sewerage. In the main, these highly rated districts are supplied with  water  by the Taf Fechan and Abertillery  Water  Boards.  The reservoirsowned by these Boards were planned at a time when South Wales was prosperousand their  cost was much enhanced by high prices and rates of interest and (in one case) by the failure of the contractors.  Moreover, as a result of industrial depressionand declining population, the reservoirs are in excess of present requirements.  TheTaf Fechan Water Board,  for example,  has  a daily supply  of water of about16,000,000 gallons, of which some 7,000,000 are sold and 9,000,000 run to waste.The rates in the districts served by these Boards include a &quot; deficiency rate ;&apos;  inrespect  of water ranging up  to  5s. in the  .  This is  in addition to what theconsumer largely  identical with  the  ratepayer has   to pay in  direct watercharges, these being in many cases considerably in excess of the normal.    A similar situation exists, though  in  not  so pronounced a form, in regard  tosome other  Water Boards  and some sewerage authorities  (whether joint Boardsor individual Local Authorities).    The proposal is that some assistance  to meet the high charges on ratepayersand consumers in certain areas which will still remain after securing aU such reliefas can  be achieved by conversion might be given by contributions from theExchequer, either in the form of assistance to the Joint Boards themselves, e.g., by taking over  liability for  a percentage of outstanding  loan  charges  or to theconstituent  Authorities.    The cost  of a selective  grant of this character which would be given to, and limited to, those county districts where the need is most acute  would be much lessthan  the cost  of any grant to the County Council in aid of its general county rate,which would give similar relief to those districts.    For each  shilling in the   of rate relief so accorded to urban authorities in theSpecial Areas of South Wales with rates over 20s. in the   in 1935-36 (of whichthere were  20) the  cost  to  the  Exchequer would be approximately  85,000per annum.  A shilling relief to the County Rates of Glamorgan and  Monmouthwould cost  170,000.  The  expenditure of this latter sum on the  selective basishere  suggested would, it is estimated  in  conjunction with block-grant  revision,reduce the rates of practically all, if not all, the following  twenty areas to below20s. in the   :-                                                         Rate in 1935-36.                                                       s.  d.Abertillery       ............    29   0Merthyr Tydfil............    28   5Gellygaer  ..     ..     ..     ..     - -     - -     - -    zo   oMynyddyslwyn   ..     . .     . .     - -     - -     - -    25   6Caerphilly  . .     . .     . .     ..     - -     - -     - -    25   0Bedwellty  ..     -............    24   8Pontypridd      ..     . .     ..     - -     - -     - -    23  11Bedwas and Machen    . .     . .     . .     - -     - -    23   4Risca      ..............    23   4Mountain Ash    ............    23   0Abercarn   ..     . .     . .     ..      . -     - -     - -    22   9Rhondda   .-.     ..     ..........    22   6Tredegar   ..           ..     ..      --.                 22   4Aberdare   . .     . .     . .     ..      - -     - -     - -    22   3Rhymney  ..     ..     ..     ..      ..   ....           22   3Cwmbran  . .     ..     . .     ..      ..     . -     - -    21   0Nantyglo and Blaina    ..     ..      ..                 210Blaenavon        ..     ...     ..    ..--                 20  10Ogmore and Garw      ..     . .      . .     . -     - -    20   2Glyncorrwg      ..     ..     ..      .--                 20   0    It is of interest that in the County of Durham there was only one UrbanLocal Authority with a total rate of over 20s. in  1935-36.
    Some precedent for the principles underlying this form of assistance is to befound in the Local Government Act, 1929.   Under that Act a substantial partof the outstanding Goschen loans which had been advanced to Boards of Guardianswas wiped out at the cost of the* Exchequer and another provision  of the  Actenabled assistance albeit not  from the  exchequer but from  the County Council to be given to individual expenditure, incurred or to be incurred, on  works ofsewage and water supply.    So far as can be seen,  all the hard  cases in Glamorgan and Monmouthshirewould be assisted  in  this way.  The situation does not arise in Durham, wherewater is  in the main supplied by companies, and Local Authorities have in thepast avoided  incurring large expenditure on sewage disposal.    In so far as the  absence of heavy expenditure in Durham on sewage works is  due to the  fact that necessary works remain to be executed (and this  is  the main reason), the Local Authorities  can look  to the Commissioner to assist under his existing powers the execution of works in the future and have no legitimate ground of complaint  if a grant designed to relieve high expenditure in the past  does notnot come their way.    It is to be noted that District Councils at present in receipt of SupplementaryExchequer Grants  under the Local Government Act,  1929, are protesting againstthe annual reduction  of these grants which is now proceeding under the terms ofthat Act.  A scheme on the above lines should go far to dispose of the cases of hardship which result from  the  increases of local  rates  following  from such reductions.    It is suggested that the provision dealing with proposed grant should givea  wide discretion  and should  merely mention certain factors  to be  taken intoaccount.   The provision might run on some such lines as follows :     Power for the Minister of Health,  subject  to such conditions  as he  mayattach, to make contributions  towards the expenses incurred, whether before or after the commencement of the Act, by the Council of a Borough or an Urban orRural District scheduled as a Special Area or by a Joint Board whose area consistswholly or partly of Boroughs or Districts so  scheduled in the provision of sewersor sewage disposal works  or water supply, if it appears to  him to be reasonableso to do having regard to the relevant circumstances including           (a) the  resources of the Council or of the Joint Board or its  constituent      Authorities ;          (b) the need of such provision  to meet present and prospective  demands      as compared with the prospective demands at the time when the expenditure      was incurred ;          (c) any special circumstances affecting the cost of the work  provided      or the rate of interest at which the money for  such works was borrowed ;      and          id) the  present and  prospective charge upon  ratepayers entailed by      provision so made.    16.  Reference  has already been made to the question of central control.  Thefigures given  in appendices  attached indicate that in  some of the Special areas the proportion  of grant-borne to rate-borne expenditure is already so  high as toraise the issue of control, and that issue must become acute  if the proportion ismaterially increased, as it will be, by the operation of block grant revision and still more so  if any such grants as is here contemplated were super-added.  Inaddition, account must be taken of the strong movement led by the South WalesEconomy Association for the need, even in present circumstances, of some outsidecontrol to tone up, and clean up, local administration in South Wales.    17.  The  possibilities to be  considered range  from complete supersession ofcertain Authorities to the appointment of &quot; advisers &quot; who would be in a positionto  attend meetings,  scrutinise  estimates, accounts and  other documents and,perhaps call  for special audits or inspections, and, by their influence  with  theAuthority, secure an improvement in administration.    18.  Supersession could no doubt be contemplated if there were clear  evidenceof maladministration giving rise to a state of affairs such as obtained in  West Hamwhen  the Boards of Guardians (Default)  Act, 1926, was passed.  But it is clear(C 24100)F2
that the formula of that Act (&quot; that the Boards of Guardians have ceased or areacting in such  a manner as will render them unable to discharge all or any ofthe functions exercisable by the Board &quot;) would not meet  the  present position.Deplorable as is the state of some of the Special-Areas, it cannot be said either thatthe Local Authorities have ceased to-discharge their functions, or are so dischargingthem as to make their future discharge impossible.  No doubt lax administration,more particularly in the sphere of public assistance, adds to the burdens of therate payers, but it is not a primary factor in the economic condition of the areas.     19. It seems, therefore, that supersession would have  to  be justified, noton the ground of a failure or default on the part of the Local Authority,  but uponthe ground of the high proportion of their total expenditure, which is, or will be,borne by the Exchequer.  It can hardly be doubted if this course were taken thatthe Government would be represented  as seizing the opportunity of the financialdistress of the  areas (distress due in the main to circumstances  quite outside thecontrol  of their inhabitants) to  deprive  the population of their fundamentalpolitical  rights.  Moreover,  if  supersession  were contemplated, it would  be  aquestion whether the  Authorities should be superseded as  regards the whole oftheir functions  or whether the supersession should be limited to public assistance.Complete supersession, including the supersession  of the  functions  of a LocalEducation Authority,  would create intense  resentment.  On the  other  hand,  ifsupersession were limited to the sphere of public assistance, it would be recognised as indicating an intention to cut down relief and to effect  economy by a rigidapplication of the means  test.  Further, a partial supersession of a Local authority would probably create difficulties which were  not  experienced  under  the  WestHam Act, since it would involve a proportion of the staff  serving two masters.     20. An alternative to compulsory supersession would be a provision underwhich all their  powers and duties would be voluntarily relinquished by the LocalAuthority in return for  substantial Exchequer  assistance.   This possibility was recently  explored in  connection with  Merthyr  Tydfil,  but the conclusion wasreached that it would be scarcely less unpopular than compulsory supersessionand would have difficulties of its own.  It would be represented  as an endeavourto persuade the local  Councillors to  sell their birthright for a  mess  of pottage.A number of Councils would probably refuse  assistance on these terms.  (Theexperience of the North-East  Housing  Association affords some  guidance on thispoint.   Under  the terms of the arrangements between the Association and theCommissioner,  Local Authorities can be provided with houses for replacing slumsfree of all cost to their rates.   A number of Authorities have  refused this temptingoffer.)     21. A further matter for consideration is whether it would be practicable to devise a system lying  half-way  between supersession and the appointment of  an&quot; adviser.&quot;  This would  presumably  take  the  form of appointing  a  residentGovernment  representative  armed with the  power  of  vetoing  expenditure.  Itseems very doubtful, however,  whether a merely negative  power of  veto would suffice.   Powers of initiative,  e.g., a  power to organise a satisfactory system ofrelieving officers would be necessary if much is to be achieved and, if the power of veto is extended so as to include a positive power of initiating action or approving the action of the Authority, the Government representative becomes in effect afull-blown  Commissioner, but  with the disadvantage  of having a  recalcitrantCouncil to advise him.     22.  The remaining possibility, that of appointing an &quot; adviser &quot; on the modelof the arrangements made last  year with Merthyr Tydfil,  would be open to less objection.  The difficulty of finding suitable persons for such appointments wouldbe  not  inconsiderable, and the value  of the  experiment  would depend  on the advisers being persons of  first-rate capacity and considerable public standing.  It isthought  that the need for them is probably  confined to one or  two Counties: inSouth Wales.    If the payment of any special grant were discretionary it would beopen to the Minister to secure an agreement from any Local Authority to acceptthe service of an &quot; adviser &quot; on conditions similar to those on which the Chairmanof the Welsh Board of Health has been accepted by Merthyr.
    23. There remains the question whether and  by what method Exchequerassistance should be  given, to make possible  the institution or development ofdesirable services.    As mentioned in paragraph  10, the starvation  of certain special services in parts of the Special Areas is alleged in addition to, or as  a consequence of, thegeneral financial difficulties of the Local Authorities ;  and  this is unquestionablytrue in certain parts of the Areas as regards  the school medical  and analogousservices and the maternity and child welfare service.   It is arguable that a grant inrelief of the present rate burden would in itself tend to secure more generous treat-ment of the services which are at present under-developed.   But it seems open togreat doubt whether,  at any rate in some of the Areas  concerned, this consequencewould  actually flow from such a  grant.  Moreover, the need  for developing theservices referred to is very much in the public mind in connection with the general question of nutrition and the improvement of national physique, and for that reason it seems probable that these services could be treated  exceptionally and that the offer of assistance towards them would  not  be regarded as constituting a claim for the similar treatment of other services.   On the whole,  therefore, there seemsto be a strong case for providing assistance towards the services referred to though there are arguments to the contrary which are set out in the  reservation by theTreasury at the end of this memorandum.    24. As regards the method of providing such assistance, it is to be noted thatthe present powers of the Commissioner in  this respect are limited in two ways            (1) He can only subsidise &quot;works &quot; and cannot assist  &quot; services &quot; on       revenue account ; and           (2) Within these limits he is further limited to works  which are not       specifically grant aided.The simplest course would appear to be to enlarge the  powers of the Commissionerby enabling him to  give grants  at his discretion  towards the services  already referred to, naming these specifically in the Bill.   One advantage of this coursewould  be that, without any special statutory provision, the Commissioner could,as a condition of making a grant, take steps to secure  that the  money so providedis spent for the purpose for which the grant is designed.  It would be necessary toprovide in the Bill that in making these grants the Commissioner should consult theDepartment concerned, and in  practice he would no doubt utilise  the services oftheir officers for any necessary investigations.                                  SCOTLAND    25. Although the statistics and other particulars in this Report relate to theSpecial Areas in England and Wales, the Scottish position has been kept in viewthroughout the memorandum and the considerations to which attention is drawnshould be regarded as applying mutatis mutandis to the Special Areas in Scotland.With regard to paragraph 22, the need for appointing &quot; advisers &quot; which exists inone or two Counties in South Wales does not appear to exist in  the case of any ofthe Scottish local authorities concerned.    Appendix G sets out the districts in the Scottish Special Areas having rates inexcess of 16s. which corresponds to a rate of 20s. in England and  Wales.         RESERVATION BY THE TREASURY ON PARAGRAPHS 23  AND 24.    1. The proposal to extend the Commissioners powers under the conditionsproposed to include grants to local  authorities for  &quot; services &quot; is in the opinion ofthe Treasury open to  serious objection.    2. &quot; Works &quot;  are  capital items and  assistance towards their cost is by its nature temporary and non-recurrent.  &quot; Services  &quot; on the other hand  are con-tinuing.  Assistance to them is simply assistance towards the clay to day expenditureof local authorities.  It could hardly be temporary in duration ; it is in fact simplya new Government grant towards local expenditure.(C 24100)F3
    3. It is true that it is contemplated in paragraphs&apos; 23 and 24 that it  wouldbe limited to a narrowly defined range of services and that it would be administeredwithin those services  under close Departmental control.  It is, however, open to doubt whether legislation on the subject of new Exchequer aid by the Commissionercould be secured in terms of  a narrow definition of the range of services. And itis  open to still  more doubt  whether a scheme which depends for its successfulworking  on such close  contact between the Commissioner and  the  department concerned that  the Commissioner would in effect be under the control of theDepartment would be acceptable in view of the reiterated complaints that theCommissioner is already too  much hampered by Departmental restrictions.   and yet&apos; the grant of any  appreciable degree of independence to the  Commissioner asregards this type of  assistance is clearly  fraught  with the  most  serious risks,administrative and financial.    4. The  proposal as the Treasury see it  involves an obvious and serious riskof starting new widespread subsidies to a certain type of local authority.   moreover the basis of subsidy (viz.,  development) would if not from the  outset at least froman early date lead to striking and  indefensible  difference of treatment  between one authority and another.   The authority who have  provided the services inquestion,  possibly by severe economies in  other  directions, get  nothing.   Theauthority which has regarded public assistance as having the first and  last callon all available funds  will get the new grants.

APPENDIX II.CABINET.D.A.  (34)  11.COMMITTEE  ON THE  REPORTS  OF THE  COMMISSIONERS  FOR                            SPECIAL  AREAS.               NOTE BY THE  CHANCELLOR OF THE  EXCHEQUER,    I CIRCULATE herewith a Note prepared in  the Treasury with referenceto the Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee (D.A. (34) 10) on the Reportsof the Commissioners for the Special Areas.                                                   (Initialled)      N. C.    Treasury Chambers, January 15,  1937.                          NOTE BY THE TREASURY.     THE Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee (D.A. (34) 10) examinesproposals for dealing with areas of heavy unemployment by way of the SpecialAreas Act.   The following notes  deal with  Government  action in aid of those areas in other ways, viz. :               I. Government  Contracts.             II. Government  Establishments.     It also  gives estimates of the financial commitments involved  in the present act and in the extensions which are discussed in the Report.                   I. Allocation of Government Contracts.     It has for some considerable time past been the policy of the Government togive a preference to tenders received from firms in certain scheduled areas.  Theareas participating in this preference, which are determined by the Ministry ofLabour on the basis of the percentage of unemployment that has obtained in thearea over a substantial period  of time, include all the present Special Areas, aswell as other areas of heavy unemployment, many of which are preferring claims to be  classified as Special Areas.  The  principles laid  down  by the House ofCommons for Government contracts does not allow of an absolute  preference to firms in  the scheduled areas, but only a  preference &quot; other things being equal,&quot;and the practice of  the Contracting Departments is therefore to give sympathetic-consideration within the frame-work of the system of competitive tendering to firms in those areas (with preference when tenders are equal inequality and price,and delivery rate is adequate), with special regard to the possibility of allocatingorders to them as the opportunity arises for widening the existing field of supply.The effect of this policy has undoubtedly been to divert to the Special and otherdepressed Areas a substantial quantity of work, which would otherwise have beendone in other districts.   Over the period the 1st April, 1935-the 30th November,1936, direct contracts to a total value of over  41,000,000 have  been placed bythe  Defence Departments alone in  the  areas to which  the  preference applies.Moreover,  these  were  orders  placed in the  initial stages  of  the  defence programme; they will increase as the Programme progresses.  This tendency is illustrated by the fact that, whereas the  value of orders placed in these areas inthe whole of 1935-36 amounted to  17,000,000, the value of such orders in thefirst half of 1936-37 amounted to   19,000,000.     It has been estimated that out of the  41,000,000 orders &quot;referred to above,-orders valued at  24,000,000 have been placed in the Special Areas.       [14432]
    In addition to the preference given to the Special and Depressed Areas in placing Government Contracts, a preference is accorded, other things being equal,to the Special Areas in the allocation of contracts for work initiated under theRailways  (Agreement)  Act,  1935,   and   the  London  Passenger  Transport(Agreement)  Act,  1935.   For the period ending June 1936,  the latest date towhich the available information relates, contracts under these Acts were placedin the Special Areas to the amount of   1,702,000.          II. Location of Government Factories in the Special Areas.    The Contracting Departments have also kept in the forefront the desirabilityof locating new establishments in the Special Areas, where circumstances renderthis practicable.  The work provided  by the construction of the buildings already begun or in contemplation will in itself provide a large amount of employmentlocally; moreover, the establishment  of the factories in the Special  Areas is aconsiderable contribution  to the permanent well-being of these areas, since theywill afford a measure of continuous employment, even when the present deficiencyprogramme  is  made  good.    On  the other hand,  a  certain number  of  these establishments are not intended for  operation to meet the requirements of the deficiency  Programme, but as reserve capacity to  meet  War  demands in  anemergency.  Consequently, the employment provided by them in peace will notbe large.    The decision to reprovide certain of  the Royal Ordnance  Factories fromWoolwich and to duplicate the capacity, for explosive purposes, of the LCI. works at Billingham in areas less vulnerable strategically than the Thames Mouth andTyneside, provided an opportunity of erecting large Government establishments in the Distressed and Special Areas, of which the fullest use has been made.  the choice of sites has  been limited by a number of considerations.   The factoriescannot be erected on the north-east coast on grounds of vulnerability to air attack.Further conditions are imposed by manufacturing  requirements an explosivefactory needs large quantities of water. Nevertheless, it has been found  possibleto locate all these factories either within  Special or Distressed  Areas,  or  nearenough to provide opportunities for employment to the inhabitants of those areas,as the following table shows :     South Wales          (a) Factories approved                Filling Factory : Bridgencl.         (b) Factories in prospect or under  consideration -               Filling Factory : Glascoed.               T.N.T.  Factory :  Pembrey.               Ammonia  Factory : Location undecided.                  Total value (approximately),   12,500,000.    Lancashire          (Approved and work proceeding)                Filling  Factory :  Chorley  (midway  between  Blackburn  and                   Wigan).                     Value (approximately),  6,500,000.    Cumberland-         (In prospect)                T.N.T.  Factory :  Site under consideration                     Value (approximately),  1,000,000.    South- West Scotland          (All approved)                T.N.T.  Factory : Irvine.               Cordite Factory :  Bishopton.               Cordite Factory (extension) : Ardeer.               Ammonia  Factory: Lanarkshire  (location  undecided).                   Total  value (approximately),  ^000,000.
     In addition  to the Ordnance Factory programme, which provides  for  theerection of Government factories under Government management, steps havebeen taken to increase manufacturing capacity to meet other needs of the defence programme, either by the erection of Government factories to be managed by commercial firms as agents of the Government, or by the addition to the existingplant of private  manufacturers of extensions financed by the  Government.  Inthese cases the consideration governing the choice of site has  been  the location of the firm which is to operate the new plant on behalf of the Government. Wherethe operating  firm is a concern already engaged in armaments work, this factorhas favoured the Distressed and Special Areas.  As  regards armament factories in the  Special  Areas,  the outstanding  example is the purchase now being negotiated by the  Admiralty  of Messrs. Armstrong  Whitworth&apos;s Works atScotswood, Newcastle-on-Tyne, to be operated by Messrs. Vickers  Armstrongsfor the manufacture of guns and other munitions.   Other examples of projectsapproved are  a petrol container  factory  at Llandacy, and an incendiary bombfactory (to be managed by 1.0.1.) at Linlithgow; while  among the projects in prospect is a &quot; shadow &quot; aircraft factory in Dumbartonshire.  On the other hand,the other aircraft and aero-engine &quot; shadow &quot; factories are being erected by  theAir  Ministry  on sites outside the distressed areas.  These  factories  must beadjacent to the works of the motor-car firms which  will  manage them, and  theMidlands is the nucleus of the motor-car industry.                       III. Financial Commitments.    The commitments entered into by the Commissioners  under the  present Actup to the 31st December,  1936,  amounted to about  7,500,000 in England  andWales and about  1,500,000 in  Scotland.  Of  these commitments, only about 2,300,000 has so far been discharged in cash. The position therefore is that an extensive range of measures has been initiated, but that only about one-quarterof the expenditm-e they will ultimately  involve  has so far  been  incurred.  it follows therefore that, the effects so far visible give  little  indication of the realmagnitude of the measures.    The range of measures can be seen from the analysis in the Third Reportof the English Commissioner of the commitments up to the 30th September, 1936,when they  totalled about  300,000 less than in December, viz. :          Industry             Trading Estates and Clearance of Sites......     1,429,000    Other industrial schemes (Harbours, &amp;c.)Health    .........-    .........HousingAgriculture (Small Holdings, &amp;c.)Social Schemes  ...     ...     ...Miscellaneous  565,0002,476,000  191,0001,952,000  518,000   69,000                                                               7,200,000    The extension of the period of operation of the Act in relation to the presentareas will  cause some  increase in the total of commitments.   On  many of the items, e.g., Health, the field of activity has been so far covered that  (unless, ofcourse, new types  of schemes  are admitted for grant), future  commitments arenot likely to be incurred at anything like the same rate as in the  past.  The major-future liability under the present Act is likely to be Site Clearance and Develop-ment on which considerable sums might be spent according to the range of activityundertaken.  This expenditure would be to some extent ultimately recoverable,or  at least revenue producing.   This particular activity  would be further increased under the proposals for inducements to industry.  It  is not possibleto give even the roughest approximation of what might be involved.  All that can be said is that it  is clearly a matter  in which the range of  activity mighthave to be limited  in the light  of the funds  agreed to be made available for it.    Other  proposals in the report involve smaller sums.  The  extension of theprogramme of Land Settlement  would cost  800,000.   The two proposals on road works (residential and private roads)  would each cost up to   250,000.
    If  the  areas  are extended, financial commitments would  be much more serious.  The extension of site clearance and development activities would involvesums in the new areas on the same scale as the large sums involved in the presentareas.  But  in addition to this, extension of  the full  powers of the Act to other areas would inevitably necessitate not merely this expenditure on site  clearancebut also expenditure on schemes other than  sites corresponding to the schemes which will cost some four-fifths (say  7,000,000) of the total commitments in thepresent areas.  In other words, if site clearance were  on  a scale costing (say) 5,000,000 (including present commitments)  in the present areas, then doubling the areas would not merely  add  5,000,000 to the cost for  site clearance in thenew areas, but would also  add  another   7,000,000  for the cost  of the other schemes which would have to be undertaken in the new areas.
.A. (3-j--) ...3-3 .CAB I N E T,COif 1ITTEE ON THE REPORTS OP THE. GQMMISSIQNfiRS          FOR SPECIAL AREAS..       Memorandum b;r the Chancel! or  of the Exchequer.1.     Since the Meeting of the Committee on the  26th.ultimo I have been considering further the alternative proposals rs regards sites and buildings for new  industries on which I undertook.to circulate a  paper.   In dealingwith this question it will be convenient to discuss alsothe general question of assistance to industry both in thepresent Special Areas end in the other areas which havebeen under discussion.   A.   Sites and Buildings in appropriate areas outside                     the Special-Areas.2.      As regards sites and buildings outside the presentSpecial Areas, the Commit tee are aware that it has beensuggested that in a number of parts  of the country which  arehard hit by prolonged unemployment but which in general, make no claim to be treated as Special Areas,assistance might  begiven by the Government to enable sites to be acquired andthe buildings en them cleared and rebuilt or adapted  inorder that they may attract industrial tenants.   Thesuggestion has beer, mad;:; in particular by parts of Lancashire4&quot;.3.      A good deal has already been done in some areas inthis way on an economic basis without assistance.  In theareas for which assistance; is suggested, it is not proposedthat schemes should necessarily be uneconomic.    Thesuggestion is rather that a measure  of State assistance and                      -!-      A Note by Sir Horace Wils on en the attitude r-f      Lancashire is attache-do
m encouragement is necessary to start local interests in motion. 4.   To give effect to this suggestion., a company (presumably a.Public Utility Company with limited dividend) would be formed.   It would raise capital and invest it in sites and buildings and would adapt those buildings as may be necessary,   It would hope to let them at economic rent So   As it did so, it would have assets on which it could raise, further share capital or could increase its scale of operations by raising money on loan. 5.   If a Company were formed on this oasis, the form of help likely to be of most practical use would be the-subscription by the taxpayer of part of the capital. 6.   As to what that part should be, I have considered framing the necessary Act in general terms and when it is passed striking a separate bargain with each ares, which is qualified to benefit.   But this course does not seem practicable and I think the Government should make up their mind what is a reasonable proportion to subscribe and then specify that proportion in the Statute&apos;.   As regards the amount, it would appear that a low percentage would suffice and S5fo is suggested as a reasonable figure,, 7.   The machinery for administering this assistance is discussed later.   As regards the machinery for determining the areas, it is suggested that the new scheme should apply to any area which is certified to satisfy closely defined conditions as to intensity and duration of unemployment, dependence on a single industry and absence of prospects of recovery, if not aided in this way.     Certificationmight be by the Minister of Labour after examination of
 claims for  inclusion by a Committee.   The Minister should not have power to  include any area which is not recommended. for inclusion by the committee  B. Financial Aesistsuice to New Industries. 8.-  This measure  of assistance alone would probably not satisfy in  full the areas in question having regard to the wider range of powers now available in the Special Areas.   I  have accordingly considered whether further assistance  could be made available and in this connection have considered also the position in the Special Areas, 9&quot;.   As regards the Special Areas, suggestions have been made by Sir George Gillett and Lord portal that financial assistance  by loan should be made available to enable undertakings to establish themselves in the Special Areas. Their proposals rest on the fundamental assumption that there are undertakings of substance which would establish themselves, in whole or by branches, in the Special Areas if they could receive a sufficient inducement &quot;by way of capital assistance.   S.A/R.A. is already available to help small  concerns.   The Nuffield Trust is available also to help large .and small but is understood to contem- plate assistance mainly by a share in the equity.   It is suggested that these two sources of assistance leave a gapwhich the new proposals are designed to fill. 10.  I consider that something should be done to meet these suggestions both in relation to Special Areas andto the other areas discussed in the first part of thismemorandum, and to that end I am ready to provide a sum of money which would be available to assist the establish^merit of new industrial undertakings in the  form of a loan of capital  on favourable  terms.    In the Special Areas,  the                       -3-
new money would be a supplement to Nuffield and S.A.R..A;.In the other areas, it would stand alone but would boworked in co-operation with the arrangements for theprovision of sites and buildings.11.     I am prepared to find  8,000,000 for this purpose.12,     The method of administration requires consideration.The inability of the Commissioners to operate outside-Special Areas,  the desirability of securing uniformity ofadministration over the whole field and the need for the closest co-operation in the Special Areas with the NuffieldTrust and S.A.R.A. all lead to the conclusion that theadministration of the new scheme should be in the hands ofLord Portal and Sir Nigel Campbell.   It would not,however,  be politically possible to hand over a large sumof money to be administered without Parliamentary controland, after considering a number &apos;;,f alternatives, I proposethat the actual administration should be in the hands ofthe Treasury, acting on the advice of a Committee whichwould consist of those two gentlemen and possibly a third.13,     It is not, I thin/.., desirable, that the new arrange-ments should apply to major motters such as oil from coaletc. where other considerations (e.g. taxation, defence,etc.) arise.   A maximum limit should probably be includedin the Act to the amount which may be adAranced in any individual case.14.     The administrative arrangement proposed would be a convenient means of administering the grants for the sitecompanies referred to in paragraph 4.   I do not intendthe  2,000,000 for assistance to industry to includegrants for the site companies.

              ENCLOSURE TO APPENDIX III.                   LAKOASim^C.               Note by Sir ft.  Wilson. Chancellor of the,Exchequer.        Sir Joseph Nail M.P. (who is,  I think, Chairman of the Lanershire Members) came to see me a few clayr, ago to discuss the position of some of the Lana ships towns in relation to the proposed Special Areas legislation.   He said there was a very general feeling against being labelled a &quot;Special Area&quot;:  that was net what they wanted.   But they did feel that some assistance was desirable.   He thought that opinion in Lancashire would ba satisfied if tho Government would adopt the suggestion about the clearance of factory sites in towns such ag Blackburn end Wigan, and would assist in the provision.of finance for the purchase of sites and the erection of suitable new factories.  This would be felt to be supple- menting the efforts of the Lancashire Industrial Development Council to attract new worKS into Lancashire - efforts which seem to be bearing fruit.       Sir Joseph Nail then went on to say that he thought assistance would also be needed to provide capital in the case of some of the projected new works.   He appreciated that the Nuffield fund could not be used (unless, which he agreed was undesirable, the area was made a Special Area) but he thought it would be politic for the Government to offer something as an alternative.   If site-clearance? were possible, together with some Kind of finance, he thought he could carry the Lancashire Members.       Yesterday Sir Thomas Earlow, who is Chairman of theLancashire  Industrial Development Council, came to see me.                        -1-
He referred to the views he had expressed, with generalagreement, at the meeting of the Council on the 25th January,viz: that Lancashire did not want to he a Special Area hutdid want to he able to go in for site development, and saidthat he thought he could get his Council (which includesindustrial, commercial, transport etc. interests as well asthe Local Authorities) to support the Government if we would assist in the promotion and operation of a &quot;Public UtilityCorporationnto tsuy and develop sitos in the more depressedLancashire towns.  Ho is personally against the provision of factory finance in addition (and most strongly againstsubsidies such as refund of rates and income tax) but I thinkhe will find that Sir Joseph Nail1s view is right and that inorder to gain the support of the Lancashire interests it willbe necessary both to aid the establishment of the SitesCompany and to be ready to provide some form of factoryfinance.      Sir Joseph Nell and Sir Thomas Barlow speak with authority in Lancashire (they are in close touch with theDevelopment Council which has made a point of maintainingcontact with the 1ocal Members of Parliament) and their support- would be valuable.
