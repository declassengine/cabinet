Memorandum by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.    THE Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on Reserves ofFood  and  Feeding-Stuffs, appointed on the  21st  April,  1936,  has held fivemeetings, and, though it is not yet in a position to make its final recommendations.it has agreed upon an important recommendation, which I now submit.                             Present Position.Dependence on Imports.    2.  Broadly speaking, in regard to food for human consumption, the UnitedKingdom is dependent on imported supplies  for rather more than 60 per cent.measured in energy content (calories).   Measured in terms of retail value, thefigure for imports is just over 50 per cent.  For some of the more important items the percentage of imports is :                                                         Percentage        Commodity                                    Imported.            Wheat and flour............     ...      90SugarMeat (including bacon) ...Fats (butter, lard and margarine)CheeseEggs    ............7053896738    3.   But the United Kingdom is, in fact, more dependent on imported suppliesthan the above figures would suggest.  The contributions made by home production to the  last four  items  are  dependent to an appreciable  extent upon imported feeding-stuffs. This is, also the case in regard to the liquid milk supply, thewhole of which is provided from home sources.    4.   With regard to two important categories  of  feeding-stuffs, the positionis as follows :-                                          Percentage                                                        Imported.             Cereals and cereal by-products      ...    ...      65             Oilcake and meal  (in the form of oilseeds or                manufactured cake)     ...    ...    ...    100                              Normal Stocks.    5.   Stocks of cereals and sugar are at their maximum just after the homeharvest, whilst just before the harvest  they are at their minimum.  The lowestamounts of stocks of food and feeding-stuffs at any given time are approximatelyas follows :         Wheat and flour : Eight and a half weeks&apos; consumption.        Sugar :  Six weeks&apos; consumption.        Meat (excluding animals) : Less than one week&apos;s consumption.        Butter :  Less than one week&apos;s consumption.        Lard and margarine :  Less than one week&apos;s consumption.        Cereals  for  livestock :   Imported supplies  negligible.  Home  crop            decreases as season progresses.        Oilseed cake :  Nine to ten weeks&apos;-consumption.      [14687]                                                      B
Need for Reserves.     6.   It is clear that sea-borne trade in imported food and feeding-stuffs must continue.   The  Naval  and  Air  Staffs  were  asked to  report  how&apos; far  our supplies of imported food and raw materials were likely  to be interfered with by enemy attacks, particularly from -the  air,  and as to the various steps to be taken to counter such attack.  The Chiefs of Staff have made two reports on the matter, and whilst they are unable,  in  view of the many  unpredictable factors concerned, to answer the problem in terms of the percentage of supplies likely to be cut off, they are satisfied that, in the event of  war with Germany, so far as enemy naval action is concerned, the threat to our supplies is not likely to be comparable with  that faced and overcome  in  1914-18 (provided the necessary counter-measures  are prepared in time of  peace).  On the other hand, as regards air attack, they say          &quot; We consider that, if and when  a  first-class Power, whose air bases lie     within air-striking  range of our Home Waters,  decides to concentrate  the     greater part of his air strength on unrestricted air attack against our supply     system,  the position might become extremely serious..  In such  an event,     unless our counter-offensive and defensive measures can within a short period     effectively reduce the scale of attack, the shipping losses, combined with  the     dislocation at the docks and other  vital points in the distribution system,     resulting both from material damage  and its subsequent moral effect, might     affect the maintenance of our supplies to an extent we have never hitherto   -  experienced.&quot;     7.  In view of this conclusion, the Sub-Committee on Food Supplies feels that it is necessary in peace-time to make some provision against  the possible interrupt tion of our imported supplies of food and feeding-stuffs.  In the 1914-18 war, at the time when pressure on the available shipping was at its height, food supplies were given priority over munitions.  Under altered conditions we have now to face, in  a  future  European war, the  possibility of a far  more serious, thoughtemporary, dislocation in the supply of imported food and  its distribution from certain existing storage  centres than any  we experienced in the last war.   Wecannot in my view assume responsibility for meeting such a situation, without having taken every step that is  reasonably  practicable  to  provide  against suchan emergency  in  advance.  The Sub-Committee is satisfied that the need  forsome accumulation of reserves in peace-time is  fully established.                       Composition of Reserve Stocks.     8.  The next question is &quot; What reserves  shall  we acmimulate and how much? &quot;     At the request of the Sub-Committee Sir E.  Gowers has  undertaken enquirieswith the trades concerned regarding the possibilities of storing all the foods thatare placed in the &quot; essential &quot; category by  the Ministry of Health,  namely :          Beef.                                 Butter.         Mutton and lamb.                     Cheese.         Bacon.                               Canned foods.         Lard.                     &apos;           Oil-seeds and whale oil.         Sugar.                               Cod liver oil.     His  investigations show that the practical  possibilities of storage  vary to amarked extent with the different commodities.  Some of them in the form inwhich they are consumed in this country  cannot be stored  at all.   Chilled beef and, for various technical and trade reasons, bacon cannot be kept in cold storage.Butter deteriorates relatively quickly.     As regards quantity, it is impracticable to store a larger quantity of any commodity than can be turned over before deterioration takes place.  This limits the amount stored  to the  amount consumed in any given period multiplied by thenumber of such periods for which the commodity will keep in store.  In the caseof butter, for example, the maximum that could be  stored, if it were desirable todo so, would be about eight weeks&apos; consumption, whilst in  the case of beef, theamount stored could not exceed one month&apos;s supply.  In any  case, chilled beef, thenormal consumption of which is four times that of frozen beef, cannot be stored.
    There are objections to cold storage.  It is very expensive and it is vulnerablenot only in its dependence on a supply of power, but in the location of existingspare accommodation.    9.  Sir Ernest Gowers accordingly has recommended, and the Sub-Committeehas endorsed his view, that  a policy of food reserves can only be framed on thebasis of making a selection of such supplies as circumstances permit.  In makinghis choice consideration  was given not only  to  the convenience and.  relativeinexpensiveness with which  particular commodities could be stored, but  to theirdietetic value, their conformity with the programme for home production of food in war time,  and the  contribution which would be made by their storage to themost economical use of shipping.    10.  On  these  grounds  his conclusions were in  favour  of storing  wheat,cereals and oil-seeds for our livestock, vegetable oils and whale oil for margarineand.imitation lard, raw  sugar, cheese, which can be kept in cellars  withoutcold storage, and  canned  milk  and  meat.   The  Sub-Committee on food supplies accepts these conclusions.    11.  This list,  however, is deficient in  animal  fats.  There  is no store of butter, bacon or lard, and the canned  meat lacks  the  normal proportion  of  fat.It is necessary also to take  account of the probability that  the  large imports ofbacon and butter which  come to  this country  from  Denmark and neighbouring countries  may, for  various  reasons,  virtually cease.    12.  The  Sub-Committee has considered this question at some  length, butthey have found no practicable solution.   A reserve of lard is unprocurable inpresent circumstances (though these may shortly change), whilst reserves of bacon and butter could only be secured and then  only to a  limited  extent by anupheaval of the ordinary trade customs, and at a cost which could not be contem-plated by  any Government in peace time.   The inadequacy of reserves of  animalfats, however, can  be faced if there  is a relatively large  reserve  available ofvegetable  oils and whale oil, and on the assumption  which the Sub-Committeethinks is  reasonable that our import  trade, though interfered  with, will  stillcontinue to a large  extent, and that, in that trade, a high priority will be givento the supply of  animal fats.                         The Size of Reserve Stocks.    13.  In  considering  the  size of  reserve  stocks to be  acquired, the  Sub-Committee feel, in the first place, that there are two situations which might haveto be faced, separately or in combination, or perhaps a more likely contingency the second developing from the first:     (a) a serious and perhaps complete dislocation of imports to, and distribution           arrangements from,. certain east coast ports, notably London, for a           limited period which would be ended by our getting  the better of the    - -      enemy,  during which a diversion of imports  to,  and distributed from,           other less vulnerable ports would be arranged.    (b) an all-round appreciable  curtailment  in the imported  supplies to this           country throughout a prolonged war.    They do  not feel that consideration need be given to a situation in which theUnited Kingdom would find itself virtually in a besieged state, deprived of  all or substantially all imports, during a prolonged war.  It would  be impracticable to provide against such a contingency by the accumulation of i&apos;eserves in advance,whilst, if the situation ever arose, the war would be lost for reasons other  thanthose connected with the supply of food.    14.  Secondly, the Sub-Committee considers  that any reserve stocks shouldbe regarded  as an insurance against temporary  interruptions  of import tradearising not only from enemy attack, but also,  for example, from the temporarydiversion of  shipping to meet some other emergency requirement.  They shouldnot be  used as a means of meeting a continuing  shortage,  though in the second       [14687]                   &quot;                    &apos;       &apos;     B. 2
situation envisaged above it might be necessary to use them as one of the means,supplemented by others, e.g., by rationing on a dower basis of consumption thanthe present relatively high figure, to help tide over the period until larger home-produced supplies became available.  Even in this case, however, the reserves, mustbe looked upon as an insurance and not as a full cover against  all possible risks.The period required to bring home-production up to a maximum  depends on thetime of year at which war breaks out, and might be as long as fifteen to eighteen months with a war starting in the spring.  In the view of the Sub-Committee itwould be  quite impracticable to provide  reserves to meet  the  full  deficiencyarising from the absence of imports over such a period.     15.  The Sub-Committee has given detailed consideration to four alternativeplans, the  approximate financial aspects of which,  based on present prices,  are summarised in the following table :--                                                                Annual Costs                                                             (including Interest.......                                                 on  the Revolving                                                             Fund and Capital                                          Cost of Extra          Expenditure and                        Cost of          Storage Accommoda-        Depreciation on                     Acquisition            tion (Capital            the Capital                   (Revolving Fund).         Expenditure).           Expenditure).                                                                          Plan I   ...      5,280,000               Nil                 500,000     Plan II  ...     20,820,000            1,480,000            .1,350,000     Plan III...     42,330,000           15,150,000            3,560,000     Plan IV  ...     54,510,000           26,010,000            5,030,000     16.  The Appendix shows in tabular form the  proposals comprised in  thefour Plans  respectively.  Plan I is designed to meet a temporary dislocation of the distributive mechanism of London through air attacks on docks and markets.     17.  Plan II  is the smallest programme which, in the opinion of the Sub-Committee, could  be regarded as  a  genuine attempt  to provide an  insurance against risks of an interruption  of food imports for the United  Kingdom as awhole.  It  incorporates  Plan  I,  and adds  certain  other foodstuffs sufficient toprovide supplies for varying periods.     In addition, the wheat reserve would supply about 28,000 tons of wheat offals.     18.  Plan III adds another three months&apos; supply of wheat to Plan II, makingsix months&apos; in all, and in  addition provides three months&apos;  cereals for animal feeding.     19.  Plan IV goes still further, adding sufficient maize, barley  and oats to plan III to bring reserves of feeding stuffs up to about six months&apos; consumption.     20.  The Sub-Committee feels that financial considerations would preclude the adoption of Plan IV and perhaps even of Plan III.     21.  The Sub-Committee  recommends  to the  Cabinet  the adoption  inprinciple of Plan II as a first  step in building up reserves of food and feeding-stuffs for livestock. &apos; Legislation will be required and its preparation should beput in hand at once by the Board of Trade.  Further consideration can be givento the rate  at which Plan II, if approved, should be completed, and how it shouldbe completed, i.e., whether the reserve stocks should be purchased outright, shouldbelong to the Government and be housed in whole or in part in Government-owned or leased storage accommodation, and whether members of the trade should be encouraged by an appropriate financial inducement to increase the amount of stocks  which they  normally  hold.     22.  The Sub-Committee regards Plan II  as a guide to and not necessarilyas the last  word in the requirements.  The programme will in any  case take sometime to complete,  and  during  its execution market and other conditions may call  for amendments of various kinds to the original schedule.     23.  Plan II, as it stands, makes no provision for cereals for livestock.   Thisis a question to which further consideration is being given by the Sub-Committeeand  in due course it may have to come  before the Cabinet.
    24.  Other matters which are still under  active consideration by the Sub-Committee include the provision  of  the  fertilisers necessary  to maintain and increase home production of crops as well as the programme for increased homeagricultural production.                                  Secrecy:   -                       .     .    25.  It is important to preserve as much secrecy as is possible in regard to thedetails concerning food reserves.   The first thing which an enemy carrying out an attack on our trade with a view to starving us out would like to know would bethe composition, amount and location of our reserves.  It has long been the policyof the  Service Departments to decline  in the public  interest to  publish any information regarding reserve material and the  Sub-Committee hopes the sameline will be adopted in regard to  food reserves.  Secrecy, moreover,  is important from the point of view of purchase.  Any announcement that the Government was going to establish a reserve of a particular commodity would be bound to cause an appreciable hardening  of the price  against  the  Government, and  consumersgenerally.    On the other hand, it is clearly in the public interest to advertise the factthat reserves of essential  commodities are being accumulated,  provided  that no details are  mentioned which would be  of assistance to our potential enemies.    26.    Summary of the Recommendations of the Sub-Committee.    (1)  That the policy  of  food  storage  should be approved in principle bythe adoption of Plan II at a capital cost not to  exceed  25 million.    (2)  That the President of the Board of Trade should be asked to prepare adraft  Bill enabling the Government to  proceed with a storage policy, the Billto be in sufficiently wide terms to  cover all anticipated requirements.    (3)  That the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence should be  authorisedto make an announcement in the House of Commons at an  early date to the effectthat the Government have decided on a policy of food storage, and that legislation on the subject will  in due course be submitted, the terms of this announcement to be drafted in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the First Lordof the  Admiralty,  the President of the  Board  of Trade, the Secretary of Statefor  Scotland and the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.
