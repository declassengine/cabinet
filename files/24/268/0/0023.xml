                                  PART 1Object of this paper.    THE purpose of this paper is to review current problems and developments in Imperial Defence in a way which will facilitate co-operation by Members ofthe British Commonwealth to such extent as each may desire.   A schedule of thepossible forms which such co-operation might take,  in various contingencies, is annexed to  this report.Outline of  Liabilities.    2.  The continued existence of the British Commonwealth of Nations in theform in which we now know it depends upon the security from attack by  foreign powers of  each Member  of the Commonwealth and of the main communications between them.   Neither  aggression nor expansion  forms  any part  in  british policy, and, consequently, security is only likely  to be  threatened  through  anexpansionist policy on the part of some other Power.    3.  The problem of  organising Imperial defence is in  any case  an immenseone, and  in order to keep  it within practicable  proportions  our liabilitiesshould be limited  to the defence  of those interests which at the same time arevital  to the continued existence of the British  Commonwealth of Nations andappear, in  the light of our knowledge  of the policies of foreign  Powers,  to be liable to attack.    4.  In their Annual Review* which was  put before  the Dominion PrimeMinisters in 1935 the Chiefs of Staff repeated the conclusion reached in 1933 thatthe three liabilities of major importance remained         The Defence of possessions and interests  in the&quot;Far East;        European commitments;  and        The Defence of India against  Soviet aggression.Events since 1935 affecting  our defence liabilities.    5.  Since that date events have occurred which ai;e likely to have far-reachingeffects upon Imperial defence problems.  Of these  the most important is  German&apos;rearmament.  The only Treaty limitation to which this rearmament is at presentsubjected is the Anglo-German Agreement of  1935 fixing the German  fleet at35 per cent, of the Naval Forces  of the British Commonwealth of Nations.  Weare not here concerned with the causes leading up  to Germany&apos;s rearmament, butwe must stress the fact that since 1935 its intensive  character and vast extent havedominated  the  European  situation.   The reoccupation  by  Germany  of theDemilitarized Zone has increased the practicability of a sudden attack on Franceand Belgium if Germany were to  decide to make such an  attack, and, at the sametime, has rendered it more difficult for France to launch an offensive to assist her allies  if they are attacked by Germany.  These  developments have created a feeling of  uncertainty and alarm throughout Europe.     International relations have been further embittered by the  propaganda campaign launched by Hitler in 1936, with a view  to forming an anti-Communistbloc in Europe, of which  he would be the leader.    His Majesty&apos;s Government have  been active throughout the  year  in attempting to replace the Locarno Treaty, which  was torn up by Germany last march, by a  new mutual  guarantee treaty  between the five  Western  Powers.Meanwhile, pending  a  Five-Power Treaty,  the French and  United kingdom governments have made  declarations undertaking to guarantee each other againstunprovoked attack and a similar  declaration has been made to Belgium.    Previous to this France  had  tried to strengthen herself by concluding amutual guarantee Pact with the Soviet Government.  The military value of thisPact is a matter of considerable  doubt, but it is in  French eyes chiefly of  value as an  insurance  policy against  an  eventual  Soviet-German rapprochement.Germany strongly resents this Pact a, circumstance which  has  allegedly  ham-hampered all recent negotiations  between Germany and the Western Powers  for apolitical understanding.   In these circumstances there is little likelihood of the         * Paper No. C.O.S. 872 (also C.I.D. Paper No. 1181-B).[14201]
conclusion of the Five-Power Agreement and the close  reciprocal relationship which has recently grown up between Rome and Berlin is of great significance.     6.  The Italian conquest of Abyssinia in defiance of the League has been a severe blow to the authority of that institution, and has also had the effect of driving France and Italy once more apart, and bringing Italy and Germany, atany  rate  temporarily, together.  Its effects on Anglo-Italian relations showedthemselves particularly in strained relations in the Mediterranean.  Italy began to cherish ideas of dominating the Mediterranean, and establishing a predominantposition in the Near East to the detriment of British interests.   More recently,however,  Italy has shown signs of wishing once more to restore Anglo-italian relations in the Mediterranean to their previously friendly state.  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment responded to the advance, and the result has been the Anglo-ItalianDeclaration of the 2nd January  and the Exchange of  Notes of the 31st December.Events will show how far this reconciliation is sincere on the part of Italy.  Inany  case we must face the fact that, whether Italy is friendly or the reverse, the days are past when we could count automatically on a friendly and submissiveItaly.   From henceforward  we will have to look to a  rival, though circumstances may periodically make it necessary for her to put her rivalry into the background.     7.  The intervention of other European Powers in the Spanish civil war hasfurther embittered  international  relations.    In  dealing  with  the Spanishsituation  His Majesty&apos;s  Government are  vitally concerned in two  matters (a) to prevent the civil war from developing into  a European war, and  (&amp;) tomaintain  the territorial integrity of  Spain.  At the  same time, it is not to our interest to see a Communist Government established  in Spain under the controlof the U.S.S.R., nor would it be  to our interest if a Fascist Spanish Governmentwere established under the protection and guidance of Berlin and Rome.     8.  The negotiation of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty has introduced modifica-tions in the military position of the United Kingdom in Egypt and the Sudan,the developments  from which cannot yet be fully foreseen.     9.  In the Far  East, the continued  strained relations between China and japan must constitute a  risk to Empire  interests in that area.   Moreover, theagreement between Germany and Japan which was reached in 1936 may prove tohave increased the risk of our being involved in war simultaneously in Europe andin the Far East.  On the other hand, increase of  Soviet strength in the far east may act as a check on Japanese activities, though it may deflect them furthersouthward, when  they would come into more direct conflict with our interests.     10.  The  decline in the prestige of  the  League  since  1935 has  had acertain  indirect  influence on the  security  of  the  United  Kingdom and  itscommunications.   In the early  post-war  years  Germany was unorganised anddisarmed,  Italy  was weak  and submissive, Russia  was in chaos, and  therewas  no reason to  anticipate any immediate threat from Japan.  These were thereal  reasons why Ave were able to effect such extensive reductions  in our arma-ments, and not the existence of the League Covenant.   So long as such conditionscontinued, it was possible to assume that  the system  of collective security would,in case of need, procure for us the co-operation of other Powers; but security rests on the military strength which is actually put into the field,  and, ultimately,therefore  on the will to war of  the people. It is essentially a practical matter.The  events of the past few years have shown that in  the presence of the highly-armed and unscrupulous States  with which we have  to deal to-day, Members ofthe League cannot be relied upon  to take collective  military action against  an aggressor  State when such action  conflicts with their interests or even when  no interest of theirs is vitally  affected.  We must,  therefore, base our appreciation of the military implications of  the political situation in the  world to-day uponfacts and reasoned  probabilities rather  than  upon  the  assumption that other powers will act more altruistically in the future than in the past.Summary of liabilities.     11.   The developments  of  the  past  two years   have given to Our already existing liabilities in the Mediterranean  an increased  importance, while  suchchange as  has taken place in  relations with the U.S.S.R. constitutes no justification for eliminating dangers on  the  North-West Frontier of India.  These develop-
merits have also tended to aggravate the United Kingdom&apos;s liabilities in europe in face of Germany and her demand for expansion, and liabilities of the empire in the Far East in face of Japan and her growing power for mischief.    In fact, the situation as it now exists requires that, in order to provide for security, the armed  strength available for  the  defence of  the Empire must beincreased to a  considerably greater degree than  was thought  necessary  evenin 1935.Vital Threats to the Commonwealth.    12.  The threat in Western Europe would be to the United Kingdom herself.Her defeat would destroy the whole structure of the Commonwealth, which in itspresent state of development could not long exist without the political, financialand military strength of the United  Kingdom.  Each Member of the BritishCommonwealth would be left to fend  for itself in its future relations with the victorious foreign Powers.    13.  A German  victory over France, or  to a lesser extent the  permanentoccupation of the Low Countries, would lead to a situation from which a  mostserious threat to the United Kingdom could develop.  For this reason we regard it as an essential interest of the United Kingdom to  do everything in its powerto support France and the Low Countries against German aggression.    14.  In the Far East the  security of  Australia, New Zealand  and Indiahinges on the  retention of Singapore as a base for the British Fleet.    15.  The Eastern Mediterranean is a focal point  in Empire communications.The importance of  our  sea  communications through  the  Mediterranean is wellknown.   The importance of the area in relation  to air communications is rapidlydeveloping.  Without our  possessions and  influence there we should lose thepower  to  exploit the increasing range of  aircraft and  so  develop Empire air routes independently  of foreign nations.    16.  The  security of  India, a vital  link  in Empire communications, is obviously essential for the maintenance of the Commonwealth.          PART II.- REVIEW OF FACTORS WHICH MAY LEAD TO WAR.    17.   In the following paragraphs,  after summarising our conclusions as tothe danger  of  a general conflict in Europe,  we examine the situation in thecountries mentioned above with a view to  ascertaining  to  what  extent we are justified in assuming  that their existing policies are likely to result in a clash of interests between us in the future. Before doing so we wish to restate our generalImperial Defence risks at the moment :       (i) The chief clanger which Imperial Defence has to face at the moment is           that we are in the  position of  having threats  at both ends of the           Empire from strong military Powers, Lei.,  Germany and Japan, while           in the centre we have lost our traditional security in the Mediterranean           owing to  the rise of an aggressive spirit in Italy accompanied by  an           increase in her military strength.  So long as that position remains           unresolved diplomatically,  only  very great  military  and  financial           strength can give the Empire security.     (ii)  Although, as we point out in Paragraph 10, collective  security  is  no          longer a reliable  factor, we  may still  be bound  through the League to&apos;          assume  responsibilities in  connection  with it notwithstanding  the          failure  of other  Powers to play  their  part.   Collective security          through  the League, therefore, greatly increases our  Imperial risks,          and from  a purely military standpoint  is a serious  disadvantage to           an Empire that has  so many vulnerable points.    (hi)  The commitments of France (with whose future our European strategical           position is closely linked) with Russia, and the Little Entente and           Poland, involve great probability that in any struggle in the east or           south-east of  Europe she will become involved.   If France becomes          involved by a decision in  which we should  have no part we, owing to          our  geographical and strategical position, are  in danger of being-          drawn into a general European  war, even though at the moment it          might be highly dangerous for us.
    (iv) For the next three years, when we are re-equipping and re-organising           our forces, our relative strength vis-a-vis  Germany and Japan will not           be increased,  and  during   that  period we  should be  seriously           handicapped if forced into war, either in the west or in the east.     (v) On the other hand, there is one important factor to offset against the           above-stated  risks, i.e.,  the  35 per cent, ratio voluntarily  imposed           on herself by Germany in the Anglo-German Naval Agreement.  If           the rebuilding of the German Navy  was proceeding at its  present           rapid  rate  to unknown  limits  of strength, our Imperial  defence           position would be far more serious.  The importance, therefore, of           holding Germany to that voluntary  limitation and  giving  her no           sufficient reason  to abandon it is obvious.    We assume that conflict with  any of the Powers  we have  mentioned will never occur as  the result of aggression on our part, but  would be a probablecorollary to any attempt on  their part to expand  their own Empires or interests at our expense.Dangers of a General European Conflict.    18.   Generally speaking, it may be  said that  in Europe the danger of ageneral conflict has been increased by the intensive rearmament of  Germany, Italyand the U.S.S.E.; by the increasing sense of insecurity created by Germany&apos;sreoccupation of  the Rhineland;  and  by her  declared  policy  of expansion,accompanied as it is by the deterioration of her internal  economic  situation.  the complications of the Spanish civil war are yet another source of danger,  since itis over this question that the i&apos;ecent tendency of European Powers to reassumethe groupings,  which were  a feature of pre-war  Europe, has  shown signs ofcrystallising in the form of two blocs representing rival  political theories.Germany.    19.   Germany&apos;s foreign policy  aims at the inclusion in the Reich of all german  peoples  and  the  acquisition  of  new  territory  for  her expandingpopulation.  It seeks to  acquire new sources of food-stuffs and raw materials andan outlet  for German manufactures, particularly in Eastern Europe, with theobject of making Germany economically as little dependent as possible on foreigncountries, and of raising the standard of living of  the  German people.  At thesame time she has assumed the lead in forming an anti-Communist bloc in Europe.    With expansion eastwards in her mind it is  doubtful whether Germany hasany real wish to enter  into any treaty of mutual  guarantees between the fiveWestern Powers unless  it is constructed in such a  form as to leave her free to pursue a policy of expansion in Eastern and  Central Europe, which, in conjunc-tion with her antagonism to Communism, cleaidv  tends to  lead Germany into3onflict with the IJ.S.S.R.    As  a  further consequence her  relations with  Czechoslovakia, which has a defensive  arrangement with the Soviet Government, have  become strained, andthe suspicion has arisen  that Germany&apos;s plans for expansion may take the formof an attempt to destroy Czechoslovakia, either by a process of disintegration orby direct attack.    20.   Strategically, the future of the United Kingdom, and with it the futureof the British Empire, is closely linked with that of  France.  If Germany crushedFrance  she would  dominate all  Western  Europe  and  would gain power and position which would subsequently render the situation immensely  difficult forthe United Kingdom.    British military interest in central  or eastern Europe is only  indirect, but in whatever part of Europe war might start, there would be grave risk that it wouldspread to involve other Powers.    If, for example, Germany were to develop an expansionist policy Eastwards,.she might, as matters now are, be opposed by both France and Russia under theirTreaty obligations.  Thus, the war would have spread to Western Europe, and we might become involved.   Alternatively,  if France  and Russia were to fail to implement their Treaty obligations,  they would lose  prestige.  And, France in theWest being isolated, might turn to us for more positive assistance,  as for instance.in the shape of an alliance  with consequences which are difficult to foresee andare in any case beyond the scope of this Review.
    Apart from these considerations, if war should break out  in  Central orEastern Europe, our  policy must be dictated by our interests.   In any case, itwould obviously be of the highest importance to prevent the extension of the war to Western Europe, where a vital British interest would be involved.    21   Although at the moment it is possible, though by no means certain, thatGermany  has  renounced all intention  of expansion westward,  the French pactswith the U.S.S.R., Poland and Czechoslovakia keep alive the danger that, in theevent of an act of aggression by Germany in Eastern or Central Europe, Francemay become involved  on behalf of her Eastern allies, thus extending the war to western Europe.  The possibility of  Germany achieving  her aims at  territorialexpansion in Europe,  as a result of peaceful changes, lies outside the scope of thisreport, but we are bound to say that we feel considerable doubt as to this provingpracticable.    22.   The  German Government have recently taken  under their aegis  and pressed forward the  campaign which  has been going on for some time for thereturn of the  German colonies.   This campaign, ostensibly for the satisfaction of her rights to expansion, her need for raw materials, and for free markets forher manufactures, is probably in reality to enhance her prestige, and also to unitethe nation in  the conviction that Germany&apos;s difficulties are due to external  andnot to internal difficulties.   This latter reason may be regarded as the most seriouspotential  source of enmity  against the United Kingdom, and  the demand for colonies is likely to become more insistent as German military strength increases.The return of any ex-Colonies to Germany would, of course, raise new problems and commitments in  Imperial  Defence.  Strategic considerations, however, arenot alone involved; nor,  in general,  are  they the  most important, with  theexception perhaps of those  that arise in the case of Tanganyika.  The loss of tanganyika would  mean, the severance of the &quot; all  red &quot; air route from  Cairoto the Cape and render impossible the movement of air  forces between Northand South Africa without flying over  foreign territory.    23.   Germany aims at achieving a dominant position in Europe based on her military strength. Thanks to the efficiency with which plans have matured overa period of j^ears to prepare the nation&apos;s industries for  the mass production ofarmaments,  Germany has in  the short time since the advent  of the national socialist Government created  an Air  Force  superior  to that of  France or  Italy.She has  also  increased  the  strength,  of   her  army  from ten divisions  in1933 to thirty-six infantry divisions and three armoured divisions, which may betaken  as  fully  equipped  to-day.  Should  the present  rate  of  expansion  bemaintained Germany  would by 1940 probably be able to mobilise a larger numberof divisions than she mobilised in  1914.  By the end of  1942 her Navy will be equal in strength to 35 per cent, of the Naval Forces of the British Commonwealthof Nations.  Although this entirely new and well-balanced force is still in processof development, it is already sufficient to assure command in the Baltic.    Concurrently with the citation of these large forces  and  the accumulation of vast war stores,  Germany is doing  everything possible  to prepare the nation to withstand the strain of a prolonged war of national effort, should an attempt.to gain an early favourable decision, at, which she would probably aim,  fail.  Herendeavours to render the  country independent  of foreign  supplies  of raw-materials, officially justified on the  grounds  of economic necessity, are in fact atleast as much inspired by this military policy.  So  far  as straitened, financial resources  will  allow, reserves are being built up of those strategic raw materials for which substitutes cannot be produced  at home.  The whole  force of  Statepropaganda is at work cultivating  a unified  national spirit.    24.   The  dangers to Germany herself and to her neighbours arising from her economic  policy spring  from the artificial  interdependence created between herarmaments and her economic welfare.   In order to effect her intensive rearmamentGermany has  had to  put a strain on her economic system,  which has resulted insuch hardships and restrictions as are usually associated only with a state of war.The fear that this economic strain cannot  continue indefinitely without somecatastrophe has further added to the general feeling of insecurity and has checkedthe international economic revival  which might  otherwise have been expected.If a serious rise in unemployment  is to be  avoided,  armament expenditure  canbe reduced only by substituting some  other form of industrial activity;  but this
again must  entail huge capital expenditure.   Foreign trade  will be still more restricted by the recent depreciation of foreign currencies and a programme offurther State expenditure will be as difficult to finance as will be the importationof the raw materials necessary  to carry it out.    Thus, by the very momentum of their own achievements in rearmament, theGerman Government may find themselves impelled into some foreign adventure todistract attention  from &quot;domestic difficulties.  The  strength of Herr  Hitler  lies in the confidence he has instilled into the  German people and the ease with whichhe can carry his decisions into  effect.  He cannot, however, risk loss of prestigeas a result of a set-back and he must continue to produce new successes in order tokeep the support of the people./ apart.    25.  Japan is aiming at  hegemony in the East, just as Germany  is inEurope.   She  will have  difficulty in  supporting  much  longer  her  rapidly increasing population and is, moreover, singularly deficient in those raw materialsnecessary for industrial  development along modern lines.   Intense  competition in foreign trade enhanced by the cheapness of Japanese labour has been counteredin parts of the British Empire  and other countries by various measures designedto limit an  expansion of Japanese exports.   This  reduces Japan&apos;s power topurchase the raw materials on  which her essential manufactures depend.    The solution of this problem  is the  principal objective of Japanese policy,which is largely,  perhaps mainly,  influenced by the wishes of the armed forces.The solution favoured is  the creation of a more self-sufficient empire and theparamountcy of Japan in the Far East.    Although the  armed  forces  of Japan  are agreed on  the  necessity  for expansion, there is a division  of opinion on  the direction  this expansion shall take.   The  Army  advocates  expansion   westwards  and  southwards  fromManchuria.   The  navy  counts on  more southerly  parts of  China for  rawmaterials and  hopes to  extend Japanese influence  in  Siam, with  its rubberpotentialities, and Borneo, with its  supplies of petroleum,  and thus to  acquire the general control of the Western Pacific Ocean.    The collective interests  of the  members  of  the  British Commonwealth ofNations in China, excluding  Manchukuo, in trade  and finance are greater thanthose of any other country.  The potential market in China is so vast that it is bound to provoke the keenest  competition.    Japan&apos;s  further expansion into Mongolia will  not bring her into directconflict with us; but penetration into Central and South China and her economic policy in the Western Pacific impinge directly on British  interests.   Success inthis policy tends to infringe British and American  trading  rights in the far east, with an accompanying loss of prestige  throughout Asia, which in turn mustfurther reduce the trade of Empire countries.    Japanese economic penetration of the Philippines is already formidable  andis likely to have further increased by 1945, by which date the United States have announced their intention of granting independence  to the Philippines.  Untilthat date, however, the United  States of America may be expected to resist  anyattempt at annexation by Japan, though her  subsequent attitude cannot yet bedetermined.    If Japanese influence were  to dominate the Philippines, Siam or Indo-China,.a serious reduction in the volume of  Empire trade in  the Far East would result.    26.  The southward  movement  would  not menace the security  of  british india,  Australia  or New  Zealand unless it gave the Japanese  control of  baseswhich would facilitate offensive operations against Singapore.    The retention of Hong Kong as  a  British possession would be threatened atthe outset.  The  integrity of the Netherlands East  Indies is a major  british interests which has been recognised by the  Committee of Imperial Defence.*    To a lesser extent, it is important that the Philippines, Siam and Indo-China should remain in the occupation of a friendly Power.    27.  The international settlements at Amoy and  Shanghai and the peculiar.international situation in the Tientsin area must be regarded as containing theseeds of trouble between  Japan and  the United Kingdom which may develop inan acute form,  though in the absence of extraneous reasons it  is hardly likely to-* C.I.D. Paper No. 1245-B.
reach the proportions of a major issue.  In the event, however, of a Sino-Japaneseconflict the position of British nationals in China must cause  us grave concern.    28.  Japanese  military aggression  is liable to force her  into hostilities withtheU.S.S.R.    In any action Japan may take she will be influenced by the attitude of theUnited States with whom her relations  have for some years lacked cordiality.    There is little  doubt that Japan would seize the opportunity afforded by a european war, in which we are involved, to further her expansionist schemes inthe Far East.   Even if the British Empire were not immediately involved in the conflict, the effect on British strength in the Far East  would not be underratedby the Japanese.    Japan may be  expected to take  advantage of any event  which will give hera free  hand, and events in 1931 point to the possibility  that even a recurrence ofBritish economic depression might give  Japan the occasion she desires.    The recent understanding between Japan  and Germany has been concludedostensibly as a safeguard against communism, but may increase the chances ofhostilities between Japan and the United Kingdom.    If the strength of the Soviet forces in the Far East is increased, Japan mightbe deterred from such further expansion in North-West China as might  resultin hostilities with the U.S.S.R.   Consequently, there is the possibility of Japanturning towards expansion in  a southern direction, to which  reference was madein paragraph 25 above.   From the military aspect, therefore, we warmly supportthe efforts of our diplomacy to adjust the differences between Japan and ourselves,to which such  a, change of direction of Japanese policy  might give rise.  Anagreement with Japan would enormously  strengthen  the  Empire  but  at thepresent time the probability of the  conclusion of such an agreement is remote.Italy.    29.  The effects on  Anglo-Italian  relations  of the League action taken in1935-36 have already been referred to.   The immediate effect of the Abyssinianwar has been to render  Italy in some respects more vulnerable than before.  by establishing an &quot; empire&quot;  on  the far  side of the Suez Canal she has given ahostage to fortune  and this increases her nervousness as regards future british policy  in  the Mediterranean and the Red Sea.   The  development  of  this new-empire will take time and cost a great deal of money, and meanwhile her economicand financial position has been severely shaken by the strain of the war, and showspromise of continued deterioration.   This again has temporarily increased hervulnerability.   She has endeavoured  to  strengthen herself by  establishing  close relations with Germany,  but their co-operation is affected at  all times by mutualdistrust as regards affairs in Central Europe.  The United  Kingdom and Italyeach has the  power to threaten communications essential to  the other and Italy has, probably mainly on this  account,  shown increasing anxiety to  restore her relations with Great Britain to normal.  It has been the policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to respond  to  these  Italian advances  so  long  as  no liabilities &quot;orconcessions were required from the United Kingdom,  and  the result has  beenthe recent Anglo-Italian declaration regarding British and  Italian interests inthe Mediterranean.  It is hoped that the more friendly atmosphere created bythis declaration will bring about a certain degree of co-operation between Italyand the United Kingdom, not only  in  the Mediterranean but elsewhere.   It isstill too  early to be able to judge how far these expectations are likely to be fulfilled.  What, however, is fairly  clear is that, in the present circumstances,Italy  realises the danger of being on bad terms with the United Kingdom, andis probably impressed  by British determination  to rearm.   Italy probably alsodislikes  being, so  to  speak,  left alone with  Germany  with no  alternativefriendship to fall back on.    30.  It must always be remembered that, among the great Powers,  Italy isparticularly vulnerable both from the naval and economic point of view, and thatthis fact compels her to be  constantly adapting  her foreign policy  to changing circumstances.  This makes her policy one of opportunism.  There is no reason to suppose that her policy will have any greater consistency in the future than in thepast.   On the other hand, it is likely that, so long as the  Fascist regime continues,it will, whenever circumstances are&quot; favourable, show itself more adventurous and       T14201]                                                      c
more aggressive than in the past.  Up till last year  the only matter in whichItalian policy had shown any consistency was with regard to the United Kingdom,with whom she had steadily maintained friendly  relations over  a large numberof years.   It would be unwise, however, to count now on the continuance of this state of affairs, even though friendly relations have been restored as a result ofthe recent Anglo-Italian declaration.  The Fascist regime has given modern Italynew ambitions in the realm of foreign affairs, and although  she may be  prudentenough to disguise  these in certain circumstances,  the fact remains that  the very special position occupied  by the United Kingdom in the Mediterranean and inthe Near  East may alwajrs lead to a, clash between the two countries  if  Italyattempts to embark upon a policy of expansion.  The temporary establishment of italian influence in the Balearic Islands  and Italian propaganda in the Arabianlittoral of the  Red Sea, especially the latter, suggest directions in which thispolicy  may clash with British interests, while the presence of strong Italianmilitary forces in Abyssinia, which has common frontiers with British territory,has introduced a further risk.  We cannot overlook the possibility of the  Italianstraining large numbers of natives  in Abyssinia, which would have a very seriousaspect  from the point of view of our African Colonies as well as of the Union ofSouth  Africa.  Better relations with Italy should be  our constant  aim, but wecannot look forward to a state of things where identity of interest and mutual confidence  between. the United Kingdom and Italy can be  relied upon in theMediterranean in anything like the same way that  these two factors can be relied upon in regard to  military and naval problems common to ourselves and the French.    We must recognise the possibility that on any  occasion when British military resources were  pre-occupied in a dispute with another Power Italy might takeadvantage of the  opportunity  to attempt to further her own ends at our expense.U.S.S.R.    31.  Until some six years ago the policy  of the Soviet Government  was oneof open hostility  to the political system  established in  Europe by the Treaty ofVersailles and its corollaries,  and  to His Majesty&apos;s Government  and the FrenchGovernment in particular, both as the chief authors of that system and as theGovernments of  the two  leading  capitalist countries  (apart  from  the UnitedStates, which they had special reasons for not antagonising), and, in their  view,the chief  bulwarks against world revolution.  On the other hand,  they stroveto enter into close relations with the Governments of States dissatisfied with that system, such as Germany  and Italy.  Since 1931,  however, and especially in thepast two years, the  Soviet Government have felt themselves threatened from both germany and Japan, and their attitude  towards His Majesty&apos;s Government has improved pari passu with the deterioration of their relations  with the  Germanand Japanese Governments.  Indeed, it may be predicted that  so long as theyfear German or  Japanese aggression and recognise the existence of a similarpreoccupation on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government, their policy towards thelatter will remain friendly in the purely political sense.  They will also ostensiblyco-operate with His Majesty&apos;s Government  in the maintenance of peace.   Butwhereas it is contrary to the interests of His Majesty&apos;s  Government that  thereshould be  war anywhere,  the Soviet Government would have no fundamentalobjection to a war between the capitalist Powers of  Europe, so long as the U.S.S.R.were not involved.  Moreover, in certain circumstances  she might hope that sucha  war  would give  an  opportunity to Communism to establish itself in Europegenerally.   In fact, there is no reason to suppose that they  have abandoned theultimate hope of  world revolution, and, if at any time the German and Japanesemenace were removed, they might  well revert to their previous  policy of  hostility to the British  Empire.  Hence the defence of India  against  Soviet aggressionremains  a liability to be taken into account on a long view of defence policy,though it need not  be envisaged in the near future.     32.   Meanwhile,  the military development of the Soviet Union has beenpushed on with great rapidity.  She now possesses the largest army and air forcein the world, and  her submarine  forces may have reached  similar  dimensions;her  military position in the Far East has  been immensely  strengthened andintensive  efforts  are being made  to put  the country  into  a  state  of  defence,economically and militarily.   Thus, the strength of  the army  has risen  from82 divisions in 1931 to 108 divisions at the present time; and it is calculated thatthe Soviet Union may now be in a position to put at least 75 divisions into the field
on her Western front within one month of mobilisation.  By 1940 this last figuremay have risen to 120.  In fact, in defence, the Soviet army is already a powerto be reckoned with; in attack it would probably  be  less  effective.   Up to thepresent Soviet naval forces have been primarily intended for coast defence, buta considerable building programme is now, apparently, to be embarked upon.  Thepresent first line strength of the Soviet Air Force is about 3,500  aircraft, but itis unlikely that this number  will be materially increased in the near future.Not  more&apos; than 2,000 of these aircraft could, however, be made available forimmediate operations on her Western front.     33.  Soviet  policy in Europe  is  now  partly  inspired by  the  fear  ofGerman aggression.   It was  for this purpose that pacts  were concluded  with france and  Czechoslovakia, and mainly for this purpose that the Soviet Unionjoined the League of Nations.  The Soviet position would obviously be greatly strengthened if  they  could  induce His  Majesty&apos;s Government to  pronouncethemelves in favour of the defence of the status quo in every part of Europe.  TheSoviet  Government,  therefore,  welcome  every  indication  of  Anglo-Frenchsolidarity against Germany. For the next few years, at least, the British Empireand the Soviet Union are likely to have two common potential enemies in Germanyand  Japan, as well as a common desire for  peace (though for different reasons ineach case).   In the  economic  sphere,  there is at present  no likelihood of realfriction, since the natural resources of the Soviet Union are, or will shortly be,adequate for nearly  all its needs,  while her  development has not yet reached a stage where the export surplus seriously threatens any British trade.   british policy towards Asiatic countries such as Turkey, Persia, Afghanistan and China,is likely to remain unobjectionable to the  Soviet Union so long as the generalworld situation remains what it now is; and although developments in the Spanishsituation might give rise to a certain amount of friction, it seems unlikely thatAnglo-Soviet relations will be  seriously disturbed from that cause.  Finally,  if an outbreak of war  in  Europe  involves a German attack  on France or  the  low countries, this country and France might, through the operation of their presentobligations, find themselves both fighting with the Soviets  against Germany.  Itis outside our province to  comment upon the ultimate political consequences ofsuch co-operation.     34.  In  the  Far East the situation is somewhat similar,  but  the Sovietposition is stronger.  There the Soviet military  preparations are rapidly being completed, and include the location of a large force  of long-distance bombing-aircraft in the Maritime Province, which constitutes a serious threat to  Japan.The Soviet submarine forces in the Far East, moreover, are  a factor which cannotbe disregarded.  Consequently, in the event of war  between the United Kingdomand  Japan, the assistance of the U.S.S.R. might be of considerable value.             PART III. RE-ARMAMENT IN THE UNITED  KINGDOM.     35.  The developments   which  have  taken  place  in  Europe,  since there-armament  of  Germany led the Government of  the  United  Kingdom  tointroduce a re-armament programme which has  been  expanded and acceleratedso far as is compatible with the minimum  interference of  the normal industrialactivities of  the  country.  The main features of the  programme were outlinediu the  Chiefs of  Staff review in 1935 and are therefore  well  known  to theDominion Prime Ministers, but we summarise our broad policy below.     36.  To be effective, re-armament must be accompanied by the developmentof a system under which the whole of our available man-power can be economicallyutilised in war, and  the whole of our industrial resources rapidly adapted to war production.  In both these aspects of preparation for war,  democracies sufferlimitations which are over-ridden in totalitarian States.  The latter impose  upon their people in time of peace many of the conditions associated wuth time of war,so that preparation for war can be  carried  out to the  exclusion  of other considerations.  The rearmament  of  the United Kingdom is being carried outwith the minimum of interference with peace-time industry and pari passu withconstant requests for supply from the Dominions and Colonies, and from foreigncountries.  There are some foreign countries, such as Belgium and Turkey, which.we have to supply for reasons  of policy, and others, such as  Egypt and Iraq,  with       [14201]                                                    c 2
 whom we have treaty obligations for the supply of warlike stores.  Consequently, while the man-power and industry of the totalitarian States are already on a war footing, the rearmament and re-organisation of the forces of the United Kingdom are subject to severe industrial and man-power limitations. Naval Strength.     37.   in  1925 we adopted a one-power standard,  which only required that our  fleet, wherever  situated,  should be  equal  to the fleet of any other  nation, wherever situated.  At  that time European navies, except our own,  were in a state of decline,  and it  was possible to accept a standard which took no direct account of their  strength,  but merely  assumed that the margin we  should have over  Japan on the 5:5:3  ratio would be sufficient to meet our needs in home waters.     38.   The rebuilding of the French  and Italian navies, unhampered by the London Naval Treaty, led to the proposal in 1932 of a safer naval standard, viz., that  we should be able  to retain in European waters  a &apos;&apos; deterrent  force &apos;&apos;  to prevent our vital home terminal areas being commanded by the strongest European naval power, while we took up a defensive position in the Far East and brought home the necessary units for home defence.     39.   During our investigation of  naval strength, we recognised the  danger even  of the 1932 standard,  owing to the fact that the process of disengaging our forces in the  East and  bringing them home might take so long  as to lead  to disaster.  Alternatively, if we were engaged in a European war, a large portion of the Empire might be left at the mercy of an aggressor.  An important factor arising since  1932 is the  rebuilding  of the  German  Navy, now in  progress, though fortunately its strength  is limited by the Anglo-German Agreement  of 1935  to 35 per cent, of the naval forces of the British Commonwealth of Nations. The   following  standard   of  naval  strength  has  been  put  forward forconsideration :     &quot;  (i) To enable us to place a fleet  in the Far East  fully adequate to act  on           the defensive, and to  serve as a strong deterrent against any threat  to           our interests in that part of the globe;    (ii) To maintain in all circumstances in home waters a force able to meet           the requirements of a Avar with Germany at the same time. Included in (i) and (ii)  would be the forces necessary in all parts of the world,behind the cover of the main fleets,  to protect our territories and merchant shipsagainst sporadic  attacks.&quot;   Up  to now no consideration has been given to thequestion of implementing the  above policy, as the British Commonwealth navalprogrammes have been limited by treaty until the end of 1936.A rmy Strength.    40.  No expansion  of the Army on a  scale comparable to the expansion  of the Royal Air Force or the additions  to the Royal Navy  is contemplated.  TheRegular Army is  being  maintained at the strength necessary for its  duties  ingarrisoning and policing overseas British possessions.   The re-equipment andre-organisation of the units thus necessarily maintained in the United kingdom to make them into an efficient Field Force of one mechanised division and fourother divisions of regular troops, ready to operate at short notice in any part  of the world, is being undertaken.   This  will leave  a fifth regular division whichis not included in the Field Force available as a reserve for employment where  itis most needed.  In addition, there are twelve divisions of the Territorial Armyand  under a  recent  decision provision  is to be  made  for  sufficient modern equipment for training purposes.    41.  For the  Air Defence  of Great Britain certain Territorial Army forma-tions  are being re-organised as anti-aircraft batteries and  searchlight companies. The present programmes, which  are limited only by productive capacity, aim  atcompletion during 1939.  Recruiting for the Army presents a serious problem  inaddition to that of re-equipment and  re-organisation.  Recruits are not being obtained in adequate numbers either for  the Regular  Army or the  TerritorialArmy, although recently there has been  an improvement as  regards the  latter.
Air strength.    42.  In spite of various attempts during the Disarmament Conferences toarrive at a formula for the limitation of air power no agreement could be reached on this subject at Geneva.  Nor has any practical result emerged from the various proposals for an Air Pact to cover the danger of sudden air attack.    In these circumstances, and since it is  indisputable that Great Britain isexceptionally vulnerable to air attack, we have been  forced  to  accelerate  our preparations against this particular danger. -    43.  The present expansion programme  for the Royal Air Force is no easyproblem, for, so far as the United  Kingdom is concerned, it must be recognisedthat the small  industrial capacity of our  aircraft firms and  the  economicalpersonnel policy which  the Royal Air  Force was  forced to  adopt under  the&quot; ten-year  rule &quot; both tend to limit the rate of expansion so long as we adhere to normal methods of procedure.PART IV. REVIEW OF THE STRATEGICAL POSITION IN RELATION TO EACH MAJOR                                 LIABILITY.    44.  In the following sections  we  review the chief strategical factors likelyto affect the outcome of conflicts in  which  British forces are liable to be involvedin defence of vital British interests.    We will first review the strategic position vis-a-vis Germany, Japan, Italyand the U.S.S.R. individually because the issues at stake and the salient features of the situation can be most clearly represented in this way.    The chances that a war in  which the United Kingdom became involved with one Power could be prevented from  spreading to other Powers are,  however, smalland we cannot feel confident that, if war comes, the  liability will be limited to asingle opponent.   We will, therefore, also refer to some of the main issues withwhich we might be faced in opposing a combination of Powers.War against Germany.    45.  If within the next few years the United Kingdom should be forced into war against Germany, we should probably be in alliance with France and possiblyBelgium, although the chance  that Belgium  might  remain neutral has been&apos;increased by recent announcements  of her policy.   We cannot foretell what theattitude of France&apos;s allies in Eastern Europe, the U.S.S.R., Poland and  Czecho-slovakia, would  be, though it  might  well exercise an  important influence inGermany&apos;s decision.  We should find Germany&apos;s war  preparations considerably more  advanced  than our own  or  those  of our allies,  and  it is  probable thatGermany would  try to exploit her preparedness to give her a rapid victory- which she would hope to realise within a  few months.   The allies, on the otherhand,  would have no means of winning  quickly; they  would, have to rely  forultimate victory on economic  and industrial  advantages giving them  a com-manding superiority in  war resources over  Germany, a process  likely  to takeyears rather than months.   The Allies must, therefore, plan  to stave  off firstattacks in the hope that they would obtain the time they require to develop their full  war effort.   Moreover,  the restrictions on the  export of  armaments tobelligerent  nations at present in force in the United  States of America would, if-applied impartially to both sides, be of considerable embarrassment to us and  our allies.  They will, however, be subject either to reaffirmation  in their  present&quot;non-discretionary&quot; form, or to amendment, on the  1st May, 1937.    46.  We consider that Germany&apos;s initial offensive would be concentratedeither against the United Kingdom  or alternatively against France with the hopeof obtaining a rapid success against the selected antagonist.  Against the UnitedKingdom Germany must depend chiefly on air attack, as our  naval superiority is great and her land forces cannot operate against us.    47;  The character of Germany&apos;s war preparations shows that she is aiming at reaching her maximum war potential at the time war is declared, and that the-attacks she could deliver during the first  phase of  the war might therefore bethe most powerful of which she would at any time be capable.   Thev would
certainly be developed with the minimum of delay or warning.  Consequently, theUnited Kingdom, with France and Belgium if they were allied, to her, must needsmeet the whole weight of Germamy&apos;s initial attacks with the resources immediately available at home.  During this first phase the only resources at the disposal ofthe United Kingdom would be those which had been prepared and organised inpeace.  The  aid which Dominions could  render  in this phase, no matter  howanxious they might be to co-operate, would be limited to reinforcements  and supplies maintained in peace, and no action  which they might initiate after theoutbreak of war could materially affect the issue of this first phase.    48.  If  Germany&apos;s initial offensive were concentrated  against  the UnitedKingdom, our air forces, with the co-operation of those of  our allies, would be obliged to make counter attacks to defeat it.   The initial employment of the land forces must be determined by events, but a  use of parts at any rate of these forces to assist in defeating the air attacks and maintaining confidence, law and orderamong our civil population, would probably be necessary.    49.  If Germany&apos;s initial offensive aimed at endeavouring  to knock out ourcontinental allies, our forces would have to give their immediate support in orderto defeat the German attacks.    50.  After  Germany&apos;s initial offensive had been held we should have to beprepared for the war  to enter a second phase  during which our object would be to intensify  the development of our industrial output  especially in aircraft  and munitions, and  to restrict that of Germany.  Our  naval forces, assisted bydiplomatic and commercial  influence upon  neutrals,  would develop  economic pressure upon Germany, which, though  powerful, is slow in operation.    When we had reduced the scale of German  air  attack to a  degTee whichcan be met  by  means  of our defences and  other counter  measures,  our  air striking force should be able to contribute  directly  and  materially  towardsthe economic pressure upon Germany.   The rate at which this pressure  could beincreased would, however, depend upon the extent  to which  our bomber  aircraft could be made available for attack on Germany&apos;s national organisation.    51.  In conjunction with the French  and perhaps the Belgians,  we should endeavour to  maintain  a stabilised  position  until our  resources  enabled us toassume the offensive.Dominion Assistance.    52.  In  this phase, the belligerent who  could maintain and expand  herindustrial output of munitions of till sorts, would  eventually establish a decisiveadvantage over an enemy whose war potential was  less.  Although much has beendone in the direction of organising industry in this country^ for the production ofarmaments in time of war, as indicated in  the Memorandum by the PrincipalSupply Officers  Committee on the Supply of War Material, both in Peace  and war,  it is certain that there would be a large gap  between our requirements  andour capacity, especially in the early stages of a war. Moreover, our arrangements-are liable  to be dislocated to  a considerable extent by  air raids.  Germany, it istrue,  would also be exposed to a similar  disadvantage to the extent that  herfactories lay  within  range of  the  bombing aircraft  of one or  other of  the-belligerents,  which  would be  considerable  in  the  case  of  the   important industries  in the  Ruhr,  Rhine  and  Saar.   Compared,   however,  with  theBritish Empire,  Germany could be placed at  a great disadvantage.  Factories inCanada  and other  Dominions  would  be  immune  from  German  attack and,  if they  had  been developed   before  war  broke  out,  might  prove-a  decisive   factor  in  the  later  phases   of  any  European  war.  This.is   one  direction  in  which  large-scale  co-operation  in   time   of  peace-could,   immensely strengthen the  resources  of the  Empire in time  of war..Indeed, in view  of the embargo by the United States of America referred to inparagraph 45 above,  the availability of additional resources of industrial  and armament supplies might well prove vital.    53.  In considering the  question of  the security of this country  and  the safeguarding of its sea-borne trade against naval attack it is necessary to take-into  account  the  geographical position  of  the   Irish  Free  State.  &quot;  Generalstrategical considerations also show the necessity in the interests of both countries.
1528?of taking adequate measures to prevent the use of Irish Free State territory by-enemy forces as a  basis of hostile operations.  For  this  purpose,  and also  tosecure the protection of the vital trade route concentrated off the Irish coast,the use of the facilities afforded by the Irish Free State harbours would be of thehighest importance.    54.  In other ways also the  ability of the Dominions to assist the UnitedKingdom in defence of the Empire against  a  German attack would depend upon  whether preparations had been made by the Dominions in time of peace.The strain to which the resources of the United Kingdom would be put duringthe first phase would be very intense and we  should inevitably enter the  second phase materially weakened.  The value of reinforcements which reached Europeat that moment from the Dominions would be  far greater than that of reinforce-ments which might arrive six months later.War against Japan.    55.  In a war against Japan our strategical position would  depend uponthe presence of the  British Fleet in Far Eastern waters.   The strength of thefleet that could be sent to the Far East must be governed by consideration of our home  requirements.  In our Annual Review for 1935 we stated that: &quot;although his Majesty&apos;s Government in  the United Kingdom  would never,  we  presume,confide the entire protection of this country and its vital sea communications to aforeign navy in  the  absence of  our Main Fleet, yet if France were our ally, hernaval forces could undertake part of this responsibility.  A British capital ship,cruiser and  destroyer strength  in  home waters equal to that of  Germany  isprobably the least we could accept.&quot;   We re-affirm the above view, which hasbeen confirmed and strengthened in  that part of the  proposed new standard  ofnaval strength which reads :          &quot; To maintain in  all circumstances in home waters a force able to  meet    the  requirements of  a war  with  Germany at  the same time.&quot;  (Vide    paragraph 39.)    56.  As regards our  naval position  vis-a-vis that of Germany, it mustbe  noted that  three of our capital  ships will be  undergoing modernisationuntil  the middle of 1939, and the present state of international affairs is not suchas  to enable us to count on the necessary  notice to make  them available at the outset of hostilities.  Taking this into consideration  with the German strength,we should only be able to send to the Far East a fleet approximately equal to thatof  Japan, in which circumstances our  strategy against  Japan  will probably  inthe initial stages be mainly defensive.    57.   Turning to the possible strategy that Japan might adopt, she will lealisethat the  presence of  the British Fleet in the Far East will be a dominating factor in the strategical situation, and that Singapore is vital to the maintenance of thatfleet.   Japan might, therefore, embark  at  once upon major operations for the capture of Singapore, or with the object of  establishing shore-based air forceswithin striking  range.  She might attempt, at the same time,  to delay our fleetby  sabotage in the  Suez Canal.  In any such operations, however, Japan will always be faced  with the certainty of having to fight a fleet action with us on the arrival of our fleet off  Singapore.   The  defeat of  the  Japanese  Fleet wouldimperil their home country.  To fight our fleet off Singapore, at a great distance from  her own repair bases, Japan would require a considerable superiority.  Thissuperiority  she does not possess.  Hence it appears unlikely that  Japan wouldembark on major operations against Singapore, although in view of the decisiveresults at stake  the possibility of such action can never be definitely excluded.Japan might, hoAvever, carry out raids against Singapore  with the object  ofdamaging the base facilities.    58.  Japan, however, could make herself secure in her own waters, and couldimprove  her position and strike a blow at our prestige by operations designed to capture or neutralize Hong Kong.   Japanese success in these  operations wouldbe  much more probable than in those against Singapore.   In addition to opera-tions  against Hong Kong, we would expect Japan to occupy all potential fleetbases in  China, North and East of Hong Kong, and to make full use of commerce
raiders to attack our trade in the South China Seas, Pacific and Indian Oceans,to cause anxiety and dislocation on certain of our trade routes and force dispersionupon our forces.  To this end Japan might  endeavour to operate naval  forces from temporary bases in Borneo and the Netherlands East Indies, where a numberof suitable positions is available.  Japan might also endeavour to delay the arrival of our fleet, to reduce its heavy ship strength by a process of attrition, e.g., by submarine and minelaying  activities,  and  to  produce  conditions favourable to herself for  a fleet action.     59.  After the arrival of the fleet at Singapore, we should be in a positionto maintain the situation in the Far East as it existed, and prevent  any furtheraggression.  If Hong Kong had fallen, any operations for its recapture  wouldprobably be impossible.   On the other  hand, if Hong Kong was still holding out,we ought to be able to reinforce our garrison there.  In general,  therefore, thefleet should be able to give covering protection to trade in the East, to preventJapan undertaking any major operation against India,  Australia, New Zealandor Borneo.  Once the fleet is established at Singapore, the risk of Japanese attackon India, Australia  or  New  Zealand would, in effect,  be  reduced to that ofraids only;  and even this risk should be slight and, in the case of India, probablynegligible.  Subsequent  naval action  would depend upon the result of testingthe efficiency of the Japanese navy.     60.  It must be  noted that,  should we require to  reinforce the Air Forcesin the Far East to counter any Japanese operations designed to establish powerfulshore-based  air  forces in  any  particular area, our only adequate source of rein-forcements would be our Metropolitan Air Force.   Any serious reduction of this force would leave  the United  Kingdom  dangerously  inferior  in  the air toGermany.     61.  On the economic side Japan could ensure the security of her vital shortsea routes.  With the fleet at Singapore we  should cut Japan&apos;s trade routes with europe and Southern Asia.  As regards the trans-Pacific route, our naval forces,if working from Canadian ports, which  had been made suitable for the purpose,and  the West  Indies, could  interfere with imports for Japan by action against japanese shipping and by the exercise of contraband control, activities with which japan should  not be able seriously to interfere on account of the great distancesinvolved.  Action by the United States of America as regards placing an embargo-on the supply of war materials to belligerents would virtually close this source of supply to Japan.  It may be noted that recent economic developments in Japanhave rendered her much less self-sufficient than used to be the case.     62.  As regards Empire trade, we must be prepared for the loss of the  Chinatrade, and for initial losses in  the Pacific and Indian oceans.   A full examinationof the situation leads us to believe that, after the  arrival of the British  fleet at Singapore, the economic position of  the British Empire should not be seriouslythreatened by any scale of attack that can  reasonably be expected.     63.  The  position, therefore, would appear to be that Japan might have to&apos;rely  almost entirely on her short sea routes, a situation which might produce mostserious economic results for her after a period of some two years or more, duringwhich time the British Empire would not be  subjected to any comparable economicdislocation.  In the economic sphere, therefore, we enjoy very definite advantagesover Japan, advantages that in the long run should prove decisive.     64.  The most important  features  in our policy in the event&apos; of an aggression by Japan may be summed up  as follows :      (a) The provision at Singapore  of all facilities necessary for its use by the-           fleet as a base, and the organisation of its defences so that even ii the           Japanese attempt major operations against it, they would have  small           prospect of establishing themselves in a position from which to deny           the use of the base to the fleet on its arrival.     (b) The  immediate  despatch of  the   fleet (at  the  strength  described  in           paragraph 56) to the Far East.     (c) Action against the trans-Pacific trade route of Japan.
                                    uDominion Assistance.     65.  Co-operation by the Dominions and India would be of great importance,and might take the following  forms.   Australia and New  Zealand could giveeffective naval co-operation.  They could  maintain in their own countries armyand air  units which would  be  available  to  reinforce  Singapore  and  evenHong Kong if circumstances permitted, and co-operate in action to prevent theestablishment of,  or to recapture,  any advanced Japanese base in  New  Guinea,Borneo, the Netherlands East Indies or adjacent islands.  They might provide and maintain in peace army and air units at Singapore as part of the permanentgarrison.  The Union Government could provide facilities for the passage of thefleet if it moved via the Cape and defended bases; also air squadrons to replaceUnited Kingdom squadrons in Central Africa, the Sudan or  Egypt,  therebyreleasing the latter for operations in the Ear East.  India could provide reinforce-ments for Singapore.  Canada could provide facilities for our naval forces on herWestern seaboard, and co-operate with her  naval and air forces in operations against Japanese trans-Pacific trade.The Mediterranean.    66.   Our security in. the Mediterranean has in the past depended to a largedegree on friendship with  Italy and  the weakness of Spain.   Until it becomescertain that these two assets have  definitely vanished, and while we are  alreadyrearming on a  very large  scale to meet other liabilities, we should be unwise to attempt in addition the  far-reaching developments which  would be necessaryto establish our security in the Mediterranean on  a purely military basis.    67.   Indeed, it is only  while we avoid war against Italy that the security ofour sea communications  through the  Mediterranean, which is one of our chiefinterests in that area, can be maintained.    If we  were at  war with  Italy,  any  British convoy  passing through theMediterranean&apos; could be attacked by the main Italian Fleet, and would thereforeneed the escort of equally powerful  naval forces, and  its passage would  thus become a major fleet operation.    Consequently, immediately war broke out  against  Italy, as much  british shipping as  possible would  have to be diverted to the  Cape route.    In addition to the threat from Italian naval forces, British shipping in theneighbourhood of the Malta Channel  would be exposed to heavy  attacks from italian shore-based aircraft and, pending  war experience, we cannot rely duringthe first few weeks of war on shipping army and air re-inforcements through theWestern Mediterranean  to Egypt, except such limited forces and equipment as could be conveyed in His Majesty&apos;s ships.     Thus, our sea communications through the Mediterranean can  only be madereally secure, either by  maintaining  friendship  with Italy, or  by establishingourselves in such  military  strength in the  Mediterranean as  would permanentlydeter Italy from embarking on war against us.    68.  The danger that  Italy will attack our  interests would only be likely to arise if we were engaged in a war with another Power and Italy considered thather intervention might lead to our defeat.   From this it follows that our militaryestablishments  in  the  Mediterranean would need to be independent of  thosenecessary for our other liabilities in order that they might constitute an effectivedeterrent against Italy.   In these circumstances  our needs  would be immense.They would include major increases in our naval strength and the construction ofan additional naval base in the  Eastern Mediterranean.  Our army  and air forcegarrisons in the Mediterranean and  Middle East would have to be materiallyincreased, the  defences  of our existing bases woiild have to  be  strengthenedand overland  communications from  the  South  and  East  to  the eastern mediterranean would have to be developed.    If it should  become our policy to  adopt these measures  their development would take  several years.   Our  immediate  problem is  how,  with our existing resources, we could best defend  our Mediterranean possessions and other interestsin the event of aggression by Italy.     69.  In a single-handed war the  British Fleet is the chief means by which,.through interference with trade, we might hope to bring effective pressure upon      [14201]                    .                                   D
Italy.  Our Army and Air Force in Egypt could, even independently of the Navy,prevent direct communication between Italy and her East African colonies andthus add to our pressure on Italy.     70.  Although in a single-handed war, our naval superiority over Italy wouldbe very great, our operations would be handicapped by our lack of bases.  Wecannot, pending war experience of A.A.  defences,  rely on the full  facilities  of malta being available for the fleet in war, and we should have to supplement ourwestern and central bases at Gibraltar and Malta by improvising an eastern base.Lack of dock accommodation is a serious difficulty.     71.  A major difficulty in  organising our defence measures would lie in theextreme risks to which reinforcements for our army and air garrisons would be exposed if they were moved through the Mediterranean once war had broken out.Even their movement via the Red Sea would be uncertain, since Italian air forces &apos;in Eritrea and Abyssinia might subject British shipping in the Red Sea to intenseattacks.  Reinforcements might initially be limited to units and equipment whichcould be conveyed  in His Majesty&apos;s ships  or moved by air or overland via eitherEast Africa or  Iraq.     72.  There is a grave possibility of the recurrence of trouble in Palestine, but apart  from this,  the situation in the Middle  East  generally is now greatly improved and when friendly relations with Italy have been permanently restored,will again be satisfactory.Dominion A assistance.     73.  Our future position may be further complicated if Italy develops stronglocal and native forces in Abyssinia, when it would probably become necessary toincrease our forces in the Sudan and East Africa. This development is one whichmight react on the interests of the Union of South Africa, and, if  it takes place,would call  for  the  closest co-operation  between  the LTnion and  the UnitedKingdom.  Both the Union of South Africa and India would have it in their power, given adequate peace-time preparations, to  co-operate very effectively  in meeting an Italian attack in. North and East Africa.Defence of India against Soviet Aggression.     74.  The remaining liability of importance is  the defence of  India againstSoviet aggression.  While this liability cannot be ignored, the threat is, as already mentioned in paragraph 31, at present of less urgency than those dealt with inpreceding paragraphs.     75.  The responsibility of  the Navy would, in the main, consist of safe-guarding  the lines of  communication, and  our  present naval strength is quiteadequate to carry this out.     The brunt of the campaign would, in the first instance, be  borne by the Armyand the Royal Air Force in India.  Of recent years a new and serious menace toIndia has developed from  the  modernised Soviet air  force equipped with  longrange aircraft.     The Army and Royal Air Force in India are not maintained in peace on a scalecommensurate to meet a  major danger to the integrity of her northern frontier of this nature.   Behind the forces which the Government of India maintain arethe reinforcements which might be despatched from the Middle East, the UnitedKingdom  or elsewhere,  and we shall  not  be  satisfactorily  prepared to meetSoviet aggression until we can maintain in India an air defence organisation andan air force capable of immediate and  effective  air counter-offensive  againstSoviet attack.     76.  The scale on which land operations could  be  conducted during the first few months and until  communications had  been developed, would be limited  bythe  nature of the  theatre of operations.  Contingents from  the Army at homewould, therefore, be required to reach India at  intervals over  a period of several months, as  lines of  communication  become adequate.  At the same time it isproposed to build  up a reserve  in the Middle East to preserve order and to dealwith the situation  should the conflict spread to Mohammedan countries.
     When its deficiencies have been made good to meet potential requirements inEurope the Army will be able to play its part provided that an emergency does notoccur in both continents at the same time.Dominion Assistance.     77.  Erom the foregoing it is clear that the chief need in the event  of  a soviet attack  on  India to-day would be for bomber squadrons  and air  defence units.  This is a matter in which any Dominion which in peace maintained these units would be able to co-operate.World War.     78.  At the present time if war should break out and spread  it seems possiblethat we,  with France  and  her Allies, might be  involved  against  Germany,Italy and Japan.  The issues with which we should be faced  even among the major Powers would be dependent on numerous uncertain factors.  Any attemptto forecast the action of the minor  Powers, which might be  drawn into the conflict, would be conjectural, but we are informed by the Foreign Office  that poland, Yugoslavia and  Turkey, are unlikely to join in hostilities against us oreven follow a  policy  hostile to us,  provided  we are strong.     79.  A few broad statements only can usefully be  made as  to the situation of the British Empire in such a world war.     The security of the United Kingdom and the security of Singapore would bethe keystones  on  which  the survival of  the British Commonwealth of nations would depend.  We should anticipate a direct air offensive against the former atthe outset. Attack upon the latter might be delayed, but would not necessarily be prevented by Japan&apos;s engagement with the U,S.S.R..  since there is, at present,no Soviet  surface fleet in the Far  East, and, consequently, there would be littlerestriction on  Japanese naval operations.  A British fleet would have to  proceedto the Far East leaving sufficient strength in home waters to neutralise the german fleet.     80.  We  could  rely on France  to neutralise  the Italian  fleet  in  theMediterranean to   some  extent,  to   maintain  command  of  the western mediterranean, and, with the assistance of the U.S.S.R.,  to prevent essential tradereaching Italy. At the same time, so long as we retained our position in Egypt,we could control the  Suez Canal.  Some or all of our Mediterranean possessionsmight be in a state of siege, and we might be hard put to it to maintain our forcesin Egypt; but this weakness in the Mediterranean  would not be nearly so serious as the surrender  of  our sea power in the Far East.    That would enable theJapanese to undertake deliberate operations against Singapore, which in  default of any possibility of relief,  might fall, leaving the coasts of India, Australia andNew Zealand and the sea routes to these Dominions open to Japanese attack.     81.  This situation demands recognition of -the principle that no anxietiesor risks connected with  our interests  in the Mediterranean can be  allowed tointerfere with the despatch of a fleet to the Far East.Dominion  Assistance.    82. If the British Empire is again faced with the necessity for fighting forher existence in a world war, the period of her greatest  danger is likely to occur in the earliest phase.  However willing any Member of the British Commonwealthof Nations may be to throw its weight into the war, her  contribution during thisearlier phase will be dependent upon  the preparatory  measures which she hastaken in time of peace.  Every measure which has been referred to as of value inthe single-handed wars which we have considered would be of even greater value in a world war.   In  addition to the provision of fully-trained forces for opera-tions in the theatre  of  war, the relief by partially trained Dominion units of regular British  Army  and  Air Force  units stationed overseas, outside   theimmediate theatre of operations, would be of great  value.     The ability of any Dominion to  help constitutes no commitment for  that dominion.  The decision on this point rests with the Dominion Government,  and unless the  Dominion Government chooses to make a  specific undertaking, no plans       [14201]                                   &apos;                 D 2
based upon the assumption  that  particular Dominions will  co-operate can  be formulated in peace.  In a war in which every resource will be taxed to its utmostwhatever assistance is given will, nevertheless, be of the utmost value.                          PART  V. CONCLUSIONS.    83.  From the foregoing review of the current problems of Imperial  Defencewe define  the military liabilities for  which  the  British Commonwealth  ofNations should at the present time be prepared in the following  terms and orderof priority :          Security of our Imperial Communications throughout the world.        Security of the United Kingdom  against German aggression.        Security  of Empire interests  in  the Far  East  against Japanese             aggression.        Security of interests in the Mediterranean and Middle East.        Security of India against Soviet aggression.    84.  The available  evidence does not show that any Power  intends  a directact of  aggression against the British  Empire in the immediate future,  and theAnglo-German Naval Treaty, to which we attach the greatest importance, is  ofinterest in this connection.   Nevertheless Germany&apos;s intensive rearmament, the root causes of which lie outside the scope of this review; her organization of thewhole structure of the  nation on  a military basis; the policy of economic  self-sufficiency and the strain which its application has produced; and her policy  of future  expansion  : all these factors have necessarily alarmed her neighbours andcreated conditions in which the  danger of  war  in Europe remains acute. Fromtime to time there may  be an alleviation in the situation, but this is no time fordesisting from rearmament in the absence of an international settlement.    Strategically, the future of the United Kingdom,  and with it the future  ofthe British Empire, is closely linked with that of France and the Low Countries.If Germany crushed France she would dominate all Western Europe and would gain power and prestige which would render the situation immensely, difficult forthe United Kingdom.    British military  interest in  Central and Eastern  Europe is only  indirect,but German expansion by force of arms  in an Eastward direction might involveFrance by reason of the latter&apos;s Pacts with Poland,  Czechoslovakia  and theU.S.S.R.    In these  circumstances  it might be impossible  for the  United Kingdomeventually to stand aside, if the only alternative was likely to be the domination of Western Europe by Germany.  Only this,  from a military  point  of  view,would justify us  in taking part in a European war at the present  time arisingout of events in Eastern Europe.  We might, therefore, find ourselves ranged onthe side of France and the  U.S.S.R. against  Germany, but  it is  outside ourprovince  to comment upon the  political  consequences of  such an  alignment.A more direct potential  source  of enmity between the United Kingdom  andGermany is the campaign upon which the latter has embarked for the return of her Colonies.    85.  In the Far East there is no evidence that  Japan is at present likely  to challenge us  directly  unless we  are already at  war in Europe, when she wouldprobably exploit our difficulties.  The Singapore defences are nearing completion,but they alone do not secure our strategic position in the East.   The despatch  ofa Fleet to  the Far East remains the operation  upon which the security of theEastern half of the Empire depends.    86.  In the Mediterranean, the United  Kingdom and  Italy each have thepower  to threaten communications essential to  the  other and  there  is reason  toassume that  Italy, so long  as the Fascist regime continues,  will show herselfmore adventurous and aggressive than in the past.   We hope, however, that therecent  Anglo-Italian  declaration will  restore a certain degree of Anglo-Italianco-operation, but  it would be rash to count on an immediate return to conditions under which Italy could, in all circumstances, be relied upon to follow a friendlypolicy  towards this  country.  The danger that Italy will  attack our  interests would  only&apos; be likely to  arise if  we were engaged in a war  with another Powerand Italy considered that her intervention might lead to our defeat.
    87.  The defence of India is a permanent liability for our forces which can never be ignored, however remote the danger of attack may appear, since theorganisation of her defence could not be effected at short notice.    88.  The  rearmament  of  the forces  of the  United  Kingdom  has been initiated on a large scale primarily as an insurance against the dangers inherent in the present policy of Germany, and to enable the British Navy to provide anadequate fleet to meet liabilities in the Far East, while leaving in home watersa fleet materially superior to that of Germany.  Possible directions in which theDominions might co-operate with the United Kingdom, in various contingencies,are summarised in the Annex to this report.    In contrast to what is possible under the autocratic regimentation of industryin dictator States, rearmament under conditions  which do  not dislocate our peace-time economic system must be a comparative slow process,  showing littleoutput at first. Once effective output starts, it will gather volume rapidly, andthe provision of equipment should cease to limit the efficiency and expansion ofour forces.    In the meantime, our forces inevitably remain inadequate to meet the full weight of the liabilities which they may have to face.    89.  The task  of rearmament is an immense one and the risks during theperiod of rearmament are great, not only because we have not achieved the strength at which  we aim, but because the period  of rearmament is  a period of somedisorganisation and dislocation.   The danger that British security and interestsmay be challenged  is  already a real one and is becoming increasingly apparentas Germany&apos;s military strength  increases.    In these circumstances, the danger of war is  in inverse proportion  to thestrength  which we are  believed to represent.  There are signs that the worldhas been deeply impressed by  the steps already taken to strengthen the defence forces and  defences of the Commonwealth, and  we believe  that the greatestservice in the cause of peace which the Members of the British Commonwealth ofNations can give at the present time is to demonstrate to the world a determination to rearm and a readiness to defend their vital interests.
