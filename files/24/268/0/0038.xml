        (THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S (ffiVERNMBNT)SEC R.E T.  .                                                    COPY NO  C*,QC.P.88(37)                              CABINET.                           RENT RESTRICTION.                Memorandum &quot;by the  Secretary of  Stats  for  Scotland.         In his Paper (CP.84(37))dealing with  the Rent Restriction Acts in    their application to  England and Wales, the Minister  of Health recommends    the appointment  of a  strong Departmental  Committee to enquire into and    report upon the  present working of the  Acts and to advise what steps should    &quot;be taken  to continue  or amend  them.   As  the  existing Acts apply  to the    United Kingdom as a whole, an  Inquiry such  as the Minister contemplates    would have to extend  to Scotland.    I think,  therefore, that my colleagues    in considering the Minister&apos;s  proposals should carefully review the position    in &quot;both countries.         As far as Scotland is concerned the  recently completed overcrowding    survey shows that some 23^ of  working class houses are overcrowded, compared    with an average  of 3.8?o in England and  Wales, and that at least 250,000 new    houses -  one quarter  of the existing total  -  will have to be built to  deal  with    the slums and overcrowding.    In  these circumstances I am quite  satisfied    that any  relaxation of the existing measure of control in Scotland is    impracticable.         The  general housing  situation in Scotland is much worse than in    England and Wales, but there are areas  even in England where unsatisfactory    conditions admittedly exist.   I note that  the Minister thinks that to    continue  the present  Acts unchanged for a further period would be difficult    to justify.   I  believe that continuation could reasonably be supported,    on   the  grounds that though the position in  some parts of England waa    becoming satisfactory the surveys  under the Housing Acts had shown that there    was still much to be  done before substantial  modification  of the present    Rent Restriction-Acts could be generally  undertaken.                                                             i       There/
                  &quot;There v/ill certainly be disadvantages in throwine the whole   question of the scope and. nature of the hots open to essuaimtioii by s. Committee,   and in the public discussions, and parliamentary debates, which will follow its   Report.   If the Scottish position were separately met repercussions would   inevitably follow which might lead to difficulties both in Parliament and in   the country.   For these reasons I should be in favour of an announcement   that the Government has decided to continue for a period the Acts in their   present form.                                                 W.E . .Scottish Office   Whitehall, S.W.1.5th March, 1937.
