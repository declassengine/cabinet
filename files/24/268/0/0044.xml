THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOYERNMENJPrinted for the Cabinet.  March 1937.SECEET.Copy  No-  3;CP. 94 (37).CABINET.COMMITTEE  ON  THE  ORGANISATION  OF  THE  COAL  MINING                              INDUSTRY.                            THIRD  REPORT.    THE Committee was appointed on the 8th May,  1935,  (Cabinet 26  (35),Conclusion 4).  The composition of the Committee has since been enlarged, andis now as follows :          The President of the Board of Trade (Chairman).        The Lord Chancellor.        The Home Secretary.        The Lord Privy Seal.        The Minister of Health.        The Minister of Labour.        The Attorney-General.        The Financial Secretary to the Treasury.        The Secretary for Mines.    2.  Our First Report was submitted on the 26th July, 1935, (CP. 160.(35))and our Second Report on the 26th May, 1936, (CP. 143 (36) ).    3.  The  main  problem referred to the. Committee for examination is the unification of coal mining royalties.   The other problems on which the Committeehave been called to  advise are     (a)  the reorganisation of  the coal mining industry  by means of amalgama-          tions, brought  about,  if necessary, by compulsion with a view  to          which the Coal Mines Reorganisation Commission was set up, under          Part II of the Coal Mines Act, 1930.    (b)  the extension for a further  five years (until the end of 1942) of the pro-          visions of Part I of the Act of 1930, together with certain modifications,          designed to safeguard consumers in the powers of the Committees of          Investigation set up under that Act.  (It will  be remembered  that          Part I provides the powers under which the production,  supply and          sale of coal are regulated by means of the old &quot;quota v-arrangements          and the new selling schemes.)    It will be convenient to deal with these two latter questions first.     Compulsory Amalgamations and Part I of  the Coal Mines Act, 1930.Compulsory Amalgamations.    4.  The Coal Mines Reorganisation Commission was set up under Part  ii of the Coal Mines Act, 1930, which charged it with the duty  of furthering there organisation of the coal mining industry and for that purpose of promoting andassisting amalgamations where they appear to the Commission to be in thenational interest.  The Act provided machinery  for  the exercise of compulsion,through the Railway and Canal Commission, in cases where it proved impossibleto secure voluntary reorganisation.

    5.  The  efforts of  the  Coal Mines Reorganisation Commission to secureadequate  voluntary  reorganisation failed,  owing  to  the attitude  of passive-resistance adopted by the coal owners as a whole.  Indeed, after the fall of theLabour Government, an attempt was made by the owners to create an impression that coal mines amalgamation was a purely Labour Party Scheme, which needno longer be taken seriously in the changed circumstances.  This attempt wascountered by a declaration which  the then Attorney-General was  authorised tomake on the 31st May, 1932, to the effect that the National Government intendedthe Reorganisation Commission .to proceed with its task and to use the powers which it possessed.    6.  After further fruitless efforts to secure voluntary action, the Reorganisa-tion Commission at length decided to resort to the compulsory provisions of the^1930 Act.  It was apparent, however, that the efficacy of their powers was at leastdoubtful.  Accordingly, in July 1935, the  Government asked the ReorganisationCommission not to take any further steps  in the direction  of compulsion for thetime being, pending consideration of the whole position.    7.  Subsequently,  the legal issue was referred to the Law Officers of theCrown, who advised,  in December  1935, that if compulsory amalgamation was desired as a matter of policy, amendment of the law was necessary.    8.  The situation then was therefore as follows : The Commission was clearlyintended by Parliament to have powers of  compulsion : and in the debates on theBill of 1930 all parties assumed that the Bill gave those  powers,   It had now,however, become clear that the Act did not in fact give&apos;the powers which it was intended (and thought) to give.  It was  clearly impossible to leave matters as theywere, namely, to  keep a statutory Commission  in being,  bereft  of  any realauthority.  The alternatives before the  Government were either to repeal Part II(and, thereby specifically to abandon the  policy of furthering amalgamations in thecoal industry,  if necessary by compulsion) or to amend it in such a way as to givethe Commission the powers which Parliament originally intended to give them.    9.  This issue was placed before the Cabinet on the 19th February,  1936, bythe President  of the Board of Trade (CP. 44 (36)), and the Cabinet instructed the Secretary  for  Mines to  prepare a  Bill amending Part II  of  the 1930 Act(Cabinet 8 (36) Conclusion 7) :  and accordingly, on the 25th February,  1936, theSecretary for  Mines announced in the  House of Commons that the government intended to introduce a Bill  to amend Part II  so as  to give the Commissioneffective powers.    10.  The  amending Bill the Coal  Mines Bill, 1936 was introduced in May1936. It provided new machinery, substituting Parliament  as the ultimate arbiterof compulsion, and confining the scope  of the Railway and Canal Commission todeciding  the  terms  (i.e.,  the apportionment  of the  shares  of the  new  or&quot; transferee&quot;  company  among the &quot; transferor &quot; companies) upon  which  a compulsory reorganisation scheme, previously sanctioned by Parliament, should becarried out.  The inherent weakness of the old machinery of Part II lay in theobligation imposed upon the Reorganisation Commission to provide legal proof,in the case of a compulsory scheme (a) that it was in the national interest, (b) thatit would result in lowering costs,  (c) that it would not be financially injurious to any of the  undertakings proposed to be amalgamated, and (d) that the terms proposed were fair and equitable to everyone affected.  In other words, conditions were  imposed  which were practically impossible of literal  fulfilment.  It was toavoid these difficulties that the new machinery was devised.     11.  Opportunity was  also taken,  in the 1936 Bill,  to obtain amendment ofthe law in another direction, viz. :  in regard to Part I  of the Act of 1930. v Atthis point, therefore, we can conveniently deal with the Part I issue.                     Part I of the Coal Mines Act, 1930.Extension of Period (see CP. 106 (36) ).     12.  This Part of the Act provides the powers under  which the production,supply, and sale of coal are regulated.  It originally ran  for two  years-to theend of 1932--and it was extended for  five more to the end of 1937.  It will beremembered that an  important factor in the settlement of the national wages
crisis which occurred in the  industry in the winter of 1935-36 was the under-taking given by the coalowners shortly before the General Election, at the instanceof the Government (vide Cabinet 46 (35) p. 10 of Conclusions), that they wouldwithout delay set. up selling machinery throughout the industry, under the powersof Part I, in order to eliminate inter-district competition, and secure a fair price for coal.  This machinery was duly set up last year; it came into  operation onthe 1st August, 1936.    13.  It was obviously desirable, in the interests of the new selling  schemes,and in order to implement what was an implied pledge to the workmen, to givethe schemes as soon as possible statutory assurance of adequate tenure.  So theBill of 1936 contained provisions to extend the operation of Part I for anotherfive years from the present date of its expiry  (the  31st December,  1937).  Thisprovision is embodied in Part III  (Clause 34) of the Bill which we  are nowrecommending for acceptance by the Cabinet.The Coal Mines Bill,  1936.    14.  This Bill met with  a great deal of criticism,  and accordingly in intro-ducing it, the  President of the Board of  Trade promised that the Governmentwould amend the  amalgamations part of  it in three  important respects viz.;(i) to provide for a two-year respite from the exercise of  compulsion, (ii) to exclude&quot; ancillary undertakings &quot; (e.g., iron and steel companies owning  their owncollieries) from the operation of the Bill,  and (iii)  to  provide an &quot; independentimpartial authority&quot;  to deal with objections to compulsory schemes.    15.  These concessions, however, did not placate the critics, largely becausethe bulk of the criticism of the  Bill was concerned not with  the amalgamationproposals at all, but with the Part I amendment and the  selling schemes, whichwere represented as being about  to give the industry a monopoly without proper safeguards for  consumers against  exploitation.   And ultimately the  PrimeMinister announced (on the 28th May, 1936) that while the Government held  tothe principles  of the Bill, they would re-draft  it, and  ask the House  to proceedwith the new Bill after  the Summer Recess.                    Part I of the Coal Mines Act, 1930.Alteration in the powers of Committees of Investigation.    16.  This course it was not found practicable to carry out;, but in the mean-time the Secretary for Mines came to an&apos; agreement with the colliery owners and representatives of  the Public Utility Undertakings (who had been most vocal intheir criticism of the Coal Mines Bill and selling schemes) regarding amendmentsdesigned to strengthen the machinery of the Central and District Committees of investigation appointed under Part I of the original Act to deal with complaintsfrom consumers.  In consequence, the opposition which has been organised by thePublic Utility Undertakings against the Coal Mines Bill, and threatened againstthe selling schemes, ceased.   These amendments, which  we  now suggest  shouldbe incorporated in the new Bill, are intended  to secure greater  efficiency andexpedition for the Committees of Investigation.  They are as  follows :  (a) thatin the event of the  members of  a Committee of Investigation not being unanimouson any question, an independent chairman, who will be a member of the legal profession, shall take the decision on behalf of  the  Committee; and (b) that inrespect of any complaint made to a Committee regarding any act or omission ofany persons in respect of their functions under a statutory coaLselling scheme,the decision of the Committee shall forthwith be binding on  the parties.  Wehave embodied these amendments in the present Bill (see Clause  34 and NinthSchedule of the draft  dated the 9th March, 1937).New Compulsory Amalgamation Proposals.    17.  While, however, it was found that the consumers&apos; opposition could thus be removed, the amalgamations  problem remained  one of great difficulty.  Weexamined it carefully  last October, but decided to make no submission to the       .[14817]                                                   B  2
Cabinet at that time.  Since then, we have come to the conclusion that the best,as well as the most logical solution, is specifically to link the compulsory  amal-gamation machinery to the royalties proposals, as being an integral part of  theGovernments general policy for the reorganisation of the coal mining industry,rather than to deal with it  by a separate Bill.The  New A malgamations Clauses.     18.  With this object two clauses and a schedule (Clauses 32  and 33 andEighth Schedule) have been embodied in the attached draft Bill to take the placeof the amalgamation provisionsdn the 1936 Bill.  It will be seen that these clausesprovide specifically for linking the promotion of amalgamations with  royaltiesunification by the merging of the Coal Mines Reorganisation Commission withthe coal royalties Commission (Clause 32) and the provision (Clause  33 (1)) thatin granting  new  mineral leases  it  shall be the duty of the Commission  toendeavour  to effect a reduction  in  the number  of undertakings  (see also paragraph 46 below).     19.  As  regards the  machinery,  we have preserved as far as  possible  theoriginal  machinery of Part  II of  the 1930  Act viz., the  Railway and  canal commission  procedure, a policy which we  think will be more  acceptable  toParliament than  the suggested machinery  of  the 1936 Bill.  We have,  however,suggested important modifications in the old machinery,  so as to remove  the causes of its  ineffectiveness.  The first  stage in the application of compulsion will now  require the sanction of  Parliament, which will have to approve  an  Order ofthe Board of Trade, made on the application of the Reorganisation Commission,authorising the application  of compulsion to a  particular  area  (Clause 33 (2)).Compulsion can then be applied  to this area.  The ultimate compulsory power will   reside,  as   before,  in  the  Railway  and  Canal  Commission.   But,   as parliament   will  have  already  accepted  the  view that  amalgamation  is&apos;&apos; expedient&apos;&apos; in  the area, it will no longer be for the Court to consider whetherit  is  &quot; in the national  interest.&quot;  Nor will it be necessary to prove to the  court the propositions inevitably incapable of legal proof that the amalgamation will&quot;not be financially injurious &quot; to anyone, and that it &quot; will result in  loweringthe cost of production  or disposal  of coal.&quot;  What the Court must satisfy itselfabout is that the  terms of the scheme are fair and equitable to  everyone, and likely to enable the new concern to be efficiently carried on with due regard to everyone&apos;s rights.  If they are satisfied about this, they must confirm the scheme(see  Eighth Schedule).  If not, they  can alter  the terms,  or reject the schemealtogether.     20.  The new clause  also, in its  effect, carries out the three promises madeby the President of the Board of Trade (see paragraph 14 above).  The exclusion of &quot; ancillary undertakings &quot; is automatically effected  by the return  to  themachinery of Part II of the 1930 Act.   And  the demand  for an .&quot; impartialauthority &quot; is met, in  the first place,  by retaining to a large extent the existing machinery of the  Railway and Canal Commission, and, in the second place,  by requiring the sanction of Parliament before compulsion  can be applied.  Asregards the two years&apos; respite, which  is provided for specifically (Clause 33 (1)),we think that it  will have to run from the date of the introduction of the newBill.  In the Bill of 1936 it was made to run from the 1st July, 1936, and  although there is no justification for giving the coalowriers yet another year of immunity,we do not consider that it would be politically practicable, in all the circumstances,to retain this date in the new Bill.     21.  We are advised  by the Attorney-General that these new provisions  for compulsory-amalgamation seem likely to be effective in removing the weakness ofthe old machinery, and we recommend their acceptance, and their embodiment inthe Royalties Bill as an integral part  of a comprehensive policy for the reorganisation -sation of the coal industry.  There can be no question, in our view, of abandoning the policy of promoting amalgamations, and  although we  would greatly preferthem to be on a voluntary basis, we cannot recommend dispensing with the element of compulsion.                                           ,:   : .
5337                         Unification of Coal Royalties.      22.  We  turn  now to the main problem of the  unification of coal mining- royalties.      The Bill  adopts this expression in preference to &quot;nationalisation.&quot;  We believe the difference between the two conceptions to be as follows.  &apos;&apos; Nationalisa- tion &quot; implies the vesting of the property in the Crown, payment for it by means of a Government loan, and  its administration by a  Government Department. &quot; Unification&quot;  implies the vesting of the property in a statutory Corporation, payment for it by means of a loan raised by that Corporation, on the security of the property (with  or without a Treasury  guarantee)  and its administration  by that Corporation, subject to such specific provision for Parliamentary control as may be made in the Statute.  In addition, by adopting&quot; unification &quot; the Govern- ment will  emphasise the fact  that  the  fundamental  difficulty of the existing situation does not lie  in  private ownership so much  as in  the multiplicity  of ownership, which constitutes a hindrance  to economical working.      23.  It is unnecessary at  this stage to carry the history of the royalties question further back  than the Cabinet meeting of the 15th October,  1935,  at which it was agreed :            &quot; To approve the unification of  Royalties  in principle  .... and  to      authorise the Cabinet Committee to prepare a detailed scheme, draft a Bill      and open negotiations with representatives of Royalty Owners.&quot;              (Cabinet 36 (35) page 10 of Conclusions.)      Very shortly afterwards the following pledge  was included  in the joint Manifesto  issued on behalf of the Government before the General  Election  of 1935 :-          &apos;&apos; We have further decided  to  effect the  unification of coal-mining      royalties,  a step which will  enable  greater progress to be made with the      organisation of production and thus improve the efficiency of the industry.&quot;      The King&apos;s  Speech on the Opening of the present Session contained the following passage ::          &quot;You will be invited to consider proposals for  the furtherance of     reorganisation in the coal industry, and for the unification of coal royalties     under national  control.&quot;     24.  The scheme of unification which we recommend is contained in Part I of the draft Coal Bill attached to the present Report.   The main principle under- lying the scheme is that on an appointed day a statutory Corporation (Clause  1) known as the  Coal  Mines Commission (into which, if our proposals in regard to amalgamations are accepted, the Reorganisation Commission will  be merged under Clause 32)  will acquire (Clause 3 (1) and Second Schedule) the ownership of all the coal in the United Kingdom,  together with all the rights necessary for getting that coal and bringing it to the surface (Clauses 4 and 5).   The Commis- sion is to be a  non-Government and non-Civil Service  authority, consisting of a Chairman,  a Deputy Chairman and three other persons, all to be  appointed by the Board of Trade. No person who is in  any way directly connected with the industry is  eligible for membership until he relinquishes his connection; and no member may have any financial interest in  the industry after his appointment (First Schedule). Compensation to Royalty Owners.     25. The purchase price of this whole property is to be expressed as a global sum which is to be specified in the Bill (Clause 3 (2) ).   The global sum is to be paid out in compensation to the present owners of coal according to the proportion which the value of each individual property bears to the value of the whole.  It will be the  duty of a Compensation Tribunal appointed by the Board of Trade to apportion the global sum among the claimants (Third Schedule).  A reasonable period  will be allowed for the presentation of claims, and no  claim  will  be&apos; admitted after the period has expired.                              .
    26.  The compensation is to be paid in cash, which will be raised by a marketloan charged on  the property  and revenues of the Commission and  backed, ifnecessary, by the guarantee of  the Treasury.    27.  It should be emphasised  that our proposals  involve the simultaneousout-and-out acquisition  of all the property  and rights in  coal, known  andunknown, present and future.  The global purchase price is to be determined byan Arbitration Tribunal (as explained later), and is to be arrived at by multi-plying the present net annual revenue derived from the ownership of coal by theappropriate number of years&apos; purchase.Negotiations with-the  Royalty  Owners.    28.  At this point it is necessary to  refer as briefly as possible to the steps which have been taken  to determine the figure of the global sum which the royalty owners are to receive in  compensation.   The position was  reported orally tothe Cabinet on the 3rd February (Cabinet  5 (37)  Conclusion 13 and 6  (37)Conclusion 4).    29.  In  our  view, it  was politically impossible  for  the  Government tointroduce a Bill  which should  state  in a figure  the  amount of  the global  sum,unless that figure  were  previously  either  agreed by  the Royalty Owners, orascertained  by some form of  arbitration.   Equally, the alternative course of introducing a Bill including provision for arbitration is financially unthinkable.It would mean that the Government pledged themselves to acquire the royalties,no matter what cost of acquisition resulted from the  arbitration.  This wouldinvolve the distinct risk of such an inflated figure as would make the whole schemeinsolvent.    30.  Prolonged negotiations took place between the  Treasury and the royalty owners in the hope of arriving  at an agreed figure, but without success. A figure which was agreed is that of  4,430,000,  as being the present  net annual incomederived from the property and rights to  be purchased.  What has remained in dispute is the appropriate number of  years&apos; purchase by which this figure shouldbe multiplied in order  to arrive at the proper global price.    31.  After careful consideration, it was decided that in all the  circumstances the best course would be to refer this latter figure (the number of years&apos; purchase)to arbitration,  at the same time providing for a unilateral option to the Govern-ment  to decline to proceed with  the purchase if the figure named was unacceptable to them.    32.  The terms of reference, and  the personnel of the Arbitral Tribunal were announced in the House  of Commons by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the9th March.   It is anticipated that the Tribunahs&apos; decision will be given towardsthe end of April, and the Government will then have a period of six weeks withinwhich to exercise its option.    33.   Apart  from the question  of  compensation,  there  are  certain othermatters of major importance in the royalties scheme to which we desire to draw the attention of the Cabinet.Ministerial Control.    34.   As we  have  already  said (in paragraph 22  above)  the scheme is oneof unification and  not of  nationalisation.  We  have had to  consider carefully,therefore, what (if any) measure  of ministerial  control should be  provided for.There are, of  course,  several statutory  bodies  already  in  existence whoseconstitution and  scope are  to some extent comparable with the present case.  Wehave  examined these precedents,  and we  have  come to  the conclusion  that whilethe new Commission  should be independent of ministerial control  in the day to day business of administration, there should nevertheless  be a power vested in the Board of Trade to issue &quot;general directions,&quot; subject to certain limitations.The  obvious  justification  for  such a power  is that  coal  royalties  will,  afterunification, be a  form of public property, and must therefore  be administered inthe national interests, the ultimate judge of which can  only be Parliament.   TheBill (Clause 2 (2)) provides, therefore, that such general directions shall relate to.and be limited to,  such questions as  in the view of the Board of Trade involvethose interests.
7338 .    35.   In this  connection it will  be  observed  that  several parts of the Bill themselves impose precise obligations or restrictions on the Commission in matters of administrative policy, and  this necessarily  limits the sphere in which  such general directions could operate.  For example, the Commission may not engage in coal-mining (Clause 2 (1).),  as regards leases, the Bill says that existing leases shall  be  continued (Clause 8), that substituted leases shall  be  on  not less favourable  terms  than  those  they  replace  (Clause  10 (3)),  that &quot;working proprietors-&quot; shall receive leases on terms customary in the district, and adequate to enable the coal to be worked out (Clause 11  (2)), and that the Commission  shall reserve &apos;&apos; the best rent which in their opinion can  reasonably be obtained &apos;&apos; (Clause 14  (3)).   As  regards finance, there is an obligation on the  Commission to establish a reserve  fund  (Clause 13),  and the Commission is not exempt  from taxation (Clause 22). Surplus  Revenue.     36.  Another major point is the provision  for financial administration  and, in particular, for  the disposal of surplus revenue  (Clause 14).  The Bill provides adequately  for  amortisation  and  for  a  reserve  fund (Clause 13)  to  meet contingencies (e.g., a national stoppage).  But, even so, a surplus of revenue over expenditure may be expected, and ultimately,  when the Royalties Stock is repaid, administrative expenses and taxation will be the only charges on whatever revenue may then be received.  We have taken the view that any surplus revenue is for the industry,&apos; and not for the taxpayer.  The Bill, therefore, provides that such surplus is to be used first in levelling down anomalies of rent between individual companies within a district, and then between districts as a whole.  When there is no further scope  for this, Parliament  may, by  resolution, authorise the use of surplus  ingeneral remission  of rent.  This contingency cannot, however, arise for several decades. Mineral  Leases.     37.  The general function of the  Commission will be to grant leases on propercommercial terms, reserving the &apos;&apos; best rent  which  in their opinion can reasonably be obtained &quot; (Clause  14 (3)), subject to the provisions for&apos; the reduction of rents referred  to  in the preceding paragraph.     38.  The general  plan of the Bill contemplates the preservation of  all rights under existing leases.  Where such leases are &quot; mixed &quot; (i.e., of coal and of surface rights), the Commission are to have power  to require separate leases to be made and  accepted at their expense,  both  from the Commission as lessor  of  coal andfrom the present lessor as lessor of property not  vested in the  Commission(Clause 10 and Sixth Schedule). .    39.  A &quot;working proprietor,&quot; i.e., a  colliery undertaking  which owns thecoal it is working, is to be entitled to a lease of  that coal  on the terms customaryin the district,  for a long  enough period  to allow  the  coal  to be  worked out (Clause 11).Other provisions.     40.  As regards surface rights,  in place  of the existing jurisdiction of theRailway  and Canal  Commission, power is given to the  Board of Trade, on application by  the Commission,  to make an  order  granting  surface  rightsreasonably  required  for coal-mining,  the terms being left to agreement orarbitration  (Clause 5 and Fourth Schedule).     41.  As regards support of land, the general principle of the Bill is that theacquisition  of coal already severed from surface shall carry with  it  whateverrights and obligations (if any) are now attached to the coal.   Acquisition of coalnot previously severed is to carry with it the right to let down the surface subjectto compensation for actual damage done,  and subject also to the right  of the land-owner in proper cases to re-establish an absolute  right of support (for instance,under Section 8 of the Mines (Working Facilities  and Support) Act,  1923, whichis not being repealed).  (Clauses  3 (1)  and  5  (2) and Second Schedule, para-graphs 5-10.)
    42.  Other minerals which are workable with coal are not to be vested in theCommission, but the Commission may acquire  them by  agreement,  and grantleases  of them.   When the necessary  arrangements for joint working of  suchminerals with the coal cannot be obtained by agreement, recourse may be had tothe existing machinery of the Mines  (Working Facilities) Acts,  and an orderobtained from the Railway and Canal Commission.Position of Mineral Agents.    43.  Another question which we  have had to consider  in connection  withthe Bill is  the position of the mineral agents to the present Royalty Owners.  if our proposals in the Bill are  accepted,  all these  agents  will  continue in theirpresent employment until  the  work of  valuation has  been  completed and thepurchase money  paid over a period which  may  extend to  three years.    Inaddition, many of these agents will be employed by the Mineral Owners,  but atthe expense of the Commission on the valuation on a fee basis of the properties forthe purposes of  compensation claims.   Thirdly,  it is  clear that when the wholeproperty is finally taken over, a number of these agents will be offered permanent employment under the Commission.    It is clear, therefore, that a substantial measure of indirect compensation is actually inherent in our proposals.    44.  We  have carefully  considered  the  various precedent  cases  of  staffdisplaced in similar, or partially similar, cases,  and we  have come to  the conclusionthat we cannot recommend any provision for direct compensation,  partly for thereasons given in the preceding paragraph; partly because we can find no adequateprecedent for such a step, and we do not feel justified in creating a precedent ofsuch far-reaching implications; and also because politically though not logically it would be difficult to defend a proposal to compensate  professional  men displacedby the unification of royalties,  while refusing  compensation to miners  displacedby compulsory amalgamations.                       The Policy of a Combined Bill.    45.  As already-indicated, we recommend that the three fields of coal policywhich  require legislation unification of royalties,  compulsory amalgamationsand the amendment of Part I of  the Coal Mines Act, 1930 should be covered ina single Bill, and this has been provided for in the present draft (see paragraphs13, 16 and 18 above).    46.  In particular we consider that the duty of administering coal royaltiesand of promoting compulsory amalgamations should be entrusted to a single body(see Clause 32 and  paragraph 18 above).  On administrative grounds we think this suggestion is to be commended because the  Royalties Commission should be particularly well qualified to promote amalgamations both by the strength of its position  as  universal mineral  landlord  and by  the general experience  and knowledge of the industry which it will acquire in the course of its royalties work.As stated above  (paragraph 18) the granting of new leases and the promoting ofamalgamations are linked together in Clause 33.  On political grounds we thinkthat the combining of amalgamation provisions with  the  Royalties Bill  willprovide a satisfactory solution of the compulsory amalgamation problem  withoutthe provision of  such drastic powers of compulsion  as were embodied in the CoalMines Bill introduced last year.                                              *  ,,  47.  If  amalgamations and  royalties  are to be dealt with in one Bill, it is obviously convenient to include  in the same Bill the necessary amendments ofPart I of the Coal Mines Act, 1930, (Clause 34 and Ninth  Schedule).   But itshould be remembered that the passing of those amendments into law must not belong delayed.  The alterations in the powers of Committees of Investigation werepromised last summer and consumers will reasonably complain  at much further delay.  The extension of  the period of Part I must have the force of law beforethe 31st December of this year.
  .  48.  As regards the Royalties timetable, we presume that it is the Cabinet&apos;view that the royalties question shall be dealt with this Session.  We consider thatit is most desirable that as much progress as possible shall be made With completing the drafting of the clauses without waiting for the Tribunals decision. - (A gooddeal  more drafting work will be required on it before it  reaches the final form,including, inter alia, the necessary parallel provisions for Scotland.)  The factthat  the unification scheme involves the raising of a guaranteed loan is a cogentreason for taking action during the present Session.  The future of  money ratesis uncertain,  and delay might prejudice this essential part  of the plan.   Once,therefore, the  Bill has been introduced, we recommend that it should be pressed forward  and passed  into law without delay.    49.  We therefore recommend that the principles embodied in the Bill shouldbe approved by the Cabinet, and that the Bill should be introduced at the earliest opportunity, subject  to approval of the final drafting of the clauses by the presentCommittee, after consideration of any points which may emerge from technical discussions between the Mines Department and the  interests concerned.               Summary of Conclusions  and Recommendations.    50.  Our  conclusions and recommendations may be summarised as  follows(references to  paragraphs of Report) :  General.     (i) A copy of the draft Bill, dated the 9th March, 1937, is attached to this           Report.  Subject to their approval of the various detailed recommen-           dations set out hereunder, we recommend that the Cabinet should give           authority that,  if the figure of price decided upon by the Arbitration           Tribunal proves acceptable  to the  Government  (or, alternatively, if           an acceptable figure can be agreed with the royalty owners),  the Bill           shall be introduced forthwith.The  Policy of a Combined  Bill.   (ii) The policy which  we recommend has three inter-connected parts the           unification  of   royalties,  the  promotion  of   amalgamations,   by           compulsion if necessary, and the continuation of Part I of the Act of           1930, with the necessary modifications in regard to the Committees of           Investigation.  We  therefore recommend the  introduction and the           passage into law during the present Session of a single &apos;&apos; coal policy &apos;&apos;           Bill, dealing with all three subjects, in the form of the appended draft           (paragraphs  45-47).   (iii) We wish to  emphasise the  importance of proceeding with the Bill with           the utmost despatch.  The uncertainty as to the future of money rates           means  that  delay might prejudice the  solvency of the Royalties           scheme.  Moreover, the amendment of Part I of the Coal Mines Act,           1930, cannot  be long postponed (paragraphs 47-48).Unification of Royalties.   (iv) We recommend the acquisition on an appointed day by a statutory Coal           Mines  Commission of the ownership of all coal deposits, known and           unknown, in the United  Kingdom, and of  all  underground rights           necessary to work that coal and bring it  to the surface (paragraph 24).    (v) The purchase price of the whole property is to be expressed as a global           sum, which is to be specified in the Bill.  The global sum will be paid           in  cash in compensation to the present  owners of the coal, according           to  the proportion which the value of each property bears to the value           of the whole.  A reasonable period will be allowed for the  presentation           of  claims to  compensation, and  no claim will be  admitted after&apos; the           period has expired (paragraph 25).   (vi) The cash to provide the compensation will be raised by a loan charged on           the propeilw and revenues  of the Commission,  and backed  by  the           guarantee of the Treasury (paragraph 26).      .[14817]                                                      c
lit (vii) The average net annual value of the property as a whole has already been         agreed by the Treasury &quot;and the royalty owners to be  4,430,000, and         it has been agreed, in addition, to entrust a Tribunal with the duty of     .    fixing the number of years&apos; purchase  by  which,this  figure is to  be         multiplied, in order to arrive at the global value of the property. This         will be determined once for all.  It has  further been agreed that when       -  this global sum has been ascertained the Government shall have the         option within  six  weeks  of giving notice  that  in view of the figure         arrived- at, they do not propose to proceed with the purchase (para-         graphs 28-31)!&apos;(viii) The Commission will be free from Government interference in matters of         day-to-day administration, but  we recommend  that the  principle  of         Ministerial Control should  be maintained by means  of a power of the         Board of Trade to issue &quot; general  directions &quot; to the  Commission  on         matters involving the national interest (paragraphs  34-35).  (ix) We recommend that any surplus revenue which may accrue  to the Coni-         mission be applied for the- benefit of the industry, namely,  for  the         levelling down of anomalies of rent, first within districts, then between         districts as a whole, and finally  for the  general reduction  in rent over         the whole country  (the latter will require Parliamentary  approval  at         the time,  but is not likely to arise for decades) (paragraph  36).  (x) The general  function of the  Commission will be to  grant mineral leases         on proper commercial terms.  Rights under existing leases are to  be         preserved.  Companies, owning  the freehold  of  their  coal are to  be         given  leases on fair terms (paragraphs 37-39).  (xi) We recommend the approval of the proposals regarding acquisition  of         surface rights, support, and associated minerals (paragraphs 40-42). (xii) We consider that no compensation should  be paid to mineral  agents         (paragraphs  43-44).Compulsory Amalgamations (Part II of the Coal Mines Act,  1930).  (xiii) There can be no  question,  in our  view, of abandoning  the policy of           promoting amlgamations, and although we would greatly prefer them           to be on a voluntary basis,  we cannot recommend dispensing with the           element of compulsion (paragraph 21).  (xiv) We recommend linking  amalgamations  with royalties  so  as  to  form a           comprehensive  reorganisation policy,  and for this  purpose we  suggest           the merging of the Coal Mines Reorganisation  Commission with the           Coal Mines Commission set up to administer Royalties,  and the inter-           relation of their functions  (paragraph 18).   (xv) We propose a form of compulsory machinery less drastic than that in the           Bill of 1936, and, we hope, likely to be more acceptable to Parliament,           in that it (a)  retains as far as possible the original  machinery of           Part II of the Act of 1930, including the Railway  and Canal  Corn-           mission;  and (b) gives effect to the  concessions promised last  May.           The new  machinery makes Parliament the ultimate  authority for the           application of  compulsion to specified areas, but leaves to the Railway           and Canal Commission powers of confirming, modifying or rejecting           each actual scheme (paragraph 19).Production, Supply and Selling Schemes (Part I of the Act of 1930).  (xvi)  Part I of the Coal  Mines Act,  1930,  under which all these schemes           operate, is due to expire on the 31st December, 1937.  We recommend           that  it be  continued  in force  until  the   31st  December;  1932           (paragraph 13).
^ivii) Our Report  also  contains a  proposal for a modification  of Part  I,         intended to improve the machinery for dealing with complaints by         consumers  regarding the  operation of the selling schemes.  These         amendments were the subject of an agreement between the Secretary         for Mines  and the Public Utility  Undertakings last summer, as a         result of which the opposition of the latter to the extension of Part I         of the 1930 Act and to the Selling Schemes ceased (paragraph 16).                               Signed on behalf of the Committee :                                     WALTER RUNCIMAN, Chairman.   2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,         March 11,  1937.
