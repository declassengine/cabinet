Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.     THE proposed New Construction Programme for 1937 is as follows :            3 Capital Ships.           2 Aircraft Carriers.           7 Cruisers (5 of 8,000 tons, 2 of 5,000-6,000 tons).         16 Destroyers (i.e., 2 Flotillas,  two vessels being fitted as Leaders).           7 Submarines.           2 Escort Vessels (previously known as &quot;Sloops&quot;).           4 Minesweepers (previously known  as  &quot; Sloop Minesweepers &quot;).           3 Patrol Vessels (previously known as &quot;  Coastal Sloops &quot;).     A number of miscellaneous vessels;  namely :            1 Destroyer Depot Ship.           1 Submarine Depot Ship.           1 -Large  Surveying Ship.           1 Small Surveying Ship.          2 Large  River Gunboats.          2 Loop Minelayers.         10 Motor  Torpedo Boats.         16 Boom Defence Vessels.          2 Tugs.     A table is attached showing the financial effect of these proposals.     The governing principle upon which this programme has been drawn up isto achieve as early as practicable a modern Fleet of the strength called for bythe political formula upon which the Government decided in 1932, and which isquoted in paragraph  30 of Paper D.R.C. 37, enclosure  1 to CP. 26 (36).   Thatformula reads as follows :          &quot; We should be able to send to the Far East a Fleet sufficient to provide     cover against the Japanese Fleet;  we should have sufficient additional forces     behind this  shield for the protection of our territory and Mercantile Marine     against Japanese  attack; at the same time we should be able to retain in     European Waters a. force sufficient to act as a deterrent  and to prevent     the strongest European Naval Power from obtaining control of  our  vital     Home terminal areas while we can make the necessary redispositions.&quot;     The  Admiralty&apos;s estimate of  the  actual  strength required  on the basis ofthis  formula was given in Paper D.R.C. 37, and is summarised  at :         15 Capital Ships.        70 Cruisers (of which  10 could be overage).        16 Flotillas of Destroyers (of which 4 could be overage).The  estimate was based on the  assumption that there would be a  renewal of treaty limitation on a system of ratios, an assumption which has not, in fact, beeurealised.[14634]

In accordance with precedent, and by arrangement with the Treasury, a substantial    overhead cut is being imposed on the 1937 Estimates in order to discount in advance    possible delays by Contractors.  Some part of this cut will fall on the provision for new    construction in 1937, and the figure shown above of   7,520,000 will accoi-dingly be    reduced in the published Estimates to  6,263,000.     The  proposals for naval construction on  the  basis  of  the 1932  Formulaapproved by the Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements (CP.  26 (36))contemplated a rebuilding of the  Fleet over periods which varied  according tothe. category of the ship.   It was intended  that effect  should be given to this programme,  except as  regards Capital Ships, in about seven years.    Last summer the policy  of  expediting the new construction was initiated,with a view  to completing the programme as soon as possible.  The possibilities in this  direction were  examined by the Admiralty, and  summarised in PaperD.P.R.  88 (Revise) of  the 25th June  last.  The proposals in that paper weredefinitely accepted for 1936.   The proposals  in the 1937 Programme  now putforward follow precisely those indicated in paragraph 2 of D.P.R.  88  (Revise).    It is proposed  to order  the three, Capital ships of the new programme  atthe earliest  possible date; the  remaining vessels of  the  programme would  be ordered on various dates up to the end of the financial year.  It is very desirableto keep the building slips  occupied, and to prevent  skilled labour from  driftingaway owing  to any undue interval between the completion of one ship and thecommencement of  another.   The  programme has  been  drawn up with  this important consideration in mind.    In conclusion, it may be  said  that the 1937 New  Construction Programme,based as it is on Papers D.R.C. 37 and D.P.R. 88  (Revise), follows naturally fromthe policy of  re-establishing a strong  Navy  as  quickly as  appears  to   be practicable, without  resorting to emergency  measures in  relation to labour,  orto undue diversion of shipbuilding and  other  connected industrial activitiesfrom their normal channels.
