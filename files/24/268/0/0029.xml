    There is one point in connexion with the memorandum by theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence (CP.75 (37)) which shouldhe on record before a decision is taken.    Any proposal for the manufacture of calcium carbide in thiscountry must be based on the assumption that production here will he protected against foreign competition.  Imports ofcalcium carbide at present are worth about  600,000 of whichhalf comes from Norway.   (Norway sends us nearly 93$ of hercarbide exports).  The Anglo-Norwegian Trade Agreement of 1933provided for duty free entry of calcium carbide from Norway(in place of the 10 per cent, duty previously in force).    The Agreement also provided that Norway should purchase70$ of her coal requirements in this country.  As a result our exports of coal to that country have increased from  630,000in 1933 to  952,000 in 1936.    Any negotiations with the Norwegians for variation of theterms of the Agreement must be difficult in view of our desireto adjust the Scandinavian Agreements to accommodate our agricultural policy.   The Norwegians are known to attachconsiderable importance to the maintenance of free entry forcalcium carbide and if we now propose to protect a new industry for its production in this country,  it will be difficult orimpossible to secure more favourable treatment for our coal.W.R.ioard of Trade,  1st wlarch, 1937.Tfrs DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY Off HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVLRN&amp;IM;?-S50RET.CP,  79  (57),                                    COPY NO.    46_                            CABINET.
