COMMITTEE  OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.MEDITERRANEAN  AND RED  SEA PORTS : DEFENCES.  Memorandum by the Joint Oversea and Home Defence Sub-Committee of the                      Committee of Imperial Defence.    THE long-range policy on which the programmes for the modernisation ofdefended ports abroad are based is the Cabinet  decision* of 1934 to the effectthat: -         &apos;&apos; No expenditure need be incurred on measures of defence required to    provide exclusively against attack by the United States of America, France or    Italy, provided that defences are not allowed to fall so far behind that it will    be impossible to bring them up to a suitable standard in time to meet changes    in the political situation.&quot;    2.  In March 1936, the Committee of  Imperial Defencef  approved the JointOversea and Home Defence Committee&apos;s revised estimates:]: of the scales of possibleattack to which our defended ports abroad were liable.  In view of the change inour international relations with. Italy, which had taken place since  the  above-quoted decision was recorded by the Cabinet, these estimates included the scales of attack to which certain ports would be liable in the event of war with Italy.    3.  As a result, the scales of attack against Gibraltar and Malta now include&quot;bombardment raid by ships of the  line,&quot; whilst Haifa  and Port  Sudan are jclassified as defended ports.    4.  Proposals have since been put forward by the  Admiralty for increasingthe calibre of the counter-bombardment defences of Gibraltar and Malta, and theGovernor of Malta has forwarded proposals from the three Service Commandersfor augmenting the defences of Malta on a large scale.    5.  Not only  the defences of Gibraltar and Malta,  but  those of Aden,  Haifaand Port Sudan, rest largely upon the general policy of the Government as regardsmeasures of  defence  against attack by Italy.   The Joint Oversea and  HomeDefence  Committee feel that they cannot  usefully consider in detail proposalswhich involve such  very large expenditure until they have.&apos; received guidance asto the general policy that  should govern their recommendations in regard to thedefended&apos; ports in  the Mediterranean and the Red Sea.   They  therefore ask whether the Cabinet decision quoted in paragraph 1 still holds good, particularlyso far as Italy is concerned.                            (Signed)       V.

(5)-MEDITERRANEAN AND  RED SEA PORTS :  DEFENCES.                          (OLD. Paper No. 439-C.)  &apos;    (Previous reference :  OLD. Minutes of the 275th Meeting, Minute 2.)    THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Memorandum by &quot;the JointOversea  and Home  Defence  Sub-Committee asking for a ruling whether  theCabinet decision of  1934  that no expenditure need be incurred on  measures ofdefence required to provide exclusively against attack by  Italy,  still  stands(OLD. Paper No. 439-C).             &apos;              -    COLONEL  ISMAY, introducing  the Memorandum at the request  of  theChairman,  said that the Sub-Committee found it impossible to frame a policy for the modernisation of the Mediterranean and Red Sea, ports without guidance as to our defensive policy  vis-a-vis Italy.    SIR SAMUEL  HO ARE  thought  it  most necessary  to  give the Sub-Committee  guidance in this matter.  His own view was that it was impossibleto exclude the contingency of war with Italy.  Our  policy in the more distantpast had been correct.  We had  recognised then the great  importance  of  theMediterranean in our Imperial communications,  and had kept our bases anddefended ports in that area fully up to  date.   We had done this even when italy was a weak and a friendly power.  He felt  that  it was impossible to allow  the defences of Malta and Gibraltar to remain in their present inefficient condition.He did  not  think  it necessary  to embark immediately  on  any   very  greatexpenditure on these ports, but a start must be made on the modernisation ofthe defences.    MR.  ORMSBY GORE enquired what the position was with regard  to  theproposals for developing a base at  Cyprus.   This scheme would greatly  affectMalta and Haifa.    SIR MAURICE HANKEY  said  that the Joint  Planning Committee had submitted a Report on Cyprus to  the Chiefs of Staff,  who had referred it backto them again.  The expenditure involved in establishing a new base at Cypruswould be enormous.    MR.  CHAMBERLAIN enquired whether it would not be necessary to wait until the Chiefs of Staff  had reported on the Cyprus scheme.  He  thought itwould be unfortunate to signalise the conclusion of the Anglo-Italian agreement by installing 15-inch guns in the Mediterranean.    SIR ROBERT VANSITTART  said that  the Foreign Office view was that italy could only be considered a very uncertain friend.    SIR MAURICE HANKEY said that even after the assumptions as  to therisk of war with Italy had been decided, there remained a difficult technical issue.      [14631-4]
It was sometimes argued that since Malta was so very open to bombing attack,bombardment by ships of the line was much less probable, and that 15-inch guns were therefore unnecessary.    SIR SAMUEL HOARE said that opinion in Malta was much in  favour ofgreatly  increasing the strength  of  the counter-bombardment defences.   He  didnot think it necessary to wait for  the Chiefs of Staff  to report on the Cyprusscheme.  The  matter  resolved itself really into the  simple  question of whetheror not we were to make plans to meet the contingency of war with Italy.   nothing would be done at Malta and Gibraltar until this decision was reached.    MR. CHAMBERLAIN  suggested  that  there  were  two questions to be answered first, is Italy a reliable friend,  and second, if  she is an unreliablefriend,  how far is she unreliable ?    The answer to the second question would indicate whether it was worth while incurring enormous expenditure to guard against the possibility of being at  war  with her.  His-own personal  view wasthat, though Italy was an unreliable friend, the probability of her positive enmitywas small.  He thought, therefore, that it would be better to ascertain whatwould be the cost of  taking  defensive measures against her before making any decision to incur such cost.    SIR  SAMUEL  HOARE  agreed that Italy must be assumed  to be anuncertain  friend.  The Mediterranean was  a vital link in  our communications,and though he did not suggest any huge expenditure  on  the Mediterranean ports,he could not agree that we should go to the other extreme and do  nothing at alltp them.    MR. ORMSBY GORE suggested  that the whole situation  in the Mediter-ranean might  soon be entirely changed owing to events in  Spain.  He thought,therefore,  that we should delay taking any action at Gibraltar until we knew what its future was going to be.    SIR SAMUEL HOARE said he could not accept a policy of complete inactionin respect  of the Mediterranean ports, and urged that we  should revert to our previous policy of maintaining these ports at full efficiency.    MR. DUFF COOPER agreed.  He felt that the  vital importance  of  theMediterranean must be recognised,  but that Italy, though a possible enemy, wasnot a  probable one.   It  was  not therefore  desirable  to incur  very heavy expenditure on the defences of the Mediterranean ports.    SIR MAURICE  HANKEY pointed out that it was very difficult to translatesuch an expression into terms of guns.  There was a very big difference betweenthe cost of 9-2-inch and 15-inch guns.  He  drew attention  to the  proviso in theCabinet decision which was  now being discussed, namely, that  defences shouldnot be allowed to fall  so far behind  that it will be impossible to bring them up toa suitable standard in time to meet  changes  in the political  situation.    COLONEL ISM AY said that  very costly proposals for the improvement ofthe defences of Malta had been received from the  Governor,  and that it was partly  in connection  with these that the  Joint  Oversea and Home Defence Sub-Committee had asked for guidance.                           CONCLUSIONS.THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed (a)  To recommend     (1)  That Sub-Committees of the Committee of Imperial Defence should          base future inquiries in respect  of  the Mediterranean and Red          Sea defended ports on  the  following assumptions :            (i) The Mediterranean is a vital link in our Imperial communi-                 cations.          (ii) Italy cannot be counted on as a reliable friend, but in present                 circumstances need not be regarded as a probable enemy.
    (2) That in the above circumstances no very large expenditure should          be incurred on increasing the defences of these ports, but that at          the same time some steps should be taken to bring them  up to          date and to increase their efficiency.(b)  That in  view of the fact that these recommendations affected a previous       Cabinet decision, they should be submitted to the Cabinet.               -7P           TP           W          &quot;if&quot;           Vt&quot;2 Whitehall Gardens, S.
