Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.    I HAVE been asked to prepare a paper setting out the modifications in theplan proposed in  CP. 18 (37), which I outlined at the meeting of the D.P.R.Committee on the 4th February.  For convenience and brevity, I will refer (usingAir Ministry terminology) to the new plan contained in CP. 18 (37) as Scheme H,and to the existing approved plan to which we are  now working, and have been for the last twelve months, as Scheme F.    2.  Scheme H  was  designed  on the  assumption that  Germany  (aftercompleting a  first-line strength of  1,500 in April  1937) would proceed, by  afurther expansion  scheme, to reach a first-line strength of 2,500 in ApriL1939, ofwhich 1,700 would be bombers.  Scheme H was put forward as the best practicablecounter which it would be possible to provide, within the time available, againsta German expansion to those numbers.    3.  We have  to accept the fact  that the manufacturing capacity of theaircraft industry,  now in existence and under construction, will be taxed to theutmost to provide the aircraft required under Scheme F; and indeed the delivery of the full numbers  of aircraft  required under it will certainly not  be secureduntil  some months after April  1939.   But the aircraft to be ordered  under scheme F  provide not  only for the expansion of  our first-line Metropolitan,Overseas and Fleet Air  Arm  strengths,  but also for a  substantial  reserve.Scheme H accordingly proposed  that  the  additional  aircraft  required  for increasing  our first-line strength should be obtained by temporarily drawing onthis reserve, and that the gaps in the reserve should  be made good from aircraft to be  delivered in  1939 and 1940.    4.  The increase in first-line  strength under Scheme H would involve theconstruction of 13  new operational stations, for the housing of the 26  additionalsquadrons which the Scheme would,  on completion, provide.    5.  To attain  the first-line strength contemplated by Scheme H two further steps  would be necessary :  (a) the immediate incorporation in  first-line  units,from the day of mobilisation, of officers from Royal  Air Force Reserve;  (b) thetemporary  retention  at home of  10 squadrons which under Scheme F are to be formed for overseas by 1939.    6.  The Air  Staff have given  very careful  consideration to  the positionarising out of the information which I gave to the Cabinet on the 3rd February.We must face the fact that Germany could at short notice increase her programme      [14626]
 in the way indicated in C.I.D..  Paper 1265-B, on which Scheme H was based; and that in personnel, aircraft and manufacturing facilities, such an expansion would be  within  the  German capacity.   Taking all factors  into account  the Air Staff  consider that  our  best course  is to concentrate on  those  items  in Scheme H on which, unless action is now  taken, we should not be able to catch up if it later proved to be necessary to put the complete scheme into operation. On this basis the  principal requirements are as follows :      (1) First and foremost is the additional recruitment of those categories of           personnel (pilots and skilled tradesmen) who cannot be improvised at           short notice.   The personnel proposals for 1937-38  of Scheme F  as           set out in paragraph 12 of CP. 18 (37) should accordingly go forward           so far  as  the present training capacity  permits and subject to  a           reduction of 2,500 in the  number of &quot; other airmen.&quot;   This reduction           is legitimate, as unskilled men are easier to recruit and can be trained           much more  quickly than skilled men.  It should be recognised that the           actual  entry of the additional numbers  provided  for may  not  be           completed in the financial year 1937-38 and that some carry over of           their recruitment into 1938-39 may be necessary.     (2) The land required for the thirteen operational stations should be bought           and  levelled, but no buildings should be erected.     (3) Temporary buildings  should be  erected  to accommodate  any  extra           personnel trained in excess of the requirements of Scheme F.     7.   Under  this revised plan no  decision is asked for now as to the numbers of aircraft to be ordered for delivery after Scheme F is complete; nor,  again, is any present change required in the plans approved for forming new squadrons for overseas.     8.   The following is the  best estimate that can  be made of the cost of  the revised plan additional to that involved in Scheme F :      (1) Personnel            1937-38:  650,000.           1938-41: Approximately  1,000,000  in  1938, diminishing in later                years  and reaching parity with Scheme  F estimates  in 1940                or 1941.              &apos;     (2) Additional land and levelling for operational stations :   500,000.     (3) Temporary buildings :   250,000.         JNTOTE. A second  training school for apprentices  is, in any case,     necessary under Scheme F as the approved programme is beyond the capacity     of Ffalton; but any  further accommodation required  for  them under  the     Scheme for which  approval is now  sought would be met by  temporary     buildings.     9.   As regards the new Volunteer Reserve (CP. 18  (37)), actual provision to be made must depend on the extent of public response to the new scheme,  but it can be said at once  that, while the Air  Ministry would wish to use approved centres to  full capacity, if the pilots are forthcoming,  they do  not ask now  for any increase in the number of centres already contemplated, namely, 33.     10.  I ought, in conclusion, to mention one proposal which was referred to in Scheme Ff, namely, the provision of improved measures of defence for Northern Areas.   This matter is at present being considered by the Committee on the Air Defence of Great  Britain in conjunction with other proposals for strengthening our defences against air attack.  If the  C.I.D. approve this  proposal  it will necessitate the  formation of additional  bomber squadrons to take the  place of any auxiliary bomber  squadrons which would be converted to fighters for  the defence of the  Northern  Areas.  I  suggest, however, that this must be treated.as  a separate proposition and considered  when the Report of the Air Defence Committee comes  before the Committee of Imperial Defence.     11.  I submit this amended plan, as providing in the most economical way the best additional  insurance for air defence in relation to the means at our  disposal.                                                                       S.     Air Ministry,         February 11,  1937.
