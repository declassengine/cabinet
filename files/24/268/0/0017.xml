EGRET..P.   67(37)                          C A B I N B T.               EXPORTATION OF HORSES BILL, 1937.       Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture ,and Fisheries.                                                                       j       1.        On Friday, March 5th, the Exportation of Horses Bill,       introduced by Mr. E.A. Radford, will come before the House       of Commons for Second Reading, as the first Order of the day.       Similar Bills have been introduced by Private Members for       many  years past, but hitherto have failed to secure a       favourable place in the ballot.   It will be necessary for me       to announce the attitude of the Government towards the Bill,       and in  view of the strong agitation in its favour conducted       by various humanitarian Societies I feel that it is desirable  to       bring the facts of the matter to the notice of the Cabinet.       2.        In accordance with the provisions of the Diseases of       Animals Aet, 1910, and the Exportation of Horses Act, 1914,       horses  may not be exported from any port in Great Britain to       destinations on the Continent of Europe unless they are examined       at the  port of shipment by a Veterinary Inspector of the Ministry       of Agriculture and Fisheries and certified by him as fit to be       conveyed without cruelty and also to work without suffering.   The       standard of fitness required at the ports of shipment for horses       to be exported is high and above that of many horses working       in this country.   It precludes the shipment of any horse which       could be described as decrepit or worn-out.   I may say, in       parenthesis, that there is still much misunderstanding as to the       type  of horse which is now being exported from this country.   So       far as  the administration of the present Acts is  concerned it       is generally recognised that they have been and are being       enforced rigidly and efficiently^   in this respect there has       been  no change from the conditions reported on by the copy NO.33&quot;
Departmental Committee on the Exportation of Horses  to  theContinent in 1925 (Cmd. 2495).   The high standard of  fitnessrequired for export is well known amongst those engaged in  thetrade;  this is shown by the fact that there is a  very small percentage of rejections.   In 1936 of the 3,181 horsespresented for shipment only 47 were rejected.   Any horsepresented which appears to the Inspector to be unfit to bekept alive is immediately slaughtered by his directionwi th out c ompens a ti on.3.        Mr. Radford&apos;s Bill, of which I have received an advancecopy, proposes to amend the existing law by prohibiting theexport of all horses and asses unless certified by aveterinary inspector in his opinion to be -     (a)  Not more than eight years of age, and     (b)  Of not less value than -          (i)  25 in the case of a horse of 14 hands and over;         (ii)  10 for a horse under 14 hands;  and        (iii)  3 for an ass.4.        Certain exceptions are proposed to allow for  thecontinued export of horses intended for racing,  breeding,showing, hunting, polo, and remounts, provided their value is not less than  25 and they are accompanied by acertificate from the Jockey Club or an approved breed  society.5.        The declared object of the promoters of  the Bill  isto stop the export of horses intended for slaughter, or whichwill be slaughtered after a period of further work abroad,on the ground that the treatment of ordinary working horsesand methods of slaughter in many European countries  are wellbelow British standards.   Under the existing law  nodeclaration is required of the purpose for which horses areexported, but from information obtained by the Ministry&apos;sinspectors from shippers, the number intended for  immediate
slaughter on arrival was 21 out of a total export of 2,670 horses!                                                                  Iin 1935, and 16 out of 3,134 in 1936,,   All the horses for        fslaughter sent to Holland where the use of the humane killer      jis compulsory,,   The hull: of the horse flesh obtained by          jContinental countries from the United Kingdom already crossesin carcase form,  the numbers of carcases exported In the lasttwo years for which figures are available being: -              1934      24,057              1935      22,571Moreover out of a total of 3,134 live horses exported to theContinent in 1936 78fo were declared by the owners to bevalued per head at  50 and over and a further 10$ at between 25 and  50, while of 361 under  25,  60;i were Shetland ponies. .The percentages in the previous year were similar.   Thesefigures indicate that the trade in horses intended for human consumption is already a dead meat trad.e, and thatthe bulk of the live horses are of considerable value.There is little complaint about the conditions of transitby sea which are governed by strict regulations supervisedby my Department,  and in point of fact casualties on thesea journey are negligible.                                   -6.        The provisions of the Bill are quite illogical,for whatever the purpose of export and whatever the exportvalue, it is more than probable that horses shipped to europe will eventually be slaughtered abroad for human food.Such an end cannot be prevented unless the export of horsesis prohibited entirely.7-        In my opinion the case for further legislation cannotbe substantiated,  and there are serious practical difficultiesin carrying out a measure on the lines proposed, particularlyin the determination of value and the issue of certificates of exemption.   I must, however, warn my colleagues that there
ISOis a strong sentiment, largely based on misconception,  insupport of the Bill both within the House of Commons and among the electorate, and it is quite likely that theSecond Reading will be carried.   In spite of this I considethat the Government should not support the Bill and thatI should be authorised to take this line in the Debate.There is an amendment on the paper to remit the Bill to  a select Committee and, seeing that the last inquiry tookplace 12 years ago, I should propose, if the trend of the debate renders it desirable, to advocate such a course.                          (Intld.)  W.S.M.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries,    10, Whitehall Place,        S   1. 19th February,  1937.
