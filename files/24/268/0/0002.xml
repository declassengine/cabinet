(intld.) M.M.5th February, 1937.
&apos;p-o the United Kingdom High C-ommissloners in Canada, Commonwealthof Australia, Union of South Africa and Governor-GeneraHew Zealand.,               Sent 11,30 p,m, 2nd February, 1937         His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom havevary carefully considered the situation resulting from thepassage of the recent legislation in the Irish Free Statefollowing upon the abdication of King Edward VIII and they feelthat a ;/.tage has been reached when they should give HisMajesty&apos;&apos;&apos;s other Governments an account of the position as they see it,  Mrl de Valera has told us that he does not intend tomfoxmi the other Dominion Governments of the legislation,, as inbis view it does not make any fundamental alteration in theexisting position regarding the Free state &apos; s relationship tothe British Commonwealth of Nations, and that therefore suchprocedure is not required-,  But he has readily agreed that weshould communicate to the other Dominion Governments whateverinformation and views we may think desirable on the matter. Thelegislation does make material alterations in the -constitution of the Irish Free State., as described below, - and inour view the changes are sufficiently important to warrantconsideration by His Majesty&apos;s other Governments as to theirpossible effect on the Irish Free State&quot;s relationship to theBritish Commonwealth of NationsB   B,    Before giving an account of the actual legislation,, Ishould refer to the events leading up to its enactment*  InJune last the Irish Free State Government informed us informally&quot;as a matter of courtesy&quot; of a communication which they had addressed to the King, announcing their intention of                                             introducing
introducing- legislation to set up a new Constitution in the IrishFree State.   They told us that the communication intimated thatthe changes would&quot;&quot;concern only the internal affairs of the FreeState,; leaving unaffected the constitutional usages relating toexternal affairs. Amongst the new provisions would he the creationof the office of a President, elected by the people, and theabolition of the Office of Goveraor-general,   3.    At the time when this information was received., theGovernment- here had already for some time been examining thepossibility of initiating informal discussions with the IrishFree State Government with a view to endeavouring to reach asolution ox the outstanding questions at issue between the twocountries.   Consequexxtly, in replying to Mr... de Valera8 communication we let him know that we were reviewing the wholequestion of relations between the two countries, and that assoon as our rsview was complete we would propose preliminary discussions between officials from both sides to see whether abasis for agreement could be found.   4B    Informal discussions covering various outstanding questions took place between officials during the autumn but little progress was made.  In the course of these Mr,;. de Yalerainformed us that he proposed at about the time when he introduced his new Constitution Bill to introduce also a bill dealing with the Free State-s external affairs, in which its relation to the British Commonwealth of Natioxis would be definedaHe let us know that the King&apos;s functions regarding the external affairs of the Irish Free State would be confirmed in that Bill,,He also told us that he intended in advance of the publication ofthe  two Bills to communicate their terms informally,, as a matterof courtesy? to the United Kingdom and the other DominionGovernmentso
   50    But &quot;before, effect could &quot;be given to this intentionthe events connected with the abdication of King Edward VIIIoccurred, and as a result Mr. de Valera without any furtherprevious consultation introduced in to the Dail, and secured theimmediate passage of, two Bills dealing with this matter.   6a    The first of these Acts amends the existing constitution, and except for the clause quoted below deals whollywith the internal government of the Irish Free State.   Weunderstand from Mr,, de Valera that this is a temporary measure,and that he intends as early as possible to replace it and theexisting Constitution by the new Constitutional legislation whichhe has been preparing for some time and which was foreshadowed inhis communication to the King last- June.  The recent amendingAct leaves untouched Article 1 of the existing Constitution,which states that &quot;the Irish Free State is a co-equal member of theCommunity of nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations&apos;.&apos;,but deletes all references in the Constitution to the King andthe representative of the Crown, except that Article 51 of theConstitution is amended to read as follows:-       &quot;There shall be a Council, to exercise the executive authority and Power of the Irish Free State (Saorstat Eireann)to be styled the Executive Council.   Provided that it shall belawful for the Executive Council to the extent and subject toany condition which may be determined by law to avail for thepurposes of the appointment of diplomatic and consular agentsaxid the  conclusion of international agreements of any organ used as a constitutional organ for the like purposes by any of thenations  referred to in Article 1 of this Constitution.   TheExecutive Council shall be responsible to Dail Eireann, and shallconsist  of not more than twelve nor less than five Ministersappointed in the manner hereinafter provided.&quot;    The King&quot;s                                                      functions
functions in internal affairs (performed for him by theGovernor-General) are thus all abolished;  they will be performed partly by the Speaker of the Dail and partly by thePresident of the Executive Council,,   70    The second Act, the text of which is contained in my                              ximmediately succeeding telegram, regularises in  the Free state the position resulting from King Edward VIII&apos;s abdication and provides for the execution by the King of certain functions  inrelation to the external affairs of the Irish -Free State.Mr. de Yalera tells us that when his new constj.tutionallegislation referred to in the preceding paragraph is passed this  second Act will still remain on the Statute Book as a sort of partner to that legislation,   8c    Further light was thrown on the position byMr. de Valera&apos;1 s  speeches in the Dail debates at  the time whenthe legislation was  introduced, and also by  conversations whichI had with him subsequently in London,,   From  these thefollowing information as to his views  and  intentions  emerges:-    (a)   The  legislation does not affect the King&apos;s title0         His Majesty is still &quot;King of Great Britain.;, Ireland         and  the British Dominions beyond  the  Seas, Defender         of the  Faithj,  Emperor  of Indiao&quot;    (b)   Although  the King  (or  his representative)  ceases  to         perform any functions  in the  internal affairs  of  the         Irish Free  States  it  is  as &quot;King  of Great Britain,          Ireland and the British Dominions beyond  the Seas,etc,          that B,ie,  Majesty will  continue  to perform functions          regarding the  Irish Free  State&apos;&apos;s  external affairsc.    (c)    The  functions  specifically mentioned in the          legislation (&amp;.$..  appointnient of consular and          diplomatic representatives,  and the conclusion of                                               Internationale^Mitedl   the text&apos; ot the Act  is  set  out aB  Annex  II  to
INTERNATIONAL onal ttreaties)  are not intended to be an exclusive list.under the words &quot;all other if anypurposes&quot;in Clause 3(2)  of the Sxterna1 Relations Act      His  Majesty will continue  to perform any other      constitutional functions which he  would have  performed      for  the  Irish Free  State before the Act was passed,  and      which he continues  to perform for  the other members  of      the  C ommonwealt h,(d)    So long  as the other Members of the Commonwealth wish      to retain the Crown as the symbol  of their association,,      and so long as the  Irish Free State remains a itemiser of      the Commonwealth,  the Irish Free State will recognise      the Crown as the symbol of its association also(o)    Mr,  de Talera does  not. intend to include in the proposed      new Constitutional  legislation (which will replace the      existing Constitution and  the present Act amending it)      Article I of the existing  Constitution, which declares     t that &quot;the Irish Free State is a co-equal member of the      Community of Nations forming the British Commonwealthbecause he intends that the Free State should cease tobe a full member of the Commonwealth (which he doesnot), but because he gave a pledge to his supporterssome time ago that- the new Constitution Bill dealingwith internal affairs would be so drawn that it wouldnot itself require amendment if the Free State everdesired to sever its connection with the commonwealth and to&apos; become a Republic.  In his view the external relations Act defines sufficiently the position of theIrish Free State as a member of the Commonwealth-The Cabinet, have now considered the position, bearing that mind two fundamental considerations (1)  the importance of doing everything which can properly be done to facilitate whole-                                                       heartedof BationSoHe explained to me that this is not
hearted co-operation between the Members of the BritishCommonwealth and (2) the necessity of maintaining the essentialprinciples of the association between the nations of the-Commonwealth which constitute its special character ana justifythese nations in extending advantages to one another which theydo not extend to nations outside the British Commonwealths  Itseems to His Majesty&apos;1 s Government in the United Kingdom that recognition of the Crown is one of these essential principles.Otherwise, for example, Imperial Preferences might no longer bejustified in the light of existing most-favoured-nationprovisions in commercial treaties,.   3.0c   In our view the question whether this legislationaffects the Irish Free State8 s relationship to the Commonwealthof &quot;Nations is a matter of concern to all the Members of theCommonwealths, and therefore we decided that we could not  reach a final conclusion  on the position until after communication and  consultation with the other Dominion Governments*   Buthearing studied the  new Irish Free State constitutional proposals and  MrQ de Valex*a&apos;J.s  observations on  them we have reached  the tentative conclusion that, while we  regret that  these proposalsinvolved  the disappearance of  constitutional forms  in relationto the King which are employed by the  other Members of theCommonwealths we should be prepared  to  treat, the proposals  as not  effecting a fundamental  alteration  in  the  position of theIrish Free State as a Member  of  the  Commonwealth,,    11o    At  the same time, although  Mr.  de Valera&apos;sexplanations have greatly  clarified  the position,  the wording of  the legislation  itself  does not appear  to us  to make  certain important points sufficiently clear, and we would  propose forour part  to  urge upon Mr.  de Valera  certain  points  in  order tomake plain in  the  legislative  documents the  Irish  Free State3 sfull membership  of  the  Commonwealth  and recognition of  the                                                     King
King as the symbol ox its association with the other members.This seems to us important, if the special nature of our association is to be maintained and we are to avoid the risk ofthe special advantages which we accord to each other beingChallenged by some foreign government0   The points which wewould urge are   fa)   Article 1 of the present Constitution - or its         equivalent - should be included in the proposed new         Constitution,   If this is impracticable for the         reason which backward de Yalera has given,, he should inclxzde         it as an additional clause to his External Relations         Act,,  We attach particular importance to this.   (b)   The words &quot;symbol of their co-operation&quot; in         Section 3 (1) of the External -Relations Act might be         read to mean that whilst the King is recognised as the         symbol of co-operation between the other Members of         the Commonwealth, he is not recognised by the Irish         Free State as the symbol of its co-operation also., It         is desirable, that it should be made clear that the         Irish Free State do recognise him as the symbol of         their co-operation with &quot;the other Members of the         C ommonw e alth *   (o)   The use of the word &quot;organ&quot; to describe the King in the         amendment to Article 51 of the existing Constitution.         seems to us unfortunate., especially as this Article         forms the only link between the Constitution and the         Ebcteraal Relations Ac to   In order to make the position         clear, It would seem desirable that the Article should         be reworded so as to make specific reference to the         King,,   12*   The above are our present views on the position.Please communicate the terms of this telegram to the Prime                                                   Minister
Minister,   &quot;e should be glad to know whether in his and hiscolleagues *  view the Irish Free State Constitutional proposals as described above should or should not be treated aseffecting a fundamental alteration in the position of theIrish Free State as a member of the British Commonwealth ofIf at i oixs c.   13,,   I am sending this message also to our high commissioners ia the other Dominions (and to the governor general of New Zealand)a        ( )  delete in telegram to New Zealand.
