Paraphrase of telegram from&apos; the - Secretary&quot; of State for the Colonies to the Governor General of the Union of South Africa.(Sent, 9.40 p.m. 12th August, 1919.)12th August.   Urgent.I regret to note from your telegram 11th August that it has not been found possible to convene Union Parliament as coon as was expected when.you telegraphed on the 6th August. Severe pressure is being put upon us from Paris to ratify Treaty at earliest possible date and French ratification expected September 2nd or September 3rd.   Matter is thus very urgent.,: Australian Parliament is now in session so that matter can be taken in hand immediately on arrival of Hughes. Canadian Parliament will meet 1st September,, and I understand that New Zealand Parliament will meet, immediately.   I hope that in these circumstances procedure by joint Resolutionwill be adopted as suggested by my telegram 7th August, in- -  - s.....&apos; &apos;   - ft.     -order to avoid.any delay that might b* Incurred whileParliamentary,powers to axocute Treaty are being obtained.If this procedure adopted I assume that your Government willhave no objection to His Majesty being advised to ratifyimmediately we receive cable to Sffeot that such Resolutionhas been passed and I ;am communicating in same sense withother Dominion Governments ..MILWE .
PiRAPHRASB OF TELSGIUM&quot; from the &quot;Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governor General of theJ&amp;ommonw^t^ (Sent 7,40 pcm. 12th August, 1919.)12th August.  Urgent,In continuation of my telegram 7th August I have been asked by Government of Union of South Africa, whioh has con-    f intervened special session of Parliament to consider Peace Treaty with Germany and is of opinion that it will be very desirable to secure uniformity in dealing with this question, to submit suggestions as to the form in which Peace Treaty should receive Parliamentary approval in Dominions, iee* whether approval should take the form of a Bill on lines of that submitted to Parliament here or of motion submitted to Parliament for that purpose,,    I have replied to effect that matter is of course one for decision of local Government but that best course in my opinion would be to obtain approval of Treaty by resolution of both houses and that if as is probable legislation on lines of British Bill is required in order to give effect to Treaty this could follow later.    It is important to bear in mind that the British Bill is not a Bill to ratify the Peace Treaty, but to empower the Government to take necessary steps to carry out those provisions of the Treaty which require Legislative authority.My reason for suggesting Resolution of both Houses is that this procedure might enable ratification to take place without the delay that might be involved in obtaining parliamentary powers for carrying out the Treaty.    I should be grateful if you will inform me what procedure will be adopted by your Government.    If as I hope procedure by Resolution is adopted I assQme that there will be no objection to His Majesty ratifying immediately we receive cable to effect that such Resolution has been passed and I have telegraphed to other Dominions in same sense,MILNSR..
