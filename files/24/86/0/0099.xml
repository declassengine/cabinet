Whether the Polioe strike was eally wa attempt at revolution or not, it has oertainly been an acid r est of the strength of the extremists and the result is reassuring,Ibe extremists have reoeived a further blow in the decision of ihe Triple Industrial Alliance to postpone the ballot on &quot;direct lotion&quot;.    This is a striking illustration of the truth that the lommon sense of the British working man can always be trusted when he pows the faots.The partial settlement of the bakers&apos; strike and the impending Iiettlement of the Yorkshire Miners&apos; dispute contribute to more settled oonditlons.The outstanding oauses of discontent are high prices and laok of lousing.    If people had an oooular demonstration of the beginning of txtensive house building, they would oheerfully submit to their present discomfort.Particulars are given of the international swindler, John de Kay, who has contrived to deoeive the British Socialist leaders who jkave gone to Switzerland for international meetings,Nationalisation seems likely to be the next question that will Ibe used for fomenting unrest.
English)THE PQLIC13 STRIKE - 5*53The strike having definitely broken down, its promoters are devoting their energies to obtaining reinstatement of the strikers.   Half-hearted meetings are still being held on Tower Hill and elsewhere, and the Union offioials hint at a disagreeable surprise-for the Government if their demands are not conceded,   public interest is, however, dying down.The strike did not extend vary far in the Prison Service, Sixty-six warders (about half the staff) at Wormwood Sorubs came out, but many of these had been deluded into the belief that the strike would be general.   Eenshaw, a clerk and school-master warder at Pentonville,and other agitators of that Prison, who had worked up the unrest, deserted their followers at the last moment and spoke against a strike.   a better spirit has already been noted among the Metropolitan Polioe, rThe efforts of Tom Mann to provoke a general strike in Liverpool have failed, and he has lost whatever influence he had over the more stable working men, who know him to be a paid agent.   A Liverpool engineer recently remarked that he supposed that kann would reoeive another  500 for his servioes.The working men at Woolwioh showed sympathy with the strikers, and at one meeting pledged themselves to support the Union,   An inflammatory speech was made by an ex-Lieut, of the Royal Air Force on august 10th, in which he roundly abused the Commissioner of Polioe.On the whole, the Police seem to be satisfied with the Polioe Act, and in many districts they do not wish to have a Union.I have been making enquiries about Police Unions in the United States.   There appears to be no uniformity: in some cities Polioe organizations exist, in others they have never been/
(English)been thought of, while in a few they are actually forbidden &apos; by law;&quot; - .    v4i&apos;;z-P0V/E1R OF THE POLICE ^The Press has been much exercised during the week over the case of Zaohoriassen, the young Norwegian who brought money from Sweden to kiss Sylvia Pankhurst.   There has been a shower of secretly printed revolutionary leaflets and the raids, whioh are a matter of routine in suoh oases, have been fully reported in the press with sensational additions,The public in consequence are wondering why no drastio action follows these disclosures.The answer is simple.   In the present state of the law it is no offence to be in possession of revolutionary literature nor.to belong bo a revolutionary society.   When, therefore, the Polioe find revolutionary leaflets in a printer&apos;s shop, they can take.no action beyond confiscating the leaflets and seizing the press, and this they can only do under the Defence of the Realm Regulations.   When these are repealed they will not even have that power.If the polioe decide to wait until the leaflets are distributed the printer invariably destroys all evidence of the work and it would be futile to raid his premises.In the United States and Canada very drastio legislatio is being introduced under which it will be an offence to be in possession of revolutionary matter, or to belong to a revolutionary society.   Short of this it is not easy to see how the inoulcation of revolutionary ideas is to be dealt with,, exoept by oounter propaganda and this is being seriously undertaken by outside agenoies with whom this office is in touch.THE. COAL QUESTION. .....fThe end of the strike in the Yorkshire coalfields isnow/
(English) - 3 - 5&apos;$,now definitely in sight.    The Council of the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Association decided at a oonferenoe in Bornsley on August 12th to reooamend the strikers to resume work.    It is practically certain that this advice will be followed.Ihough the assistant Seoretary, Roebuck, is an extremist, and attempts were made at one time to give a politioal colour to the dispute, the strike has throughout been industrial.     Herbert Smith has no revolutionary tendency, and he retains the confidence of his men,dSielaokof oo-operation between the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain,and the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Association is likely to cause friction between the two bodies for some time.m triples xmmsbulxubwm m direct action .&apos;At the Conference of the Triple Alliance on August 12th, it was deoided tc postpone the ballot on &quot;Dlreot Aotion It was given out that this decision was due tc &quot;the changed attitude of the Government towards the proposals of the Triple Alliance&quot;, but it iff more probable that the real Cause was the change of feeling which has undoubtedly taken place amongst the rank and file of the oomponent unions, as well as to the attitude of leaders such as Mr. J.H. Thomas, m.P. , Mr. W\ Brace, M.P., and Mr, Sexton, M.P.    As has been reported, there has been recently a remarked revulsion of  &apos;; feeling amongst miners in South Males; many Transport workers have shown considerable aversion from direct aotion and the; railwaymen in several districts have expressed the opinion that they should be allowed to ballot.For some: time it has been clear that on the question of Intervention In Russia the extremists have been flogging a dead horse; it is probable that they will now seek another oaaua, belli, and if, as seems probable, this should prove to be nationalization, the struggle may be more serious.But/
But every abortive attempt to foment.a strike has,the effect of steadying labour in the particular industry,for some time, The conference of delegates, ;the date for whioh has not been fixed, will probably draw up another platform.for the , ] Alliance.,TW COST office LIVIliQ     &apos; :&quot;r(i&quot; /-&apos;--&apos;High prices remain one of the chief causes of unrest and, if there is any sCaroity of  oodVthe position will atonce become serious.   The prioe of milk t  the subjeot of much dissatisfaction, especially in Yorkshire.&apos;The Profiteering Bill has hot been very well&apos;reoeived.The most important objections raised by the*labouringclasses ore;- :(1)   That the 8;3ail trader will be victimised and that the big people oonoemed&apos;in monopolies or trustsv: - -ms.        , will escape, &apos;. ..,    ,:;/;(2)   That interested people will secure representation on local tribunals,THIS HQbTS Ii-IG - &amp;U33T I OH    .^correspondents, report that there is still much discontent in regard to the housing problem., and,labour generally seems? inclined * to,-apply... its panacea, - nationaliza-tion -, to the building industry. ; It is helieyed that speculators. are obstructing building and, that; unless the State controls all building materials, as well as the finished houses, the supply of dwellings will be kept - permanently-bishind the demand.^ r,;.:.\.,-   mch of this suspicion would be dispelled if people could see the foundations of the new houses/actually laid. k :     p   i J2i informed that there is considerable; outcry in the &apos; -;iieed8:: a^ea-^regarding&apos;- tbe^ereotloa of Kinematograph: Theatres instead of houses\  At Dewsbury itiwas proposed to pull do twelve&quot; substantial houses in order to erect:a Kinematograpl^ Theatre.   At doncaster also there has been:much heateddiscussion/
(English) rdisouaaion beoauae the Corporation proposes to sell public - land, for: the.erection of a private enterprise faotory.-The Independent Labour Party and the .Dr,ily Herald&apos; have worked up some degree of feeling on what they call &quot;the restoration of the liapaburg Dynasty in Hungary.&quot;  They are curiously silent about the oollapse of the Communist regime, and profess to be sceptical about any reports on the terrorism of Bela Kun*s last few weeks of power.ACmCULTUfolL LABOURERS-There is unrest among the iigrioultural Workers in Nottinghamshire^,,who allege that they are grossly underpaid, and that the farmers are oharging them extortionate rents for insanitary houses.   There are hints of a strike during harves time.   The Independent Labour Party is reported to be behind the agitation.THE FEELING -AMONGST DISCilAHM) 3QLDISB3The slight improvement in the temper of discharged men, reported last week, has been maintained and there have been fewer adverse reports.The Nottingham Branch of the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilized Sailors and Soldiers is loyal and various members have severely heckled extremist speakers at recent meetings.   At Newcastle,when a Leeds Sooialist named Jackson hod been extolling Lenin and Trotsky in an open-air meeting,a one-armed soldier mounted the platform and assaulted him and the meeting was broken up.   There is, however, a oertain amount of bitterness towards the &quot;Comrades of the Great War&quot; who ore alleged to receive Government support and unfair assistance in the distribution of their literature amongst soldiers about to be demobilised..;v/1
&apos; X number ht men in the Leeds district are seoeding from &apos; their societies.   They aoy that they p,re disheartened arid . ;.: disgusted by their treatment at the hands of the Government . and of the rogues who control their organizations.On August 9th disoharged men in Swansea hold a large demonstration^ Resolutions were passed whioh condemned profiteering, asked for an amnesty for military and naval prisoners and urged the Government lo find employment for all ex-Service men and to exert pressure oh the Civil Liabilities Committee for the expedition of-, grants. . 1The Bradford Branch of the National Federation of Discharged and &quot;Demobilized Sailors and Soldiers has applied for affiliation to &quot;the Labour Party.SOVIETS IN ENGLANDThere is again some talk among the extremists of revivinSoviets in England.   David Ramsey, lately released from prisoin London,is in charge of the movement/and at..(^yan oiv-August 2nd, pi are reported to have been made for Bdotland.   In Glasgow ther has been V secret aitempt to enrol volunteers for the &quot;Red i further investigations are being mode. j .: THE NATIONAL UNION OF railway&amp;TO2NThere is a cleavage in the ranks of the National Union o Railwayman,   It was made olear at the annual conference in J that there is a high percentage of extremist delegates, and there are signs, not amounting, a3 yet, to evidence, that certain underground influences are at work within the organization.  These elements, however, entertain a wholesom-       dread... of.-Mr, J.H. ^homas, M.P., and it is quite possible the :r  their efforts will be as abortive as was the recent strike of the&apos; London and South - Western, Railway&apos;men.&apos;   Certain/
(English)- 7mMtmmmmMmmmmmBmmCertain re-arrangements in tho chief offices of the National Union of Railwaymen are contemplated.It is reported that Mr. J.H. Thomas, M.P., will devote himself more particularly to the formulation of polioy and to the broader lines of union administration, and that the President, kr, 0,T. Cramp, will take the position of assistant secretary.ilr. Thomaa is a clone friend of jt$, Herbert Smith, of the Yorkshire Miners1 Association, &amp;nd it is thought that these two leaders are endeavouring to counteract the influence of .i*r, Smillie.   Mr. Thomas is diBS&amp;tlsfied with the preponderance of the miners in the Triple Industrial -Alliance and there are signs tfcat he atay wish the National Union of Railwayaen to withdraw from that organization.The Herald League has fallen upon evil days in as far as/ipen air meetings are concerned.   On August 10th two meetings in Hyde Ba,rk attracted very small audienoes and smaller collections, biiu a good deal of heokling.On August 10th a aeeting at Peokham Jtye was addressed by Victor Beecham and -dse 0&apos;NeiU,   A Sergeant in the Middlesex Regiment, having asked leave to mount the platform, denounced the extremists in unmeasured terms.   He was heartily applauded by the majority of the audience.MISS SYLVIA Pj^KHURSTAlways distinguished for venom rather than for veracity, Miss Sylvia Pankhurst has made one of the worst blunders in her career.   In &quot;The Daily Herald&quot; of 18.7,19,, she denied thi.it she had received money for The Peopled Russian Information Bureau, and has, more recently, denied in the press that she received money for any purpose whatsoever.She/
(English) - 8 -She now states, in &quot;-&quot;The Daily Herald&quot; of August 12th:-   &quot;I have had many friends among Swedish Socialists ever sinoe .........,. .1913.     And&apos; &quot;they have always taken a great interest in the &quot;Dreadnought&quot;.    They sent me over  280 to help the paper,&apos;   &quot;Zaohariasseri brought it.    Why there shou have been any mystery I oouldn*-t-make out.    But I gathered that for personal - apparently for family - reasons, he didn&apos;t want it known.    And I thought it unfair to divulge what I regarded as his personal affair.&quot;Miss Pankliurst forgot to mention that Zachariassen is in close touch with Frederick STr6m, the editor of Folkets Dagblad Politiken.    Strom is a notorious Bolshevik agent and was entrusted with the interests of the Soviet Government when Vorovsky left Stockholm.DAVID KIRKWOOD.Since his release from prison in July, David Kirkwood has made a series of speeches in various parts of the country, which might be considered the ravings of a lunatioj if they were not part of a deliberate campaign of revolutloj Extracts from speeches made at Pontycymmer on August  j 3rd are typical:- j&quot;I know the Defence of the Realm quite well.    I have I been dei^ingit and I am going to defy it to-day.    The present Government 13 the most blood-thirsty lot of wasters!imaginable and Lloyd George....... is known on the Clydeas &quot;Dirty David&apos;.    He is a waster, and a liar.......

I am out to cause disoontent amongst the workergto bring about revolution.There are to be no more Kings.&quot; IREVOLUTIONARY/1
(English)9 -My correspondent lays stress upon the need for instruction in elementary economics in Nottinghamshire.    He is very much impressed by the methods of the local Sooialist Labour Party.    This party has organized classes for the instruction of revolutionary speakers at the William Morris Institute.    A oourse of instruction in Marxian eoonomics has been skilfully organised and graded, and my correspondent is of opinion that anyone who absorbs the teaching, as a workman with no previous knowledge of eoonomios probably would, must beoome a pronounoed revolutionary.    This movement is undoubtedly part of John Maclean&apos;s educational campaign, and is on a par with the Rand School of Sooial Soienoe in america,    In this oonneotion it is interesting to note that a new bookshop has been opened at 109, Devonshire Street, Sheffield, for &quot;propaganda purposes&quot;.The Reform Bookshop (Labour Institute Ltd.), Bradford, one of the main distributing centres of revolutionary propaganda, has again increased its capital,    The company was formed In 1897 with a oapital of  5,000, and two of the ohief shareholders at that time were Mrs. Besant and Mr. Jowett, ex-M.P.    In 1917 the oapital was inoreased to  7,000 and in June, 1919, there was a further increase. Mortgages upon the Labour Institute, largely held by Yorkshir^ Trade Unions, are  6,000,  2,500 and  300.PERNICIOUS LEAFLETS. !Extremists seem to be reverting to their old praotioe of putting, the name of a bogus printing firm on leaflets.The leaflet.  &quot;British Workers    Vftiat are we going to do?&quot; bears the name of the &quot;New&quot; Press, Princes Street, Edinburgh.    Investigation proves that the &quot;New&quot; Press does not exist, but that the leaflet was printed in London.Unfortunately the printer destroyed all traoes of thework/
*** Sfll(jangllBh)- - 10 -work as soon as he had. executed it and a search of his premises&quot; would.have been useless.        ,    - ^a similar,case is that of the leaflet &quot;Soldiers -&apos;   Comrades!   Where are you going to?&quot;    This bears the words &quot;Printed :by the ^Progress&apos; Publishing Co., New York, U.3.A.&apos; Apart from the faot that the phraseology and spelling are distinotly British, enquiries prove that the only &quot;Progress Publishing Company&quot; in the States is in Boston.    this leaflet also is believed to have been printed in London,RAIDS.On August 9th a raid was made on a room in Acton occupied by L.S. Tate, a member of the Socialist Party of Great Britain, of the Herald League and of the Workers&apos; Union.A quantity of literature was seized including oopies of the leaflet &quot;British Workers - what are we going to do?^ the &quot;lev/1 Press , Prinoes Street, Sdinburgh, to whioh reference was made in the House of Commons on August 7th.This leaflet has been plaoed on the list of Hostile Leaflets.and whenever found will be destroyed under Regulation 51 of the Defenoe of the Realm Regulations.In view of the faot that there were several oopies of most of the pamphlets, it seems clear that Tate has acted as a distributing agent for propaganda.A raid was made on 7, Featherstone Buildings, the headquarters of the London Workers1 Committee, on August 11th and a quantity of literature seized,BRITISH SOCIALISTS ABROAD AND JOHN Dfi KAY.. Mr, Ramsay Maodonald, Mr, George Lansbury and Mr. and &apos; Mrs. Snowden appear.&apos; to have been entirely taken in by the international swindler John de Kay.    This man, who has been referred to in previous reports, is an Meridan adventurer,who/
(Engliah) - IX - r,0J y qwho has been involved in doubtful transactions in Mexico, and was charged in 1916 with defrauding the Belgian Government.    He makes a hobby of extreme Socialism and liasIf&apos;/;&apos;.written two books on the subjeot, &quot;The World Allies&quot; and &quot;Women and the New Social State&quot;.    The Independent Labour . Party has lately issued the 9th chapter of the latter as *   their Pamphlet Ho. 18.   Be Kay paid the expenses of some of the delegates to the Berne meeting of the Internationale,Last March ho endeavoured to obtain a sum of money from the German Government for propaganda in England, Prance and Italy.    This plan was frustrated by Kuehlon, the former director of iCrupp&apos;s, who considers de Kay to be an unprincipled man.    In the Press of the 29th July, de Kay has made a public offer to the .Aotion Branoaise1 to pay 50,000 francs to any charity if it can be proved that he has received any money from the German Government, or from any German institution or parson.    It is a perfectly safe offer, under the oiroumstanoes.Be Kay1 s actual financial position is as follows :-The British Commercial Bank hold Mexican 6$ Gold Bonds, Series UC&quot; 1913* valued at  158,500.  Their correspondents in New York hold 427,000 dollars worth of Mexican National Packing Company1 s Bonds, as seourlty against money owing by John de Kay to the Bank,    On the other hand, de Kay owes a considerable sum (over  6,000) to the Bank.He Is carrying on an agitation whioh is dangerous because he has persuaded Socialist Leaders in various oountries to believe that he is disinterested.IRELAND.The most noteworthy event is the recent outbreak of lawlessness in County Clare, no less than four organized * attacks on the Polioe and two murders of Polioe having taken place.

Dublin on the 30th July, Leteotive Sergeant Smith wan fired at by five men. and dangerously wounded,   ^It is rather unfortunate that the Military Authorities have not been able to spare troops for proteoting the Barraoks.    It has consequently, been necessary to close 28 Police Barraoks in Clare and about 15 in the distriots adjoining that County.    This is exactly what- was wanted by the extremists, and. it is to be feared that attacks on Poll Barraoks and th e. murder of Policemen who are doing their du may spread,..     v. :     &quot;.   4 new method of smuggling rifles into the oountry has oome under notice.
