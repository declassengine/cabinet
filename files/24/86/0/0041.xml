From Viceroy, Foreign Department, 1th August 1919.   1 (Received 10 p.m.)11-10 S. Secret. Afghanistan. Following from Baluchistan, 6th August:  &quot; Letters from Ali Ahmad to Abdul urging withdrawal of his forces to distance of .10 miles were forwarded with letter signed for me in my absence by First Assistant. Rumour that Abdul had left for Kabul was false. It is said that receipt of letters&apos; threw Abdul into (corrupt group) rage, and he exclaimed (&apos;? group omitted) submit to orders from son of a state servant. He is said to have since given out that he will probably break (corrupt group ? with) Amir and conduct his own policy. Khairo Jan Achakzai refugee now with Ahdul has written to me, whether with or without connivance of Abdul, again urging that we should negotiate with Abdul separately. I shall send him no reply. . Khairo Jams letter was sent after our messenger by Sowar from AbduTs camp. Despatch of further (corrupt group) from Ali Ahmad direct to Governors of Kandahar and Herat, instead of through Abdul, will probably increase latter&apos;s anger. He shows no sign of. withdrawing his troops other than retirement of irregulars from Hindu Bagli neighbourhood. Next few days should show whether AbduFs rage (corrupt group).any result.&quot;
