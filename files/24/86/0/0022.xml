This Document iv th^ n. &quot;&quot;-&quot;&quot;-w^^ Property ofM17? 1 fi /y/&apos;Vo/n Viceroy, Foreign Department, titli, Awjuxl 1919. (Received 10 p.m.)Clear the line.1.1.31. S.&apos; Secret. Afghanistan: My telegram- 1.123 S. Following from (Irani, dated 5th August:- . -&quot; Necessity of awaiting Secretary of State&apos;s orders regarding my giving Ali Ahmad letter regarding Afghanistan^ external relations put me in a most embarrassing position. Afghans were to-day practically prepared to sign peace treaty subject to certain trilling modifications provided 1 (corrupt group) some formal assurance that this treaty recognised freedom of Afghanistan in her external relations. Ali Ahmad now intimates that unless I can gi\e Inn promise that I will give such assurance,&quot;he must refer to Kabul. This will involve deplorable delay with risk of unfortunate incidents on frontier and may necessitate extension of date beyond 1.6th August if we are to deal equitably. I have already staled in writing to Ali Ahmad that treaty contains no suggestion of interference in external relations and for this I accept full personal responsibility. I have, therefore,&apos; practically committed (Government. Treaty of peace which we have been authorised to sign definitely excludes all reference to external relations and it will only excite suspicion of our bona fides, if we demur (corrupt group) this omission leaves Afghanistan free in this respect-and will possibly break down negotiations. Our policy throughout has been to give Afghanistan the liberty she now regards as essential, in the confident belief that before long ;? money) hunger and need for guidance will bring her back to us for help and advice in (corrupt group), an infinitely better solution than the old arrangement. Apart from this the Afghans have to-day received a heavy post from Kabul which may seriously alter their present compliant attitude, particularly if we excite suspicion and delay matters. I shall probably have to give Ali Ahmad a definite reply by noon to-morrow, and I ask for authority before 10 o&apos;clock to give required assurance in such terms as may seem suitable in anticipation of Secretary of State&apos;s orders.&quot;I have throughout warned Afghans that we shall regard Amir&apos;s conduct of his foreign relations as the main test of his friendliness towards us, and have impressed on them that we hope and expect that he will seek our advice in these matters, and have made it quite clear that restoration of subsidy and other privileges will depend upon satisfactory &apos;solution of this as well as subsidiary questions (vide Secretary of State2s telegram).&quot;As no reply has been received from you up to 11 a.in.- this morning, following instructions have been sent to Grant&quot;Secretary of State&apos;s orders have not yet been received. If, however, it is a question of signature of treaty by delegates now, or of reference to Kabul, with grave risk (corrupt group) delay, then you are authorised to give desired written assurance regarding external relations in such form as you think suitable within tlio limits of formula you have submitted. Following emendations in it are suggested Omit the words &apos; suggestion of&apos; in second sentence. Insert between .1a -x, two sentences (moreover this) war has cancelled all former treaties.&apos; &quot;
