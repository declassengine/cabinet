The draft 01 a Water Power Bill which I circulate hore-with is based in part on certain recommendations containedin the Interim.Report of the &quot;water Power Resources Committee (Omd.79).The committee called attention to certain water powers in Scotland, the development of which might prove of assistance in providing employment and expressed the opinion (paragraph 11) &quot;that these potential water &quot;Dowers are to be regarded as National Assets, and that any rights and property necessary for their utilisation should be acquired by the nation&quot;.    In para-graph 17 they call attention to the danger that a partial develop-ment might often prevent the eventual use of the whole available power, and to the desirability of reserving a portion of the power for local needs.The Draft Bill follows to some extent the lines of the Petroleum (Production) Bill 1917, giving exclusive rights of developing water powers above a certain magnitude to the Grown or a licensee.    The considerations to be borne in mind in granting licences are set out in Clause 2 (3).At the present time considerable attention is being direct-ed to the possibilities of water Power as a result both of the Interim Report of the t/nter Power Resources Oommittee and of the increase in the price of coal, but the Board of Trade learn that promotoro are hanging back owing to rumours of impending legislation, and I think that an early opportunity should be taken of introducing the proposed measure, and making a general statement as to its object and the terms on which licences will be granted.A.&apos;? .o, 19
