fte*n&quot;t is the PrftptW-^ /Document is me rrups^;^- /From Viceroy, bth August 1910. (Received Ctli.)Clear the line,11255.   Secret.   Afghanistan.   Following from Grant, 4th August: &quot;Conference met this morning at Afghan delegates&apos; residence. Chief Afghan representative made a statement to the following effect; &quot; &apos;I accept the proposed peace treaty in principle, but suggest modifications :--&quot;&apos; Article I.-Substitute &quot; Afghan Government&quot; for &quot;Amir of Afghanistan,&quot; &quot; &apos; Article II.--Omit the words &quot; in view of the wanton and unprovoked aggression of the Amir which has brought about &quot; and substitute &quot; in consequence of&quot; ; and add at end of Article words &quot; until the time of the (? renewal of the) friendship.&quot;Article HI. Items at issue are (a) the crore sanctioned- by &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government to the late Amir, and (&amp;) annual subsidy and arrears, (aj is really an Afghan deposit in a British treasury ; and His Majesty&apos;s Government should not confiscate trust money; (6) is not a salary due to the Amir personally. It was given originally to Afghanistan because Dost Muhammad did not invade India, and in return for certain territories ceded by Afghanistan, e.g., Kurram, Peshin, &amp;c. It is unjust to suspend it and will discredit the British Government.&quot; &apos; Article IV.-Omit the words &quot; contrite for the past&quot; and substitute &quot; sincerely inclined.&quot;*&apos;&apos; Article V. I cannot agree to the ex paiie demarcation. A joint commission should demarcate the boundary six months hence with equal escorts. Meantime garrisons of all posts on both sides should remain on pre-war basis. I do not agree to British occupation of Afghanistan until demarcation. Meantime trade caravans should continue as before and escorts go to old meeting place.. &quot;&apos; No action should be taken by the British Government against their tribes pending friendship negotiations&apos;.&quot; &apos; Further I should like definite assurance in writing from you as regards the- independence of our relations. This might form either separate article of treaty or be conveyed in separate letter. I attach the greatest importance to this. I realise that it is implied in the treaty, but neither Afghan Government nor Afghan people will be content (? without) real assurance on the subject.&quot; &apos; I will not adumbrate what should form basis of friendship treaty, namely: -&quot; &apos; (1) Afghanistan and the British Government shall have the same enemies.&quot; &apos; (2) Will remedy defects of Afghanistan, e.g., arms, &amp;c. ,      &apos; (?)) Whole tribal territory shall be made over to Afghanistan who will run it on lines that will save the British Government all trouble they have had in this quarter.   Afghan Government shall be given half amount at present expended by British Government on control of tribes.&quot; &apos; I trust that the Chief British representative will not answer now, but will consider these representations and give me his answer later.&apos;&quot; I replied in the following sense : &quot; &apos; If I remain silent now I shall give you false impression that our treaty is open to modification. I have already told you clearly and (? finally that) it cannot be modified.&quot; &apos; Representations you have made will, however, be borne in mind for consideration later should friendship negotiations materialise. You seem to have forgotten that the British Government and British and Indian people are smarting under sense of insult. In many quarters resumption of hostilities would be welcomed. Do not imagine British Government or British people are so anxious for peace that they will agree to treaty that does not emphatically mark their grave displeasure. Peace treaty before you is utmost which His Majesty&apos;s Government is prepared to go, and all we require is your acceptance or rejection. I will, however, briefly deal with amendments you have suggested.Article I.-The Amir and not Afghan people is specifically mentioned because it damages Amir who made war on us, and it is Amir with whom we must make peace, moreover, fluid state of affairs in Afghanistan makes it necessary that we must deal with one person, namely, the Amir. Question of making a permanent treaty can be considered later if friendship negotiations materialise.i*1
&quot; &apos; Article II. Words &quot;in view, &amp;c,&quot; must be retained as emphasising resent-( merit of British Government and British people and explain our attitude.   Further, we cannot agree to addition of words &quot;until the time renewal of friendship,&quot;: because this would mean Amir could claim as a right old privilege regarding importation of arms as soon as friendship was concluded.   It is possible some sucli.( concession may hereafter he granted, but it will be subject certainly to restriction and we have no intention of committing ourselves in matter at present (?).&quot; &apos; Article III. You seem to forget that war tears up all previous agreements1 and previous treaties.   You can claim no rights under those old treaties now and we admit no obligations under them.   Is it reasonable moreover to expect us, having received sudden b!owiin face, to put our hand in our pocket at once and reward striker?   Orore and arrears are definitely confiscated.   Whether or no subsidy wil$ be granted hereafter must depend as I have said on attitude and conduct of Amir.&quot; &apos; Article IV. As matter was trifle I agreed to recommend to Government that,, word &quot; contrite &quot; be omitted as it was held to involve undue indignity to Amir.&quot; &apos; Article V. I refused to consider any of modifications suggested, and. said we insisted on Article as it stands.   They had already received my assurance that there was no intention of using it as pretext for land-grabbing or indefinite retention of&quot; our troops on Afghan soil. .&quot; &apos; As &quot;regards tribes I could listen to no representations. They were our tribes and we should deal with them at our own time in our own way.&apos;&quot; Ali Ahmad then asked if I would take him to see Viceroy to whom he wished to make representations through me. I said this was quite impossible. Ali Ahmad then said &apos; We accept your terms but if you will not accept our modifications we cannot make peace.&apos; I said I had clearly explained our-position and could go no further. I added that 16th August had been fixed as limit, but if Ali Ahmad had authority to accept treaty and meant to accept it I advised him to sign at once because at any moment a frontier incident might arise which- would render our negotiations abortive. I referred them to (report regarding) Afghan troops (?) our, frontier .at (? Withosar) near Peivvar. He said lie would write at once about matter. I said there was no point in our meeting again until they could give me final answer. Ali Ahmad reverted again to necessity of having letter regarding independence of Afghanistan&quot; in her external relations. I said I would consider matter which I referred to-day by telephone joint Foreign Secretary.&quot;After meeting we stayed and lunched with Afghan delegates who were extraordinarily&quot; cordial considering nature of our previous meeting. Ali Ahmad talked very frankly and is evidently sincerely anxious to sign, but question of foreign relations is his difficulty. He saftl there was unanimous agreement that they must have their full sovereign powers recognised but that they had no wish whatever to use freedom thus acquired in tiny way detrimental to us, that if he remained in office he would do his best to induce Amir to consult us freely in this matter, and that he was sure we -would have no cause for complaint. They are of course very anxious for money but they quite realise they just wait for this.&quot;
