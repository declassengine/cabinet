-ftpIP&amp;ML Z$L PROPERTY OF HIS BRIT AM 10 T&apos;AJ:?,3TY &apos;S GOVERNMENT Jl SS C RE T,I---&apos; WAR CABINET ,ij. 794-6. - -.....CONTROL OF HAY SUPPLIES.Copy of. a letter from the Secretary to the Central Council, borage Department Civil Supplies, to thePrime Minister *47, Victoria Street, Westminster,London, S.W.I.7th August, 1919.I understand that the Cabinet has not yet come to a decision, and am directed to call a special Meeting of this Council to consider what action should be taken to safeguard the horse transport of this Courtry from being faced with disaster.I am directed by this Council to bring to your personal notice the very urgent necessity of dealing without further delay with tho question of control of the 1919 Hay Crop.This Council, appointed by the Government to advise upon hay supplies and control same through its County Distributing (Forage) Committees, democratically elected, and being composed of an equal representation of farmers, Me-rchants and consumers has unanimously resolved to recommend the Government to continue control, in &quot;the National interests.(See copy Resolutions attached).The whole of the facts, statistical and otherwise, have been communicated to the President of the Board of Trade and Minister of Food.     If the Board of Agriculture, representing only the farmers1   interests, is.opposti to. control it is based upon a&quot;narrow and selfish view with the object of placing a premium on profiteering in favour of the farmers.I cannot attempt to deal with the whole matter in this letter, but the salient facts are as follows :-(1) It is an. estao-Llshed fact that there is a great shortage in the 1919 bay prop owing to the prolonged drought.(This is proved by reports from Countj Distributing (Forage) Committees, Board of Agriculture Returns, the Public press and Agricultural Journals weekly reporting upon all districts, the phenomenal prices being . asked by farmers,, and hundreds of applications being received by this Council from farmers to release hay of the&quot;l^i8  &quot; crop back to them since they
tLi hi uhave fed off what little of &apos;the 1919 hay crop they had and have not sufficient to carry through the Winter months.     About 60,000 tons have been recently released back to farmers to save their stock from starving or being killed off for sale. )(See copy letter attached of the 1st instant from Board of Agriculture requiring even further indulgence.)(2) The whole of the consumers&apos; and merchants1 organisations throughout the^Couhtry have passed resolutions urging the continuance of control;,,,,  further the &quot;Collieries and the Coal Minos Department of the Board of Trade, the Railway Companies, City and Borough Corporations have pressed for the same i-(3)Xt is of grave National importance that the horse transport of the Country be maintained and that stall fed cattle in the large industrial centres, apart from cattle pn farms, be adequately provided for bo far as available supplies admit.(Horses must have bulk, -there is nothing to take the nlace of hay. . Meat and milk also affected).(4) Attached hefeto are copies of statistics showing :-(a) Hay Crop of the United Kingdom(received from Board of Agriculture).(b) Importation of Hay(received from Board of Trader)tons.In England and Wales the 1918 hay crop g 6,785,000 against an average crop over 27 years of 7,674,365. The Board of Agriculture last month estimated the 1919 hay crop at 5,300,000 tons (against a previous estimate of 6,000,000 tons) but experienced farmers and others keenly interested in agriculture estimate the crop at 3,500,000 tons at most.
Accepting the Board of Agriculture&apos;s figures there is the alarm In/?, shortage of 2,374,000 tons,     Farirer-b a ad&quot; Merchants &quot;have no stocks to carxy even through the Autumn much less through, the Winter months.About 125;000 tons a average tonnage imported yearly, hut this has not &quot;been&quot; available for civil supplies during the War.( )   It: is generally.admitted that there Is not sufficient hay la jhfsJC S5L6,L &quot;&apos;cilQfarmers1 re6u3 rjinjarro&apos;s. - (&apos;for* pFo&quot;of*&apos;&quot;s&quot;t;e &apos;below)$jjgtal 1918 hay crop of England &quot;&amp; Wales % .6^78^,000 tons.Purchased by this Council or transferred from W.D. as on  th July 1919, - 781,660Purohased by W.D.       660,414Less transferred to this Council for civil Supplies. 328.182 3&amp;2,232 1,1:3.398Shewing a balance of - 5&quot;, 671,108left in the hands of farmers when Purchasing Officers made their purchases for W.D. or Civil Supplies.There is thus an eftimatedjie crease in this year1 s hay o:c!5p oF&quot;3^c^TOJ0 A ojis^^which represents more than theToTal pur chaiiJed for.

Importation from a financial point of &apos; view is not economically sound. .   The .: available sources of supply in the United Kingdom should be exploited to the utmost before money goes out of the Country to secure supplies.)(10)     In.torder to. moot the.requirements of South &quot;77ql&apos;e3 Collieries, london and&quot; J&quot; large towns in the Midlands.and ,even  . &quot;ixj Lancashire, this Council hy. had &apos; to purchase or hire some gg; baling machines (owing to the trade not hejng able to provide the lilting capacity) to bale hay in&quot; Cornwall^ and Devon&apos;where&apos; hay has formerly never, to any appreciable extent    .

(Note - It will never do to let the matter drift until the winter before deciding upon one or other of tho above alternatives.   If hay which is required by farmers for stock in their possession is to bo commandeered, the farmers should be assisted by the Government in obtaining other feeding stuffs at as low a price as possible to tako the place of... the hay and such feeding stuffs Would probably have to be im-ported but would tako up far . less tonnage than hay which - cannot ba replaced by any other ^ feeding stuff in feeding horses).Incidentally the information obtained would bo of the utmost valuo not only to the Board of Trade but also to the Ministry of Pood and the Board of Agriculture both as to tonnage of hay -and stock on farms quite apart from horses on farms and in towns.Ill)
