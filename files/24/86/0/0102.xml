(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYTS GOTONMT).homk CONFIDENTIAL.&apos;G.T.-7999.      , 1I ot, WAR    CABINET.&apos;&quot;  yAOILITIES FOR IMPORT Oi? PHOSPHATE ROOK.Memorandum by tho Chiof Secretary lor IrelandiI continue to receive disquieting reports regarding the import into Irolnnd of phosphate rock for the manufacture of superphosphateTho special efforts mode in 1917-18 to extend the area under tillage, in Ireland resulted in an increase of about 700,000 -acres.     This additional tillage area has been for the most part under corn for two years and is now exhausted and foul with weeds and nv longer fit for growing cereals. If these newly broken up lands are to bo efficiently culti-vated with a view to increasing the country1S food supply they must be cleaned and manured, otherwise they will bo less productive than if they had  never been brought under the plough.Before the war tho consumption of superphosphate In Ireland for the smaller area was  20,000 tons.    Last year it was about  00;000 tons.      For the. coming year the minimum required is 2J0,000 tons.     But this quantity cannot be pro-duced unless the factories are kept going steadily throughout the season.So limited has boen the import since 1st June, and so low are the stocks of some cantres that not oni^rjias the production at some of the Works been reduced to half tneir capacity, but in order to prevent them from being closed altogether, and thus Increasing unemployment, phosphates now landed in Ireland have had to be railed from one port to another in order to keep the regular staffs employed,      heedless to say. this still further intensifies congestion on the Railways and adds to the consumption of coal.Figures with which I have bean supplied indicate that the present import arrangements will provide for a production of not more than 160,000 tons of superphosphate in Ireland during the coming season, owing to the fact that the French Government have limited the quantity of Phosphate which can be imported from Tunis and Algeria, and I ^m informed that the deficiency can only bo met by the import of raw phosphato from the United States.At present, however, cargo space for the import of Phos-phate Rock from the Statos is practically unobtainable.   I am informed that quite recently the &quot;Head&quot; Line offered space in four steamers in succession, to transport 3,500 to 4,000 tons of Phosphato from Florida to Dublin and Belfast, but in each case permission to carry phosphate cargo was refused by the British Shipping Control in New Ycrlt.
Ihe result has beon that contracts for supplies into which Irish Manure Manufacturers had entored have been Cofinitely cancelled, owing to their inability to take dolivery within the time specified in tho &quot;Contracts,.     A number of further Contracts, already entered into, will also be cancelled automatically within the next few months if Shipping facilities are not obtained by the importers * and as there is a world demand for Phosphates it is of great importance that this available supply should be secured in order to avoid a serious shortage.I therefore desire to urge that special arrangements should be maao by the Ministry of Shipping to facilitate the import into Ireland of the necessary phosphate from the United States by licensing the requisite tonnage space.(Initialled)     I.M.2 V/hitehall Gardens, S.W. .   14th August, 1919.
