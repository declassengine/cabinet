[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys&quot;Government.]  , n n&apos; :-4 3 9Printed for the War Cabinet.   August 1919.SECRET.79*7At&apos;.THIS is the new draft on Russian Policy which. I have written, to meet the criticisms passed on the first, and to carry out, as best I could, the instructions of the Cabinet.August 16, 1919.C. of K.Foreign Office, August    , 1919.The situation in the different parts of the former Russian Empire is so disquieting, and the need for a co-ordinated policy among the Allied Powers is so urgent, that His Majesty&apos;s Government feel compelled to address an expression of their views to those Allied and Associated Powers with whom they are acting, and to invite a reconsideration by them of the problem in the &apos; form which it has now assumed.Allied military intervention in Russia was originally &apos; undertaken exclusively as a war measure. In whatever region it was attempted, it was designed to prevent the German armies from overrunning the country and acquiring materials and supplies of which they had been deprived elsewhere. Gradually, however, the area of these operations extended; the necessity of supporting those Russian troops or communities which were engaged in fighting the common enemy, and struggling to maintain the independence of Russia, increased as time went on; upon the borders of the old Russian Empire States of non-Russian nationality broke away from the disrupted Empire, and commenced a struggle, sometimes for their own independence, sometimes against the Germans, by whom their existence was threatened, sometimes against the Russian Soviet Government, which endeavoured, to strangle their new-found liberty, and the methods and procedure of which they regarded with the utmost horror.Little by little, therefore, the intervention of the Allies has assumed a wider aspect. In some cases, as in the north of Russia, Allied armies have found themselves vigorously fighting against Bolshevik troops. Elsewhere, without actually engaging -in the struggle, immense contributions of military arms, munitions, and stores have been made to the cause of those who were fighting for a reconstituted Russia, freed alike from German pressure from without and Bolshevik mis-government within. Immense sums of money have been expended; a relative degree of success has in some cases been obtained; but the general impression left, after more than a year of these endeavours, is one of disappointment, in some cases of admitted failure..It cannot be said that an altogether consistent policy has been pursued.   Even now, the principles[616] b*
upon which that policy rests in the last resort are in some respects in dispute. Action is taken sometimes by the representatives oi the Allied and Associated Governments sitting in Paris or by the, institutions which they have set up, sometimes by the Governments themselves. The situation is so complex, and the difficulties of arriving at a decision which is acceptable to all are so great that, in some instances, it would be no exaggeration to admit that there is no policy at all.In these circumstances, the Great Powers where they met and too often it must be confessed that refuge is taken in inaction adopt an uncertain line Of conduct; the financial burden tends to fall almost exclusively on the shoulders of those who either have the greatest capacity or the least unwillingness to pay; the independent States or groups or communities, with the fortunes of which we have associated ourselves, do not always make the best use of the help which they get, and are constantly clamouring for more; it remains a matter of almost weekly disputation whether recognition shall or shall not be extended to this or that community ; Allied Missions despatched in every direction endeavour to produce something like order out of the prevailing chaos; advice is accepted where it is supplemented by substantial material assistance, elsewhere it is apt to be ignored.Meanwhile, with some notable exceptions, the Russian forces whose cause we have espoused seem to be fighting with imperfect vigour and no small lack of success. In some cases the Governments by whom they are directed are suspected of reactionary opinions and desires. It seems uncertain whether they can appeal to the populations of the districts, where they are lighting by the offer of a protection more secure, or an administration less unpopular, than that of the Soviet forces against which they are contending. Simultaneously the Bolshevik armies appear to be gaining in military spirit and efficiency. The Soviet Government,&apos; though its administration is stained by acts of the vilest cruelty and by the most abominable crimes, and though it is constantly alleged upon trustworthy evidence to be on the verge of collapse, it is undoubtedly stronger than it was six months ago.- The general conclusion is suggested, therefore, that the results produced by Allied,intervention have so far. been incommensurate either with the objects for which they were undertaken or with the enormous expenditure involved.Such would appear to be a fair though it cannot be described as a roseate view of the situation. It may be desirable to review this in somewhat greater detail before proceeding to the recommendations-with which this despatch will close,In August 1918 a combined military occupation, first of Murmansk and then of Archangel, was undertaken by the Powers with the objects of closing these ports against Germany, of preventing the establishment by the Germans of a&quot; submarine base in the Arctic, and of keeping a door open for the Allies to Northern Russia. For a time these operations were entirely successful, and they enabled a local Government, entitled the Northern Provisional Government, to establish itself in a position of some security in Archangel. Even at that date it was not contemplated that the Allied occupation should
fr- 440be other than temporary, but it was hoped to give sufficient encouragement and stability to the forces with whom we were acting to enable them to stand after the Allied contingents had withdrawn. Furthermore, as time went on, and as the star of Admiral Koltchak appeared to be in the ascendant, and his forces were steadily pushing their way towards the west, it was hoped to establish&apos;contact between his armies, operating from Siberia, and those of the Northern Provisional Government.; Accordingly, within the last few months, His Majesty&apos;s Government despatched a fresh relief force to Archangel, with the view of facilitating an advance by the forces of the Archangel Government to Kotlas and Viatka, where it was hoped that a junction with, the Siberian forces would be made. This operation has had to be abandoned, in consequence of the series of disastrous reverses sustained by Admiral Koltchak ; and it is now more than doubtful whether, when Archangel and Murmansk have been evacuated by the Allied forces, the Northern Provisional Government will continue to exist. Meanwhile, the arrangements for the promised evacuation, which for many reasons it is impossible to postpone beyond the forthcoming autumn, are far advanced. Steps are being taken to withdraw those classes of the native population which will be placed in serious danger by our withdrawal, and it appears certain that, before the winter has closed in, the military front that has been maintained in this region against the Soviet forces will for the most part, if not entirely, have vanished.In Siberia the situation has undergone a decided change for the worse. Some months ago the prospects of Admiral Koltchak appeared to be promising. The recognition of his Government had long been pressed for by the Allied representatives at Omsk as a solution of many of his difficulties and as calculated to consolidate his power. It was not, however, till June of this year that an exchange of notes took place between the Allied Powers and Admiral Koltchak, and even then all 1 hat the latter undertook was the continuance of support to him on certain conditions. This action on the part of the Powers was, at first, generally interpreted in Siberia as a formal recognition of the Omsk Govern-ment, and its immediate result was to increase the prestige of Admiral Koltchak and to produce a very considerable rise in the value of the rouble. But when&quot; it was realised that the step taken by the Powers did not involve recognition, but merely &quot; continuance of support,&quot; the reaction was correspondingly marked. Admiral Koltchak has lately suffered a series of continuous reverses, and his forces are still reported to be in full retreat.The situation has not been eas^ed by the action of the Omak Government in the administration of its internal affairs, and there is evidence that the dissatisfaction which has been created will assume dangerous propor-tions unless the Allied Governments can assist in stabilising the position, and can exercise the necessary pressure on Admiral Koltchak to conform his policy to principles acceptable not only to the Allied Governments, but also to public opinion among the populations whom he rules or aspires to rule.In South Russia the position is much more favour-able.   Though, driven back in the spring of this year by
the Soviet armies, General Denikin has recently suc-ceeded in inflicting numerous severe reverses on the forces opposed to him, and has made a deep advance into Russia. According to the reports which have been received, this advance has been welcomed by the population in the occupied territory, and there seems to be gdod ground for the belief that, provided General Denikin can be assured of the&apos; necessary material assistance, and will keep in view the central object of his endeavour, which is on the one hand to effect a junction with the forces of Admiral Koltchak on the Siberian side, and,on the other to drive the Bolshevik armies back upon Moscow, he may attain a success which has been denied to his chief.Up to the spring of the present year Allied troops were in occupation of Odessa, and of considerable tracts of territory surrounding that port. Their unfortunate withdrawal, however, in April enabled the Soviet Government to establish themselves both at Odessa and in the Crimea, and to constitute a threat to General Denikin&apos;s flank in the Donetz basin. It is as yet too early to predict with any confidence whether this mis-fortUne can be retrieved.The&apos; situation in the Ukraine is at present obscure. It is certain, however, that the authority of the Russian Soviet Government is not generally recognised in these-areas, where an independent Ukrainian Government, under the leadership of General Petlura claims to exercise jurisdiction. None of the Allied Governments has hitherto recognised General Petlura&apos;s authority, and there have been no dealings with his Government. His Majesty&apos;s Government have always regarded the Ukraine as an integral part of Russia, and they have felt very strongly that, the utmost care should be taken to avoid any steps which might commit them to encouraging the separatist tendencies of certain sections of Ukrainian opinion. Economically, the Ukraine can never be separated from. Russia, and this must always be a predominant factor in considering Russo-Ukrainian relations.On the Western Russian front, Poland and the Baltic States of Lithuania, Latvia, and Esthonia are conducting military operations against the Russian Soviet Govern-ment. So far as the Baltic States are concerned, con-tinuance of their resistance depends largely on the amount of material assistance which they may be able to obtain, as well as upon the attitude which the Allied Governments may decide to adopt in regard to their national aspirations. Politically, the present situation is in the highest degree unsatisfactory. His Majesty&apos;s Government have -recognised the de ,facto authority of the Provisional Governments of Esthonia and Latvia established at Reval and Libau respectively, and the Allied representatives in Paris have, in the fifth condition attached to the recognition of Admiral Koltchak, laid down that &quot;if a solution of the relations between Esthonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and the Caucasian and Transcaspian territories and Russia is not speedily reached by agreement, the settlement will be made in consultation and co-operation with the League of Nations, and that, until such settlement is made, the Government of Russia agrees to recognise these territories as autonomous and to confirm the relations which may exist between their   de facto Governments   and   the   Allied and
1     T    j441Associated Governments.&quot; Yet no further steps have been taken to endeavour to secure the co-operation of the Border States of Russia in the policy laid down by the Allied Powers, and no communications have been addressed to the representatives of these States in Paris, in spite of their repeated requests to be informed of the intentions of the Allied Governments. Grave dissatis-faction has consequently resulted in Latvia, Lithuania, and Esthonia. In the north of Esthonia a Russian corps, formed out of the relics of the old Russian Twelfth Army Corps, has been operating partly in conjunction with the Esthonian forces. This corps is badly in need of arms and material, but on the whole has succeeded in maintaining its position. The relations of the leaders of this corps with the Esthonians are not altogether satisfactory on account of the suspicions entertained by the Esthonians concerning the intentions of the. Great Russians; but no breach has yet occurred, and the Esthonian forces have recently assisted the corps in meeting the attacks of the Russian Bolshevik forces on this front.On the other hand, the hopes that were at one time so widely entertained of an advance upon Petrograd by the combined forces of Esthonians, Finns, and the Russian armies still operating in this neighbourhood have had to be abandoned. Furthermore, the Germans exhibit a calculated reluctance to withdraw&apos; from these parts of the Baltic States which they were&apos; rashly permitted to occupy with their forces; and the general situation on this front cannot be described as otherwise than disquieting.In Finland the situation is complicated. - While&apos; certain Finnish: leaders were strongly in favour of co-operating in the advance on Petrograd with the forces under the command of General Judenitch, a considerable and influential section of Finnish opinion has through-out been opposed to this course, unless the approval and assistance of the Allied Governments could first be secured. Loans and war material on a considerable scale have been solicited by the Finnish Government for this purpose. His Majesty&apos;s Government have not&apos; hitherto seen their way to do more than approve- the agreement concluded between General Mannerheim and General Judenitch for the projected advance on Petrograd, and they have refused to assume the additional responsibility demanded by the Finnish Government. With the falL of General Mannerheim the project has received its coup de grace.The lack of a clear and decisive policy has been not less manifest in the dealings with the Border States on the Caucasian front. Since; the retirement of the German and Turkish forces from those regions, various republics, with a greater or less degree of encouragement. from the Allied Powers, have there maintained an independent or quasi-independent existence. Of these the most considerable and the most promising has been the Republic of Georgia. The next in potential range and resources has been the Republic of Azerbaijan. Smaller groups have sustained a more precarious autonomous livelihood in Russian Armenia and in Daghestan ; but of these it has been generally conceded that, the former will in all probability be incorporated in a larger Armenia, should such be created^ while the latter has already, to a large extent, been absorbed in the area controlled by General Denikin&apos;s troops.[616] C
Here, as elsewhere, the policy of the Allied Powers has hovered between recognition and polite indifference, and the efforts of the British representatives who have been in military occupation of this territory prior to a withdrawal, which is now on the eve of being carried out, have been mainly directed to the preservation of order, the avoidance of inter-Statal or&apos; inter-racial conflicts, the prevention of collision between the forces of the republics and those of General Denikin, and the recognition by the latter of the incipient liberties of the various national groups.Although these republics are in each case represented at Paris, and although it is understood that their future status is in the hands of the Peace Conference, no definitive decision appears to have been reached as to the form of recognition to which they are entitled, or the degree of autonomy which they are to be permitted to enjoy. All is in flux and uncertainty, and with the withdrawal of the only Allied forces to the south of the Caucasus, serious disturbance, if not wTorse, may be expected to ensue. Indeed, as these words are being written, alarming rumours continue to be received as to the imminence of a -general reign of bloodshed in the evacuated territories, with the probable extirpation by massacre of large numbers of the Armenian population in the former province of Russian. Armenia,&apos; about and around Nakchivan./ It will be seen from this brief survey of the situation on the various Russian fronts that, with the sole exception of South Russia, where General Denikin is operating, the military situation is the reverse of satisfactory. The almost complete collapse of Admiral Koltchak&apos;s army and the. withdrawal from Archangel will release large Bolshevik forces which the Soviet Government will be able to throw either south, or west against the fronts on which most reliance had hitherto been placed. Whether these will be able to withstand the shock it is as yet too early to determine.If would perhaps be an unjustifiable deduction from the untoward developments that I have described, to argue that they have been mainly due to lack either of political vision or harmony on the part of the Allied and Associated Powers. But it would not be unfair to, attribute the set-back in part to the fact that single Powers have, to a considerable extent, dissipated-on various theatres such resources as they have been in a position to give to the whole, instead of pursuing an organised policy&apos; whereby effort could be concentrated and a due co-ordination established between political, military, and financial measures.In.this respect His Majesty&apos;s Government feel it incumbent on them to submit, a clear statement of the share as it appears to them a wholly disproportionate share-of the Russian burden, which they have borne,. more especially since the outbreak of the Bolshevik revolution in November 1917..Their commitments in Russia date back, indeed, to a much earlier period, and it is public knowledge that, the vast sums, which were contributed by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the form of loans to enable Russia to maintain her armies and prosecute campaigns against Germany in the early stages of the war, amounted to the prodigious figure of 565,000,()00Z.It is, however, to the contributions made by this
country since November, 1917, that His Majesty&apos;s Government desire particularly to draw attention.In North Russia they have maintained forces since August 1918 of approximately 14,000, recently increased to 18,000 men, at a cost up to the period of evacuation of 5,600,000i. ; to which, must be added the cost of the naval operations connected with this expedition, amounting to 7,800,000i. They have further equipped the Russian troops in this area, fed the civilian population, subventioned the Provisional Government, and established a sound currency system, at a total additional cost of .15,000,0001. While this expenditure may eventually, under various agreements that have been concluded, be partly recovered from the Allies, the initial cost has fallen almost entirely on the shoulders of His Majesty&apos;s Government.In Siberia they have supplied equipment to the forces of Admiral Koltchak to the value of 14,600,OOOZ. They have also maintained two regiments in Western Siberia, and have assumed responsibility for expenditure on material for the Siberian railway to the amdunt of 4,000,000 dollars. They have during the last six months maintained a considerable staff for this purpose in Siberia at the cost of 9,000L a month.In South Russia they have despatched material to General Denikin to the value of more than 26,000,0001., and have maintained forces in the Caucasus at a cost which will have amounted, when evacuation is completed, to over 4,000,000Z. They have further maintained naval forces in the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea at a cost in the same period of 4,000,0002.In the Baltic they have furnished arms and material to the forces of Esthonia, Latvia, and the -Russian Northern Corps at a cost of 2,800,0001., in addition to maintaining strong naval forces in the Baltic and the Gulf of Finland.The above are the chief commitments which have been accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government. The total cost of their intervention in Russia will, it is estimated, have exceeded 94,000,OOOL before the close of the present year.As a result of all these efforts His Majesty&apos;s Govern-, ment have practically exhausted their resources in respect of war material, at the very moment when increased demands are being made upon them in Siberia, South Russia, Poland, the Baltic States, and Finland.They feel therefore that the moment has arrived when, not merely in their own interests, but in view of the larger general considerations that have been already urged, a revised and more concerted arrangement is required among the Allied and Associated Powers as to their future political,, military, and financial responsi-bilities in Russia, ass-uming-that these are still to be maintained. Whether it is . desirable to effect a new redistribution of the shares to be assumed by each Power ; whether the financial and military burden should continue to be borne, and, if so, by whom, and in what proportions; whether the best plan will be to allot definite spheres of activity to particular Powers; or whether there should be a revision of policy over the entire field of action in every part of the former Russian Empire : these are questions which, it seems to His Majesty&apos;s Government, call for immediate examination, and without an early reply to which it can hardly be expected that, better results can be obtained.
With this object in view, His Majesty s Government desire to propose to the representatives of the Allied and Associated Powers in Paris that an early Conference should take place there, at which each of the Powers should be represented by one of its foremost statesmen, with the aim of arriving at a decision on this important subject. His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to place before such, a Conference their idea of the general policy which it is desirable to pursue, and the pare which they themselves are prepared to take in it. They confidently hope that the other Powers will enter the Conference, should this proposal be accepted, with similar plans. In any case, if this procedure be adopted, there will at least be some hope that the present impasse may be brought to an end, that a policy to which all &quot;would adhere may be thought out and accepted, and that the sacrifices, in some cases overwhelming in character, to which all have submitted in the cause of a free and recovered Russia will not have been made in vain.
