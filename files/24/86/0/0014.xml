lv, mmmm by thb mmisjbr&apos;ot health. h,6.Use of Hostels and Military Huts, for Civilian Workers.. 4y    I have very carefully considered the recommendations contained in Sir R6bert Horne&apos;s Memorandum of .2Jrd July G.T.7780 - &quot;but 1 think that any provision of temporary housing accommodation &quot;by means of huts should form part of the general housing scheme df the local authority undertaking the provision, and that any special subsidy, over and above the grant which the Government have already promised, should if possible be avoided;2.    Though there are no doubt places where temporary houses made from huts will be welcomed and should be provided rapidly, it is difficult to forecast the extent of the demand for this form of accommodation.Following Sir Robert home a conference of 6th June, enquiries were made of the local Housing Commissioners and .. the question of converting huts was specially discussec\at their meeting on the 11th June,   The Commissioners were  x unanimous in expressing&apos;the&apos;following opinions(a) That there was no demand on the part of localauthorities for the acquisition of huts for temporary housing purposes.(b) Very few representations or enquiries for huts had beenreceived by the Commissioners.   A few local authorities who had considered the conversion of huts as a means of supplying accommodation temporarily had come to the conclusion that it would be unsatisfactory and costly, (p)   The general feeling of local authorities was veryaverse from temporary provision being made in this&quot; way-and were convinced that it would be extremely unpopular
(d)   The effect on the progress of permanent housing schemes would he disastrous.At a conference at the Ministry of Health labour representatives from Scunthorpe, which is one of the places included in the list attached to Sir Robert Home&apos;s memo-randum, expressed strong objections to huts. The Medical Officer of Health for the West Riding of Yorkshire stated at a meeting a few days ago that huts would certainly not &quot;be acceptable to people in Yorkshire.3.    But though I doubt whether any large general scheme for the use of huts oould be pressed, I am clear that there are some places where huts ought to be used;   and that arrangements ought to be made under which the local authority requiring them should be able to obtain them readily and at a reasonable price.I have stated in the House of Commons that I shall be prepared to regard the provision of accommodation by means of converted huts as part of a.local housing scheme which will rank for State; financial assistance.   A scheme has actually been sanctioned and is approaching completion at Hammersmith and the Borough Council are proposing to extend the sohemc. &apos; Eastbourne has made similar provision. Winchester is arranging to take over a camp and convert the huts into houses, and Liverpool is proposing similar arrangements.Poplar. Cannock and Darlington are other places which are taking steps to acquire huts for housing purposes.4.    In accordance&apos;with the decision of the War Cabinet on 15th July,&apos; conferences have been held between officers of the Treasury, of the Ministry of Munitions and of my department for the purpose of finding   &quot;a fair price &quot; (to be &quot;less than&apos;the prices now secured by the Disposal Board for individual sales&quot;) at which temporary huts can be offered to and used by local authorities to help in solving the
I tj iexisting housing problem.On the basis of the oonclusions arrived at in the oourse of these conferences, I now desire to recommend as follows(a) That temporary huts required by local authorities should be sold to these authorities at a discount of 33^  below the valuation of the property as determined either by the Disposal Board;   or, where their valuationis challenged, by an, independent valuer agreed upon between the Disposal Board and the local authority.(b) That the net pride thus ascertained should be regarded as the &quot;fair price&quot; contemplated by the War Cabinefs previous decision, and not as a subsidised price entailing either nominally or actually, a capital grant.(o)   That the above arrangement should apply not only to huts required for housing schemes, but to huts and hostels required by local authorities in connection with schemes for the treatment of tuberculosis.(d)   The circumstances relating to hostels appear to be exceptional and it is urged that there may be difficulty in arriving at a valuation of any particular hostel.   As regards the use of hostels for housing purposes, however, it is probable that local authorities would only use them as lodging houses for a very limited period - possibly for a few months only - as compared with the period of 7 to 10 or 15 years for v/nioh converted huts would be used,   I ;.... would suggest therefore that, where necessary, the use of hostels should be assured to a local authority on loan, end.; that at the end of the period the hostel should revert to the Disposal Board for sale.   Ibr this purpose the Min4.Rter of Health should stand temporarily possessed of all h&amp;etelbg, on the understanding that those which he finds are not required for housing purposes should be transferred to the Disposal Board as Boon as they are vacant and available.. .
.    i    Arf(e) That local authorities should have an option to purchase in priority to any other purchaser and on the terms above mentioned all huts of such selected types as the Ministry of Health may designate as specially suitable for use by local authorities;   and that huts of the designated types and hostels shall not be sold otherwise than to local authorities either by the Disposal Board or by the War Office.without notice having been given to the Ministry of Health.a sufficient period in advance of the sale to enable my department to ascertain whether it is desired to exercise the option in the particular case.(f) That particulars should be furnished by the War Office of all huts of the designated types which are still in War Office possession and that every effort should be made by the War Office to expedite the evacuation of any such huts which are represented by the Ministry of Health to be urgently needed by local authorities.I request Cabinet approval for these reCommenda-tions,C ADDIS01T. 6*8,19.inistry of Health!
