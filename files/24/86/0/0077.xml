APPOSBp m&amp; WMLThe interim trade policy now in operation expires on September 1st.  The results hoped for have been attained.   Trade has restarted and employment is rapidly improving.  Bat the policy cannot be safely continued.   It is full of defects, whioh increase with the lapse of time; and the recovery of trade has been followed by a problem of high prices, to whioh import restrictions contribute, &quot;Moreover, it is now essential to remove as far as possible the feeling of uncertainty about the future which hampers trade in an increasing degree as producers are forced to look further ahead and&apos; further afield.After surveying the economic outlook, I am &apos;convinced that it is necessary to put forward a compre^ hensive scheme.  It is notto Unexpected that one or two trifling measures will suffice after five years&apos; diversion from&quot;normal economic activities and the loss and dislocation which has been suffered in so many countries.The policy that I recommend is briefly described below.  Two fundamental ideas may be emphasised.In the first place it may be remarked that export must be a prime consideration.  Before the war we were far&apos;more dependent upon exports than other countries, and toSay we have to make good losses of imports due tc sales of securities abroad, and to provide for the new claims created by our borrowings abroad. Very roughly sneaking; (for exact calculations are impossibleJ we must bring Dur export (aoart from re-exports) as near as we can to  100,000,000 a month.  In no recent month since the war have they reached  70,000,000, and the average is materially less. And we must do this with an  inoverished and largely disorganised Europe,In the second place - and partly as a consequence of this - much greater efficiency all round, and particularly in&quot;basic and key industries, is a vital need, which reduced hours ana higher wages make the more insistent.   Special efforts are called for after a period in which our energies could not be devoted mainly to general productive equipment.The details of the oolioy that Lrecommend are as follows:-
((1) Abandonment of export of the Exchanges, except in so far as*aonie; Doriowihg&quot;may for a timePbe necessary to prevent the complete collapse Of any important Bschange. At present they are being supported mainly by borrowing from the United States.    The &quot;effect is that imports from the United states are encouraged.    The further fall of the Amorloan Exchange&quot;would be equivalent to an import duty on goods from U.S.A.    Also it would stimulate our exports to the United States, and our exports to other countries would tend to be stimulated also, while our imports would probably suffer discouragement, because a further depreciation of the poundsterling in&quot;terms of the dollar would tend to be followed, by a fall in its value in terms of other currencies.Protection of Goods manufactured in Great Britain andIreland against Dumping by preventing the sale in thiscountry of similar goods beneath their price in the country of origin.(3) Postering Unstable Key Industries.   By liey industries are meant&quot;TEoae&quot;which, produce&apos; commodities&apos; upon whioh larger and important industries are in a great measure dependent, and which in the experience of the v/ar were found to be insufficiently developed in the United Kingdom to meet our needs.    With regard to such industries, the following proposals are made:-The Board of Trade should be empowered to prohibit the import except on licence of the products of a scheduled industry. The quantity imported should be limited to a variable fraction of the home production and should usually not be less than 5C$ of that production.    In order to prevent an excessive profit from being obtained by the importer, in cases in which the import price is considerably lower than the price ruling in this country, fees should be charged for lioenses.    In the fixing of these fees, regard should be had to the differences between the prices at which the articles can be imported and the prices at which similar articles can be sold in the United ICingaom.     It is not intended, however, that the fees should be varied frequently but that in each case a fee should be fixed which is likely, in all the circumstances of the case, to be suitable for a lengthy period,    The licence fee should range between 50^ and *75^ of the difference between the maximum home controlled price and the average foreign price c,i.f. sterling equivalent.     It is not intended that the licence fee should operate as an import duty, which would restrict the importation over and above the restriction imposed by the prohibition of importation except under licence. Che full licensed amount would be imported;   but, as explained, the fee would be charged in order to prevent the bulk of the profit
Ktprofit on. the importation from accruing to the importer. Finally, recommendations should he made by the Board in regard to industries whioh, in their opinion, may require, in addition, financial assistance.Tho following schedule of industries is suggested by the Board of Trade.Synthetic dyes - fa scheme relating to which isalready in operation) :Synthetic organic fine chemicals:Optical glass :Lenses, prisms, and like optical devices: - Hosiery latoh needles : Potash compounds :Tungsten powder and ferro-tungsten : Magnetos : chemical glass : Illuminating glass-ware : Chemical porcelain :Specified classes of scientific (including tptioalf and surgical instruments:Rubber tyrts:Zinc oxide:Lithopono:Thorium nitrate:(Jas mantles and mantle rings:Gauges of specified kinds and dividing engines:In the case of these industries, it is intended that the Board of Trade should maintain an effective supervision including control of price, profits, con-ditions of labour, and efficiency Of method, or perhaps &quot;become associated with the direction, with a view to promoting their efficiency and securing their indepen-donee at the earliest possible date.It should be noted that the following, articles, out-side the group of &quot;food, drink, and tobacco&quot;,, are subject to import duties, under the Knanoe Act:- motor cars, including motor bicycles and tricycles, accessories, . and component parts thereof; matchea and mechanical lighters; cinematograph films; mualcal instruments and accessories and component parts thereof.
(4)...3/teite. Op-operation with ffoak &quot;Key11 or Bssential Into tide a.During the War the Government has found it neoessery to lend support in oertain industries whose establishment or maintenance in this country is of importance.    The Dye industry is probably the best known case.    It is the intention of the Government to continue but not necessarily to add to its obligations on these, lines where the policy has already been embarked upon, but support will be accompanied either by the association of the Board of   rade with the direction of the industries in&apos;question, so as to Seoure that the purposes in view are achieved, or the ; laying down of conditions and the maintenance of supervision.(5)   Organisation of jbwer Pro due tion.    Shis is another.&apos; integral part of a&quot;complete industrial efficiency policy, which will become of increasing importance.   A Bill is now before Parliament with regard to electric power and a Bill with regard to the control and development of wteivpower is also being brought forward.      Other schemes relating to&quot;power-produotion may in addition be advisable.(6)   Technical Instruetion     The human side calb for immediate attention&quot; in any,tatisfao*fory scheme for the promotion of efficiency.    Advance must be made in respect of tho training, not on.y of skilled workmen, but also of managers, and not the least difficult step will be secuilhg that full use is made of the-facilities offered.      The President&apos;of the Board of Education has suggested -(a)   That &amp; report should be drawn upon the higher grade technical needs of each of the principal industries of the country by a committee representative of the Board.of Education, the 4)ar&amp; of.Trade, the Ministry of Labour and the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, with representatives of the industries concerned..    Such a report would show up the many deficiencies and gaps in our present organisation of higher technical education.(b)&apos;    That the Whitley Councils should be requested&quot;to form sub-committees upon lower grade technical education, i.e. the education of workmen and managers*    These Whitley sub-committees should be brought into connection with tho technical Committees of the Local Education Authorities.(0)    That the J-ooal Education Authorities should be en-courage d to take advantage of Clause 6 in the Act of 1913 and should submit to the Board of Education schemes for technical education in particular branches of homogeneous economic ureas, e.g, coal fields^    This ought to be part^od.the general plan to encourage contributions from the Industries*     &quot; s
The President of the Board, of Education anticipates, moreover, considerable benefit generally from the forma-tion of research associations Under the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and from the estab-lishment of continuation schools under the Act of 1918, but believeB that the prime necessity at present is so to impress employers with the advantages of technical education as to induce them to make full use of existing facilities.(7)   Promotion of Industrial Research and Invention.A beginning has been made at promoting industrial research, but further efforts are needed along the general lines already laid down.   The patents bill now before Parliament should have the effect of encouraging the taking up and use of inventions.(8)   Furtherance of standardisation.   There is grow-..............i ii,&apos;............&apos; &quot; I-  .....* .....&apos;i..........- &apos; ......        mm urning recognition of the importance for the future of Brit-ish Industry of the principle and practice of Standard!sa-tion.   The essentials are (a)   The authoritative deter-mination in respect of materials and plant of the most suitable standarda of quality and performance; (b)   The establishment of uniformity of specification by the adop-tion, so far as practicable, of the Standards thus authoritatively -determined, and the consequential Stand-ardisation and economy of production;   (c)   The establiah-ment of an efficient system of testing.So far the State has done little, except to give some financial assistance to the work of the Engineering Standards Association.   If standardisation is to be extended, it must be directly encouraged, and testing must be done by institutions recognised by the Government as impartial and efficient, the marks consequently having the Government imprimatur.,  The matter is of special moment in connection with a scheme which has been put forward by the interests concerned for the establishment of a National Electrical Proving House.   It is also important in connection with the testing of chemical glass and gauges which has been carried on during the war on a large scale at the National Physical Laboratory.   It is eminently desirable that a Department of Standards should be set up at the Board of Trade (i) to promote and co-ordinate standerdisation generally, and for this -purpose to co-operate with, and assist- financially, if &apos; necessary&apos;, such bodies as the Engineering Standards Association: and (ii) to establish and administer such Testing Institutions as may be found necessary, and authorise and, so far as may be required, supervise the testing work carried out by Technical Institutions, Trade Organisations or private concerns.   The Government Test-ing institutions should be self-sustained, at least, after the early stages, deriving their revenue from fees,(9)   Co-operation with industry to ensure theprovision of raw materials and foster Imperial supplies.A policy of industrial security should clearly keep under review supplies of raw material and aim at develop-ing, so far as possible, the sources under British control Much work of this kind has already been commenced during the war..
As regards flax for instance, work has been done during the war by the Flax Control Board in respect of Flex Seed production in Canada, and the extension and improvement of Flax-growing in Ireland, and by the 13oard of Agriculture in respect of flax growing in Great Britain; and investigations are now being carried on by the Itoire Flax Growing Committee, established By the Board oi Tradb.    As regards Cotton, Government assistance ha3 already been given to the British Cotton Growing Association, and for the development of cotton growing in the Sudan, and the further steps necessary to promote cotton-growing within the Empire are being considered by the Mire Growing Committee established bv the Board of Trad6. on wnich the other Governments of the Empire and of the&apos; cotton growing and using interests are represented. For this, funds are required, and it is recommended that any profits under the ftgrotian cotton &quot;buying scheme at the disposal of the British Government should be allocated to this purpose.    As regards Potash and Optical Munitions, the Glassware and Potash Production Department of the Ministry of Munitions has devoted considerable effort to establishing home production.   As regards Minerals, the Imperial Mineral Resources Bureau, representative of all the Governments of the Empire, has been established to secure the systematic collection of information as to the Empirefs resources and to advise the Governments of the Empire as to the development of surveys on a systematic and comprehensive plan.    Provision must be made for more complete surveys in the United Kingdom itself.(10) Development of Agriculture.    A policy of efficiency and security cannot begin and end with industry apart from agriculture.    National efficiency must be rooted&quot;in national health, and is bound up with a proper balance between rufcal and urban occupations.    Consequently, agricultural efficiency is involved, and the part played by agriculture in the national economy.    This raised too large a problem for adequate notice here, out regarding it solely from the industrial side, thisE1   rvation may be made.   !fhe war allotments have disclosed an te desire to oultivate^and in a considerable proportion of smen.    Provision Emstt$fe madev not only to satisiy that desire but to allow it to %reloa by creating. In the vicinity of all towns, cottage hoMfcrigs to which are attached an area of land, large enou$i for fh*C$&amp;ctice of a supplementary hgri/6altural or horticultural-business, but small enough, to -pe within the compass of the $pare time of the wage-earner, -is the industries tend to move5- out of the Mgjily-rated &quot;urban areas, the opportunity for setting up these -cottage holdings will arise.  The holders of allotments and cottage holdings pre all potential small holders, and from them and their sons will be derived new recruits for larger farming.(11) Improved OomaBnieaffions both jnternallv and between all parts of the Empire..,whether shipping, postal, cable/or wireless,    ffie external farirofmthis policy is essential for the consolidation- of the Empire, the development of the natural resources of the overseas parts of the Empire, and the increased sale in these markets of goods from the United Kingdom.
economic, political and defensive ends would bo furthered,-. On a resolution of the Imperial War Conference anU Imperial Investigation Board is at present being constituted, representing His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Dominions, together with shipping and commercial representatives to inquire into and report on all matters connected with ocean freights and facilities, and all matters connected with the development and improvement of the sea communications between the different parts of the Itonpire, with special reference to the size and type of ships and the capacities of harbours.   (three of the Dominions, viz., Australia, South Africa and Ifewfoundland have already selected their representatives).(la) Improved Registration of Imports (including those T?** ought1 by parcel post ).    Ibis is designed to secure more accurate and more detailed returns to serve as a basis for antidumping measures and to show how competition stands with reference to any particular British industry.   It is proposed that the fee charged should be one per mille ad valorem.(13) Power to prohibit the importation of goods, except on lloencel   from countries from viiioh exportation to this country is stimulated in consequence of the state of the countries exchanges in relation to levels of cost in this country and the country in question .$he international trading position of Great Britain, taken as a whole, is relatively not inferior to 12iat which we held before the War, although actually there is a deterioration in the position of all*countries except the United States,  Further, we cannot assume ihat debtor nations will continue to export goods at prices, arising from exchange, which do not bear due relation to the skill and labour of production, and it is probable that large rises in prices in the exportable goods of all countries whose credit has deteriorated will shortly take  ace, where it has not already done so.  II or withstanding this, the present state of the exchange is so extraordinary 12iat reserve powers to check a sudden and undue importation of geods at prioes altogether below the cost of production should &quot;be temporarily retained by the Government.   We want to receive the goods which are our due, but not to receive them with such suddenness and in such volumes as to dislocate and depress our home industry,(14)   Bos to rat action of  trade with disorganised partsof lauropo.   At pia-war&quot;values, our exports of the produce and manufactures of the United Kingdom to the European belligerent countries other than Prance, Belgium, Italy and Portugal amounted to about  75,000,000. (of which Germany accounted for about ^40,000,000) while out total exports h$ iiurope as a whole were as much as  180,000,000. Insurance of soo&amp;s in trade with 3.3. Russia, has already been arranged, and the application of the scheme can be extended.
iilso a schoaae is now under am sideration for the furnishing of credits by the Government with some gusitmtee against risks in approved cages in which payment cannot be immediately made either in &quot;bills or goods though security can &quot;be given..    As a result of State action in this direction, e beginning will be made in restoring trade connections, and it is hoped that^faaaking houses will be encouraged to play a larger pert in what has to he done.(15) jg,Mo,tl9ft.- ffiporfc IftradeGovernment action, through Consular and Commercial attache Services, and otherwise, to secure or develop markets overseas, is required.    The encourage-ment of exports is urgently needed in view of the large sales of our foreign securities, our borrowings abrnad, the disorganised or impoverished state of most European markets, and the lact that in others we start with the handicap of having to win back our place.(16) f rot potion, against......fanaful fiombina tioa.   The safe-&apos;guarding of the public&quot; aid the economic system against the effects&quot;of domestic and international business combinations, so far as they prove harmful, is obviously called for.    (Jombina-tions of various kinds, particularly for the regulation of sales,?rices and output, had become a notable feature&quot;even before he War, and during the War they have been fostered.    In many respects tho results may be beneficial, but the guarantee of &apos; competition that prices end profits shall not continue for long at &quot;unreasonable rates is removed.    There would seem to be no doubt that tile Board of Trade will be oxpected to hold a watch-ing brief on behalf of the public, and have powers to make, or cause to be made-, any thorough investigations that may be needed, bo til as a warning to&apos;combinations that their operations are not being disregarded-and as a preliminary to taking&apos; action in time if it should become advisable.    The procedure recommended by the Committee on Trusts, with some possible modifications, appears to be on the right lines.(17) Collection of information about production, prices. Q5Si^an ..B.r.Q&quot;fiifi.. In order to carry out effectively the essential parts of the industrial and commercial oolicy outlined above, and to meet the demands that maybe expected for fuller economic information, it, is proposed(a) that the collection of information regarding the movement of prices and the cost of living snould be continued,ana developed.  .(b) that power should be pi von to investigate costs of production and distribution in the scheduled key and other essential industries and in/other cases in which it was found desirable.    any(c) that the information received through the Census of Production should be expanded in some respects, in particular so as to include capital and profits, and that the more important portions of this&quot;information should be secured annually and made available, with certain restrictions, for Government departments.12th Augusta.
