In view of S.N.O., Baltic&apos;s, telegram, "stating that there are sufficient German ships at Libau for "this purpose, do you require any more ships to carry out this "decision, details of which were communicated to General "Gough from War Office?"

S.N.O., Baltic, on 7th reported that the ships were available at Libau, and "Babylon" should carry 8,000 -10,000 men. He presumes that more than one trip will be necessary.

A.N.A.C. sent following telegram to Admiral Goette, No. 1705 of 3rd August:-

General Burt at Riga reports on 6th August that Marshal Foch&apos;s orders of 1st August have not yet reached Von der Goltz. Von der Goltz has pointed out that his present plan of evacuation will he delayed if he is compelled to evacuate by sea.

Esthonia.
SLN.O. considers it most imperative that H.M. Govern^, ment should give a definite pronouncement regarding the future status of Esthonia.   He states that the continued uncertainty is rapidly leading to the wreck of the whole situation, and handicaps every Naval effort,  foreign Office has been requested to take action on this matter.General Gough telegraphs from Helsingfors that the Russian North West Army alone is worse than useless, and that a decision as to recognition of Esthonia is of utmost importance to ensure active co-operation of Esthonians. which is essential for success of Russian Worth West Army.    At; present Esthonians are hearing main brunt of fighting, and, as they could probably make good terms with the Bolsheviks, it is unlikely they will continue much longer.Yamburg has been deliberately evacuated by the North West Army and Rodsianko is reported to intend to move to ioin Ar&amp;enieff in spite of Yudenitch&apos;s orders to remain.   The delay in supplying munitions and equipment is having a bad effect on the morale of the troops, but the ex German s.s. &quot;Dania&quot; is reported to have arrived at Reval on August 5th and that surplus munitions destined for North Russia are now being diverted to the Baltic.Bolshevik-agents and the pro-Bolshevik local Press in Esthonia have been fostering the idea of Peace between Esthonia and Soviet Russia and this idea is gaining  round. The removal of the Russian N.W. Army towards Pskov will open the front to the Bolsheviks and the Esthonians will have ho option but to make peace.    Latvia will probably follow Esthonia.    The S.N.O., Baltic, General Gough ana Mr. Bosanquet have asked the Government for an immediate statement with regard to the future status of Usthonia.Laiyj a.General Gough wired to Marshal Poch on August 2nd that owing to continued presence of Germans, internal affairs in Latvia were becoming &quot;acute.  Yon der Goliz was give also given a written request1.   To show General Gough his sckamo of evacuation, 2.   Two schemes were suggested, one by sea dnd one bytrain, by which he could clear Latvia by August 20th. 3.  Details were asked for of his strength of armaments. 4.   General Gough refused on behalf of the Allied and Associated Governments to accept Yon der Golt2&apos;s statement that 74 days are needed to evacuate Latvia. Yon der Goltz in reply made the following statements1.   That he refused to show General Gough his scheme of evacuation and that he had received no orders to do so. 2.   That if he had been ordored to fillow General Gough to supervise his evacuation he would have already evacuated Lutiria. 3.   That the evacuation could be carried out in loss than 74 days but that without instructions from his superior he did not intend to shorten the time. General Gough asks, therefore, that Yon der Goltz be given orders to evacuate Latvia by August 20th and that he be allowed to supervise his plans *  Moreover that with the departure of the Germans from Latvia, most of the difficulties which are now insoluble will adjust themselves.    On the other hand Yon der Golt2&apos;s presence creates a very menacing situation&apos;in the Baltic States.General Burt from Riga wires August 6th that Bermont and Wygolitsch refuse to proceed to Narva at present.   They are both Russian Cornmanders, nominally subordinate to Yudenitcn,
but with bro-Gerraan tendencies. The force is about 12,000 oi whom are German, the force is increasing through trans-fers from Lieven1s corps and reinforcements from Germany.   They are well equipped, paid and clothed by Germany through Von der Golts.  . .   ,The Italian Cruiser &quot;Francesco Feruccio&quot; arrived at Dover on 1st August.A leading personage in German shipping circles is quoted as saying &apos;:-&quot;Under present conditions the construction of the German Mercantile Fleet must be a slow matter on account of the defective import of raw materials and increase in workmen1s wages.   Owing to the cost of wages, material, and coal, a newly constructed fleet, even if the restrictions on cargo spade were abolished, could not carry freight at a profit.    Never-theless Germany must try to build up&quot;a small mercantile fleet again, if only to find occupation for the host of unemployed. Meanwhile Germany must try^ to hire merchant ships from Neutral States.    So long as she has no fleet of her own Germany&apos;s proopects of appearing once more in the world1s markets are small&quot;.mssm MissisArchangel.G.0.C wires August 5th that the military situation is Quiet.  There is unrest amongst all mobilised troops, but all&quot;fronts are sufficiently stabilised by presence of British troops to provent trouble of any serious nature.  An operation on the Dwina river, preparatory to withdrawal, is intended about August lOtfnv/hich, if successful, should prevent any possibility of a Bolshevik advance.    The Bolsheviks hold Onega strongly but show no immediate intention of advancing either against Bolsheozerki or along the coast road.  All British personnel taken during the mutiny at Onega are reported to be well treated and are at Vologda, 1 Officer, A.I.F., was killed. It is proposed to evacuate as follows1st batch-  All for Baltic Provinces and Baltic, total about,000, on first transport to clear August 20th. 2nd batch.

Total 0,000 including Polish contingent, 300, at latest date October 1st. 350 Russian infantry and 4 mountain howitzers  British manned, all under Colonel Danilov, sailed July 29th in two Admiralty paddle steamers to capture Onega? on August 1st, under cover of&apos; two monitors, a landing was made.  A Naval party of 1 officer and 3 blueiackets with Lewis Gun and party of 20 British infantry advanced into town a short distance to cover disembarkation bf Russian infantry.    The enemy put uo a strong resistance.  The Monitors shelled and set fire to&apos;tho town. Russian troops would not advance owing to Bolshovik machine gun fire.   Our casualties, 80 killed and wounded.   The force re-embarked at mid-night.   H.K.8. &quot;Mantis&quot; remained in OnegaBay
Bay guarding the entrance to the Onega river.The Government has decided that our support is to be given mainly to Denikin in preference to other anti-Bolshevik fronts.Crenoral Ironside asks whether the Admiralty can take over the  25 k.w. W/T Station at Archangel after September 1st.The Pt.A., &quot;Write Sea, has been&apos;instructed to confer with General Rawlinson with regard to Naval Policy.  The Admiralty consider that all ex Russian Trawlers now manned &quot;by British are British property.  Whether Russian warships, repair ships, etc. are to be destroyed or left in the hands of the Russians must he decided locally.,H.M.3. &quot;Cicala&quot; was mined while in an advance position on the Dwina.   Work of repairing proceeding without beaching. Flotilla anchorage at Troitsa shelled by onomy gun barge.   Gun barge last seen being towed up river after bombing by three seaplanes and fire of &quot;Cicala&quot;.Murmansk.General Rawlinson has ordered that the Soroka position must be defended at all costs.G.Q.C., Kern, wires that on August 2nd a raid by combined sea, land ana air forces was carried out-in order to strike a surprise blow at enemy lake flotilla, recently rein-forced, and to capture the port of Tolvuya, w miles South-East of Medvyeja feora.   Operation was most successful, two enemy steamers captured and one ran ashore, since refloated and although damaged is serviceable.    Tolvuya was captured and also 2U prisoners, including two Officers.  The success had a marked effect on the local population.On August 4th, two successful raids were carried out, the first on railway 8 miles South of Kyapeselga, when the enemy were driven out of two successive positions with loss. The second was 8 miles South East of Kyapeselga and 5 prisoners were captured.It is rumoured that the Bolshevik Commander at Kavgora wishes to go over, and great discontent is reported in enemy lines.BLADK SEA ft MNTOS.,The French Ministry of Marine has given instructions that the Destroyers &quot;Kapitan Sakeu&quot; amd &quot;Bezpokoini&quot; are to be handed back to Senikin.R.A.. Black Sea, reports August 5th that the Bol-sheviks crossed the Dnieper at Aleshki.   &quot;Caradoc&quot; and Russian ships engaged several three inch batteries near Ochuko? and the batteries were silenced.. R.A., Black Sea, states that Caspian transfers are progressing well.     Donikin will probably take over all vessels.  He has accepted liability for payment of hire of Caspian vessels.  Astrakhan operations are progressing more favourably and its capture is probable shortly.    The evacua-,tion of British troops from Krasnovodsk is being covered by the armed vessel &quot;Orlionok&quot;.   Chechen Island has been evacuated and turned over to Russians.Oh August 9th seaplanes and stores have been sent to Guriev. Russian troops have been trapsported to Beryuzak.

It has  however, been decided to leave them  e? there for the present, for fear that their withdrawal would be the signal for further unrest in those districts.Admiral Troubridge is now proceeding to Vienna, in his efforts to organise the Danube traffic.CASPIAN.The Azerbaijan Government have protested against our handing over our fleet to the Russians.  This protest is not unexpected, as this transfer will place Baku at the mercy of the Volunteer Army.    The Georgian Government have also implored us to reconsider our determination to evacuate the Caucasus, and have gone so far as to offer to pay the expenses of our army if we would only leave it, and nave offered us the port of Baioum as a coaling base for our fleet.   The value of Batoyra to us as a coaling base is practically negligible, and it is extremely doubtful if any government in the Caucasus could guarantee the flow of oil in the pipe line.C-in-C, Mediterranean, leave Constantinople on the 5th August in H.M.S. &quot;Iron Duke&quot; for Alexandria to meet General Allenby and R.A., egypt, On 8th August.He leaves Alexandria on 11th August, and arrives at Malta on the 13th.Port Control offices at tfudros and Salonika have been closed.gulf of Tskanderum.

He therefore suggests that his relief should be postponed until the end of the month.    This has been approved.Si the 13th July, tho Commanding Officer of the Greek Cruiser &quot;Helle&quot; informed Commodore, Aegean, that all was not quiet at Aivali as he had fired 800 rounds of 4&quot; shell at the Turks and killed a very large number of them.The Greek Rear Admiral at Constantinople has suggested to M.

Fashitch has submitted a note to the Peace Con-reference. again demanding that Italy should restore to Yugo- , Slavia the fleet of the former Haboburg Monarchy.   It is stated that at the time of the revolution the fleet was pre-sented by Emperor Karl to tho Zagreb National Council, wnicli informed the Entente statesmen of the proceeding.
