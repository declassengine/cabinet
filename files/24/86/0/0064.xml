Thin Document Is&apos;the Property &apos;&apos;pr*.( A)/&apos;Vom Viceroy, Foreign Deparlmciit,9tk August 1910.&apos; (Received lOli, 7,30 a.m.)Clear the line.        , &apos; &apos; 1   &apos;1157 S.   Secret.  -Afghanistan;-  Following from Granl, 8th August&quot; We had information yesterday that Afghan Council &apos;\vere. again &quot;divided, and that there way little prospect of their signing Peace Treaty to-day. - They were upset apparently by our &quot;determination to demarcate whole line from Kabul River to -Sassobi, and Ali Ahmad apparently feared coiisccpicuco for himself if. ho returned tp . Kabul with treaty so disadvantageous to Afghanistan.&apos;   They, asked Nawab Mania Baksh,-however; to go and see them.&apos;&apos; While Maula Baksh was with, them I sent hinr a&apos;copy of Baluchistan telegram 38^&apos;L., of 6th&apos; August, regarding rage of Abdul on . receipt of Ali Ahmad&apos;s letter and possibility of Abdul breaking away from Amir, and told Nawab to inform Afghan delegates of gist of this telegram.   Apparently this had immediate effect on &quot;them, and shortl.v.ilXtenvaxds,,.thev said they would attend to-dav and sign.       - 1&quot; They accordingly appeared here shortly after 10 to-day. The copies of treaty were then compared, and Ali Ahmad made a few more remarks regarding demarcation of (? group omitted, ? frontier). I. again, assured him that demarcation would he on fair and   equitable lines, and he accepted that. He and I then signed, and 1 handed him a letter as follows: &quot; &apos; (I.F.O.C., 1906.) You asked me for some further assuranee(s) that Peace Treaty which the British Government now offer contains nothing that interferes with the complete liberty of Afghanistan either in internal or external matters. My friends, if you will read Treaty carefully yon will see (corrupt group, ? no reasons for) such-interference with the liberty of Afghanistan. (Corrupt group) told me Afgjian Government are williug. to renew arrangement(s) whereby late Amir agreed to follow unreservedly the advice of the British Government in regard to external relations. I have not, therefore, pressed this matter, and no mention is made in the Treaty. Therefore the said Treaty and this letter leaves Afghanistan officially free and independent in its internal and external affairs.&quot; &apos; Moreover, this war has cancelled all previous treaties.&apos; (End of I.F.O.C., 1906.)&quot; I had already, before Receipt of Secretary of State&apos;s telegram of 5th August, shown Ali Ahmad draft letter practically on these lines, and could not therefore amend it as suggested. 1 had intentionally omitted last paragraph of my original draft, (corrupt group) had (corrupt group) clear several times both (corrupt- group) and in writing that friendship and subsidy would, depend largely on way in which Amir conducted his foreign relations and sought and accepted our advice. Ali Ahmad then asked if 1 would publish Treaty. I replied in the affirmative. He next asked if 1 would publish this letter. .1 said I would not, as, if 1 did, the Press might ask for all the letters that had passed between us, which possibly would be incon-venient to him. I said, however, that lie could make what use of this letter he liked in Afghanistan.&quot;After signature, complimentary speeches were made by Sir Shams Shah, Sir Giirbaksh Singh, General Muhammad Yannus and Ghulam Muhammad.&quot;I then made brief address, ending with Viceroy&apos;s message. Copy will be forwarded separately. Ali Ahmad replied, calling attention to need of friendship between two Governments&apos; and expressing satisfaction, so far as he could, with conclusion of peace. It is clear, however, that he does not regard treaty as diplomatic triumph on his side. .&quot;Ali Ahmad then spoke, about repatriation of Afghan detenus and arrangements for Afghan Agency Services, about which I have telegraphed separately.&quot;I asked about British Agent at Kabul, and he said my letter has been delivered to him and that presumably he might stay at Kabul until relieved by his successor. I said that if Ilafiz Saifullah wanted to return, to India at once he must be allowed to do so and that we would arrange about his successor later.&quot;Ali Ahmad promised to act accordingly. He then asked if he might leave an Afghan envoy in India. I said that there was no objection. He said that envoy would probably either (corrupt group) or Abdur Rahman.&apos;&quot; We then discussed their journey, and arranged for them to leave on Monday night.   I then invited them to garden party here to-morrow, and meeting broke up.&quot; Addressed to Foreign, repeated to Private Secretary to Viceroy and Chief of General Staff.&quot;
We regard result el peace negotiations as highly satisfactory. With a few modifications, none of which is essential, our draft treaty has been accepted in full by Afghan delegates. For our. success we are indebted to the admirable patience and tact and skill with which Grant, ably assisted by his associates, notably Maffcy, has conducted throughout, despite obstacles and difficulties raised loy Afghan del eg ales at every turn. While we realise that we have embarked on nature of an experiment, we ourselves believe that it !may well prove in the end more satisfactory and successful than the old arrangement/Much will depend on way Afghan -Government is handled. They are very sensitive of the outward shadow of their liberties, but if due allowance is iiiade for this, we feel confident that there is every chance that they will eventually seek our advice Of their own accord in es&amp;entiai matters.   Text of Treaty is being published here. ,
