(gJL 34)Q T   79^)        EXTRACT from the Notes of a Meeting-        of the Heads of Delegations of theFive Great Fewera, held in M. Pichcn&apos;s Boom at the tymi d&apos;firstly, Paris, on TUESDAY, AUGUST 5, 1919 at 3.3A P.m.X X XX X3. .   Mr,-Hoover made the following statement ONPE.,. &quot;1 desire to again raise to the Council thedeal situation in Europe.Under the direction of the Supreme Council and   the Supreme Economic Council, my Mmlnla.tra^. tion undertook the promotion of product ion and so fail for as.possible to control the distribution of coal during the Armistice in Central and  -astern Europe,    A considerable staff has been oafJEttyed, upon this labour end numerous. agreements   sM under-takings entered, upon, involving the old. 8tats&amp; ef Austria, the Balkans, Poland and to some extent Germany.    While the result could not t*a l&amp;e&amp;L they have at le&amp;st served to maintain ffi^ficient ^oppli&amp;a ror the transportation of municipal and d&amp;mestio eervicee neoeasory to maintain life.    Wit&amp; the erolng of the Armiatioe (and this, authority) and with the supers-imposition ef the. feapajraUon Commieeion over a considerable part of this problem, the supervision which we have exerted must :aeoe&amp;-sarily cea^e.Colonel A.G. Goodyear and Colonel W.G. Atwood^ Of our staff have compiled a summary (See Appendix &quot;G&apos;0 of ih-Q 1915 production and consumption of the principal oruntries in Europe (^mlii&amp;ing Suaaia and tha Balkan ijtate$)and have also conducted a careful inquiry into the probable production during^ tjaa year 1919, baesd upon the expedience of the ^ir^t cix months of the year.    &apos;J)he net result Jhotfs that, from a pmluotion of about 679,500,$00 ions in the uviiioipal oo untriea in Europa (except (ussia) the production in these States has fallen io a rate of about 443,000,000 tons per annum.-&quot; )t the 1913 production above mentioned, about 614,000,000 tons were consumed in these States (i.e, outside the Balkan States and export marketB foreign to Europe).    In other words, the production/
has fallen approximately 236,500,000 tone or down to 65$ of normal production.   Tho consumption cannot be decreased in this ratio (35$) upon oer-tain vital consumers, such as transportation and municipal and other eosonilal services, so-that a shortage for manvrfacoivj and household use must be on a far greater .ca/&apos;.o,   Beyond this., the very natural tendency ox? proci.uo.ttye countries to reserve a larger degree of their normal con-sumption will and does result in an under-supply, to the non-producing countries far below  a ttofo reduotionu      furthermore, the summer acc-ampliation against winter use hus not oeen in progress and therefore the hardships of the coming winter are even further increased.&apos;   It seems almost unnecessary to repeat the causes of this diminished production but they may be again summarised as due to certain specific causes whioh in fact are much      the same in all productive industries^To a minor degree, compared with the whole, there has been a loss of equipment and skill, due,to the war;   there has been a retarda-tion of advance exploitation during the war; there has been a relaxation of effort as a reflex from the physical exhaustion of largo sections of the population through privations and the mental and physical strain of the war;   there is a shortage of railway rolling; stock for prompt movement from the mines;,  there has been an on-set t lenient of political destiny of a number of coalfields by the peace terms;   and, above:all,. the proper and insistent demand of labour for higher standards of living in the genoral unbalance of economic conditions has been msni-fe.3t.ed in repeated strikes and other deterrents to production*      Unfortunately European labour at many points has become infected with   the theory that the limitation of effort below physical necessity and the obstruction of labour-saving devices v/ill increase thoir own comfort -and improve their conditions.   In turn, the re-eotibhs1 from undue profits earned by proprietors during the&apos;war has brought&quot; a shook to the theory of private ownership/ which:has discouraged  , further investment ar.d consequently a renewed opening of new,areas which the maintenance of production demahas.    Ill   these causes are operating to - varying degree in different local-ties but their summation is shortage of pro-duction below, the .living necessity of tjia population of Europe. .With the arrival of a harvest and thus the solution of immediate food pressure, the problem of ooal now comes to the front as the greatest menace to the Stability and life in Europe.   It is ** problem domestic to Europe and incapable of 8&amp;3,u&apos;;ion from the limited States.
Disregarding all other questions, an additional load of 1,000,000 tons per month on American ports would indeed be a largo tax in tho face of the trebling of tho United States food exports above pre-war normal.   I*!urthormoro 3 even such a tonnage would entail a.tax on the worldVg shipping that cannot but affect freight rates generally.     With a shortage in production of 20,000,000 tons per month a contribution of oven double this amount from the United States would be but,little help.The solution of the problem doiaan&amp;g, &quot;fjjret, increased production and second, organisation of distribution..It would perhaps contribute to tho first 1 problem if the coal miners and coal owners of all Europe could be brought to a realisation that the fate of European civilisation now rests in their hands to a degree equal to - if not greater than -in the hands of providers of food supplies during the next year.The solution of the second problem ** distribution - is vital if the  non-producing States are not to collapse and in its conduct it should be possible to force tho maximum production in those States who are partially . supplied,I urgently recommend that somo a form of ooal oontrol should be set up in Europe with //lew to the stimulation of production and to secure a dis-tribution that will maintain the essential sorvioos upon which.economic and political stability must re3t.   The problem cannot be solved for any one Suropean country alone but the   energies of all must be enlisted and the position of all must be considered.   It is purely a domestic problem for Europe.He therefore proposed the following Resolutions&quot;That tho Supreme Oouaoil should invite the British, irenoh, Italian, Belgian, Polish and Czecho-Slovax Governments each to nominate one member to a European Goal Commission to bo immediately set up to undertake the oo-ordina-tion of the production, distribution and trana-portation of coal throughout Europe.   Tho Reparation Commission, the Sese-han Commicsions the Pleb&amp;oits Commission for Silesia, and the different oOMflissions charged with matters of transport by sea, railroad and canal, should all be instructed to co-oporato with this Ooal Commission and to assist the work of the Coal Commission to the full extent of their powers.&quot;
&apos;:R. LOUCHBUR agreed with Mr, Hoover except in one particular.   He considered that the United States should be represented upon the proposed Commission.MR. HOOVER&apos;stated that American representation had be omitted because it was felt that this matter was a domestic problem of Europe.   Furthermore, the United States was faced with a crisis at Home.   At the best., the United States could only ship to Europe about 500,000 tons in a year, by reason of Port troubles and lack of shipping.   As the production of. coal in Europe had declined 25/;. this assistance was negligible. Under the authority of the Council he had been concerned with the coal production in Central and Eastern Europe, but the Reparation Commission set up under the Treaty was now tahing charge of the mines, and his own work was therefore coming, to an end,, MR, BALFOUR said that he was now quite sure that he understood What Mr, Hoover meant by saying that the coal crisis was a European domestic problem.   As the British representative, he might in the same way say that the problems of continental Europe were domestic problems in which Great Britain was not concerned.   In reality, ail countries of the world were interdependent, and their mutual interests in one another*s condition had never been better understood than by Mr, Hoover himself.   Therefore, he did not quite followHooverfs reasoning&apos;in excluding America from representation on the Commission.   He had no doubt, however, that the Port and Shipping difficulties mentioned by Mr. Hoover made it difficult for America to do all she would wish to do to help Europe.   One portion of the Resolution proposed by Mr. Hoover appeared to him a little obscure.   He alluded to the passage in.which it was said that the Commission
should &quot;undertake the co-ordination of the production, distribution and transportation of coal throughout Europe&quot;. Did this mean that the Commission v/ould take charge for Instance,0f the Belgian coalfields and the coalfields of Northern Prance ?   Would it attempt to regulate the con-ditions of production in England ?   As was well known to the Council, it was difficult to obtain coal from English coalfields even to keep British industries going,   In what manner could the proposed Commission intervene in the internal affairs of the various countries ?MR. HOOVER said that the question of the sovereignty of Commissions of this kind had always proved an insuperable difficulty.   In practice, it had always been agreed that such Commissions had no authority.   No Government could give a right, even to its representative, to dispose of its national resources.   The Commissions     therefore, confined themselves to giving advice as to ways and means, and the best methods of co-ordination.&quot; For instance, Germany was in a position to produce more coal than was required of her for indemnity purposes and for home consumption.   Italy had offered a supply of skilled workmen; by offering a bonus on production, a surplus could be obtained for the benefit of the world at large.   In Silesia, on the other hand, the production of coal had diminshed 50/? by reason of the political situation in that area.   The Relief Commission which had formerly controlled the production of cool in Silesia had been superseded by the Plebescite Commission; the resulting situation had had a detrimental effect on the output.   t n Tschen for similar reasons the production of coal had also diminished. The political situation there had re-acted on the mines. O&amp;echo-Slovakia produced an excess of brown coal.   This coal was useless for transportation purposes but was employed
in certain industries vhich by reason cf the political situation could not obtdn it, and were now using black coal0 -An exchange cf this brown coal for black coal could be suggested as a means of obtaining a more profitable distribution, In fact, the Commission could suggest many ways of.ccoordination which the ordinary play of political affairs impededoilki LOUCHEUR suggested that if an American Member could not be appointed id the Commission, Mr. Hoover&apos;s Agents should at.least be allowed to continue their work in Poland and Czecho-Slsvakia0MR. HOOVER said that he thought perhaps a solution could be found if he were allowed time for consultation, with Mr. Polk.-M. TITTONI suggested that Mr... Hoover might at least; continue his activities- for, the first six months of the operations of the Commission.MR. balfour said that he was in entire agreement.MR. POLK asked that,the cgestion should be left open for a decision between himself,. Mr. Heover and Mr. Loucheur..It was then resolved:-&quot; That the Supreme Council should invite the -British,. French, Italian,. Belgian,, Polish and Czecho-Slovsk   Governments each to nominate one member to a European Coal Commission to-be immediately set up to undertake the co-* ordination of the production, distribution, and transportation of coal throughout. Europe.. The Reparation Commission, the Teschen Commission the Plebiscite Com ission, tov Silesia, and. dif-ferent Co.: missions changed with matters of &apos; transport by sea,, railroad and canal, should all be instructed to co-operate with this Coal Commission and to assist the work of the Coal Ccmmission to the full extent of their powers.&quot;It was further decided:-That Mr. Padx Mr. Hoover and M. Loucheur should confer regarding American repres , sentation on this Commission.
