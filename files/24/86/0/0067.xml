(THIS. DOCUMENT. IS THE PROPERTY 0? HIS BRITANNIC, MAJESTY1 S 60vT2R3fM?NT)SBC R&apos; B T.G.T,7964. W,A &amp; . 0 A B I IT E T4 c46Memorandum by lord Sumner with reference to GPT.-79Q7.The Report is only a sketch and does not set out in full its framers&apos; reasons and arguments, but, at the risk of doing: them less tfcan justice, to venture the following observations - p(ypnorb 11-7?-(a) It contemplates a Secretariat and a Bureau, which will tend to be the colleagues and not the subordinates of the Commission end may even become its masters instead of its servants:(b) It either  oes too far or not far enough;   it does more than organise the machinery, which the uommis^ioa will need before it can start its own discussion st all, survey its task for itself, ani frame its organisation accordingly;   but it does leas than complete the entire organisation, waieh sooner or later the Commission will require;(o)   It unduly tl;as the hands of each Nation represented and needlbssly requires each Nation to conform to a common, plan.-  The efioct of this will be to set up the CommissioUi as&quot; an authority distinct from the governments vtho send Delegates to it, and create the idea, that it is an independent&apos; tribunal or an International jurisdic-tion, a very dangerous thing.     The Commission is and always must be a mere delegacy.As to (a)&quot;the various experts of the different national organisations should pi.epsr% the material for the deliberations of the        * Commission.&quot;&quot;Inter-allied Committees and bub-Committees should be appointed to perform or prepare the work of the Commission (General principle [bfP&quot;&apos;Bie Secretariat should be a. Committee of the Secretaries of the different National organisations, which would meet for the decision of all pendin, questions&quot;.     &quot;The General Secretary should have the direction of the Staff in ail routine matters:   in all other matters he should be required to consult the Committe of Secretaries, to whom he &quot;would be respond bis&quot; (Scheme and Organisation. - A. oecretaricit*.&quot;Bach of the Inter-allied Services should be controlled by a Committee consisting of the heads of the Technical Services concerned b.&apos;*the varior r National Organisations.&quot; pchomV  and Organisation. B. Services and Divisions).-
&quot;As the method of voting and the representation of tho various countries on the Reparation Commission is definatciy laid down in the Treaty ... the various Committees and Suh-Committees^W&apos; should be fprimed and should act on the same principle(General Principles!e) )&quot;The Committees controlling the work of the divisionsorganised for the purpose of carrying out tho work of the Service should be on the same model and their chairman and officials should be appointed in tho same manner and under the same conditions&quot;(Scheme of  Organisation   B. Serviced and Divisions ..) .These quotations show that a series.. of Departments is contem-plated, similarly organis d, equal in importance, directing the work of their subordinates, preparing; the commissions work and thus really guiding its deliberations *They are united by a Secretariat, which &quot;moots for the decision of all pending questions&quot;., and the General Secretary is respon-sible to a Committee of particular Secretaries, of which he may rot even be a member.It is true that thaso functionaries are not left without some contact with the Commission, for &quot;each Committee or Sub-committoe is to have a chairman, appointed by the commission from amongst its own members&quot; (so those chairman will be pretty busy, if they do not stop away)   but the Chairman will be &quot;largely in the hands of our  Exocutivepffioo^whonagfct also bo Secretary&quot;(Scheme of Organisation B Services) (General Principles C. )They will, however, have to serve a good many masters, for in addition   &quot;Each of the Inter Allied Services of the Commission should bo controlled by a Committee consisting of tho Heads of the Technical Services(Scheme of Organisation B).I think there is great danger in these co-equal Departments variously supervised by various sub-ordinates.     They will be beyond the control of the Commission..  It is to the Commission that tho General Secretary should alone bo responsible      it is for the Commission to say What it wants prepared    it is for tho Commission to decide all questions,cx-cept such as it finds it expedient to depute for itself to its Officers from time to time.There is no noed for these Commit tees to bo all of one pattern Some will bo  arge and semi^-permanent, e.g. Ill (c) Labour Supplies; others very temporary, o,g. II (a)l. Subdivision for claims for personal damage, or almost insignificant o.g. Ill (-a) -objects of artistic interest and III (d) Cables.Except for tho initial secretariat and staff, without which tho Commission cannot start, I think the commission should frame its own organisation to fit   its work and its policy and if it is wise, it will keep anything flexible and interchangeable, until it learns for itself what it has to do.I recognise that, if it is not wise, it will waste in wrangle about organisation th^timc it should give to its principal duties.     I recognise foliat the French also want to begin with Reglements and Frincipou.     evolved a priori and with an appearance of symmetry,and have a horror of leaving things to be settled when the questions arise, but I dread prematureoast-iron arrangements, and I dread lest these Delegates should get to be independent of their Governments and become dependent on bureaux and Committees, who will jroally be responsible to tobody but one another..
li 0 Au to (b)The ;:chemo in open to criticism In itc--detail-e of tho Service and Divisions, as followsThe Finance Service is too Indefinite a.,..&apos; there is a good deal of overlap between the Treasury Division and the Cashierrs Division,, and these details of office management could be better settled later on..It does not go far enough on the other hand. VJhat Division will deal with the Assets Realisation bUbiness, and what organisation of agents and advisors is contemplated for this important purpose ?How will the different \7ar Offices keep tho peace with the Reparation Commission^ if its Treasury Division has more than a formal connexion with the presentation of the Armies of Occupationj and,, if it has not,,wlr does this detail figure in the scheme ?  .The Valuation Service Involvea considerable overlap;. The value of many securities is dependent on tho value of the goods charged.. The valuation of claims for damage to property Is certain to produce grounds for collision with the Labour &amp; Supplies Division of part III, Restitution and Reparation in kind.. There is no machinery for valuing the sums to be allowed for labour.and materials supplied by Germany against the amount of the claims admitted and proved against Germany..There is also no machinery for dealing with the Identification and recovery of stolen articles, other than objects of artistic, historic or scientific interest, which are to be promptly returned to the owners under the Treaty..One of the great dangers to which the Cora-mi tilS&amp;Ba will be exposed is leakage of Information and corruption of inferior officials., Early knowledge of what the Commission is likely to do,.and indirect means of influencing its decisions will be sought after by financiers and others eagerly^ .There will be no lack of temptation and some will fall., The Commission in the long run must s$t its own house in order and keep a watch on   its members, as well as on its servants. , This scheme,.however,.has no suggestions for this indispensable service..After all,.if the Commission starts with good men and plenty of them and a good Secretary,.and if it means business Itself, it can always shift its men about and&apos;brigade them as required.. Of course,.if everything is to be done on principles of equal representation,. and everybody is quintuplicated every time, the thing will never work...I do not see the object of XV, Legal Service,, IThat do they want with all these lawyers ?   If they cannot interpret the Reparation clauses themselves, . the Delegates should ask their Governments what they want..As to Legal Experts investigating &quot;future sanction incases of non-fulfilment of obligations undor the Treaty&quot;, this invades the Sovereignty, of tho Nations and sets up an independent international tribunal by a side wind, .which will never do..
As to (c)Great Britain at least must be free to employ as many men as she chooses and pay thorn what she likes.   Are v;o to go without the best men, because Belgium adheres to a rate of pay that will not secure their services ?   Are we to be restr selected in our choice of Delegates, becao.se we cannot equip our representative with as much assistance as lie needs and in any shape we choose ?All that is necessary is to limit the amount to bo claimed against Germany for expenses of tho Commission, so as to avoid a scramble among the powers to sec who can get most,   It will never do to conform to Continental patterns.., instead of staffing our Delegation as wo think best, and at our own&quot;expense, and so as to keep It subordinate to our own Government.(Sgd)   STJIsNER,Oth August, 1919,
