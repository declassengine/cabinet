li.....ftEPORT OP THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON /TRANSPORT. - A,n .(Metropolitan Area)Memorandum for the War Cabinet By Sir Eric Qeddea.The report of the Committee on -London Transport emphasises the need, which is generally admitted, for co-ordination of the control of passenger traffic in London under one Authority, and the evidence taken shows that the congestion at present existing is so serious and lnf liots such hardship on the travelling public that Immediate, -action must be taken.With the general conclusions of the Committee as to the urgency of the problem I am in agreement * tout I cannot accept their suggestion as to the means for securing effective action.The Committee propose to set up an Authority with statutory powers, not under the direct control of any Minister, &quot;but reporting to Parliament through the Home Secretary.    To this Authority are to he entrusted the powers at present exercised by the Board of Trade, the Local Government Board and the Home Office, the majority of which would bo transferred under the Ways wad Communications Bill to the new Ministry.    The creation of a seml^independent Authority appears most undesirable, particularly at the present time, when the authority of Parliament needs to be emphasised, and when a spec ill Department charged with Transportation is being set up*    Whatever authority is set up must be fully responsible to a Minister.As the powers recommended as necessary for the control of London traffic comprise those general powers which will be given to the Minister of Ways and Communications, with considerable additions, it is clear that the Minister, and not the Home Secretary, must be
responsible,    In view, however, of the powers which willbo given to and the creation of the Ministry of ways and communications, it does not appear necessary to sotup any other netr Authority.Examining tho $ropoeala of the Committee, itappears that the new Authority, with powers proposed,would not be in a position tfr enforce the reforms whichare required.   These may be broadly divided into(1)     Supervision of read and street construction and improvements in order that all schemes shall conform to a general plan to meet London traffic needs,(2)     po-ordination of services of existing and cf newmeans of transport (tubes., sncurban railway services tramways and onprlbusea), with the object of ensuring an adequate r*er\.U:e at reaper able fares?, cf avoiding unnecessary and coutly competition of regu.lating rouctes and, of securing economies in working.As regards (1), the Road Board, which will be incorporated with the Ministry of Ways and Communications,., has already prepared, in collaboration with Local Authorities, several important schemes which await authoritative backing an&amp; in some cases financial assist-ance.    The new Authority proposed will not have any financial responsibility, and it is difficult to see how any material improvement can be effected without money whoever is to provide it.    In practice an. appeal would have to be made to the Ministry of Ways and Communications to carry out the &quot;dicta&quot; of the new Authority.As regards (2), the same difficulty* that the Authority would have no financial responsibility, would make them impotent to enforce their suggestions.  v If they deBire to restrict competitive service a, they must assume some responsibility for tho financial results of the policy they desire to impose.Further, in order to exercise their powers, the Authority would require to appoint a highly technical
staff, rrhose work would merely duplicate that of the centralised staff In the Ministry of Ways and Communications. Such duplication could only irritate the Local Authorities: and would certainly woke strong criticism and additionalQOSttThe problem of London transport, although itpossesses special features, is only a part of the problemof transport as a whole.     The proposed area for the nowAuthority dees not extend even to the limits of existingsuburban traffic and with.every new development that area will be widened.X desire to make the following suggestions :*(3.)   That the Minister of Ways and Communications should be instructed to utilise at onoo the powers which he will acquire to cine.:, with the Traffic Problem, as regards the Metropolitan(area.(2)  That an Advisory&apos;Committee,, consisting ofrepresentatives of tho travelling public, of the Local Authorities-concerned,, and of the transport undertakings, should be appointed by this Minister to assist him,(3)   That in the next Session of Parliament, a Billshould be introduced to extend the powers already passing Into law, &quot;and whioh will,, it is expected, shortly ho possessed by thy Minister of Ways and Ccromunioations over railways and private tramways to tramways owned by a Public Authority and to Ctaibus Companies in the Metropolitan area.. The Bill should also provide certain powers which at present do not exist to regulate the movement of vehicular traffic and to regulate road repair and the breaking tip of streets.This Bill can be prepared during the recess in the new Ministry when it is set up.(Sfcd.)
