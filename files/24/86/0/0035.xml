Discharged soldiers are attempting to bring out the Manchester Polioe and to persuade some of the Unions to strike in sympathy.   Generally, howover, the Union is discredited.The  brbremists have done their best *o use the Polioe Strike for an attack upon all institutions and to persuade labour that the Polioe Bill is a oovert threat upon the liberties of the working man.   The appeal has so far failed.The holidays are always a bod time for agitators and audiences have been smaller than usual.The situation in the Yorkshire Coal Fields iB unchanged.   The . miners generally are reported to wish to return to work, but are intimidated by the extremists, and this is said to be the reason why the leaders refuse to take a ballot.The Bakers&apos; Strike has oaused less hardship than was expected, because the non-union men and mastexvbokers are providing a limited supply of bread, .: * *The high prices and the laok of housing is causing exasperation but the promised Bill may do something towards restoring public   oonfidenoe.   There is a strong feeling that the local authorities are lethargic in dealing with the Housing problem, and the agitators are making the best use of this.There/
There is a slight improvement in the temper among Discharged Soldiers.  The increased pensions have given satisfaction, and It Is possible that they may oontinue to hold aloof from the more advanced labour organizations.afoe Irish Republican Brotherhood is believed to be behind t organised campaign of outrage egainst polloe officers in Ireland, who are doing their duty.  There is friction between the Sinn Pel farmers and the Irish Transport Union, which is starting the str of Agricultural Y/orkers in harvest time.  This rift seems likely grow.Ex-Inspeotor Desseht, one of the leaders of the Polio c StrikI in London, is now detainod in Haokney Infirmary as a lunatio.   Ou of 1,012 Metropolitan Polioo on strike, 17,2$ served in the Army before the&apos;ITar, 24.3$ served, during the-.Warv and 43 have joined tj Poro^sinoe January.   The average oervloe of the strikers is 9*3 I years.
-POLICE STRIKE!There is.a prevailing belief that the polios strike was engineered by the revolutionaries in this country as a prelude to a general attempt to upset the social order. I believe this to be only partly true.   Ihe real cause of the strike was the certitude in the minds of the leaders &apos; that if the Police Bill became low the Police Union, from which they drew their salaries, would cease to exist within three months.   They have for some time been telling their intimates that something drastic must be done if the Union was to survive.   Policemen are notoriously slow in their apprehension of the trend of political movements, and the Union officials, who are all policemen, interpreted the applause they received from extreme Labour to mean thatthey would have the active support of:all the important unions,   as soon as the strike was declared, the extremists,led by the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, felt that the hour for therevolution of which they have all been dreaming had struck,and they have don9 everything in their power, by encourage-ment and direct falsehood, to bring about extensive strikes in the vital industries: that they have not suooeeded shows the innate good sense and moderation of the English workingman,Except in Liverpool, where there is a strong disorderly Irish element, the strike has signally failed.   It is now known that the engine-drivers who came out on the South Western struok only because they were assured that 5,000 policemen were out and 5,000 more were about to Join them, and it now seems likely that they will return to work before the end of the week.Though the great body of the men condemn the Union, there is still some opposition to the Police Bill.   at manchester/
- 2. - (X&apos;.Manchester on August 5th, while disovming tho Union jJbseoutiv a large mooting of policemen1&quot; resolved to ask the Government to reoeive a deputation on the Bill, and some fooling has been manifested in Birmingham.   On the other hand, at the *! ;meeting of the South Shields Borough Polio0 on August 3rd, it ms deoiciod that the local members of the Police- Union should resign their membership e^Juoq and the act of the Exeoutive was condemned.   Similar action has been taken by the Bristol Polioe.Liverpool still remains the strong oentre.   The language of the speakers at the strike meetings has been violent; a prinoipal agitator is ex-Polioe Constable - . SKITHWICK.Though it is not quite certain that sympathetic strikes will not be oal3.ed in Liverpool and other plaoeo on the question of the reinstatement of the strikers - the point to which their sympathisers are now devoting them-selveo - the strike may be Bald to have cleared the air and purged the Police of a very undesirable element.A meeting was held under tho auspices of the Polioe Union at Birmingham on August 5th.   The audienoe numbered 5 00 to 600 and most of the speakers confined themselves to an appeal against rioting and disorder.Ex-Sergeant-Major Blythe of the National Union of Ex-Seryioe Men, moved the following resolution, whioh was carried unanimously by show of hands:-&quot;That this liase Meeting will endeavour to approach all Trade Unions in this country and ask them to down tools at once until the Government recognises the Polioe and Prison Officers Union, and, furthermore, demand tho resignation of Mr. Shortt, the Home Seoretary and instant dismissal of Sir Nevil macready.&quot;
1 iJ 9THE COAL QUESTION        -As a result of the meeting between masters- and men at Sheffield on August 6th both sides decided to send a joint letter to the Coal Controller, requesting him to meet them in order that an explanation may be given of the grounds which led to an agreement&apos;of 14.3 inorease on July 14th.   This move constitutes, at present, the only hope that the deadlock may oome to an end. - -&quot;&apos; -.  There has been very little openobjection to the presence of Naval ratings, but the Uniori&apos;Officials are examining with particular oare the olass of work done by Naval men, evidently in the hope of finding ground for complaint.lily correspondent reports that the miners generally say they wish to return to work, but the extremists1 are intimidating them to such ah extent that the men dare not vote against them afc open branch meetings.-&quot;&quot;This fact is given as the reason why the leaders refuse to take a ballot.THE TRIPLE IiTOSTElAL ALLIANCE AND DIRSCT ACTION :Owing to the holidays there has been very little .     activity, amongst the members of the Allianoe.   Ballot papers, are being prepared,, but it is unlikely that thoy will be circulated until all the men are back at work.   Sxtremist organizations are doing their utmost to obtain a ballot favourable to their views, and some indioation of the use to whioh revolutionaries will endeavour to put&apos; a strike of tho Triple Alliance:was/
was given by Gallaoher in a speech at Sheffield on July 27th:   &quot;If the working olaos do not take full advantage of the opportunity.which will be given to establish a new form of society when the Triple Allianoo takes direct aotion, they, the workers and their children, will fall baok into the worst forms of capitalistic slavery for many years to come,&quot;It is reported that Bristol Railwaymen are much exercised by Mr. J. H. Thomas&apos; condemnation of direct aotion. They consider that they should be allowed to ballot on the question.My correspondent reports that the ballot in the Leeds district will probably show a large majority for direct action.iir. V/, Weir, Pro s id en t of the Northumberland Miners Association, stated at Hexham on August jfrd that there is no line of demarcation betwoen Industrial and political questions.THE? LIGHTifllTQ- STRIKEAn increase in the number of lightning strikes is notiooable. These strikes are evidenoe of the growing impatience with established Trade Union prooedure.The most recent instances are those &apos;of the Railwaymen at Nine Elms, of the Agricultural workers in Shropshire, of the Aldershot and District Traotion Company^ employees at Aldershot and of the City &amp; South London&apos; fee workers,LfiEDS , r.jIn.Leeds the Independent Labour Party and the BritishSooialist Party are reported to be gaining ground.   Ther* is a marked increase in the&apos; attendance of respeotablepeople/
- 5 -(English J -103people at extremist meetings.   Mr. Weil Maclean, M.P., and R.C Wallhead have been speaking in the distriot and extremists greet the Polioe Strike as the beginning of revolution.My correspondent states that the presenoe of Naval and Military Foroes has been worth many months of propaganda to the extremists.My correspondent reports that there is considerable unrest in Bristol; he states that in the working districts the word &quot;Revolution&quot; is on almost every tongue, though ideas as to the object against whioh the.revolution will be direoted are decidedly vogue.Profiteering is almost entirely responsible for this unrest and the worst offenders are the small shopkeepers and publicans.   Agitators with preposterous eoonomio theories and the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; odd fuel to the fire.The people are reported to be sick of Russia and every-thing connected with the country.THE FEELING- AMONG DISCHARGED SOLDIERS&apos;A slight improvement has taken piaoe in the attitude of discharged men.   This is probably due to the promised increase in pensions, and as the Increases beoome more widely known it should beoome more marked.The following, details reflect the feeling in various ; distriots.In South Wales they.are, on the whole, quite loyal, though&apos; they find it difficult to live on their pensions.In Leeds and York they are showing determined opposition to socialist meetings.In/
mm    6   -In Bristol, where&quot; there are 8,000 to 9,000 disoharged men, they are divided Into&apos;various organizations; these organizations are stated to be self-supporting and quite dissooiated from labour or political bodies. There is, however, some feeling against the Trade Unions. Many demobilized volunteers complain that the shirkers are deriving an&quot;unfair advantage and that employers are taking advantage of the men&apos;s pensions and are offering wages upoi ,. which the men oould not possibly live. Local Trade Unionii m,.   are said to be distrustful of the. Government&apos;s quiok train;-scheme. .:. ..&apos;&apos;/,-;.At Sheffield on July 26th some 20,000 members of the looal branch of the National Federation of Disoharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers held a demonstration to draw attention to their grievanoea, particularly to their demand for an. increased gratuity,   As individual members ovthe Federation seemed likely to oause disorders, it was arranged that the men should hold their meeting in one of City Parks, and that the Jbord Mayor should address them. These measures, whinh gave satisfaction to the leaders, resulted in. quite orderly proceedings.   Some of the men assisted the police to patrol the streets in the evening,jI am reliably informed that the main.grlevanoe in j Sheffield is the inadequacy of gratuities. My correspond^ is of opinion that disintegration of the local branoh woul follow any adjustment of this grievance, which is the soli bond between men of divergent political and social views.Some bitterness was shown at Islington on August 1st when a deputation of disoharged soldiers accused the Boroi Council of offering smaller wages to pensioned men.Disoharged men at Stoke-on-Trent have lodged a protei against examination by Army doctors.   They oonsider that
(English)-.......   jeqon independent private practitioner should examine them for pension purposes.Disturbances have been oaused in Salford by an agitator named Joshua Batty, who was oonvioted several times between 1906 v*nd 1910 for obstruction and inoitement to riot.   This man has only a small following and is repudiated by the main branoh of the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilized Sailors and 3olaiers in Salford.   The Mayor of Salford refused Batty permission to hold meetings in Bexley aquare, where they would interfere with traffic   After preliminary meetings and deputations to the Town Hall, Batty defied the order on July 28th.   The Square was cleared and held by 50 polioe and no further disturbance has occurred.Like that of the Manchester branch of the Federation, Batty1s programme is a minimum unemployment grant of  2 and the abolition of the new regulation that all ex-soldiers drawing the grant shall sign on at a Labour Exchange four times weekly.The counter-demonatration and mass meeting arranged by th,e Sx-Servioe men on the occasion of the Glasgow Offioial Peace Celebrations on August 4th was a,complete fiasco.   The Procession started with not more than 2,000 demonstrators. -  There were about 100 Labour representatives present, but after ,   a short time they melted away, aid even Councillor Dollan admitted that the proceedings were a &quot;wash out&quot;.TEE PEOPLE^ RUSSIA IKPOJ^ATIOM BUREAUAbout 220 delegates, representing Railwaymen, Transport Workers, Electricians and other industrial and politioal bodies, attended the Conference of the people&apos;s Russian Information Bureau on July 26th.The objects of the Conference were:-(1)   To inform the delegates regarding the &quot;real position&apos; in Russia.
M      3     M(EngliBh)(2)   To impress upon thein the urgent neoessity of ascertaining the best means of forcing the Government to. abstain from, intervention.The most important speakers, were the Indian, Saklatvala,a Parses, and a nephew of the,late Sir R. Tata, who has beenprominent in almost all the revolutionary organizations in thiscountry, and &amp;r,. Joseph King.   The former delivered a veryrevolutionary speeoh, which, w^s well received; the latter,though urging more peaoeful methods, such as daily correspond enwith-Members of Parliament * stated th;Vt he is a member of the- Bureau., . . .The Bureau, whioh purveys &quot;news&quot; favourable to the Sovietgovernment, seems to be increasing in importance and iscertainly doing harm.   The previous oonferenoe, four months agowas attended by -only 60 people,THE WQjftK3R3* CIBCLfl &apos;  &quot;&apos; &apos;       : &apos;It is reported that the !Jewish Brtinoh of tho British Sooialist Party, which has beoome almost negligible owing to tae deportation of Russians, is to be dissolved and to beoome a branoh of the &quot;Workers1 Girole&quot;It is thought that as the &quot;Workers1 Girole&quot; Is registered as a Friendly Society it will not be suspeoteid, and will serve as cloak for the members&apos; activities.   Negotiations for tho formation of the Branch are ii progress.Mr. tom mmTom Mann is one of the two candidates for the final ballot for the General Secretary ship of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers; the other is J. Kaylor, who in the preliminary ballc was some 4,000 votes behind ton.   Mann had a very, hostile reception at Treorchy, where he was billed to give a lecture on July 29th.   He stated, &quot;I am the man that is going to get you five days a week and more than  1 a day, but this oan only begot/
got by you sticking to ma.&quot;   At this there wsjg considerable interruption from discharged soldiers, who shouted, &quot;VJe don&apos;t want you to fight for Us.   Send Lloyd George here, he is the man we want.&quot;   Mann replied, &quot;Yes, he is the man to send you to Russia and to oonsoript you,&quot;   To this there were shouts of &quot;We didn&apos;t wait to be conscripted.&quot; The &quot;Red Flag&quot; was 3ung but the discharged soldiers struck up The national Anthem and &quot;Rule Britannia&quot; and rushed the stage.   Mann and his supporters escaped by a side dcor, but were followed by a hostile crswd and eventually escorted to a tram oar by the Police, but for some hours afterwards the streets were crowded and the feeling exhibited against Bolshevists was most pronounced.   About 800 were present at the Leoture*It is reported in to-d?,y!s press that the Polioe strikers have called Mann to their aid.   It will be remembered that Mann was the manager-in-ohief of the Railway strike some eight years ago.Mr. Noah Ablett, the prinoipal speaker at a .-Hands off Russia&quot; Meeting at Ton Pentre, had a some?,&apos;h3,t similar experience.CONVICTIONMatthew Kavanagh, an extremist member of the Communist League, was fined  2 at Marlborough Street on July 3.0th for U3ing insulting words and behaviour in Hyde Park on July 29th.glNN FEIN IN TOL-AWPA meeting of about 6,000 Sinn Fainers, at whioh there was slight opposition, was held in ManoheBter on July 27th. Mrs. SHEBHY-SNEFFINGTON and Mr. Joseph MaoDonagh, M.P.,were/
IRELANDThe most serious feature for the moment is the ser of organised and murderous attaoks upon police offioeral f especially those who have made themselves obnoxious by fearless discharge of their duty.    Behind these outrag stands the terrorist gang known as the Irish Republioon Brotherhood.   The spirit of the Police is admirable atpresent/were the chief speakers, Both inveighed against Britain the familiar Sinn Fain manner and&amp;endeavoured so am on the idei of Dominion Home Rule; in addition, they made, respeoti\f points which merit attention,Mrs. SHSiiMY-SKSFFIOTON said:-   &quot;If I were you I shf start an agitation throughout the length and breadth of oountry that would recall that Army of Occupation.   They British oonsoripts.   I have talked to some of them beoaul 1 believe in corrupting the Army, and I said &apos;What do yoj want in Ireland?1   *Didn&apos;t you enlist for the freedom of Belgium,&apos; and I said &quot;WouldVt you like to be at home wi your wife and children?&apos;   I can tell you how they reoeiv this.   It is a very fertile ground and these slaves of &apos;  British Militarism are ready and eager to break their oilMr. kooDONAGH complained vehemently of the attitude! &apos; of British labour to Sinn Fein; he is keenly disappoint .:.; that the Triple alliance has not supported the Irish Republic, and considers it purely mercenary:   &quot;If Engli Labour is worth its salt it oan olear the English Army of Russia ...... I believe that if they are properly ledlthat ......within a week they oould make the Englishof Occupation olear out of Ireland,   Sinoe English Labo has set Ireland aside, Sinn Fein will not oonsider an allianoe with labour.&quot;
(English)present, hut there is always the danger that if they feel they are not being supported and proteoted they may beoome disheartened,   It is not too much to say that at this moment every policeman who has been concerned in Investigating an outrage goes in the constant expectation of being shot in the Smok at night - if not in broad daylight.   Though the authors of these outrages are generally known to the police, it is almost impossible to obtain evidence sufficient to justify their arrest.   It is not so much that the people sympathise with the , murderers - though&apos; in many oases this is evident - as that they and their children may be branded as informers, or they in their turn be boyootted or killed.   In the disturbed areas, where organised attacks are made upon polioe barraoks (evidently with a view of intimidating the polioe and inducing the authorities to olose some of the barraoks) it seems clear that the proper course would be to give military protection to the barraoks and thus enable the police to oontinue their ordinary duties. &apos;The deoline of the Sinn Fein spirit is probably due to the aotion taken by the Irish Transport Union in fomenting unrest among agricultural labourers.   At the moment, there are strikes in Kildare, Heath, Galway and parts of Wicklow on the wage question.   The Farmers* Union is standing firm and the Transport Union funds will not stand the continual drain for strike^pay m&amp;ny days longer.   The Transport Union is fast becoming the &quot;One Big Union&quot; -tfbiok is the ideal of revolutionary labour.   The Irish farmer, who is at heart a Conservative and is, moreover, in very prosperous circumstances, is not likely to forget how the allies of the Sinn Fein movement have treated him.William 0*Brien of the Transport Union has been eleoted President of the Socialist Party in Ireland.   There are now 437 branches of this Union, with an estimated membership of68,417/
68,417, excluding Dublin.   The increase is most noticeable in districts where Sinn Fein is strongest, and in Ulster the Union remains comparatively weak.   There are bij&amp;nohes in cavan, but not one in Antrim and few in any of the other counties.    Though the Union is essentially an Irish concern , it is now watching the revolutionary movements in England and the Continent,   Jim Larkin, the founder, still remains in Amerioa, but the Federal authorities are enquiring into his nationality and it is believed that they, are considering the question of deporting him.. Ills influence in Ireland would still be.great, for P.T. Daly, whom he has nominated to aot for him, is,not universally trusted. , As long,as the Union oan foroe up wages its popularity will increase, and it is probably a far more dangerous menace to the future of Ireland than Sinn Fein itself.The enthusiasm in Dublin on the occasion of the peaoe Celebrationsand the absence of any attempted outrage, was surprising,   The people appear to have been:.quite oarried off their feet. :,8 . &amp;    l&amp;i mMim Si - . ?, H.
