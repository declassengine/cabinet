Secret.   Afghanistan.   Following from Grant, 31st July :-&quot; Afghan delegates were due to attend at 1.1. this morning, but AJi Ahmad at the last moment sent a letter to say that they had urgent business and could not attend to day or to-morrow. I replied&quot; that I considered negotiations should&apos; be pushed on, that our armies were facing each other in the field, and peace prospects are consequently disturbed, and that untoward incidents might, (? occur) which would break negotiations. No business could be more urgent than (? speedy) conclusion of tile work on which we were engaged. 1 trusted, therefore, that Afghan delegates would attend to-day as soon as possible as 1 had something important to say to.them. All Ahmad replied that they would come at four this afternoon, and meeting was held accordingly.&quot; As Ali Ahmad stated that ho had nothing on his side to say at present, and diet not produce his extenuating representations, 1 considered that time had come for delivery of peace, treaty in form of ultimatum. It was quite obvious that.&apos;Afghans would never agree to surrender of control of their foreign relations on lines of past treaties., nor would they submit to any territorial annexation, and Government of l.n&apos;clia:s prognostications of their attitude as indicated to the Secretary of State have proved correct throughout. I. accordingly addressed Afghans in following-sense : &quot; &apos; Wo have said enough on general topics to understand each other&apos;s attitude, and it is time to get to work of peace making. We cannot protract the negotiations . indefinitely, and it must be decided forthwith whether it is to be peace or war. Afghans will understand from my opening address that though the British Govern-ment wish to step this meaningless war they are not prepared to renew their friendship with Afghanistan until they have adequate assurances that Afghanistan&apos; on her side is contrite for what has happened and anxious for renewal of friendship, and that there is no risk of repetition of wanton acts that have brought about present war. In a word. His Majesty&apos;s Government are now prepared to conclude peace treaty on certain terms to be followed later if circumstances permit by a friendship treaty.&apos; - - , -        - &apos;  &quot;   : .&apos; Peace treaty was then read in Persian and copy handed to Afghan delegates. I then asked Ali Ahmad whether they had full powers to accept or refuse a treaty.. He replied they had powers necessary and that they refused all conditions imposed.. 1 said that 1 should nevertheless explain treaty to them article by article, and (lid so as follows : -&apos;&quot;&apos; Prelude and-Article  required no explanation. Article II. and Article III. indicated, steps which His Majesty&apos;s Government considered necessary to indicate to their displeasure at acts which had given rise this war, and to show that they could -not for the present, at any rate, treat the Amir as they had treated his predecessors. Article IV., however, kept open door to renewal of friendship hereafter and to re&apos;admission of Afghanistan to such benefits as may subsequently appear suitable in the light of her conduct during next six months, following were ways in which Mini and Afghan Government could best regain confidence of British Government arid thereby- secure old friendship : &quot;&apos; (1) British Government attach considerable importance to  fundamental&quot; principle of old treaties, namely, that Great Britain should be (two corrupt groups &apos;? support of and) agent of Afghanistan in conduct of her foreign relations.   British Government understood, from Amir&apos;s letter dated 28th May, that no change in this matter was contemplated.   Ali Ahmad had, however, made it clear that Afghans could not in any circumstances renew this arrangement.   We had no wish to&apos;force on them, any arrangement against ^ their will, but they must see for themselves that geographical position of Afghanistan made it important for us to (? see) Afghanistan should not become focus of Powers hostile to us.   Amir must understand that manner in which he conducted his foreign relations during next six months would be important test of his attitude toward us and of desirability of readmitting him to our friendship&quot;.   Should Amir later&apos; wish to malce some informal arrangement (not necessarily t&apos;o be embodied in&apos;an open treaty) accepting us as his advisers in foreign mates, lib would&apos;hot only be acting for the best interests of Afghanistan but would be going for&apos; to cqiivinbe the British Government of,his sincerity.   First way in which the1 Amir cotiltl show His sincerity was by dismissal of all hostile foreigners, especially &quot;Bolsheviks;&quot;&quot; &apos; (2) British&apos;Government regarded presence of Indian seclitionists in Afghanistan as indicating unfriendly attitude. Their dismissal would be convincing sign of Afglian, Government^ desire for friendship,.
&quot;&apos;(3) Action of Afghan. Government in regard to border , tribes would, be important criterion. All we required was friendly co-operation ; that there should be no intrigue with our tribes; that no allowances should be &apos; granted to them by the Afghan Government; that notorious outlaws should be removed to safe distance from frontier ; and that there should bo friendly co-operation between local officers of both Governments in settlement of local disputes and maintenance of peace on common borders.&apos; (4) British Agent at Kabul must no longer be treated practically as prisoner, but have freedom to.come and go and be treated as honoured guest. Ali Ahmad interjected that he agreed. Turning to Article V. of the Treaty, I pointed out that the British Government in the first place merely asked the Amir formally to accept the existing boundary between India and Afghanistan. It was possible that at some future date it might be advantageous for both parties to consider readjustments, but such questions could only be considered after.&apos; Finally, I stated thai this treaty as above explained was utmost limit to which British Government were prepared to go. There was nothing in it humiliating or derogatory to Afghanistan. Further, my instructions were to fix time limit within which the treaty must&apos;be accepted or refused. This time limit would be intimated in writing later. If treaty was accepted, hostilities would cease at once. If it was refused, Afghan delegates would return at once to Afghan territory and hostilities be resumed forthwith. Should they fail to give answer by required date, this would be interpreted (? as rejection of) treaty.&apos;&quot; Ali Ahmad then began an impromptu reply on somewhat vague and irrelevant lines, harping on the independence of Afghanistan and our desire to turn it into a Native State. We had been nearing peace for last few days, but treaty presented to-day had put it miles away.-&quot; After he had talked some time, I suggested that he should carefully consider the treaty and accompanying explanations on the subject which I was sending in writing to him, and give me his considered reply later. &apos; - -1&quot;Question of time limit was discussed,- and it was evident that Afghans would have to refer matter to Amir. They agreed informally that noon &apos;on 1,6th August would be reasonable date; but after further consideration 1 shall to-morrow finally fix the date.&quot;It was quite evident that the Afghans were greatly perturbed at delivery of this ultimatum, which has made it impossible for them to protract the negotiations&apos; as they obviously intended to do, or to get in their own demands first. From what Ali Ahmad (V said) &quot;it was clear that we had been correctly informed as to those demands. He alluded to Afridis and injustice, suggested cession of Waziristan, and referred to Afghan needs for money, Without doubt desire for money is weighing very heavily with them.,( After meeting adjourned I induced Afghan delegates to stay and have tea with us, and before many minutes there was very marked thaw in social atmosphere, Opportunity afforded for individual discussion and explanation of idea underlying treaty was utilised with obvious good effect, and we parted eventually on friendly terms. There is no doubt treaty is bitter pill to Afghans which they find it difficult to swallow. But I still have hope that better counsels may prevail, and that, when the whole fabric is fully considered and understood by them, they may go back upon their first peremptory refusal. All military preparations, however, should, of course, continue as before.&quot; .  ,Grant&apos;s allusion to Afghan demands refers to a forecast he managed to secure secretly the day before.   They were-(1) freedom of. foreign relations, (2) arrears of subsidy, -(3) new subsidy, (4) war indemnity,(5) amnesty for Afridis and Alohinands, (6) cession of Waziristan.No. 1 we have throughout anticipated, and were not unprepared fur the obviously impossible No. 5. Preposterous though they are, Nos. 2, 3, and 4 evince satisfactory money-hunger, which, if all goes well, will stand us in good stead six months hence, while No. 6 may possibly pave the way for consideration then of territorial exchange, e.g., conceivably Shawai for Dakka. More Afghano demands were doubtless to be.pitched high at outset, and were possibly meant to be boiled down in end to complete.independence, plus cash. Grant&apos;s tactics have apparently succeeded in taking the wind out of the Afghan sails.
