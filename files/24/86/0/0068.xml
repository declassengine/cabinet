MEivlORAl-inaM BY LORD MILNER.I have a good deal of private information to the effect that the d:issatisfaction in Canada * with regard to the action of the Ministry of Shipping about which, it will be observed from the attached telegrams, Sir E.Borden has repeatedly cabled to me, is assuming very serious proportions.t suggest that the requisitioning og the Bilbsier should be cancelled.IUth August, 1919.
PARAPHRASE TELEGRAM from the Governor General of canada to the Secretary of State for the Colonies-.(Received Colonial Office 10,10 p.in. 10th August 1919).9th August-   Following for you from my Prime Minister&quot; begins;   On account of policy and action of British Ministry of Shipping there is in this country unfortunate and widespread dissatisfaction to which I have called attention many times,   There are general aspects which have already been brought to the attention of Prime Minister but at present attention is centred upon ships owned in Canada but registered in United Kingdom. Following statement presented to me to-day by important Canadian representative interests is one illustration; &quot;BILBSTEft British registered and Canadian (?owned) operated (?from) Montreal arid Havre and has heen recognised by Ministry of Shipping as a LIKER.   She has been requisitioned from route on which she is now running to load full cargo of timber for Great Britain.  As she is a (?sheltered) deck vessel and could only take three fifths capacity such cargo she is not designed to carry timber, It has not been practicable Shipping Controller to re-qu is it ion whole cargo capacity Canadian LINERS,   before she was requisitioned a mixed cargo including pat tie and valued at about two and a half million dollars was assembled at Montreal for (?shipment) to France (?by) this vessel.   This cargo has been at Montreal for more than a week ready to be put on board her for France where good despatch in unloading can be obtained while in Great Britain owing to labour difficulties unloading of cargo of lumber will probably mean delay of two months.  While this Canadian ov/ned ship is being refused licence two Britishowned
freeowned.ships ALSTON and-0Ui]LCG3$ vare- &quot;oermitted to sail       be-tween Franca and Canada, under licence.    Canadian products arc not in conpetition with,those of United Kingdom in Jrench markets but are. in strong competition with United States products which are very similar to those of Canada,    Exporters from United States competing with-Canadian producers have large available shipping facilities and unless the very limited shipping facilities avail-able to Canada, can be utilised without unnecessary interference a valuable trade will be lost to Canada.    (?There is) grave dan-ger that Canadian producers will lack market and labouring men will lack w6rlt this winter while in the United States much more desirable conditions will prevail through securing of market from which Canadians are debarred by lack of facilities of transports.-tion&quot;-.    Department of Marine inform me that so far as above state ment relates to BILBot&amp;t it is correct.    After her cargo had been assembled and arranged for sudden requisitioning of this ship seems extraordinary and unjustifiable.    I respectfully suggest that requisitioning of this ship should be withdrawn.    Further I am convinced that any necessity for refusing transfer to Canadian   , registry of British registered ships ovrned in this country which existed during .the wax no longer prevail and that permission for transfer to Canadian registry of ships im M owned by Canadian interests should be given immediately.    I hope that you will cause this message to be considered by Prime minister and Cabinet with the least&apos;possible delay.    It is altogether probable that at the approaching session of Parliament a strong resolution on the whole question will be passed      ends.D3V0KSIIIR3.
TELEGRAM:   From the Governor General of Canada to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, (Received Colonial Office 6,15 acm0   30th July, 1919, )29th JulycMy Ministers have received very vigorous protest against steainer Rosecastle.   It :1s alleged that this steamer hair, been ordered from Naples to River Plate under some aira^emsnt between owners anui the  Ministry of Shippingo    There seems to be imperfect appreciation of conditions created in Canada by withholding of steamers under Charier of Canadian compazdos and an equally imperfect realisation of effect of such action upon public opinion in this country    My Ministers hope you will forward as soon as possible full explanation of circumstances connected with despatch of this ship to the River Plate from which she  cannot return until too late-to be of service in the StQ Laurence coal trade for this season. That trade is almost completely  demoralised for want of tonnage and is largely in hands of United States producers-&apos; DEVONSHIRE.
