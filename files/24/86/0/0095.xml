%This Document is the Property ofHj C t!;.jrr j Majeoty&apos;s government from Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department,13th August 1919. Priority A.Foreign Secret. Your telegram No. 1157 S., dated 9th August. Afghanistan. While sharing your appreciation of tact and skill displayed by British delegates, and while sincerely hoping that your diplomacy may be crowned &quot;with expected success, I regard modifications introduced in treaty at last moment as important. When. I accepted your plan, which I did with some misgiving, I had been led by your telegram of 10th July to believe that your draft was in the nature of an ultimatum to be accepted or refused as it stood. Apart, however, from nature of final omissions and substitutions, their adoption, without reference or sanction, paid hardly sufficient attention to responsibility of Secretary of State. Similarly, as regards terms of assurance, I think that my reply, which was sent with all possible speed, should have been awaited. These criticisms do not indeed affect value of arrangement as a whole, but the principle that important decisions of policy should not be taken without consultation with His Majesty&apos;s Government, is one which it is necessary in the interests of all parties to maintain, and to which 1 am confident that you will subscribe.2jSi5
