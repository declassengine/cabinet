&apos;ffc Jtj^cu^e^by the Secretary of State for India, j &quot;j&quot;SECREir.NmmEquipment of the Army in India with Aircraft, mechanical transport, &amp;c.I circulate the No. 606 A.following11th August 1919.statement with reference to War Cabinet MinutesE. S. M.It must be remembered that equipment of this, nature has been very largely developed during the course of the war, and that at the commencement of hostilities the British Army in Europe was bat poorly equipped in this respect. The develop-ment of scientific and mechanical weapons and material during the progress of the war has been enormous, but the demands of the British Armies in the Field have been such as to preclude the provision of up-to-date equipment from this country for the Army in India as it could not be spared, and, moreover, was:not so urgently required in a country where no formidably equipped enemy was to be faced.Aeroplanes. At the outbreak of war in 1914 the position in India was that a Central Flying School had been established, a number of machines obtained from this country, and arrangements made to develop aviation with the Army in India. The war rendered it necessary, however, that our resources should be employed where they were most urgently needed, and consequently the Flying-School was shut, the personnel, aeroplanes and equipment were despatched to Egypt, and India was left without any aircraft.In the early part of 1915 representations were made to the War Office regarding the provision of Flying Units for India, but it was not until the beginning of December of that year that a squadron was despatched to India. At the beginning of November 1916 the War Office were addressed on the subject of providing additional Flying-Units for India, as one squadron was quite inadequate in the event of serious operations on the North-West Frontier, and arrangements were made to despatch an additional flight. In September 1917 a further flight was formed in India from personnel and material sent from this country. From time to time aeroplanes were despatched to India by the War Office and Air Ministry to maintain the Flying Units in that country, but the demands of the Western theatres of operations rendered it impossible for the latest types of machines to he sent.In July 1918 the Secretary of State for India again addressed the Air Ministry on the question of the provision of additional Royal Air Force units for India and the equipping of the squadrons already there with suitable aeroplanes, hi reply, the Ministry stated that a scheme covering the strength and employment of aircraft in India was under preparation, but it was regretted that it was impossible at the time to divert any additional Air Force to India.In August 1918 the Secretary of State once more represented to the Air Ministry the importance of adequate and properly equipped Air Forces for the defence of the North-West Frontier of India. The Ministry, in reply, stated that the very large expenditure of machines during the operations in France, and the delay in output caused by labour troubles, rendered it impossible to despatch further Air Force to India, but that as soon as the exigencies of the Air situation on the European and other fronts admitted, the requirements of India would be met.In January 1919 the Secretary of State for India represented the position in India to the War Office, and in reply the Army Council promised the despatch to India of two additional squadrons of the Royal Air Force equipped with modern aeroplanes, and also of one flight of Handley Page machines. The Air Ministry detailed the two squadrons for India on 29th January, but in March it was reported that on account of shortage of personnel not more than one squadron could be provided at present (actually this squadron was to commence embarkation for India on 8th August 1919). In March the War Office stated that the Air Ministry had arranged to send out modern machines to re-equip the two squadrons already in India. (The machines were actually despatched in June, July and August 1919.)   In April 1919 these 187  60 8/19
Secretary of State for India again communicated with the War Office and urged the very early supply of aeroplanes, &amp;c, to India, in view of the unsettled state of the country. The Army Council then decided to transfer two squadrons of the Royal Air Force from France to India, and orders for their despatch were issued on 17th April. In view of the delay which was occurring in sending to India the Royal Air Force squadron which was under preparation in the United Kingdom, a third squadron was ordered to India from France on 7th May 1919. The bulk of the personnel of these three squadrons embarked from Marseilles for India in May and June, but on account of the difficulty of providing vessels capable of embarking the cased aeroplanes the equipment was not shipped until the end of July.Mechanical Transport was not actually in use with the Army in India prior to the war, but the work of rendering the chief roads on the North-West Frontier capable of taking mechanical transport was in hand, and has been and is being continued. . Many of these roads are in tribal country and difficult questions are involved, apart from the work of improving the roads, bridge building, &amp;c. There are now in India eight Mechanical Transport Companies of the Royal Army Service Corps, and 14 Indian Mechanical Transport Companies have been raised and formed, in addition to various subsidiary and ambulance units. Two Mechanical Transport Training Schools were opened at Ravval Pindi and Meerut for the training of Indian drivers and mechanics for both Indian and overseas purposes ; the former was closed at the time of the armistice and some large outstanding orders for mechanical transport were cancelled for reasons of economy. Since the outbreak of hostilities with Afghanistan the Government of India have made large demands on this country for Mechanical Transport units. The provision of four Divisional Mechanical Transport Companies and one Motor Ambulance Convoy is now in hand by the War Office, but great difficulty is being experienced by that Department in the provision of personnel. The Government of India have also tentatively demanded a further 15 Divisional Mechanical Transport Companies and four Motor Ambulance Convoys. Whilst the provision, of the vehicles from France is possible after reconditioning, the War Office state that the personnel cannot be provided at the present time. As regards shortage of personnel, it must be borne in. mind that India had no voice in determining the date or rate of demobilisation, which were fixed quite irrespective of her actual or possible requirements.Artillery.-At the outbreak of war the Field Artillery in India was armed with the same weapons as the Army at home, but the need for modern artillery for the armies in France became so acute that practically all the guns in India were sent home, and the Army in India was equipped with older pattern guns. As soon as manufacture permitted, new guns were sent out to India, and the Field Artillery there is now armed with the latest types of guns. Heavy batteries are not greatly used in Indian Frontier warfare on account of the difficulty of transport over the mountain roads, but the batteries there have been re-armed during the war with modern guns. A new pattern mountain gun and mountain howitzer (pack transport) had been approved for the Mountain Batteries in India prior to the war,.but it was not possible until the later stages of the war for the re-armament of the batteries to be carried out.Machine Guns. The organisation and use of these is the same in India as in the Army elsewhere. The Vickers gun is used in Machine Gun Companies and Squadrons, and the.Lewis gun in the Infantry Battalions. There are 16 Machine Gun Companies and Squadrons, five Motor Machine Gun Batteries and 16 Armoured Motor Batteries in India. The allotment of Lewis guns to battalions in India, has recently been increased.
