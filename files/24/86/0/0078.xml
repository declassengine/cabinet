This Document is the Property ofAdmiralty Memorandum for the War Cabinet.POSTWAR.......NAVAL,, P0LIQ.Y./,&apos;       Before the Board of Admiralty can draW up a Inite programme for1 1920/1921, there are certain ^stions which they would desire to have answered by tho Government, as thedo questions involve the consideration of the general policy of the Government, especially in regard to foreign relations.(l)    What is to be the policy of the Government as regards tho supremacy of the seas -(a) over the United States of America ? &apos; (bj over any probable combination ?We have held tho supromaoy of the seas for some 300 years, and hitherto the dispute has been as to how many and what Powers were to be regarded as our potential enemies, over whom we ought to have supremacy-There has never been any dispute as to the fact that no one Power oould be permitted to surpass us in Naval strength-As things stand now, the Power whioh caused us the greatest anxiety - Germany - has, for the time at all events, disappeared.   Prance and Italy are our Allies, and are exhausted by the war.   In the opinion of the Board of Admiralty, the only Navy for which we need have regard, and in respect&apos; of which we desire a decision of the Government, is the Navy of the United States of America.The facts in regard to the Naval strength of Japan are given in Appendix II, but it is considered that Japan maybe put aside for the present, whether as an individual opponent or as a partner in any probable combination against us.As regards tho United States, the situation is difficult.   I give in Appendix I tho figures whioh I have already circulated to the Cabinet.with my memorandum on the Estimates, but corrected up to date.   It will be seen that if the U.S. A* carry out their programme of 1916, abandoning altogether their additional now programme, we shall have a very naftsow margin in 1923-1924, and some of their ships will outclass ours in fighting power.It will be soon also that the new U*S.A. Fleet Organisation provides for 18 Dreadnought Battleships.and 11 pro-Dreadnought Battleships being kept fully manned and in instant readiness, as compared with the Admiralty proposal to keep 21 Dreadnought Battleships and Battle Cruisers fully manned and in instant readiness^It will zlso be seen that the U*S.A. Ikval personnel for 1920 is to be 171,000 men.It seems unlikely that the traditional policy of the U.S.A. should so alter that they should become an aggrossive power, but yet it is obvious that if they continue to maintain a Naval Force of this size, a very
moderate redaction in the Admiralty proposals in regard to Capital ships would place this Country in a position of manifest inferiority.-It is unnecessary for ire to remind tho Cabinet of the strength of feeling in this country and throughout tho Empire iS favour &quot;of the maintenance of our sea supremacy-The facts and figures arc of course known to everybody v/ho is interested in naval questions5 and I think it must bo recognised that the Government must now definitely decide&quot;whether thoy are prepared to maintain the supremacy which we have held for so long*(2)&quot;   Tho second question (which has a very close relation to the first) is, Are wo to deal finally with the question of the strength of our Naval forces independently of the provisions of the Covenant of tho League of Nations or not ?It will be recollected that Article 8 of tho Covenant states that the Monbors of the League recognise that the maintenance of peace requires the reduction of national armaments to the lowest point consistent with national safety.&quot;   It then provides that the Council of the League &quot;taking account of the geographical situation and1111 circumstances of each State shall formulate plans for such&apos; &quot;reduction for the consideration and action of the several&quot; &quot;Governments&quot; ? and that &quot;such plans shall be sub ject to&quot; &quot;reconsideration and revision at least every 10 years.&quot; It further provides that &quot;after those plans shall have158been adopted by the several Governments, the limits of8 &quot;armaments therein fixed shall not bo exceeded without8 &quot;the concurrence of the Council&quot;.Unless we are to throw away the principle of mutual reduction of armaments, I suggest that we should not take any serious action independently of the procedure under the Covenant, but that whatever decision be arrived at, the procedure should be to propose to all the Allied Powers a reduction under the provisions of Article 8 of the Covenant-   It might be advisable to sound the UoScA* beforehand as to whether they will take joint initial action with us in putting forward such proposals through the Council of the league. We shall then know whether the object of the UoS*A. In projecting this big Fleet (as some people think) merely to have a powerful weapon with which to obtain a general reduction of Armaments,&apos;or whether it is really their intention to force us to the alternatives of cither competing with or accepting numerical inferiority to them.(3)    There is a third question upon which we seek information.   In pre-war days it was necessary for the Naval Advisers, of the Government to decide what risks ought to be run, if it was not possible tc provide.against thorn all.   An attack by Germany in the North Sea was, as we now know, rigitly re girded as tho risk which overshadowed, all others; and therefore cur Navy was built, for this particular work. - and we largely abandoned tho policy which had previously been pursued of &quot;showing the flag&quot; in fseign and other waters.   The information whioh reaches the Board of Admiralty from many quarters convinoos us that the time has come when it is necessary that the White Ensign should be seen in all these places.   This does not necessarily mean a largo number of expensive shipsjiinii.il mill ii h&quot;     1 t
but it doos mean a sufficient number of light cruisers to enable us to show the flag in these waters.   Only recently wo havo had evidence of tho effect produced by the appearance of our ships in South American wators; and tho Board of Admiralty ask the Cabinet to say definitely whether they are in future to pursue the policy known as 3showing the flag1.   This, again, is a subject upon which very strong feeling exxsts in this country and in the Emjdre.   There is every indication that the Up So A- and Japan aro both well aware of the advantages which flow from tho presence of their ships in foreign waters, and that they are doing all that they can to push their trade and their general interests, by sending their ships to stations whero prior to 1904 wo had-thew rawaopo ly.(4)    A further question is:   What should be the period of time during which we may rookon on immunity from war with a groat Power or comb ination of snail Powers giving an equivalent enemy force, and therefore a reduction in our naval preponderanceoIt has been suggested that it should be for a period of either five or ten years.   On the one hand, we &quot;know accurately what the position to the UoS. Navy and the Japanese Navy will be at the end of five years, whereas, unless the League of Nations oporates, it is impossible to say what they will be at the end of ten. Gntthe other,hand, if we could fix upon the longer period, It would undoubtedly enable us to make more effective reductions at pre sent.. The view of the Admiralty is, however, that as our actv.al information only covers tho shorter period, tho question whether the linger period can safely be adopted must depend upon whether the Covenant of the League of Nations, which names 10 sears as tho extreme period at which revisions of Naval and Military strength shall take place, makes an auspicious beginning.In conclusion, I desire briefly to call the attention of my colleagues to the faot that, while the demands for reductions and economics are mado with growing iasistcmce, the demands upon the Navy show no signs of decrease - quite the contrary..   We have been called upon reoently to keep a large force in Russian waters   jbo provide a force for Plensburg in connection with, tho Sohleswig plebiscite; we have had to send mon to Yorkshire; to have others in reserve for troubles elsewhere; ships to Liverpool; and we have constant demands for the presence of ships by some of our Crown Colonies.   If we have to admit that we cannot meet these and other calls, will not the effect upon the Empiro and, indeed, the world, be disastrous?.(signed) W. H. LOHJ.12.8.19.

Fleet Organisation is to consist of two main Fleets of practically equal strength - the Atlantic and the Pacific - with a small Asiatic Fleet and still,smaller Auxiliary Squadrons in various localities-   The Atlantic and Pacific Fleets are each to consist of 4 divisions of Battle-ship, 2 divisions of Cruisers, 10 divisions of Destroyers, 3 divisions of Submarines, and 2 divisiions of Minelayers, together with repair ships and other Auxiliaries.Tho U-S*A., therefore, intend to keep in full commissionBattleships (Dreadnought)......*        16.-do-       (Pre-Dreadnought) ......        11.

Japan will continue to build at her full capacity, and money has already been voted to increase this capacity.
