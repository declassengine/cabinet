7f0Jis.ThJ3 D&apos;-/.:..;n-cnt -ji tho. Prbp-^ty cfinF?&apos;o??i Viceroy, with August 1910. .(Received-5th, 1,.30 a.rri.)   - &apos;        ,Clear the Hue..1123 S. Secret. Afghanistan. Grant&apos;s telegraphic report on this morning&apos;s meeting has not yet reached us, but telephonic report makes it clear that control of foreign relations is now crux of situation. Afghan delegates are sore at not being offered treaty of friendship and at the actual terms of the treaty of peace. On the question of Afghanistan^ absolute independence, however, they are to all appearances adamant. It has been explained to them that freedom of foreign relations is not a matter for inclusion or discussion in relation to treaty of peace at all. They insist, however, that they cannot go empty handed to Kabul for signature of chapter one unless they are given clear indication of our attitude in chapter two in regard to this point of paramount importance. They ask insistently therefore, for separate letter from Grant giving them desired assurance in writing.   Grant proposes following : -&quot;After compliments. You asked me this morning for some further assurance that peace treaty which British Government now offer contains nothing that interferes with complete liberty of Afghanistan either in internal or external matters. My friends, if you will read treaty carefully you will see there is no suggestion of such interference. You have told me Afghan Government are unwilling to renew arrangement whereby Tate Amir agreed to follow unreservedly advice of British Government in regard to his external relations. I have not, therefore, pressed this matter and no mention of it is made in treaty, which therefore leaves Afghanistan entirely free in. this respect. At the same time I have impressed you that British Government will regard Amir&apos;s conduct of his foreign relations as an important test of friendliness of his feelings towards them and will be ready at any time he may wish to assist him. with advice in these matters.&quot;We ask for your approval to this formula. We ourselves are convinced that without some such assurance rupture of negotiations is almost inevitable and that -Afghanistan would only consent to our formal control of her foreign relations after crushing defeat in which case she would make it a dead letter as soon as she dared. On the other hand we feel that if we now surrender our shadow we may secure hereafter the substance of real control such as we have never been able to exercise satisfactorily in the past. Ali Ahmad confidentially hinted to Grant after the meeting that provided they could waive a document of liberty of this kind as proof of something positive attained to counterbalance our treaty of demands all would probably go well. He himself felt sure that Amir&apos;s conduct of foreign relations ^would give us no cause for complaint and anticipated that if he himself remained in office there would be no difficulty in (? getting; Amir to consult us informally whenever occasion arose.Any delay might very seriously prejudice the negotiations and we earnestly trust it may be possible for you to send us your instructions by to-morrow evening.
