B E P 0 E T.The Select Committee appointed to investigate the congestion in the existing means oi TRANSPORT in the METROPOLITAN AREA, together with the question of fares, have agreed to the following Report : Your Committee, appointed on May 29th, 1919, began their sittings on June 2nd, met on 22 days, and took the oral evidence of 36 witnesses; they invited and examined memoranda from many authorities and organisations interested in the problem; they also discussed and considered statements forwarded by members of the public.THE OUTSTANDING FACT.1. Before setting out their conclusions, your Committee desire at the outset to put on record the one outstanding fact which, by the open admission or tacit agreement of every witness who has come before them, discloses the full and adequate reason for the demoralisation of traffic in Greater London. It is the absence of a Supreme Traffic Authority for Greater London, possessing executive powers to control, co-ordinate and initiate, and to safeguard and further public interests.Owing to the absence of such an authority there is not a single important recommendation made in the past for the improvement of London Traffic, for the avoidance of congestion, or for the benefit of the public and innumerable Commissions and Committees have devoted much time and thought to this subject which has had the. slightest chance of being carried into effect.Your Committee are well aware that the suggestions they now put forward will not share any better fate unless Centralised Control is at once brought into existence. - The immediate creation by Parliament of a London Traffic Authority can alone remedy the present intolerable conditions.Sole Condition of Refokm.2. Every phase of the transport system of London has been scrutinised through the witnesses whom your Committee have examined; they have also had laid before them many important memoranda by leading expertst and, in response to a request, to the local authorities and to the public, they havereceived and considered much useful information which has helped to explain the outstanding aspects of the present state of the traffic facilities of Greater London.The witnesses whom your Committee have examined have been less numerous than these who have appeared before previous Commissions and Committees which, hitherto, have applied their time aud attention to the consideration of this problem futile consideration as events have so far proved but all available evidence of the past has been laid before your Committee, and they haye devoted close attention to a study of the comparative arguments and the definite conclusions of their predecessors.In our opinion an immediate solution of the problem is imperative, since it has reached the dimensions of a public scandal. The members of your Committee have formed clearly defined views upon remedial measures, but, as matters stand, not one need be carried out, They may counsel complete co-ordination of traffic, avoidance of senseless and costly competition, regulation of routes, revision of the existing system of fixing fares, but they are powerless to effect a single reform, failing a Supreme Authority with statutory poAver to enforce their recommendations.Your Committee may state that various vehicles now being used on the tube railways and train-way routes and by the omnibus companies are capable of great improvement; they may advise that improved types should be introduced at the earliest moment, but not one of the several transport organisations need pay any heed to these recommendations, if there is no Supreme Authority capable of insisting on effect being given to them.3. No Government Department to-day possesses powers of direction and control which arein the least degree effective,&apos; or intended to be effective, in the regulation of London traffic. In earlier times this may have been more explicable, but it was none the less disastrous. It is responsible for our faulty street alignment, for the stereotyping of ill-suited routes of general locomotion, and for the failure to visualise the increasing possibilities of mechanical transport.The Metropolitan Police have been given powers to regulate the traffic, but they often act under moral rather than legal authority, They consider &quot; these powers generally are fairly ample, flexible and sufficient,&quot; though at the same time admitting, in the hands of another authority, more extensive powers might re-act to the public benefit. These undefined powers the police themselves do not desire to possess, since they might, in their opinion, possibly bring them into conflict with existing interests, or with certain sections of the public, and so affect the goodwill under which the police mainly carry out their general duties.The Board of Trade interprets its main duty as &quot;securing the safety of the public in connection with transport undertakings,&quot; a vague phrase which, unless an accident occurs, merely covers the initial inspection of railways, tramway lines, and rolling-stock, but takes no account of the methods under which use is made of them by the operating companies so long as certain standardised conditions of running imposed by Parliament are observed. The London Traffic Branch of the Board of Trade closed on June 30th, 1916.
The Home Office has tho power of fixing taxi-cab fares, but its attitude on this point is puzzling and according to the evidence of an ex-member of your House has been confused and contradictory, though it is only fair to say that the Home Secretary of the period referred to strongly resents this criticism as unfounded. Also, through the police, the Home Office is the supreme authority for licensing omnibuses and other public vehicles.The Local Government Board is tho sanctioning authority for expenditure on street improve-ments by local authorities outside the administrative County of London, and is the confimrng authority for many bye-laws made by local authorities, and in ihis Avay exercises, so far as traffic is concerned, some sort of supervision without having the power ot initiation, except in regard to town planning.  These powers will ultimately be transferred to the Ministry of Health,The London County Council possesses the right to operate tramways, but cannot develop its system without express Parliamentary sanction, and it finds that while there is no Traffic Authority to co-ordinate or direct, and few authorities willing to put forth individual energy in the provision of public transport, there are many always ready to take up a position which might be helpful but which is usually the reverse: First, the City, with its right of veto: then the London and Greater London Boroughs, who have the same rights conferred on them by Parliamentary Standing Order 22* relating to private business of the House of Commons, while the outer urban bodies have also to be considered. Of these local authorities, it is estimated, according to the radius taken, there are some 172 to 204. They do not originate, but they can veto or exact specific conditions&quot; from those who provide transport. No one denies their knowledge of local conditions, but invariably their action is essentially local and pays no regard to the requirements of Greater London as a whole.Nor does the. dead-weight of obstruction cease here. There are also the frontagers, who have their rights, and seem able to enforce them; and in congested streets, owners of vested interests, are remarkably vocal whenever reform is mooted. Even residents in particular thoroughfares are able collectively to exercise a detrimental influence on traffic proposals.. The Inevitable Kksult.4. Under these circumstances what can be expected? On the one hand, we find official complacency--almost apathy. Every authority laments the existing chaos, utters pious wishes for improvement, expresses satisfaction with its own aims, records contentedly its amicable relations with everyone else . . . and does nothing On the other hand, there is the obstruction of the veto by local authorities, well informed but self-interested, watchful to check action rather than eager to display sympathetic trea-tment of a traffic system planned on broad and comprehensive lines.Between this apathy and obstruction, various means of transport carry on, compete to live, struggle for profit, and, while doing so, often express concern for the common weal, which varies as a rule in inverse ratio to financial results. Not a solitary witness has suggested that the present state of affairs is desirable, or that it does not imperatively demand an immediate and drastic remedy.   To the discovery of this remedy your Committee have devoted their efforts.5. Your Committee therefore put in the forefront of their report as the paramount recommendation which governs the entire utility of their work, the immediate creation of a Supreme Greater London Traffic Authority. They recommend its establishment, not as a step which may be taken when opportunity offers, but as a vital measure of the most immediate necessity.6. Witnesses have expressed- the view that the immediate congestion during what are- termed the &quot; peak-load&quot; hours, causing much suffering, discomfort and positive hardship to the public, is due to lack of adequate transport facilities arising out of war conditions. The Committee do not accept this in its entirety. Every transport authority asserts there is wasteful and overlapping competition on the part of its rivals, and every authority is more concerned in maintaining its present financial position and safeguarding its future prospects than in taking, bjr agreement, measures which would go very far to remedy the present uncfesirable condition of affairs. Indeed, apart from the statements of witnesses, tnis was admitted in a series of private negotiations between the London County Council and. the General Omnibus and Associated Companies, held in 1915-16, when failure to reach an understanding on the co-ordination of transport services in the public interests was due solely to an inability to agree over the creation and division of &quot; the fare pool,&quot; and on the future preferential position of both parties as against the intervention of other transit undertakings.* Standing Order 22 :-In cases of Bills to authorise the laying down of a Tramway, the promoters shall obtain the consent of the local authority of the district or districts through which it is proposed to construct such Tramway, and where in any district there is a road authority distinct from the local authority, the consent of such road authority shall also be necessary in any case where power is sought to break up any road, subject to the jurisdiction of such road authority. For the purpose of this Order, in -England and Scotland, the local and road authorities shall be the local and road authorities for the purposes of &quot; The Tramways Act, 1870,&quot; except that in the case of a rural district in England the rural district council shall be deemed to be the local authority, and in Ireland the local and road authorities shall be the district councils and the county councils respectively. Provided that where it is proposed to lay down a continuous line of Tramway in two or more districts, and any local or road authority having jurisdiction in any such districts does not consent thereto, the consents of the local and road authority, or the local and road authorities having jurisdiction over Two-thirds of the length of such proposed line of Tramway, shall be deemed to be sufficient.0.187. B
At the same time, every witness has admitted that the outlook for the travel, facilities of the people of London, as regards congestion and fares, is very disquieting, both in the immediate future and in the years to come. Sufficient evidence has also been laid before your Committee to show that if the community intend to establish an efficient, control of transport arrangements so vitally affecting their daily life, they have no time to spare.Prompt action in your Committees opinion can alone avert much public inconvenience and suffering, and even mortality this winter. In wet, cold and inclement weather uncovered outside seats are only suitable for strong people, and long waits at street corners for a vacant place in over-crowded conveyances are a frequent cause of illness. Moreover it must be borne in mind that nowadays cheap and rapid transport is regarded in every household as an essential, irrespective of means and class, and when these facilities fail, as they have done partially this summer, you have a suitable forcing-ground for all kinds of discontent and agitation.&apos;There are moreover vast essential improvements which only an efficient and enterprising Traffic Authority can carry out over a period of years. Had the recommendations of the Royal Commission of 1905 been accepted London would not at this time be so helplessly exposed to the shortcomings and defects of which there is universal complaint. But even now enough can be done if there be no delay to guarantee the community against immediate ills, which must otherwise continue to increase. Your Committee therefore assume, in all the advice tendered hereafter in regard to remedies for congestion of traffic, that a Supreme Traffic Authority will be immediately called into existence.DEFINITION OF SUPREME TRAFFIC AUTHORITY.7. The public will expect a clear definition of this Authority. In your Committees view, the time has passed when such an Authority can be merely consultative or advisory, as was recom-mended by the Royal Commission of 1905. Few of the local bodies agree in respect to positive recommendations. The County Council suggests that it should be elective and take over the Traffic Department of the Council, and also deal &quot; with other things,&quot; an instance of the mental confusion which is characteristic of so many points of view in this controversy. The Underground Group of Companies otherwise known as the &quot;Combine,&quot; recommend as practically inevitable &quot;a Central Control&quot; to deal with all transport, including main line railways, but object to this &quot;Central Control&quot; being invested with powers to fix fares, or to give orders in detail, unless it assumes financial responsibility. The outer County Councils favour a Board of Control, but with dominant municipal influence based on some form of popular representation. The Board of Trade is not hostile to a unifying governing authority of some kind, but, with the Railway Companies, it appears to have lost active interest in the question since the projected establishment of the Ministry of Ways and Communications.&quot;&quot;&apos;There appears to be no objection by the other authorities concerned to the principle of a Supreme Traffic Authority, though in the case of the secondary Municipal Bodies it were too optimistic to assume that they would not oppose some of the powers with which it is absolutely vital such an Authority should be invested. This specially applies to the retention of the right of local veto.So far as the Local Borough Councils are concerned, this right of veto is conferred by Stand-ing Order 22 ot Parliament and could therefore be withdrawn without difficulty. The position is different with regard to the City of London, which is in itself a Local Authority under the Tramways Act.The Police view, as stated above, is that the creation of the new suggested authority would help them.There can be no question as to the public point of view. London is faced not merely with the certainty of the present traffic arrangements becoming worse and worse, but with future schemes on the part of private interests which may one day form an extreme menace to its comfort, convenience and prosperity. Of course, this will not be admitted by the interests concerned, but there are too few traffic organisations in existence, or privately feasible, in London to hold out hope of ultimate escape, unless remedial measures are introduced well in advance and as soon as possible. A traffic monopoly, like other kindred commercial activities, will veil its gradual pro-progression with a great show of benevolent intentions, but the final evil will be none the lesscertainIts Composition.8. It is therefore incumbent on your Committee to give in precise terms (omitting adminis-trative detail)the composition, the powers and the functions of a Supreme Traffic Authority, such as they conceive them.  It is considered that, owing to the multiplicity of public and other bodies* The Ministry of Ways and Communications will have jurisdiction over tramways belonging to companies of private persons, but no jurisdiction over tramways belonging to local authorities. As regards omnibuses, where omnibus routes have been authorised by special Act of Parliament, in the bands of local authorities, the Ministry will have no jurisdiction, but so far as a local authority or a company applies to the Ministry for sanction to run omnibuses over a new route not authorised by statute, but under the provisions of Section 20 of the Local Govern-ment Emergency Provisions Act, 1916, the Ministry will have jurisdiction under Clause 3, Sub-section 4, of the Ministry of Ways and Communications Bill.  The position is therefore exceedingly mixed.
involved, which might claim representation on an elected Board, the principle of direct repre-sentation is inapplicable. They therefore recommend the establishment of a Greater London Traffic Authority on the following lines :-1. Small in numbers for efficiency&apos;s sake: Five members as a maximum, to be appointed by the Government from nominations submitted by : The Home Office one; Ministry 01 Ways and Communications one; London County Council-one; Local Authorities outside the Administrative County of London-one; with an independent Chairman to be appointed by the Government.2. The Chairman should regularly report the proceedings of the Authority to the Secretary of State for Home Affairs, who shall answer for, and be responsible for keeping the House of Commons informed as to the work of the Traffic Authority.3. The Authority, so far as Greater London is concerned, should have transferred to it the powers at present exercised by any Ministry or Department in so far as these powers are necessary to efficient administration by the Authority.4. The Authority should exercise its powers over the Metropolitan Police Area.5. The Authority should in particular deal with the following :-i. Prepare and keep up to date a general plan to which all London transit facilities should conform, and bring before the authorities concerned the necessary steps to be taken to secure improvements.ii. Report to Parliament on the compliance with such plan of every new scheme promoted.iii. Direct the co-ordination of the routes and services of existing means of transport, e.g,y tubes, suburban railway services, tramways, and omnibuses. -iv. Administer the Hackney Carriage Acts.v. Approve all designs for any vehicles used for the transport of passengers, and any alterations thereto, and enforce regulations for the public comfort and convenience.vi. Initiate legislation for traffic improvement.vii. Make bye-laws for the regulation of all traffic.viii. Initiate and enforce remedial action in respect of all obstructions to street locomotion.  Examples: (a) Breaking up of streets;(6) Selection of routes for all vehicles;(c) Control of speed of differing vehicles;(d) All other obstructions to street traffic.-  (e) The provision of subways at congested points if deemed necessary.To sanction : (a) Stopping places for tramcars, omnibuses, cab ranks, etc.(b) Omnibus and tramway queues;(c) Entrances, exits, and platform accommodation on tube railways;(d) All other abuses arising out of street traffic.Your Committee Avish to point out that apart from purely administrative expenditure, which by reason of the national and imperial character ot London ought, in their opinion, to be borne by the State, no funds will be required, since in its initial stages the Traffic Authority will not possess the power either of carrying out broad schemes of improvement itself or imposing them oh others, except through the operation of Parliament. Each member ot the Board ought to be paid for whole-time service.-EVILS OF CONGESTION.9. Under the terms of reference your Committee were instructed to investigate the existing congestion of Metropolitan transport as well as the increases of. fares, with a view to making recommendations for remedial and immediate action in any directions in which this might be found possible.Congestion has existed for some time in London traffic, but the war intensified it as regards passenger transport, though it increased almost&apos;imperceptibly, and was regarded with a measure of toleration, which is a great tribute to the patriotism of Londoners, and also is evidence of their patience and long suffering. With the declaration of the Armistice, and the prospect of a return * to normal conditions, people were naturally disposed to enquire whether the scandal of over-crowding was unavoidable or should be perpetuated for a single clay longer than necessary.It is no exaggeration-having regard to the evidence placed before us-to describe the existing congestion as a scandal. Twice a day for a period of about two hours passengers are forced to subject themselves not merely to physical discomfort, but too often to actual physical suffering, in their endeavours in the morning to reach their places of
business/and in the evening to return to their homes. The police recognised that the normal regulations could not be maintained, in view of the demand tor passenger transport which, attained such vast proportions in 1917,1918, and in the early part of 1919. They, therefore, were obliged to make many concessions; to permit overcrowding; to waive the strict control they had hitherto exercised in licensing vehicles; to interpret traffic regulations in face of existing conditions with the maximum of official good will.No doubt their attitude, even if delayed, was helpful, but it had the consequence that private purveyors of passenger transport, which is almost a monopoly, decided that if the police felt.com-pelled to depart from their customary policy they themselves Avould be safe in developing these concessions upon unrestricted lines. They accordingly did so. To a certain extent they may have been compelled to do so, but from the public standpoint the results were disastrous. Trains were crowded not merely to excess, but almost to danger point. The crush in the &quot;peak hours&quot; not only overloaded public conveyances, but subjected travellers, particularly the old, the feeble and women, to an amount of suffering, the effects of which often unfitted them temporarily for their ordinary duties. These transport agencies were aware of the evils, but the evils meant better receipts. They also meant dangerous crushes in stations, lifts and trains. There were also wearisome waits in streets in inclement weather for standing-room in vehicles that arrived already j packed to excess.It is somewhat sardonic that the only effective protest against unrestricted overcrowding seems to have come from the employees, Avho complained that they could not properly collect the fares.10. It is not surprising that in course of time public discontent took a decided form, but it would not probably have done so at such an early date had not the transport agencies raised their fares in some cases on an unfair basis. To this development of the situation the inception of your Committee can be attributed. Their first object was therefore to ascertain the causes of the congestion, and to analyse the possibilities of modification and removal.Causes of Congestion.11. The unanimity with respect to many of these causes is remarkable. With the rest there was bound to be some difference of opinion, since they reflect upon the agencies Avhose policy made them possible. Thus every witness has been ready to attribute the congestion in some way or other to the Avar. Two chief causes were alleged, one being the a withdrawal of rolling stock for the purposes of the Government, and the impossibility of replacing it, and the other the vast increase in the travelling requirements of the public, due in the main to the calls made on all sections of the community for every form of war service.Moreover, as the population increases the amount of travelling per person increases in a greater proportion ; secondly, as the wealth of any community increases so does the extent to Avhicli the members of the community travel increase also, and in a very much greater proportion: while thirdly, as the standard of life increases, &quot;so also in a much greater proportion do members of the community travel.  *There are many minor causes, one being the groAvth of the amusement habit, in Avhich the popularity of the cinema has played a great part. Another is, or was, the lack of adequate domestic help, which compelled people to seek their meals outside their own homes.ToAvards the end of the Avar, neAv causes began to present themselves which may play an increasingly prominent part in rendering the congestion worse. The legalisation of the eight hours&apos; day which may be carried into effect before the Avinter, and Avhich has already been introduced into many trades by agreement, Avill have the effect of making the hours of labour of those engaged in purely industrial pursuits coincide Avith the hours of those employed in other grades of commercial life.The congestion, which is at its worst in the morning between seven and nine-thirty, and in the evening between five and seven, will thereby be rendered more serious unless proper precautions to provide remedies are taken well in advance,12, The solution of the housing problem largely depends upon the provision of adequate traffic facilities. In an interesting memorandum submitted to your Committee by the Garden Cities and ToAvn Planning Association, it is suggested that if the houses to be constructed in the Metropolitan Area Avithin the next five years are built as dormitories for the Avorkers in Central London, the congestion will be only intensified, and the remedy is put forward of planning residential suburbs as compact industrial towns and the establishment of new industrial towns in the form of garden cities Avith populations of from 30,000 to 50,000 throughout the Home Counties. The recom-mendation is valuable, but it presupposes the joint establishment both of industries and of residences, since the latter without the former will not respond, in the opinion of your Committee, to the actual public requirements.  Your Committee desire to lay stress on this point.Your Committee are of opinion that ordinary economic forces must inevitably tend to compel people to reside further and further aAvay from the centre of London. An eight hours&apos; day Avill give them longer time for leisure and will stimulate the growth of the allotment and garden movements. Higher rates in the centre of London will operate to the same end. Even Summer Time is not Avithout its influence. Any rise&apos; in the standard of living must in respect of the demand for modern houses have a centrifugal effect. Such a minor cause as the diminution of night Avork in various industries cannot be overlooked. And finally the re-establishment of family life interrupted by the Avar Avill mean migration from rooms provisionally occupied in the inner suburbs to houses on self-contained lines in the outer area.
EXISTING MEANS OF TRANSPORT.13, To appreciate the situation to the full it is necessary to understand the various means of transport in London. Omitting taxi-cabs, which are dealt with in a separate paragraph, the population of Greater London, which in 1914 was 7,465,000-and to-day is very greatly increasing  is mainly dependent upon four distinct types of facilities :-Tramways : Operated by the London County Council and Urban authorities or municipally built, but leased as in the case of the London Electric Tramways, which holds from the Middlesex County Council.Underground Railways :-All, save the Metropolitan and the Waterloo and City*and the Great Northern and City are in the hands of the Underground Electric Railways Company, Limited, known as the &quot;Combine.&quot; Strictly speaking these lines are only part of the &quot; Combine,&quot; which includes the Metropolitan District Railway Company, London Electric Railway Company (Baker Street-Water loo Line, Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway, and Charing Cross-Hampstead Railway), City and South London Railway, Central London Railway, London General Omnibus Company, and London and Suburban Traction Company, (Metropolitan Electric Tramways Company, London United Tramways Company, and South Metropolitan Electric Tramways Company).In other words, the Combine owns and operates all the tramways in the Administrative County of London except those municipally owned. In addition, it has a close working arrangement with Messrs. Tillings and the National Steam &apos;Bus Company.The total capital of all the Combine Companies is  43,483,029, of which  18,643,420 is ordinary stock, and the balance other issues.Omnibuses :-All in the administrative county of London owned by the &quot; Combine,&quot; except Messrs. Tillings and the National Steam Bus Company, though the alliance with them is very close &apos; and intimate, on a system of pooled receipts (in the former case) and of guaranteed receipts (in the latter).Main Line Railways :-With London Termini, but working a large suburban traffic.Thus, the local passenger traffic for London in 1918 is estimated as follows : Local Railways (exclusive of suburban traffic on main lines)     699,000,000f Tramways (including outer-urban and &quot; Combine &quot;)  -     -     992,000,000 Omnibuses (including Tillings and National Steam &apos;Bus Co.)     682,000,000Total -     -   2,373,000,000or an increase of over 1,000,000,000 in ten years from 1,363,815,165. In 1913, the last complete pre-Avar year, the total was 2,007,348,055.Generally speaking, the approximate number of journeys per head per year of the civil population in Greater London in 1918 was 101*2 (local railway lines only), 149-5 (tramways), and 102*8 omnibuses,The London County Council operates 150 tramway miles out of 353 in the Metropolitan area; it owns 1,662 electric cars and 158 trailer cars. It carries over two million passengers daily and the estimated cost of running a tramcar mile, excluding capital cost and renewal, is 15&apos;99d. (1919-20). This entails an estimated deficit of  159,000, assuming that the whole of the present charges on the undertaking, including the allocation of the sinking fund, are met in accordance with the existing procedure. There are only 1,210 cars and 112 trailers in average use owing to repairs, and the estimated revenue per car mile in 1919-20 is 20*26d. Other tramways are run with less stock and there is less congestion, since they are extra-urban. In 1918 the three &quot;Combine&quot; tramways carried 198,334,499 passengers. They have been working at a loss, the preference and ordinary dividends having been passed last year.The Underground Railway group of Companies, which possesses&apos; altogether 1,390 cars of all sorts, and works 1,165, carried approximately in 1918, 380 million passengers. For dividend purposes the receipts of these different railways are &quot; pooled &quot; with those of the omnibuses; the average rate of dividend paid is 2*93 per cent, on the aggregate share capital.As regards the omnibuses, the number in use (May) was 2,044; before the war it was 2,906. About 100 emergency lorry-&apos;buses were in service at the end of June, and more were being added0.187.* Owned and operated by the London and South-Western Railway, t The London County Council gives this total as nearly 672,000,000.
from week to week. The actual &apos;bus mileage run last year by 1,796 &apos;buses was 73,152,709, while the passengers carried by the &quot;Combine&quot; amounted to 652,562,327. In 1913 the takings per mile run were 8&apos;57d.; in 1915 they were 10*78d.;&apos;in 1918 they Avere 15;32d. On the other hand, the working cost in 1913 traffic expenses, including labour, maintenance, repairs and roads, petrol, tyres and &quot;other expenses,&quot; including administration and depreciation Avas 7 19d. per car mile run; in 1915, 8&quot;58d. and in 1918,14&apos;05d.Owing to Government control reliable statistics regarding suburban railway traffic are not available, but according to all the evidence laid before us the traffic is rapidly increasing. About 2,277 suburban trains arrived at the various London termini of the main lines on a given day in June of this year. Suburban trains comprise all&apos; those starting within the 20 miles limit or expresses taking up passengers at three or more stations within this limit. During the War 61 suburban railway stations were closed by the Railway Executive, of which 25 have been or will be re-opened. It is intended to close permanently 14, and no decision has yet been taken as to the re-opening of 22, The. Metropolitan Railway estimates it will this year carry 182,000,000 passengers. Fares have only on the average, according to the evidence tendered, been increased by 12i per cent., but no dividend on the ordinary stock, and only on a part of the preference dividend could have been paid without the Government guarantee.FUNCTIONS  OF TRANSPORT.14. On this point, the evidence taken by your Committee has been characterised by a . regrettable absence on the part of all Government Departments or Local Authorities or Transport Agencies of a broad view of public requirements, of a realisation that the Greater London Traffic Problem is one indivisible whole, of a real conception of the properly co-operating roles ot varying kinds of transport in the life of the community.Voluminous statistics have been placed before your Committee, not to demonstrate the effect of co-ordinated effort towards a common end, but to establish the value of a particular means of transport or its claim to preferential treatment. The testimony on this latter point has been frank, but it has none the less shown great conflict of opinion as to the relative and absolute function of railways, tubes, tramways and omnibuses. Even had clear and accurate views on the subject been held, they could not have been realised, so great are the restrictions confronting every means of transport.With the railways there is a disposition primarily to regard themselves as catering for long distance suburban traffic. The &quot;Combine&quot; omnibus.es extensively compete for this traffic&apos;despite the fact that officially they exist to deal with &quot; short distance travelling.&quot;The question of the most useful means of transport, in dealing with &quot;peak-hour&quot; traffic, shows an extraordinary difference of opinion. Witnesses put forward diametrically conflicting views, some preferring railways and others tramways. The &quot;Combine,&quot; while not overlooking the work of the tubes, the congestion on which would &quot;be ruei by the new programme of construction,&quot; thinks it can &quot;with the motor-&apos;buses certainly cope with the whole question of congestion in London without any difficulty, assuming unlimited construction and employment of the new 46-seat capacity vehicle.&quot;In the face of so much conflicting evidence on the methods of operation a Supreme Traffic Authority is essential to enforce a working scheme between all the services, in which the only consideration will be the maximum of convenience and comfort to the public, consistent with the reasonable financial requirements of each operating concern. *Such an authorised working scheme would eliminate competition and ignore the claims of an operating organisation to preferential treatment. . There is no ground whatever for the acceptance of the &quot; Combine&quot; view that their surface activities merit, at least so far as omnibuses are concerned, any special franchise, and certainly not a monopoly, and their antagonism to L.C.C. (and presumably any other) development, either in respect of tramway extension or motor-&apos;bus running, would not be entertained by any Executive Authority which aimed at making London transport effective and efficient, and which might fitly issue an authorisation.to the County Council to run omnibuses should it.wish to do so. It is very necessary, in the opinion of your Committee, to lay stress on this point, because all the Combine &quot;evidence tended to show that its operations are aimed at &quot;pegging out claims &quot; which one day may be put forward as vested rights.STREET TRAFFIC NEEDS.15. Having dealt in paragraph 8 of this Report with the composition and duties of the suggested Supreme Traffic Authority, your Committee proceed to consider the whole question of vehicular traffic, and in so doing would desire to quote an interesting table supplied to them by the London Traffic Board of the Board of Trade, in which, to arrive at some uniform basis of comparison, a &quot; traffic unit&quot; is established in terms of which every vehicle might be described on a co-efficient basis, having regard to the size, speed and flexibility, and not merely (in the case of passengers) its carrying capacity. The taxicab has been selected as the unit, and the scale based on it is appended.

This is not contended even by the police, whose caution would at times appear to be characterised by unfounded nervousness, proof of which is, for instance, afforded by their unjustified apprehension regarding the use of trailers and by the reduction in the number of street casualties, despite the admitted tendency of many motor vehicles illegally to exceed the maximum speed limit.This is demonstrated by the following Table: Return of persons killed or injured by accidents known to the Police to have occurred in the streets during the years 1904 to 1918.Year.

The number of non-fatal accidents was 1,368.Your Committee are aware of the reduction in the number of vehicles during the Avar, but in their opinion this&apos;Avas very largely counter-balanced by the bad lighting conditions and by the general use of Government vehicles of all sorts on an exceptionally large scale.16. The police, except in the City, as already stated, do not possess adequate poAvers to regulate traffic. It is therefore clear that all vehicular traffic-goods as much as passenger would greatly benefit by the existence of a Supreme Traffic Authority Avith adequate poAvers of regulation and control. No others are of use. Such poAvers could be exercised in many helpful directions. Thus, the evidence has sIioavu the need for:- -(1) Regulation of routes, both of passenger and goods traffic, Avhich would entail the use of side streets whenever possible for slow-moving vehicles.(2) Restriction of up and doAvn traffic in narroAv streets, as in the City, by the selection of separate routes.(3) Better control ot all cross traffic, and of both sIoav and fast traffic.(4) Systematisation of road repair, much of Avhich, especially in the main streets, should be carried out at night, or at such times as would best meet traffic conditions.(5) Regulations for the breaking-up of the streets for the laying of gas and water mains, sewers, electric light cables, telegraph and telephone wires, etc.(6) Arrangement for stopping places for omnibuses, as Avell as for trams. 0.187.

(7) Formation of queues at all heavy traffic points.(8) Restriction of competitive services along the same routes.(9) Regulation of all street obstructions, permanent, periodical (see 4) and moveable.(10) An increase of the speed limit for trams as well as omnibuses,(11) The linking-up, so far as practicable, of &quot;tramway dead-ends e.g., Farringdon Street and Blackfriars, Vauxhall Bridge Road and Harrow Road.*(12) The granting of powers to any municipal authority to own and operate omnibuses in their area.LARGER ISSUES OF LONDON TRAFFIC.17. The larger issues of London transport cannot be ignored, and must be faced and solved by those who will assume supreme&apos; control. To a considerable extent they involve expert engineering problems. Your Committee are thus not called on to express any opinion as to the relative values of means of transport and they are many and various which have been urged with equal persistency and equal authority, such as the complete &quot; tramwaysisation,&quot; if we may coin the word,. of London, as envisaged by Mr. Gordon, or the construction of trans-metropolitan fur-track shallow railways for express trains as suggested by the Royal Commission of 1905.Your Committee have abstained from probing too deeply the question of new arterial roads propounded in principle by the Local Government Board Conference two or three years before the war, though they feel that a Supreme Traffic Authority would to-day necessarily view these recommendations from the point of view of modern requirements and potential developments in forms of transport.Your Committee have likewise felt that their investigations being ad hoe to what they hope is a temporary evil, would not be justified in any extension to the consideration of town planning, and only incidentally to the housing issue, which, in relation to traffic facilities, ought at once to receive the closest attention of the Ministry of Health. For the same reason, they only animadvert briefly on the total inadequacy of the Thames bridges and the unfortunate lack of communications between wharves and railways. The need for the electrification of all surface lines dealing with suburban traffic is similarly obvious, but the problem is too vast except for experts prepared to deal with systems, ways and means.18. In considering the problem of omnibus traffic, where reform can be immediately effected, and with relatively little dislocation of public convenience, and the avoidance of waste of invested capital, your Committee have more concrete views. Their abstention from detailed consideration of what may be called the permanent and expansive issues of the traffic problem is intentional, but they wish none the less to put on record the view that any Authority which may be brought into existence must face and take action on every one of. the lines of policy briefly cited. They do not consider that it would be possible to avoid, even if it were desired, synchronised action to some extent on each and all of them.One reform which does call urgently for attention is the existing system of carting goods through the crowded streets at all hours of the day; also heavy merchandise delivered from the docks to railway stations by vans, which could be better transmitted by rail if the necessary con-connections were used or made.The Committee cannot pass from this without pointing out that the present generation has seen but one new bridge constructed across the river, namely, the Tower Bridge, and that in London from the Tower to Hammersmith a distance of 10 miles there are only eleven vehicular bridges, whereas in Paris within the walls&apos; of the city a distance of seven miles the Seine is crossed by twenty-three bridges.NeAV structures are overdue, and although various projects have during the last twenty years been put forward, opposed, and then relegated to oblivion, it seems to be forgotten that the demerits of specific proposals if they are demerits do not detract from the excellence of the main principle which inspired them. It is also worthy of consideration whether the many river wharves, without railway facilities, are well fitted for the use which is made of them to pour a constant outflow of slow-moving traffic into already crowded streets. As regards arterial roads, some plans are already substantially ready (L.G.B. Conference 1913-16), yet, except in connection with the new thoroughfare to. the West, there is no sign of activity.In this connection your Committee notice the interesting, if controversial, suggestion made by the Walthamstow Tramway Manager to the effect that his Council would undertake the necessary street widenings for tramway extension if they could be guaranteed against omnibus competition which might deprive them of the revenue essential to pay for the large capital outlay. A Supreme Traffic Authority should certainly consider and decide on any such proposition, under which the local authority should be held responsible for coping with all demands for transport facilities, since it would acquire what would be practically a monopoly. Your Committee, indeed, consider that lo?al authorities insistent upon better transport facilities from third parties must face the question *of themselves giving financial assistance to new schemes.* The Bill of the L.C.C. promoted this session in Parliament for the linking up of the north and south tramways, which was strongly recommended by the Royal Commission of 1905, was rejected by the Standing-Orders Committee of the House of Commons because of the lact that the local authorities concerned had vetoed its promotion under Standing Order No. 22. There can be no more glaring case of the inexpediency of the veto than this. As a result Parliament was deprived of the opportunity of considering the scheme,
THE FUTURE OF TAXI-CABS.19. The taxi-cab problem has occupied the attention ot your Committee and, in their opinion, the evidence clearly shows that though this may be a secondary aspect of London Traffic it has much importance if properly controlled and sympathetically handled. Perhaps those who gave evidence seemed to overlook the fact that the taxi-cab may well serve the purposes of all classes ot the community.There wore on April 30,1919, 4,742 taxi-cabs on the streets as against 8,287 in 1913-the high water mark for this form of transport. There are always more drivers than cabs available the number of licensed drivers is now about 10,000.Your Committee consider that the time has arrived for a readjustment of fares on the basis of one shilling for the first mile and threepence for each subsequent quarter mile, with increased fares for distances outside a central area. Ihe figures which have been placed before them, largely by courtesy of the Home Office, show that the industry is carried on with difficulty while the present method of charging fares does not respond to public needs or requirements.In the opinion of your Committee the entire control of cabs should be at once transferred to the suggested Supreme Traffic Authority. Your Committee recommend more cab ranks in London, and that the regulation be strictly enforced that two-thirds of all cabs on every rank must be liable for immediate hire,and the driver be compelled to take the-first fare; and that all cab ranks, where possible, should be in side streets.Your Committee recommend that all restrictions on the use of railway stations be removed, that all regulations and obligations as between the driver and the fare, and the remedy for any breach thereof be clearly set out in every cab giving the number, the name and address of the driver, and that better regulations be made for indicating whether a cab is or is not really plying for hire by day or night. These and other similar points on which your Committee think reform is possible may well be dealt with by the Supreme Authority.RISE IN FARES.20. The criticism of the existing high fares introduced in connection with all means of transport in London is largely attributable to inability on the part of the public to understand the principles upon which they are levied. Voluminous evidence has been laid before your Committee designed to show that the charges are inevitable, that they are relatively not excessive, and that they are not more than are warranted by the labour and other conditions under which the respective undertakings are carried on to-day. On this there is a measure of surprising agreement between the competing organisations, though such surprise is largely discounted by the apparent fact that the upward movement of fares is, if not concerted, at least very sympathetic. Indeed, the history of the L.C.C. Tramway undertaking shows that while public opinion or the fear of it has tended to keep the fares down, even to the detriment of the working of the concern as a whole, an increase by any one authority is followed by similar action on the part of the others.In view or the evidence laid before your Committee it is fair to admit the claim of both the Tramways and the &quot; Combine &quot; to make some increase in their fares, so long as it is accepted that actual capital is entitled to a reasonable return on its outlay.21. The guiding principle which seems to have actuated the &quot; Combine &quot; in its raising of fares was to charge each particular passenger as much as he could be expected to pay; the County Council proceeded on the basis of reducing the penny distance to the minimum compatible with raising the sum of money needed, in its: opinion, to meet all its liabilities. As a result, there is not the slightest effort at uniformity of fares, save under the stress of competition, and anomalies have come into existence which are difficult to justify, and should, be remedied. These are only accentuated by the adherence of the main line railways to emergency orders of the Goyern-ment to increase fares 50 per cent., which, designed to restrain traffic, has completely failed in its effect. Your Committee have come to the conclusion that while some increases of fares were inevitable these are now in some cases far too high, while the general financial policy which renders them necessary is open to question.22. In your Committees opinion some reform is possible and might be tentatively introduced into the working scheme of a concern which admits that while its vehicles are utterly congested at certain periods of the day when enforced use is made of them by the public at specified fares, at all other times, when traffic is largely dependent on good will towards the opportunities offered, the same vehicles are compelled to run if official statistics are to be accepted at a dead loss. Your Committee would have supposed that the elasticity in respect of fares found to be of the utmost value in provincial cities would have been more appreciated in London. Nor do they approve the system followed by the &quot;Combine&quot; in varying autocratically fares according to particular districts. This is a principle which has never been officially recognised in traffic control in this country, and your Committee hope it never will. It has led to unfair discrimination as against certain districts in which, quite as much as at home, the workers are obliged to travel, and the argument that it is aimed at the well-to-do is, in their opinion, puerile.23. Traffic facilities should be afforded on a basis common to all, particularly when as a result of a contrary policy many fares are fixed in comparison with the short. distance permitted for travel at a level, which, judged by any standard, is unfair. The converse is equally true. Indeed, if any illustration be needed of the resultant chaos it is supplied by the &quot;Woolwich municipal authorities, Avho adduce the facts that for the nine miles from that Borough to Charing Cross &quot; the third-class return railway fare is now Is. 9d., the
corresponding tramway fare is 8d,, and the omnibus fare Is. 2d.,&quot; and complain of the dearness of the first-named. Your Committee recommend that season tickets on all railways in the Metropolitan Area should be issued by all companies on the same basis and pro rata for shorter periods.24. Your Committee are quite aware that the official answer of all the transport agencies to criticisms oi fares is that the &quot; average&apos;&apos; works out quite fairly for the public. In your Committees opinion this &quot; average&quot; system can be used to correct self-created anomalies, to cover up inefficiencies of working, to meet loss on experimental operations, which under present conditions ought not to be permitted, Your Committee Avere,informed that this system of fare-fixing is a &quot;scientific business.&quot; That is their complaint; and they can appreciate the resentment of the passenger penalised both on &apos;bus and tram by short sections of distance at relatively high rates as a sort of set-off against some aspect of traffic Avhich he neither understands nor is concerned with.Your Committee consider that the first duty of a Supreme Traffic Authority Avould be not solely to see whether the sum of money raised by the increases of fares was adequate for the purposes of meeting legitimate liabilities, or claims, but Avhether it Avas properly raised, Avhether having regard to all the machinery of the undertaking it Avas rightly, justly and necessarily raised. The (matter is urgent, and your Committee suggest that in the interest of the public, which is still defraying the charges, attention should be immediately paid to this question by the Supreme Traffic Authority.25. There remains another important matter with which your Committee deal elseAvhere, viz,, the criticisms Avhich can be and should be directed towards Avhat one may call general policy in respect both of the L.C.C and the &quot; Combine.&quot; Your Committee consider there is much Avhich no Authority having poAver and energy could have possibly approved had it existed in the past seven years, Matters of Jthis nature affect primarily errors of omission rather than commission, but your Committee are inclined to believe that to them must be attributed not a little of the heavy charges Avhich are now being placed on the community, Avhile they are decreed as inevitable OAving to the operation of causes over Avhich L.C.C. and &quot; Combine&quot; alike maintain thev have no control. No doubt, as has been said above, increased charges would in any event have been necessary, but they neither ought to have been, nor ought to be, as heavy as they are.ASPECTS OF MUNICIPAL POLICY.26. The County Council evidence has not failed to convey the impression, whether intended oi not, that it has always felt it Avas fighting a losing battle in respect of tranrway promotion and extension, No doubt divided counsels haA^e been largely to blame for this. -The Avhole under-taking has provided a ground for bitter municipal polemics Avhich are largely responsible for the troubles of the management, though it should not be overlooked that in the trarmvays the Londoner of to-day possesses an asset Avhich, unofficially but Avith considerable accuracy, may be Valued at sixteen million sterling.One Avould have thought that Avhen the trannvays had been adopted by all sections oi municipal opinion as a part of unchangeable policy, there would have been absolute unanimity hi securing their success and prosper^. The lack of driving force behind every proposal put forward makes your Committee doubt it. The Council has too often vainly evolved scheme after scheme of extension, and your Committee feel, Avithout promising their support to all or specific details, that very few have been treated Avith that measure of consideration they have deserved. It is therefore obvious to your Committee that unless this campaigning against perfectly reputable and justifiable ideals is promptly modified no real reform in London traffic as a Avhole can be anticipated. So long as the County Council stands for civic enterprise as against municipal preferences, it deserves to enjoy a volume of authority Avhich assuredly it does not possess at present. Such authority will only be accorded to its proposals by a supreme controlling body which will vieAv problems from the broadest and most impartial standpoint&quot;.Your Committee further consider that it is essential that there should be equal financial treatment of all surface means of locomotion which exist by an appeal to passenger traffic. They regard the rating of the trams, and their contribution toAvards the maintenance of the surface of the roads, as compared Avith the immunity of the omnibuses from both these charges, as indefensible, and there are, in their opinion, no counterbalancing considerations of sufficient magnitude to induce them to modify this view. At the same time, they do not propound any specific means of dealing Avith this problem, Avhich would be one of the duties entrusted to the suggested Traffic Authority for recommendation to Parliament.27. Your Committee do not hoAvever consider that some aspects of the policy of the County Council are such as commend themselves. It is not characterised by either as much foresight or as much progressiveness as one Avould expect. There Avas hardly sufficient foresight in the provision of rolling stock, either before the Avar or even during it. It is indeed surprising that in vieAv of the still more acute congestion anticipated in the coming Avinter the Council should still, according to the evidence tendered, have ordered no neAV cars since the Armistice, but rely apparently on the repair of the old ones to meet the public demand for transport. In this connection the Tramway General Manager admitted that &quot;1,500 cars would clear the congestion at the present time &quot; a statement Avhich Ave chronicle without accepting-and yet remarked that &quot;it would be rather overdoing it to run this number at the present time.&apos;&apos;
Your Committee notice that sufficient power exists to run this full number of cars; they would like to feel that the Council is, in this respect, looking not merely a, little but far ahead. Much evidence has, too, been given regarding the regulation and control of tramway traffic, and while your Committee appreciate the difficulties it is inclined to the view that reforms could be introduced, and probably would have been introduced but for the curious apprehensiveness which seems to be entertained by the officials of the department as to the results of experimental working, which would speedily show their value or the reverse. The traffic of London can never be properly regulated by a preference for the observance of theoretical principles. ,.OMNIBUSES AND UNDERGROUND RAILWAYS.28. Your Committee appreciate the value of omnibus transport to London, but all experience, notably of the last few years, demonstrates the urgent need for a regulating authority to deal with these vehicles. Such evidence, too, as they have heard does not convince them that the &quot; Combine &quot; in the last year of the war and after the Armistice might not have advantageously to a large extent supplemented its existing vehicles from other concerns than the Associated Equipment Company, which is really part of their own organisation. The principle of practically confining orders to this company may be mutually of benefit to both, though not necessarily helpful to the public. In fact, they regard the results as rather evidence to the contrary. Your Committee do not accept the suggestion of the &quot; Combine &quot; that the existing congestion is largely due to lack of rolling stoch, if by this it is contended that the. shortage alone, as compared with pre-war supplies, is solely responsible. Moreover, the relations of the &quot; Combine &quot; and the police in respect of the suitability of omnibuses merely to mention one instance of several seem to be productive of delay in the provision of up-to-date vehicles, although the whole system of police inspection and licensing of omnibuses is archaic, unbusinesslike, and utterly subversive of progress. In face of present conditions it is regrettable that the &quot; Combine &quot; have been for two years experimenting to produce a post-war omnibus which the police would pass, ,and yet at present not one of the new type is on the streets.29. As regards the Underground Railways under the control of the &quot; Combine,&quot; there is much your Committee wish in all fairness to eulogise, so that at least criticisms cannot be resented. But they do not consider that the actual running of the trains is in accordance with the schedules. They chronicle the fact to show that very substantial improvement ought to be possible, but no real incentive for reform exists so long as the most scandalous overcrowding, so far as any remedy is concerned, is left to the tender mercies of the &quot; Combine &quot; itself. &quot; Straphanging &quot; is now regarded not as a temporary misfortune of travelling, but as a natural commonplace, and from this to the recognition of overcrowding as a permanent feature of passenger transport is but an easy step.Your Committee think that the designs of the new carriages submitted by the Metropolitan and District Railways so far as exits and entrances are concerned are a great improvement on the existing rolling-stock, but they are not altogether satisfied that the best is being-done for the regulation of platform congestion. No doubt the shortage of rolling stock on some of the lines hampers expansion, but in this case it would also appear that more efficient foresight as to the growth of traffic would have produced a far earlier increased provision of carriages.It is, in view of the recent drastic changes, too early yet to speak with confidence regarding the &quot;Combine&quot; tramways, but the explanations regarding the shortage of rolling stock do not appear wholly satisfactory, in view of the number of cars actually possessed. Your Committee think that the running of both &quot; Combine&quot; /buses and trams on exactly the same routes is a practice which, from the public standpoint, is indefensible.PUBLIC REPRESENTATIONS.30. Having invited the public to lay before us suggestions for possible improvements in dealing with the congestion of traffic, your Committee feel that they must put on record their appreciation of the vast response which has been made. It is true that a great many of the communications have covered the ground which has been dealt with above, but there are subsidiary matters to which attention may be called since they show the close attention with which the whole question has been followed. Thus many recommend that motor bus companies should be compelled to introduce workmen&apos;s tickets. Your Committee approve this course, particularly since in the abortive negotiations with the London County Council in 1915-16 the &quot;Combine&quot; accepted this principle. Others urge a greater equality in the relative provision made by the different main lines for cheap trains. The disparity between the number of such trains run, for instance, on the Great Eastern, and on other lines is very great. There is also naturally strong opinion in favour of the re-opening of the many railway stations closed during the war on account of shortage of labour.Much, too, has been said in favour of the widening of platforms ,at busy tube stations (though &quot;riginally the London County Council, against the wishes of the builders, specifically limited the size); in favour of the re-arrangement of booking windows; of the provision of more intelligent direction and non-stop signboards; of the abandonment of running coaches on- the tubes *ith certain of the doors not in use during what are supposed to be the quiet hours of the day; of lie regulation of passengers using the platforms; of through running of trams over all routes; of sjhe introduction of exchange tickets, even if this would entail more work on the part of the twenties concerned. ..........&apos; ^
Printed by Wyman &amp; sons, Ltd., Fetter Lane, London, E.C.31, Another problem which is too vast for cursory settlement is that of some modification voluntary or otherwise, of the existing system of the hours of Avorkmen and employees generally so as to avoid the Avhole of the business traffic being thrown on the means of transport twice a day at the same period, and your Committee are of opinion that the New Traffic Authority should devote its attention immediately to this aspect of the problem. It is also clear that the public are strongly in favour of queues,   There is also a disposition to regret the abolition of strip tickets.There are also numerous criticisms that the regulation of traffic in the Metropolitan Police area is not as good as it might be, and that the crushes both at tram and &apos;bus stopping points might be far better controlled. &quot;With details, hoAvever, of obvious minor changes your Committee is less concerned since these Avould naturally be taken up at once by a Supreme Traffic Authority, nor has it deemed itself called on to discuss such broad issues as the municipalisation of all means of transport which Avere raised by one or tAvo witnesses, but Avhich cannot be regarded at the present time Avithin the limits of actuality.CONCLUSION.32. Your Committee would conclude this Report by again unanimously emphasizing the point Avith Avhich they commenced it, The immediate need one Avhich transcends every other matter of urgency by its direct and dominating influence on the problem of London traffic, by its universal recognition by every Committee or Commission Avhich has considered the subject, by its general acceptance by every person whose opinion is Avorthy of Aveight is the speedy establishment of an effective and fully empowered Supreme Traffic Authority on the lines of our recommendation, That is the foundation on Avhich alone the solution of the London Traffic problem can be successfully undertaken.33. Without it there can be no adequate alleviation nor permanent solution. In our vieAV there rests a great and grave responsibility on the Government to effect its early establishment. Each day which elapses before action is taken will add materially to that fast accumulating responsibility.SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS.Congestion :-  .,The immediate creation of a Supreme Traffic Board for Greater London. Radius: Metropolitan Police Area. Membership: Five as a maximum.PoAvers: All those noAV possessed by existing Bodies or conferable by Statute.Authority: Executive, Avith right to delegate Avhere desired.Special Functions: To Co-ordinate routes and services of all systems of transport.Regulate all traffic and street repairs, be. responsible for the comfort and convenience of the Public, provide for future developments, and promote legislation to desired ends.Fares :-While some increase Avas inevitable in vieAV of post-war conditions, the neAv fares are in cases excessive, in others unjust, and too manipulated to be understood by the public. Greater uniformity is essential and anomalies must be eliminated. The policies entailing such increases are open to criticism.The fares for taxi-cabs should be raised to Is. for the first mile Avith 3d. for each subsequent quarter of a mile.  Increased fares outside the Central Area.
