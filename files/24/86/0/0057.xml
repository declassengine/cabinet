It is considered that the present situation in Esthonia - Is not all that can ba desired, and that this is considerably affected by the situation existing in the Russian Berth Western Army.      The latter is consistently requesting the despatch of further stores and munitions, and Mr. Bosanquot reports that the non-arrival of these stores is having a marked effect on the troops.3.   Bolshevik agents and the local pro-Bolshevik press are busy fostering the idea of peace between Esthonia and Soviet -Russia, and this idea appears to be gaining ground.      The Esthonian Government at the. same time fears an advance in the direction of Minsk, by the Russian liorth tfestern Army, which would open the front and docido the fate, cf Eathonia. - On the other, hand, Yudenitch fears that the Esthonian Ar..y is veering to the left.   The Bsthonian Minister of foreign Affairs states that unless esthonia is recognised by the Allies, it will be difficult to induce the troops to do more than otand on the defensive, and that such is difficult to maintain for any length of time.4.   As will be seen from the telegram, Admiral Cowan is pressing urgently the-need of stating a line of policy towards esthonia as-, early as possible.  . General Cough and LLr. Bosanouet have also advocated some form of recognition.6.   Full recognition of Esthonian independence would have an important bearing on the future of Reval, and My Lords are inclined to think that Bussia in the future must have Reval,. not only as a ilaval port but also as a Commercial outlet.6.   I am to recuest that the Secretary of State may inform Their Lordships what reply should be sent to the Senior $aval Officer, Baltic.7.   I am to add that a copy of this lettor has boen sent to the War Office, and also to the &quot;Tar Cabinet.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,.The Secretary of State, ----FOREIGN Oi^ICB.
