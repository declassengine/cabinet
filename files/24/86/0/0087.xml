-niment.REDUCTION OIT STAFFS IN GOVERNMENT DEPARTMESOTS.f FOR TIIE WAR CABINET BY THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY.J Lr n (iAs the figures given in the President of the Board of Trade&apos;s Memorandum (G.T.7918) mav be erron-     * eously supposed to refer to the staff enroloval at the Admiralty, and to be at variance with figures that Ihave myself recently given in regard to Admiralty staff, I think it well to mention that Sir A, Oeudes^ figures include all civil staff (other than workoeoole) employed at the follow.?ng:-Portsmouth ( Devonport ( Chatham * Sheerness Rosyth PembrokeDockyards.Invergorclon Naval Yard.

Greenock Torpedo Factory.Further the number of establishments included in the July return is greater than was included in the returns for Armistice clay and 31st i trch. and many classes of employees who were omitted in the earlier returns have how been included as a result of instructions given to the various Establishments who were at first uncertain as to the scope of the return.   This explains the apparent increase in the numbers employed at the latest date.    If the returns had been drawn&quot; up on the same basis throughoutdates on the basis adopted for the July return.(Sgd) W0H. Long.11th August * 1919.
