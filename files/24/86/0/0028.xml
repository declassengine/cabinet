It is important for the success of the Flax Production Scheme administered by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries that the establishment of more natural economic con-ditions should not be delayed.(2)   It has been v ought to my notice that certain flax-growers in Ireland consider themselves aggrieved by the financial support given by Government to the development of flax production in Great Britain.    We have gained experience which should be of great value to those responsible for the proposed scheme in Ireland, and we should also profit by their experience.    I should regard them not as rivalB, but as welcome partners in a common enterprise of great national importance.I cannot express any opinion on the details of the two proposals or on the suitability of the promoters.A.G, BOSCAOT.Oth August, 1919.
