PBiMA]im^EAM-..poLlGY.   ^&apos;:l^2^iTSIrKP the proper 904    ^   i ---.....- i......LB&amp;nnlc PAJeSp^a^eiiol^naura by the President of the Board of Trade.In the interests of trade and the financial stability of the country it is Necessary that the Government sh ould announce ^definitely at a very early date its policy with regard to imports.At present we are working under a transitional arrangement formulated at the Unemployment and State of Trade Conference in February and March and announced in tho House of Commons on March 10 th.    The administrative protections given in&apos;accordance with this interim policy expire on 1st September next, and as its im-perfections, which are already causing irritation, increase with the lapse of time, its continuance after September 1st may be regarded as.out of the question.It is impossible to formulate a definite import policy except as part of a general trade policy.    &quot;i have accordingly found it as necessary &amp;3 it is desirable to outline for the consideration of the Cabinet a comprehensive industrial and commercial programme^.The central fact with regard to British trade is that as a result of the war the cost of production in British factories has markedly increased in terms of currency, especially under the heads cost of labour and cost of pjDwer..     In many industries there. h&amp;Sj. been an increased money cost of raw materials, but, except in so far as it is due to freight charges, thi3 is cf less imporbanoe from the point -of view of international competition, since the price   of raw materials is normally a world price which has to-.be paid by all natjons.It&apos; is no dQubt a fact that in other countries also labour and,^ power will continue to cost more in money than they did formerly, and that we are not therefore logically compelled to take a gloomy view o,f the prospects of British export trade seeing that the world has been starved of goods and that people&apos;s minds will become accustomed to what are now high-so-unding prices.     But we have, nevertheless, in my opinion, to pass through an extremely difficult time.&apos; It may be assumed&apos; that the returns which can in many cases be realised (after allowing for rates of exchange) by the sale of foreign goods in this country are relatively highv.   Also prices in other countries&apos;may cecline while ours absolutely must be kept up to a certain level because a fall in money wages here is out of&quot; the question for some time to corne.      Consequently goods ; are being strongly attracted to this country already and may be attracted in increasing quantities?    Moreover, there is an accumulated head of manufactured goods in certain countries, which, on the removal of import restrictions, will tend to overflow into this country.     It is true that other outlets for these goods will be ooened up by the lifting of the blockade, so taat concentration on this country need not be apprehended, but as other markets will not have recovered their absorptive power for some time to come, many of our manufactures will still be unusually dependent on the home market.
Doubtless, additional imports will do more than anything else to break the present vicious circle of rising cost of,living and of wages rising to meet it on the one hand, and on the other hand undermine the present disposition to keep for more profitable sale at home goods that might be disposed of abroad on reasonab lo terms;   but the problem is to prevent their admission in overwhelming quantities.Apart from administrative restrictions there are clearly but three methods - of which taro are really feasible - by which the inflow of goods can be kept within moderate limits.ffiie first - which is not feasible - is at once to resume &quot;unrestricted gold payments against notes and allow bullion to leave the country freely,    This would limit the entry of good, by causing a slump in home prices, and en-courage export.    But as money wages are guaranteed for a time and even in the absence of a guarantee could not conceivably be reduced as things are without causing grave social disturbance, this possibility may be ruled out,. She second method is to adopt a tariff on imports and thus get the desired check, not by forcing home prices beneath foreign costs, but by adding import duties to foreign costs.    (Phis method, it may be observed incident-ally, would not, without differentiation against Germany, ;revent German goods from displacing goods from other countries in our home market and it might not even prove an effective dam against a flood of goods from Germany as her recovery may be rapid and she might be compelled to sell abroad at great sacrifices in order to get the means of satisfying her most urgent requirements.The third method is simply to let the Exchanges go -to a large extent at any rate - thus applying the needed corrective through the loss on exchange sufferod by importers here and the gain on exchange made by our Exporters.    This method, it should be noted, has defects similar to those of an undiscriminating tariff in ijbs bearing on imports from GermanyAfter most careful consideration I have come to the conclusion that the balance of advantage rests with the policy of protection by adverse Exchanges, combine.i first with a tariff policy in connection with certain weak essential industries, secondly with an administrative exclusion policy . in respect of the products of &quot;pivotal&quot; or &quot;key&quot; industries that need fostering, thirdly with the
sane policy in respect of any goods of enemy origin that menanco British industries, end fourthly with an adequate ant 1-dump in;?; policy to cover the whole field cf British industry.The full policy which i recommend 1b:-1. Abandonment of any support of the exchanges except in so far as it should be necessary to prevent complete collapse.Z* protection of all industries against dumping which should be widely interpreted not only to prevent the sale of goods&quot; in this country their      beneath/price in the country of origin, but also to protect British industries against the competition of goods which are cheap because in their production the wages paid and hours worked are not in accordance&quot; with the general standard of the country of origin,3. Postering of unstable key industries by the prohibition of imports except under licence;   fees to be charged for licences not exceeding the difference in value between c.i.f. price ship&apos;s side and home production price; &quot;and all industries in the&quot;key&quot; class to be under G-government control.4, Protection of unstable essential industries by import duties;   all industries with tariff pro-teotion to bo liable to Government control as regards price.S. State co-operation involving financial participation where necessary with certain large, industries to such extent and subject to such conditions as may be requisite to secure large scale production orl the most efficient and economical lines.wm 3&quot;&quot;
6.   The promotion of industrial efficiency by the encouragement of industrial research and the furnishing of facilities for standardisation^,7.   The exercise by the Board of Trade of a general oversight over&quot;supplies of raw materials and co-operation with tho industries concerned to ensure the provision of adequate and suitable, supplies of raff materials so far as any action is requisite 08*&quot;&apos;Imperial preference in connection with all-tariffs and Import restrictions;,   and, in eonneot-ion with the provision of materials, the development of Imperial resources.9a All imports to be subject to registration for which a fee would be charged.10.   for a period of five years the Board of Trade to be empowered to schedule   for import prohibition, except on licence, any goods of enemy origin, if found necessary for the protection of British industries; fees for licences to be charged equal to the differ-enco between the import price and price in this country.11. Restoration of the Exchanges where these have collapsed.12.   Government action, through Consular and Commercial Attach^ services and otherwise, to secure or develop marine ts overseas.13.   The safeguarding of the public and the economic system against the effects of domestic and inter-national business combinations so far as they prove harmfule14,   The regular collection of information about pro-duction, prices, costs and profits.I need not emphasise that the most vital question&quot; to settle relates to the import of the product mf Industrie that have not been scheduled as &quot;key&quot; or as &quot;essential&quot; industries in an unstable position.    With regard to these
goods, I have carefully considered whether it would not be advisable as a purely temporary measure, to impose import duties of say 10% all round on completely manufactured imports and on 0emi-manufactured imports in so far as a large proportion of their value is due to labour; but on balance I have decided against this expedient.The main arguments in favour of such temporary import duties would seem to be that the pressure on the Foreign Exchangee would be to some extent relieved by their operation; that imported food and raw materials, which would be exempt from import duties might be cheaper , anti that many producers would be given a greater sense of security.But against this there are disadvantages to reckon ,   A tariff would not by any means be of benefit all round and it might materially reduce our exporting opportunities (which it is vital to make the most of) both through its incidence on means of production (e.g, machinery) and through its influence on the exchange a.There is every reason to suppose that the policy I have recommended will best meet the requirements of the abnormal conditions with which we are confronted.   Excess of imports will be checked by decline  exchangee, which will also encourage exports; while security will be increased by a sound anti-dumping policy, plus tariff protection of weak essential industries, plus exclusion, except under licence of the products of unstable &quot;Key&quot; industries, and of any ^oods of enemy origin that threaten to flood the market.Whatever course of action is adopted, the immediate future is beset with difficulties and everything possible should be dona to smooth the way for producers and exporters.   An effort should certainly be made to get the means of international payment restored where they have broken down.   The problem of preparing outlets for; British exports is of the first order of importance both in connection&apos; with the exchanges and to furnish employment in the&quot; country at a time when the purchasing capacity of many of our old markets will be greatly reduced.   To get our necessary imports we roust export more than we used to do.   Broadly speaking by sale of overseas securities and by borrowing abroad our imports on account of interest on loan3 must have been reduced by a figure exceeding  100,000,000,   It is true that loans have been made by us to our Allies and oversera parts of the Empire to an amount that should yield annually a gain in imports not far short of this loss but these payments cannot by any means be depended upon.The central economic problem for us is one of exports, and tbugh there is undoubtedly, an immense latent demand to satisfy after a world scarcity has existed for so long, it must be recognised that&apos; we start with the handicap of having to win back markets and confronted by the fact that about  75,000,000 (at pre-war -valftee): of our exports used to go to enemy countries and parts of Europe noft in a state of disorganisation, while about  60,000,000 used to go in addition to our European Allies   who are no longer in a position to purchase as much   general merchandise as they did previously.
J.\Kji.p.ke up* for the .....^trtl-.^w5^4 --/prcvi4e foTHteiJL^c?8^^^ of expos/Irs that is ntfoe&amp;eary, a Im-myd&apos;&apos;&apos; &quot;paULcy roust &quot;be pursued and in partia^aar Imperial trade ohouId be fostered.   The eccaxrwgemer/c of this trade is in the interests alike of the Overseas parts of the Em pi re.-and of the Mother Country j and it should, be-rrted that in addition to Imperial preference the policy with leg-arc&apos; to exchanges and raw materials made in thie memorandum :ln themselves do something toincrease it.   By the to^I^jrv.;:.&apos;:;. of Imperial Sources of raw material, means of paying for mare imports from the Mother country will be furnished;,: and a policy- which stimulates our exports will, at the same time increase the market here for Empire products.Further, in connection with the policy as regards general imports here advocated consideration should be given to the possibility of;making early provision for future payments for food, and as far as possible without borrowing abroad, in order both to check the tendency for the cost of food to rise when exchanges with the United States become more adverse, and to avoid a jolt at the beginning of September,I should not be satisfied with the policy advocated above, so far as it relates to industrial security  if the negative method of shielding by tariffs and import restrictions were not accompanied by positive action to promote industrial efficiency,   tin the case of the scheduled key and essential industriesv general supervision by the Board of Trade i-j recommended, and I have fa.rth.or prarpos-ed that industrial efficiency should be encouraged generally through-, facilities in connection with standard;! samion and industrial research.I am confident however, that we cannot afford to alloy State interest in this matter to stop at such a point&apos;,: particularly in view of tre present positron of two great branches of production , namely, Iron and Steel and Organic Chemicals, which are of vital national importance both for purposes of defence and as the basis of modern industry,   A lessor but nevertheless important industry which calls for investigation is that of Spelter.Early in the War cur weakness in respect of all these three branches of production, and the serious consequences resulting therefrom, sere; realisod4   rs regards Iron and Steel active measures of financial sappert conditional upon satisfactory methods of production ana management were improvised by the Ministry, of Munitions., and similar action was taken in respect of certain classes of Chemical workst   Seme of the schemes adopted in the Iron and Steel Industry did net, owing to a variety of adverse cir-cumstances come to fxuiiion curing the war: but their completion will contribute very matei-is] Xy to our Industrial strength,; I propose that the Government should continue to-.-act along   these lines, but on a more systematic and comprehensive plan.,   Such action clearly involves tit assumption by the Stats of part of the financial responsibility f^r the re-organisation and development of the industries concerned,.and its participation in the consultations of the industries so as to&quot; secure so far as State action can do so that the purposes in view are. achieved.
In connection with the three &quot;branches of industry named   . the essential facts pay be very briefl;  set out;-, ,.   The British, Iron and Steel Industry bad made in the years before\the:war progress whl$]fr: was&apos; very small in comparison with the corresponding industries of the United States and Germany. During the war its development baa not been p;reat.   Steel Reduction rose considerably, but the output of pi&amp;-iron legged far behind^   Qur blast.furnace capacity is far below what the steel industry requires and iron ore mining in this country did not rise beyond a pre-war level,,   Whatever be the future of the German industry the British manufacturers are faced with the competition of a highly efficient and;;elaborately organised American industry, and will have; to,;meet later, that of a thoroughly modernised French industry., (See Appendix III)The British Organic Chemical Industry was as a utole &apos; *-entirely outclassed by :that -of Germany. Public attention has been-largely directed to, the position in respect of Synthetic Ijyestuffs and proposals as to the policy to be   pursued in respectof these, and Synthetic Drugs and Fine Chemicals as unstable &apos; key&quot;- industries are set cut in this Memorandum,,&apos;   But it is of the utmost importance to realise-that the areat position which Germany had attained in respect of the world1s supplies of Dyestuffs, Drugs and Fine Chemicals was due&apos;to the fact that their production was on&quot;Jy the crown of a very far-reaching Chemical industry elaborately organised and equiped with the highest scientific and technical skillc   The Chemical Industry of the United&quot;states is making very rapid progress and if there is to be built up in the United -Kingdom ;an industry capable of meeting our competitors on equal terms and of securing the safety of the nation in future wars jjtate action cannot be limited to Dyestuffs, Drugs end Pine Chemicals but must extend to the whole range of the Indus tryttThe Spelter Industry pt theUnited Kingdom before the war was very ;wealt, and circumstances have&apos; prevented any considerable development during the war*   Whilst:,the Government have acquired control of the main supplies of law materials great difficulties stand in the way of their treatment in the Inited Kingdom, owing chiefly to the High -level of pricing costs as compared with a world2s pries which must for some time be determined (as it was not before the war) by the United States,. Upon adequate supplies of Spelter depend our galvanising and Brass Trades.-7-
With regard to these three industries tariff protection unsupported by positive action  would be hopelessly inadeviuatet It would give no guarantee of reform of methods of production and organisation; it might even have the effect of stereotyping absolute Methods,   a complicated tariff scheme wr?uld be necessary with far-reaching ramifications, and the industriea in question are of such a basic   character that tut.&apos; reactions upon other industries in this country are almost impossible to foresee.   In the case of Iron and steel for instance, duties would have to.be charged not merely on iron and steel material but also, on the manufactured imports into which iron and eteel entered., aa otherwise manufacturers here would rightly comp^ajn   that their material w-i taxed, while they had   to compete against goods made from untaxed material; and drawbacks on export of good3 into which iron and steel entered would have to be introduced for similar reasons.The alternative to a constructive participation policy would therefore.seem to be to leave thing? as they are. Conceivably, reconstruction might be undertaken without State co-operation, but I fear there is little chance of its bein*? carried out on the required scale,, in view Woo th of foreign competition and of- thepresent attitude of the.community to investments of this kind,&apos; The policy recomrended cannot be termed a novel departure after our experiences during the war, the adoption of the dye industry scheme, and what is now projected in connection with railways and coal mine9.*   I believe that the time has come for the State, while the proceeding with thejutmcst caution, to assume responsibilities that were generally regarded before the war as outside the sphere of practical politics; and that it would be prudent statemanahip to take this line in view of the far more revolutionary changes that are being widely advocated.In the paragraphs beneath I have made come brief remarks on the other items in the comprehensive programme which I now unhesitatingly recommend; and in the appendices fuller information is given on salient points.
O 0Protection against pumping,    The scheme of the Board of Trade is assigned to pfeTeirTTajport or first sale in this country at a price beneath that in the country of origin of any goods produced also&quot;in this country4 unless in the ease of goods purchased by importers,; there has &quot;keen paid to the Customs on their import the difference , between the two prices,    St is intended to impose suitable penalties on deliberate infringement, and in addition render it difficult to evade the law, in the case of such classes cf goods as are known to be dumped or likely to be dumped, by providing that : certificates of prioes in the country of origin shall be furnished oV. importation, together with certificates of prices paid if the goods are already purchased.    If the goods are not purchased arrangements are to be made for following up the goods until they are sold.    It is proposed to give the Board of Trade power to schedule articles to be dealt with in this way.    Also the Board of Trade should be given power to schedule for special treatment goods produced by labour earning exceptionally low wages or working exceptionally long hours, regard being paid to general conditions in the country of origin.Protection of Unstable Key Industries,    By pPivetal or Key industries are meant&quot; oTancEes of production which though of relatively small magnitude in themselves are nevertheless of great significance since they ^reduce commodities upon vEaieh larger and important industries are in a great measure dependent.    With reference to these industries the policy proposed ia..i(1)   That the Board of Trade should maintain a constant watch and when necessary recommend the scheduling of any such industry for protection,(2)   That after the scheduling of an industry the Beard should be empowered to prohibit the import exoept on licence of the products of such an indiastry;   that fees should be charged for licenses not exceeding the difference between the home and import prices;   and that in administering the scheme regard should be paid to prices.(3)   That in any case in which it was advisable in addition to encourage a Key Industry by financial assistance, recommendations should, be made by the Board,It is not anticipated that the list of gchodulod Key Iidustries will be a lengthy one.    At the moment the Board of Trade has in mind the follovjing:-Synthetic Dyes.Synthetic Organic fine chemicals. Optical Glass,Lenses, prisms and like optical devices. Hosiery Latch lleedles. Potash Compounds,Tungsten Powder, ferro tungsten and Tungsten wire.In the case of these industries (the position of which is discussed in Appendix I) it is intended that the Board of Trade should, if necessary, effectively control or participate in their management, with a viow to promoting their efficiency and securing their independence at the earliest possible date.
Protoetlon of other Uns table, Eosenfeial -Industries,i    Closely relate! to , and ITi &quot;&quot;some decree ov srTfcpipiHg&quot; wi   &quot;TiKeOKjey Industries are other essential industries, which it is highly desirable to maintain in the country.    Most of these industries aro firmly rooted in the United Kingdom but there are others which for a variety of reasons are at present in a precarious position.    With reference to the latter it is proposed-.-That the Board of Trade should maintain a watch and recommend import duties as barriers against foreign competition when proved to be necessary, it being understood that supervision will be exercised by the Bo&amp;rd.In the opinion of the Board, the list of industries that should now be recommended for tariff shielding need not be a long one;   and sit is important to deal only with those that can present a very strong case for protection.    The articles which the Board have at present in mind are as follows:-Magnetos Chemical Glass Ilium j nating Glas swar e Chemical PorcelainSpecified classes of Electrical Plant,   Apparatus^and Sittings Eubber Tyres Zinc Oxide and Lithopone Gas Mantles and gas mantle rings Thorivmi filtrateSpecified classes of Scientific and SurgicalIroutrumentsGauges of specified kinds and Dividing Engines.iThe position of the industries making these articles and the tariffs suggested are dealt with in Appendix II.It skould be noted that in addition the following articles outside the group of rood drills:&apos;and tobacco are already, subject to import duties:-    Motor cares, including motor bicycles assSd Tricycles accessories ar.u component parts thereof;   matches bxA mechanical lightens;   Cinematograph films, Musical Instruments and accessories and component parts thereof. &apos;State Co-op oration. wi tl^wee^ej^sentj.^ industries.     &quot; These i &quot;123 s ries ml gilt&quot; i 73o$ .e&quot; a?; jTo&quot;f tS.b iurieTieduIsd above, but&apos; they would also include a very limited nvjjtbsr of others in the case of which protection by tariffs or licencing of icports was -unsuitable.     5.&apos;he chief problem that presses for immediate solution relates to the iron aud steel tiade.    This is a question of the first order of impeltareThe plan proposed has been described and ciserseed above; and details cf the situation are given in the Appendix III.    Consultation between the Board of Trade and representatives of the industry with a view to the drafting of a scheme for &quot;submission to the Cabinet, would naturally be the first stop.      The Organic Chemicals and Spelter industries should be dealt with similarly.
Promotion of Industrial Research and Standardisation. With regard to Industrial Research, the ? taken its promotion are well known. With regard to the promotion of indistrial efficiency by the ? of ? for the standardisation movement, including the establishment of approved testing houses, action is suggested by the Board of Trade on lines dealt with in Appendix IV.

Co-operation with industries to ensure the provision of raw materials. Certain industries are dependent upon raw materials of which the supply may fail or is insecure because it is largely concertrated in a foreign country. Action on the lines of watching the situation and encouraging new undertakings has already been taken in connection with Flax, Cotton, Potash and one or two otner minor materials.  It is proposed that the Board should continue this work, extend it where necessary and make recommendations concerning, assistance that the Board cannot give with it&apos;s existing powers (see Appendix V).

Imperial preference and development of Imperial resources.

To assist the economic progress of the overseas parts o the Empire and place on a more secure foundation the supplies of certain materials for British nanufacturers. The importance of this, both in itself and as an aid to the consolidation of the Empire, needs no emphasis.

Registration of Imports. (including those brought by parcel post) is delighted to secure more accurate and more detailed returns to serve as a basis far anti-dumping measures and to show how competition stands with reference to any particular British industry. It is proposed that the fee charged should be one per mille ad valorem.

Power to prohibit importation ofgoods of enemy origin except on license. Provision for the exclusion of goods of enemy origin except on license is a precautionary measure to guard against ? flood of German goods that might result from ? of the German need of this means of taking foreign payments. Without some such precaution, moreover, France might pay her debts and interest on her debts by buying and reexporting cheap German goods.

Restoration of collapsed exchanges and Encouragement of Exports. The necessity for t his has been emphasised above. A Bill has lready been prepared authorising State or State aided insurance of certain foreign trade risks.

Combinations.  Business combinations of various kinds particularly for the regulation of sales, prices and output had become a notable feature even before the war  and during the war they have been fostered. In many respects the results may be beneficial, but such guarantee as competition affords that prices and profits should not continue for long at unreasonable rates is removed. There would seem to be no doubt that the Government  will be expected to hold a watching brief on behalf of the public both as a warning to combinations that their operations are not being disregarded and as a preliminary to taking action in time if it should 
become necessary.    Consequently it is proposed.-(a) that the Board of Trade should keep all such combinations under surveillance.(b) that notice should be given to the Board of Trade of any projected Combination in the( case of soheduled key or essential industries and in the  case of banking.(o) that the Board of Trade having satisfied itself that a speoial inquiry is necessary should be authorised to conduct such an inquiry or appoint a tribunal for the   purpose, with powers to require the furnishing of all relevant evidence and information.fd) that on the result of the inquiry the Board of Trade should make such recommendations as regards State action as seem to be called for, and be empowered to require that no projected combination should take place without 13ae authorisation of Parliament in the Oases referred to in clause (b) above.It is a matter for consideration which it is expedient at this stage to incorporate in the policy adopted clause (b) above and the last part of clause (d).    The reference .to banks is unnecessary if tho Bank amalgamation Bill is prooeeded with.    Otherwise the policy proposed is of atientative character.    Possibly proceeding on tentative lines offers the best prospects as it is important not to check the promotion of efficiency and elimination of waste.Collection of information about production, prices, costs and profits. :   InHfrcfir to carry out &quot;ef i&quot;ectiveljfTlie essentiaT parts of the industrial and commercial policy outlined above, the Intelligence Branches of the Government will have to be developed.
developed,    For -a long time, statistical and other infor-mation has heen collected by Government Departments, from, which it has been possible to secure valuable guidance in, the framing of policy and in the detail of admins tration, but it oannot be denied that there are serious deficiencies in the knowledge thus placed at the disposal of the Governments    There are important reasons in connection with the work of other departments as well as of the Board of Trade, why a fuller knowledge of the relevant facts and figures relating to industrial output^ the profits of business undertakings, retail and wholesale prices, and costs of production in the case of certain industries is essential to the Government,    For example, the movement towards the consolidation of business in fewer hands, and the ma3d.ng of selling agreements, necessitate the maintenance of a closer watch than in the past, particularly in view of the suspicion that has been and will be developed in the minds of the wage-earners that such combinations are inimical to their interests, and of the unrest to which it may give rise.    Consequently it is proposed;-(a) That the collection of information regarding the movement of prices, both wholesale and retail, which has been carried out during the war more systematically than before, and of the information regarding the cost of living, should be continued and developed,(b) That power should be given to investigate costs of production and distribution in the scheduled key aoad other essential industries and in any other oases in which it was found desirable.(c) That the information secured through the Census of Production should be expanded in some respects, in particular so as to include capital and profits, and that this information should in substance be secured annually and be made more available for Government Departments.The Census of Production was taken for the first time in reference to the year 19C7? and was to be quinquennial.    The particulars for 1912 were in process of compilation when the War broke out, and the usefulness of the class of information thus secured was demonstrated repeatedly in the course of the war.    But the limited character of the information and the hampering nature of the restrictions under which the Census was taken, have also been brought out, and the deficiencies thus revealed should as far as possible be amended in future enquiries. Such enquiries, too, Should furnish the Government with up-to-date information,and the principal facts,, if not. the whole of the details f should therefore be ascertained yearly.    It is also desirable that; in :*
addition to particulars of goods made, some financial statement should be required to be formulated by each firm or Company, on a uniform plan So arranged that the ^amount of the capital employed, and its rate of earning, should be shown or be easily deduced.Such information would, of oourse, be confidential, and adequate safeguards would be provided that the position of any particular firm should not be made public in any statements prepared from the returns to be secured, but it would be desirable to make the ii;... information obtained available for the confidential use of Government Departments in. oonneotlon with the par ormanoe-of their duties.A,C, GBDDBS-Board of Trade June 3rd, 1919,
Articles competing with the products of un-stable, ^ey TnfTiisfees TEe &quot; importation jyfon licence. &quot;The Board of Trade propose that the list of scheduled key industries should comprise those mentioned below.    Notes are added explaining the position in respect of each article:-Synthetic Dyea*For these our great export and home trade in dyed and printed textiles, and a number of.other trades, relied practically entire-ly upon Germany, with the result that at the outbreak of war a large volume of employment and a very important portion of the ex-port trade of the country was seriously imperilled,     (with respect to these, a scheme is already in operation).^jftetlo Organic Fine Chemicals other than Dyes.Includes synthetic drugs, Synthetic antiseptics, etc. Synthetic Photographic Chemicals (many of which are also ayestuff  . intermediates) Synthetic Tannins, Synthetic Perfumes, Flavourings and essential oil (some of which are intermediate products).The operations concerned introducing these synthetics are the same as those involved in malting dyesB   Many of the substances can only be made at commercial prices if the manufacture be carried out concurrently with the production of dyes.     The present system whereby certain of these substances have been produced in special small factories carrying on no other industry cannot produce at reasonable prices and thus will not live in the face of competition.Optical Glass.The position before the War as regards Optical Glass was that the whole home output amounted to only about one-tenth of peace requirements;   of the remainder about one-third came from Prance and two-thirds from Germany,   The result was that the British makers of Optical Instruments, including binoculars, photographic lenses and microscopes and spectacles, were largely dependent upon foreign supplies of optical glass and when the War broke out we were quite unprepared to meet the vastly in-creased laval and Military denrmds for optical instruments.Lense3,^Prisms^and like optical devices (with worked surfaces including combination of such devices mounted in cells for use in optical instruments!,The manufacture of optical glass is distinct from that of making lenses prisms, etc&quot;; and mounting theni.   The Brass working and finishing operations involved in producing optical instru-ments are distinct from those involved in lens working and will&apos; require much leas fostering than is necessitated in the glass making and working branches of the traderHosiery Latch Heedies *The Hosiery Industry of the United Kingdom was dependent before the War for its supplies of latch needles upon Germany, from which country some 95fo of&quot; the needles used, including all the finer gauges, were imported.    The cutting off of these supplies placed
tj british hosiery makers in a position of groat difficulty, especially in carrying out the very large orders from the War Office.potash Compounds.   It is only by absolute prohibition that controT^n^be retained to an extent sufficient to prevent tho German Kale Syndicate from cutting&apos; prices to such a degree as to prouent the development of alternative sources of supply, and;the promising efforts at production in this country can be encouraged.Tungsten Powder, ?S E2^?SSS8* 3and^TungsT^lTTre/Touher than wire in lamp filaments contained in manuiacT/urect lampso)She Tungsten producing industry which has been developed during the war is capable of supplying far more &apos; Tungsten than the country can consume, moreover the product is somewhat better than used to be supplied by Germany.

The Rubber Tyre Industry has been restricted in scope and seriously retarded by the war;   it is exposed to very severe competition from great foreign concerns which have, not been adversely affected by the War, but have on the oon-trary been able to develop very largely and to accumulate great capital reserves.

O ftAppendix III -      3 oHUHililHi   II-  I  inlliii hi in&apos; Bit (MMMHMtKwMkl********** 11*THE IRON &amp; STEEL INDUSTRIBS b and steel in 1^13 the production of Pi3 Iron in the United Kingdom was 10 million tone; in Germany it was 19 million tons and in the United States 3.1 million tons.   The production of steel was 7.7 million tone in the United-Kingdom, in Germany 18,7 million tons and in the United States 31*3 million tons. Progress in the Iron and Steel Industry of Germany and the United States during the decads proceding the War had been both absolutely and relatively very much greater than that of the United Kingdom and fc&amp;e mbr-e specialised branches of British inaustry were becoming increasingly dependent uxwn imported material.   This position was due to a number of causes.The outpmt of native iron ore had been practically stationery in the United Kingdom while it had increased very rapidly in the United States and, Germany whose ore resources are far larger than those of Great Britain, whilst the general position of the industry here had not conduced to the energetic working of existing deposits or the search for new fields. American and german interests had obtained oontrol of extensive ore deposits outside their own countries whilst the British ironmaster as a rule imported ore in small lots, largely through merchants.Furthers the American and German Iron and Steel Industries&apos; were of relatively recent growth and had throughout been organised foi large scale product sn, small plants held and worked by individual owners were comparatively rare whereas there many in the United Kingdom.    The German and  American manufacturers had aimed throughout at the production in particular works of large quantities of uniform commodities rather than at variety of output and had, laid down large units specially designed for cheap production, whilst not on&amp;y was the specialisation of works much less marked in the United Kingdom but extension here has generally taken the form of the remodelling and extension of &quot;existing works.   Moreover the efficiency of the iron and steel plants of Great Britain was very much below that of thair competitors in the United States and Germany. TH j was the result of a number of factors but primarily of the smaller scale of production.   Finally distribution in the United Kingdom was largely unorganised, the numerous trade associa tions existing dealing only with price regulation or labour questions, and no serious effort had been-made towards combined action in respect pf selling or the distribution of production so as as to reduce cost of production and distribution to a minimum.   Organisation of the industry in the United States had taken the form of powerful consolidations regulating prod- -uction and distribution; in Germany combination for selling purposes had exercised great influence on the organisation of production.
During the war ermw$&amp;c action for the promotion of production was taken by the Ministry&quot;oof Munitions and a large number of extensions c   iron and steel works were arranged, particularly in the years 1916*18 under agreements whereby firms ( undertook to do the work under the supervision and with the financial aid of the Ministry - the main principle being t* leave the firms at the end of the War with modern plant at approximately pre-war cost.   The general conditions delayed the completion of these programmes but nevertheless the extensions and the improvements introduced both in plant and r^schinery mark a great development in the steel-making industry of the country but it is important to observe that the extensions to stefrl works have cut-stripped those to blast furnaces end the &quot;basic steel-making capacity of the country is very considerably in advance of itc fcasic pig iron capacity and this is a serious source cf weakness.   The Iron and Steel Trades Committee appointed by the Board of Trade have reported that there are three direction in which action must be taken if the Iron and Steel Industry of Great Britain is to be raised to a level of productiveness and efficiency which will bear comparison with those of the United States and Germany.   These are:-(1) There should he an organisation co-operative in character among British Iron-masters for the purpose of obtaining adequate supplies of suitable iron ore, both from abroad end by the development of native supplies;(2) The formations of eellingfcrganisat ions to market British iron and steel products in the most economical and efficient manner;(3) The laying down of large and well designed new plant for cheap production upon modern lines. This will involve , haavy capital expenditure which is only possible by the consolidation of interests and with Government financial support.Action upon these lines clearly entails the recognition of the principle of combination for production and distribution and Government financial participation in the industry, and both of these would clearly only be justifysbie and could only be made acceptable i&amp; public Opinion if they carried with them such Government supervision as would guard against any abuse of power by the combinations and arrangements to give the Government an effective voice in the reorganisation and direction of the industry.   On the other hand to secure active co-operation of the Industry itself it appears very desirable that Government financial participation should take the form of sharing in the riek end not merely of advances up^n security.
jiStandardisati on  Proposals.There is growing recognition of the importance for the future&apos;of British Industry, of the principle&quot;end practice of Stanaardisati^a, including .(A) The fixation and maintenance of Standards of measurements*(B) The authoritative determination in respoct of materials and plant of the most suitable standards, of quality and perftteanoe.(0) The establishment of uniformity of specification by the a&amp;pption so-far as practicable of the Standards thus authoritatively determined and the consequential Standardisation and economy of production.(D) The establishment of an efficient system of testing.While the aspects included above under (A) are a matter far the State and have been entrusted in this Country to the Board of Trade, the aspects included under (B) (C) end (D) have been regarded mainly as of private concern, and the State has done little to help, except insofar as it has given financial assist-ance to the Work of the Engineering Standards Association.   They are also however of great importance from the national point of view since they are bound up with industrial efficiency and the promotion of the exports trade.    With regard to&apos;testing, it is obviously most desirable that buyers should be in a position to assure themselves not only that goods purchased by them purport to comply with the standards for which they lave specified, but that they do in fact so comply, and on the other hand it is often advantageous to manufacturers themselves to be able to,, pro duos evidence to that effect.    It is obvious that to command confidence at home and abroad such testing must be carried out by responsi-ble institutions or private concerns ef standing and repute.   If standardisation is to be extended to branches of production other ., than those to $which it is at present effectively applied, testing ixust be done by institutions recognised by the Government to be so constituted and equipped as to provide for impartial and efficient discharge of the duties undertaken, and of which the marks would oonsequently have the Government imprimatur.    The matter is of special moment in connection with&quot;&quot;a -Scheme which has been put forward by the interests concerned for the establishment of a National Electrical Proving House.    It is also important in -connection with the testing of chemical glass and gauges which has been carried on during the war on a large scale at the national Physical Laboratory.The Board of Trade are satisfied that there is need for Government action to secure co-ordination and to encourage these various movements and their extensions, and consider it desirable that a Department of Standards should be set up whose functions should be:-(1)   To promote and co-ordinate Standardisationgenerally and for this purpose to cooperate with and assist financially.
if necessary such bodies as the Engineering Standards Association: and

(II) To establish and administer such Testing institutions as may be found necessary and/or to authorise and so far as may be required supervise the testing work carried out by Technical Institutions, Trade Organisations or private concerns. (The  Government Testing institutions should be self sustained, at least after the early stages, deriving their revenue from fees).

The Department of Standards might be organised on lines adopted with marked success by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, that is with an executive Officer assisted by a Permanent Staff and with an Advisory Committee and assessors representing such Government Departments as may be concerned.  The committee would appoint such sub-Committees as might prove expedient for further branches of work, the Sub-Committees ? of persons so-opted because of their special qualifications in each case.
Familiar illustrations of the lack of independence in respect of raw materials are furnished by Flax, for which the Linen Industry, not only of the United lingaom but of the World generally, was very largely dependent upon Russia, with consequent serious difficulties during the war - difficulties which may continue for same time to come;   end Cotton, in respect of which the United Kingdom, though well place-37In&quot;regard to the finer graces (Egypt) and the lower grades (India), is dependent for the grades which constitute the bulk of the World&quot;s supply upon the United States, w&amp;ose production is being increasingly called upon for domestic consumption and is also very fluctuating. Other examples of the same class are Potash, of great importance as the raw material for the manuf sotuz-e&quot;of&quot;fertilisers and for certain/tkdustrial purposes, for which this country, and indeed the whole world, was dependent almost entirely upon Germany; Barytes, which is used for the manufacture of white paints. pTgmQnfs, lithopone etc, and was imported very largely from Germany;   and Platinum of Importance for a number of industrial purposes and particularly for certain branches of chemical production, and of which tho world1s supplies wore obtained almost entirely from Russia.A policy of industrial, security should clearly aim at developing, so far as possible;, the supply of these and other raw materials of industry from&apos;sources under British control; efforts in this direction Lave already been made and should be continuedo    Examples of this kind of action are the work done during the war by the Flax Control Board in reepeot of IIax Seed production in Canada and the extension and improvement of Flax-growing in Ireland, and by the Board of Agriculture in respe ot of flax-growling * in Great Britain:   and the investigations now being carried on by the Empire $lax Growing Committee, established by the Board of Trade.    As regards Cotton, Government assistanos has already been given to the British Cotton.Growing Association and for the development of cotton growing in the Sudan,, and the further steps necessary to promote cotton growing within the Empire are being considered by the Empire Growing Committee established by the Board of Trade, on which the other Governm.en.ts of the Empire and of the cotton growing and using interests are representedi    As regards potash the Optical Munitions Glassware and potash production Department of the Ministry of Munitions has devoted considerable effort to establishing home production.As regards Minerals, the Imperial Mineral Resources Bureau, representative of all the Governments of&quot; the Empire, has been&apos; established to secure the systematic collection of information as to the Empire1s resources and the development of surveys on a comprehensive plan.**1C-STATE CO-OPERATION WITH INDUSTRIES TO ENSURE THE PHOVISIOJJ OF k RAW MATERIALS &amp; FOSTER IMPERIAL SUPPLIES.
