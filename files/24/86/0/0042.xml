(THIS DOQUMT IS THE PROPERTY 0? HIS BBITMIUO MAJESTY13 SOVEBKMEHI) SECRET &amp; POIIHOTTIAL.G/ft7940* W A R    0 A B I H B I. *FLAX QR077IUS XJHf IREXAflB. Memorandum by the Chief 3eorstary for Ireland.I desire to support the proposals of the President of tho Board of Trade (G,T.7812) for the establishment of flax growing in the South of Ireland.The distribution of the flax crop before and during tho war is shown by tho following figures:-1914 1918,Acres- Acres.Ulster 48,747 135,219Rest of Ireland 506 8,136Great Britain 629 19,742ffew artiolos were more essential to the successful prosecution of the war than flax.     The above figures show what Ireland did to supply it.    The importance of the drop now is to ensure home-grown fibro for the linen mills instead of relying too muoh, as in the past, on foreign supplies.   Prior to the r&apos;ar the Irish crop barely supplied one-fourth of tho fibre required by the Irish spinnors.The climate and soil of tho South of Ireland are quite suitable to   flax growing.   Laox of facilities for extracting the fibre on the spot limited tho area 6rown there in 1918. For want of those facilities tho orop had to ba railed to Ulster to bo treated.   This was not only costly but added to the railway congestion.    To develop and increase flax growing in the South, facilities must be provided thero to extract the fibre.Tho production of       flax in Ireland was jeopardised during the war by the fact that in pre-war time tho seed was imported - mainly from Russia and Holland.     Imports from Russia ware out off during the war, while Holland was forced to produoo food rather than flax seed.   Sood for tho Irish crop had to be brought from Japan, and specially cultivatod in Canada to meet Irish needs.     In addition, to-meet the seed difficulty, Irish farmers were compelled by tho-Irish Dopartmont of Agricul-ture to save the seed from one-eighth of their crop.The old system of treating the flax crop as practised in the North of Ireland does not lend itsolf to seed saving. Moreover, change of seed, i.o. tho use of seed grown in a different soil and climate, is desirable.     Seed raised in . the South of Ireland does well when sown in the North. Aooordiflg-ly, it is desirable to start in the South of Ireland an improved system of flax culture - one under which sood as woll as fibre can be produced.This involves the cost of providing factories;   and, as seed saving necessitates tho holding of the crop for tho greater&apos;part of the. year, a large working capital or bank loan is necessary.(Initialled)IRISH 034PIQ3, 8th August, 1919.
