1548a/330/W/7.-   2 ?FEDERATION  OP BRITISH  INDUSTRIES.  &apos;The Control of Industry.REPORT OF THE NATIONALISATION COMMITTEE.INTRODUCTION.Before we attempt to deal with the important issues which will be discussed in this Report, we desire to set out a few facts regarding the con-ditioris under which the industry of the world is at present carried on.Development of the Industrial System.  .At the present time the capitalist system is the basis of the whole of the productive enterprise of the civilised world.At the beginning of the 19th century the population of England and Wales did not much exceed 8 millions, and its standard of living was low. By the end of the century the population was nearly quadrupled, having reached a very much greater number than can possibly be sup-ported from the internal resources of the country, and yet the standard of living of all classes of the community had been considerably raised. The great increase of production which made this possible was entirely achieved under the capitalist &apos; system.Production cannot take place except through the previous accumulation of wealth by the efforts and savings of individuals, and the capitalist system has provided the best machinery hitherto discovered for enabling and encouraging the individual to accumulate, wealth and devote it to production.It has preserved the fluidity which is needed to,ensure progress and to encourage the re-adapta-tion continually necessitated by changing con-ditions and new inventions and discoveries, while providing unequalled means of encouraging those engaged in production to ascertain and fulfil the requirements of the individual consumer.The needs of a civilised population are so varied and its demands change so rapidly that a considerable risk is involved in all productive undertakings.The capitalist system has offered the maximum inducement to every citizen to take part in the great adventure of productive enterprise, which has maintained the world and made civilisationpossible. At the same time the risk of personal loss involved has tended to- restrain reckless and uneconomical production.The above considerations apply with redoubled force to the export trade, in which the risks are greater and the requirements of the consumer more varied and more difficult to ascertain than in the home trade. The population of this country could not have existed and cannot con-tinue to exist without a large export of manu-factured goods to pay for the raw materials and foodstuffs which must be imported for its subsistence-tence. The capitalist system has afforded ideal means for developing our Export Trade.Growth of Competition.In many cases the rapid increase of production led to the growth of an intense competition, involving destructive undercutting of prices and unnecessary duplication of activity and plant.The elasticity of the capitalist system enabled it to adapt itself automatically to the changing conditions, by the development of large indus-trial combinations, thus decreasing unnecessary and wasteful competition, and securing to- the world the economies of large-scale production.Development of Combinations.This development is a normal and necessary feature of the industrial evolution consequent upon the use of power-driven machinery. More-over we believe that the development has been of definite benefit to the consumer by standardising and steadying production and reducing costs.The Addendum to the Report of the Govem-ment Committee on Trusts (Cd. 9236) which was signed by Messrs. Ernest Bevin, J. A. Hobson, W. H. Watkins, and Sidney Webb contains the following statement: &quot; We have to recognise &quot; that association and combination in production &apos;&apos; and distribution are steps in the greater &quot; efficiency, the increased economy and the &quot; better organisation of industry. We regard &apos;&apos; this evolution as inevitable and desirable.
Moreover the commercial competition of other nations becomes every year more and more intense. This makes the principle of combination absolutely essential if British Industry is to hold its own at home and abroad.If, therefore, the present industrial system is to reach its full efficiency as a means of satisfying the requirements of the community, the evolu-&apos; tion towards large-scale organisation must be encouraged and not discouraged. At the same time it must be remembered that the adminis-tration of large centralised concerns is still in an experimental stage&apos;, and only experience can discover how best to eliminate the inherent difficulties. Meanwhile the development of com-binations of capital is undoubtedly responsible for some of the present unrest in the industrial world, for the following masons:  Relations between Producer and Consumer.The growth of monopolistic combinations has disquieted, and occasionally led to the exploita-tion of the consumer, though this latter feature has, almost certainly, been greatly exaggerated. In this connection we would refer to the. following statement by Dr. J. W. Jenks, the well-known authority who has been entrusted by the Govern-ment of the United States with the drafting of anti-trust legislation: &quot;Contrary to public opinion, a careful study of the charts indicates that the effect of these combinations taking their history as a whole has not been to increase prices to the consumers, though at certain times and for relatively short periods they have doubtless increased prices.&quot; (The Trust Problem, chapter IX.)relations between Capital and Labour.The aggregation of capital into large units has led to the separation of the owner of capital from the workers he employs. Formerly the owner of capital generally took an active part in the direction of his business. The business was on a small scale, and he was directly in con-tact with his workers. Now the owners of capital in any large concern may be hundreds oi thousands, and the size of the unit is such that management must be by deputies sub-divided into various grades, and little if any personal con tact can exist between the owners of capital and the men employed.Waste of National Eesourges.Another disadvantage which has arisen fromthe rapid development of industry has beenthe great waste caused in some of the world&apos;s essential resources.The need for some adequate safe-guarding of the interests of the community in the future becomes evident, when we consider the reckless using up of the future resources of the world, such as has been manifest, for example, in the United States of America. &quot;The voluminous Eeport of the American National Conservation Commission in 1909 gives the facts in striking detail. We read there the story of &quot; the robbing of the soil &quot; by the prairie farmer, the destruction of the forest by the &quot;lumber kings,&quot; the reckless exhaustion of the oil fields, the frittering away of the potential water power, the neglect of irrigation-tion, the loss of wealth by coast-erosion and river inundation showing in the aggregate a vast economic waste.THE DEMANDS OF LABOUR.The remedies which the Labour and Socialist Parties suggest for the difficulties which have been referred to above are:  1. Nationalisation.(a) To prevent the possible exploitation of the consumer by the monopolies which may result from the centralisation necessary to the efficiency of certain industries and public services.(b) To&apos; supervise and co-ordinate the develop-ment of essential national resources.2. Democratic Control by the Workers.To prevent the alleged exploitation of Labour by Capital, both in regard to (a) Conditions of employment.(b) Division of the rewards of industry.I-NATIONALISATION.The word nationalisation is used loosely to cover a great many forms of communistic enter-prise, e.g., state ownership, state ownership com-bined with state management, municipal enterprise, etc. These various forms all raise different considerations which cannot be discussed in detail in a report of this character. We pro-pose therefore to&apos; set out our views by means&apos; of a number of general statements.State Management.We would begin by laying it down as a general proposition that centralised management by a Government Department is fatal to commercial efficiency and enterprise. We observe that those members of the Government Committee on Trusts who signed the Addendum to the Keport of the Committee (Messrs. E. Bevin, J. A. Hobson, W. H. Watkins, and Sidney Webb) were careful to safeguard themselves by stating that State ownership does not necessarily imply State
2? 7hi I v ifmanagement, while Mr. Justice Sankey in his Beport on the Second Stage of the Coal Industry Commission stated (see para, xlii.) that &quot;Hitherto State management has on balance failed to prove itself free from serious short-comings.&quot; The Hon. F. M. B. Fisher, who as Minister of Trade and Customs in the Govern-ment of New Zealand (1912-1915) has- had practical experience of Socialistic Government, made the following remarks in his evidence before the Coal Commission:  &quot;I hold the view that State monopoly is even a worse evil than private monopoly the latter must be efficient in order to resist private competition on the one hand, and prevent the demand for State intervention on the other.   The State has no such grounds for efficiency.&quot;Sir Keith Price, Director of the Eaw Materials Section, of the Ministry of Munitions in 1915 and Deputy Director-General 1916 to 1917, in his evidence gave a full summary of the objections to bureaucratic management, as follows:  &quot;My experience of those Government Factories which were in existence previous to the war confirms me in the opinion that Government factories cannot be operated on competitive or economic lines, owing to the cumbersome nature of the procedure, which is inevit-able under Parliamentary and Departmental control.&quot;Among the objections against Government control to which I attach importance are the following:  &quot;1. The Management having so little say in :(a) The appointment and selection of staff;(b) The grading of salaries;(c) The lack of authority in dealing with labour;(d) The efficient maintenance of plant, i.e., the scrapping of obsolete plant and the instal-lation of up-to-date plant.&quot;2. The weakness of anyGovernmeut Organization in purchasing the raw material on competitive lines (a condition which did not operate during the war owing to so many prices being controlled and material being rationed).&quot;3. The weakness of any Government organiza-tion marketing its products. I cannot see how this can be done satisfactorily on commercial lines without acute controversy.&quot;4. Political pressure will certainly be brought to bear whenever questions of closing down inefficient or uneconomical concerns arise, or even on lesser subjects.&quot;We would add that all these difficulties appear to us to be intensified under a democratic form of Government, and in confirmation of this it may be observed that the bureaucracy of Germany under the Imperial system, which involved subjection to the Imperial Executive and freedom from Parliamentary control, came nearest to achieving an efficiency comparable with that of private enterprise. It would, therefore, seem almost inevitable that if a nationalised industry is to achieve any high degree of efficiency it should be developed under a systemof autocratic control, and the greater the extent to which the industries of the country are nationalised, the greater the danger that the Government will tend away from those ideals&apos; of true democracy which have only just triumphed at the cost of so much suffering.Manufacturing Industries.These inherent weaknesses of State manage-ment account for the fact that, while the State has at different times and in different countries undertaken a wide range of those important enterprises which aim at rendering a service open to the whole community, and has, to some extent, engaged in manufacture for its own consumption, it has not, speaking generally, engaged in industries aiming primarily at the production of goods for exchange. This is the most difficult class of productive enterprise, needing, if it is to be successful, the most elastic and far-sighted management, a close and continual study of individual requirements, and constant re-adapta-tion to meet changing conditions of demand.The State is obviously unsuited for enterprise of this kind, and it is not surprising that, although State monopolies have been established in certain products for purposes of revenue, the results have in general been most unfortunate for the consumer.The same can be said of municipal enterprise; this has never engaged to any substantial extent in the production of goods for exchange.It is, in fact, impossible for this class of pro-duction to be satisfactorily carried out unless the producer is subject at the same time to the spur of possible profit and the curb of possible personal loss. The civil servant or municipal employee should be immune from the temptation of personal profit, while the body which employs him (the State or Municipality), having the public purse behind it, is liable to fluctuate between over-caution and extreme recklessness.It is further inconceivable that an industry owned or managed by the State could enter into competitive trade in foreign countries in the present stage of human development, without encountering difficulties both economic and political, which would be disastrous to any hope of amicable international relations. Every trade dispute would become a potential casus belli, every unpaid account or broken contract the subject of an ultimatum.And yet, as we have already pointed out, a great and increasing export trade is an essential of continued existence to a highly industrialized country such as Great Britain, dependent for a large proportion of her essential foodstuffs and raw
materials upon, her imports, and compelled to&apos; pay for them by the. export of manufactured commodities,Public Service Industries.Where there is no question of meeting the vary-&apos; ing requirements of individual consumers, but only of supplying some public service open to the whole community, different considerations arise. As is well known, a substantial proportion of the essential public services, such as Transport, Supply of Water and Lighting, Drainage, etc., in many civilised countries, is in the hands of the State or Municipality. The Nationalisation or Municipalisation of these services has been accelerated by the fact that these forms of enter-prise can be run more or less by routine&apos; methods and are conducted on the principle of increasing returns, that is to say, in the words of J. S. Mill, &quot; can only be carried out advantageously upon so large a scale. as to render liberty of competition illusory.&quot; These services fall into different categories, which require separate consideration. Our views in regard to them are summarised in the following propositions.1. There are certain public services, such as the provision of Roads and Sewers, which must be handled by the State or Municipality, because ii is either impossible or undesirable to make a direct charge for them.2. There are certain public services which involve the exercise of exceptional and arbitrary powers over individual or public property and can more efficiently be conducted as monopolies. Considerations of public policy often make it desirable that where these are of purely local importance they should be conducted by&apos; the Municipality.3. - In some cases successful results have been obtained by vesting important public service organisations in special Commissions or bodies 0&apos;f Trustees nominated by the chief users and the appropriate Public Authorities. .4. There are certain Public Services, the activities of which must be co-ordinated over large areas if they are to obtain real efficiency. We suggest that the most effective way of obtain-ing this co-ordination will generally be to facilitate the amalgamation or co-operative working of the different undertakings in each area, subject to the safeguards necessary for the protection of the Public.Conclusion.Finally, we desire to record our emphatic opinion that in dealing with industries or public sendees of whatever class, whether local or national, any further extension of State mono-monopolies should be avoided not only for the reasons given above under the heading of &quot; State Management,&apos;&apos; but also because:  (a) The proper safeguard against private monopoly is not the creation of State mono-monopolies, which are much more dangerous. The intervention of the State should aim, not at removing, but at preserving so far as possible the advantages of competition.(b) There is very grave objection to the Government being the employer of a large proportion of the voters upon whose support it depends.(c) The principal aim of the State must always be political; governments are organ-ised for political and not for commercial purposes and must always be overloaded with political work which will be their chief concern. .(d) The existence of such monopolies makes it impossible for the Government to be impartial in industrial matters, and makes for political corruption.(e) It has hitherto been found impossible for the State to give sufficiently free play to local knowledge and experience in conn&amp;ction with the services which it administers, and over-centralisation is hostile to progress.(/) State administration is always found to involve serious delay in,the taking of deci-sions, even on matters of detail,&apos; and to be deficient in that elasticity which is essential to commercial success.(g) The fact that any deficiencies in work-ing can be met out of revenue is often an irresistible temptation to uneconomical working.(h) Owing to the close interdependence of our different industries, the taking over by the State of one Industry for what may be considered reasons of public policy may involve the State in the necessity of taking over other Industries, the Nationalisation of which would be a disaster to the community.RECOMMENDATIONS.(a) STATE REGULATION OF MONOPOLIES.But although we are averse to State Manage-ment, we recognise that the public is entitled to some protection against possible exploitation by monopolies. As we have already indicated, we think the danger of this exploitation has been greatly exaggerated, but the fear of it exists and industry should, therefore, submit to such inter-vention on behalf of the State as may be necessary
to remove the hostility to the idea of combination which undoubtedly affects certain sections of the public.In our opinion, the principles on which State action should be based are generally indicated in the Report of the Government Committee on Trusts, and we are prepared to support those recommendations of the Committee, which throw on the Board of Trade the duty (1) of enquiring into any reasonable complaints, which may be made with regard to the existence or action of any Trade Association or Combine and referring any question which may arise from their enquiry to a special tribunal for investigation and report, and (2) of recommending to the State action for the remedy of any grievances which the tribunal may find to be established.It will, however, be most important in carrying out any policy of this kind to safeguard the position of the Export Trade, and we regard it as&apos; essential:  (1) That no restriction should be placed on British Industry which will prejudice its position in the export trade.(2) That care should be taken not to publish or give extended circulation to any information regarding the activity of Trade Associations or Combines, which might be useful to their foreign competitors.(b) CONSERVATION OE NATIONAL RESOURCES. We are also of the opinion that the State should exercise the supervision and control necessary to -ensure that the national resources are not wasted, but are used to the best advantage of the com-munity; this should not involve the exploitation of such resources by the State, and need not involve State ownership, but only the amount of regulation necessary to prevent waste.Note. Co-Operative Societies. ^Before leaving this branch of our suffject, we desire to mention one other form of enterprise which has done excellent work for , the community, and should have consider-able development in the future, though it can never cover more than a small part of the whole field of production. We refer to the work of the Co-operative Societies. These Societies are Associations of con-sumers who- unite voluntarily with the idea primarily of supplying their own require-ments. They buy the greater part of their supplies in the ordinary markets, and to. that extent their work is distributive only. But they have established factories  and work-shops for making shoes, clothing, hardware, biscuits, etc., for their own consumption. In this they have been fairly successful and their success is due largely to the&apos; fact that they have an assured market and confine themselves to mating staple goods by standard methods.2.-DEMOCRATIC CONTROL.Scope of the Demand of Labour.According to a writer in the Round Table for June, 1916, &quot;The unrest in the industrial world to-day has not its roots solely in poverty and want. There is something deeper still at work. Wage earners are filled with a. vague but pro-found sentiment that the industrial system, as it now is, denies them the liberties, opportunities and responsibility of free men.&quot;This feeling of unrest, which is naturally more characteristic of the intellectual section of Labour than of the rank and file of the workers, has given rise to the demand, which the proceedings of the Coal Commission have brought into prominence, for &apos;&apos; Democratic Control.The scope of the demands of Labour under this head ranges from a share in the control of working conditions to the taking over of the whole function of the employer. Speaking generally the advocates of &quot; Democratic Control&quot; ignore nationalisation and aim at placing the control of Industry to. a greater or less degree in the hands of the workers, thereby admitting what is undoubtedly the fact, that neither Nationali-sation nor Municipalisation will substantially affect their position. The Manual Labourer when working for the State, the Municipality, or the Co-operative Society is still a wage-earner and subject to discipline, and the relations between employers and employed are marked by the same characteristics as under ordinary capitalistic employment.Mr. Gqsling&apos;s Suggestions. As an example of the more moderate demand,we have the suggestions put forward by Mr.Gosling in his Presidential Address to the TradeUnion Congress, 1916:  &quot;Would it not. be possible for the employers of this country .... to agree to put their businesses on a new footing by admitting the work-men to some participation not in profits, but in control? We workmen do not ask that we should be admitted to any share in what is essentially the employers&apos; own business-that is in those matters which do not concern us directly in the industry or employ-ment in which we may be engaged. We do not seek to sit on the Board of Directors, or to interfere with the buying of materials or with the selling of the product. But in the daily management of the employment in which we spend our working lives, in the atmosphere
and under the conditions in which we have to work, in the hours of beginning and ending work, in tho cou-ditions of remuneration and even in tho manners and practices of the foremen with whom wo have to be in contact, in all these matters we feel that we, as work-men, have a right to a voice even to an equal voice  with the management itself. Believe me, we shall never get any lasting industrial peace except on the lines of democracy.&quot;But them has long existed a school of economic thought whose demands go much further than this. The elusive idea of a form of organisation, in which the workers would have complete con-trol of their lives and work, has given rise in the past to numerous experiments in &quot; Self-governing Workshops.&apos;&apos; The same aspiration in a different&apos; form, applicable to&apos; modern large-scale industries, emerges to-day in the proposals of the Syndicalists and the Guild Socialists.Syndicalism.Syndicalists aim at the ownership of the means of production by organised Labour, without any intervention by the State. They are radically opposed to Socialism, holding that the State, is the great enemy, and that collective ownership by the State&apos; would make the lot of the workers much&apos; worse than it is now under the private employer.Guild Socialism.Guild Socialists on the other hand hold that &apos;&apos; the&apos; State should own the means of production as trustees for the community; the Guild would manage them, also as trustees for the com-munity.&quot; They hope to be able to include in their Guild both the manual workers and the brain workers in the industry. The view of Guild Socialists is that State Socialism takes account of men only as consumers, while Syndicalists take account of them only as producers. -The essence, however, both of Guild Socialism and Syndicalism, is to change the control of Industry &quot;from above&quot; into control &quot;from below.&quot; Both schools realise that State Socialism will not do anything to improve the status of the manual workers.Past Experiments in Co-operative Production.The history of past experiments in Co-operative &apos; Production (whether of workers actually owning the shop&apos; and plant or of men working co-operatively under contract with the owner of the plant) shows that any policy of this kind must be fatal to our national efficiency.Associations of workers, which have been formed for the purpose of carrying on Production, have found themselves unable to cope with industries conducted on a large-scale, and in small-scale industries they have failed to make headwayagainst, or even keep pace with, the capitalist system. In no countey has any but the smallest fraction of industry fallen into their hands.The following are the more obvious defects&apos; of nearly all attempts at Co-operative Production:  1. The difficulty of securing discipline and efficient management when the manager is him-self subject to those whom he has to direct.2. Self-governing Workshops have all been noticeable more or less for the slowness and reluctance with which they have re-acted to1 any industrial change. The workers are biased in favour of the continuance of that to which their hands have become adapted. They are slow to introduce new processes, slow to adopt new inventions, slow, to instal machinery, slow in altering designs and patterns, and particularly slow to recognise the coming in of some alternative to their own commodity.3. Finally the gravest, and apparently the most insuperable, drawback to this form, of industrial organisation is that- the manual work-ing producers have no&apos; intimate oil accurate knowledge of the market for which they have to produce. They are not in direct contact with the consumer of their commodity. They do not recognise his desires or caprices; they are unable to foresee what he would prefer-hence, they are constantly finding themselves unable to dispose of their wares.Production for exchange cannot be successfully carried on unless the actual producer is under the direction of the commercial side.Mr. Sidney Webb, in a, draft.report prepared for the Committee of the Fabian Besearch Depart-ment in 1916, summarises the position as f ollows:  &quot; Attempts of Trade Unions to engage in industry have been uniformly and invariably financially unsuc-cessful, and no encouragement should be given to any Tjfcade Union to find any capital for industrial enter-pnses, whether under its own control or by self-governing workshops or what is usually styled co-operative production.&quot;And again:  &quot; The self-governing workshop has, however, proved by universal experience to be inapplicable to any industrial undertakings on a large scale, and therefore affords us no pjan of organization for the great mass of modern industry. Even in the industrial enterprise that can be carried on in a small way, the self-governing workshop^ where the workers enjoyed absolute autonomy, has proved by long and varied experience to&apos; be, in all but very exceptional cases, neither stable, nor, so long as it endures, economically efficient, and that where any commercial success has been attained, it will be found that it has been gained when there is a close market, nearly always a partially-tied market,, such as co-operative stores.&quot;
RECOMMENDATIONS.It is, however, impossible not to recognise that the theories of the Syndicalists and Guild Social-ists have arisen from a genuine grievance, which demands and should receive some remedy. That remedy, however, must not attempt to reverse the existing industrial order, or it will, as recent -events in Russia show, have disastrous effects upon our economic system, from which the workers themselves will be the chief sufferers.Social grievances such as poor housing, in-sufficient educational facilities, etc., are largely responsible for the idea of the class war, which &apos; is at the bottom of much industrial unrest. These are matters of primary importance, but the responsibility for the evils which undoubtedly exist rests upon the community as a whole, not solely upon employers, and the remedy for them must be in the main political. Much, however, could be done by improvements in industrial practice (particularly on tire part of the Trade Unions), to give increasing opportunities for the advancement of merit and so to a great extent remove the artificial boundary between the classes. Quite apart from restrictions on output the atmosphere of Trade Unionism has tended to discourage emulation amongst the workers, and to prevent the able and industrious worker from obtaining the position due to his abilities.Putting these considerations aside, the diffi-culties can, we submit, be reduced to a fairly narrow compass, and ought not to be incapable of adjustment, although it is impossible to put forward remedies which will be universally applicable, owing to the very great complexity and diversity of modern industry, in regard to such matters as the size and methods of organisation of the different firms and trades; the difficulties of the relations and organisation of Trade Unions; the ratio and relations of skilled and unskilled labour; the variations which obtain in the propor-tion of capital employed to Labour costs; the degree to which the works can be carried on by routine methods, etc.It must be remembered that industry is a living organism, which is undergoing a process of continuous development and growth. &quot;We believe that all attempts to impose pre-conceived schemes, of organisation can only result in hindering progress and may lead to disaster.This applies especially to those artificial schemes of reconstruction which find advocates among the extreme sections of Labour in the different countries of the world at the present time. We are convinced that the industrial system, of the future can only be built up on the foundation of present and past experience.With these considerations in mind we proceed to consider possible developments under the two following heads: &quot;Participation in Manage-ment &quot; and &quot;Participation in Profits.&quot;(a) PARTICIPATION IN MANAGEMENT. Conditions of Employment.We are strongly of opinion that the workers in every industry should be given the fullest possible voice in the determination of the conditions under which they are employed, provided this does not encroach upon the operations of the Commercial Management or lessen the proper authority of the foreman. Subject to these qualifications we endorse most willingly the suggestions put forward by Mr. Gosling in his Pi&apos;esidentia.1 Address already quoted.Whitley Councils.Generally speaking, we think that the objects which we have in view can best be obtained by carrying out, witli all possible speed, the reeom-mendations of the Whitley Eeport in regard to-National and District Industrial Councils, where the conditions of the trade permit. These recommendations have repeatedly been approved by the Federation and we desire on&apos;ce more to state in emphatic terms our approval of them, and especially of the proposals for District. Councils.The recommendations of .the Whitley Com-mittee, if properly carried out, will give the worker a new and honourable status. In the National Council of the Industry and in the Joint Industrial Council (the formation of which should result from the recent National Conference of Employers and Trade Unionists) his representa-tives will sit on an absolute equality with the employers, and will have an equal voice in determining the general conditions subject to which the Industry will be carried on.The carrying out of these conditions will be a moral obligation on the Commercial Management no less than on the Workers in the individual firms.But the success of these Councils must depend on the loyal acceptance of their decisions by both sides. We understand that some of the Councils are already applying for legislation to give legal validity to their decisions. It is obvious that the general adoption&apos; of this course would greatly increase the effectiveness of the scheme, Commercial Management.We have carefully considered the question how far the workers can be given any share in the Commercial Management of the business employing them, but we are convinced that it is undesirable and impracticable to attempt this.
The history of tho various experiments on the line of the &apos;&apos; Self-governing Workshop &apos;&apos; shows that any attempt of this kind would inevitably throw Industry into confusion and weaken the pro-ductive force of the nation.The workers are legitimately interested in the general conditions governing the industry in which they work, so far as the industry as a whole is concerned, and should be given the fullest possible voice^ in the settlement of general condi-tions, but the Commercial Management must be kept as a separate department which should be open to any person possessing the requisite qualifications, but which must not be under the control of the . manual workers. For these reasons we agree with Mr. Gosling that no solution can be found by offering the workers representation on the directorate. We have heard of certain large, firms who have adopted or are thinking of adopting this plan, but we feel it impossible to make a general recommendation in favour of such a practice. Publicity in Regard to Trade Statistics.We regard it, however, as of the utmost im-portance that the workers should be given a better insight into the Industry which employs them. We consider that they should have a greater interest in their work and a clearer under-standing of the financial condition of their industry as a whole and of the difficulties involved in the management and in the obtaining of markets.It is difficult to suggest any definite arrange-ment which will be generally applicable to all industries, but we believe that the declared objects of several of the National Industrial Councils which have been formed include pro-visions for the supply to the workers of properly certified aggregate statistics for the industry in regard to wages, manufacturing and selling prices, average percentages of profits on turnover, and materials, costs, etc. Works Committees.We believe also that, in Industries where circumstances admit of their formation, Works Committees will do much to make the worker realise that he is acquiring a new status in Industry. The institution of these Committees should be encouraged in every possible way, subject to the qualification that they should in general be representative of the workers only, and should be regarded rather as a channel through which the workers can make such recom-mendations as they desire to the Works Management.Within these limits they should be given the highest possible status.(6) PARTICIPATION IN PROFITS.Before proceeding to deal with this part of our subject in detail we desire to call attention to the analysis of the national income before the war, made by Professor Bowley, one of the outstanding, statistical authorities in this country, in his book entitled &quot; The Division of the Product of Industry,&quot; published 1919. This analysis shows that &quot; before the war the wealth of the country however divided was insufficient for a general high standard; and there is nothing yet to show that it will be greater in the future.&quot;Professor Bowley concludes that:  &quot; The most important task,-more important immedi-ately than the improvement of the division of the product incumbent on employers and workmen alike, is to increase the national product and that without sacrificing leisure and the amenities of life.&quot;&quot; The problem of securing wages which people rather optimistically believe to be immediately and perman-ently possible, is to a great extent independent of the question of national or individual ownership, unless, it is seriously believed that production would increase greatly if the State were the sole employer.&quot;It would seem to follow from these conclusions that any proposals for increasing the remuneration of the workers should be framed in such a way as lo give the greatest possible incentive to increase the national production.Proposals of this kind may be classified under three headings &quot; Profiit Sharing,&quot; &quot;Pooling of Profits &quot; and &quot; Payment by Results.&quot;Profit Sharing.We are unable to make a general recommenda-tion in support of any system of profit sharing for the following reasons:  (a) So far as we can ascertain profit-sharing is not desired by the workers, who are chiefly interested in securing high and regular wages and not in obtaining what they regard as occasional windfalls.(b) Profits are not the correct basis for cal-speculation of wages, because the remuneration of the workers ought, not to be made dependent on the successes or failures of thei commercial management.(&apos;c) The general introduction of profit-sharing would lead to great inequalities between the position of workers in different works and industries, and this would give rise to a sense of dissatisfaction and injustice.(d) The schemes, of profit-sharing at present in existence only give a very small addition to&apos; the earnings of the workpeople, and this must always be the case except where the capital engaged in an industry bears a high proportion to the number of workers employed.
2*) 9- The above&apos; criticisms do not, however, apply to the contributions by employers, either individu-ally or through their trade associations, to thrift, superannuation, accident, sickness or unemploy-ment funds. Where a policy of this kind can be adopted it will do much to remove the feeling of insecurity and the fear of sickness and old age which are a large factor in industrial discontent.Pooling op Profits.We have considered the suggestion that some system might be devised whereby after capital had received a certain return, and the necessary allowance for depreciation and repairs had been made, a part of the profits should b&apos;e set aside for distribution among the workers.Schemes of this kind may be employed succes-fully in some industries, but they are open to the general criticism which has been made above in regard to&apos; profit-sharing, and it would be impos-sible to devise a scheme which would be universally applicable. We are therefore unable to make any definite recommendation on the subject.Payment by Results.We consider it desirable, however, that, where possible, the remuneration of the workers should be made to bear some proportion to the efficiency -of their own efforts, so that good and regular work may be adequately rewarded without considera-tion of the rate of profit arising from the com-mercial management of the business. We regard this as a matter of very great importance, and we desire to record the strongest possible warning in regard to the injury which will be inflicted on the productive forces of this country, if the agitation against the principle of payment by results, now being carried on amongst certain sections of labour, proves successful.At the same time we realise that the workers have some excuse for their attitude in view of the fact that in some cases individual employers have unjustly cut piece rates, when the activities of the workers have resulted in their remuneration being largely increased.If the system of payment by results is to become general, it is essential that employers should establish equitable systems for fixing piece rates, and that there should be some reasonable procedure for the sanctioning by an impartial authority of *any adjustment which may prove necessary.THE STATE AND INDUSTRY.In our recommendations regarding the relations between Capital and Labour, no mention has been made of the functions of the State. Generally speaking we believe that neither employers nor employed desire the intervention of the State to settle their difficulties, except as an impartial arbitrator. The principles of trade union repre-sentation and collective bargaining are now fully accepted by employers. We hope that both sides will show themselves increasingly ready to yield to the influence of public opinion, and this tendency will, we believe, grow as the establishment of Joint Councils gives greater opportunity for the friendly discussion of difficulties and greater and wider appreciation of the economic con-ditions under which industry is carried on. Nor, as we have already pointed out, would the position of the worker be substantially altered under State or Municipal ownership. He would remain a wage earner, as he is under private enterprise. Any concession which could safely be given to the worker by a Governmental or Municipal employer can and should be given by the private employer. We have already indicated what we consider those concessions might be.The function of the State in relation to Industry should be confined to laying down minimum conditions for employment and safeguarding the public, e.g., from the dangers due to the develop-ment of monopolistic combinations, whether, of Capital or Labour. For the power of monopoly is not confined to organisations of capital. The Trade Union which endeavours to&apos; exploit the com-munity by withholding its labour is acting as much in restraint of trade and should be subject to the same State control as the Combine which endeavours to exploit the consumer by means of a monopoly of its products.
