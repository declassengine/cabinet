His Britannic IV)a jesty&apos;3 Govonima lit(P 4697) . From Viceroy, 7th August 1919.(Received 11 tli, 10.45 aim.)11144G T.S.   Secret.   Afghanistan.   Following from Baluchistan, Glh August:.  &quot; I returned evening of 5th August from week&apos;s tour to Loralai and Kila Saitulla.   I interviewed all leading Sardars and Malicks of both places, and was escorted by them on my journey.   Tribal situation appeared to me on the spot immensely better than would appear from numerous reports of raids.   Disaster to convoy at Kapip, and presence of Wazir round Fort Samleman has had curiously little effect on Zhob Valley west of Musafir Poresh, and whole valley from  liindubagb. to Musafir Poresh is almost normal, revenue being assessed and collected and orders of Fianis obeyed.   Everyone assures me /that if military post could be established at Mina Bazar or neighbourhood Abdullazais and other tribesmen would settle.clown. It is now fully confirmed that operations at Hindu Bagh were directed by so-called Brigadier Musa Khan Muhammadzai, late Governor of Mukivr, who was accompanied by some 30 (corrupt group) and 500 Tarakki Ghilzais mixed with few Zob Militia deserters and refugees.   Afghan Qazi came from Kila Rashid to Murgha Fakirzai few day ago and distributed two mule-loads of ammunition, but said this was not the official act ( ? by orders) of Amir, who would repudiate his action.   Qazi also took thumb-marks of leaders of lashkar on written order that they should not enter British territory, but hinted that they were not expected to obey.   Later orders, however, arrived requiring Afghans imperatively return to frontier on grounds that there was genuine prospect of peace, and this order was reluctantly obeyed on night of 2nd August.   This retirement has momentarily dealt&apos;with situation and produced much talk of desertion of our tribesmen by ^mir, but if hostilities were resumed there is little doubt Afghan regulars.and tribesmen would immediately come d&apos;own in force on Hindubagh, having felt their way by this preliminary expedition, and would seriously threaten Peshin.   Afghan concentration with this object appears to be taking place at Alajviga and. unless Soufront can spare sufficient forces to make Peshin area safe, situation might on (? outbreak of hostilities) be very difficult. Meanwhile, various raids into Loralai are being carried out (corrupt group) could discover by two small gangs from Zhob, same gangs having attacked Gleesoii, Superintendent of Police, on evening of 3rd August, on his way to meet me at Sirki Jarigal, and looted Sinjawi on morning 4th August.   Success obtained by these gangs are disheartening, but not; serious, and .1 hope that after my exhortation and their promises (corrupt group) headmen will co-operate more actively in tracking them down and giving warning of their arrival.   There is no need for depression about tribal feeling which will be on our sido if.only we show force and resolution.&quot; Army Depot made the following comments on above : (1) Establishment of a military  post at Mina  Bazar is  not consideredadvisable at present. (2) Orders already issued to. Soufront in the event of a resumption ofhostilities for an attack on Abdul Quddus, in front of Civilian willbe the best means of countering possible Afghan offensive towardsPeshiii and Hindubagh.
