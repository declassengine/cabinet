From Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India,Sth August 1919.(Repeated to Ministry, Teheran.)(Received 9th.)10744.   Sth August.   Secret.   Following from Mallesou, 30th July :-&quot;Large numbers of Turcoman refugees on or near Persian Frontier are in deplorable condition, having no money and lost everything. They appeal to us for help. Politically at present time I think this very desirable and of greater value than our*feeding starving Persians here last year. I have still two million roubles in hand, and, if approved, could give relief from this. The effect would be beneficial throughout Central Asia.&quot;We are disposed to support proposal as regards refugees actually inside Persia, provided Minister sees no objection and considers relief can be so arranged as not to attract embarrassing influx or act as excuse or incentive for Bolshevik violations of Persian neutrality.3. There should be obvious objection to undertaking relief without employment and to employment near Transcaspian frontier. But if Minister agrees, useful employment might be found for them in Labour Corps or levies away from Frontier. Any unproductive expenditure incurred should in our opinion be treated as inter-Allied liability.
