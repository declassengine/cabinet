CONTROL OF TKE ALI2SH PASSEHGER THAOTIO BY MEANS OJT VISAS.1&apos; %(Circulated by the Home Secretary). --------oOo-------i^^During the war it has been necessary for every alien desiring to enter the United Kingdom, whether from an allied or a neutrtl country, to obtain a visa on his passport from a British Consular Officer especially authorised to grant suoh visas.    In the allied countries and in the prinoipal neutral oountries with the exoeption of the South American Republics, the grant of visas has been supervised by Military Control OffioorB acting under instructions from the Director of Military Intelligence, these Control Officers being in possession of all available information as to enemy and Bolshevik agents, suspects, etc The number of Consular Offioers specially authorised to grant visas has varied in the different oountries.    In South America, for example, all Consuls de Carriers have been se authorised, but in Switzerland visas have been granted almost entirely by the three military control offioers who are stationed in that country though the visa is nominally a Consular one.    In Paris a Bureau de Con-trole for regulating the traffio from- France to the United Kingdom was estab-lished early in the War, one of the Directors being a military officer, and the other appointed by the Home Offices   but certain Consuls de Carriere at the Channel Ports were authorised tc grant visas.With the end of the war it is agreed that the supervision of the grant of visas where such supervision existed must cease to be military, and two questions arises-(l) Should the visa system be maintained and if so for how long? r, and -(8) How should it be worked?The Director of Military Intelligence recently formulated a scheme the object of whioh was to convert the United Kingdom, Prance, Belgium, Italy and the United States into an allied fcone the traffio within whioh should be free from the necessity of visa control, while entry into the allied zone would still be regulated by visaB.    The French, Belgian, Italian and United States Governments were invited by the Foreign Office to send representatives to a conference that was held at the Home Offioe on 15th July but only Belgium and the United States were represented.    The Italian Government made no reply to the invitation and the French Government telegraphed that they thought that control by visa should still be exercised over the entry inta France sf persons from all oountriee.In these circumstances the British representatives at tho Conference came to the oonslusion that their scheme must be regarded as having failed to obtain acceptance,A Meeting wan consequently oalled by the Passport Control Sub-Committee of the Aliens and Nationality Committee whioh was attended by representatives of the Foreign Offioe, Home Office, Board of Trade, Department of Overseas Trade, . Directorate of Military Intelligence, Directorate of Naval Intelligence, and the Director of Intelligence;   this Sub-Gtmnittee made oertain recommendations to the Aliens and Nationality Committee whioh were accepted at their Meeting on 1st   August.    These recommendations were as follows:-
(l)    that in view of the unsettled conditions in Eastern and Central Europe and of the known activities of Bolshevik agents, and the widespread nature of Bolshevik propaganda, a system of visa control in allied and neutral oountries over alien passen-gers desiring to come to the United Kingdom should be maintained for the present and probably for a period of two years;(2)    that in order to afford the greatest possible facilities to the travelling public all British Consuls de Carriere in the United States, Franoe, Italy and Belgium should be authorised to grant visas and that there should be established in eaoh of these countries a Passport Control Officer who will be in possession of all available information as to Bolshevik agenti, etc. to whom the Consuls should r^fer in all cases of doubt or suspicion.(3)    that the existing arrangements for the grant of visas in neu-tral oountries should be maintained.     (As already explained, this system varies to some extent in different oountries but the ten-dency would be to increase the number of Consuls de Carriere who are authorised to grant visas subject always to the supervision of the Passport Control Officer who will take the place of the existing Military Control Offioer).(4)    that in order to facilitate the movements of business men and other persons who require to travel frequently for legitimate reasons, viBas should be granted in proper cases valid for one year f(5)    that in order to meet the expenses involved in the system of visa control the fee for visas should be raised.    The fee for single visas to be 5s./- and for visas valid for one year,  1;(6)    that the transmigrant traffic, Eastward and Westward through the United Kingdom, for which the British Shipping Companies are in active competition with Foreign companies and whioh will be regulated as before the war under bonds given by the shipping oompanies, should be exempted from the visa requirements.It is probable that the amount of money received as fees for visas will make the proposed soheme self-supporting.    In 1913, the number of alien passengers entering the United Kingdom who would have required visas had the scheme then been in operation, was over 400,000.    The Alien passenger traffio shrank during the war to small dimensions but it is now increasing at a rapid rate as shipping facilities are restored and it is expected that early next year it will reaoh a high figure.    It is not, of oourBe, possible to predict how many of the aliens entering the United Kingdom will hold single journey visas and how many will hold visas valid for a year, but having regard to the volume of traffio the return from the issue of visas should amount to between  50,000 and  100,000 per annum.
Tho fees would be credited to tho Foreign Offioe,    It ie believed that all the allied governments intend to insistf for the present, upon aliens entering their territories being in possession of visaB and so far there is no sign that neutral oountrios intend to dispense with visa3J   in fact entry into oertain neutral oountries is more restricted now than at any time during the war.    The only exception may be the United States as it is believed that with the ratification of the troaty by the United States tho visa control over passengers proceeding to that country will automatically oease.    It is possible therefore that a protest against the maintenance of the visa system may be made by the United States Government but the reoent labour unrest in Canada seems to prove that the United states Cannot be disregarded as a oentre of Bolshevik propaganda and it would therefore appear desirable that oontrol over traffic from that oountry to the United Kingdom should be maintained as at present.11th August, 1919.
