REPORT OF SIR HAIOOII.; RA?-.:S/-Y!S 0 01:.0HGOVERHIGIJT STAFFS. &quot;t;&quot;     1 ^iJTO THE RT . HOLL SIR f AffjaAIID, GI!!I)DESA K,C fB.Having regard to the decision of the War Cabinet last week (War Cabinet 603, Iiiin: 3) to require further returns of staff from the various Government Departments, it may be of assistance if we annex a Summary of outowork up to the present time shewing the recommendations made and the action taken by the various Departments so far as can be ascertained.The results as a whole are disappointing; not from any defects in the recommendations, but from the inability or unwillingness of the Departments to carry them out. For example, the ii in is try of llunitions, at a Meeting of the Har Cabinet on Kay 19th, foreshadowed a reduction of 5,000 by June 30th in their Headquarters Staff, and a further reduction of 5000 by July 31st, but they have only been able to effect a reduction of about 1,200 up to July 1st, and ^understand that the reduction during the month of July has been less than 1,000,The returns furnished by the Service Departments shew that the Admiralty Staff increased from 15,902 on March 31st to 17,845 on July 1st: the War Office Staff, which stood at 14,222 on March 31st, had only been reduced by 10 on July 1st, and in the case of the Air Ministry, the Staff, which was 4,090 on March 31st, shews a decrease of 836 on July 1st, but we understand that the Departments of Civil Aviation and Meteorology     &apos; &apos; are nor- rapidly increasing.The Establishments of these Departments were carefully considered by the Committee, but in view of the action which the Department stated they were themselves
taking, and tlx temporary increase of work consequent on demobilisation, it was decided to postpone a final recommcmdation on the subject until after Peace was declared,,     It was understood that the signing of Peace would enable a great acceleration in the dispersal, of temporary staffs to be effected, but it would appear from recent returns, that this is not the-case.The proposals made in your Memorandum G.T.7246 of May 12th for a comprehensive scheme of liquidation of war- work were accepted by the Cabinet, and were carefully worked out by the Establishment Division of the Treasury and the Committee.    They were embodied in a Bill which was circulated to the Cabinet and is at present under the consideration of the Treasury.    Concurrently, steps were taken by the Office of &apos;;v&apos;orks to provide accommodation at the Alexandra Palace for the staffs affected by the scheme * Delay in proceeding with the Bill has, however, prejudiced the success of the scheme.We must also point out that changes in the policy of the Government have affected the settlement of the problem of reduction of staff.     It has been decided that the Ministry of Food must for the present continue, and as a result, the staff of the Ministry, which had been reduced from 6,010 on March 31st to 4,427 on July 1st, remains stationary, by agreement withthe Treasury at the latter figure for the present.Another consequence of this policy has been to delay the demobilisation of the Ministry of Shipping, the staff of which stood on July 1st at 2,148, shewing a reduction of only 9 on the March 31st figures.6.8.19,

MINISTRY OF PENSIONS.This Department was interviewed on May 10th,    The Committee were impressed by the unsatisfactory figures as to output of work which were given in evidence and felt that there must-be serious defects in the Ministry&apos;s organisation.   A detailed inspection of the Ministry was accordingly arranged by the Treasury at the instance of the Committee. . The Report of the Inspectors confirmed the Committee&apos;s suspicions and recommended that given a reorganisation of work on lines suggestei a very large reduction of staff could b  effected.    The reorganised; s tion has been put into operation.4A copy of the Committee1s Report recommending tho detailed inspection is attached - Appendix III.Thd* numbers of staff areArmisvi-iO.?

They recommended., Inter alia, that the organisation
&quot;IIT&apos;-of the Ministry should he put on a firmer basis, the Establishment Division being equipped with real power, that ^programme of reductions should be prepared and that a review of each local staff should, be instivuted.

illMINISTRY OF MUNITIONSgThis Department was interviewed on the 22nd May.   The Committee were Informed that the Ministry were dissatisfied with the rate of the demobilisation of the staff and fore-shadowed at a meeting of the War Cabinet on May 19th, a reduction of 5,000 in the HeadquarUrs Staff by June 30th and a further reduction of a like number by July 31st.   The Committee were also Informed that as an initial step towards this end an Instruction had been issued to the Heads of Divisions requiring them in each case to effect a 33^f % reduction by June 30th,The Committee recommended (a) that should the 33^jf $ order be modified in particular cases it should be Increased to a compensating extent in others so that the 5,000 reduction over the whole should In any event be attained, (b) that a small strong office Committee be appointed to draw up the programme for effecting the further reduction by July 31st.

The Committee recommended^, inter alia, - see Appendix VIII - (a) the appointment of the Sub-Committee forthwith ,vith instructions to enquire into

The Committee, on the evidence tendered to them, felt that in view of the increased work still falling upon the Department in consequence of demobilisation, it would be politic to defer action on their part for the present.     The signing of Peace has, however, now.removed obstacles to immediate reductions of Staff.    The nunbers are:-Armistice Day; 18,539. 31st March: 14,222.1st July: 14,212.ADMIRALTY.This Department was interviewed on the 28th May, The Committee were Informed that special Sub-Committees had been appointed to draw up schemes dealing with Staff requirements for the Reconstruction period (corresponding roughly to the Financial Year) and subsequently.     It was also evident that the signing of Peace would facilitate reductions. The Committee in these circumstances decided to defer action on their part until Peace had actually been signed and the
schemes in question &quot;/ere available * The numbers are:-&apos;w*      1 lik i)Armistice Day:16,082.31st Jiarch:15,902.1st July:17,845.OTHER PEP ARTISTS. Other Departments interviewed were:-mLocal Government Board.Insurance Commission (England).Ministry of Shipping.National War Savings Committee.Military Service (Civil Liabilities) Department.Commission Internationale do Ravitaillement..Liquor Control Board.Board of Agriculture.In none of these Departments did the Committee consider it necessary to make specific recommendations either because the work was increasing rather then decreasing or because the Department was Itself giving close attention to reduction of Staff or for other reasons.At an early stage in its deliberations, the Committee came to the conclusion that immediate relief to the accommodation difficulty could only be achieved by a comprehensive scheme for dealing with Staffs engaged upon the liquidation of war work and they reported in this sense to the War Cabinet on Hay 12th (C.G.T.7246).     They suggested in their Report that all liquidation work should be removed from individual Departments and concentrated in a singleLIQUIDATION STAFFS.

A Bill T/asprepared dealing with such points as required legislation and meanwhile Alexandra Palace was taken for the purposeof accommodating the Staffs and a promise obtained from LordInverforth to transfer there, immediately tho accommodationwas ready, some 4,000 of the Ministry of Munitions staff for which, of course, legislation is not necessary.Difficulties have arisen, however, in carrying this out.The Office of Works have been unable to proceed too as greatan extent as had been hoped with the adaptation of the premisesowing to the absence of Information as to the specific MunitionsStaffs to be transferred and their requirements as to equipment, &amp;c

Appendix IIIReport to Sir Auckland GeddesonMIHISTKI OF pensions the Staff of the Ministry on 11th November 1918 and 51st liarch 1919 was aei followsHeadquarters   ex Hea^Rsaybers (X)      total the Committee have examined at great length ilr. Tinnlswood Establishment Officer of the Ministry, and have also interviewed Ilr. &quot;Voodgato who closely inspocted the organisation&apos;and work of the Ministry in the middle of 1918 in connection v. 1th the Investigations of the Treasury Committee of Staffs.!?nc Committee recognise that an increase in the Staff of the Ministry since Armistice is inevitable by reason of the demobilisation of the Forces, but they are far from satisfied that the present work of the Ministry cannot bo efficiently and expeditiously performed by a Staff substantially less in numbers and aggregate cost than as at present constituted.-&quot;early half of the total Staff is comprised in the Awards Branch.     The output of this Branch averages less than one award per day per person employed on tho work.    The Committee whilst making every allowance for tho many difficulties involved, hesitate to believe that with efficient organisation this output is not susceptible of considerable improvement with a resultant decrease in Staff, and they recommend that an independent onquiry should bo instituted forthwith into tho methods employed in the Branch with a view to the establishment of alternative methods admitting of a higher standard of output being maintained, and that the enquiry should be subsequently extended to tho other main Branches of tho Ministry.11th Ifov.8559 12579107 1553G55 12734(X) Excluding part-time medical and other officers.
The Committee hope shortly to be in ft position to suggest the names of suitable persons to whom the enquiry might be entrusted if this recommendation is adopted, and they consider that it will be possible for the report of the enquiry on the Awards Branch to be available within, say, a week or 10 days of the commencement of the enquiry.The decentralisation proposals of the Ministry accentuate rather than diminish the necessity for the enquiry suggested. In the view of the Committee it would be highly dangerous from the point of view of efficiency and economy in administration to decentralise without the issue to the proposed regions of the most detailed instructions as to, the methods to be employed by them, tod it is obviously essential that the methods so Imposed upon the regions should be such as to secure the maximum output compatible with efficiency and economy.The Commit too also recommend that immediate steps should be taken to place the Establishment Branch of the Ministry in a position of greater authority and responsibility in regard to matters of office organisation.     They consider that the active &quot;Head of the Establishment Branch should be of a rank corres-ponding to the Heads of the other main Divisions, and should be directly responsible to the permanent Head of the Ministry for establishment matters and for those alone.     The Branch should also include some-experienced officers specially charged with the duty of keeping in tho closest possible touch with the various Divisions and devising, in conjunction with.their Heads, methods of work calculated to secure and maintain a satisfactory standard of output.
REPORT TO SIR AUCKLAND GEDDESonMINISTRY OF LABOUR(Headquarters Staff),The Headquarters Staff of the Ministry on 11th.November, 1918, and 51st,March was as follows11th, Il0vember, 1918 31st,March, 19191045 3432Increase2387The Committee haTe examined at length Mr,A, W, Watson, Establishment Officer of the Ministry,The numerous duties assigned to the Ministry since the Armistice, combined with increased activities under its existing functions, have led to substantial i&amp;ddfifciong to the Staff,    The Committee are of $pinion, however, that the number of the staff cannot be justified in every case by the volume of work and that the main reasons for this are(a) the rapid accession of new duties before the Ministry had had an opportunity of framing and developing the lines of a permanent organisation capable of ready and economical expansion;(b) the transfer of large masses of staff, en bloc, from other Government Departments which could not readily be absorbed Into the main organisations;(*c) the absence at the outset of an Establishment Branchwith the requisite&apos; authority and responsibility in regard to matters.of office organisation,The Committee have learned with satisfaction that substantial progress has already been made towards the formationof an Establishment Branch on the lines recommended in the Reportof the Treasury Committee on Staffs (Cmd062) and that thequestion of the permanent organisation of the Ministry has been
referred to a special sub-Committee of the Ministry,    These steps, In conjunction with an undoubted decrease in the activities of the Ministry in various respects justify the expectation that substantial reductions in the Staff ever and above those already effected, will be practicable,    Mr,Watson estimates that a reduction of 750 will be effected by August 1st,next.The Committee recommend:-(I) that the Minister of Labour be asked to issue an office memorandum directing special attention to the urgency and importance of the rapid dispersal of temporary staff;(II) that a programme should be prepared and submitted to this Committee showing(a) the stages by which it is proposed to effect the estimated reduction of 750 by Aug,lst*and (b) the various Branches concerned;(111)that the deliberations of the sub-Committee at present considering the lines of the permanent organisation of the Ministry should be expedited so far as practicable.The Committee have recommended tt the Treasury that the authority under which the Ministry have a free hand in making appointments up to a salary of  500 per annum be withdrawn forth-with, and that a veto&apos;should be placed upon any fresh appointments to the Branches of the Civil Demobilisation and Resettlement Department known as the &quot;Richmond Terrace Branches&quot;,    A similar veto has already been issued by the Treasury in respect of the Appointments Branchy
Report to Sir Auckland Geddes on. MINISTRY OF LABOUR (Ex Headquarters Staff),The Ex Headquarters Staff of, the Ministry on 11thNovember, 1918 and 3l3t March 1919 was as follows11th November 1918 777031st March 1919 22879Increase 15109   - 200$Mr. Cunningham, who joined the Ministry at the end of March last, attended before the Committee with Mr, Watson and was examined at length.The rapid accession of new duties referred to in the Committeefs report on the Headquarters Staff had an even greater effect on the ex Headquarters Staff6     In particular, the new work in connection with the demobilisation of the Forces and the Out-of-Work Donation scheme, necessitating as it did detailed local enquiries into a vast number of individua&apos; cases, involved immediate and substantial additions to the local staffs.In providing for these additions, the Ministry -confronted as it was at a time of grave industrial unrest by a sudden rush of work intimately concerning the industrial world and in which expedition was of paramount importance -adopted the unusual course of vesting complete discretion as to numbers in the local offices and did not attempt any real control from Headquarters except as regards rates of pay.
i d cThe Ministry, in fact deliberately sacrificed the safeguard of central control in favour of the greater expedition likely to be secured by unfettered local discretionsThe Ministry1s action was, in the opinion of the Committee, fully warranted by the exceptional circumstances in which it was placed.     It Is obvious, however, that such an arrangement must inevitably lead to the adoption of varying standards in assessing staff requirements and the Gommittee consider that now that the pressure on the local staffs has admittedly reached, if not indeed passed, its maxi-mum, no time should be lost in undertaking a complete review of each local office with a view to the early elimination of any staff whose employment cannot be strictly justified on the application of a proper standard,lilhen an Establishment Officer w&amp;o appointed to the Ministry, he was not placed, nor has he yet been placed, in a position to exercise effective control over the local staffs of the Employment Exchanges.    The weakness of this arrangement has, it is understood, been recognised by the Ministry, and the Gommittee understand that, in virtue of an agreement recently arrived at with the General Manager of the Employment Exchanges, the Establishment Officer Is now being placed in touch with the local staffs of the Exchanges.    The Committee, however, consider that this does not fully meet the case and that the position and authority of the Establishment Officer of the Ministry In regard to these local staffs should be, so far as practicable, identical with his position and authority as regards other staffs of the Ministry; and for this reason they recommend that the review suggested in the preceding paragraph should be undertaken under the auspices of the Establishment Division.    They also think it desirable
that the opportunity of the review should be taken to impress upon the Inspectors engaged on behelf of the General Manager In inspecting the general working of the local offices that It is their duty&apos; to secure that the staff employed is not excessive *The Committee were much impressed by the evidenc tendered on the subject of the economies in staff likely to result from a proper concentration of local staffs in one building under a single organisation, and they consider that the subject Is one deserving that closest attention of the Ministry in conjunction with the Office of Dorics *The Committee accordingly recommend:(a) that a complete review of each local staff of the Ministry should be at once instituted under the auspices of the Establishment Division with the object of the immediate elimination of any staff trhose employment cannot be fully justified by the volume and nature of the work;(b) that, in connection with the revier/, the opportunity should be taken to impress upon the Inspectors engaged on behalf of the General Manager in inspecting; the general working of the local offices that it is part of their duty to secure that the staff employed is not excessive:(c) that the attention of the Ministry be directed to the extreme desirability, from the point of &apos; view of economy in staff, of the proper concentration of their local staffs In one building under a single organisation and that*: the Ministry be asked to give their special &apos;v. attention to the matter in conjunction withthe Office of Works.

The Committee consider that these reductionscan best be secured by the adoption of a programme of fixed datesby which definite reductions must be made and they accordingly recommend(I) that the Pood Controller should issue instructions to the Heads of Divisions to secure a definite reduction in the Headquarters Staff by a specified date in the near future, It is suggested that the reductions requiredrLn the various Divisions should&apos;aggregate to at least 50^ of the Headquarters Staff as a whole, andT&quot;&quot;tlia.t. .the snecjLfi-ed^date should be 50th,June next,(II) that a programme be prepared and submitted to this Ccimlttae^aiovidins for definite subsequent reductions month by month.The Committee have under consideration the desirability of transferring the Staff of the 1-&apos;Tieat Commission from their present central accommodation in Waterloo Place, and they hope shortly to submit a recommendation On the p*int,A veto has already been placed upon any fresh appoint-ments to the Ministry,

Two main pointshave emerged, viz:-(a) the post-War activities of the Ministry comprise a very large amount of liquidating and disposal work,(b) the Heads of the Ministry are themselves dissatisfied with the progress made in the demobilisation of the staff.UVith,regard to the liquidating work of the Ministry, the Committee propose to keep this work specially before them with a view to its transfer to the proposed Liquidating Organisation at the earliest practicable date*With regard to the demobilisation of the Ministry1s staff, the Committee share the dissatisfaction felt by the Heads of the Ministry at the slow rate of progress*     It is understood that Lord Inverforth, at a meeting of the War Cabinet on Hay 19th., foreshadowed a reduction of 5000 by June 30th, and a further reduction of a like number by July 31st,     It is also understood that, as an initial step towards securing these reductions, an instruction has been issued to the Heads of Divisions requiring them to effect, in each case, a 331l/3$ reduction by June 30th,Instances will doubtless arise v/here the Head of the Division demurs to the required reduction and it may be that
In s;me rf these, Lord Inverforth will feeh that special circumstances demand a modification cf the Instruction.     The Committee recommend that, notwithstanding any such modifications, the original figure of 5000 by June 30th. for the Headquarters as a whfle should be rigidly observed and as a means to this end it is suggested that any modification of the 33 l/3J- reduction should be accompanied by a compensating increase in that peroentAge in the case of other Divisions where prima facie grounds exist for expecting in their case a larger reduction.The Committee also recommend that a small strong office Committee including Mr.Dulanty, should be appointed to draw up a programme for effecting the further 5000 reduction by July 31stft the programme to be submitted to this Committee and to specify in the case rtf each Division the precise reduction to be effected.
