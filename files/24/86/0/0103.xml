It is proposed here to carry this account forward to the present time. The Leicester Programme of the N.U.R. and the demands of the Railway Clerks are given in the Report referred to. The programme of the Amalgamated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen included similar demands to those of the N.U.R., so far as these were applicable to engine drivers, firemen, &amp;c, together with certain special demands. In a large measure the two unions have co-operated in accepting items offered by the Government, and the comprehensive offer of the Government on the 22nd March was accepted in this way. So far as the N.U.R. and the A.S.L.E.F. are concerned, the agree-to 1864) 255  8/19 H &amp; s rpSummary.Part I: Tne Railwaymen&apos;s negotiations.Part I-The Railwaymen&apos;s Negotiations.
ment resulting from this offer still provides the main items upon which, the negotiations have been fruitful, and, together with other minor points, the result may be summarised as follows:-Hours.It was stated in the report of the 5th February that the demand for an 8-hour day was conceded in principle to the wages staff, application in detail being postponed until the 1st February. On the 30th January an agreement was signed between the repre-sentatives of the Board of Trade, the R.E.C. and the N.U.R. giving effect to the principle, and providing for overtime rates where it was impracticable to cut down working hours. A similar agreement was arrived at with the representative of the Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen. The clause in the agreement providing that time allotted for meals should not be counted in the working hours in cases where it had been the practice to allot meal-times in this way, caused further trouble. The N.U.R. Executive repudiated the clause on the 6th February, while already on the 2nd February motormen on the London electric railways, who belonged largely to the A.S.L.E.F., had struck work. A settlement with both unions, however, was ultimately arrived at, to the effect that allotted meal-times were not paid for, the reduction being in actual working hours only. On the 23rd May Sir Auckland Geddes stated that the 8-hour day would have to be elastically applied.Wages.The claim of the Leicester Programme was that war advances be converted into per-manent wages. After considerable negotiation, during which there was in March a threat of a national strike of railwaymen, an offer made by the Government on the 22nd March was accepted. This resulted in the stabilisation of wages until December, 1919, any reduction of war wages under the agreement of November, 1918, being waived. Negotiations for fixing standard rates were to continue, and the whole situation to be reviewed at the end of the year. This was accepted by the two unions, to operate from the 7th. April. Od the 23rd May Sir Auckland Geddes stated that it was unlikely that the new standard wage would in many cases equal the war wage plus the bonus of 33s., a statement which resulted in several resolutions of protest from local branches. Shopmen were excluded from this agreement owing, it was stated, to divisions amongst the unions themselves.Overtime and Special Duty.The claim of the Leicester Programme for double time has not been granted. The Government^ offer retained a previous offer of time and a quarter for week days, and this was accepted by the two unions (N.U.R. and A.S.L.E.F.). For special duties outside ordinary hours, e.g., fogging duty, time and a-half was offered by the R.E.C., and this was in substance accepted on the 21st May.Sunday Duty.Time and a half was offered and accepted by the two unions, whereas double time had been claimed. Certain special Sunday duties of permanent-way men are agreed to be at double rates.Night Duty.The Leicester claim was for time and a-half from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. Time and a-quarter from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m., and time and a-half for overtime on night duty was accepted by both unions.Guaranteed Day and WeekBoth were claimed by the Leicester Programme. a standard week of 48 hours was granted, the standard week&apos;s wage to be guaranteed to all available for duty throughout the week, the guaranteed day to be further considered, the general principle being admitted.  This was accepted by both unions.*With regard to general conditions of work the following are the chief points upon which agreement in some measure has been reached : Joint Management.Equal representation upon managing bodies was claimed in the Leicester programme. The Government agreed that the negotiating committees of the two unions should be
Part II. Demobilisation and Resettlement.Nil.(C 1864)recognised as the medium for dealing with questions of wages and conditions during present negotiations; and further, that a committee should be constituted to report on (i) the setting up of joint committees, and (ii) the continuation of existing Conciliation Boards. In April a list of grades to be included in the conciliation scheme was agreed upon, the question of including dock and quay staffs to be referred to conferences between the dock companies, the N.U.R. and the National Federation of Transport Workers.Rest.The Government offer of the 22nd March of 12 hours between turns in regular and 9 hours minimum in other duties, was accepted, subject to minor modifications made later for special cases, e.g., break down, fog duty, &amp;c.Piece-work, Bonus and Tonnage Systems.The abolition of these systems which was claimed has not been conceded. It has been agreed that they shall continue subject to settlement of rates.Hybrid Grades.It has been agreed that porter-signalmen and porter-guards on certain branch lines shall alone be continued.Holidays.The Government offer of the 22nd March was accepted, i.e., one week with pay,, subject to 12 months&apos; service, with special rates for Christmas Day and Good Friday, or New Year&apos;s Day for Scotland.With regard to the Eailway Clerks, their association apparently Avas recognised upon undertaking to continue the separate organisation of clerical and supervisory grades, in. such a way that the former could not question the conduct of the latter in disciplinary questions. Trouble continued, however, on this question, a strike being finally averted by an agreement that all railway questions were to be dealt with by the Board of Trade through the K.B.C., which recognised the association. Apparently nothing has been agreed upon with respect to their demands, formulated for the E.E.C in January last,, and the present situation is one of widespread discontent, resolutions being reported from branches throughout the country and advocating drastic action. It is reported that a conference of delegates is to meet on the 17th inst. at Birmingham to consider a report upon the progress made in negotiations by the executive, further negotiations having been arranged for during the week.In other grades of the service also there is serious unrest, both as to the application of principles which are agreed upon, and as to outstanding questions. The chief out-standing questions are the position of shopmen, and of dockmen, the difficulty in both cases arising out of the fact that these classes of men are organised in different unions.. The hotel and restaurant staffs are restive, and the supervisory grades are concerned in. the difficulty encountered by the Railway Clerks&apos; Association. The hours of platelayers almost caused a stoppage on the Caledonian Railway last month, and the Company only averted this by concession of the 48-hour week all the year round. The question of stan-dardisation of wages in the various companies after the period of stabilisation has still to be worked out. Current trouble is reported upon the London, Brighton &amp; South Coast Railway upon details of the application of the 8-hour day, and the question of the wages, paid to men taken off the footplate for failure to pass the eyesight test is again to the front. These are matters where agreement had been reached and show that trouble is not confined to outstanding issues. It is reported from Glasgow that the local branch of the A.S.L.E.and.have called upon their Executive to reject the R.E.C. offer of an amended, wage scale. The questions of joint management and nationalisation also remain to complicate the situation. Serious unrest is caused by a mass of apparently small adjust- -ments upon accepted principles, and large questions remain to enhance the difficulties, so caused.
Part III.-Press Comments. . (1) Labour and Socialist Press.(A) Imperial and Foreign Affairs.Eussia.In view both of the more stirring domestic issues that have recently been coming to the front, and the competing interest of Hungary, the amount of material on the Russian question in this week&apos;s papers is less than it has been for some time past. &quot; The Call &quot; emphatically protests against the sending of further naval forces to Russia and demands an immediate armistice. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; regards with great alarm the successes of Denikin, and demands the discontinuance of the &quot; blockade against Russia.&quot; The Merthyr &quot; Pioneer &quot; quotes with considerable pleasure from &quot; The Ukraine &quot; (which it says is the official weekly bulletin of the Ukraine Press Bureau in London) to show that while the men responsible for this publication regard the Bolsheviks as enemies, they are much more hostile to Koltchak and Denikin. The Merthyr &quot;Pioneer,&quot; &quot;The Worker&quot; (a Huddersfleld I.L.P. journal) and &quot; Forward &quot; publish an article circulated by the Labour News Service which quotes from the &quot; Syren and Shipping &quot; and the &quot; Economist&quot; to prove that the Soviet system is showing signs of&quot; making good,&quot; and which concludes with the remark, &quot; it is not surprising that the militarists are raising such a clamour at present to smash the Soviet system before the eyes of the world are open to the facts.&quot; Mr. F. H. Goole, in &quot; Justice,&quot; concludes that the opinion of those English people who have been in Russia within the last two or three years is, on the whole, strongly in favour of intervention in Russia, and that it &quot;is open to doubt whether civilisation can safely leave Russia &quot; at the mercy of the tyrants who now hold her by the throat.&quot; &apos; In the &quot; Democrat,&quot; the series of articles by a &quot; Russian Engineer &quot; under the title of &quot;A Journey in Bolshevik Russia &quot; is completed. He thinks that the peasants in many parts of the country would welcome any change of government that might leave them in peaceful possession of the land they cultivate, and that Lenin&apos;s newer and more moderate policy can hardly hope to meet with success, because chaos is too complete, feelings are too embittered and the Soviet Government in Moscow cannot control its local subordinate officials. In this paper, also, M. Issaiev discusses the Soviet constitution and maintains that it is undemocratic,-Hungary.&quot; The Call&quot; regards with undisguised annoyance, the fall of Bela Kun&apos;s government as a victory for capitalism; it is, however, in the opinion of this paper, a victory won only by the weapon of starvation. Part of the blame for this event is put upon the leaders of Allied Labour, &quot; who have allowed the Governments a free hand to deal with the Social-ists abroad when they should have been provided with, plenty to do at home.&quot; This paper believes that had the workers done in the case of Hungary &quot;what they are gradually beginning to do in the case of Russia,&quot; the Hungarian Soviet would not have been &quot; thus temporarily &quot; overthrown. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; hesitates to believe in the fall of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, but concludes that, should the news be true, the workers of Hungary will forthwith suffer a terrible martyrdom. Mrs. Philip Snowden deals with the whole Hungarian problem in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; and complains that Hungary has been denied the right of putting her case before the people of the Allied countries and before the Peace Conference. Mrs. Snowden maintains that by the proposals of the Allies the racial unity and the commercial and economic life of Hungary will be destroyed. She defends Magyar civilisation as against Roumanian and maintains that the Roumanian subjects of the old Hungary will be put in a worse position by their transference to Roumania. Mrs. Snowden concludes by asking whether International Socialism cannot do something to prevent this &quot; iniquitous division of the ancient State of Hungary.&quot; The &quot; New Statesman&quot; expresses the opinion that the Bela Kun regime was never representative of the majority of the people. Colonel Wedgwood concludes, in &quot; Forward,&quot; his articles on his recent visit to Hungary. He tells with pleasure the story of an interview with a member of the Bela Kun administration who professed a devotion to the teachings of Henry George and who announced that the Government did not intend to take any more land from the peasants. He tells of a similar interview with another less important member of the Government who expressed the opinion that communal production in the factories must fail and. could never hope to compete with capitalist production. So Colonel Wedgwood &quot;found them coquetting with Guild Socialism in place of State production&quot; as a possible method of saving the towns.  Colonel Wedgwood states that
Bela Kun&apos;s government depended upon a &quot;Pretorian Guard &quot; of &quot; Terror Troops,&quot; which was estimated to number &quot;from 10,000 to 40,000 men. On the whole, Colonel Wedgwood&apos;s judgment is that the Hungarian experiment in Marxian Socialism has been a failure and that this failure goes to confirm his own predilection for the many alternatives in Socialist theory to &quot; Marxism.&quot;The International Conferences^Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, in &quot; Forward,&quot; describes his journey to Lucerne, but the only remark he makes of peculiar interest is his expression of a fear that the International is threatened with the danger of becoming a &quot; cockpit of those nationalist strifes which both belligerent sides, but especially the Allies, fomented for military purposes, and which now appear as permanent results of the European unsettlement.&quot; He refers to the presence at Lucerne of Ukrainians and Czeko-Slavs. The &quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; complains of Mr. Henderson&apos;s references in his opening speech at the Conference to Russia, and recalls that he welcomed and assisted Kerensky &quot; when he came to this country asking for intervention.&quot; This paper concludes that Mr. Henderson is a &quot;danger to Socialism and the working class.&quot; The &quot; New Statesman&quot; discusses the post-war prospects of the Second International. Two main difficulties, in the opinion of this paper,, cut across the unity of. the International, namely the position of the Russian Bolshevists and the Germans. This journal thinks that the International must take the Soviet system into careful consideration. Similarly the question of the action of the German Socialists at the outbreak of the war must be settled. If a satisfactory way of dealing with these two matters is arrived at, the &quot;New Statesman &quot; believes that the International has a considerable future before it. It may now be but a paper force with little authority, mainly interesting the officials of the national movements and a handful of intellectuals, but, in the opinion of this paper, it has a chance now (resulting from the mental awakening of Labour due to the war) and it needs only the enunciation of a clear and broad policy, which may appeal to the reason and the imagination of the proletariat, to make it a power in the world. Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; discusses the Trade Union Conference at Amsterdam as well as the Lucerne Conference. He refers to the attempt made by the &quot; pre-war section to put the German delegates into the dock on the charge of complicity in the war,&quot; and warns M. Vandervelde (who raised the question of &quot; responsibility &quot; at Lucerne) that when it comes to apportioning its responsibility for the &quot; betrayal of International Socialism,&quot; he and some of his French and British friends may have a damning indictment presented against them. He is amused at the election of Mr. Appleton as President of the Trade Union International and thinks that this conference was &quot; dominated by the pro-capitalist delegates from Great Britain and America.&quot; It is noteworthy that he regards Herr Sassenbach&apos;s statement &quot; as a partial confession of responsibility, which was afterwards repudiated by his colleagues.&quot; Mr. Snowden would appear not to have read thoroughly or sympathetically the press reports of the proceedings of the Amsterdam Conference.United States.The &quot; Nation &quot; and &quot; New Statesman &quot; discuss the proposals submitted to Congress providing for compulsory training in the United. States. The demand of the American railwaymen for some form of nationalisation of the railways excites more attention, and the &quot; New Statesman &quot; prophesies that the Presidents recent speech to Congress on the cost of living will prove to be the opening of a new chapter of his administration. The &quot; Leeds Weekly Citizen &quot; congratulates the American Railroad Brotherhood not only on having given notice to terminate the present system of private ownership oi railwaymen in America, but also for having an alternative well considered and ready, providing for a triple control by public, employees and; officials. Mr. Philip Snowden in the &quot;Labour Leader&quot; refers to the recent racial disturbance in Chicago in order to ask a rhetorical question: &quot; Why does not the Government intervene and stop these atrocities in America as it claims to have intervened on account of atrocities not nearly so bad in Russia .?&quot; The &quot; New Age &quot; criticises the recent manifesto of the American Federation of Labour on the part science may play in production. This paper repeats, &quot; for the instruction of its American cousins of the Federation of Labour,&quot; its theory that what is wrong to-day is not the productive system, but the distributive system, that super-production is not a remedy, but rather an aggravation of under-consumption, and that whoever talks of increasing production before providing for increased consumption, by means of better distribution, is talking Capitalism.* See Report, 6th August, pp. 122 and 123, and this Report pp. 143 and 144.
Other.*The &quot; New Statesman &quot; discusses in a sympathetic manner the articles of the Peace-Treaty which deal with the principles under which mandatory powers are to administer the territories entrusted to them. It voices a demand for the attachment to the League of an institution analogous to our Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, to which appeals against abuses of administration on the part of the mandatories could be carried. This paper then proceeds to discuss the constitution of such a Court of Appeal, and suggests, that it would be reasonable to insist that as a condition of membership a State should make some reasonable contribution, if not in time and men as mandatory, at any rate in money, to the costs which must necessarily be incurred, in the opinion of this paper, in acting as a trustee under Articles 22 and 23 of the Covenant of the League of Nations. Mr. Claud Mullins discusses, in the &quot; British Citizen,&quot; the kind of democracy which is most suited to India. He is convinced that it is wrong to take our British form of democracy as a model for Indian government, and suggests that the better course is for India to evolve her own system of self-government. He advocates a development of the principle of communal representation, in which he thinks India&apos;s political salvation lies. In the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; Mr. H. K. Moderwell, writing from Milan on the 22nd July, deals with the strikes in Italy on the 20th and 21st July. He complains that there seems to have been an international campaign afoot to make it appear that the Italian strike was a dismal failure, but the information he gives does not differ much from the press reports. This paper also continues its account of the Winnipeg strike. This week the thesis is developed that it was &quot; Militant Capitalism &quot; which was responsible for the bitterness of the strike.(B)-Home Affairs.Political and Industrial Outlook.The general discussion in the papers reviewed this week on the political and industrial &apos;.. outlook revolves round five events in the week ending the 2nd August. These are the declaration of the result of the Bothwell by-election on Tuesday, the 29th July; Mr. churchill&apos;s speech in the House of Commons on the same day; the publication of the long letter from Lord Askwith in &quot; The Times &quot; of the 30th ; and the strikes of policemen and bakers on the 1st and 2nd August. There is also some discussion of direct action, of the use of Parliament, and of panaceas for industrial unrest.(a) Bothwell By-Election.&quot; Forward &quot; analyses the vote at Bothwell. The opinion is expressed that few socialists will give undue weight to the figure of the majority or will be content to rest on the assumption that Bothwell now stands on unassailable ground. &quot; It would be idle to pretend that the labour figures represent a keen class-conscious vote.&quot; The largeness of the majority is attributed partly to the swing of the pendulum, partly to the fact that the Coalition candidate was a mineowner, but mainly to the fact that the people had a feeling that they had been betrayed by the Government. The majority is regarded as a Labour majority rather than a Socialist majority. &quot; Rob Roy,&quot; in &quot; Forward,&quot; describes Mr. Robertson, the successful candidate, as a member of the left centre of the Labour Party, which stands for sane and democratic socialism. On the other hand, he states that the Labour Party candidate at Swansea was of the extreme left type, and draws from these opinions of his the obvious conclusion.(6) Russian Policy.The &quot; Call &quot; emphasises its opinion that the Secretary of State for War is not to be trusted, and asks the question, &quot; Are the rank and file of the miners, railwaymen, and transport workers going to be foolish enough to allow his explanations to influence their decision ? &quot; It maintains that, as it stands, the pledge to abolish conscription is worthless, and suggests that the release of conscientious objectors has been due to the action of the Triple Alliance. With regard to the withdrawal of British troops from Russia, it is argued that the important question is not the presence of English troops in Russia, but the assist-ance in money and munitions which is being given to Koltchak and Denikin, and it is suggested that the Triple Alliance ought not to be satisfied until this assistance to the anti-Bolshevist armies is stopped. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; expresses similar opinions, but adds a new point in suggesting that British military missions with the armies of Russian generals may be a means of evading the &quot; promise &quot; to withdraw troops from
Russia. Mr. Norman Angell, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; discusses the speech of the Secre-tary of State for War from a logical point of view in this fashion : &quot; The war against the Soviets is either just or unjust.&quot; &quot; If the Soviets really menace Europe, why is Mr. Churchill talking about withdrawal ? &quot; If it is unjust this would appear to be Mr. Angell&apos;s argu-ment what about his &quot;intrigues with Sazonoff and the Tsarist emigres ? &quot; Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; maintains that a careful reading of the speech of the ^Secretary of State for War will show that he &quot; really conceded nothing of the demand of the Triple Alliance,&quot; and continues, &quot; His promises about conscription are valueless; all will depend on the international situation next April.&quot;(c) Lord Askwittis Letter to &quot; The Times.&quot;The &quot; Woolwich Pioneer &quot; was the only paper last week to deal with Lord Askwith&apos;s letter to &quot; The Times &quot; of the 30th July. This week, however, it attracts much attention. The &quot; Yorkshire Factory Times &quot; and the &quot; Leeds&apos; Weekly Citizen &quot; summarise the letter. Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; expresses his opinion that no more scathing ndictment of a Minister was ever formulated, and states that nobody who has been in close touch with the Prime Minister&apos;s methods during the last 12 years will disagree with Lord Askwith&apos;s criticism of him. The &quot; Nation &quot; thinks the letter worthy of a special article, and bases upon it a general criticism of the Government. It puts forward three tests by which to judge the Government, namely, finance, the maintenance of social and political order, and order and responsibility in administration. In the opinion of this paper, the nation needs to be taken out of the atmosphere of. war, and addressed first to its inter-national task, which is the restoration of European life and of the spirit of human brother-hood, and then to the healing of its deep internal wound. &quot; No war government can rule much longer without bringing on the sequence of such a war, which is Revolution.&quot; This letter is also referred to in the &apos;f Cotton Factory Times.&quot;(d) The Strike Epidemic.The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; expresses the opinion that a revolutionary ferment has seized sections of the British working classes, and that a revolutionary impulse is spreading among the workers. This paper complains that the revolutionary feeling is only temperamental, and is rather the result of a vague tumultuous unrest than of a concrete ^determination to secure any definite reform. Socialists are blamed for this fault, because they have done their work inefficiently, and instead of teaching socialism, have hitherto spent most of their time and energy in advocating minor reforms and endeavouring to win elections. The&apos;&apos;Daily Herald,&quot; the Labour Party and the trade unions are stated by no means to be working for socialism, and therefore this paper concludes by complaining that the divine fire of discontent is being dissipated, and its outcome being repudiated. Mr. F. W. Jowett, in the &quot; Bradford Pioneer,&quot; concludes that the capitalist system is going headlong to destruction. He attributes the prevalence of strikes to profiteering (unchecked because the country has been tricked into electing a profiteering Parliament), and to the weakness of the Labour Party which cannot in the teeth of the vested interests change the economic policy of the nation. In the opinion of &quot; Justice,&quot; workers are now in danger of being deceived in industrial matters by men and women who know little or nothing of the labour movements, but who profess to see in a strike a glorious manifestation of class solidarity. As an example the case of the Police Union is taken, and it is stated that the officials of the Police Union, being mainly men inexperienced in the work of trade unions, have had to follow the advice of others. Unfortunately, in the opinion of this paper, they did not take the best advice, and no experienced trade union leader would have thought the strike vote taken at the end of May to he a safe guide for an order to strike two months later after the men&apos;s demands had been practically granted. The article concludes, &quot; the trade union leaders of the seventies and eighties often lacked imagination, and saw little beyond better conditions in the organised members, but some of their sense of responsibility would not be amiss in the trade union world to-day.&quot; The &quot; Woolwich Pioneer &quot; complains that in the bakers&apos; strike the employees in co-operative societies, though the societies were prepared to accede to the claims of the men, went on strike, and thus an opportunity was lost to prove that labour through its co-operative movement was able to supply the needs of the community for bread until the union brought the master bakers to reason.,(e) Direct Action.The question of direct action is mainly discussed this week in the LLiP. journals. In the &quot; Worker &quot; the opinion is expressed that the whole mental make-up of the men and
* Qf. Report, 30th July, pp. 92 and 93.t Qf. ibid, p. 93, and Report, 21st July, p. 72.women, of England is that of progress through evolution rather than through revolution., &quot; Education and propaganda are still as essential as ever.&quot; &quot; The control of Parliament is in the hands of the workers if they wish it, and the geographical Parliamentary con-stituency has not failed yet as Both well amply proves, and if the check on Parliament by industrial action has proved beneficial, that check has come from an educated majority of workers.&quot; Mr. James Nichol discusses the same question in another article in the same paper. His article may be compared with that of the Editor of the &quot; Leeds&apos; Weekly Citizen &quot; in that paper on the 26th July.* He regards direct action as a means by which the by-election results may be strengthened in order to compel a re-election of Parliament. Mr. D. Griffiths discusses the question in the &quot; Labour Leader.&quot; The essence of his philos-ophy is expressed in this sentence : &quot; If I lived in Kussia or in Russian conditions I should be a Bolshevist in this country, but in our conditions I believe the social revolution can be brought about constitutionally and without violence, when the workers really desire such a revolution.&quot; The same gentleman contributes a similar article to the Merthyr &quot; Pioneer.&quot; The Merthyr&quot; Pioneer&quot; argues in like manner. &quot;The Government created the political situation that the threat of direct action was called forth to meet.&quot; &quot;Let them submit their works to the criticism of a general election, conducted sanely and calmly.&quot; &quot; The task of the Government is so to govern that the new weapon of &apos; direct action &apos; shall not be needed.&quot; &quot; The Call &quot; discusses Mr. J. H. Thomas&apos; speech at Derby on the 26th July and expresses the opinion that it was &quot; a flagrant act of treachery,&quot; and, in another article, suggests that he should be removed from a position in which he may do harm. The &quot;Democrat&quot; condemns direct action, not only as the negation of democracy,, but also because its success would destroy our financial credit abroad on which, it is the constant opinion of this paper, we depend so much. The &quot; New Age &quot; dislikes the whole movement because of the discredit it may bring upon Labour as a whole. Its opinion of the origin of the Eussian intervention agitation is this: &quot; Direct action, with the people behind you that is one thing; but direct action with only the Liberals behind you-that is a price too high to pay for the restoration of Mr. Asquitli to the premiership.&quot;&apos;-(/) Remedies for Political Unrest.The &quot; New Statesman &quot; contains an article entitled &quot; A Defence of Parliament,&quot; in which the only noteworthy point, in this connection, is the statement: &quot;Parliament must become the mouthpiece of the nation instead of the mouthpiece of an accidentally victorious Cabinet, if the average citizen is to turn to it with either hope or trust.&quot; In &quot; The Call,&quot; Mr. H. Stewart Ryde continues the discussion on &quot; Parliamentarism and Trade Union,&quot; which commenced in this paper on the 5th June.f He. supports Mr. Bryan&apos;s conclusions that neither is Parliament in itself a source of social or political progress, nor are trade unions as at present organised. He emphasises, however, Mr. Biyan&apos;s advocacy of Parliamentary action as a method of propaganda, and even goes so far as to defend a policy of ameliorating the general condition of the proletariat through Parliamentary action, on the ground that it makes the worker more fit to fight capitalism. In this connection an article in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; on &quot; The Weakness of the Labour Party &quot; is of interest. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; confesses itself to be anxious that the Parliamentary Labour Party should be an effective force in the House of Commons. Its present weak-ness is attributed to its present leadership, and to the absence in its ranks of men of wide political knowledge and strong debating power. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; does not think that the recruiting of the candidates put forward at elections almost exclusively from the ranks of Trade Union officials can supply the Parliamentary Party with the kind of men who are essential. The action of the Southport conference in abolishing the small con-tribution hitherto made from the common fund to the expenses of all accredited Labour candidates is regarded as a step in the wrong direction and an appeal is made for the pooling of all political funds, so as to give full freedom to local organisations to select candidates, unhampered by considerations of financial support. The&apos; &quot;British Citizen,&quot; in an article entitled &quot; Nearing Niagara,&quot; compares the approaching Parliamentary recess &quot; at one of the most critical junctures in the country&apos;s history,&quot; to Nero&apos;s alleged conduct in fiddling while Rome was burning. This paper registers a warning that the &quot;present negative manner of handling industrial crises and social problems is fatal to the stability not only of the Government, but also of society.&quot; It is stated that the National Democratic Labour Party cannot afford to have its reputation &quot; smirched with the tar of supineness,&quot; and it is claimed for the party that it now possesses qualities (which are welcomed by the people), namely, a transparent honesty, and a determination to fight courageously in the best interests of the country. After stating that the &quot; extraordinary fusion in its member-ship of Conservative, Liberal, Labour and Socialist elements gives a spiritual significance.
to its gospel,&quot; and that the time has come when the country is ripe to embrace its faith, the article concludes by promising to devote from September onwards certain columns in. this paper to an exposition of the aims and policy of the party.(g) Remedies for Industrial Unrest.In the &quot; Democrat,&quot; Mr. E. Gittins discussed the psychological side of the industrial unrest, and attributes this phenomenon to a loss of morale on the part of the average worker. He thinks that the workers have lost hope in the present system (which has not given them what they expected), and have therefore fallen readily under the influence of the &quot; reactionary.&quot; He deplores the fact that the &quot; reactionary &quot; has had the first innings and urges the need for the enunciation on the part of the Government of a definite con-structive policy which may convince the workers that it is intended to do everything possible to satisfy their needs, and which may thus restore their hope and faith in the present system. Similarly, in another article in the same paper, it is urged that slackness on the part of the Government is responsible for much of the industrial unrest, and an appeal is made for &quot; more co-operation, and less preaching.&quot; The &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; pub-lishes an interview with Sir Charles Macara, in which he insists that the essential thing is that Labour and Capital should work together in friendly co-operation. He expresses a regret that the Industrial Council formed in 1911 was not kept alive during the war. In a leading article in the same paper his opinions are endorsed. Industrial unrest is attributed to profiteering, the new National. Industrial Council is welcomed, and the work already achieved by the Joint Councils of the various industries is commended. The &quot; Nation &quot; develops its view that the National Industrial Council must be used as a means of demo-cratising industry.* It must be made, in the opinion of this paper, a permanent body with a genuinely popular and representative character, and might be invested to advantage with governmental powers. Care should be taken, however, to retain for it a maximum of independence and to withhold from it &quot; all powers of enforcing awards or judgment,&quot; because, the &quot; Nation &quot; thinks, the appeal to reason can only settle our industrial affairs: the use of State force is by no means advisable. It is noteworthy that the &quot; Leeds Weekly Citizen &quot; summarises in a very fair spirit the recent report on Labour unrest and other matters prepared for the Federation of British Industries.f The report is described as an important document, and credit is given to the &quot; capitalists &quot; for &quot; wishing to be generous.&quot;The Police Strike.&quot; The Call&quot; calls upon its readers to show the sincerity of their faith in class solidarity by according to the policemen on strike moral, and wherever possible financial, support. The Merthyr &quot; Pioneer &quot; argues that the policeman is a worker and is therefore entitled to the workers&apos; right to organise. Mr. Philip Snowden in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; and the &quot; Worker,&quot; regards the police strike as something of a tragedy, and suggests that the or-ganisers of the Police and Prison Officers Union erred in taking at their face value the many resolutions passed in their favour at Trade Union Conferences. A fetter course, in their opinion, would have been to approach the great trade unions and to have let them fight out the issue. A somewhat similar suggestion is put forward by the &quot; Clarion,&quot; which thinks the only way for the Police Union was to press the Parliamentary Labour Party to take up their cause. This paper supports the policy of the Police Bill, and agrees with the view that the police ought not to be granted the right to strike. In this connection this paper plagiarises the Samson metaphor which &quot; Justice &quot; used on the 26th July.J The &quot; New Statesman &quot; agrees with the &quot; Clarion,&quot; but attributes the origin of the trouble to the &quot; obscurantism of the authorities up to the time of the last strike.&quot; The &quot; British Citizen &quot; puts the blame for the strike on those Labour Leaders who have been advocating full trade union privileges for the police. It thinks that the men who came out on strike have been duped.Goal Industry.In the &quot;Labour Leader,&quot; Sir Leo Chiozza Money criticises in detail Sir Arthur Duckham&apos;s report on the Coal Industry, and asserts that neither the miners nor the Labour Party will have anything to do with it. The &quot; Clarion &quot; regards the policy the Government may adopt on this matter as a test question, and, in view of what it thinks to be a Teluc-tance on the part of the present House of Commons to consent to nationalisation, calls, for a General Election.* Of. Keport 30th July, p. 93. f Of. Report 6th August, p. 122. X Cf. Report 30th July, p. 93.(C 1864) U
Prices and Profiteering.The Profiteering Bill was published too late to be dealt with in the majority of this week&apos;s papers. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; and the &quot; Worker &quot; regard its introduction as a &quot; wrecking &quot; of the Select Committee, on High Prices and Profiteering, allege that the Bill itself deals only with the retailers, and regard the tribunals as camouflage. The &quot;Nation&quot;objectsto the policy that it is aimed only at &quot; Profiteering,&quot; which this paper maintains is only one of the many causes of &quot; Hi^h Prices.&quot; The &quot; New Statesman,&quot; in a long article, develops its theory that the true policy is an extension of the policy adopted during the war for controlling the prices of khaki and army clothing.* The &quot; New Age &quot; complains of the popular press, including the &quot; Daily Herald,&quot; in so sedulously cultivating the impression that Profiteering is the main cause of high prices. This paper expresses the opinion that prices must be fixed considerably below the &quot; conventional cost of production in order effectively to distribute the product of national industry.&quot;Other.The money grants recently recommended by the House of Commons to be given to the Generals and Admirals are condemned for their largeness in the &quot; Labour Leader/&apos; the &quot;Leeds Weekly Citizen,&quot; the &quot;Clarion,&quot; the &quot;British Citizen,&quot; the &quot; New States-man &quot; and the &quot; Nation.&quot; A contributor to the &quot; New Statesman &quot; discusses the position of Agriculture, and pleads that agriculture stands in a very special position, needs State assistance, and cannot thrive without the benevolent interest of the Government. A contributor to the &quot; Leeds Weekly Citizen&quot; vigorously attacks military training in schools. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; gives an account of the so-called rosyth rent strike. The &quot; British Citizen &quot; defends Works Schools, as provided for by the Education Act, 1918.(2) The Press on Demobilisation and Resettlement.The Ex-Service Man and Trade Unionism.The &quot; Morning Post&quot; (12th inst.), in a leading article on this subject, asserts that the trade unions are shutting the door in the face of the ex-Service man, since they think proper to limit the number of men who may be trained in any one occupation. The result-is an odious tyranny, which must be broken if freedom is to be in England. If the Govern-.ment have not the courage to secure the right of every man to work, the ex-Service men must combine together and clear the road. In this connection the paper notes with pleasure the formation of an Imperial ex-Services&apos; Association.The Ex-Soldier and Socialism.v The &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; in an article on this subject, refers to the efforts being made by the press to teach the ex-soldier to regard the trade unionist and aocialist as his enemy. Thus the capitalist, who really regards the soldier as he regards other grades of labour as a commodity to be bought and sold hopes to divide the ranks of the workers that each in turn may be cohquered. The place of the ex-soldier is in the Socialist Movement, since no sectional grievance can be remedied apart from the reconstruction of the whole order of society. The Labour Socialist Government of Queensland is quoted as having made ample provision for its ex-Service men.The Conditions of Unemployment Donation.The &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; complains that the Ministry of Labour seems to have no steady policy as regards the conditions attaching to the unemployment donation. The new regulation which is particularly criticised lays down that the applicant must be &quot; genuinely whole-time unemployed.&quot; This apparently falls unfairly on weavers who leave a &quot; no notice &quot; shop in the hope of returning when more material comes in ; since they are not entitled to the donation unless the contract of service is definitely terminated. A further dilemma ensues if the weaver herself terminates the contract, since then she is considered to have voluntarily left her employment, and thereby forfeits her donation claim.* Cf. Report 23rd July, p. 71.
Part IV.-General Topics and District Reports. (1) General Topics.National Industrial Conference.The Minister hopes to introduce before the Recess the Minimum Wage and 48-Hours&apos;&apos; Bills, in which the recommendations of the conference are embodied. It is understood that the employers and trade unions will then proceed to constitute iheir respective sides of the National Industrial Council.Direct Action.The decision of the conference of the Triple Alliance helti on the 12th inst. to postpone the ballot on direct action was not unexpected. As was pointed out in last week&apos;s Report, the policy had already showed signs of leading to a sharp cleavage in the ranks of Labour, and the events of the past few days, notably the decision- of the Lancashire and Cheshire Miners&apos; Federation on the 9th inst. to instruct their members to vote against direct action, and various intimations from leaders of the constituent unions in South Wales that a majority in favour of direct action could not be expected from that district, together with the strong stand taken by Mr. J. H. Thomas and other influential national leaders, apparently convinced the conference that a majority in favour of direct action would either not be obtained or be so small as to contain the danger of disruption within the Alliance. The resolution passed by the conference recommends that a full delegate conference should be summoned to which a report of the whole proceed-ings should be submitted.Nationalisation and the Coal Situation.The situation with regard to nationalisation is on the whole unchanged, but recent reports from South Wales indicate that certain sections of miners in that coalfield are hostile to the demand of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain for nationalisation. In that district there is said to be a widespread and definite reaction against the extremist elements, consisting for the most part of young men, inspired by the doctrines of the Plebs League. The older miners are becoming irritated at the constant stoppages of work on all sorts of pretexts, and the consequent serious losses in wages. In last week&apos;s Report a meeting at Gilfach Goch was mentioned at which a resolution was passed protesting against the nationalisation of the mines.&apos; A similar resolution was passed at a largely attended meeting at Pontypridd, and it is stated that this attitude is to be emphasised by the holding of three great demonstrations of protest in representative centres of the South Wales coal-field. These examples of opposition to nationalisation, however, must at present be regarded as a distinct exception to the general miners&apos; attitude. Further resolutions of protest against the Report of the Coal Commission and the nationalisation of mines have been reported during the week from the Halifax Town Council, the Gas Committee of the Salford Town Council and other bodies.Engineering and Shipbuilding.The apparent deadlock reached in the negotiations between the employers and trade unions in the engineering and shipbuilding trades for a 44-hour week caused much dis-satisfaction on the Clyde, where a movement has been taking place in favour of the shorter week ever since the 47-hour week was introduced on the 1st January, 1919. In the event of the employers continuing to maintain the attitude they adopted on the 24th July (see this Report for 30th July), it is stated that the Clyde leaders suggested that a strike ballot should be taken. A delegate conference of the Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Federation and the Amalgamated Society of Engineers met on the 13th inst. in London and received a report from the negotiating committee with regard to the situation. The extremist views of the Clyde delegates were not approved, and the conference decided to recommend the appointment of a committee consisting of six employers, six members of the negotiating committee, and an independent chairman, to investigate the economic effect of a 44-hour week throughout the engineering and shipbuilding industries, having regard to the methods of production and foreign competition. In the meantime it was recommended that the negotiations with regard to details in the application of the 47-hour week should be completed without delay. The moderate attitude adopted by this con-ference is remarkable in view of a further cause of dissatisfaction in the engineering and shipbuilding trades arising from the recent decision of the Court of Arbitration disallowing their claim for an increase in wages. (See this Report for 30th July.) It may be mentioned, however, that the strike of engineers and allied workers on Tees-side for(C 1864) U 2
a 44-hour week, which lasted eight weeks, terminated on the 11th inst., the men agreeing -on a ballot-vote to submit their claims to a joint conference, and failing a settlement there, to allow them to go to arbitration. The failure of this strike probably exercised a deterrent effect on the extremist delegates at the London Conference.Railway Employees.The unrest among railway clerks, referred to in last week&apos;s Report, continues to grow. During the past week resolutions have been passed by the Liverpool, Crewe, Cardiff, New-port, Pontypool, Aberavon, Llanelly, Newcastle, Bishop Auckland and other branches of the R.C.A., expressing extreme dissatisfaction with the progress of negotiations, and calling for a special conference! to discuss the situation with a view to taking steps to expedite the negotiations. In response to the demand of the branches, it is reported that it has been decided to call a special conference of the delegates of the various branches of the R.C.A., at Birmingham on Sunday, to receive a report from the Executive Committee on the negotiations that have been taking place with the Railway Executive Committee. The Executive of the R.C.A. was in session on the 12th, 13th and 14th August, and it is announced that further negotiations are taking place with the R.E.C.Dissatisfaction also exists in the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen. The Manchester District Council at a special meeting on the 8th inst. resolved that unless the decision of the Leeds Conference with regard to balloting members is given effect to at once, a general stoppage will be demanded to enforce the full wages programme. The Glasgow branch decided on the 11th inst. to instruct the Executive to reject the Railway Executive Committee&apos;s offer of an amended wage scale, and to sup-port a strike on, the 28th August, failing a prior settlement.National Amalgamated Labourers&apos; Union.The annual conference of this Union took place at Swansea last week. The President, Mr. T. J. Wilson, in his presidential address, strongly recommended a policy of trade union amalgamation, and it was resolved that three members, together with the General Secretary, should wait upon the Executive Committees of the Dockers&apos; Union and the General Workers&apos; Union, with the object of bringing about the amalgamation of the three bodies. A resolution was also unanimously adopted demanding that the income-tax limit be raised from  130 to  250 and affirming that, if this demand were not granted, the conference was in favour of a Joint National Conference of all trade unions, in order that arrangements might be made for the taking of common action in refusing to pay income tax until the  250 limit should be established. A motion was passed demanding an increase of 100 per cent, in Workmen&apos;s Compensation scales,and a resolution was carried that no. aliens should be admitted to membership of the union.-Commercial Travellers.The annual conference of the Commercial Travellers&apos; Association in Dublin on the 6th inst. considered a resolution that &quot; steps be taken to obtain for commercial travellers proportional representation on any Whitley Councils which might be formed, negotiations to be entered into, if necessary, with any trade union interested.&quot; With reference to this resolution, the secretary stated that it was not possible to organise commercial travellers on a trade union basis, which was the basis of employees&apos; representation on Joint Industrial Councils. The question of the representation of commercial travellers on a central committee, which was to co-ordinate the work of the Councils, had been raised, but as yet no such committee had been formed. He had approached the Labour Party with regard to the representation of commercial travellers on the proposed National Joint Industrial Council and this application was being considered. In view of this statement the resolution was then withdrawn. At this conference a motion was passed wiewing with alarm the growth of amalgamations and trusts.Ex-Service Men.The Grand Council of the Comrades of the Great War has issued a manifesto calling the attention of its members to the fact that the country is in danger and asking them to declare definitely that they are on the side of law and order, will uphold the Government of the day, and will actively support the civil authorities.The picketing of the Manchester Employment Exchanges, Town Hall, and other public offices threatened by the National Association of Employed and Unemployed ^x- Service Men and Women, owing to grievances connected with unemployment, the necessity of signing on at Employment Exchanges on four days a week to qualify for out-of-work
donation, and other questions, was to have commenced on the 5th inst., but the Association has decided that there is no need for it. As a result of an interview with the Municipal Authorities, the Gas Department of the Manchester Corporation has given work to 30 men, and 50 other members of the Association have found permanent positions within the last three weeks. It is announced, however, that no reply has been received to the demand the Association made that the unemployment donation should be raised to  2 a week. If no reply be received within a reasonable time, it is said that the Association will certainly organise a march of unemployed ex-Service men to London in order to demand a reply.It is reported that the National Association for the Employment of ex-Soldiers suc-ceeded last year in placing 6,157 men in permanent and 1,092 in temporary employment. Since the Association was founded in 1885 it has placed 189,266 men in permanent -employment.Police.The Police Union continues to display the greatest activity in its efforts to obtain support from Trade Unionism. Mr. J. H. Hayes has stated that the union has 120 able speakers and is holding meetings all over London every day. Resolutions promising support to the Police Union (in some cases with a demand for the resignation of the Home Secretary and the dismissal of General Macready) have been passed by the Birmingham Trade and Labour&apos; Council; the North-West London branches of the Licensed Vehicle Workers&apos; Society; the Southport Trades Council; the executive committee of the Postal and Telegraph Clerks&apos; Association ; a conference in Liverpool of district committee shop stewards, and representatives of workshop committees of the Shipbuilding and Engineering - Trades Federation; Liverpool branch of the National Association of Car-penters, Cabinet-makers and Joiners; and other Labour organisations^ It is reported that, in some cases, the police who remain loyal, while disowning the Police Union, object to the Police Bill. For instance, at Manchester on the 5th August, a meeting of policemen Tesolved to ask the Government to receive a deputation on the Bill.  (See also Part V.)The Furniture Trade Lock-out.The series of events which led to the lock-out in the furniture trade on the 26th July is somewhat complicated, and it seems worth while to give a brief summary of the negotiations. For several months the members of the National Amalgamated Furnishing Trades Association have been endeavouring to secure a national rate of wages and hours. At present the rates vary extensively, not only from district to district, but even within one town, as, for example, in High Wycombe. During recent months strikes have taken place in some districts (for example, Wigan and Barnstaple), and negotiations in others, on the question of rates and hours, but the demands and concessions show little con-formity; for example, claims and agreements relate to 44, 461, 47 and 48-hour weeks.In June an agreement was reached at Liverpool for 2s. an hour, and improved over-time rates, the weekly hours being 46f. These concessions at once led to a demand on the part of the Manchester employees for an advance of Qd. per hour and a 44-hour week. A manifesto issued by the Furnishing Trades Association, in upholding the action of the Manchester employees, refers to the existence of an agreement of 1912 that Manchester rates should not be lower than Liverpool. At present the rate for the greater part of Manchester is Is. Sd. per hour, compared with the new Liverpool rate of 2s. On the other hand, the manifesto issued by the National Federation of Furniture. Manufacturers &apos; denies that there was any recognised agreement for wages in Manchester to be brought up to the level of Liverpool. And, furthermore, it points out that the Manchester claim for an advance of Qd. an hour would raise their rate to 2d. more than the new Liverpool rate, while the hours demanded are 2^ less than at Liverpool. When the Manchester demand was received in June, the employers referred it straight to the Conciliation Committee of the Furnishing Trade Joint Industrial Council without any previous consultation with the men. No settlement was arrived at, and the men tendered five days&apos; notice to cease work; in the interval the intervention of the Ministry of Labour was unavailing, and a strike began on the 27th June. In the meantime in North-East Lancashire a demand had been put forward for an advance of 5d. per hour and a 44-hour week. Efforts to effect a compromise were unsuccessful, and without the submission of the dispute to the J.I.C. Conciliation Committee a stoppage occurred the week after the Manchester strike. The Trade Union&apos;s manifesto (already referred to) maintains that the North-East Lancashire* On the 14th inst. a meeting of delegates representing Liverpool trade unions decided that, in order to secure re-instatement of the police, there will be a general stoppage of work in the port next Wednesday for three days.
employers themselves broke off negotiations, and the Trade Union July Report states-that the employers, in their refusal to grant the wage increase, were influenced by those in High Wycombe and other exceptionally low-paying districts. On the 2nd July the National Federation, of Furniture Manufacturers suggested a joint national conference to be held in London within seven days if the operatives in the meantime resumed work, and offered to recognise all awards of the proposed national conference. They concluded their offer with a threat of a general lock-out unless the Lancashire men returned to work. These advances by the employers, and a second intervention on the part of the Ministry of Labour proved unavailing, and the threatened lock-out took effect on the 26th July.It appears to be the opinion of the Furnishing Trade Union officials that there is a movement among certain employers to resist any rise in wages. They also believe that the employers on the J.I.C. are not representative of the country, and also that those who are on the Council are particularly opposed to regional rates. Considerable resentment is. expressed against the Manchester employers, who, in referring the men&apos;s demands straight to a committee of the J:I.C, are said to have initiated a system whereby &quot; no district would be able to take any action without submitting the issues to the J.I.C.&quot;A meeting of the J.I.C. was held at the Ministry of Labour on the 13th August. It was decided to call a conference of the parties concerned in the lock-out, and a sub-committee is to meet on the 19th August to consider the terms of reference to the conference and to fix the date on which it shall meet.Irish Trade Union Congress.The 25th annual conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress met at Drogheda on the 4th August, over 200 delegates being present. The President, Mr Thomas Cassidy, Derry, in his address, welcomed the principle embodied in the League of Nations, but thought that its present constitution could not secure the confidence of. the workers. He condemned the interference of the Allied and associated powers in. Russia and the organised propaganda against the Bolshevik leaders. He referred to the-difficulty of deciding the Irish Labour Party&apos;s attitude as to the advisability of entering into the fight for Parliamentary representation, and pointed out that the Irish problem was more complex than ever, being not only a question of Home Rule, but in addition, involving the conflict of Parhamentarianism and the policy of Sinn Fein. But in any case he hoped that preparations would be made all over Ireland to contest Local Govern-ment Board elections in the interests of Labour. At a subsequent meeting, in electing a National Executive, Mr. James Larkin was declared disqualified, though the refusal of a passport to him from America, to Ireland was adversely commented on. The Congress passed a resolution calling upon the workers of England, Scotland and Ireland to use all the force at their command to put an end to the military occupation of Ireland. Mr. T.. Johnson stated that it was their policy to encourage bodies of Irishmen, for instance on the Clyde and the Tees, to join English Labour organisations, with a view to helping the-British Labour Party to a more militant policy industrially and politically. A resolution was passed by 131 votes to 50 according increased powers to the National Executive to^ ensure joint action in industrial and political matters. Mr. 0&apos;Lehare (Drapers&apos; Assistants), who moved the resolution, said it was proposed to amalgamate unions with the ultimate object of having a single all-inclusive Irish Workers&apos; Union, to be responsible for financing and controlling all the larger movements. Subject to this authority the workers would be organised into industrial sections, self-governing so far as the affairs of their own. industries are concerned.Amalgamation.The amalgamation ballot of the Boilermakers&apos;, Blacksmiths&apos; and Shipwrights&apos; Societies is reported to have resulted in a large majority in favour of amalgamation. The result of the ballot of members of the Lancashire, Cheshire and North Wales branch of the Amal-gamated Carters&apos;, Lorrymen and Motormen&apos;s Union on the proposed amalgamation with the Amalgamated Association of Tramway and Vehicle Workers was announced at Bolton on Monday. Of a possible total of 8,000 votes, 5,918 were recorded in favour of amal-gamation and 582 against. The question of the amalgamation of all the trade unions in the cotton industry into one Federation was considered at a meeting at Manchester on the 11th inst. of the Legislative Council of the United Textile Factory Workers&apos; Association, and it was decided to adjourn the consideration of the subject to a special conference of executives of the operatives&apos; amalgamations and the Legislative Council of the United Textile Factory Workers&apos; Association, to be held in Manchester on the 18th inst. This
matter has been considered before, and to judge by what took place during the recent negotiations in the cotton trade when a decided cleavage was revealed in the. ranks of the operatives, an amalgamation of the unions does not seem very probable. In any case, unions so accustomed as the Textile Unions to negotiation are certain to approach the matter very cautiously. With reference to the amalgamation between the Furnishing Trades Association and the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters, Cabinet Makers and Joiners, referred to in the Report of the 18th June, voting is now proceeding for members of the General Council of the new amalgamation.Overtime.The ballot vote by the National Society of Machine Woolcombers on a recent offer of the employers to the effect that 6s. per week advance be paid to men and 4s. per week to women, on condition that the employees agree to work 7 hours per week overtime on night turn and 5 hours per week on day turn has been completed. The offer of the employers has been rejected by 2,715 to 2,051.Non-Unionism.At a district committee meeting in Jersey of the Dock, Wharf and Riverside and General Workers&apos; Union it was unanimously resolved that on and after the 1st.September the members of the union should refuse to work with either male or female non-unionists. . It was also agreed to refuse to handle goods consigned to non-union firms on and after that date.Trade Union Topics. , -It was reported at the annual meeting of the Midland Mining Officials&apos; Association that the bulk of the members of the Gresley branch had joined the National Association of Colliery Deputies. . .The Executive Committee of the National Union of Scottish Mine Workers, which met in Glasgow on the 31st July, considered the rules for the proposed Scottish National -Association of Mine Workers, in which it is suggested that the present system of districts should be eliminated.The National Society of Amalgamated Brass Workers and Metal Mechanics at its annual conference at Bristol last week, decided by.a unanimous vote to become affiliated to the Labour Party.  It was also decided to change the name of the society to the Brass . and Metal Mechanics&apos; Union.Income Tax.The South West Ham branch of the National Federation ot Discharged and Demobilised : Sailors and Soldiers has forwarded to the Chancellor of the Exchequer a resolution express-ing the opinion that the imposition of the income tax should be removed from those who, having fought and suffered for the country, are in receipt of an income below  250 per annum, as it is considered that they have paid a life income tax while serving for over four years at Is. and Is. Qd. per day, without striking or receiving overtime pay, and that the deficit in revenue be recovered from those they have defeated. West London electric branch of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen have resolved that in view of the fact that their wages are below the standard of subsistence, they refuse to pay the income tax.  See also &quot; National Amalgamated Labourers&apos; Union.&quot;Old Age Pensions.The Plymouth branch of the N.U.R. has passed a resolution expressing the opinion that immediate steps should be taken to increase the old age pension.. Second (Berne) International.An account of the opening meetings of this conference was given in last week&apos;s Report. On the resumption of the plenary sessions on Wednesday, the 6th August, Mr. Vliegen (Holland) submitted the report of the commission appointed to consider the reconstruction of the International. The preamble of the new statute declares that the International aims at: (1) The political and economic organisation of the working-class for the abolition of capitalist Society. (2) The creation oi a real League of Nations. (3) The representation and defence of oppressed peoples and subject races. The three forms of expression in the workers&apos; movement are defined as political, industrial and co-operative organisations, which must, as autonomous bodies, continue to strengthen their international unity and
at the same time must take every opportunity to reach a common understanding by joint action in order effectively to use their resources to maintain a world peace. Herr Crispien (German Independent Socialist) challenged the conference to define its position clearly by recognising the existence of a class war. He thought the preamble should recognise workers&apos; councils as a vitally important phenomenon because it was the productive workers themselves who must be the holders of political power. M. Mistral (France) proposed, amendments to the preamble tending to make it more revolutionary in tone. Herr Molkenbuhr (German Majority Party) referred to the peace terms and described them, as a declaration of war on the workers of all countries.On the afternoon of the 7th inst, M. Renaudel (France), submitted a report of the commission on general policy, and read the following resolution : &quot; In consequence of: the modifications that have occurred in the forms of democratic and representative institutions, especially as a result of the part played by revolutions in the transformation,, the International will have to submit itself to a test. The International is ot the opinion, that the situation has never been so profoundly revolutionary and that there has never been an opportunity so favourable as the present for building up all socialist organisation,, putting an end to capitalists&apos; exploitation, and ensuring normal production as well as the equitable division of the production of the soil and labour.&quot;The commission of the Conference appointed to consider the general policy of the International proved unable to arrive at an agreement with regard to the attitude to be adopted towards Russia, and eventually two reports on the Russian question were submitted, to the Conference. These were discussed on the Friday and Saturday, and eventually a new draft was carried, in which Allied support for Denikin and Koltchak was denounced,, the proletariat and its Parliamentary representatives were called upon to put an end. to the blockade, and the decision to send a commission to Russia was affirmed. The mam feature of the debate is said to have been a conflict between the two German parties which Mr. Henderson attempted to overcome by telling the Germans that the International was not the place to fight on a national difference.Court of Arbitration. During the week ended the 9th August, 1919, the Court of Arbitration heard 27 cases, 14 in London and 13 in Glasgow. The principal cases concerned the Building Trade and the Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades.Joint Industrial Councils.Flour Milling. The second meeting of the Council took place on the 22nd July. The following business carried out by the Executive Committee was adopted : (1) Resolved that consideration of commercial questions is outside the scope of the National Industrial Council, as these questions are dealt with by the National Association of British and Irish Millers.. (2) Arising out of an award concerning members of the National Amalgamated. Union of Engineman, &amp;c, it was agreed that all local disputes in future should be referred to the Joint National Council for settlement. (3) An agreement was arrived at regarding a national basis of wages which, subject to the Flour Mills Control Committee raising no objection, will be published in due course. (4) The Council requested the Home Office to take action with regard to the following resolution:-&quot; That having regard to the danger to life and limb consequent upon the present faulty methods for unloading flour, &amp;c.,. at bakehouses and other places of delivery, an enquiry should be instituted without delay with a view to incorporating such additional provisions in the various Factory Acts as may meet the situation.&quot;Road Transport.-A full meeting of the J.I.C. was held on the 25th July when. Mr. Dutfield reported on behalf of the Executive Committee. Mr. Ben Smith moved that the three resolutions which had been agreed by the Executive Committee be put.. The resolutions were then put by the Chairman and were adopted. These resolutions-provide for (1) a week&apos;s holiday, with pay, per annum upon certain conditions, the resolution to become operative in 1920; (2) payment for Christmas Day, Good Friday, the four Bank holidays and National proclaimed holidays. (The usual Scottish holidays to apply in the case of Scotland.) (3) Payment for attending horses on Sundays and on the holidays referred to above, the amount of duty and the rates of payment to be determined by the District Council. A long discussion then took place on the demands for increased wages and overtime rates. It was finally resolved that the Council agree to the principle of improved overtime rates and that the question of such rates be submitted to the Executive Committee for consideration and report, and that the demand for an increase of wages, be referred to arbitration.
Silh-ThQ fourth quarterly meeting of the Silk Council was held in Manchester on the 24th July. The Council is gravely concerned on the subject of the effect of Italian and Japanese competition in the Home Market in manufactured silk goods, and the Com-mercial Sub-Committee have been instructed to make urgent representations to the President of the Board of Trade oh the question. An application from the Operatives that 14 days&apos; holiday with full pay should be granted each year was referred to the constituent Associations for further consideration and similar action was taken with regard to a suggestion that the working week in the industry should be reduced from 49 hours to 48.Wool (and Allied) Textiles. An adjourned meeting of the Council was held in Bradford on the 22nd July. The question of the Council taking steps to secure that employers and operatives should be brought within their respective organisations was further considered, and in view of the diametrically opposed opinions of the two parties it was ultimately agreed that disputes arising from questions of non-unionisrn should not be dealt with by the ordinary arbitration procedure of the Council, but that nothing in this decision should preclude the Council from taking any action that might be necessa:.y in any emergency. The application of the operatives for a fortnights holiday with full pay was postponed for further consideration. A Committee fully representative of all the interests involved was appointed to enquire into and report on the serious position Avhich. has been created in the industry by a shortage in the output of tops. The report of the Committee appointed to consider the question of the employment in the industry of dis-abled ex-Service men was referred back for further consideration pending the completion of the census now being taken to determine the extent to which disabled men have been or may be employed in the industry.Plumbing&apos;. The National Joint Industrial Council for the Plumbing Industry (which has not received recognition from the Ministry of Labour), resolved, at a meeting held at Harrogate on the 24th July, to request an interview with the Ministry of Labour on the subject of recognition of the Council. Sir David Shackleton received representatives of the Council at Montagu House on the 5th August, and said that since his previous interview with representatives of the Council on the 11th April, the Ministry of Labour had continued ts investigations of the problems involved. The question was primarily one of industry and craft. It arose in many industries, and its complications were such that it was impossible for the Ministry of Labour to give satisfaction to all the parties concerned. The Ministry is continuing its investigations, and the National Industrial Council, when set up&apos;, would also be able to advise the Ministry. It was hoped that proposals would be put before Parliament before the end of the year to meet such questions, but it would be unwise for the Ministry to pledge itself to any definite policy at present.Made-up Leather Goods. A meeting of the Council was held on the 30th July. Mr. Dale attended to explain the position as regards the Minister&apos;s approval being given to the Wages Agreement of the Council. It was agreed to request the Minister to receive a deputation on the subject and to put before him the views of the Council as regards National Wages Agreements. An application was put forward by the National Leather&apos; Trades Federation for payment for national holidays and one week&apos;s holiday per- annum. After a long discussion no agreement was reached and it was decided to refer the matter back to the constituent associations. A claim was put forward by the operatives&apos; side for payment for overtime at the rate of time and a-half and double time on Sundays and national holidays. The employers&apos; side offered time and a-quarter for the first two.hours, time and a-half after two horns and double time on Sundays and national holidays. Neither side would make any concession and the matter was referred back to the associa-tions.Trade Boards.New Trade Board.-T-he Minister has made Regulations with respect to the constitu-tion and proceedings of a Trade Board for the tobacco trade in Ireland, and has established a Board with Professor R. M. Henry as Chairman.Lace Finishing Trade Board.-Th.Q Board propose with the consent of the Minister of Labour to issue a Notice of Proposal to vary the general minimum piece-rates for warp lace and hair-nets. The Board, at the request of the Home Office, considered what steps should be taken with a view to the prevention of accidents, and agreed to afford such assistance as they were able, but as the trade is chiefly concerned with workers in ware-houses and with outworkers they were not clear in what way they could co-operate.Gorset Trade Board. The Trade Board have agreed to issue a Notice of Proposal to fix a general minimum time rate of 8%d. an hour for female workers other than learners, and(C 1864) X
of Is. an hour for male workers of 22 years of age and over with lower rates for female learners and for younger male workers. They propose also to fix a piecework basis time-rate of 9\d. an hour for female workers, and of Is. 3f$. an hour for all male workers, and to fix overtime rates for male and female workers.(2) District Reports.London and South-Eastern.Unemployment. A small net decline in&apos; unemployment is reported, the totals for men and women decreasing, and those for boys and girls increasing. This rise in juvenile unemployment is probably temporary, and is due to the school-leaving period being reached.Resettlement. Few fresh developments have been reported during the week. The Islington Borough Council have voted  44,000, in addition to the Road Board grant of  50,000, for road work, which is to be commenced forthwith. The Kent War Agricultural Committee have arranged for a number of their committee, together with representatives of Local Employment Committees, to attend at the Exchanges in order to interview suit-able men and induce farmers to give them a trial. It is hoped that a large number of agricultural vacancies may thus be filled.General. Things have been generally quiet, no doubt on account, of the holiday ; the exceptions being the disputes among the railwaymen, the police, and the bakers.Great secrecy is being observed concerning the progress of the ballot in the Triple Alliance, and it is not expected that any information will be available in advance of general publication of the result in the newspapers.South Midlands and Eastern.Unemployment. An increase of over a thousand on the live register is shown by the latest return. The rise in unemployment is most marked at Cambridge, where the building strike is mainly responsible, at Leicester and Loughborough which are affected by the dyers&apos; and trimmers&apos; strike, at Oxford where a number of girls have returned from tem-porary work and the colleges are closed for the vacation, and at Peterborough where the rise is attributed mainly to the registration of women for the flax harvest.Resettlement. No new developments have been reported during the week. South-Western.Unemployment. The position is almost unchanged, a small increase being reported during the week.Resettlement. Transport difficulties arising from shortage of railway trucks is still acute in the Plymouth area. Commercial interests are favourably disposed towards a suggestion that coastal traffic should be subsidised in some directions.A shortage of brick-burners is keeping several brickfields idle in the Isle of Wight, and in other parts of the division a similar shortage is reported. A hairbrush factory is shortly to be opened at Cowes which will provide employment for a number of women, and a &quot; motor-scooter &quot; works is expected to open in September.General. The main interest has been in connection with the attitude of the police, the railway men and the bakers. Throughout the area the police have remained loyal; the effect of the bakers&apos; action has varied widely in different districts, but in the majority of places the trouble has not been serious. As regards railways, local traffic has been unaffected.Local authorities, realising the serious effects on the rates caused by demands for increased wages, are taking up the attitude that these increases, or applications for them, must cease. , *West Midland. - sUnemployment.-A continuance of the steady decline in unemployment is reported, the live register being reduced by nearly 3,000 in the week. An increase in the number of juveniles unemployed has been caused by the fact that a school-leaving period has just been reached, but is considered to be only temporary.Resettlement. A general shortage of skilled labour in the building trade is reported, which, as regards carpenters, joiners, painters and plumbers, could be largely overcome if it were possible to increase the mobility of labour. The shortage of housing accommo-dation is however a serious obstacle. There is stated to be no improvement in rail and canal transport, complaints tending to become more general rather than to decrease.
Information from all industries suggests that output is being restricted. In the building industry, output is stated to be only half of what it should be, and complaint is made that men working on foundations lay only the same number of bricks as those working on super-structure.Many leading firms, especially in the foundry and stamping industry, are confident of an abundance of work for the next eighteen months, and orders are stated to be abundant in nearly all branches of the engineering industry.General. Holiday conditions account for the absence of any important developments. Little stir was caused in industrial circles by the action of a small section of the Birming-ham police ; and holiday making and speedy settlements made the strike in the baking industry less inconvenient to the public than was expected.Yorkshire and East Midlands.Unemployment. The latest available return for the week ending the 1st August shows an increase of over 24,600 on that for the previous week. The increase is almost exclusively due to the coal strike.Resettlement. The general position is rendered abnormal by the coal strike. The shortage of houses and the slow progress made with building schemes undoubtedly tends to active unrest. Tenders received by the Leeds Corporation show a cost of over  909 per house, exclusive of the cost of sites and of road-making. Tenders for fishermen&apos;s houses at Scarborough gave a cost of approximately  1,000 per house. The cost of building opera-tions on such terms would appear to be one of the main causes of lack of progress.General-Apart from the deadlock in the Yorkshire miners&apos; strike the industrial position is not unfavourable.The action of the ironfounders&apos; society in repudiating, independently of other unions, the national wages agreement is regarded as an example of the spirit productive of &quot; break-away &quot; strikes, and, consequent dissipation of strength which operates as a safeguard against national upheaval. Lack of good leadership, and the failure to abide by the deci-sions of leaders weaken the authority of union officials. The situation as regards a call for a national strike may probably diminish in intensity&apos; in a month or two.North-Western.Unemployment and Resettlement. The usual weekly report has not been received.General. The position appears still very unsettled. While there is little likelihood of further trouble in the Lancashire collieries for the present, the engineering trades are watching keenly the position in the Liverpool area, and it appears that it would take little to produce trouble. The local officers of the Manchester ironmoulders are reported to intend to withdraw their application for a wages advance, and to leave the matter to be taken up nationally by their executive.Northern.Unemployment. A small reduction in unemployment is reported, mainly among men. At Jarrow, Stockton and Workington, increased unemployment among men, chiefly in the iron and steel trades, is reported for the third successive week. The position in the iron and steel district as a whole, however, while remaining serious on account of the coal shortage, is considered better than might have been anticipated.Resettlement-Output from the Cleveland ironstone mines is stated to have dropped from 8 tons per man per day before the shortening ot hours to between 5  and 6 tons. Two large firms complain of serious difficulty in obtaining home ores, and are turning to foreign sources. Plans are being made, in default of an improvement, for the importation of ironstone from Normandy in large quantities. Shortage of transport facilities continues to impede the iron and steel firms. The Workington Iron and Steel Co. have discharged 800 mon owing to lack of orders. The steel trade in West Cumberland is unsettled by American competition. One firm have reduced output greatly, and may close their Bessemer department entirely, while another firm are maintaining operations only from week to week.The Consett Iron Co., Ltd., who had to close down three mills when the three-shift system came into operation, have now obtained enough labour to restart two, and hope shortly to restart the third. The Millom and Askam Hematite Co., Millom, state that the shaft-sinking for their new mine is practically complete, but that the non-delivery of machinery is retarding progress. It is reported that the reopening of a mine at Egremont is under contemplation, with an ultimate prospect of employment for 1,000 men, and that(C 1864) X 2
efforts are to be made to restart a colliery at Walker, which was closed in 1918 by order of the Coal Controller. A brickworks at Choppington, which has been idle during the war, has been reopened. A number of extensions to works in Sunderland and Wallsend are reported.General. Domestic baking and irregular work by non-union men relieved the position created by the bakers&apos; strike. The railway and police disputes have not materially affected the area, and the resumption of work on Tees-side is a satisfactory feature in the general position.It is still the view of certain classes of employers that there is bound to be a general industrial upheaval before satisfactory working conditions are reached, and that the sooner matters are forced to an issue the better. On the other hand, the policy of dealing with sporadic disputes is considered to be far safer than one incurring the risks of a national dispute.Wales.Unemployment. Unemployment has decreased by about 750, the position remaining virtually unchanged. Concern is felt at the decision to close the Cyfarthfa Ironworks at the end of the month, which will affect 400 men. The step is attributed to labour unrest and the inflated cost of production.Resettlement.-]^ the Carnarvon area a new quarry company has been formed to utilise slate-waste in the manufacture of asphalt, bricks, cement and pottery goods. The erection of plant for this purpose is expected shortly to absorb a number of workpeople in the area.A number of training schemes for disabled men and for unemployed women are now under consideration.General. Comparative quietude continues to be a feature of the situation. The holiday spirit is abroad, and there appears to be an evaporation of interest in the problems raised by the Triple Alliance. &quot;A demand has been made at trade union meetings and conferences that there should be a revision of the regulation which prohibits payment of out-of-work donation to workers who are involved in a strike, but who do not belong to the trade responsible for it. The demand is that there should be no examination of each case as to its merits, but that automatic payments should be made when workers are deprived of work by the action of the trade to which they do not belong, but alongside which they work.Scotland.Unemployment. A satisfactory decrease of approximately 1,800 is recorded by the live register. The position in the textile trades at Paisley is still somewhat serious. An improvement at Aberdeen is expected in one or two trades, and especially in the building --industry which should profit by a number of schemes for the extension of factories and other private concerns. At Clydebank a poor start has been made after the local holidays, and the position as regards unemployed men has not improved.Resettlement. The lack of trawlers is still maintaining unemployment at Aberdeen, the boats which have been released needing to be reconditioned.Telegraphic delays and unsatisfactory cable arrangements are the subject of complaint by a firm of exporters in the Paisley textile trade who are largely concerned with the Eastern market. They assert that within the last fortnight an order for 30,000 pieces was lost through this cause. The Paisley area is still suffering from lack of steel plates for shipbuilding, of iron castings for the engineering industry, and of woollen and cotton materials for the textile trades. The lack of iron moulders continues to prove a distinct hindrance to industrial resettlement, expecially in the Paisley and Johnstone areas.The effect of the labour troubles in Yorkshire is beginning to be felt, and may retard the resumption of full-time working after the local holidays.General. The general industrial situation throughout Scotland remains satisfactory. The expectation that the developments in Liverpool would be reflected by some similar action on the Clyde has proved groundless.Orthodox trade unionists repudiate the assertion that the extremist element has captured the trade union movement, especially in the Clyde district, and assert that the numbers identified with the Clyde Workers Soviet movement are infinitesimal.
&amp; ...Police.Part V.-Disputes.     - &quot;j ^(a) Involving a Stoppage of Work.In the opinion of the authorities the police strike ended on the 7th August. The City of London Police passed a resolution on that date repudiating the strike. In Liverpool the trade union negotiating committee, which was formed in connection with the police strike, issued a manifesto appealing to trade unionists in the Mersey district to demand a reinstate-ment of the police strikers. Tom Mann, speaking at Bootle on the 12th August, stated that drastic action would be decided on unless reinstatement was granted.Coal Miners.Yorkshire. A conference of South Yorkshire miners and owners was held at Sheffield on the 11th August. The proceedings were private. At the Leeds conference of West Yorkshire miners and owners it is reported that the owners refused to discuss any details of the dispute until the men returned to work.The Council of the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Association at a meeting at Barnsley on the 12th August decided to advise the men to resume work owing to the absence of support from the Miners&apos; Federation. This advice is to be given to the men at their branch meetings on the 13th.Scotland. The strike of miners at Lochore, Fifeshire, which began on the 7th July, con-tinues in spite of recent efforts to bring about a settlement.S. Wales. Colliers employed at Messrs. Buck&apos;s Colliery, Pontypool, ceased work on the 11th August owing to a dispute over percentages. The management state that they will not negotiate until the men return to Work.Lead Miners.A strike has been in progress for over a week at the Mill Close Lead Mine, the employees demanding that the management should discharge non-union men first, and those last employed second. The management refuse to concede these points, and the strikers have been dis-charged; it has been notified, however, that individual applications for reinstatement will be considered.Railwaymen.The strike on the London and South-Western and on the City and South London Tube Railway collapsed on the 7th August.Building Trades.At Liverpool and Bury the building trade operatives are reported to be on strike for an advance to 2s. per hour instead of the Is. 8d. fixed for the North-Western area. A conference has been arranged for the .15th August between representatives of the National Federation of Building Trades&apos; Operatives and the employers in the North-Western area, when the question of an advance to 2s. an hour will be discussed. It may be noted that the furniture trade operatives in Liverpool have recently been granted a similar advance.The Carlisle building trades&apos; strike, which began in June, was settled on the 13th August. The wages and the 44-hour week demanded by the men have been conceded, but no back pay.Bakers.The majority of bakers returned to work on the 11th August.   The terms on which the employers will receive them back are as follows :  (1) That the men accept arbitration on hoiirs and wages.(2) That they return to yoxk on the old conditions of hours and wages, including night work.(3) That the re-engagement of men on strike must be settled with the individual employers. (4) That when the men have returned to work there shall be a meeting of representatives of employers and employed to consider what improvement can be effected in the conditions of night work. The employers wish it to be understood that no arbitration award must take effect until the Ministry of Food has revised the price of bread.  The secretary of the Liverpool Operative *   Bakers stated on the 11th August that the Liverpool bakers would not resume work until they saw a chance of having their grievances redressed.Municipal Employees.As the Kensington municipal employees did not return to work on the 6th August they were dismissed by the Council, and 170 new men were engaged. The majority of strikers, however, returned to work two days later. The Paddington strikers were also dismissed on the 6th August. A 47-hour week has been adopted by the Councils at Barking, Wood Green and Southgate. The Westminster1 City Council on the 12th August adopted certain proposals made by the Joint Industrial Council for local authorities&apos; non-trading services, the chief one : V     being a 47-hour week exclusive of meal times.
Tramwaymen.The strike at Liverpool ended on the 8th August. The men resumed work on the old conditions; the question of wages and hours is to be considered by the Tramways Committee on the 29th August.Quarrymen.It is reported that about 500 quarrymen are on strike in the Whitworth, Shawforth and Rossendale districts of Lancashire, the chief demand being for the recognition of the men&apos;s union.Engineers and Allied Trades.The men employed in engineering and allied trades at iron and steel works in the Tees-side district decided on the 9th August to resume work and accept the employers&apos; offer of a joint conference. Failing a settlement by this conference, the points in dispute will be referred to arbitration. The strike has been in progress since Whitsuntide, the men demanding a 44-hour week.Other.A strike of discharged soldiers in training at the L.C.C. School of Arts and Crafts, South-ampton Row, occurred on the 13th August; the cause of the strike is said to be the delay in the payment of allowances to over 50 of the men, resulting from the transference of control from the Ministry of Pensions to the Ministry of Labour.(b) Not Involving Stoppage of WorkCoal Miners.The Lothian Miners&apos; Board on the 11th August decided to postpone the general strike in support of the Polton strikers and to meet the Coal Controller.A special conference of the Lancashire and Cheshire Miners&apos; Federation was held at Bolton on the 9th August, when the representatives were instructed to press further for a 14-2 increase in piece rates and to ask the Miners&apos; Federation to convene a conference on the question.Co-operative Employees.Negotiations have been proceeding since May concerning the demands of the co-operative employees in a district embracing parts of Cumberland, Lancashire, Cheshire, Yorkshire and North Wales ; no settlement can be arrived at, and the question of handing in notices is now under consideration. In the Airedale and Bolton districts a week&apos;s notice will be handed in on the 16th August. The employees ask for a reduction of hours from 48 to 44 per week and a new scale&apos; of wages.Agricultural Labourers.The demand of about 3,000 farm workers in Warwickshire, Staffordshire and part of Nottinghamshire for Is. Qd. an hour overtime during the harvest has not been granted. Notices, which were to expire on the 13th, have been suspended, and in the meantime the Agricultural Wages Board is endeavouring to arrange a joint conference.The threatened strike of Hertfordshire agricultural labourers has teen averted. The men have agreed to accept, in addition to their ordinary wages, an individual bonus of  4 for the harvest, including overtime.Dockers.The Plymouth dockers are refusing to work overtime unless they are paid double rates. An offer of time and a-half was refused by the men.Other.As the result of a mass meeting of the organised London packing-case and box-makers an ultimatum has been sent to employers threatening a stoppage unless a conference is arranged by the 22nd instant. The workers demand higher wages and improved working conditions, and their demands are stated to have received no consideration at the London District Industrial Council.R. S.
