^ Document is t-- , mpA of(P 4d83j) /*Vom Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department,     &apos;V&quot;&quot;IW-&apos; -&apos; &apos; -5i7i Awgf/wt 1919. llSflf&apos;o,X\l^i&apos;Q,i&apos;ity A. Clear the line. ^ti^-Fofeign Secret. Your telegram No. 1123 S., dated 4th August. Afghanistan. Formal recognition oi: our control of foreign relations of Afghanistan lias been cardinal article of British policy for past 40 years, and you will appreciate reluctance of liis Majesty&apos;s Government to abandon principle to which they still attach great importance. Nevertheless they are not prepared in all the circumstances to risk breakdown of negotiations by maintaing -non possumus attitude on point of form if, as Your Excellency leads me to hope, substance can be secured by other means. His Majesty&apos;s Government wish to make it clear, however, that it seems to them impossible to contemplate renewal of subsidy on anything approaching former scale without securing in some way or another control of external relations, and they are disposed to think that some hint to this effect should be conveyed to Afghan delegates at present stage. With, this object 1 suggest, omission of final passage of Grants draft after words &quot;towards them and&apos;&apos;&apos; and substitution of following:-&quot; and his willingness to seek their advice will meet with a ready response on their part, and, moreover, will have an important influence on terms of subsequent treaty.&quot;I also hesitate to accept sentence in Grant&apos;s draft beginning: &quot;I have not therefore pressed,&quot; which seems open to criticism on two grounds, viz.,,(1) because word &quot; therefore &quot; seems to suggest that you are omitting from draft treaty, out of deference to Afghan susceptibilities, a provision which in fact was never included in it; and (2) because words &quot;entirely free&quot; seem to amount almost to an invitation to Afghan Government to enter into relations with other Powers. I should prefer to substitute sentence in following terms The treaty imposes no such restriction on Afghan Government.&quot;With the above suggestions,- which 1 do not press if Your Excellency sees strong objection, Grant is authorised to address delegates on lines proposed, without further reference to me.In thus assenting 1 assume that Afghans are ready, in return for proposed assurance, to agree to the draft treaty without demur, and 1 shall be reassured if they could also be induced by this assurance to agree at least in principle to the remaining stipulations which you have suggested to them as tests of good faith. *.
