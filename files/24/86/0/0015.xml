This Document la tho Property&apos; of    / J    h, . Hi&amp; Gi-UnnlMaj03ty&apos;6 Comment.  &apos;        (7TO.....tolJgT.The ffinajieial Situation. randum by the. Minister of Munitions,In referring to the Chancellor of the- ^oliequerrs aemorandum (G.T.7729) Dr. Addison stated in his paper (G.T.7830) during the past four years there has been an tmprec^dantec&apos;: &quot;provision of ships and other munitions for the Navy so that &quot;we find ourselves remarkably well provided,    The extent of &quot;that provision clearly affects the need of additional &quot;provision in the Immediate future&quot;,This remark does not apply only to the Admiralty, but also to the War Office, Air Ministry, and, indeed all consuming Departments.From what I have seen of tlie amount of surplus Government property thrown up by the various Departments for disposal, I am not satisfied that there are not considerable quantities of undeclared surplus stocks in existence.     I consider that the Cabinst should now appoint a Committee (similar to the Committee under Sir Francis ,Mo watt which laid down, some years ago, the reserve to be maintained of war-like stores) to determine what reserve stocks, Dot only of war-like stores, but of all other important supplies, &amp;ch Government Department should be allowed to keep;   and that each epartment should prepare and furnish to the Government schedules showing the quantity of- each commodity which is held in stock; the quantity still to be delivered against outstanding contracts;   and the quantity (if any) for which provision has been made in current stimates, and which it is intended shall be bought during the remainder of the financial year,    Against these should be set the uantity which is required during the currency of the present year, tod the quantity which the Department may, as the result of the CommitteeTs investigations,, be authorised to keep in reserve,    The lifference between the totals of the last two items and the irst three items should cease to be considered the property of
the Department concerned.   It should either be disposed of at once as surplus Government property, or. if that course is not considered advisable, should be held in reserve for subsequent disposal, or for issue to the Department coiicerned.,, or to any other Department requiring the same, against the supplies required by that Department in the Financial Year 1920-1921, or later years, in relief of the estimated provision for those years.I am satisfied that by the method suggested large economies might be effected.   The sale of surplus Government stocks tends to keep down prices and, in some commodities, to limit speculation, while the fear of the existence of undeclared surplus stocks,   hanging over markets, tends in many cases to prevent manufacturers from taking stops to increase production, and thus delays the decline in prioes to the detriment both of the public and of the Government in its capacity .of buyer and employer of labour.I think that in impressing economy on all Government Departments, attention should be. specially drawn to the possibility of effecting economies by substituting something vrhLfch is already in stock for the article which the purchasing Depart-, ment wishes to buy. .    In the present financial situation it may 1 even be desirable in many instances to make the &quot;second best&quot; ser^e &apos; the necessary purpose, to use an inferior article  which may bev in stock, rather than buy a new article which fits more exactly the high specifications as regards quality and finish which Government Departments have becomo   accustomed to call for.
