This is well illustrated by the amount of attention which this topic is evidently engaging among the working classes,, as judged by the number of protests which are being made with regard to it. Resolutions of protest against high prices and the high cost of living are being reported every day from Trade Unions, Trade Union branches, Trades Councils and other Labour organisations(C 1861) 255 8/19 H &amp; S Q

There is no doubt, however, that purchases are greater now than in 1918 for two reasons. First, so long as fighting was in progress the national need for economy appealed with greater force than it has done this year, and purchases were often limited to a minimum, with the result that expenditure was minimised. Secondly, the restriction of purchases in 1917 and 1918 could not be maintained indefinitely, and this year nearly everybody has found it necessary to replenish his depleted stocks of personal and household goods, with the result that his expenditure is much higher than last year. To many people, therefore, prices this year seem much higher than those last autumn, not because the price level has risen in the interval but because they did not realise how high prices were last year, since money corresponding to the advance in prices was not required to effect the restricted purchases, and since by economising in or abstaining from purchases many did not realise how much it would have cost them had they purchased more freely. It is well known, of course, that a considerable proportion of the workpeople, especially those in temporarily affluent circumstances, spent their money freely during the war, but with such persons the rise in prices was not felt or considered because of their full employment with high earnings. Now that earnings are reduced (e:g., through cessation of overtime or spells of unemployment, or less remunerative work) they feel the double effect Of high prices and reduced earnings.But these troubles are not peculiar to the United Kingdom. In France, Italy and Switzerland events have occurred which show that the high cost of living is possibly the most serious domestic factor with which the respective Governments have to contend ; and finally, from America, where this matter has been occupying a large amount of attention, reports have recently arrived as to industrial disturbance, actual and potential, especially on the railways, the main source of which appears to be the high cost of living. In these circumstances, since the relations, commercial and industrial, between the United States and this country are of a rather special nature, it may be worth while to attempt a comparison of wage levels in relation to the cost of living in the two countries.International comparisons of this kind are at all times risky unless based on investi-gatious carried out simultaneously on-parallel lines and under the guidance of competent statisticians in each of the countries considered. The risk of supplying misleading data is necessarily much greater now than ever before, owing to the rapid changes which the war has produced in the conditions of labour in all industrial countries. In no belligerent, country has it been possible to keep, much less to publish, accurate, complete and up-to-date records of these changes. The following table, however, has been prepared on the data available. It shows for the two countries the average earnings and hours in a full week excluding overtime for certain occupations in a number of selected industries,all over the country. Some important recent cases are referred to in Part IV of this Eeport.The most serious feature about this difficulty, however, is that there appears to be little prospect of any amelioration in the pear future, and the winter months will undoubtedly be very difficult. The increase in supplies which have been available this year has, paradoxical as it may seem, tended to aggravate the situation. While there is no doubt that prices of. food have declined, it is equally certain that expenditure on food has increased since the winter, because of the increased quantities of food which are being purchased. This is readily seen-by comparing the prices and the expenditure figures given in the &quot; Labour Gazette,&quot; which are as follows :

The American cotton wages shown in the Table are based upon a report issued last November by the &quot;Merchants&apos; National Bank of Boston.&quot; The authors of this Report, however impartial they may be in actual fact, might not unreasonably be regarded as capable of producing figures to support the employers&apos; standpoint. But even if it be assumed that the figures do really reflect the situation as it was last November in the American cotton industry, changes have since occurred both in wages and hours of labour of American textile operatives for which it is difficult to make accurate allowance in estimating present wages. In computing1 the wages given in the Table for American cotton operatives, however, an addition of 15 per cent, has been made to the figures supplied by the Report of the Merchants&apos; National Bank of Boston to cover these changes. In the case of the railway workers the figures supplied for the United States are based on a general Wage Order of the Director-General of American Railways, which took effect from the beginning of the present year, but which has only now been made accessible.The figures quoted in the Table for British cotton operatives and railway servants rest on a somewhat different basis. Those quoted for the cotton industry are based on. the average weekly earnings as shown by the 1906 Wages Enquiry plus the known per-centage increases on piece list prices since that date. In addition to these percentage increases, however, there have been adjustments of prices, allowances for cleaning, etc., the effect of which can only be roughly estimated. Although some allowance has been made for these minor increases, the figures as quoted are only approximate.  It should(C1861) x Q 2
also be noted that being averages they do not show the actual earnings, which vary in some *bases considerably within a range, of which the average given is about the mean. As regards the United Kingdom railways, the average is based on the figures contained in the Wages Enquiry Keport relating to 1907. The actual increases between that date and 1914 are not known, but estimates have been added, together with the known war wage of 335. per week. Here again the actual earnings vary widely, particularly in the case of ,guards, the figures quoted being an estimate of the average wages of both goods and passenger guards.From the foregoing it would seem that New York rates are higher than those of London by percentages ranging from 38 to 126. Taking the (unweighted) mean of the rates in the two cities, one finds that for a full week&apos;s work in New York a man is paid a wage about 85 per cent, higher than the corresponding London figure. The number of weekly hours required to earn the New York wage is moreover rather smaller than the corresponding number in London.But the cost of living is higher in the United States than in this country. Shortly before the war (in 1913) the relative cost of living (food and rent) in the two countries stood approximately as follows : United Kingdom.        United States.100 150Since then food prices have risen by about 110 per cent, in the United Kingdomand by 81 per cent, in the United States. The present position would therefore be approximatelyUnited Kingdom. United States.210 262which is the same asUnited Kingdom. United States.100 . 125But it appeared from the figures in the Table that money wages are now about 85 per cent, higher in New York than in London. If it could be assumed that the same ratio held good, not only for wages in certain typical trades in these two cities, but also for industry generally in the two countries, the following conclusion might legitimately be drawn: 	United	United	Kingdom.	States.Present money wages       ........................	100	185Present cost of living (food only)..................     ...	100	125Present real wages (i.e., food-purchasing power earned by full week&apos;s work)...	100	148There is no evidence, however, by which the above assumption could; be tested, - and the final conclusion must therefore be regarded as hypothetical.It seems not unlikely, however, that this real wage ratio (100 : 148) is somewhere near the truth, as will appear from the following calculation in which recourse must again be had to assumption. In this case, however, the assumption is the fairly reasonable one that in the United States as in this country the war time rise in money wages has just about kept pace with the war time rise in the cost of food, etc. The calculation is then as follows : 	Pre-War.		Present Day.		United Kingdom.	United States.	United Kingdom.	United States.Money wages       ...     ...... Cost of living (food)       ......	100 :   100	234 150	210* 210*	424f 272$* Pre-war figure (100) increased by 110 per cent.       f Pre-war figure (234) increased by 81 per cent.J Pre-war figure (150) increased by 81 per cent.
If each of the United Kingdom figures in the third column (210) be taken as equal to 100, then we get the following as representing the present position : United Kingdom.United States.Money wages Cost of living Real wages202 130 151The advantage which the American worker has now over the British worker in respect of real wages amounts to 48 per cent, on the one hypothesis and to 51 per cent, on the other, -and there would probably be no serious error in putting it at 50 per cent.  Before the war the American workers&apos; advantage was rather more than this, namely, 56 per cent.Part II. Demobilisation and Eesettlement.The Industrial Training of Disabled Men.The transfer to the Ministry of Labour of the powers of training exercised until early in the year by the Ministry of Pensions has necessarily been followed by a transitional period of reorganisation. The Ministry of Labour accepted all responsibility for the industrial training of disabled ex-Service men as from the 1st May. The necessary local arrangements for carrying out the plans of the Department could only be brought into full operation gradually, and it was necessary to postpone the transfer of the work of dealing with fresh applications un+il such time as the Divisional Directors of Training were prepared to take over the work. During this period, the length of which varied in &apos; different areas, the machinery instituted by the Ministry of Pensions continued in operation. The War Pensions Committees for the district were request ed to continue to deal with -applications and to submit to the Headquarters of the Ministry of Labour training schemes for which they required sanction. The final step in the transference of this work has now, however, been taken. On the 1st August, the local training authorities took over from the Ministry of Pensions the financial arrangements for the payment of all allowances to disabled ex-Service men in training. This step, which it was necessary to postpone from the 1st July, the date originally fixed, may therefore be taken as marking formally the end of the transition period.In view of the fact that the question of employment after training is as important as the actual training itself and that the trained man&apos;s opportunities depend very largely on local opinion and sympathy, it was obviously desirable to maintain, so far as possible, continuity with the work carried on by the Ministry of Pensions. This policy has been carried out with success. Associated with the Divisional Directors of Industrial Training for example, are the Divisional Training Councils, which generally contain representatives of the local Employment Committees, Pensions Committees and Education Authorities in the area. These have replaced, in many instances, the Joint Disablement Training Com-mittees which had been set up in a number of districts by the Ministry of Pensions, in order to co-ordinate the work of the local War Pensions Committees, and especially to deal with cases where, owing to the lack of training facilities, a War Pensions Committee wished to send a man for training outside the district with which, they were concerned. But the change has in many cases been little more than a change of name, the Joint Disablement Training Committees being re-constituted as Divisional Training Councils. Again, as regards the trades declared to be Special Trades for the purpose of Instruction 23 issued under Article 6 of the Koyal Warrant of March, 1917, the functions allotted to the National Trade Advisory Committees, representative of employers and employed, which were called upon to report on the openings suitable for disabled men and the training necessary to fit them for such employment, have been maintained unchanged, as have also the powers of the Local Technical Advisory Committees attached to Exchanges in whose area training under the terms of these reports is proceeding, to supervise locally the selection of applicants and the courses of training provided. Close co-operation with the National Trade Advisory Committees and Local Technical Advisory Committees is essential in the Special Trades, since it is mainly upon the attitude of these bodies that the opportunity of placing men after training depends. At the same time this provision necessarily involves some delay in the immediate application of training schemes.  When, for example, it is desired by
the Divisional Director of Training to arrange new courses of instruction at institutions where a course has already been sanctioned, the course must conform with the special instructions embodied in the report of the National Trade Advisory Committee on openings in the industry in question, and the agreement of the Local Technical Advisory Committee is also necessary. In areas where the report for the industry concerned contemplates the provision of training but where no scheme has yet been approved, or in cases where it is desired to set up a course in one of the special trades in an area which is not named in the report, a scheme has to be submitted to Headquarters in order that the approval of the National Trade Advisory Committee may if necessary be obtained, and the requisite Local Technical Advisory Committee set up. Moreover, even where training in a trade other than the special trades is under contemplation, the same considerations of local interest and outlook apply. It has been found expedient, and indeed essential, that the advice of employers and employed in the trade and locality concerned should be obtained. It has therefore been impossible to expand the number of training courses suddenly, if only on this account.A very real hindrance to reasonably rapid progress and development is the serious shortage in facilities for training a difficulty which is enhanced by the cumbrous nature of the procedure which-has to be followed in order to secure adequate accommodation and equipment for any of the more comprehensive schemes. As things stand to-day, it must be acknowledged that the existing provision is quite inadequate when compared with the number of men requiring and willing to be trained. In nearly every area plans have now been laid for setting up training institutions and schemes on something like an adequate scale, but this policy involves the acquisition of National and other factories and the initiation of negotiations with other departments, which have a tendency to become unduly protracted. The consequent delays are not merely vexatious in them-selves, but are not an inconsiderable factor in causing that unrest among men of the class for whose benefit the Department exists, of which there have been all too many manifesta-tions recently. In this connection it has to be recognised that the training of the disabled man for re-entry into industrial life is a war emergency problem and should be treated as such. The general work of preliminary organisation is, however, now over, and both as regards the number of schemes of training, their comprehensive character, and the facilities for carrying them out, a gradual improvement in the situation is being effected. The training may be given in technical institutions, in the works of private firms, or, as was the case with training in munition work under the Ministry of Munitions, in Government instructional factories. The transfer of the Labour Depart-ments of the Ministry of Munitions to the Ministry of Labour, made available a number of these latter institutions, in several of which training has been recommenced under the Ministry of Labour. The idea of the instructional factory has evidently made a good impression and many of the most recent training schemes submitted for approval provide for instruction in institutions of this type. In the details of organisation, the Divisional Directors have been given a very free hand, in order to make due allowance for local circumstances. The point may be illustrated as regards the selection of candidates for training. In the West Midlands area, the applicants sent forward by the War Pensions Committees or the Joint Sub-Committees formed by the War Pensions Committees and Local Employment Committees are referred to an interviewing committee composed of representatives of employers and workmen in the various industries, and also of the Local Technical Advisory Committees whose approval is thus secured, when necessary, without the need for a separate application. This system has worked with great success, as many of the employers on the Committee have been willing to provide training in their own works and subsequently to provide employment. In London on the other hand, the Joint Sub-Committees of War Pensions and Local Employment Committees deal with the preliminary interviews, and applicants are then interviewed by a trade expert, and finally referred, where necessary, to the Local Technical Advisory Committee.On the 6th. August, 9,933 men were in training under the Ministry of Labour, and 20,501 had been admitted to training courses. This excludes those at Lord Roberts&apos; Workshops where 566 are under training and 1,789 have been admitted to training, and those receiving curative training under the Ministry of Pensions at St. Dunstan&apos;s, where 690 were in training on the 16th July and 1,390 had been admitted. It excludes also the 5,981 disabled men trained before the beginning of March under the Ministry of Munitions.The list of occupations is long, and the numbers in training for the most part are not large. The most promineno occupations are boot and shoe making and repairing, in which about 1,550 men are in training, and mechanical engineering, which accounts for about 1,400. About 1,350 men are training for commercial work and 440 in furniture making. In most other cases the number does not exceed 100 and in many is less than ten.
113Part III.-Press Comments.(1) Labour and Socialist Press. (A) Imperial and Foreign Affairs.Russia.Mr. M. Philips Price concludes in the &quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; the quasi-historical articles which he has been writing under the title of &quot; The Truth about Russia.&quot; This week he completes his narrative by making three assertions and then proceeds to outline the Soviet system, &quot; as it exists in Russia to-day.&quot; The first of his assertions is the common one that the Allied Governments have done real service to Bolshevism by reversing in the territories they have occupied the Bolshevist policy. This he alleges they have done in three ways. They have allowed the &quot; feudal landlords &quot;. to return and re-assume the position they held under the Czar&apos;s tyranny, they have restored the &quot; free sale and speculation-lation in land/&apos; and they have broken up or rendered powerless Labour organisations. His second assertion is also an old one, that in February or March this year &quot; Prussian Junkers&apos; volunteer corps&quot; received the protection of the British fleet in carrying on operations against the Bolsheviks. His third assertion is new, that the local Bolshevik armies &quot; in the Ukraine, the Don and the Baltic Provinces &quot; are spontaneous indigenous eruptions, and that the Governments which depend on these armies are &quot; quite independent of Moscow,&quot; being merely &quot; in federation with &quot; the Bolshevik Government there. Mr. Price&apos;s description of the Soviet Government &quot;... as it exists to-day &quot; is of no greater intrinsic value than his history. He mentions vaguely two central institutions in addition to the All-Russia Congress of Soviets, namely the All-Russia Union of Professional Alliances (which in another place he names the &quot; Central All-Russia Professional Alliance) and a Central Council of Public Economy. He is not clear as to the constitution or functions of the latter body, but he regards the former (which he says is a federation of workers&apos; com-mittees grouped according to industries, whereas the All-Russia Congress is a federation of these committees grouped according to towns and districts), as a body of greater potential importance than the political Congress, to the position and authority of which he thinks it will succeed when Bolshevik Russia is secure from external foes. Mr. Price then proceeds to compare this &quot; Soviet System &quot; with &quot; Democracy.&quot; He prefers the Soviet System, which is very natural in view of his opinions that &quot; the democratic election to a Parliament is nothing more than a device to deceive the workers by dividing them into artificial constituencies on the basis of which they cannot possibly unite and draw up a common social and economic policy,&quot; and that the greatest, and apparently he thinks a peculiar, advantage of a Soviet is that &quot; it is capable of being continually re-elected.&quot;* In &quot;Justice&quot; Mr..K. E. Prymus-Nyman inveighs against the Bolshevik rule, and calls upon the Allied Governments to send to Russia hundreds of thousands of men so that they may &quot; control the feelings of those who are thirsting for revenge.&quot; He affirms his belief, &quot; that only in the shadow of Allied bayonets can there be fair play during the elections to the coming Russian Parliament.&quot; &quot;The Call&quot; congratulates Soviet Russia on its magnificent fight against overwhelming odds and expresses its conviction that the only thing which restrains the Allied Governments from throwing the whole weight of inter-national militarism into the struggle is their uncertainty as to what will be the attitude of Labour. This paper appeals to the members of the Triple Alliance to dispel all doubts by a clear pronouncement in favour of a strike to stop intervention in Russia. The &quot; Nation &quot; and the &quot; New Statesman &quot; both regard the speech of the Secretary of State for War in the House of Commons on the 29th July as showing the influence of the Both-well (Lanarkshire) by-election result. These papers, too, comment favourably on Mr. Asquith&apos;s speech at Edgware on the 26th July, and suggest that his belief in a policy of non-intervention in Russia is shared by a vast majority of the electorate. The &quot; British Citizen &quot; thinks it is idle to ignore the fact that &quot; the Bolshevists are to a large extent Germany&apos;s catspaws,&quot; and holds that it would be most regrettable if the murder of some of our officers by mutinous Russian soldiers should lead to any hasty action in the direction of withdrawing our troops from Russia.*Hungary.Colonel Wedgwood, M.P., who has just returned from a short visit to Hungary, contributes to &quot; Forward &quot; an article entitled, &quot; Marxism in Hungary.&quot; In this article he gives his first impressions of Hungary before his interviews with the leaders of the* Of. $78 of the Fundamental Law. (10th July, 1918) of the Russian Soviet Republic.119
Revolution in Budapest. He testifies to there being complete order under the Revolution-He contrasts the Hungarian policy of State ownership of land with the policy adopted in Russia of&quot; giving the land to the peasants.&quot; The strength of the revolution seemed to him to lie in Budapest, but even there he thought that the revolution was only maintained by force and terror. He regards the Revolution as a crude experiment in Marxian Social-ism but, apparently, he saves his more interesting remarks for the second instalment of his article. Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; attacks the Allied policy towards Bela Kun, and maintains that his Government came into power with the consent of all parties, and that &quot; there is no evidence that any other Government would be more representative.&quot;General Smuts.General Smuts&apos; farewell message is discussed in &quot;Forward&quot; by Mr. E. D. Morel. He describes the document not only as an appeal to the best instincts of our people, but as a rebuke to the policy pursued by the Allied and Associated Powers at Paris. He disputes;, however, General Smuts&apos; thesis that &quot; the fundamental significance of the war has been the victory of the spirit, of the moral over the material factors in life,&quot; and suggests that it is precisely because its fundamental significance is not what General Smuts asserts it to be that he felt the need of issuing his appeal. He then develops in. detail his view that the war was merely a struggle between rival &quot; Imperialisms,&quot; and suggests it is because so many people have shared General Smuts&apos; faith that the reaction. caused by the doings of the Paris Conference has been so strong. He expresses the opinion. that the brutalities inflicted by certain German military commanders upon individuals are as nothing compared with &quot; the monstrous policy of destroying human life by starvation and disease after the armistice.&quot; He thinks that the fact &quot; that General Smuts preaches from a text which is not true does much to neutralise the good that his message might otherwise accomplish.&quot; The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; prints the final paragraph of General Smuts&apos; message in such a way as to show that it regards this paragraph as a suitable text for Socialists to learn.Canada.The &quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; reviews a series of issues of the &quot;Western Labour News,&quot; which acted as the official organ of the Winnipeg strikers. Its discovery from these papers that the Winnipeg strike committee did not call itself a Soviet disappoints this journal, but this disappointment is balanced by its pleasure in being able to accuse the English &quot;capitalist&quot; press of misrepresenting the strikers as revolutionaries. In the view of the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; the strikers claimed increased wages in order to cover the increased cost of living and the right of &quot; collective bargaining,&quot; which in this case meant &quot; the right of unions in an industry to form themselves into a council, and to conduct negotiations through that council.&quot; Particular examples of such &quot; Trades Councils &quot; are quoted in the metal and building industries. This &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; review is to be completed next week.Other.The &quot; Nation &quot; discusses in a critical spirit the articles of the Peace Treaty which deal with the principles under which mandatory Powers are to administer the territories entrusted to them.* Mr. W. McLaine, in &quot;The Call,&quot; deals with a similar subject, and, in particular, objects to the reported &quot; gift to Belgium of the provinces of Ruanda and Urundi, in the north-west of German East Africa.&quot; He alleges that the Prime Minister pledged that the natives of &quot; Central Africa &quot; should be consulted &quot; through their tribal organisations and through their chiefs, and given an opportunity of deciding for themselves whether they preferred German or any other rule,&quot; whereas the &quot; Nation &quot;&apos; only suggests that this was promised, &quot; so far as might be practicable.&quot; Mr. McLaine also makes the assertion that Britain exercised &quot; suzerainty &quot; over Egypt before the*war, and since the war has &quot;annexed&quot; that country. In view of the Lucerne meeting of the Second (Berne) International, the Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; publishes from the Swiss journal, &quot; L&apos;Avenire del Lavoratore,&quot; the resolution of the Moscow International, which sums up the opinion this body has of the Berne organisation. This document roundly abuses the second International, describing it as a &quot; yellow International&quot; and its members as &quot;lackeys of the bourgeoisie.&quot; The &quot;Labour Leader &quot; protests against the alleged action of the Allies in disposing of their surplus munitions of war to the newly created states in Eastern and Central Europe, and the point of its protest is: &quot; Shipping, railways, and men and labour are extensively employed in.* $$22 and 23 of the Covenant of the League of Nations.
(B) Home Affairs.Direct Action.Approval of the suggested &quot; direct action &quot; of the Triple Alliance has been connected with a desire for an early General Election in the writings of the majority of the contributors to the I.L.P. papers.  Such an event, therefore,&quot; as the Bothwell (Lanarkshire) by-election result must have an influence on their opinions on the matter of &quot; direct action.&quot;  The &quot; New Statesman,&quot; however, is the only paper which directly correlates this by-election result with &quot; direct action.&quot;  This paper, after stating that after BothwelTthere can be no plausible justification or excuse for refusing a fresh appeal to the electorate at the earliest opportunity, asks &quot; who, if the Government refuses a dissolution, will be able to condemn c direct action,&apos; when the Constitutional&apos; alternative has become a palpable farce.&quot; The &quot; Leeds Weekly Citizen &quot; rejoices in the result and suggests that &quot; the Government is subsisting only by a process of spoonfeeding the press with inspired notes and news.&quot; The Merthyr &quot;Pioneer &quot; considers the Secretary of State for War&apos;s speech in the House of Commons on the 29th July and argues that it signifies a definite change in policy on the part of the Government due to the demonstrations on the 20th and 21st July, and still more to the &quot; drastic action of the Triple Alliance &quot; on the 23rd July.  This paper, however, warns the workers that their vigilance must not cease until the soldiers are actually home again from Kussia, and that at all times during the interval they must be prepared to threaten the exercise of their power of blockade to force the Government into fulfilment of its pledges. In another article the same paper, after suggesting that it is for the executives . of the Triple Alliance to decide whether a ballot on &quot; direct action &quot; is now necessary or not, gives references to the history of International Socialism which go to show that the general strike for political purposes has only been rejected hitherto as a regular Socialist weapon because of difficulties of organisation.  Examples of successful Belgian and Swedish general strikes to secure suffrage reforms are mentioned, and it is argued that the political situation justifies, and the organisation of the Triple Alliance makes possible, the resort to &quot; direct action&quot; here now in the United Kingdom.  The &quot;Nation&quot; suggests that&apos;the Russian policy of the Government has been altered because of the inherent difficulties of the policy of direct intervention, but maintains that the policy which it believes has now been adopted by the Government, one of subsidies and blockade, is equally objectionable, and suggests that so long as this policy continues, &quot; so long will the challenge of a visible class war disturb the minds of our workers at home.&quot;  The &quot; Nation &quot; calls for &quot; an instant liquidation of the whole adventure &quot; for the sake of peace at home.  The &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; tends to support the contention of the Merthyr &quot; Pioneer &quot;that the threat of &quot; direct action &quot; on the part of the Triple Alliance has caused a change in policy, though this paper does not omit to refer to the recent by-elections.  On the subject of &quot; direct action &quot; generally, Mr. Philip Snowden in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; gives something of a warning.  &quot; Only a case of exceptional strength and importance can justify the course which has been recom-mended.&quot;  &quot; Direct action,&quot; he thinks, depends for its success on the rarity of the occasions upon which it is used.  He expresses the opinion that the question of making &quot; direct action &quot; a recognised method of securing political objects is not the question at issue, and that, if it were, many who favour &quot; direct action &quot; now for the specific purpose in view would take a different attitude.  Mr. Victor Lantern contributes to &quot; The Call &quot; an appeal to the rank and file of the Triple Alliance.  His appeal goes beyond the stated questions at issue. He asks the members of the Triple Alliance to think of all that has transpired since the commencement of the war rising prices outdistancing any increase in wages, the sacrifices the war demanded from men, women and children, the food queues, conscrip-tion and asks them what they have profited from the war.  This would appear to be the main ground of his appeal to them to use their power (he assures them they have the power) to prevent &quot; the further butchery of their friends and relations in Russia.&quot;  He asks them to &quot; raise the Red Flag to use their industrial might, not only to destroy the power of the capitalist ruling class to indulge in blood-baths, but to abolish capitalism.&quot;  The Woolwich(c 1861)Rthis trade of supplying munitions, while Europe is starving.&quot; In &quot; Forward &quot; Mr. J. T. Walton Newbold turns from his enquiry into Scottish Capitalism to a discussion of the difficulties into which the U.S.A. loans to European countries may plunge America, and concludes that Capitalism is &quot;in extremis,&quot; and is, indeed, approaching the &quot; Universal Catastrophe.&quot; His advice is : &quot; Let Labour concentrate upon the necessary work of preparing itself to take over control of the means of production and distribution, and to direct these to the supply of the needs of the working community.&quot;
Pioneer &quot; indulges in an attack upon the Prime Minister-using for this purpose Lord Askwith&apos;s letter to &quot; The Times &quot; published on 30th July, and suggests that a system of government that winks at profiteering, and thus necessitates demands for increased wages which involve industrial disputes, has been created in order that &quot;when he gets the cue at the appointed time in each dispute he may jump in and announce I have settled the dispute.&quot; This alleged policy, in the opinion of this paper, further strengthens the claim for the workers that they have a right to exercise their industrial influence in national politics. In another article, &quot; The Call &quot; suggests that it is necessary to overhaul- and strengthen the strike as a weapon in the class war. The policy, this paper recommends is 1 o make -strikes popular with the public, and, as an example, the question is asked, &quot; Why should not a train, bus, or tram strike mean free rides for the public ? &quot; Mr. Thomas Kennedy, in &quot; Justice,&quot; attacks the I.L.P. and asks, &quot; Is the Labour Party to degenerate to the position of a mere machine for the carrying on of a war of revenge by Mr. Macdonald and, others on their old constituents ? &quot; The &quot; Clarion &quot; looks to Mr. J. H. Thomas to guide the Parliamentary Labour Party to a clearer definition of its industrial policy; compliments this party on possessing many able members and compares them favourably with the Government and its &quot; shilly-shally wobbling.&quot; Mr. William Miles contributes to the &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; (which paper is now under the editorship of Mr. F. W. Jowett) an article in which he advocates as a means of preventing revolution a scheme under which 20 per cent, of the national income should be pooled and distributed equally over the whole of the population at a flat rate estimated at 9s. per head per week. The &quot; British Citizen &quot; calls for the establishment of a representative &quot; grand commission &quot; to think out thoroughly the whole question of the causes and cure for industrial unrest.Coal Industry.&quot; Rob Roy,&quot; in &quot; Forward,&quot; warns the miners that it is their duty to keep the path open for nationalisation, and expresses his opinion that a strike policy will not conduce to this. In the opinion of a contributor to the &quot; Merthyr Pioneer,&quot; control by the workers of the coal industry is the only thing that can remove the suspicion, the delays, and the industrial warfare which are now hampering production. He praises a pamphlet entitled &quot; Industrial Democracy in the Mining Industry,&quot; which he describes as a sequel to the &quot; Miners&apos; Next Step,&quot; and which he announces is to be issued at the end of this month. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; complains that at present only a minority of the miners has adopted &quot; the rank and file scheme for socialising the industry,&quot; while the others have accepted the Sankey proposals, &quot; which in practice will prove almost worthless.&quot; A further complaint is made that the miners have not yet proved that they will actually strike for nationalisation, and a fear is expressed that the &quot; miners&apos; charter &quot; will be indefinitely postponed unless the &quot; revolutionary sections &quot; of the rank and file are prepared to act. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; reviews the whole problem of coal nationalisation, and promises that nationalisation of such vital services as mining, railways and electricity, is to be the leading domestic issue of the near future. This paper again criticises Mr. Bonar Law&apos;s reply to Sir Henry Dalziel in the House of Commons on the 23rd July as to the real issue on which the coal strikes were taking place. His statement is described as &quot; an elaborate statement, every word of which is deliberately false.&quot; From the space the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; devotes to the questions at issue in the coal industry it is obvious that this paper regards these questions as test questions which are likely soon to exceed in importance the question of intervention in Russia. Sir Leo Chiozza Money, in an article entitled &quot; The New &apos; Scrap of Paper&apos;,&quot; defends the Sankey Report, and alleges that there is a conspiracy on foot to persuade the Government to &quot; repudiate its pledges to the miners.&quot; In another article it is urged that the recently announced increase in the price of coal is evidence of a &quot; Government conspiracy to foul the miners and secure the profiteers.&quot; In a leading article it is suggested that the action of the Government upon the coal question is attributable to sheer incapacity or else to a deliberate design to foment revolt. The six-shilling increase is described as unnecessary, as inexcusable, and as a deliberate aggrava-tion of a position known to be delicate. The handling of the Yorkshire strike is described as &quot; fatuous.&quot; The opinion is expressed that the coal question is going to dominate the political and industrial field for a long time to come, but the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; is confident that the miners will eventually win. This week the &quot; New Age &quot; considers Sir Arthur Duckham&apos;s report on the coal industry, and declares his scheme to be even worse than the nationalisation scheme recommended by Mr. Justice Sankey. This paper, however, fears that it is now too late to get a hearing for a third alternative favoured by itself, and therefore refrains from outlining this alternative.
117   &apos; - 121The &quot; Nation &quot; discusses the causes which account for the refusal of prices to lower themselves much below the war level, and prescribes as remedies increased production, a gradual deflation of the currency together with the cancelling of about two thousand millions of the debt by a levy on the profits of &quot; war-profiteering,&quot; and a &quot; regulation of the pay-ments taken by capital and labour at critical points in the processes of production and distribution.&quot; These last two remedies require Government action, and the &quot; Nation &quot; affirms that the present Government cannot be trusted to apply either of them. This paper calls, therefore, for a coalition of the best men of all parties, including the Labour Party, in order that Labour may share the responsibility for government and industry. Mr. H. Tiddiman, in the &quot; Democrat,&quot; deals with profiteering rather than with prices, and states that popular indignation against this &quot; national evil&quot; is steadily increasing! Mr. R. B. Suthers, in the &quot; Clarion,&quot; advocates a State Bank on the lines of the Australian Commonwealth Bank. In this paper, also, Mr. S. Howard Withey advocates the formation of military cadet corps in conjunction with all schools for boys over 14. In &quot; Forward,&quot; Mr. J. K. Murray deals with the fate of the landed property of the Scottish Church at the time of the Reformation, and concludes his series of articles by the assertion that he is clearly right in maintaining that all the land in Scotland should be returned to the Crown, as trustee for the public.(2) The Press on Demobilisation and Resettlement.Demobilised Men.The &quot; Labour Leader&quot; contains an article bitterly condemning the attitude of employers towards demobilised men seeking work. The employers in many cases are said to be offering these men pre-war wages, alleging that they have &quot; lost touch with the trade,&quot; or that their industrial capacity has deteriorated. As a contrast to the con-ditions of work offered to demobilised men, the record war profits of several firms are quoted. Such a state of affairs, the article concludes, is driving the workers to realise that the capitalist system is at fault, and that what they need is to secure control of the industrial and political machinery of the country. On the other hand, the &quot; British Citizen &quot; finds the arrangements for the employment of disabled soldiers to be &quot; extremely satisfactory.&quot;Unemployment Donation Pay.The &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; contains two articles protesting against the decision of the umpire in not granting out-of-work donation to the weavers and cardroom workers who, after the recent dispute, were willing to resume work a fortnight before the spinners would give in. The paper contends that they should have received the donation for these two weeks, being unemployed owing to a separate dispute concerning spinners only.Apprentices.A Leeds contractor informed the &quot; Yorkshire Post&quot; (29th ult.), that apprentices in the building trade have been returned from the army in a proportion which does not constitute an especial grievance. It was found, however, that if they had been away from their civilian employment for a few years they were disinclined to resume their former status on being demobilised. Many of them demanded to be treated as journeymen in the matter of wages, while in some cases the firms to which they were indentured had granted special rates of pay in view of the abnormal circumstances. At the same time there was so general a scarcity of apprentices as to create uncertainty for the future of the industry, arising from the refusal of youths to be indentured for the requisite period of apprentice-ship. Negotiations had been in progress for some time past with the object of formulating, a scheme which would offer greater inducements, but an agreement had not yet been. reached.(C 1861)R2
Part IV-General Topics and District Reports. (1) General Topics.Direct Action.. There are signs that the &quot; direct action &quot; issue is leading to a sharp cleavage of opinion in the Labour world. To what extent the rank and file of the Triple Alliance approve of the policy will not be known till the result of the ballot is announced. The results of the ballot are to be supplied to the respective organisations by 25th August. The Parliamentary Labour Party has declined to commit itself to any definite attitude on the matter. On the 31st July, it met and discussed a motion by Mr. .R H. Rose, calling upon the Party definitely to dissociate itself from the propaganda taking place in favour of direct action. The meeting, at which it is reported neither Mr. Clynes nor Mr. Adamson were present, came to no decision on the issue, and adjourned the consideration of the matter sine die. The policy of direct action continues to be vigorously advocated by the &quot; Daily Herald,&quot; and it is worth noting that on the 31st July it published an announcement on the relations of Labour and the Press, signed by the president of the N.U.R. and the secretaries of the M.F.G.B. and the Transport Workers&apos; Federation. This states that the most effective form of political action is the expression of real public opinion, and that the working class in general and the organised workers in particular derive more advantage from a clear and unprejudiced presentation of their claims and aspirations by and through a Labour daily newspaper than by costly strikes and wage movements. Therefore these three Triple Alliance leaders exhort all trade unionists of every school of thought to support the &quot;Daily Herald &quot; as an additional form of political action.Industrial Unrest.The recent series of strikes, while quite susceptible of explanation as isolated products of genuine industrial disputes, suggest a deliberate, though completely unsuccessful, attempt at co-ordination and exploitation by extremist elements in the background. The Bank Holiday week-end might well have appeared to agitators to constitute a favourable opportunity to cause the smouldering embers of industrial dispeace to flare up. In the first place, the whole industrial and political situation was overcast by the threat of the Triple Alliance, and the members of its three constituent bodies were exercised by the problem of casting their votes for or against the policy of direct action. Further, the situation was affected by the miners&apos; strike, discontinued largely under protest in certain districts and still unsettled in Yorkshire, and by the immineut culmination of another dispute of long standing which intimately touched the whole life of the country, namely the trouble in the baking trade. The general spirit of discontent, caused largely by exasperation at the cost of living, provided an excellent soil for the germination of the seeds of trouble. In the circumstances the police strike, deliberately and secretly organised by agitators in the Police Union, was sprung upon the country, and was followed by the riots in Liverpool and the &quot; sympathetic strike &quot; of L. &amp; S.W. railwaymen and others. There can be little doubt that if the police strike had succeeded, the events which occurred in Liverpool would have taken place elsewhere also, and that extremists in various branches of industry might have attempted to call sympathetic strikes on a large scale. It is not intended to maintain that there was necessarily a causal connection between all the strikes and events that have been mentioned, but it is probable that their co-existence at this particular time was not purely fortuitous.Nationalisation and the Coal Situation.Though during the past week the problem of nationalisation has been thrown tem-temporarily into the background, a large number of resolutions on the subject continue to be reported from various Labour and other organisations. Mansfield and New Cross branches of the National Union of Railwaymen have passed resolutions in favour of the^nationalisa-tion of the coal mines, and in protest against the increase in the price of coal. The nationalisation of the mines has also been advocated by the Hornsey Trades Council, and further protests against the increase in the price of coal have been registered by the Maidstone Trade and Labour Council, the Liverpool and District Railwaymen&apos;s Vigilance Committee and the &quot; Alma &quot; Lodge of the Durham Miners&apos; Association.  On the other
119 -      I bhand, the Institution of Mining and Metallurgy has forwarded resolutions to the Prime Minister indicating that this body views with grave concern the serious diminution in production and increase in the cost of British coal, and considers that the evidence given before the Coal Industry Commission has failed to establish the necessity or expediency of nationalisation of the industry, and that the Institution is strongly opposed to the State - ownership of the coal industry though it is willing to acquiesce in the recommendation for the acquisition by the State of coal royalties. At a meeting of miners at Gilfach Goch, Rhymney Valley, a resolution was passed unanimously protesting against the proposed nationalisation of mines.  It is not reported what alternative was intended.The Supreme Economic Council of the Allies and Associates at its meetings in London on the 1st and 2nd instant held that the general situation in respect of coal production was one of the1 utmost gravity. The memorandum by the Director-General of Relief showed that coal production in Europe had fallen to a dangerously low figure as compared with that of pre-war production.Colliery surface workers. .     *On the 30th July the Coal Controller and Sir Richard Redmayne met in a joint Conference representatives of the Mining Association of Great Britain and the National Council of Mine Workers Other than Miners with regard to overtime rates, payment for hours to be worked over 46^ by shift men, and the hours of underground workers other than miners. After examining the facts of the case the Coal Controller pointed out that the questions in dispute were matters which must be dealt with by the Minister of Labour, and the Conference separated on the understanding that an early meeting at the Ministry of Labour would be arranged. These demands, it may be recalled, have been the subject of negotiation ever since the first Report of the Coal Commission was issued. Some 20,000 pivotal men, including colliery enginemen, firemen and mechanics, are involved in the points at issue in these negotiations, and the areas affected comprise Lancashire, Yorkshire, the whole of the Midlands, and North and South Wales. On the 31st July the Minister of Labour and the Coal Controller met the representatives of the National Council of Mine Workers, and satisfactory progress was made towards a settlement of the issue. Further negotiations are taking place between the Ministry and the various interests involved.Miners and Overtime.The question of overtime pay for continuous week-end shifts was considered at a joint conference on the 29th July of representatives of the Miners&apos; Federation and the National Federation of Colliery Enginemen and Firemen, with Sir Richard Redmayne. It was contended on behalf of the men that overtime should be paid for at the rate of time and a half, with double time for Sunday work. The question was adjourned to enable the Federation to formulate a national policy in consultation with the owners and the Coal Controller.Engineering.The delegate meeting of the A.S.E., which has been sitting in Manchester since Whit Monday, has now brought its deliberations to a close. Several important decisions have been reached. An attempt is to be made to control the working conditions of the apprentice member^ of the society, and it is proposed to fix the number of apprentices at not more than one to three journeymen. Shop stewards are to be accorded direct representation on the District Committee in the proportion of one steward to every 10,000 members ; the stewards&apos; representatives to be elected by their fellow-stewards and to be responsible to them. The number of organisers is to be increased from 13 to 25, two of whom are to be national organisers. Provisions are made in the revised rules for the calling of special national conferences of the district representatives of the rank and file and for. an annual meeting of delegates for the purpose of reviewing agreements with employers and initiating new policies. In future Parliamentary candidates will be run on the basis of one to every 15,000 members instead of one to every 10,000 as heretofore. It is important to note that the meeting decided against the admittance of women to the society on the ground that the occupations covered by it are not generally suited to women and that no safeguard would be likely to prevent a lower standard of wages being paid to women. The resolution with regard to payment by results was dealt with in last week&apos;s Report.
Railway Clerks.There is reported to be much unrest among railway clerks owing to the protracted! nature of the negotiations which have been talcing place between the Railway Clerks&apos; Association, and the Railway Executive Committee regarding the national programme which was submitted by the Association last January. During the past week several branches have held mass meetings at which the calling of a special conference was demanded with a view to taking drastic action if necessary. In Lancashire an unauthorised stoppage was threatened for last week-end, and it was with difficulty prevented by the officials of the Association.Bricklayers.The Executive of the Operative Bricklayers&apos; Society, following representations from the nine divisions of the Union, has drawn up an important national programme. This includes (1) a national flat rate of wages; (2) a standard code of working rules, which will be submitted to the annual conference of the National Building Trades Federation, with a view to its adoption by the whole of the building trades; (3) the abolition of systematic overtime; and (4) the refusal to permit dilution until all the unemployed are absorbed and all who are anxious for release from the Army are demobilised. The Executive views with suspicion Government plans for setting up schools, in connection with the housing schemes, for training demobilised officers as superintendents, managers, &amp;c, and demobilised men as mechanics ; and it has decided to institute an enquiry into the whole matter.&quot; Profiteering.&quot;There is evidence of growing exasperation at the continuance of the high prices of&quot; food and clothing. Many branches of Trade Unions have passed resolutions of protest, and there can be no doubt that in most of the recent industrial disputes the high cost of living has been an underlying cause of trouble. As an example of the resolutions which are being passed by Tradp Union branches may be noted that of the Taunton branch of the N.U.R., which requested their Executive to call a conference of the Triple Alliance with the object of bringing pressure to bear on the Government to secure cheaper living. Protests against profiteering are reported from Labour organisations in Bradford, Sheffield, and many other provincial towns, and Labour leaders all over the country have been protesting on behalf of their Unions, at public meetings and in the Press. Such protests have been made by Mr. J. H. Thomas, General Secretary of the N.U.R., Mr. J. R. Clynes, Mr. C. T. Cramp, President of the N.U.R., Mr. W. Straker, Northumberland Miners&apos; Association, Mr. George Milligan, Deputy General Secretary of the Dockers&apos; Union, Mr. George Nielson, President of the Plymouth Trade and Labour Council, and many others. The example of Ilford in setting up a street market to sell at a reasonable price greengroceries, fish and poultry, seems likely to be followed by other centres.Ex-Service Men.It is reported that arrangements were made by the representatives of the Federation&apos;, of Discharged and Demobilised Soldiers and Sailors and of Labour and Socialist organisa-tions in Glasgow for a protest demonstration on the occasion of the Glasgow Official Peace Celebrations on the 4th August. The demonstrators proposed to muster in military formation, each section in charge of a marshal, and proceed through some of the principal streets to Fleshers&apos; Haugh, where a commemorative service for the dead would take place. Ex-Service men also agreed to boycott a dinner and entertainment arranged by the Corporation in their honour. After these preparations for demonstration had been made, the Glasgow District Council of the Federation met, and intimated that it would take no official part either in the official peace celebrations or in the proposed counter-demonstrations, and that members of the Federation were at liberty to take part in. either function.Disabled Men.A meeting of the Committee of both Houses of Parliament interested in the employ-ment of disabled men on the lines of the Rothband scheme was held on the 29th July,-, when Sir Robert Horne dealt with some suggestions of the Committee in regard to the
&quot;Governments proposals. It was explained that the Rothband scheme of a national roll of employers willing to employ disabled men would be adopted.in principle, but would be subject to modifications and additions.Amalgamation.An amalgamation has taken place between the Natidnal Society of Pottery Workers, the United Ovenmen&apos;s Society and the United Packers&apos; Association, and the total member-ship of the new body is said to be about 40,000. This fusion has been anticipated since the last series of negotiations with the manufacturers a few months ago, when the three unions acted in concert, and the advantages of combination were so obvious as to render -amalgamation a foregone conclusion. This amalgamation, it is interesting to ,notice, -follows closely upon the formation of the British Pottery Manufacturers&apos; Federation..New Unions.A National Society of Divers and Linesmen has been formed, and has presented to Liverpool employers new wages&apos; claims.Nottingham Warehouse clerks have decided to form a union to be affiliated to the British Lace Operatives&apos;Federation.Trade Union Friction.A dispute which has been in existence for some months at West Bromwich between the Friendly Society of Ironfounders on the one hand and the Workers&apos; Union and the Gas, Municipal and General Workers&apos; Union on the other has now reached a climax. The latter union contends that until the 1st January the Ironfounders refused to accept as members unskilled men, who became members of the General Unions, but since then the Ironfounders state that all men employed in a foundry must either become members of their Union or leave the foundry. 50 ironfounders have now struck at Messrs. Highway and Andrews, Ltd., because a man belonging to the Gas, Municipal and General Workers&apos; Union was not dismissed. This Union has offered to provide the necessary labour for carrying on operations at the foundry.Overtime.The Nottingham Joint Board of the Engineering and Allied Trades has passed a resolution strongly disapproving of any overtime being worked until the unemployed are absorbed. The Hackney Branch of the National Amalgamated Society of Operative House and Ship Painters and Decorators have pledged themselves to refrain from working overtime under any circumstances whatsoever.Income Tax.Yeovil Branch of the A.S.E. has passed a resolution demanding the raising of the income tax exemption limit to  250, with  100 and  50 abatements for wives and children respectively. The employees of the Midland Railway Carriage and Waggon Co. have decided not to pay any more income tax until the exemption is raised to  250.Withdrawals from War Loan.The Newcastle Branch of the A.S.E. demands the instant withdrawal of the  80,000 invested by the Society in the Victory Loan ; the Walthamstow Branch of the Operative Heating and Domestic Engineers has passed a resolution calling upon its Executive to withdraw immediately any. money invested in the War Loan ; and the Bethnal Green Branch of the National Union of General Workers has protested against the investment by the Joint Council of  40,000 in the Funding Loan.Bousing.The action of the House of Lords in deleting from the English Housing Bill the clause making the preparation of town planning schemes obligatory on large urban local authori-ties after 1923 has called forth the denunciation of the Executive Committee of the Amalga-mated Society of Carpenters, Cabinet Makers and Joiners and also of various branches of other Trade Unions.
Gowt of Arbitration.During the week ended the 2nd August, 1919, the Court heard 16 cases in London. The most important concerned the Engineering and Foundry Trades, the Building Trade, the Carting Industry, and the Textile Trade (Lace).Federation of British Industries.This organisation, which represents, the principal industries of the country, appointed in March a committee which has just issued its report. The Committee is opposed to the nationalisation of industry, but suggests an alternative constructive policy. It advocates that by means of national and district industrial councils on the lines of the Whitley report, the workers in every industry should have a full voice in determining the conditions under which they are employed ; and suggests that in order that workers should obtain a better insight into the finance of industry, trade statistics should be more freely published. It supports the recommendations of the Government Committee on Trusts, and considers it desirable that a system of payment by results should be adopted with adequate safeguards for the worker, with a view to stimulating production.International Labour Conference.The organising committee for the International Labour Conference sat from the 31st July to the 4th August, in order to complete the documentary preparations for the Labour Conference to be held at Washington in October. 1Supreme Economic Council.  -The Supreme Economic Council sat in London last Friday and Saturday and dis-&apos;: cussed the present difficulty of securing adequate supplies of coal, food and raw materials for Europe.Socialist (Berne) International.The Conference of the Second (Berne) International met at Lucerne on the 2nd inst., under the presidency of Mr. Arthur Henderson, M. Branting being detained in Sweden. Upwards of 60 delegates were present, representing 22 countries.Mr. Henderson delivered a presidential address in which he referred to the ominous signs of a coming social upheaval, due to the disorganisation resulting from the five years of war, unemployment and famine. He voiced the demand of the International for the immediate summoning of the Council of the League of Nations and for the immediate inclusion in the League of Germany, Russia, Hungary and other States ; and called for the cessation of armed intervention in the internal affairs of Russia and denounced Koltchak. He declared for a steeply graduated capital levy and asserted that full use must be made of the machinery of the &quot; Labour Charter &quot; of the League of Nations to improve Inter-national Labour standards. At the afternoon session the report of the Acting Commission was the occasion of a lengthy discussion. Mr. Ramsay Macdonald stated that the task of the Second International was to find a way which would allow Russia to emerge from chaos and build up a Socialist society. M. Troelstra (Holland) inveighed against the ex-clusive application of the Parliamentary method of action. Herr Wels (German Majority Socialist) stressed his opinion that a decisive struggle against capitalism was being carried on to-day in Great Britain and America. M. Camille Huysmans defended the Commission and M. Yandervelde declared that the question of responsibilities must be settled before the International could be reconstituted and maintained that a union between the second and third Internationals was impossible. Mr. Arthur Henderson suggested that the Germans -should prepare s statement on responsibilities for submission to the next Congress. M. Nemecz (Czecho-Slovakia) in the course of the discussion declared that it was necessary to unite against American capitalism. The Conference appointed two Commissions to discuss international questions and to deal with the reconstruction of the International,, with instructions to report to a plenary meeting of the Conference on the 6th inst.Trade Union International Congress.The congress of the International Federation of Trade Unions opened at Amsterdam on the 26th July, and continued until the 2nd August. This is the first meeting of this international body since the war, and is notable because of the presence there for
the first time of delegates from the American Federation of Labour. The three most important topics discussed by the Congress were the question of responsibility for the war, the constitution of the International Federation and the attitude the Federation ought to adopt towards the International Labour Conference to be held under the auspices of the League of Nations in Washington in October. In the full congress on Tuesday, the 29th July, a special committee reported, which had been appointed to discuss the matter of the conduct of the German Trade Unionists during the war, and in this connection Herr jSassenhach issued a statement&quot; that the German Trade Unions had always recognised that Germany acted wrongly with regard to Belgium, but emphasising the fact that at the beginning of the war and during its course, the trade unionists were convinced that Germany was waging a defensive war. The statement continued that in this the German working classes were misled by the Government, and that they recognised that the workers of other countries might find it difficult to understand the conduct of the German trade unionists, during the war. This conduct, however, was forced upon them by the heavy struggle being waged by the German nation, and the statement concluded &quot; Now the truth is being brought home, and many things which we did under full conviction which it is clear ought, never to have been done.&quot; On the Tuesday the Congress decided to accept this statement provided that the German delegates subscribed to it in good faith so as to satisfy all the delegates. The statement, however, would appear to have been the cause of attacks in German newspapers on the German delegates, and in the later sessions of the Congress some uneasiness was shown as to the good faith of the German subscription to the statement..With regard to the constitution of the Internatonal Federation, it was decided that the contribution from the affiliated organisations should be at the rate of 12 Dutch florins, for each 12,000 members represented. (This is roughly equivalent to one  1 sterling at normal rates of exchange.) More controversy was aroused over the method of voting to be adopted. On the 26th July, it has been provisionally determined that one vote should be allowed for each million members or part thereof. The American and English delegates, however, were opposed to this arrangement being made permanent on the ground that it gave too great an importance to smaller affiliated organisations (especially the Scandinavian and Swiss national federations), and proposed that one vote should be allowed for every quarter of a million or fraction thereof of members. Eventually the following compromise was arrived at: One vote is to be allowed for each of the first two quarters of a million and an additional vote for each further half a million. This proposal was adopted by 18 votes to 5 with 6 abstentions.On the 1st August Mr. W. A. Appleton was elected President of the Congress by 31 votes to 18 (these 18 votes being apparently those of the German and Scandinavian delegates). M. Jouhaux was elected first Vice-President and M. Mertens second Vice-President. The German delegates thought that they ought at least to have had one of their number elected first Vice-President, and as this view was not acceptable to the Congress, refused to accept any office whatever in the International Bureau. On the Saturday a resolution was passed by an almost solid vote of continental delegates against the opposition of the British and American representatives, the sense of which was that the trade union centres affiliated to the International should refuse to participate in the Washington Conference unless trade union representatives of all countries were invited and unless delegates appointed by the trade union organisations affiliated to the Inter-national Federation were recognised as the legitimate labour representatives. If these demands were complied with the trade union representatives were to press on the. Washington Congress the adoption of the so-called Amsterdam programme.The presence of the American delegates would therefore seem not to have contributed to the amity of the proceedings, and while the dividing line at the beginning of the Conference was between the delegates of the Allied countries and those of Germany and Scandinavia, the dividing line at the end of the Congress was between the Continental delegates acting almost as a whole and the British and American delegates.Trade Boards.The following Orders have been made confirming rates fixed by Trade Boards.&apos; (1) Tobacco Trade Board (Great Britain). The general minimum time-rates for male workers range from 15s. 6d. per week for workers under 14^ years of age to 55s. per week (i.e., Is. IfdL per hour) for workers of 21 years of age and upwards, and for female workers from 12s. 6d. per week for workers under 14f years of age to 35s. per week (i.e., 8f(i per hour) for workers of 21 years of age and upwards. The Trade Board have also fixed overtime rates and for this purpose the normal number of hours of work per week has been declared to be 48.(C1861) S
(2) Sugar Confectionery and Food Preserving Trade Board (Ireland).--The overtime rates fixed are : (a) Time and a quarter for the first two hours overtime on any day except Sundays and Statutory Holidays ; (b) Time and a half after the first two hours overtime ; (c) Double time for all hours worked on Sundays and.

They propose also to fix overtime rates for these workers. The Board are considering the fixing of general minimum piece-rates, and the action to be taken in. respect of &quot; one-man &quot; boot and shoe repairing businesses,.and also in respect of underground workshops.The Paper Bag Trade Board (Great Britain) have issued a proposal to fix general minimum time-rates of Is. 1-fci an hour for male workers and Sd. an hour for female workers, with lower minimum rates for learners. They propose also to fix a piece-work basis time-rate of %\d. an hour for female workers, and to fix overtime rates for all classes of workers. The Board have referred to a, Committee the consideration of (i) The question of home-workers in the trade ; (ii) the application of the overtime rates to piece-workers ; (hi) the application of the piece-work basis time-rate to female learners.(2) District Reports.London and South-Eastern.Unemployment. A further small decrease in unemployment, is reported. An improvement has occurred in the position at Newhaven, owing to the partial resumption of the service of steamers to France.Resettlement. Transport difficulties continue, and the Maidstone Employment Committee complain of the large number of railway wagons employed in the carriage of old material from France. There is little change in the building situation. Messrs. Vickers, Ltd., are about to commence the manufacture of building tiles at Hythe.1 General. Unrest is still prevalent throughout the London area. In the matter of the Triple Alliance ballot, the forecast is to the effect that there will be a substantial majority for action.   (See also Part V.)South Midlands and Eastern.Unemployment. A decline in the live register of about 2,500 is reported for the week ending the 18th July. The improvement is mainly in the district of Leicester, where hosiery workers, who were unemployed as a consequence of the dyers&apos; and trimmers&apos; ;strike, are now returning to work.Resettlement. Few fresh developments of importance are reported. Shortage of railway wagons is retarding the delivery of material required by the Berkshire County Authorities.South-western.Unemployment. There is little change in the general position. An increase of unemployment is reported among men in the Bristol area, chiefly among those engaged in conveyance.
Clit oResettlement.-!!! the building industry a shortage of scaffold boards is reported at Basingstoke, and painters are scarce in the same area.. Complaints are received from Gosport that painters are working from 30 per cent to 40 per cent, slower than before the war, one contract having taken, 975 man-hours as compared with 470 man-hours previously.Lack of housing accommodation is reported to be hindering employment at Basing-stoke, where a firm of motor manufacturers could engage 500 men before Christmas if housing were available.General. Throughout the area the position continues quiet, and no further strikes have begun. The threatened disorganisation of the civil life of Southampton by the strike of the Corporation employees has not been brought about, and several minor disputes have been settled.At Plymouth the employment of women inspectors on the tramways has ceased, and no women are now employed on Work formerly done by men.West Midlands.Unemployment.-A. reduction in unemployment is reported, but at a considerably reduced rate.Resettlement.-The position as regards transport is still serious at Stourbridge. A firm in the fireclay industry requiring six trucks a day have received only four trucks in five days. The pottery industry in the area is also seriously affected. In Stoke-on-Trent difficulty is occurring in obtaining adequate supplies of material for tramway repairs.At Oldbury and Wednesbury, the Metropolitan Wagon, Carriage and Finance Co., Ltd., are carrying out large extensions to their works, which are expected to provide employment for three or four thousand additional workers.The Birmingham Housing Committee have decided not to recommend the use of hutments converted into dwellings, in view of the meagre accommodation provided, the excessive cost of conversion, and the short life of the hutments.General. Work has been resumed generally throughout the area in the mining, industry, and although there are a few unsettled strikes outstanding, the outlook is not serious.There is a certain amount of agitation among women workers in the light metal trades with the object of enforcing the payment of recently awarded advances without delay.Yorkshire and East Midlands. ,Unemployment. The live register of the Exchanges for the week ending the 25th July increased by over 7,500, owing to the coal strike.Resettlement. The Ilkeston, Long Eaton and Bradford Employment Committees are forming Emergency Sub-Committees to deal with the situation caused by the coal strike.A serious shortage of labour in the building trade is reported in the division. The scheme for the establishment of a clothing factory at Rotherham, has now been practically settled.General.-The dominating feature in the labour position is the miners&apos; strike, but apart from the strike and its effects, trade is, on the whole, good. There is, however, some unrest among ironfounders throughout the West Riding.A general resumption of work has occurred on the part of the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire miners.NorthWestem.Unemployment. A decrease of nearly 7,500 is reported, in the number of workers unemployed. There has been a satisfactory decrease in unemployment among women in the textile trades.Resettlement.-Schemes for sewage and street work at Stalybridge and for road work, at Mossley are held up by the difficulty of obtaining material. The authorities at Hyde have received sanction for a loan of  33,000 for highway maintenance, provided that the work is put in hand at once. At Ashton-under-Lyne the contractors are at work on an extension of the tramways depot,(C 1861) S 2
The shortage of moulders and pattern makers still continues to hamper the engineering industry. The Ashton-under-Lyne Employment Committee are pressing for the early release from the army&apos; of minders and piecers in the cotton industry, who, though not originally regarded as pivotal, are now considered to be urgently needed.General-Xhe general position in this area is rather worse than it has been recently. It is not, however, expected that the collieries in the Lancashire area will find their men brought out by the pressure of irresponsibles. There is some possibility of the moulders in Manchester ceasing work, on a claim for an advance in wages. If a strike occurs it might possibly be the beginning of unrest through the whole of the engineering trade.Northern.Unemployment. During the week ending the 18th July an increase in unemployment was registered for the first time since the beginning of May. Later figures, which will probably show the full effect of the Yorkshire coal strike, are not yet available. Unofficial information indicates that the number of unemployed considerably exceeds the total on the live register, especially in the Cleveland district, where a number of works have closed down. The increase reported is among men, the decline of unemployment among women continuing. - .Resettlement. Owing to shortage of coal the output of the Stockton works of the South Durham Iron and Steel Co. is stated to have fallen by 70,000 tons. The restriction limiting the import of timber to 75 per cent, of the pre-war import is said to be preventing employment at Newcastle, one firm alleging that this amount represents only 5 per cent, of their present requirements. At Birtley, shortage of labour is reported to be impeding the manufacture of bricks. Quarrymen, wagonwrights and agricultural labourers are also in request, and a serious shortage of labour in the building trades is reported throughout the division, except at Carlisle. Lack of housing accommodation is serious at Newburn, 500 employees at a large steel works being compelled to live in Newcastle. At Jarrow Messrs. Palmer&apos;s Shipbuilding &amp; Iron Co., Ltd., are only able to secure half their weekly requirement of 80 railway wagons.General. The Yorkshire coal dispute has not directly affected this area, the miners remaining loyal to the main federation. The attitude of the Yorkshire miners and the increased cost of all coal continue to arouse adverse criticism, and it is feared that when winter arrives the effects of the shortage may occasion a good deal of trouble with the working classes.Wales.Unemployment. Little change is reported in the general position. A substantial increase in unemployment, however, is expected on account of discharges from the works of the Mond Nickel Co., Ltd., at Clydbach, and the strike at the works of the Ebbw Vale Steel, Iron &amp; Coal Co., Ltd., where the furnaces have been blown out.Resettlement.-^omQ improvement has been secured in the supply of railway wagons to firms at Ruabon and Panteg.The Cardiff authorities are applying for the sanction of a loan of  121,000 to carry out extensions at the Rhubina water works, and another of  14,000 for the extension of the technical college. A waterworks is to be constructed by the Glaslyn Urban District Council in the Carnarvon area.General.-Industry appears to be in a quiet condition, and, apart from the stoppage in the steel trade, there has been no disturbance of normal routine.Extreme interest is being awakened regarding the ballot on direct action to be taken on the 20th and 21st August. A definite campaign has been initiated against extreme views, and in some cases revolutionary speakers have been silenced. It is difficult, however, at present to forecast the result of the ballot from the manifestations of opinions at demon-strations and counter-demonstrations.Scotland.Unemployment.-A decrease of over 2,000 during the week is reported. There are,, bowever, signs of increasing unemployment in the engineering trades, and a large Glasgow firm may be unable to reopen after the holidays owing to difficulties in the supplying.of coal and steel. The improvement in the textile trades continues, and a shortage of weavers is reported from Perth.
12 liPart V. Disputes. (a) Involving a Stoppage of Work.Police.The police strike began on Friday, 1st August. The Executive Committee of the Union appears to have reached its decision to strike on the 29th July, and the announcement of the decision was made to a mass meeting of police and prison officials at Central Hall, Westminster, on the 31st. The primary cause of the strike is the demand for &quot; full and frank recognition &quot; of the National Union of Police and Prison Officers ; and the manifesto issued by the Executive Committee expressly demands the removal of sections 1, 2 and 3 of the Police Bill, which provide for the constitution of the Police Federation and prohibit police officers from becoming or remaining members of any trade union, and adds to this a demand for the reinstatement of ex-police constable Spackman and others. - At first the number to respond to the summons was exceedingly few, even in London ; and the authorities promptly announced the dismissal of all strikers and the forfeiture of their pensions rights. By the 6th August, however, the number in London had increased to 1,136 out of 20,17,0, in Liverpool to 932 out of 2,100, in Birmingham to 119 out of 1,256, in Birkenhead to 112, and in Bootle to 63. In London conditions have remained normal. In Liverpool, however, serious looting took place during the Bank Holiday. The situation in this town was further complicated by a strike of tram-waymen in support of certain wage demands.The &quot; Daily Herald &quot; reports several resolutions expressing sympathy towards the police, passed by various bodies of workers, including one at the Annual Conference of the National Amalgamated Labourers&apos; Union.Mailwaymen.A sudden strike of railwaymen on the London and South-Western Bailway originated at Nine Elms on the 4th August, a resolution being passed declaring a general strike until the demands of the Police Union were conceded. In addition, the men have taken the opportunity to protest against the latest wages offer of the Eailway Executive Committee. The strike has been officially disowned by the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen and the National Union of Railwaymen. A certain number of men on the City and South London Tube Railway ceased work in conjunction with the South-Western Railwaymen. A meeting of railwaymen at Liverpool on the 4th instant also advocated action in support of the police strikers.^tijoal Miners.Yorkshire. A meeting of the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Council took place at Barnsley on the 7th August. Mr. Smith reported on the Conference with the South Yorkshire coal owners who had reaffirmed their offer of 14*3 increase on piece rates. No further action could be taken by the Miners&apos; Association until the interview with the Coal Controller on the 8th August had taken place.South Wales. Over 1,000 men at Grarngoch Collieries, near Swansea, struck on the 2nd August owing to the new seven-hour shift arrangement, by which they are expected to cease work at 2 p.m. on Saturdays instead of at 1 o&apos;clock.Northumberland.&apos; The miners at Ashington struck on the 2nd August for a six-hour shift on &quot; baff&quot; Saturdays.  Work was resumed after one day&apos;s strike.In Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, North Staffordshire and Leicestershire the coal owners have agreed to advance piece rates by 14*17 per cent.Lead Miners.Lead miners at Laxy, Isle of Man, have been on strike for over a month, the owners claiming a reduction of wages by 2s. 6d. a day, this addition having been in the nature of a war bonus.Resettlement. In Ayr and Paisley, complaints are made of delay in the delivery by -steel works of shipbuilding material. It is understood, however that this is due rather to the abnormally large demand for steel plates than to any serious shortage in the normal supply.InStornoAvay, where the employment position is very unfavourable, the Local Employ--ment Committee are investigating the&apos;feeling of crofters as to willow-growing.General. On the termination of the holiday period there has been a satisfactory resumption in the shipyards, and in engineering and allied trades.
Bakers.The strike of bakers took effect on the 2nd August. It is estimated that between 5,000 and 6,000 bakers are on strike in London and 20,000 throughout the country. The Ministry of Labour succeeded in arranging a conference between employers and operatives on the 1st August; this resulted in the employers agreeing to submit the question of a 44-hour week and a  4 minimum wage to arbitration. The operatives&apos; representatives, however, felt that they had no authority to postpone the strike. On the 4th August a ballot took place among the London bakers on the question of accepting arbitration; and by a 95 per cent, majority the offer was rejected. A national conference, however, held in the afternoon, expressed its willingness to meet the employers and the Co-operative Union on the 6th August. *Woodworkers.The lock-out in the furniture trades continues. The National Federation of Furniture Manufacturers has issued a manifesto stating its attitude and its reason for declaring a lock-out. The General Secretary of the National Amalgamated Furnishing Trades Association has replied to this manifesto in the &quot;Daily Herald &quot;.Municipal Employees.The strikes at Kensington and Paddington are still unsettled. Certain of the Grimsby Corporation workers struck on the 2nd August, demanding 5s. a week bonus and 12 days&apos; holiday. A 47-hour week has been granted by the Corporations at Wimbledon, Islington and Wandsworth.Agricultural Labourers.The strike of farm labourers in Shropshire (Gorton) has been settled. The employers are stated to have conceded the extra shilling an hour demanded for harvesting and to have promised the reinstatement of all the strikers.(b) Not Involving a Stoppage of Work.Goal Miners, &amp;c.Members of the Lothian Miners&apos; Association have been called upon to cease work on the 12th August owing to the non-settlement of the strike at Polton, where the miners have been out since the 29th May owing to the dismissal of two workmen.At a meeting on the 5th August of the South Wales Colliery Association it was decided to take a ballot on the qifestion of tendering notices to strike on the 1st September to enforce a settlement of the shotmen&apos;s wages question. Last December the employers promised to give this question their immediate attention, but no decision has yet been announced.Coal Porters.Dissatisfaction exists among London coalporters owing to the failure of the coalowners to grant a weekly minimum wage of  2 15s. and an increase of &amp;d. per ton on delivery. A ballot on the question of a strike to support these demands is to be jbaken on the 9th August.Metal Workers.The Friendly Society of Ironfounders and the Amalgamated Coremakers&apos; Union have tendered notices to cease work on the 23rd August unless employers concede a 15s. increase for time workers and proportionate increases for piece and lieu workers and apprentices.The engineers at Rochdale have protested against the recent decision of the Interim Court of Arbitration regarding their application for an advance of 15s. and call for a re-hearing of the claim.Pottery Trade.The employees of Messrs. Doulton &amp; Co., Lambeth, have tendered notices to strike on the 7th August All branches are demanding increased wages. The strike, however, has been postponed in order to enable negotiations to be carried on.Carpenters.The General Union of Carpenters and Joiners has decided to press for a 44-hour week, the national flat rate of wages and no overtime.R. S. HORNE.* On 6th August the Co-operative Societies offered to grant the whole of the national demands pending a settlement, and a resumption of work was recommended to take place at the Co-operative bakeries. On 7th August new proposals with regard to night work were submitted to the Operatives&apos; representatives; and a further conference on the question was arranged, to be confined to London employers and operatives.All inquiries relating to this report should be addressed to: Intelligence Division,Ministry of Labour,Montagu House,Whitehall,London, S.W.I.
