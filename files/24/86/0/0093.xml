-.......... -    ... .. \  q$ v&apos;; \ MBMORASOTI-; BY THS MISTER OP HSALTH. H.7.,    the cf M^itary hutp for civilian workers.  .(l)   In continuation of my memorandum of the 6th August which was considered at the Meeting of the Home Affairs Committee on that day I find that there is a strong feeling on the vjjgpt of some local authorities that they ought to he able to hire huts as they stand and use them for the provision of temporary accommodation.   It is urged in some instances that the site of the huts is only assured for a short period, that in any event the huts will not be required for very long and that, It is not worth while and may not even be possible to purchase the site,In some cases local authorities have been deterred from proceeding with the proposal for the use of hut encampments by the requirement of the Disposal Board that the local authority should take over the responsibilities of the War Office for reinstatement when the oa$p is given up.   It Is felt that this involves an indefinite obligation to which they are not prepared to commit themselves.(2)   If the use of huts involves considerable expenditure on conversion it is evident that en exceptionally strong case of need must be made out to warrant spending money on providing housing accommodation for a short period;   and where considerable expend! -ture is contemplated it will usually be best to purchase the huts and to arrange that the site is available for a period of about 10 years,I am advised however that it should be possible where huts can be used as they stand to make alterations at reasonable cost, whioh will render the hut3 available as an emergency measure or for a short, time until permanent houses have been built.I recommend therefore that where a local authority ,
*i r 1desires to use a hut encampment, i.e. without taking down and re-erecting the huts that the Disposal Board should be empowered to enter into an arrangement with the Ministry of Health for the hire of the camp, or a section of it if part only is required, and that the Ministry Of Health should make whatever arrangements might be necessary with the local, authority.&apos;    At the end of the period.of, letting, the camp should revest to the pi ape sal Boar$ to be sold in the usual way.I request Cabinet approval for this recommendation.c, addison.14th August, 1919.Ministry of Health,   , Wiitehall, S.w\l.
