9 q copy OP LETTER FROM MR. LLOYD GEORGE TO MR. BOKAR LAV/,November 2nd, 1918.My dear Bonar Law,The more I think of it the more convinced I become that there ought t.9 be a General Election, and that the sooner it can be arranged, subject to&apos;the exigencies of the military position, the better.   We have discussed this so often that I need not go at length into my reasons for this view.   My principal reason is that I believe it isessential that there should be a fresh Parliament, possessed of the authority which a General Election alone can give it., to deal with the difficult transitional period which will follow the cessation of hostilities.If there is to be an Election, I think it would be right that it should be a Coalition Election^ that is to say; that the country should be definitely invited to return candidates who undertake to support the present Gov-ernment not only to prosecute the War to its final end and negotiate the peace, but to deal with the problems of re-constructioh which must immediately arise directly an armistice is signed.   In other words, the test which in future must decide whether individual candidates will be sustained at the polls by your supporters and mine must be not, as in the past, a pledge to support the Government in the prosecution of the war but a definite pledge to support this Government.   I should myself desire to see this arrange-ment carried through on personal grounds;, for during the last two years I recognise that I have received the whole-hearted support of your Party, and x,hat the Government has had a unity both in aims and in action which has t^fguvery remarkable in a Coalition Government,   I am conviftced/^nat such an arrange-ment vdil be the best for the Country,   The problems with which we shall be faced immediately on the cessation of hos* tilities will be hardly less pressing and will require hardly less drastic action that those of the war itself.   They cannot, in my opinion, be dealt with without disaster on party lines.   It is vital that the national unity which has made possible victory in the war should be maintained tmi&amp;l at least the main foundations of national^and,international re-construction have been securely laid.   A Parliament returned to support a Government constituted as is the present Coal-it ion Government, would fulfil, I believe, this essential conditionf Jmd would also be possessed both of the necessary authority atid&quot;unity of purpose alike as to principles and methods, t&amp; enable it to deal effectively with the grave pro-problems which will confront it.Iran election on these lines is to take place I recognise that there must be a ststement of policy of such a nature as will retain to the greatest extent possible tho support of your followed! and of mine.   My fundamental ob-ject will be to promote the unity&quot;and development of the British Empire and of the nations of which it is composed, to preserve for them the position of influence and authority in the conduct of the world1s affairs which they have gained by their sacrifices and efforts in the cause of human liberty and progress, and to bring into being such condi-tions of living for the inhabitants of the 3ritish Isles as will secure plenty and opportunity to all.
I do not think it necessary to discuss in (to-tail how this programme is to too carried out.   I said something on tho sub-joot at Manchester ,in September last, especially in regard to tho imperative need of improving tho physical conditions of tho citizens of this country through hotter housing, better wages &apos;&apos; and bottor working conditions.     I lay emphasis on this because tho well-being of all people is tho foundation upon which alone can bo built the prosperity, tho security, and the greatness both of the United Kingdom and of tho Empire    But there are some matters about which you, as loader of tho Unionist party, will wish mo to say something more definite.In the first place&apos;in regard to economic policy.   I have already accepted tho /oliey of Imperial preference as defined in the Resolutions of the Imperial Conference, to the effect that 3 preference will be given on existing duties and on any duties which may subsequently bo imposed.     On this subject I think there is no difference of opinion between us.     I have at the same time stated that our policy does not include a tax on :&apos;ood, but that does not of course interfere with*tho granting of a proferanco on any article as, for example, tea or coffee, on which for Our own purposes wo have imposed a duty.   That ques-tion has, I think, been largely settled by the Com Production&quot; Bill, but, of course, one ox the groat objects which must be aimed at in the future is to maintain the improved agricultural position which has now boon reached;   and for this purpose a great deal can be and ought to toe done In many directions, including, for instance, an improvement and, indeed, a complete change of tho transport situation.    As regards other aapeots of this problem, I am prepared to say that the key industries on which the life of the nation depends must bo preserved.   I am prepared to say also that In order to keep up tho present standard of production and develop it to tho utmost extent possible, it is necessary that security should be given against the unfair competition to which our industries have been in the past subjected by the dumping of goods below tho actual cost of production.   Beyond this I should say that we must faoo all these questions with new eyes, without regard to pro-war views or to pro-war speeches.   The object which we have in view is to increase to the greatest possible extent production in this country so that no man or woman may want, and that all who do an honest day&apos;s work may have comfort for themselves and for their children. In order to secure better production and bottor distribution, I ; shall look at every problem simply from the point of view of what is the best method of securing tho objects at which we are aiming without any regard to theoretical opinions about ifreo Trade or Tariff Reform.The second question is Home Rule.   There will be no &quot;political peace either in the United ICing&amp;om or the Empire so long as tne present state of affairs continues.     The situation in regard to Ireland is governed by two fundamental facts;   tho first, tjn&amp;t the Home Rule Act of 1914 is upon the Statute book;   the second that, in accordance with the pledge which has been given by me in the past, and indeed by all Party leaders, I can support no settlement which would involve the forcible coercion of Ulster. Eighteen months ago the i/ovorrimont made alternative proposals for the settlement, of the Irish problem.   It offered either to bring Home Hule into immediate effect while excluding the six northern counties of Ulster from its operation, but setting up at the frame time a joint council which would bo empowered to extend tho   , ,p legislation of the Irish Parliament to Ulster, or to sot up t: convention of representative Irishmen to endeavour to find a; settlement for themselves.     The second alternative was adopted,
9 9 ofa vj put unfortunately after nearly a year1a earnest--deliberation the Convention found themselves unable to arrive at anything like agreement.   In these circumstances I claim the right to bring a settlement into effect based on the first of these alternatives,    I recognise, howover, that, in the present con-dition condition of Ireland such an attempt could not succeed and that it must be -postponed until the condition of Ireland makes it possible,   As to this last point, the Government will be chiefly guided by the advice it may receive from the Lord Lieutenant and the Irish Government.Finally there is the question of Welsh Disostablish-ment.   I am certain that nobody wishes to re-open religious controversy at this time.   The Welsh Church Act is on the Statute Book, and I do not think that there is any desire, even -on the part of the Welsh Church itself, that the Act should be repealed.   But I recognise that the long continr continuance of the war has created financial problems which must be taken into account.   I cannot make any definite proposals at the present moment, but I do not believe that once the question of principle no longer arises, it will be found impossible to arrive at a solution of these financial diffi-culties.It is necessary that the question of whether the next election is to be fought by the existing adiiclnistration as a coalition should be settled at once, otherwise tho difficulties in connection with candidates, both of your Party and of my supporters, will become intolerable.   I am prepared at once to agree that the Election should be con-tested on the basis of this letter, and after you have con-suited your colleagues I should be glad to know definitely whether we may consider an arrangement on those lines as concluded.Ever sincerely,(Sgd)   D. LLOYD GEORGE.
