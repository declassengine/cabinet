I &apos; g&quot; *INTERNATIONAL LABOUR , CONFTSRIS^OB, WASHINGTON, October 1919xMcmorn ndum by. Iffr.G.N. Barnes.Tho American Government hn,vc now announced thr.t the Conference will be opened on October 29th.     The preparations for tho Conference whioh havo boon undertaken by tho International Organizing Committee appointed by tho Peace Conference aro well-advanced.     Tho Committee have completed their report8 on tho different items included in the Agenda for tho Conference (see Annexe to Section 1 of Part XIII of tho Treaty)j and have drafted certain conventions or recommendations for the consideration of the Conference.     I append the text of those Conventions and recommendations, and as tho Cabinet will bo separating in the course of next week for some time, I desire to have instructions as to the oourso to he taken by tho Official British Delegates at Washington.1.   - The draft convention for a 48-hour week is on the general lines of tho Hours of Employment Bill which has been submitted to the Cabinet by the Minister of Labour,     In one important respect however the draft convention goes beyond the Bill in that it seeks to impose certain limitations on the power to vary the 48-hours limit in particular industries and on the power to work overtime*     It is of course of great importanoe, if uniformity of conditions is to be secured between tho different States in regard to this subject, that the limits within which modiflent ions of the principle of the 48-hour week may be granted by individual Governments should bo laid down as far as possible in tho Convention.    Tho mcro affirmation of tho principle of a 48-hour week, while leaving a wide discretion to each State to allow such exceptions as it considers desirable in tho circumstances of its country, would go far to nullify the benefits of the convention and would operate very disadvantageously to this country where the labour administration is strict.     I suggest that the Official British Derogates should be authorised to support the convention on the linos on which it is drawn.2.      Unemployment.   The Organizing Committee has apparently  ound itself unable in the present state of incarnation on the subject to put forward any far-reaching proposals.    The draft convention which they have framed deals with collection of statistics, tho co-ordination by each Government of the employment agencies (public and private) in its country, the establishment of Intor-State reciprocity in regard to unemployment benefits.    I understand the Ministry of Labour aro in favour of tho proposals.3.      Employment of Womon.    The proposals of the Committee under this head do not go in any important respect beyond the existing law in tho United Kingdom and no question therefore arises.4*      %ttlo,ygont of Children, (a) Minimum age of cnrplayrocnt The Organizing Committee have framed a ,draft&quot; convention for tho prohibition of employment of children under
tho ago of 14 years in industrial undertakings/  So far an England and Scotland and &quot;Tales arc concerned, practically adopted this limit already.     &apos;.7hon section 14 of the    -     g 0 K Education &apos;Act, 1918, is &quot;brought into force, employment in England and &quot;Talcs un to the ago of 14 ivi.ll he prohibited in factories, workshops, mines and querries, and in other occupations or.iployiri.ont uo to 12 will &quot;be prohibited, and such restrictions placed on employment between 12 and 14 as will practically have the effect of prohibiting employment in any regular industrial occupation..     In;&quot;Scotland, under section 17 of the Scottish Education Act; 1Q18, employment up to 15 will be-prohibited in factoriesj workshops, mines and quarries with an exception for children of the age of 1.3 and upwards who have.been exempted fjim attending school by the Education Authority.     In other occupations no definite age is fixed but certain restrictions arc imposed by section 16 of the Act of 19lfi.   In Ireland, no anondmonos of,the Education Law cbresponding to those effected by,the English and Scottish Education Acts of last year have so far boen mnde.     It is very desirable that the country should be rble at the Conference to declare itself unreservedly in favour of 14 as the limit for all industrial occupations,     It is certain that proposals to this effect will be made and will be strongly supported by labour and by public opinion,, especially - in this country and America, and the&apos;attitude of this country in regard to the question may have - important effects for the future success of the International Labour Organization.     It will be remembered the. t Article 427 of the Pence Treaty includes the abolition of child labour among the principles for regulating labour conditions which are regarded as of urgent and special importance.It will be seen from the summary above of the exist ing laws of the United Kingdom that the adoption of this limit in industrial occupations would&quot;not involve any serious changes. In England it would simply mean the extension of section 14 of the Education&quot;Act to the one&apos; or two industrial occupations not at present expressly covered, e,g. the railway and transport services.     The Board of Trade who&quot;have been consulted state that the Hallway Executive Committee see no reason why 14 should not be fixed as the minimum limit of age for employment of young persons in railway employment.     In Scotland, the adoption of the limit would mean a similar extension of section 17 of the    &apos; Scottish Act and the withdrawal of the power at present possessed by the Education Authority to grant exemptions for industrial employment to children over 13.   The Scottish Education Depart-ment have been consulted and raise no objection.-   In&apos;Ireland the changes would be more considerable.     The Irish Government have consulted the Department of Agriculture and Technical instruc-tion for Ireland, the Commissioners of national Education in Ireland, and the Local Government Bo card for Ireland, on the point.     The first two authorities recommended the prohibition ,of the employment of children for industrial purposes up to 13, but would allow children between 13 and 14 who have reached a certain educational standard, to enter such employment.1   The Local Government Board approves of fixing 14 as the age limit for all industrial occupations.I suggest therefore that the Official&apos; British Delegates should be authorised to support the convention drafted by the Organizing Committee,     The convention is carefully&quot;drawn&apos; so as to apply only to industrial&apos; occupations and hot to agriculture and commerce, and I may also point out&apos;?that it does not airily to domest ic employment.
In.proposing that the Official British Delegates should support the draft conventions framed by the Organizing Committee, I am thinking mainly of industrial countries which have reached more or less the same stage of industrial development as Great Britain. .   I. have not forgotten that the case of India and some other countries will require to be specially considered and modifications introduced.   This however is fully provided for,by Article 405 of the- Treaty.   I understand that the Organizing Committee have not yet received the report and proposals of the Indian Government in regard to the various items included in the Agenda for the Conference-.   It is very important that they should, be received as soon as possible.   I presume of course that India will be represented by its own Delegation which will fully present the Indian case,, but it is desirable of course that,the Official.British Delegates should, be able, at Washington to support the.representatives of the Indian Government and I suggest that it would:be useful if before the Official British Delegates proceed, to Washington they could have an opportunity 6f discussing the whole matter with the authorities at the India Office.(Initialled)   G. IT. B.2 Whitehall Gardens,, S.W, lfth August, 1919.(&quot;k) Niflht Employment of Young Persons.      On the question of the employment of children at night the Organizing Committee, propose the adoption, of the draft convention ,,prepared, ty the Berne Labour Conference, in 1913; but recommend that it should apply to all young persons up tJo the age of 18, instead of 16 as proposed at Berne.     The extension to lo is in accordance with the British&apos; Law and should, be strongly supported by the Official British Delegates.(0) Employment of Children in Unhealthy Processes.lo mast ion arises under this head.as the Organizing Committee have not seen their way to submit a.draft convention.

(a)   Employment of Women,Owing to the variety of the laws in force in different countries respecting the employment of women before and after ohildbirth, and in the present state of information, the Organising Committee thinks it only possible to propose as a basis for a draft international convention the following principlesi.   Prohibition of the employment of women in factories and workshops for a period of at least four weeks after childbirth.ii.   Adequate maternity benefits for such women to secure proper care and maintenance during tho period of her necessary absence from work before and after childbirth. The Committee suggest.    that this period should be calculated at not asss than six weeks.(b)   Employment of Women at Night.The Organising Committee recommend the adoption of the Berne Convention of 1906 by those States which have not yet adhered to it.(c) Employment of Women in unhealthy industries.The Organising Committee express the view that unhealthy processes can and ought to be made the subject of regulations based on the principle which the general experience of the different Industrial countries has shown or may show to be effective. Some of these have been indicated in general terms in paragraphs, above, e.g., prevention of dangerous dusts^and fumes entering the air of the workroom; provisions for personal cleanliness; substitution of harmless materials, etc.   The processes to be dealt with are extremely complicated.    The regulations in force in the different countries are elaborate and the Committee have, not had sufficient time or information to prepare a satisfactory scheme.    They accordingly recommend that the International Labour Office be instructed to continue their inquiries into the question as it affects all workers, male and female, and to prepare a report and recommendations for the next and subsequent Conferences.
