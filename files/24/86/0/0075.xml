,y or &quot;i 3/1 iiMil.(P 4676) From Viceroy, Foreign Department,0th August ld\(J.(Received 10th, 7.30 a.m.)Clear the line..1157      Secret.  .Afghanistan.   Following from Grant, 8th August&apos;: - *&quot; We had information yesterday that Afghan Council were again divided, and that there was little prospect of their signing Peace Treaty to-day. They Were upset apparently by our determination to demarcate whole line from Kabul River to Sassobi, and Ali Ahmad apparently feared consequence for himself if he returned to Kabul with treaty so disadvantageous to Afghanistan. They asked Nawab Maula Baksh, however, to go and see them. While Maula Baksh was with them I sent him a copy of Baluchistan telegram 382 L, of 6th. August, regarding rage of Abdul on receipt of Ali Ahmad&apos;s letter and possibility of Abdul breaking away from Amir, and told Nawab to inform Afghan delegates of gist of this telegram. Apparently this had immediate effect on.them, and shortly afterwards they said they would attend to-day and sign.&quot; They accordingly appeared here shortly after 10 to-day. The copies of treaty were then compared, and Ali Ahmad made a few more remarks regarding demarcation. I again assured him that demarcation would be on fair and equitable lines, and he accepted that.   He and 1 then signed, and I handed him a letter as follows: &quot; &apos; You asked me for some further assurance that Peace Treaty which the British Government now offer contains nothing that interferes with the complete liberty of Afghanistan either in internal or external matters. My friends, if you will read Treaty carefully you will see there is no such interference with the&apos;liberty of Afghanistan. You have told me Afghan Government are unwilling to renew arrangement(s) whereby late Amir agreed to follow unreservedly the advice of the British Government in regard to external relations. I have not, therefore, pressed this matter, and no mention is made in the Treaty. Therefore the. said Treaty and this letter leaves Afghanistan officially free and independent in its internal and external affairs. More-over, this war has cancelled all previous treaties.&apos;&quot;T had already, before receipt of Secretary of State&apos;s &quot;telegram of 5th August, shown Ali Ahmad draft letter practically on these lines, and could not therefore amend it as suggested. I had intentionally omitted last paragraph of my original draft, as I had made it clear several times both verbally and in writing that friendship and subsidy would depend largely on Avay in which Amir conducted his foreign relations and sought and accepted our advice. Ali Ahmad then asked if 1 would publish Treaty. 1 replied in the affirmative. He next asked if I would publish this letter. I said I would not, as, if I did, the Press might ask for all the letters that had passed between us, which possibly would.be inconvenient to him. I said, however, -that he could make what use of this letter he liked in Afghanistan. &apos;    .&quot;After signature, complimentary speeches were made by Sir Shams Shah, Sir Gurbaksh Singh, General Muhammad Yannusand Ghulam Muhammad.&quot;I then made brief&apos; address, ending with Viceroy&apos;s message. ,Copy will be forwarded separately. Ali Ahmad replied, calling, attention to .need of friendship between two Governments and expressing satisfaction, so far as he could, with conclusion of peace, It is clear, however, that he does not regard treaty as diplomatic triumph on his side.&quot;Ali Ahmad then spoke about repatriation of Afghan detenus and arrangements for Afghan Agency Services, about which i have telegraphed separately.&quot; I asked about British Agent at Kabul, and he said my letter has been delivered to him and that presumably he might stay at Kabul until relieved by his successor. I said that if Hafiz Saifullah wanted to return to India at once he must be allowed to do so and that we would arrange about his successor later.&quot; Ali Ahmad promised, to act accordingly. He then asked if he might leave an Afghan envoy in India. I said that there was no objection, lie said that envoy would probably either (corrupt group) or Abdur Rahman.&quot; We then discussed their journey, and arranged for them to leave on Monday night.   I then invited them to garden party here to-morrow, aiid meeting broke up.&quot; Addressed to Foreign, repeated to Private Secretary to Viceroy and Chief of General Staff.&quot;
We regard result of peace negotiations as highly satisfactory. With a few modifications, none of which is essential, our draft treaty has been accepted in full by Afghan delegates. For our success we are indebted to the admirable patience and tact and skill with which Grant, ably assisted by his associates, notably JVIafTey, has conducted throughout, despite obstacles and difficulties raised by Afghan delegates at every turn. - While we realise that we have embarked on nature of an experiment, we ourselves believe that it may well prove in the end more satisfactory and successful than the old arrangement. Much will depend on way Afghan Government is handled. They are very sensitive of the outward shadow of their liberties, but if due allowance is made for this, we feel confident that there is every chance that they will eventually seek our advice of their own accord in essential matters.  Text of Treaty is being published here.
