/w   /This document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government.RE-INSTATE MENT OF CIVIL SERVICE conscientious objectors.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.With reference to the Treasury Memorandum on this subject (G.T. 7737), I do not think a Conscientious Objector should be re-instated in the Civil Service in any case.   Wounded and disabled officers and soldiers have a prior claim.Parliament has recognized the claim of a bona fide Conscientious Objector to immunity from military duties, but that is a very different thing from giving him an appointment in the Civil Service.SECRET.1 ^Bstabt,WAR CABINET.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.August, 1919.(B19/363) 70 8/19 HiS 7396**
