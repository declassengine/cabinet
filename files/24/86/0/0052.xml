jlS DOCUCTT IS THE PROPERTY, OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY f.S GOVfeiMlSN^)g EO R?T, (,  G.T. 7940,CABINET-.SITUATION IN. THE CAUCASUS .. -Copy of a lotter^from Mr. Half our, tc the Prime Minister.British Del eg at ion, Paris,&apos; -9th August, 1919. &apos;My-dear prime Minister, -I am concerned, about the situation in the Caucasus. Evidence is. reaching us from every quarter that .the withdrawal of British&apos; -troops will be followed, by the most appalling massacre of the Armenians and general bloodshed -throughout the Caucasus.    I am entirely in favour of the policy of withdrawal.-   In fact I think it, is essential-from every point of.,view.,   But I oonfess that .I do. not like to look forward to the day when it will be said that while they had the fullest warning beforehand, the British precipitated a massacre of Armenians by deliberately, withdrawing their .t,ro;troops in the face&apos; of the advice of ail local authorities as -to the /probable consequences.   Coming on the top of the withdrawal from Archangel I do not think it will make a very pretty story. &apos; :&apos;There is only one way out and that is that America&apos; should take charge.    It is right that she should do this because she has always professed.interest in Armenia, and always given the&apos;Council the&apos; impression that she intended to; take a mandate for that country.    But.I am quite certain that shi. will not do anything so long as we are prepared to carry the burden ourselves.     On the other hand, I do not- think it is a good plan that she should be induced to go in through a massacre precipitated by,a British withdrawal, unless she has been given the opportunity to s&amp;ve the situa-t ion, herself&apos; and has refused, it.I should like, therefore, to be able to say to Mr. polk on behalf of the British Government that we are just as much.concerned as are the Americans about the possible consequences to Armenia and the Caucasus from a withdrawal of British troops, but that for various reasons it is quite impossible for the British troops to remain;   that our intention of leaving was made know to.the &quot;4H as far back as March and april   that if the Americans are prepared to undertake to find the necessary officers and men to protect the Armenians by the 3oth September the British Government will allow its troops to remain there until that date;   but that if America oannot relieve the situation by that time there is nothing for it but for the withdrawal to prooeed as from August 15th.Obviously, however, I cannot make this statement to polk-without your authority, because it involves the retention of British troops1in the Caucasus for a further six weeKS, and I appreciate fully the ottf actions to this course.  * I am most reluctant-!- to recommend it.    But I think the consequences of a general massacre precipitated by our with-irawal,must inevitably be more serious than any that can fiOiaow a.--further ;delay of six weeks in evacuation..    Moreover, J: - under stands. that if the British withdrawal begins, on
August 15th It will not be completed till October 8th.   If that is 90 the Americans ought to be able to aoye in gradually, thus only involving a comparatively short prolongation-tion of our stay.As usual it-is the Italians who have got us into this mess.    jiver since April they have said they were going to the Caucasus, and now they say they cannot.   - But, if as a result,, we can secure the Americans in their place, we shall have made a good exchange.    I am sending a. copy of this to curzon.-(Signed)   ARTHUR JAMBS BALFOUR-Right fion. D&apos; Lloyd George, 0    , II.3?. j 10 Downing streetj
