-from the Secretary o-p State for the Colonies to the Governor General of the Union of South Africa.(Sent, 9,&apos;-0 p,ra,, 7th August, 1919)With reference to your telegram of 6th August. The matter is of course one for decision of local government--ment but I think that the best course would be to obtain approval of Treaty by resolution of both Houses,   If as is probable, legislation on lines of British Bill is required in order to give effect to &quot;Treaty this would naturally follow as consequence of such resolution!.iILNEH.
