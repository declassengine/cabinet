Austrian Communists i&amp;ave taken the warning to heart, and in Russia Itself the Bolshevik oreed seems to be under-going profound modification.   As far as outside information is oonoemed, Russia seems to be now more isolated than at any time sinoe the Revolution.There is good reason for believing that the German Spartaoists had planned a rising for the first fortni^it in August, This was prevented by the wise precautions of the Government, whioh has managed with consummate skill to check the activities of the Reactionaries on the one hand and the Spartaoists on the other.In Italy-, lately the least stable of  luropean states, there is some reaction against Bolshevik activities.The Committee of Union and Progress is re-asserting itB baleful influenoe in &quot;Turkey and is promoting unrest throughout *$he Moslem world.The reports from Poland are disquieting; the Government is said to exercise little influenoe outside Warsaw, and Bolshevik agents are aotive throughout the country.In/
JN*   2   *-In Finland the eleotion of Erofessor Stahlberg in plaoe of General J^annerheim has stabilised the oountry.   The campaign against Russia was unpopular.   The Soviet Government has       . * disolaimed any intention, of attaoking Finland. *Sweden, and in a lesser degree Norway, are suffering from Bolshevik propaganda.In Bulgaria the Narrow Socialist Party had planned to proolalm a iiepublio of Soviets on July 26th and 27th, but the Government took strong abtion and arrested 10O persons, inoludlnj the Narrow Socialist leaders, with the result that no disturbances took plaoe,-The &quot;One Big Union&quot; movement has declined in Canada.   The Government has introduced drastic legislation against sedition,The race riots in the Northern States of iimerloa are reported to have been fomented by Bolshevik agitators.There is labour unrest in Japan and a Bolshevik, movement in Korea. .] [In China Bolshevism is making no headway.Labour &quot;disturbances Continue in Australia and the unrest has now extended to New Zealand. -
FRANCETIt is doubtful whether any French Statesman will have^-i&apos; the courage to tell his oountrymen of the desperate state of their financial position - still less to impose the neoessary . taxes.    When the truth is known at last there can scarcely fail to be ah explosion.The politioal situation at the moment is rather complex,&quot; -    4... owing to the close reiaiionshli) between poiitios andeconomics, which makes it difficult to discern when a movement is an expression of genuine in$ostrieiX itepst W is merely due to temporary or local causes^ jfc Ol^menfieau has succeeded, for. the time being, in defeating the radical socialists in the? Chamber, and the failure of the. attempt to bring about a General Strike on the. 21st of July, which wasto the efforts of the Conservative labour leaders, has also been a blow to the SjrtrejnlstSt  They oontinue, however, to oarry on an active propaganda throughout the. country and their efforts to influtno e th e younger generation are meeting with considerable suooess.   At lerons propaganda by means of theatrical entertainments Is being worked very effectively by the &quot;Nid Rouge&quot;, a party which does not at present appear f ,    to have any connection with the Paris Extremists.   The Government is not developing any constructive polloy to? reduce the high cost of living and Its financial methods are muoh criticised.    The appointment of V.   Benaudel as Editor of 1 ^Humanite&quot;&apos; and the reoonstltution of the? directorate of,, fchat newspaper so as to include representatives of-ali\ sections of the Sooialist Party is regarded as a victory for the Confederation Generale du Travail, but, on, the other hand, there is no doubt that the Confederation Generale du Travail suffered a loss of credit by the failure of the General Strike.  At a general meeting of th* Confederation G^nerale du Travail held on the 23rd of July, tTovhexn:, the.Secretary, did not oonoeal the fact that thestrike/
(Foreign)

strike was abandoned, in the fear that it would be a fias owing to its unpopularity.

The ratification or the Peace Treaty and the guarantee by Great Britain and the U.S.A to go to the assistance of France in the event of an attack by Germany have been well received, though doubt is expressed whether Great Britain will maintain an army sufficient for the purpose. At a meeting of the National Council of the Socialist Party oh the 14th of July, Longuet made a strong speech against the Treaty, but Albert Thomas, although orcriticising ? of its details, supported it. The reception given ? Foch and the French troops in London was much appreciated. 

The Miners returned to work on the 11th Of July. A special law has been passed whioh forbids officials, including Magistrates and policemen, the right to strike. There appears to be considerable unrest In the police force and efforts are being made induce the Government to recognise the Police Union. The police at Marseilles have already struck and the police in other towns are threatening to do so. In Alsace-Lorraine there is dissatisfaction, owing to the imposition of martial law and the restriction of political activities. The introduction of education is also reported to be causing ill-feeling among the working classes, whose children are Ignorant of the language. Longuet who was recently visited Alsace-Lorraine, is taking advantage of the situation. Reliable information which has been received proves that ths mutiny in the French Fleet at Odessa was part of a wide-spread anarchist movement directed from Paris, and that Longuet is in close touch with the Bolshevik agitation In France. The morale of the troops in France and Germany is said to be satisfactory.

BELGIUM.

The reception accorded to ths British troops in the

victory/
viotory march at Brussels is reporteel not to have been as enthusiastio as that aooorded to the French and Italian-, oontingents.   Though as a whole the Belgian Press may ba said to be hostile towards the: Allied Governments, the settlement of the German Bast African question is welcomed and is likely to remove some of the ill-feeling against-Great Britain..   It is generally believed that Great Britain-is enjoying a period of exoeptional prosperity and thatt the British working olasses are reluctant to? exert themselves, owing to the large profits whioh they have made during the war.   Colour is lent to this view of the situation by the tales whioh Belgian refugees have brought back of the wages whioh they earned in England.  Thera is less discontent among the working olasses in Belgium and a greater inclination ton work than in other oountries.   The industrial situation is steadily improving, more especially in the neighbourhood of Lieige, Verviers and Ghent.   The difficulty of obtaining raw material is reported to have oeased, and the greatest obstaole to oommeroial aotivity appears to be the. rate of exchange and the cost of transport.   It is thought that the closing of German banks in Belgium and the establishment of American and British banking oonoerns will prove an effective barrier to the domination of trade by German oommeroial and oredit institutions.The politioal situation in Belgium tends to beoome more stable.   The extremists of the Socialist Party appear to have lost a good deal of their influenoe.   While the Socialist Party still continues to struggle against the Catholios with undiminished energy, it is anticipated that it will be defeated at the ooming elections,SWITZERLANDThere is considerable Bolshevik propaganda in Switzerland and it appears from a reliable source that money for this purpose is being sent from Moscow via Buda Pesth,   At aitaoent/
reign)Ireoent meeting of the Swiss Bolsheviks, however, it was decided that the policy of strikes in Switzerland was to be abandoned as useless and the party decided to transfer ^ its activities to Poland.-The General Strike whioh began at Bale on July 3.0th still continues.   Two of the strike leaders have been arres and the Government have taken every precaution, inoluding the mobilization.of 6,000 troops, who are said to be thoroughly reliable.   At Zurioh, where a strike was deolarej , on.July 21st, the Workers1 Union decided to resume work on August 4th.   The Workers&apos; Union at Berne and a full meeting of the Swiss Workers 1 Union at Olten have both pronounoed against the strikes;   it is therefore likely that the movement will collapse in a few days.(Jrimm was.interned on the 7th of July but, apart from a[ popular demonstration near the railway station, where Grimm addressed his friends at Berne, no disturbances of any importance occurred.   It seems oertain that Platten, the , Communist Leader, orashed while travelling by aeroplane fron) Moscow.to, Buda Pesth, as he has not been heard of since he started.The Conferenoe of the 2nd International began at Luoern on 1st August,    The opening sessions were mainly taken up ... with discussions concerning Germany&apos;8 responsibility for the outbreak of war. ........A long debate on Bolshevism was held on August 4th, The speeches were somewhat inconclusive, however, and it was finally deoioed to appoint a Committee to study the matter in all its bearings and to report to the Geneva Congress in February.IIn spite of its difficult position the Government appeals: to have gained in strength.   It has succeeded in maintainingorder/
oreign) l- 5order and-frustrating the Royalist and Spartaoist plots. Its future will depend upon its ability to produce an %)        acceptable scheme of reconstruction.   At present it seemsto have the support of the majority of the population, whioh is weary of war and civil commotion, and is anxious to return to peaceful and profitable industry.   The Young Communist Party in Germany is increasing enormously, but its activities are much hampered by the Government,   Its official press is so severely censored that it is obliged to oarry on its propaganda by underhand means.   It is reported that a widespread Communist organization.exists for the formation of a Red Army to destroy;, the power of Ncske &apos;s. volunteer corps.   Energetic SpartaoiBt propaganda is being - carried on in Sohleswig and it is stated that it is supported by the Danish Syndicalists.The Government seems to have abandoned their earlier hope of fomenting Bolshevism in the Allied oountries, and to be genuinely alarmed at the spread &quot;of Communism in Germany. It has even made overtures to our Servioe in the occupied territory to make common cause against the Spartaoists, whom it represents as planning to send agents into France with the labourers for the devastated areas.There is good reason for believing that the Spartaoists had planned a rising for the first fortnight in August, but that the preparations of the Government deterred them.In the area occupied by the British Army the   Socialist Party appears to be gaining ground:   the revolutionary ideas of returning soldiers are even affecting the peasantry, and the Churoh is said to be losing its influenoe over the people.    In Berlin there have recently been Monarchist demonstrations, and a further reactionary tendenoy to be H        noted was the refusal of the National Assembly to exclude members of the former ruling Houses from election to the Imperial Presidency.    Ihe twenty-four hours&apos; strike on the21st/
(Foreign) -6 -21st of July, designed to prove the solidarity of labour, \ a failure in Germany.    &quot;Hie railway strike was defeated by Noske,    The industrial situation appears to be improving^ The activity of the Frenoh, Belgian and American Commercial travellers, as contrasted with that of the British, is marked.    There is still a shortage of food and the high prioes oontinue.    It is reported that Germany will shortly resume diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia and, as a result of the recent Industrial Mission from Berlin to Moscow, it is stated that two big German Syndicates are to supply Central Russia with railway material.    It appears tli Dr. so if has been offered the ohoioe of the Embassy either at Washington or London.    Solf is at present in Switzerland and is said to be in direct communication with the United States over finahoial and oommeroial matters.In Switzerland the general opinion is that Germany will soon settle down and honestly attempt to oarry out the peace conditions.    The only irritants are said to be the Polish question and the Smperor^ trial.    It is even reported that both the j^french and the...Belgians are opposed to the trial and are trying to induce, the  Dutoh to refuse I his extradition.    Germans who may be required to surrendeil to the allies for trial in oonneotion with war orimeB are reported to be eeoaping from Germany, and some of them ore said to be trying&apos; to make their way to Japan with the oonnivanoe of the Japanese.A protest against the terms of the Peace Treaty has reoently been forwarded to a member of the British Cabinet from Bavaria.    The protest, whioh was printed on a post oard, was in the form of &quot;A Statement for I9I9 of the Robbery-State-Assooiation (i3ntente) of Whioh John Bull&apos;s Capitalism was General Manager, Wilson, Preacher of HumaStLt and Clemen^eau, Propagator of Hate,&quot;The/

The efforts of the Government to reduce the prioes 0$ commodities and to check profiteering have met with a certain measure of suooess.   The failure of the General Strike on the 21st of July has also undoubtedly strengthened Signor Nitti&apos;s position, and at present he appears to have the support of the Conservative and financial sections of the population.   He has not sucoeeded, however, in pacifying th8 extremists, or in ooming to an understanding with the Nationalists.   The Soldiers&apos; Party, which to-day is an important factor in Italian political life and whioh, if properly led, oould do much to re-organize the affairs of the oountry, is openly hostile to the Government,   k significant feature of recent events in Italy has been the prominent part whioh has been played in them by the M;.rditiM (Storm Troops) and the &quot;jftitiiati&quot; (Wounded). Wherever socialist or pacifist riots have broken out there have invariably been patriotlo counter-demonstrations organized by the disoharged and wounded soldiers.   This phenomenon, although more noticeablejduring the last few months, has been conspicuous, especially in the north of Italy, since October 1917,   Signer Resnati, a Republican Freemason, who appears to possess great powers of organization is the moving spirit behind these demonstrations, and he is supported by Signer Pirolini in the Chamber and Signer Mussolini, a brilliant journalist , in the Press.   The motive power of these Military iissooiations is republican and revolutionary, but it i3 opposed to the extreme.Socialists .7. and Bolshevists.   In the present state of affairs in italy the/
the open hostility between&apos;these two political seotions may lead to a political conflagration, the results of whioh it is difficult to foresee. 4The Italians appear to be assisting the agitation by the Young Turks against England and Oreeoe.The fall of Bela Kun*s government was due partly to the serious reverses suffered by the Bed Army and partly to the hostility of the country people to a Labour Dictatorship. Belo Kun seems to have placed;great reliance on popular risings taking plaoe in France and Italy in oonneotion with the International Strike movement organized for the 21st July..He was also anxious for the Russians to attack the Roumanians in the rear.   There appears, however, to have been a laok of co-operation between the Soviet Governments in. Russia and Hungary, due probably to laok of organization in the Intelligence&apos;Service.   Reliable information confirms the report that Bela Kun*s. government was supplied with munitions of vaar from Italy.&quot;&apos; AUSTRIASven before the disappearance of,the Communist Government in Hungary, the Communist Party in Austria seems to have decided that the moment had not arrived for deolaring a Soviet Government in Vienna,   The Party is said to be short of funds and to be disinclined to risk a failure suoh&apos; as attended the attempt to form a Soviet Government in Munich, The institution of peas^its Councils in Austria is gaining ground and is likely to be a bulwark against Bolshevism. Bolshevik agents are busily at work and six Hungarians were recently arrested at Wiener Keustadt.   They were in possession of jewellery to the value of half a million        ^ kronen and had been ordered by Bela Kun to sell it in Austria in order to raise money, which was badly needed in Hungary.$very/
*j (j d (Foreign)Every effort has been made by the Bolsheviks and also by 0 supporters of the anoien regime to exoite the people againstthe peaoe Terms, but without much success, and the probability is that the German Austrians will wait patiently for a union with Germany,ROOMAKIA.      ..-   . . . .A oonspiraoy to establish a Soviet Republic in Bessarabia was reoantly disoovered by the Roumanian Polioe. The existence of an organization to send Information to Odessa, whence it was to be forwarded to KieiY and Moscow, was also disoovered.Roumanian agents are particularly active, endeavouring to win over the Jewish population in Bessarabia.BULGARIAThe Coiomuniats have been particularly aotive recently, especially in the country districts, but it is said that they have met with little sucoess,   The people&apos;s whole attention is fixed upon the harvest.   The antagonism between the Communists and the Broad Sooialists is very bitter.The General Election has been fixed for the. 17th of August, but will probably be postponed.The strike of railwaymen planned for the 21st of July did not materialize;   the Broad Socialists used all theirHinfluence to ?top it. M1MONTEMEGRO during the last few months several Montenegrin Socialist! organizations have ipined the Serbian Socialist party.A general strike broke out in Athens on the 21st of July, the demands including a fifty per cent reduction inprioes/
- 10 -prices, an eight&quot;hours&apos; day, the abolition of the press - censorship and the release of four leaders of the Workers&apos;Union who had been arrested on the 18th of July and deported . to Crete.  ;The Government appears to have,taken vigorousPaction to repress the strike, but it is probable that furtherstrikes will take place,The Socialist Party has gained in strength during thelast few years and has now a powerful following in the oountrjgmyrnaGuerilla warfare between the Greeks and Turks continues, There is evidence to show that &quot;the Italians are supporting the Turks.According,to a Hungarian report, politioal outbreaks have occurred in Croatia, and Serbian troops have been called in to suppress the revolutionaries.   The Socialist Party in Serbia has deol&amp;red its adherence to the Third International and refused to aooept representation iri the Parliament at Belgrade.   The extremists in Bosnia, D&amp;Matia and Croatia are said to have adopted the sarnie programme.Tlie Albanians, in the United States are returning to the! pro-Austrian policy, alleging that the Italians are crushing ,Albania- H?hey are opposed to the League of Nations and are said to be endeavouring to stir up trouble between the Greeks and the Italians,   Farm S. Noli, an Albanian, of Boston, is reported to have oolleoted 120,000 dollars in bonds for the establishment of a National Government in Albania.mmThere has been a considerable gathering of the YoungTurk Party at Soheveningen in Holland;   Italy is said^o beintriguing with these Turkish emissaries and Germany is stilfurnishing;
furnishing them with funds.   It is reported that the Turkish u Constitutional Party, of whioh the Sultan is the&quot; chief supporter, is most anxious to keep on good terms with Great Britain,   This Party might even be willing for us to establish, ourselves at Constantinople in the same manner as we are established at Cuiro, if the nominal unity of the Turkish Empire could be retained.   The party is ready to recognise&quot; the autonomy of Armenia, but is not prepared to have any dealings with jflranoe or Italy, and is opposed to the occupation of Smyrna by the Greeks,   It is reported that efforts are being made to induce the Sultan to assist in the formation of. a Pen-Islamio League, and there are signs that the Turks are endeavouring to retain the sympathy of the Moslem subjects of Great Britain,   They have been enoouraged in this policy&apos; by recent events in India, Afghanistan and Sgypt.   Bolshevik agents are working in co-operation with the Young Turks, both in Turkey and Transoaiioasia,02SCH0-3L0VA1CUThe Czecho-3lovak troops, who have been serving under Koltchak, are reported by the Bolsheviks to be anxious to return to their own country, and the small but aotive body of Communists in Czecho-Slovakia are anxious to know whether .. they count on these troops to support a revolution.   Professor Masaryk, the President of the Republio, is reported to be opposed to any form of allianoe, economic or otherwise, with Austria.russia the political situation in Soviet Russia is now somewhat obscure.   There are probably two different currents of thought at work.   Lenin is said to recognise the fact that, while Bolshevism has been successful in destroying the anoient system of government, it has failed to establish anything in its plnoe.   He is reported, therefore, to be attempting to arrive at an understanding with the more moderate parties andnis/
i(Foreign) *    )- 12 *&quot;his policy of nationalising industries is becoming a less pronounced tenet of his areed.Trotsky and Tchitoherin, on the other hand, are said to be in favour of the continuance of the world war against   &apos; society as it is at present constituted,   At present the Military Wing of the extremists under Trotsky appears to control the situation and.the failure of the anti-Bolshevik foroes has undoubtedly strengthened their hand.At the some time, the conditions in Russia are suoh that the continuance in power of the existing Government is by no means certain.   A Bolshevik message, dated the 12th of July, stated that, owing to the fall of Tsaritsin, whioh deprived the principal centres of their supplies of fuel and grain, the Soviet Republic was in danger.   The scarcity of food and fuel in Petrograd, and to a leaser extent in Moscow, is acute, and there is no doubt that, even if the harvest&apos;is a good one / the situation will become even worse unless something is clone to improve the transport facilities.   Keans of communication in Russia are decreasing^ day by day and even the river tonnage has decreased considerably.   The Soviet Government is becoming more and more out off  rom the outside world and it is interesting to note that as late as the 25th of July it was ignorant of the failure of the.International Strike proposed for the 21s of July, and was still under the impression that Bela Kun was in power some days after his fall.Although the anti-Jewish feeling remains the same, the reports of pogroms in the Ukraine must be acoepted with reserve.   Rumours of pogroms are being oiroulated by the Bolsheviks , UkrainS^ns and Roumanians for political purposes the evangelising enthusiasm of the Bolsheviks is as great as ever and they are still oonvinoed that they can raise a world revolution.   In the East especially they are Qconfident/
confident of success.   They appear to be endeavouring to form a. Central Pan-Islamio State in Asia, whioh is to include Khiva, Bokhara and Turkestan, and are working with the Young Turk Party to foment Moslem,opinion against the British.   Their method of propaganda is to issue statements that Constantinople has been bombed and looted, the women enslaved and the Sultan dethroned, and that the British are adopting similar methods in Mecca.   In spite of the statements in the Soviet Press, however, that the soil in Asia is quite prepared for the&apos; dissemination of Bolshevism, the peasants in Turkestan and the people in Afghanistan are said to be violently anti-Bolshevik.   A Bolshevik report states that one of the reasons for the recent Afghan war was that the Amir was; anxious to be reoognised as Caliph and that he declared war in the hope that the Mussulmans of Asia and Africa would. join him. &apos;&apos;        :?%m t.Conditions in Poland are said to be chaotic   It is reported that the Government has no influence outside the capital, and there is open discontent at its failure to cope with the eoonomio situation.    Lithuania is in a&quot; state of .  latent anarchy -and Bolshevik agitators are busily at work, Definite evidence is available to prove that the Bolshevik movement in Poland is being direoted from Moscow,&apos;   Radek should not be allowed to remain in the oouritry after his expulsion from Germany.   .FIKLAMD*Phe election of Professor Stahlberg as President in the plaoe of General Mannerheim has materially oh&amp;nged the political&apos;:and military situation in Finland.   Stahlberg is said to be thoroughly representative of Finnish thought and culture, and his election has had a soothing effeotupon/
1upon the internal situation in Finland.,  The Military operations against the Bolsheviks were not popular, and the defeat at     9 Videle had seriously affected the morale of the.Finnish troops. It is doubtful therefore, even if Itoinerheim had been re-elected whether Finland would-have been a contributing f aot or of muoh importance in Russian affairs.The .Bol3heviks now state that they have.no. intention of attacking Finland.   German influence in Finland iS; still strong and it was certainly exerted against Mannerheim.at the election, All reports from Finland point to Finnish dissatisfaction, with the Entente,&quot; NORWAY..... . &apos;Labour conditions in Norway are in an extremely unsettled state, in spite of the fact that the Government and the employers are showing a disposition to grant all the demands of the working classes.   The Government is taking extensive measuxel to deal with the housing problem, With the, result that the labouring man pays hardly more rent to-day than he did before the war.   The 21st of July - the day fixed for a general cessation of industry - passed off on the whole very quietly, and, generally speaking. the strike was a f iasoo.   The Bolshevi: propaganda oontinues, but it is&quot;thought that Bolshevism will not meet with muoh suooess unless tfce country receives a lead from larger iluropean oountries.   There is. a considerable feeling of sympathy with -Germany, which is due pertly to a natural pity for the beaten, and partly to a feeling that the oonditions of peaoe are too onerous.SWEDEN &quot;: &apos;  &apos;-&quot;   &apos;    &apos;. .,     -    ,       .The Bolsheviks are busily at work, striving to gain oontrolof Swedish labour through their entrance.into and corruption^ of the Labour Unions. -Their efforts have been attended with a oertain measureof/
(Foreign) .....     f0pof suooess.   The Seamen^ strike and the Printers1 strike were both oaused by the Bolshevik elements in the Unions. The moderate Socialists, it is thought, will no longer be able to oo-operate with the extremists.   The Swedish Government has deoided to utilize the servloes of reliable men in the Landsturm to combat any attempt of the Bolsheviks to employ armed force.   Only men of over forty years of age have so far been approaohed by the Government.   They have . been asked in strict confidence to obtain the co-operation of younger men in the force.   It is hoped by this means to obtain a reliable body of men in case trouble arises.There appears to be a reorudesoenoe of pro-German and anti-English propaganda in 3weden,   The press generally holds the view that unless the terms of Peace are revised there wil^ be endless complications which will lead to future wars.   The5 extreme socialists have expressed their intention of doing all in their power to prevent Sweden from joining the League of Nations.Bolshevik propaganda seems to be oarrled out in Denmark by means of a Jewish organization known as the &quot;Kommunistiok Organ&quot;.    Funds are supplied through the Rasta Bureau in Stockholm.HOLLAND ;At a private meeting of the Communist Party in Holland, iVfynkoop stated that he had sent an emissary to Tohitoherin,but Bolshevism does not appear to, be gaining ground in thecountry.  Holland, however, is a centre for.spreading Bolshevik propaganda in the Allied countries, , Wynkpop is reported tohave expressed his disappointment at the look of euooess ofthis propaganda in England.   The Internationalist anti-Hi litarist Association, which has its headquarters atAmsterdam, has recently inoreased its membership and isr - . assuming/
assuming the oharaoter of a revolutionary organization, There have been several strikes in Holland reoently,but the general strike on the 21st of July was a failure. There was an open air demonstration at Amsterdam, whi^was attended by about a thousand strikers and was addressed by Wynkoop, but there was no disorder,   Wynkoop*s paper&quot;De Tribune&quot; is badly in need of funds.The opening of the International Trade Union Conferenceat t^sterdam on the 28th July was marked by a strong attackon the German delegates concerning Germany^ conduct duringthe war.- The final session terminated on august 2nd with the adoption of four&apos;resolutions.The first condemned the blockade by the Allied governing against Russia and Hungary;   the second urged on investigati into the Trade Union movement in Husala;   the third declared that eoonomio disorganization, aooentuated by the war, hod been caused by the impotence of capitalism to reorganize production in such a way as to ensure the well-being of the masses, and the fourth declared that the League of Nations should be founded on the will and co-operation of the peoples Nations may no longer judge their own oases by force.An interesting report has been reoeived of the manner in whioh Baroelona, and the greater part of Spain, was saved from revolution last April,   general Dei Bosch, the new Civil Governor, decided&apos;&apos;to revive a mediifi val institution known as Sometah (Catalan &quot;I am ready&quot;),   % voluntary Civil !,;1&amp;uSm* V:oojfopo&apos;8&amp;x&apos;v6&apos;f all the better elements in the oity, padded two: and two with their own&apos; arms&apos; and kept order. &apos; -iftor twelve days the workmen in the essential servioes * were invited to resume work, whioh had been carried on by soldiers,    They came forward in large numbers and the strike. was/
was bz-oken,Mae Authorities were satisfied, however, that behind it all was some sinister international influence.

While the large influx of negroes.into the &apos;-; Northern states during the shortage of labour during the war made a collision almost inevitable, it is interesting to note that the outbreak of negro, riots in Chicago,,took place shortly after the return of Trotter from.

Ele,Valera is being questioned as to the oonneotion between the Sinn Feiners and the Bolsheviks, and is trying to minimise the oonneotion, in view of the strong public feeling ,     against Bolshevism.   There is evidence that the Germans are contributing more to Sinn Fein funds than the Irish themselves. In Columbia the inhabitants are extremely pro-German and it is stated ?that the majority of merchants would sooner sell their goods to Germany at a loss than to England at a profit.
