secret, ^QjMML &apos;/f ! a r   c ABini,CIRCULATION OF IiiffOIftiATIOU. Memo r gnduij. fcy.. the .Socre tary.I.   secret amd CONFIDENTIAL II^OHMATIOIJ.1.   The time has arrived when, in the interests of economy, it is desirable to come to a. decision about the future of the &quot;Western&quot;, &quot;Eastern&quot;, and &quot;British Empire&quot; reports, which are compiled in the Offices of the War Cabinet in order to place at the disposal of Ministers and others, at home and in the Dominions, political and economic confidential information reaching the Cabinet from various departments. Several members of the y/ar Cabinet itself, who also receive all the secret information in a bulky and undigested form, reported recently that they found these weekly precis of yalue to them, and, as affecting the dominions, I received the following note from General Smuts before he left this country:-&quot;You circulated a Memorandum some months ago when., shortly after the Armistice you were anxious to cut down your establishments, and you enquired what our views were in regard to the circulation of information. I said at the time that I thought one of the dangers of the past had been the ignorance of the Dominions in&apos; regard to the various inter-national questions which were daily cropping ,up, and were being solved in one way or another throughout the chancelleries of Europe, without our knowing anything about them., As,a result of what I said I think that you kept on the staff preparing the &quot;General and Western Report&quot;, and rather thought at the time that the note which I had struck was one v/hich would appeal to the Government, and that they v?oul&amp; take steps,to keep us.informed.     Since then, of course,, the Dominions have been strongly represented over here, and the need for the dissemination of information has not been acute.   How, hov/ever, I think I am the last Overseas Minister here, and I am embarking to-morrow. I hope, therefore, that the question of inter-Imperial information, in the shape of reports^, to the Dominion Governments, will receive early consideration rand also your cordial support.&quot;2.   Under the present aystorn weekly reports (tho &quot;Western and General&quot; and &quot;Eastern&quot;) deal with Foreign countries., and with-general matters of interest, in the political and economic sphere;   another weekly report (the &quot;British Empire and Africa&quot;) deals with similar subjects in the Empire and in foreign Colonies in Africa.     Tho present staff and. their cost are shown in an Appendix.&apos; Since the Armistice an economy has/  &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;   ;
been effected by the reduction of one Lady Clerk.    During the War over 1,000 papers, ranging from reports of 100 or 2110re pages to telegrams of 10 words, were dealt with weekly in the Western Report alone.    The number of papers to be dealt with has now fallen considerably and considerable reductions in expense could be effected by substituting fortnightly for weekly-reports;   the &quot;Western and General&quot; and, &quot;Eastern&quot; reports&apos; could then be combined in one report, that Report and the &quot;British Empire&quot;being issued in alter-nate weeks.3.    The work has been carried on since its establish-ment by the following officers&quot;Western and general% and &quot;British Empire&quot; Reports .Editors:- Lt,Col. L.S.Amery,, M.P., succeeded by MajorGeneral Sir George Aston, K.C.B., in December, 1917,   Assistants:- Lt.Oomdr,H.Pirie-Gordon, D.S.C,, R.N.V.R., LieUt.F.Storr8, R.N.V.R,(,/ho died at his post),; Lieut,-CommanderM.Green, R.1I.V.R., (temporarily), Oaptain V.Bulkeley Johnson of the Rifle Brigade - a . severely wounded officer - and Mr.Howard . d^gville, of the Empire ParliamentaryAssociation, v/ho has latterly had sole chargeof the &quot;British Empire&quot; report,&quot;Eastern&quot; Report.Editors:-    The late Lt.Colonel Sir Mark Sykea, and &apos;Kr.Egerton Beck.I am greatly indebted to all the above officers for their unremitting services.4,     If the scheme proposed in paragraph 3 is adopted, I do not think it would be justifiable in present circum-stanoes to employ a larger staff than one editor at  500 a , year, and one clerk, -   It must be clearTynihderetood, however that both reports will be.greatly curtailed by the employment of so small a staff.5.    The points affecting the compilation and distribu-tion oi secret and confidential information from this office, on which a decision is asked are :-(1) Does the Tar Cabinet desire the continuance of these Reports?(S) If it does, whether fortnightly reports are to be issued, and a reduced staff maintained for the purpose as proposed in paragraphs 3 and 4?6.    I think it ray duty to call the attention of the War Cabinet to a fact reported by the staff in charge of thes Reports,, namely that in sifting confidential information coming in from different departments, it has been noticed that much valuable information about political and economic affairs in foreign court ries has been received during the War not only from the Foreign Office, but also from the War
Office, Mmiralty, Hotae Office, and from the several departments dealing with foreign commercial mtters. There has been a certain amount of unavoidable overlapping between different departments in the compilation and issue Of information about such matters under war conditions. Some further co-ordination would see^desirable in the interests of economy.II, yOlMTOTIETOlAl. IETOBMATION- 7,    Before leaving England, General Smuts forwarded to me a copy of a letter he had addressed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies on the question of maintaining a full service of inter-Imperial information.    -This has been circulated in Paper G.T,7?58,    The following is an extract&quot;May I say a word on the great importance of maintaining a full service of inter-Imperial information?    I believe this.work is now being done by Reuter&apos;s and that it costs less than  80,000 per annum.    nothing could be more important in keeping the scattered members of the Empire together than a full and efficient information service, and the  20,000 is probably doing more good than millions of pounds spent in other directions.&quot;8,     It seems desirable to consider this representa-tion in conjunction with the above proposals for the compi lation and circulation of information derived from secret and confidential services.(Sgd.) -M.P.A.HANOTSecretary to the War Cabinet.2t Whitehall Gardens, S.W., 14th August, 1919.
