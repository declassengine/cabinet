(this Docimlnt; la tho property of His Britannia Majesty&apos;b government)mm. \%.WAR OABIHSI, &apos; G jTe-7924.                                    -----$HE FUTURE OF TEE OOAT-MJCTG INDUSTRY.^ .-.    j r/^Summary of the Frige -Minister&apos; o Proposals.1.     The Government accept the policy of State purchase of minerals on which all the Reports of the Coal Commission (Second Stage) are unanimous.   As part of the scheme for the * purchase of the minerals, a levy will &quot;be made upon the compensa-tion to be paid in England and Wales which will at least equal tho reduotion from compensation&apos;which would otherwise have-been paid in Scotland had the system of rate levy ,on receipts for mineral values not ezistod in that country.   This deduction and the capitalised value of the rates levied in Scotland will form a fund to be expended in amelioration of. the social condi-tiona of the mining- communities of Great Britain&apos;.SP    Ko Government could contemplate tho purchase of the coal mines as long as tho financial burden on the State is as heavy as it is now, quite apart from any question of the dosir-ability of nationalizing tho coal mines.3, The Govor.ome.nt are opposed to Sate management of coal-mines on a basis similar to that adopted in the nationalisation of tho Postal, Telegraph and the Telephone Services.4.     The Government are. opposed to the control of the coal mining industry by tho miners alone that is to the syn&amp;ieaiiza-tion of the mining industry.5,     The Government&apos;accept the criticisms of the -Commission upon the present methods of operating and controlling the nines., They agree that there;is not, sufficient consultation with tho miners, whose lives depend on the way in which the mines are worked and they consider that means must be devised for securing their co-operation in the working of the. mines.   This object
wmust&apos; bo secured, however, without impairing the executive controlof the management of individual mines,6-    The Government have approved the following six principleswith regard to the future organization of the coal industry.i.     The organization must secure the maximum technical efficiency and production,ii.     It must meet the national interest in regard to the export trade in coal which must be so organized that it is carried- on as a commercial undertaking and not- as a diplomatic affair *iii.     It must meet the consumers interest in regard to adequate supplies at such cost as will enable our export trade in manufactured goods to be maintained and extended.iv.     It must;meet tho managers&apos;, technical supervisors&apos; and workers1&apos; interest&apos; so that, individual energy and ambition are stimulatedo   Squally it must secure a reasonable standard of living to workers in. the industry and to their families.v.     It must be such that in the non-commercial management of the mines representatives of all sections and grades, of persons engaged in coal mining have their interests fairly represented and considered.,vi) The transition from the present to the future organiza-tion must be so arranged that the credit and financial stability of the country is net impaired thereby..7,     The Government are in general agreement with the recommendation of most of the Commissioners in favour of uniting neighbouring mines in groups, in order to reduce the expenses of management and working charges, and to increase efficiency.   When these area groups have been formed all the workers in and about the mines should have a direct voice in the body controlling tho policy.   The status of the workers&apos; representatives on this body must be in all respects equal to that of other members.8.     The Government should have the power to veto any particular scheme of amalgamation which is clearly detrimental to the public interest.
9*     The Government must retain sufficient power over vtit? commercial activities of the industry to protect the public in their capacity as consumors from exploitation by the industry.10.    &quot;7hilG announcing these principles the Government arc not yet in a position to place before Parliament the precise methods by which they could be carried out,   An expert Committe will immediately be set up to work out a scheme on the above basis.11* A Committee will immediately bo set up to inquire into the diminution of output in tho coal minesB2j Whitehall Gardens, SeW, 7th August, 1919o
