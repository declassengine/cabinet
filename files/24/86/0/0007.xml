Mi Cartier de Marchienne,Maj or Beiilemans imet under the Chairmanship of M. Oartier de Marchienne, on the 39th, 30th and Slat July and the 1st, 2nd and 4th. August, 1919, and reports as follov/B :I.     GENERAL PRINCIPLES.During the course of the deliberations of the Committee, the 1^ following general principles emerged.(a) It was obvious that, each,of the Delegates or Assessors on the ConmilBsion should have National Organizations to advise them with regard to the purely national interests of the country concerned.(b) At the same time tie work cf the,ComniifjBion is inter-national and therefore it appears necessary that the various Experts of the different National Organizations should oonault together und prepare the material for the deliberations of the Commission.     It is therefore considered that various Inter-Allied Committees and Sub-Committees should be appointed to perform or prepare the work of the Commission,
Each of these Goml&amp;kMrtB or Sub-Committees should, have a j^airman J^Joe appointed to the. Commission,from amongst lLs^memberTlirK tfris chairman shoullTHave an Ex-ecutive Officer (who might be the Secretary of the Committee), t-a direct the operations of an Inter-Allied StaffProm these twfc considerations there emerges the f*llcw-ing scheme of organisation..The International and National organisations should be on the same plan.Each of the National organizations should be responsible to the Delegate or the Assessor on the Reparation Ccmmissifn cf the country concerned and the Chiefs of the various Technical Services of each Nation should represent their Government on the Inter-Allied Committees or Sub- Committees suggested.(c) In view of the fact that the responsibility for pay-ment of the expenses of the Commission devolves on the Governments of the Centra! Powers, it appears to be necessary that the various delegations should not be allowed a free hand in the appointment of personnel.   In the first place if one of the Governments represented had an Insufficient organization, it might paralyse the functioning of the whole Commission, while, at the same time, if one Govern-ment developed an unnecessary organization it would in-crease the Establishment costs of the Commission (which is obviously to be avoided).Appointment of the Ohlef Delegates and the Principal Officials,It is obviously too early to estimate definitely the personnel required, but it would appear that the follsw-ing, general rule might be employedThe American, British, French,Italian and Belgian delegations shall have the right to,appoint the same number cf officials and it is considered necessary that they should have at least one permanent official to serve on each of committees or Sub-Committees suggested in this report; the number of the officials to bo appointed by the other Allied Governments could be determined later on by the Commission.(d) In view of the fact that thera s ould be an equitable distribution cf the Chairs of the various Committees and ofthe Directorates of the various depending Adrain-ist^ations between the different Nations, it is considered that all these nominations or appointments should be madeby the Commission.(e) As the method of voting and the representabion *f tin various countries on the Reparation Commission is definitely laid down in the Treaty of Peace with Germany, it is suggested that the various Committees and Sub-Committees pro-posed in this report should be firmed and should act en the s**me principles.(f) As it is necessary to ensure unity of actieh on the question of reparation, it is&apos; suggested that theprinciple
principle should he established that no National organization has the right to send Missions or Emissaries into enemy countries and. that any Mission sent out must go forth as the mandatory of the Reparation Commission as a whole.   &apos;(g).  After an examination of the question of appoint-ftments, allowances, expenses, etc. for- the Staff, it was decided that this question was outside the competence of the present Committee.   The Committee,, however, desire to express the opinion that as far as possible,, a uniform scale should be adopted, and should be announced as early as possible in order that staff may be&apos;appointed.. .&apos;  &apos;    , I1&apos;   SCHEME, OF ORGANIZATION.    .. The schedule attached to this report shows the scheme of organization Of the Reparation Commission suggested.   It con-slots of a General Secretariat and Services, which will usually function through several sections.   An attempt has beon made to brine ^-on n ^0 a mimimum the number of -subdivisions necessary, and it is considered that these have been reduced as far as. possible.A. SECRETARIAT...  .The Secretariat should be a Committee of the Secretaries of the different National organizations which would meet at regular and frequent intervals for the decision of all pending questions..The Commission should nominate a General Secretary, who need not necessarily be one of the members of the.

Secretariat would be responsible for all the ordinary Secretarial duties of the Commission, preparation-of Agenda,&apos; Minutes, Establishment, Registry, Correspondence and Liaisan with other International bodies.   It *s considered that it should be definitely enunciated that all correspondence with enemy powers should be despatched and received by the General Secretariat. Naturally, the despatch and receipt of the correspondence of each Of the National organisations is not included in this recommendation and it is considered that diplomatic privileges would naturally be granted for this correspondence.   It is recommended that the General Secretary should, &quot;he appointed by the,.Commission for one year, but that he should be eligible for re-appointment.B. SERVICES AND DIVISIONS,--Each of.the Interallied Services of the Commission should be controlled by a Committee consisting of
art the Heads of the2&amp;chnioal services o once me d of tho-.-- 1 (&apos;,Cj various National organisations.Tho Chairman of oaoh Committee should he appointed by the Commission for one year but should be eligible for re-appointment.    Ee should have attached to him an Executive Officer (who might in certain cases be: the Seoretary), whose duty it would be to see that the decisions of the Committee were carried out and that the routine work was performed.In order to secure the proper type of personnel and continuity of policy it is suggested that the appoint-mafc of those officials should be for a considerable period.It is suggested that the Committees oontrolling the work of the Divisions organised for the purpose of carrying out the work of the Service should be on the same model and that their Chairman and officials should be appointed in the same manner and under the same conditions.    The Committees and Sub-Committees should meet regularly at fixed dates..(I) FINANCE SERVICE.-The Finance Service should consist of 3 Divisions(a) treasury Division.

It is suggested that this Division should be organised into 2 Sub-Divisions. N(l)   for the valuation of goods.,(2)   for the valuation of securities, concessions &amp;o.(III) RESTITUTION AM) REPARATION IN KIND SERVICE*This Service should contain 5 Divisions.(a)  destitution and Reparation of objects of artistic, historic or scientific interest (these,two functions are combined because the first has naturally a limited duration and the -second adheres closely to the first.&apos; (b)-4-
(&quot;b)   Agriculture&apos; and Agricultural Machinery Division.(c) Labour and Supplies Division (to include indus-trial machinery, construction material and all reparation commodities not covered by any other section).(d) Mercantile Marine and Cables (includingriver-craft). 11 4(e) Coal and Chemical Division.
