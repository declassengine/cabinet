Sir,X am directed to enquire, if you can favour mo wiiijh an$ information as to the conclusions come to by Great Britain and the Allied and Associated Powers in regard to the future employment in warfare of &amp;sphyx* fating or other gases.In this connection it is not clear, from the wording of Article 171 of the Peace Treaty with Germany, If the&quot;use of asphyxiating gases etc. is prohibited in Germany in particular, or if their manufacture and importa-tion into Germany are prohibited, owing to their being a general prohibition against their universal use.I should be glad if this point could be made clear.I amSir,Your ob e di e nt S e rvant,(SgC.)
