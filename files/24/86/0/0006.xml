The interim trade policy now in operation expires on September 1st.    The results hoped for have been attained.    Trade has restarted and employment is rapidly improving.    But the policy cannot be safely continued. It is fall of defects, which increase with the lapse of time:   and the recovery of trade has boon followed by a problem of hf$i prices, to which import restrictions * contribute.    Moreover, it is now essential to remove as far as possible the feeling of uncertainty about the future whioh hampers trade in an increasing degree ae producers are forced to look further ahead and further afield.After surveying the eoonomio outlook, I am convinced that it la necessary to put forward a compre-tensive scheme.    It is not to he expected that ono or two trifling measures will suffice after five years1 diversion from normal economic activities and the loss and. dislocation which has been suffered in so many countries.Ihe policy that I recommend is briefly described below.   Two fundamental ideas may be emphasised.iIn the first place it may be remarked that export must be a prime consideration.    Before the war we were far more dependent upon exports that other countries, and today we have to make good losses of imports due to sales of securities abroad, and to provide for the new claims created by our borrowings abroad.    Very roughly speaking (for exact calculations are impossible) we must bring our export (apart from re-exports) as near as we can to  100,000,000 a month.   In no recent month since the war have they reached  70,000,000, and the average is materially less.    And wc must do this with an improver!shed and largely disorganised Europe.In taio second place - and partly as a consequence of this - much greater efficiency all round, and particularly in basic and key industries, is a vital need, whioh reduced hours and higher wages make the more insistent.    Special efforts are called for after a period in whioh our energies could not be devoted mainly to general productive equipment.The details of the policy that I recommend ara as follows:-
(1) jS^SmiOjOTOj^ exjsep1fltr**o far-assoine borrowing may for a ^IHe oelnecesaary to ^prevent the complete collapse of any important Exchange.    At present they are being supported mainly&quot; by borrowing from the United States,   The effect is that imports from the United States are encouraged.    The further fall of the American Exchange would be egfu.ival.ent to an import duty 1 on goods from U,,3.A3    Also it would stimulate our exports to the United States, end our exports to other countries. -would tend to be stimulated also, while our imports would probably suffer discouragement, because a further depreciation of the pound sterling in terms of the dollar would tend to be followed by a fall in its value in terms of other currencies.&apos;21 &amp;J3^1$&amp; of ffio&amp;s manufactured in Groat Britain, anfl Ireland aiaTniiT-o iteming,by presenting the &quot;sale in this country of similar go off s beneath their price in the oountry of orlgfcuit) ypeterlnj^the Unstable Key fcdttstries^     By Pivotal ox  ey Indue tries are me&amp;ntTranche s of pr cducti on which, though Of tfelfctively small magnitude in themselves, are, nevertheless, at great insignificance, since they produce commodities upon which larger and important industries are in a great measure dependent.    With reference to these industries, the follow-ing proposals are made:-.$he Board of Trade should schedule any such industry whenthe necessity arisesi and be empowered to prohibit the import except on licence of the products of an industry so scheduled, &quot;in order to prevent an excessive profit from Vr. toeing obtained by the importer, in caeee/wSich the import price is considerably lower than the price ruling in this country, feeo should be charged for licences. In tho fixing of these fees regard should be had to the diffor-encos between the prices at which the articles can he imported and the prices at which similar articles are sold in tho United Kingdom.    It is not i..\t.-intended^ however, that the fees should be varied frequently, but that in each case a fee should be fixed which is likely, in all the circumstances of fcM case, to toe suitable for a lengthy period.    Finally, recommend- -ations should be made by the Board in regard to industries which, in their opinion, may require, in addition, financial assistance.It is not anticipated that the list of scheduled 2ey Industries mil oe a lengthy one.    At ihe moment, the Board of Trade have in mind the industries producing the following:-
Synthetic dyes     fa scltems&quot;&quot;^^tiag to which isalready in oper&amp;fajm);3yntketia^rganie- flno chemicals: .Optical glass:leases, prisms, and like optical defioes:Hosiery latch needles: Potash compounds:$&quot;ungsten powder and ferro-tungsten: Magnetos.la the case of these industries, it is intended that the Board of Trade should maintain an effective supervision^ or perhaps beccsae associated with the direction, with a view to promoting thair effloiesacy and securing their independence at the earliest possible date.(4) protect!on of other irnstaele EsBential InfostffeauClosely related to, and&apos; in some dogree&quot; overlapping the unstable &amp;ey indastriftB are other essential industries which, for a variety of reasons, are, at present, in a precarious position.    The list of such .   industries th&amp;t should now he recommended for tariff protection, accompanied by supervision, need not he a long one*    $he articles which thp Board have at present in mind and the rates ad valorem proposed are given . below.    Different rites are suggested for different classes of goods under each heading, and the rates given-, show their range- -&apos; ..v Chemical glass 50$Illuminating glassmre aatie* varying 85$ to 75$fromChemical porcelain 50^Specified classes of electrical )  *    25$ -  50$ plant, apparatus and fittings )Specified classes of scientific    ) ,   .(including optical) and surgical) &quot;  250/* -  50f* instruments )Rubber tyres 33^t?2inc oxide, and lithopona Zf$Jhorium nitrate * ,v S5$4Gas mailt las and mantle rings 25$Gauges of specified kinds and)        *  25$ -  50$ dividing engines )j
Tt should ho noted that inoidditicnriibe following ertlr^s, outside the group cf &quot;food, drink and tobacco&quot;, are a^-sady suhjo-ct to import duties:- motor oars, including motor ir-cycClas and trioyelea, accessories, and component parsii thereof: matches and&apos;mechanical lighters; cinematograph--fiJias; musical instruments, and accessories and component parts thereof.&apos;S^ie^9-2^2 e-^^io&quot;. with weak essentialJLndustries. The so inivmicxSa might include any 6T^osa&quot;eeSe.duXed above, but they would also include a very limited number of others in the case of which protection by tariffs or licensing of imports was unsuitable.    Consultation between the Board of 3;rade and representatives of the industry concerned, with a view to the drafting of a scheme for submission to the Cabinet, if one were found necessary, would be the first step.    Of the limited number of industries that I have in mind, iron and steel and organic chemicals stand out prominently.    Both groups are vital for purples of defence and as the basis of modern industry; and both are in an eminently unsatisfactory position.    Something was done hy tho state during the war, but very much remains to be done,  esaer, hut, nevertheless, Important industries which call for consideration are Spelter and Copper Befining.I now propose that the Government should act on a systematic and&apos; comprehensive plan.    Effective action clearly involves the assumption by the State of part of the financial responsibility for the xe-organieation and development of the industries concert; and either its association with the direction of the industries, so as to secure that the purposes in view are achieved^ or the laying down of conditions of assistance and the maintenance of supervision.With regard to these threO Industries, tariff protection, unsupported by positive action, would be hopelessly inadequate.    It would give no guarantee of reform in methods of production and organisation; and it might even have the effect of stereotyping obsolete methods.    Moreover, it would necessarily be complicated and would involve far-reaching ramifications; and the industries in question are of such a basic character that the reactions upon other industries in this country are almost impossible to foresee.    In the case of Iron ajtft Steel, for instance, dutioe would have to he charged not merely on iron and steel material, but also on the manufactured imports into which iron and steel entered.    Otherwise, manufacturers here would rightly complain that their material was taxed, while they had. to compete against goods made from untamed material.    Draw-fcacks on export of goods into whioh iron and steel entered would have to be introduced for similar reasons.5?he alternative to a constructive policy of co-operation would, therefore, seem to be to leave things as they are. Conceivably, reconstruction and expansion might be undertaken without State co-^oration; but I fear there is little oaaaoe of its being carried out on the required scale.    Af*ser f:ive years lost through the War, there is a grave danger o* germane-, or long-enduring inefficiency in the vary foundations of our industrial system.
i n&apos; 1k Or ganla at ion m of Power ,Pr odnot J. on.    This is^jutf&amp;her^integTfdjjjfen; of a oouipTeTeT^which will become of inoreaa i ng lmportaiica.    A BilJisTiOw before Parliament with regard to electric power and a Bill wUh. m regard to the oontrol and development of water-power is also    \ being brought forward.   Other schomes relating to power-production may in addition be advisable8Jeohnioal,,in,truotion.    The human-aide calls for immediate aiteiitionTn any&quot;satIkfactcry^scheme for the pro-motion of efficiency.    Advance must be made lnjreepeot of the training, not only of skilled workmen^ but also of managers, : and not the least difficult step will be sejruring that full -use is made of the facilities offered.  &quot;The Preaidentj)f the Board of ISducation has suggested -(a) That a report should be drawn upon the higher gredeh teohnioal need  of each of the principal industries of the country by a committee representative of the Boar^of Education, the Board of Trade, the Ministry of Labour    -and the Department of Scientific and Industrial Researoh, with representatives of the industries concerned.    Such a report would show up the many deficiencies and. gaps 1 in our present organisation of higher technical education^.(b) That the Whitley Councils should be requested to fprm subcommittees upon lower grade technical education, i*$. the education of workmen and managers.   These Whltley sub-committees should be brought into connection with the Technical Committees of the Local Sduoation Authorities.;(o)   That the Local Education Authorities should be en- &apos;/&quot; oouraged to take advantage of Clause 6 in the Aot of 1919, and should submit to the &quot;Board of MucaJUjon^schemes for , technical education in particular-branches of hco^geneOus economio areas, e.g. coal fields.    This    ought to be parlL, of the general plan to encourage contributions from-the&quot; industries.;&apos;    tj      :3?he President of the Board of Education anticipates, moreover, considerable benefit generally from the formation of researoh associations under the Department of Scientific and Industrials Researoh and from the establishment of continuation schools under the Aot of 1918, but balieves that the prime necessity at present is so to impress employers with the advantages of technical eduoation as to induce them to make full use of : existing facilities.(8)   Promotion of Industrial Researoh and Invention. I A beginning has been&apos;made at promoting industrial rosoaroh, but further efforts are noeded along the general lines already laid down.   !Ehe patents bill now before Parliament should have the effect of encouraging the taking up and use of Inventions *
1 tt1^   f?]    ^^ BS^J^j^^Mpton .      Kmro la mowing   &apos; recognition-ox ohe importance ror The future of Britlnh Industry of T?ne principle and practice, of Standardisation.      The essential are (aj   The nuthoritative determination in respect of materials ?5v Slfv ?fv-ffe,most suitable standards of quality and performance: (b) Jho establishment of uniformity of specification by the adoption, ao far as practicable, of the Standards thus authori-* tatively determined, and the consequential Standardisation and economy ox production;     (c) 2he cotabil&amp;imttit of an efficient system of testing.So far the State has done little, except to save some finan-cial assistance to the work of the Engineering Standards Ar*social-tion.      If standardisation is to be extended, it must be directly encouraged, and testing must be done by institutions recognised by the Government as impartial and efficient, the marks consequent-ly having the Government imprimatur.    The matter is of special moment in connection with a scheme which has been put for-ward by the interests concerned for the establishment of a National Electrical Proving House,      It is also important in connection with the testing of chemical glass and gauges which has been carried on during the war on a large scale at the national Physical laboratory- . tory.      It is eminently desirable that a Department of Standards should be sot up at the Board&apos;of Trade (i) to promote and co-ordin-ate standardisation generally, and for this purpose to co-operate with, and assist financially, if necessary, such bodies as the tEngineering Standards Association:       (iii to establish and a&amp;ainister such Tosting Institutions as may be found necessary, and authorise and, so far as may be required, supervise the test-ing work carried out by Technical Institutions, Trade Organisa-tions or private concerns.      The Government Testing Institutions should be self-sustained, at least, after the early stages, deriving their revenue from fees.Co-oporation with industry to ensure the provision of rew materials and f os^er Inge rial supplies. A policy QJLIndustrial security&quot;should clearly keep under review supplies of raw material and aim at developing, so far as possible, the sources -under British control.     Mud. -:o :i: of t.:ie i:ind hae cliv&amp;dy been commenced during the war.     As regards flax for instance, work has been done during the war by the        Control Board in respect of Flax Sued production in Canada, and  he extension and improve-ment of tl&amp;x-growiag in Irolaad, and by the Bo-rd of Agrieul.im.ta&apos; in respect of flax-growing in Great Britain;   and investigations are now being carried on by the Umpire Flax Growing Committee, established by the Board of Trade.    As regards Cotton, Govsrn-ment assistance has already been given to the British Cotton Grow-ing Association, and for the development of cotton growing in the Sudan, and the farther steps necessary to promote cotton-growing within the Kwpire are being considered by the Tmpire Growing Committee established by the Board of Trade, on which the other Governments of the Iforr-ire and of the cotton growing and using interests are represented.      2or this, funds are required, and it is recommended that any profits under the Esypti&amp;n cotton buying echeme at the disposal of the British Government should be*allocated to this purpose. regards Potash and OpticalMunitions,   the Glassware md. Potash Production Department of the Ministry of Monitions has devoted considerable effort to establishing home production.      As regards Minerals, the Imperial Mineral Resources Bvreau, representative of all the Governments of the Franire, has been established to secure the systematic collection of information as to the Empire&quot;s resources and to aaviSJ the Governments of the Efor.ire as to the development of surveys on a systematic and comprehensive plan.      Provision must be made for mr-ft cumulate survevs in the United Kingdom itself.
(IX) Development of Agriculture.  A policy of efflolenoy and security cannot begin and end with industry apart from agriculture,  national efficiency must be rooted In national health, and is bound up with a proper balance between rural and urban occupations. Consequently, agricultural efficiency it involved, and the part played by agriculture in the national economy. This raises too large a problem for adequate notice here, but regarding it solely from the industrial side, this observation may be made.   The war allotments have disclosed an innate desire to cultivate land in a con-siderable proportion of townsmen,  provision must be made, not only to satisfy that desire but to allow it to develop by creating, in the vicinity of all towne, cottage holdings to which are attached an area of land, large enough for the practice of a supplementary agri-cultural or horticultural business, but small enough to be within the compass of the spare time of the wage-earner.   As the industries tend to move out of the highly-rated urban areas, the opportunity for setting up these cottage holdings will arise.   The holders of allotments and cottage holdings are all potential small holders, and from them and their sons will be derived new recruits for larger farming.(12). Improved Communications both internally and between all parts of the Empire, whether shipping, postal, cable, or wireless.   The external part of this policy is essential for the consolidation of the Bmpire, the development of the natural resources of the overseas parts of the Empire, and the incresed sale in theee markets of goods from the United Kingdom.  Economic, political and defensive ends would be furthered.   On a resolution of the Imperial War Conference an Imperial Investigation Board is at present being constituted, representing His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Dominions, together with shipping and commercial representatives to inquire into and report on all matters connected with ocean freights and facilities, and and all matters con-nected with the development and Improvement of the sea communications between the different parts of the Umpire, with special reference to the size and type of ships and the capacities of harbours.   (Three of the Dominions, viz., Australia, South Africa and Newfoundland have already selected their representatives).(13). Improved Registration of Imports (including those brought by parcelpost). This is designed to secure more accurate and more detailed returns to serve as a basis for anti-dumping measures and to shew he^cea-petition stands with reference to any particular British industry. It is proposed that the fee charged should be one per milie ad valorem.(14) * Power to prohibit importation of goods ef enemy origin except on licence^ Provision for the.exclu-eion of goods of enemy origin except on licence precautionary measure to guard against any flood of German goods that might result from pressure of the German need of this means of making foreign payments. Without some such precaution, moreover, Prance might pay her debts and interest on her debts by buying and re-exporting cheap German goods.   The mark has depreciated in terms of the puuad sterling, more than cost ofproduction
production in Germany has-risen, in very many instances, with the result that German exports will be stimulated.(15) Restoration of trade, with,,disorganl^e^jparjs&apos; of Europe. At pre-war values, our&quot;&quot;exporti*of the produce manufactures of the United Kingdom to the European -belligerent countries other than France,&quot;Belgium. Italy ; and Portugal amounted to about  75,000,000 (of which Germany accounted for about  40,000,000) while our total exporta to Europe as a whole were as much as  180,000,000. Insurance of goods in trade with 8.2.Russia, has already been arranged, and the application of the scheme can be extended.   Also a scheme le now under consideration for the furnishing of credits by the Government with some guarantee against risks in approved cases in which pay-,, meat oannot be immediately made either in bills or goods though security can be given.   As a result of State action in this direction, a beginning will he made in restoring trade connections, and it is hoped that banking houses will be encouraged to play a larger part in what has to be done.(16) Promotion of Export Trade.   Government action, through Consular and Commercial Attache&quot; Services, and otherwise, to secure or develop markets overseas, is required.   The encouragement of exports is urgently needed in view of the large sales of our foreign securities, our borrowings abroad, the disorganised or impoverished state of most European markets, and the fact that in others we start with the handicap of having to win back our place.(17) Protection against harmful combination.. The safeguarding of1 the public and the&apos; economic system against the effects of domestic and international business comblna-tions, so far as they prove harmful, is obviously called for.   Combinations of various kinds, particularly for the regulation of sales, prices and output, had become a notable feature even before the War, and during the War they hade been fostered.   In many respects the results may be benefioial, but the guarantee of competition that prices and profits shall not continue for long at unreasonable rates is removed.   There would seem to be m doubt that the Board of Trade will be expected to hold a watching brief on behalf&quot; of the public, and have powers to make, or cause to be made, any thorough investigations that may be needed, both as a warning to combinations that their operations are not being disregarded and as a preliminary to taking action in time if it should become advisable.   The pro-cedure recommended by the Committee on Trusts, with some possible modifications, appears to be on the right lines.(18) Collection of Information about production,frl oe s, c o 31 g &quot;c rid &quot;pro fi t aIn order to carry out effect-vely the essential parts of the industrial and commercial policy outlined above, and to meet the demands that may be expeoted for fuller economic information, it is proposed(a)
(a) that the collection of information regarding the movement of prices and the cost of living should be continued and developed.(ft) that power should be given to investigate costs of production and distribution in the scheduled key and other essential industries and in any other cases in which it was found desirable.(c) that the information received through the Census of Production should be expanded in some respects, in particular so as to include capital and profits, and that the more import-ant portions of this information should fre   . secured annually and made available, with certain restrictions, for Government depart-meats *
