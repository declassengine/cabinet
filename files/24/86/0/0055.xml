Since they were last before the Cabinet on July 4th, they have been the subject of further consideration and negotiation with the Provisional Joint Committee of the Industrial Conference, and they represent an agreement with that body on all but one point of substance.   The understanding is that the Bills should be introduced before the recess, whereupon the Employers&apos; and the Trade Union representatives Trill take steps towards forming the Employers&apos; and the Trade Union sides of the National Industrial Council.   I am, therefore, anxious to introduce both bills without delay, but it will be necessary to obtain a first Reading before the recess.Hours Bill, As the Cabinet will remember, they decided when the question was last before them that Agriculture should be excluded, and that the question of hours in Agriculture sh6uld be referred to the Royal Commission now sitting.   The Trade Union side of the Joint Committee passed a resolution declining to accept this decision, but I do not think that they will press their objection to the point of refusing to undertake the responsibility for the Bill, expecially as the Labour members of the Royal Commission have now agreed to the inclusion of hours with reference to cost of production in the Terms of Reference *The Joint Committee also pressed that the railways should be included within the scope of the Bill.   I do not think that , there is any strong objection to this, as the Railways are already wprking on an eight hours&apos; day and it will be possible for the Minister to give effect to any railway agreements in substitution for any of the provisions of the Bill.   Moreover, to omit railways would^weaken our position at the Washington Conference.The other alterations which have been made do not involve any. question of principle, except that an amendment has been made in clause 6, which makes any contrsirerition of the provisions of the *ct an offence, including the employment of persons beyond the statutory working week.   Both sides are, however, agreeable to this, so that no Objection need be taken to it.   The Trade Union side also objected to the exclusion of the Police, but they are not disposed to press this point.Wages Bill.    There are only a few verbal alterations, apart from Clause 3 where an amendment has been introduced atthe/
the request of the Employers, ,to&apos; which the Trade Unions raise &apos; no objection, that, the Commission should only have power to examine Employersf&quot;t books through &apos; an Accountant / .and the latter should not lay before them all the figures of individual firms,(Signed) R.S., Jiorne. /Ministry&apos;.of..
