[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]794 7Printed for the War Cabinet.   August 1919.POLICY TOWARDS EUSSIA.I CIRCULATE this draft despatch on our policy towards Russia which I have prepared in accordance with the instructions of the Cabinet last week. The details of expenditure still require to be inserted.C. op K.August 9,1919.Foreign Office, August    , 1919His Majesty&apos;s Government are once again compelled to bring to the immediate attention of the Allied and Associated Powers the serious menace to a lasting inter-national settlement which is caused by the present situation in Russia and the course that events are taking in that country.The recent untoward developments in North Russia, following so closely on the forced evacuation of -Odessa and the Crimea and the reverses suffered by the armies of Admiral Koltchak, have brought matters to a head and have produced a situation differing in many respects from that which has hitherto confronted the (j-overn-ments concerned. It is one requiring renewed and urgent consideration. His Majesty s Government desire in consequence to pass that situation in review and at the same time to propose for general acceptance a new method of dealing with it.There has been, it is true, no fundamental divergence of opinion between the Powers as to the principles applicable to the Russian problem, or even to the general means of their application. But the practical absorption of the Powers in the work of arriving at a settlement with Germany has inevitably diverted attention from the equally pressing need of regularising their position with regard to Russia, and there has consequently been a tendency to allow the efforts made to become individual and spasmodic, a tendency which has possibly contributed to the somewhat barren results that are apparent to-day. The difficulties of dealing with Russia are universally admitted, but the failure to find a satisfactory solution has been largely increased by the lack of efficient machinery to do so. It is this defect which His Majesty&apos;s Government now desire to remedy, since they have grave reason to fear that, without more co-ordinated procedure, the immense efforts and expenditure that have already been made will have been thrown away and the Powers will be forced to admit complete bankruptcy in respect of their Russian policy. Unity of direction as well as of purpose have become a prime necessity. -It is essential in making any fresh proposal for dealing with Russian affairs to start with a clear definition of the motives which originally prompted and those which still justify Allied intervention. Not merely must the interested Governments, themselves see clearly the direc-tion in which events are likely to carry them, but, if they are to pursue this policy without impediment, the [554] ^ B
dangerous misapprehensions which prevail in certain sections of public opinion in nearly all the Allied countries must be dissipated. The issues have largely tended to become confused in the course of the last two years, and, unless it is fully realised and explained why the Powers originally undertook and are still prosecuting this great commitment, the whole enterprise may come to an abrupt and disastrous termination.Military intervention by the Allied- and Associated Powers in Eussia was originally an exclusively war measure. Its object was a reconstitution of the Eastern front, with a view to prevent the acquisition by the German armies of the material and supplies of which they had been deprived elsewhere. It was not merely designed to re-establish the blockade where it had been broken by the Russian defection, but it also aimed at denying to our enemies the vast resources of human material which might have become available to them. Those Russian forces which were still prepared to assist in carrying out this task necessarily remained the Allies of the Western Powers, and it was therefore to the interest of the Powers no less than of the russian forces mentioned that the latter should be afforded all the assistance that was possible. The occupation of Archangel and Murmansk was likewise a war measure directed against Germany, though of a somewhat different nature from the intervention just described, inasmuch as it aimed primarily at keeping a door open through which the Allies could have access to North Russia, at prevent-ing the establishment by the Germans of a submarine base in.the Arctic, and at protecting vast accumulations of warlike stores from falling into enemy hands.With the signature of peace with Germany the problem has entered upon a new phase; and public opinion in all the Allied countries concerned is no longer satisfied with the old explanations. The heavy legacy of the war, which survives in the Russian entanglement, and the proposed means of liquidating it, require to be re-examined in the light of the changed conditions in Europe, and an answer given to the question now being generally asked, whether and why, the German military power being broken, intervention in Russia is any longer necessary.There will no doubt be general agreement among the Powers that the hostilities which are still In progress between the forces of the Allied Governments and those of the Soviet Government do not imply and are not intended to imply a state of war between Russia and her former Allies. Nor do they indicate that the Allied Governments have any desire to interfere in the affairs of another country, or to dictate to its people the form of government which would be most convenient even from the international point of view. They are directed neither against Bolshevism as such, nor against the Russian masses who either support or acquiesce in the present Soviet Administration. They are partly inspired by obligations and responsibilities towards those Russians :who have trusted the Allies and thrown in their lot with ;them. They are also partly in the nature of defensive measures designed-to preserve the fruits of victory by preventing, or at least restricting, the spread of apolitical conflagration which is capable, if unarrested, of nulli-fying its results not over Russia alone, but over vast contiguous areas of the European continent.
The military power of Germany has been effectually broken. But a distracted and enfeebled Russia provides a field indeed, the only available field where recuper-ation is possible from the losses which she has sustained. Modern German opinion does not conceal the hope that compensation for the loss of the old German colonies may be found in the creation of a new and vastly greater colony, namely, Russia herself; and it is in the nature of things that the new German diplomacy will be in the main directed to the economic and political penetration of that country, with all the political and military consequences that it may ultimately entail. Although this has been for long a commonplace of European speculation, the moment is now arriving when definite effect may be expected to be given to this policy. The time may even he not far distant when it will be too late to check the course of events. In these circumstances, the Allied Governments must without delay make up their minds whether they can afford to allow Germany to exercise a predominant influence in shaping the future of Russia, and must agree upon a form of action which will be decisive for or against that result.Bolshevik Russia, as it now is, a prey to internal disunion and disintegration, must ultimately be defenceless by itself before a predatory Power bent on taking advantage of every weakness and every dis-sension. All the evidence at present available suggests that behind the undoubted military strength of the Bolshevik armies there are few elements of political permanence and stability capable of creating a serious barrier against exploitation from without. A Govern-in ent that is contemptuous of its obligations and, with its doctrine of subversive propaganda abroad, actively aggressive to the outside world, can never produce the international confidence which is requisite to internal strength. Thus a radical transformation of the whole system, whether it comes about through a conversion of the existing rulers of Bolshevik Russia to a normal sense of international comity or through their replacement by others, must precede any healthy resumption of relations between Russia and the Allied Powers. Only so can the latter rely on an orderly reconstitution of the country which will furnish a solid guarantee against its unchecked penetration by a, single Power and a real security that the results of the war are not thrown away.The motives, therefore, of the present and continued intervention of the Powers in Russia are twofold: a sense of obligation to those whom they have encouraged and who are still in the main dependent on their support; and the duty of self-preservation, namely, the avoidance in JKurope of a situation which at no distant date may lead to a renewal of the conflict from which we have, only just emerged.The situation in Russia as it exists to-day may be thus described: Early in the present year His Majesty&apos;s Government decided to withdraw before the coming winter the military forces which had been despatched in August 1918, for purposes already mentioned, to Murmansk and Archangel. At the time when this decision was reached it was hoped that it would be possible to leave the Northern Provisional Government in a position to maintain itself after the evacuation by the Allied forces had been completed, and in order to secure this result it was agreed that contact should be established between
the forces of the Northern Provisional Government and those of Admiral Koltchak operating from Siberia. For this purpose His Majesty&apos;s Government despatched relief forces to Archangel, hoping thereby to facilitate the necessary advance by the forces of the Northern Provisional Government to Kotlas and Viatka, where -a junction with the Siberian forces was expected. This operation has failed owing to the series of reverses sustained by Admiral Koltchak, and it is now apparent that when Murmansk and Archangel are evacuated by the Allied forces, the Northern Provisional Government will cease to exist. Recent developments in North Russia, notably the desertion of appreciable numbers of the forces of the Northern Provisional Government to the Bolsheviks, have decided His Majesty&apos;s Government to complete the evacuation at the earliest possible moment, and arrangements are now being made to that effect. When this has been accomplished one of the fronts hitherto maintained against the Russian Soviet Government will disappear.In Siberia the situation has undergone a decided changelbTTthe worse. Some months ago the prospects of Admiral Koltchak appeared to be promising. Recognition of his Government had long been pressed for by the Allied representatives at Omsk as a solution of many of his difficulties and as calculated to consolidate his power. It was not, however, till June of this year that an exchange of notes took place between the Allied Powers and Admiral Koltchak, and even then all that the latter undertook was the continuance of support to him on certain conditions. This action on the part of the Powers was, at first, generally interpreted in Siberia as a formal recognition of the Omsk Government, and its immediate result was to increase the prestige of Admiral Koltchak, and to produce a very considerable rise in the value of the rouble. But when it was realised that the step taken by the Powers did not involve recognition, but merely &quot; continuance of support,&quot; the reaction was correspondingly marked. Admiral Koltchak has lately suffered a series of disastrous reverses and his forces are still reported to be in full retreat.The situation has not been eased by. the action of the Omsk Government in the administration of its internal affairs, and there is evidence that the dissatisfaction which has been created will assume dangerous propor-tions unless the Allied Governments can assist in stabilising the position, and can exercise the necessary pressure on Admiral Koltchak to conform his policy to principles acceptable not only to the Allied Governments, but also to public opinion among the populations whom he rules or aspires to rule.In South Russia the position is more favourable. Though driven back in the spring of this year by the Soviet armies, General Denikin has recently succeeded in inflicting numerous severe reverses on the forces opposed to him and has made a deep advance into Russia. According to the reports which have been received, this advance has been welcomed by the population in the occupied territory, and there seems to be good ground for the belief that provided General Denikin can be assured of the necessary material assistance he will be able to establish his authority on a stable basis.Up to the spring of the present year, Allied troops were in occupation of Odessa and of considerable tracts
of territory surrounding that port. Their unfortunate withdrawal, however, in April, enabled the Soviet Government to establish themselves both at Odessa and in the Crimea, and to constitute a threat to General Denikin&apos;s flank in the Donetz basin. It is as yet too early to predict with any confidence whether this misfortune can be retrieved.The situation in the Ukraine is at present obscure. It is certain, however, that the authority of the Russian Soviet Government is not generally recognised in these areas, where an independent Ukrainian Government under the leadership of General Petlura claims to exercise jurisdiction. None of the Allied Governments has hitherto recognised General Petlura&apos;s authority, and there have been no dealings with his Government. His Majesty&apos;s Government have always regarded the Ukraine as an integral part of Russia, and they have felt very strongly that the utmost care should be taken to avoid any steps which might commit them to encouraging the separatist tendencies of certain sections of Ukrainian opinion. Economically the Ukraine can never be separated from Russia, and this must always be a predominant factor in considering Russo-Ukrainian relations.On the Western Russian front, Poland and the Baltic States of Lithuania^&quot; Latvia, and Esthonia, are conducting military operations against the Russian Soviet Government. So far as the Baltic States are&apos;concerned, continuance of their resistance depends largely on the amount of material assistance which they may be able to obtain, as well as upon the attitude which the Allied Governments may decide to adopt in regard to their national aspirations. Politically the present situation is in the highest degree unsatisfactory. His Majesty&apos;s Government have recognised the de facto authority of the Provisional Governments of Esthonia and Latvia established at Reval and Libau respectively, and the Allied representatives in Paris have, in the fifth condition s attached to the recognition of Admiral Koltchak laid down that &quot; if a solution of the relations between Esthonia, Latvia, Lithuania and the Caucasian and Transcaspian territories and Russia is not speedily reached by agreement, the settlement will be made inconsultationand co-operation with the League of Nations, and that, until such settlement is made, the Government of Russia agrees to recognise these territories as autonomous and to confirm the relations which may exist between their facto Govern-ments and the Allied and Associated Governments.&quot; Yet no further steps have been taken to endeavour to secure the co-operation of the Border States of Russia in the policy laid down by the Allied Powers, and no communi-cations have been addressed to the representatives of these States in Paris, in spite of their repeated requests to be informed of the intentions of the Allied Govern-ments. Grave dissatisfaction has consequently resulted in Latvia, Lithuania, and Esthonia. In the north of Esthonia a Russian corps, formed out of the relics of the old Russian Twelfth Army Corps, has been operating partly in conjunction with the Esthonian forces. This corps is badly in need of arms and material, but on the whole has succeeded in maintaining its position, The relations of the leaders of this corps with the Esthonians are not altogether satisfactory on account of the suspicions entertained by the Esthoniaiis concerning the &apos; &quot;    [554] &quot; C
intentions of the Great Russians ; but no breach has yet occurred, and the Esthonian forces have recently assisted the corps in meeting the attacks of the Russian Bolshevik forces on this front.In Eialand the situation is complicated. While certain Finnish leaders were strongly in favour of co-operating in the advance on Petrograd with the forces under the com-mand of GeneralJudenitch, a considerable and influential section of Finnish opinion has throughout been opposed to this course, unless the approval and assistance of the Allied Governments could first be secured. Loans and war material on a considerable scale have been solicited by the Finnish Government for this purpose. His Majesty&apos;s Government have not hitherto seen their way to do more than approve the agreement concluded between Generals Mannerheitn and Judenitch for an advance on Petrograd, and they have refused to assume the additional responsibility demanded by the Finnish Government.The lack of a clear and decisive policy has been not less manifest in the dealings with the Border States on the Caucasian front. Since the retirement of the German and Turkish forces from those regions, various republics, with a greater or less degree of encouragement from the Allied Powers, have there maintained an independent or quasi-independent existence. Of these the most con-siderable and the most promising has been the Republic of Georgia. The next in potential range and resources has been the Republic of Azerbaijan. Smaller groups have sustained a more precarious autonomous livelihood in Russian Armenia and in Daghestan; but of these it has been generally conceded that the former will in all proba-bility be incorporated in a larger Armenia, should such be created, while the latter has already to a large extent been absorbed in the area controlled by General Denikin&apos;s troops.Here, as elsewhere, the policy of the Allied Powers has hovered between recognition and polite indifference, and the efforts of the British representatives who have been in military occupation of this territory prior to a withdrawal, which is now on&apos; the eve of being carried out, have been mainly directed to the preservation of order, the avoidance of inter-Statal or inter-racial conflicts, the prevention of collision between the forces of the Republics and those of General Denikin, and the recognition by the latter of the incipient liberties of the various national groups.Although these Republics are in each case represented at Paris, and although it is understood that their future status is in the hands of the Peace Conference, no definite decision appears to have been reached as to the form of recognition to which they are entitled, or the degree of autonomy which they are to be permitted to enjoy. All is in flux and uncertainty, and with the withdrawal of the only Allied forces to the south of the Caucasus, serious disturbance, if not worse, may be expected to ensue.It will be seen from this brief survey of the situation on the various Russian fronts that, with the sole exception of South Russia where General Denikin is operating, the military situation is far from satisfactory. The almost complete collapse of Admiral Koltchak&apos;s army and the withdrawal from Archangel will release large Bolshevik forces and will enable the Soviet Government 10 throw them either south or west.against the fronts on which
most reliance has hitherto been placed. While there is no reason on that account to anticipate disaster in those quarters, yet it must inevitably weaken the hopes that were felt for a successful advance by the non-Bolshevik forces, and must postpone indefinitely a solution by military means of the main Russian problem. * It would be no doubt an unjustifiable deduction from the untoward developments that have taken place, to argue that they have been mainly due to lack either of political vision or harmony on the part of the Allied and Associated Powers. But it would not be unfair to attribute the set-back in part to the. fact that single Powers have, to a considerable extent, dissipated on various theatres such resources as they have been in a position to give to the whole, instead of pursuing an organised policy whereby effort could be concentrated and a due co-ordination established between political, military, and financial measures.In this respect His Majesty&apos;s Government feel it incumbent on them to submit a clear statement of the burden which they themselves have borne in Russia, more especially since the outbreak, of the Bolshevik revolution in November 1917.Their commitments in Russia date back indeed to a much earlier period, and it is public knowledge that the vast sums, which were contributed by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the form of loans to enable Russia to maintain her armies and prosecute campaigns against Germany in the early stages of the war, amounted to the prodigious figure of 560,000,0001., while the munitions and other materials and suppliesIt is, however, to the contributions made by this country, both in men and material since November 1917, that His Majesty&apos;s Government particularly desire to draw attention.In North Russia they have maintained forces of , have equipped the Russian forces, subventioned the finance, and provisioned the civilian population of the Northern Provisional Government, at a total cost of .   While this expenditure iseventually partly recoverable from the Allies, under various agreements which have been concluded, the initial cost has fallen practically entirely on the shoulders of His Majesty&apos;s Government.In Siberia they have equipped the forces of Admiral Koltchak, at a cost of ,  have maintained tworegiments in Western Siberia, and have shared in the expenses of the reorganisation of the Siberian Railway to the extent of assuming responsibility for expenditure on material for that railway to an amount of 4,000,000 dollars. They are at the present time main-taining a considerable staff for this purpose at the cost of approximately 10,00OL a month.In South Russia they have despatched material to General Denikin to a value of 20,000,0001, and have maintained forces in the Caucasus at a cost to the present date of , and naval forces in the black Sea and the Caspian Sea at a cost ofIn the Baltic they have furnished arms and material to the forces of Esthonia, Latvia, and the Russian Northern Corps at a cost of , in additionto maintaining strong naval forces in the Baltic and the Gulf of Finland at a cost for coal alone since the signature of the Armistice of 4,000,000Z.
As a result of all these efforts His Majesty&apos;s Govern-meiit have practically exhausted their resources in respect of war material, at the very moment when increased demands are being made upon them in Siberia, South Eussia, Poland, the Baltic States, and Finland.They feel therefore that the moment has arrived when, not merely in their own interests, but in view of the larger general considerations that have been already urged, a revised and more concerted arrangement is required among the Allied and Associated Powers as to their future political, military, and financial under-takings in Eussia. This arrangement must, they are persuaded, involve a reallotment or readjustment of the share which each Power may reasonably be asked to assume, and also a &quot;radical revision of existing methods if the future policy of the Allies as.a whole is to be rendered effective. .His Majesty&apos;s Government assume that, for the present, there is general agreement that assistance must be continued to those groups both inside and upon the borders of Eussia who are struggling to maintain their hard-won liberties, and although there can be no question of the further despatch of troops to the Western and Southern theatres, arms, munitions, and material of all kinds must continue to be sent to the various groups who are being supported by the Allied Governments.If this be accepted for the present as the guiding principle of Allied action, the choice would appear to lie between two courses. It might be possible to form an Allied fund into which each Power willing to contribute would, put his resources. Or alternatively and in the opinion of Plis Majesty&apos;s Government this is the more satisfactory solution the plan might be adopted of dividing Eussia into spheres of action for which individual Powers would, subject to a proportionate adjustment of the cost of the several undertakings, assume responsibility. In this case a more definite agreement than at present exists must be reached as to the particular spheres in which each individual should operate for the purposes of the common policy.The most convenient plan of effecting such a re-distribution of interest would be for the Powers in closest proximity to particular areas in Eussia to assume entire responsibility for those areas. In this order of ideas, Great Britain, France, and Italy might continue in conjunction to provide for the needs of General Denikin, the Baltic States, Poland, and Finland, while Siberia would properly fall within the sphere of America and Japan. Within the limits thus hypothetically pre-scribed, a further and more precise subdivision of interest might, if found practicable, take place.As regards the division of financial responsibility, His Majesty&apos;s Government are disposed to favour the establishment of a central fund for the Allies as a whole to which each would contribute. This fund would be jointly administered and-would be apportioned to the various theatres in Eussia as circumstances might require.These are the main principles which His Majesty&apos;s Government venture to suggest as governing the future arrangements of the Powers. When the situation comes to be examined in detail, the degree of responsibility of each Power for a particular area would require to be
exactly determined. What is important is that the -principles enunciated should be agreed to without delay, and that each Power should be at once released from responsibility for an area where its Allies are the predominant agent, and should consequently be free to concentrate its efforts on an area pre-eminently its own.The position of the Border States of Lithuania, Latvia, and Esthonia, and of the Caucasian Republics also calls for immediate examination, since on some solution of their relations to Admiral Koltchak and the groups which he represents may depend the further co-operation of these States in the operations against the Soviet Government, and in the last resort their own future- existence.There can be no doubt that these States view with grave apprehension and misgiving the intentions of the Great Russians as regards their national aspirations, and that the situation is greatly complicated by this fact.From independent enquiries which have been made by His Majesty&apos;s Government, it appears that pro-vided Russia is restored to a normal and orderly existence, and is prepared to act as a friendly neighbour, these States might be eventually willing to reconcile their interests with her on a federal basis.It would, however, be on their own terms and not on those of Russia that they would consent to enter any such federation, and this distinction in method cannot be made too clear. Any attempt on the part of the Russian authorities to lay down conditions of reunion of a coercive or centralising nature must inevitably alienate their sympathies and deter them from reconciliation. Both Admiral Koltchak and General Denikin must clearly recognise that the old order in Eastern Europe is past, and that, if any reconstitution . into a collective State of the former territories of the Russian Empire is to take place, it must be on the lines of a free federation into which the non-Russian nationalities will enter of their own accord with due guarantees for their individual autonomy. Only if assured of this, will it be possible to arrange a bond fide association during the present crisis between these small nations and the anti-Bolshevik forces now contending like themselves with the Soviet Government.It is possible that were the Allied Powers jointly to put forward a proposal for a solution on these lines the adherence both of the&apos; Russian groups and of the late Border Provinces of the Russian Empire might be secured. On the other hand; certain objections to this course have been raised on the ground that it is impos-sible at this stage either for the Allies or for individual Russian groups to foresee what the eventual political developments in Russia will be, and that it would be undesirable in these circumstances that the Allied Governments should commit themselves to any course which might prejudice the eventual settlement.Having regard to this undoubted objection, His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that the safest couise to pursue is to recognise the provisional independence of Latvia, Lithuania, Esthonia, and the Caucasian Republics, leaving the question of their future relations to Russia to be decided when a central Government is again in a position to speak on behalf of the Russian people. It is suggested that a communication in this sense might be made to the provisional Governments [554] .   . D
established in the various States, pointing out that, failing an agreement, the settlement as between them and Russia will be made eventually in consultation and co-operation with the League of Nations, and requesting their acquiescence in this procedure.Such a step might avail to satisfy the present aspira-tions of the Border States, while Admiral Koltchak and the groups which he represents could scarcely raise objections to a solution in strict accordance with the policy which the Allied Governments have already adopted towards him, and with the emphatic declarations which he himself has made.Such, then, is the basis of the policy which is proposed by His Majesty&apos;s Government for the eon-sideration of the Allied and Associated Powers. It is indeed the logical development of that which has hitherto been pursued. But while its object is to mitigate the- waste of individual effort through a better collective understanding, it proposes a greater precision of political aim with a view to bring into line the various forces which are directed, for differing reasons, towards the common aim. It deals, however, only with the situation in Russia as it exists to-day, and it may well be that before many months have elapsed that situation will have undergone a radical change, and that the Powers may then be faced with the necessity of having once more to reconsider their position. Furthermore, it is clear that the policy of intervention in Russia, even on the limited scale on which it has hitherto been conducted, cannot be continued indefinitely, and, even if there be no radical change in the situation, the time must come sooner or later when the whole question will have to be reconsidered.His Majesty&apos;s Government therefore are of opinion that it is not sufficient to come to an understanding on the lines indicated in this Note through the usual diplo-matic channels.   Nor are they disposed to think that the Peace Conference in Paris, absorbed as it is in manifold and momentous duties of another description, is the body best suited to deal with a kaleidoscopic situation demand-ing by its nature constant vigilance and often immediate action.    Delay has   perpetually   arisen   of late   in dealing with Russian affairs, and has frequently been responsible for creating an atmosphere of uncertainty and  a lack of cohesion   among the   non-Bolshevik elements   in   Eastern   Europe which   has  militated against success.   The division of executive authority among   the  Allied   Governments has   been   largely responsible for these consequences, and a more expeditious procedure must, it is thought, be introduced if events in Russia are to receive the prompt attention which they deserve. Accordingly His Maje,sty&apos;s Government propose, ( as a sequel to the argument which they have sought to develop in this despatch, the establishment ad hoc of an inter-Allied body.    They suggest that its head- j quarters should be in London, as the most, convenient f centre of operations.   Its functions would be to collect and co-ordinate all the information that can be obtained from and about Russia and the ex-Russian States; to ( watch narrowly the course of events ; to maintain a close j agreement between the Allied and Associated Govern-ments as  to their  political, military, and financial s operations; and to advise them in regard to the.action! which they should take as the situation in Russia; develops.
this Majesty&apos;s Government feel that no apology is needed for suggesting an innovation of this nature. The war has proved to the Allied Powers the necessity of a united front, political no less than military, if they are to keep pace with the rapid march of events. The Bolshevik system has, in common with the Prussian, a central direction as well as a ruthless executive. Therein lies its main strength; and it is only by adopting methods similar to those which they employed against Germany that the Powers can hope for a corresponding measure of success.Moreover, as regards Eussia, the enterprise on which the Powers have embarked, clearly does not aim at victory or conquest in the military sense of the term. The operations required for such an undertaking, even had it been desirable, would in any case have been iar too vast and too burdensome. The intervention of the Powers in Eussia, costly though it has been, never aimed at more than the introduction of order and good government by the russians themselves. . The control, therefore, of the situation is primarily political, and consequently requires a constant, and not merely a periodical, exchange of views, as well as a continued education of public opinion regarding the facts and necessary duration of inter-Allied action. Intervention should clearly not last one moment, longer than circumstances demand, and the policy of the Powers will need to be frequently readjusted to the changing conditions.It is with the object of gaining and maintaining a proper understanding of the Eussian situation in all its fluctuating phases, and of grappling with it effectively and without undue delays, that His Majesty&apos;s Government have made the foregoing proposal, and they feel confident that their Allies and associates will share with them the conviction that, unless all the sacrifices they have made for and in Eussia are to be&apos; rendered of no avail, a properly co-ordinated system of dealing with this com-complex problem has become a matter of the most urgent and vital necessity.
