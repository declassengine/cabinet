(This document, is the property of His Britannic Mayje sty* s Government).georet. WAR CABINET.79$9. Decontrol of Flour Mills and Wheat Trices.Memorandum hy the Parliamentary Secretary of the Board ofAgriculture and Fisheries.The Cabinet decided (W.C. 582.Min.4) that the Flour Mills shall be decontrolled from the beginning of next year and that imported wheat shall be sold to them by the Wheat Commission on the basis of 60/- for No. 1 Northern Manitoba.   It was proposed to allow English-Wheat to come down to a price in parity with No. 1 Northern Manitoba at 60/-, i.e. to about 55/-, leaving the farmer to recover the balance up to the Government&apos;s guarantee of 71/lld., under the operation of the Corn Production Act, as modified by legislation that has not as yet been introduced.   This procedure would not only arouse the utmost resentment and discontent among farmers but will introduce many other administrative difficulties in enforcing upon farmers the sale of their wheat when all other fee ding-stuffs, including hay, would be at a higher price.It is now proposed that the Wheat Commission shall give such a rebate to millers purchasing home-grown wheat as will enable them to pay prices which will on the average Just cover the Government guarantee.   As the millers remain; under control until the end of the year it will be possible to so adjust the rebate in the light of the ascertained Gazette price as to bring out the Gazette price up to the end of March almost exactly to 7l/lld. and thus carry out literally the Cabinet promise of November 19th.   This method will probably effect some saving to the Treasury in that the payment of the rebate to the millers on the wheat they buy will be less than the payment of I the differences to farmers under the Corn Production Act, because the amount of wheat bought by millers is expected to be less this season than a general average of 4 qrs. per acre on the whole area under wheat.   It will thus obviate any necessity for legislation;   the I promise of the Government will thus be carried out as regards wheat, I while as regards oats and barley the Wheat Commission are satisfied that the prices prevailing during the next seven months will be above the guarantee.The Board of Agriculture.are instructing their local officers to pay special attention to the returns of sales upon whioh the Gazette prices are based.The Food Controller and the Chancellor of the Exchequer have agreed to this procedure iARTHUR G. BOSCAWEN.12/8/1919.
