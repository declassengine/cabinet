G.T, 7945&apos;    O ^&quot;&apos;  - :&apos;:^&apos; .      t/MLFrom Viceroy, .7 th August        ,(Received 8th.) &quot;&apos;    Clear the line/     -       v 1 !     v &apos;- &apos; H426.T.S.  Secret.&apos;  Afghanistan.   Following from Grantv. &quot;This morning Maffey called on Afghan .delegates and explained to them, with maps, general lines1 on which it was proposed to&quot;demarcate the frontier in vicinity of the Khyber,&apos;and insisted that the demarcation line from Kabul&apos;River to Jaiki &quot;Pass was necessary. &quot;&quot;    .&apos; \, &apos;; &apos;( &apos;AV 4&apos;this afternoon Afghan, delegates attended meeting here, I begun by emphasising the necessity of at once settling whether it&apos;was to be.peace or war in view of the general situation on the &quot;frontier..1 Ali Ahmail agreed, and asked if Ivvas prepared to give him a letter regarding freedom of&apos; their foreign relations.&apos; He said, &apos; we lay greatest stress.on this.&apos; I said that I was prepared to/give him a letter, and handed&apos;him my draft in Persian, omitting last paragraph which [ propose&apos;to &quot;embody in a letter, as what hie requires is a letter which can be &quot;published at Kabul to &quot;Save his face. There is. no doubt Afghans are absolutely determined hot to accept a treaty which curtails their old sovereign rights in this matter,. arid further arguments would be useless. I took the opportunity, however,&apos;of again pointing out&apos; that&quot;the: way!in which the Amir conducted his foreign /relations would be important test of the friendliness of his attitude; and that, any subsidy hereafter granted would&apos;depend,&apos;in great measure, on extent to which he sought and followed our advice.      ; &apos; -&apos;&quot;&quot;;&quot;&apos; &apos;&quot;Ali Ahmad, who had shown sign of considerable heat, then&apos; spoke with great bitterness to the following effect:- , *&apos; &apos;&apos;      &quot;&quot; &apos; I came to conclude alliance of&apos; friendship with-the&apos;&quot;British-^ Governmentthat, you tell me, is now impossible.. Whatever representations I&apos;make you say &quot;you have no. authority to accept them,&apos; and forbid me to make representations lo; the Viceroy. You give me nothing&apos; satisfactory to take back.to. my Government&apos;.&apos; There is:nb :gi&apos;ve and take&apos; in your treaty. I do not want a letter-like statement you hate&apos;-given ine. You. seem to have some ulterior object. It would be better to -include/ your&apos;-assurance in the treaty itself, as I have suggested. If I cannot report &quot;anything &quot;satisfactory to my Government 1 shall be forced to join war party. We look&apos;-to you to&apos;give us schools, telegraphs and engineers5 to defend our frontiers, and you do nothing. Will you amend treaty as I wish ? &apos;J&apos;T said that we had no ulterior object and that it was impossible to put the assurance into the treaty as it would be out of place there. The war had cancelled all previous treaties and there was no point in saying in the treaty that the arrange-ment regarding foreign relations was also cancelled. My letter did all that was required. If they wished to break off negotiations they should do it now as we could not go on talking for ever. Ali Ahmad was a little. sobered by this and said he would like to think matters over.&quot; I then asked him what else he had got to say. He then protest&quot; 1 against demarcation of the whole border from Palosi to Sassobi as unnecessary. He said if he agreed to this his people would suspect him of giving away territory. I said for (corrupt group) reasons it was essential that we should demarcate the whole of this line which had been fruitful source of trouble and misunderstanding in the past. He begged that I would agree to- demarcation of few miles of it only. I said that the whole line must be demarcated and gave him further reasons. He said he would think it over.&quot; Next he objected to words in Article II. &apos;in view of the Avantori and unpro-provoked aggression of the Amir&apos; as derogatory. I have reason to believepHiey fear that if these words, are retained the Amir might be held liable to trial in the same way as the Kaiser. After some discussion I agreed to substitute the words &apos; in view of the circumstances which gave rise to this war.&apos; This seems harmless concession as we retain &apos; to mark their displeasure &apos; which are keynote of the Article.&quot;He again asked if the word &apos;contrite&apos; might be omitted from Article IV. I agreed.&quot; He then raised objections to the acceptance of the existing frontier in Article V. and suggested that this should, be for six months only. I explained that this was unnecessary amendment, and afte,v some heated discussion Afghans agreed to accept the words as they stand.
&quot;Ali Ahmad then again asked for amnesty for our tribes. I gave him same answer as before : that we should deal with our own tribes at our own time in our own way and that we could not admit right of Afghanistan to interfere in any way in this matter. Ali Ahmad said that he was (?) me friendly advice and dropped subject.&quot; He then called attention to the fact that in treaty Amir Amanulla Khan Avas not given title : Mis Majesty,&apos; and said this would give great olence. I pointed out that this was matter that lay in hand of His Majesty the King-Emperor,,who certainly could not be approached on the subject in present. circumstances. I dilated on impossible character of proposal at present, but said that if later Amir secured confidence and friendship of British Government it was possible that King-Empqror might be ( ? ) accord his recognition. Ali Ahmad accepted this, but suggested that &apos; Afghan (government&apos; should be substituted throughout in treaty for &apos; Amir Arnanulla.&apos;   After some discussion J: agreed to this..&quot;I then said that, only two questions remained at issue between us, namely, questions of demarcation of line from Kabul River to Tsatsobi Pass, and wording of my letter regarding their foreign relations. Ali Ahmad said he would think over these and give me. his answer to-morrow, and that if we,could then come to an agreement we should have meeting, on 8th August to sign treaty.&quot; After meeting was dissolved, Afghans had tea with us, and we had. good deal of frank and successfully carried-out conversation. .&quot; Jit. is obvious that Ali Ahmad is up against hostile elements, both amongst obstinate colleagues here andin Kabul. He is sincerely anxious to make peace, and means, I think, to play straight by us afterwards. But he has to save his own face, and it is.for this reason that 1 have given way over minor points in treaty specified above (two corrupt groups) agree some letter regarding, foreign relations which- I shall eventually give: him. Ali Ahmad assured me that if we would only give Afghanistan an assurance that she hud full liberty in her foreign relations she would very soon come back to us in practice, and that, we should be her advisers in a more real sense than ever before. We cannot, of course, build too much on this, but knowing that money-hunger must follow this war, I think there is hope that we shall obtain substance where we had: the shadow before.&quot;I asked Ali Ahmad if all delegates on his side would sign treaty. He said no ; it would: be sufficient if he and I alone signed. I agreed, to this, as it was obvious that Ali&apos; Ahmad was afraid that some of his party might make difficulties about signing.&quot;
