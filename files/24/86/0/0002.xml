A(SL3  BSSSig I!i THB H^LRTY Off HIS BRITAHHIO MAJDoT^S GOVERlttiM?. )secret.-war cabin l. t.LAID - SETTLEJCTT   (SCOTLAND)   BILL.Memorandum ,by the Secretary far Scotland.,I circulate herewith, for the consideration of the Cabinet, a draft of a Bill relating to land settlement in Scotland,The Bill is divided into five parts - Part I provisions as to the acquisition of land.    Part II amend-meat of the Small Landholders (Scotland) *ct, .1911..&apos; . Part III allotments.     Part IV financial, and Part V general.Tho sohome of tho Bill neoessarily differs from that of the English Bill beoause of tho difference in the existing methods of providing small holding in. the two countries.     In England acquisition has been by way of purchase or hire by.bounty councils, who sell or let the. land direct to small holders.     In ocotland.. under the small Landholders (Scotland) Aot, 1911, the normal mode of providing holdings ha3 been by way of extension of tho old croftor tenure, and tio land has not been acquired by the State or by   a county council at all.     The method adopted has been to select land, equip it, and require it to be let, where agreement has not been possible, by the landlord direct to tho land-holder on a system which confers fixity of tenure at a fair rent determined by tho Scottish Land Court. The cost of equipment and compensation has been paid out of the Agriculture (Scotland) IPtma, amounting to  200,000 a year, and its accumulations.    But it is to bo noterd that only  10,000 a year was voted during the continuance of the war.In accordance with the decisions of the Land Settlement Committee, as approved by the V,ar Cabinetthere will now be superimposed upon the existing system a purchase system.    Under the existing lav; (Congested Districts (Scotland) Act, 1897), there is a voluntary power of purchase in tho crofting counties, administered by the Scottish Board of Agriculture.     This&quot;power has, until the current yoar, been in disuetude since 1911, but an additional povrer to purchase for experimental purposes was conferred by the Small Holding Colonies Acts 1916 and ( 1918.     In view of the new proposals it has beenvC*       necessary to incorporate in Part I provisions which wero not necessary in the English Sill because the Small Holdings Act fif 1908 already provides in England a oode of compulsory acquisition by way of purchase.     In Scotland no such code exists.     The method adopted, after careful consideration, as calling for least   interforence with existing legislation, has been to repeal the references in the Colofties Acts tu the procedure under the jo Acts as experimental, and to develop that  rooe&amp;uro into a oomplete purchase code.    This is dons in clauses 1 and 3, and underthe
the First Schedule to the Bill.    By the time these xclauses are passed into law tho Acquisition of land Bill will presumably have been placed on the statute Boole, and it may be necessary to adjust the clauses to tho provisions of that measure.    The new purchase&apos; powers will expire along with tho Colonies .^cts at the end of two years from the passing of the new Act, and during that period the Scottish share of the twenty millions which have been allocated by the Cabinet to the   special purpose of small holdings will be available in accordance with the pro-visions of Part IV.It is not proposed, however, to limit tho Bill to purchase,    A strong feeling exists in Scotland and among my Scottish colleagues that the landholders Act of 1911 should be developed so as to cheapen and accelerato its procedure and to free it from certain conditions which have haapered its operation in the past and made it so expensive as to render its wide application almost prohibitive.    I gave pledges on this subject when Mr. Hogge&apos;s Bill amending tho Act of 1911 received a Second reading some time ago, and Part II is to be regarded as tho fulfilment of those pledges.Under the code of 1911 the interference of the Scottish Land Court was required ae a stage in the formation of now holdings, their oonsent being necessary to the application of compulsion.    The result was great delay and where the Land Court happened to differ from the Board of Agriculture for ueotland as to the rent which should bocharged, dislocation of the Board&apos;s estimates of the expense of a scheme. It seems unreasonable that tho body which on behalf of the State is foaming new holdings should not be entitled to fix the original rent to be charged for tho holdings, of whioh it uust be the beat judge, in agreement with the person to bo placed upon the holding, whom it selects.     !?he 31^3 accordingly shortens the procedure at this stage by eliiamating the Land CUurt and conferring full power upon the Board of Agriculture except in the matter of compensation^As to compensation, the provisions incorporated ill,tho 1911 Act were the result of discussions which had boon going on in and out of Parliament for five years.     It is now aciuraTtf; edged on all hands that the compensation provisions of that Act require further^adjustment and modification and the provisions contained in clause 9(11) pa^e 5 of the draft bill, are an attempt to substitute a more reasonable code.par? hi.TV is part of the Bill modifies the existing law as to allotments, whioh have been insufficiently developed in Scotland, by transferring powers from county councils to parish councils, and conferring further powers on the Board of agriculture and on the local authorities concerned.

i iClause 31 of the Bill provides for the isaue by the Treasury of Bums not exceeding  2,750,000 to the Public Forks loan Commissionsre4 who- are. empowered, to lend money to the Board of Agriculture for. Scotland for the acquisition and adaptation of land for the purposes of Part I, and for the adaptation of land for landholders under the Small Landholders (Scotland) Act, 1911.    Under the Scottish conditions there is no need for such an adjustment between the State and County Councils as haa &quot;been necessary in the English Bill,    Holdings in Scotland will he provided oat GBlaadacipfiredby one State without the intervention of a local authority, so far as they are provided at the expense of the State..  holdings  provided under the Small Landholders Act, again, are equipped at the expense of the State and not at that of any local authority..   The clause, how-ever, (which has &quot;been provisionally, adjusted with the Treasury) requires the Board to submit an annual statement showing losses incurred.    The proceedings cannot, of course, be carried out on an economic basis during *the next few years, and it is therefore. Drovided that the losses,, which will be shown in the annual estimates, to the extent approved by the Treasury, shall be paid out of moneys provided by Parliament.    In this way it will be possible to institute some comparison between the scale of expenditure and the amount of loss, incurred in Scotland with the results obtained under a different system in England,,,PART V.This, Part of. the Bill contains various   -miscellaneous provisions some of which are also contained in. the English Bill,(Sgd.)
