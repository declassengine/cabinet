This Document is the Property of His Britannic iViaie3ty&apos;s Government11 August.jm ^aSp - MYaL STTUATIOM ffffl mm TP MISSI&amp;.S%*lJrhallA^kr . A.        , -It       .v;^Ktne present time naval forces are co-operating with the various anti-Bolshevik forces in the following waters :&apos;a) Caspian ,b) Black Sea &apos;to) V/hite Sea ,d) Baltic.2. It is the declared policy of the Government to with-draw all the military forces in Russia, by the end of the present campaigning season, leaving only some of the military missions attached to the various Commands.   It is necessary, therefore, to view the situation as far as the Navy is concerned with regard to these theatres of operations.3. If it is decided to withdraw all naval support, itmust be fully realised that it would be very improbable that an opportunity would ever occur for making a fresh start.4. Caspian Sea,.    Orders have been issued for the BritishCaspian Squadron to be turned over to Denekin before the 15th August, and for the cfsws to be evacuated before the troops leave Baku.    It has already been pointed out that this course will probably lead to Denekin employing these vessels against the Azerbaijan Republic at Baku, as soon as he can get them manned, as he cannot maintain the Squadron in an efiicient condition without the resources of Baku and he must control Baku in order to prevent supplies of fuel being sent to his enemies.   There is, moreover, the risk of the vessels themselves coming under the Bolshevik influence.Black Sea.    It is presumed that our Naval forces will continue to make use of the Black Sea, as long as our troops remain in Turkey, and as long as we are supplying Denekin with military stores through Novorossisk, or other Black Sea ports.ite Sea.   It was decided at the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, 29th July, that all forces should be withdrawn in the ensuing months,     The monitor &quot;Erebus&quot; is proceeding to Kern to assist in the evacuation of this area.Baltic.,   ffhatever the military situation in this area may be at the close of the year, it will be necessary to with-draw all the naval forces operating in the eastern end of the Baltic before the ice forms, probably in December.The main reason for the presence of our naval forces in the Baltic Sea is the existence of Bolshevik naval craft, which would otherwise be at liberty to carry out operations on the shores of the Baltic.The naval situation has been improved in this area by the permission given to attack the Bolshevik naval forces, instead&quot; of the former defensive attitude.It will not be possible to guarantee that the Bolshevik forces will be locked up in&apos;the Gulf of Finland forthe
the winter, even after the ice forms as. the condition of the ice is. very uncertain, and the Bolsheviks have got ice*-breaking vessels.    In the event of a decision for.the naval forces to evacuate the Eastern end of the Baltic by a definite date, it is presumed that ships will be required at Libau so long as the military missions remain in the Baltic States.5.      -   At the Cabinet Meeting on Tuesday, .29th July, it was decided that support.would Be continued to Denekin as before.  No decision was reached with regard to the future policy an the Baltic, and this decision is now asked for. Hitherto the whole Allied policy in respect of Russia has been executed, as far as tne naval measures are concerned, almost entirely, by ourselves.    In view of the tremendous pressure for Reduction of the Navy Estimates now being brought to bear, the Admiralty consider that a resolute effort should be made to get the Allied Nations, and ultimately the League of Nationsr to undertake the responsibility for &quot;the measures necessary to carry out any definite Russian policy of which they may apnrove.(Sd.)
