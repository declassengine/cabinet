I have much pleasure in bringing to thenotice of my Colleagues the attached translation of extracts from an article which recently appeared in the Russian Newspaper &quot;Ohernomorski Mayak&quot;.Is it desirable that this should bepublished?-   (Sd.) W.H. lchb.13.8.19.
Translation from the nChernoraorski Mayak&quot;......    Kr) united* i&apos;J kiFIRST AfD AMBULANCE.The late war has brought nations to the last extremities of fatigneo    The craving for repose, the desire to limit oneself to the narrow bounds of personal comfort has become at the present almost part of tho political programme of every country that has played any part in the war-.In the background of this general egoism, that is so excusable and so natural, stands out England in her role of First Aid Ambulance of world wide altrucsm.From every quarter of Europe England is flooded with requests for military aid in the liquidation of Bolshevism and anarchy begotten by the waraChe might almost suppose that the famous proverb -&quot;Chacun pour soi et Dieu pour tous&apos;1 - had become, in the minds of the peoplos of Europe - &quot;Chacun pour soi et l1Angleterre. pour tous&quot; IEngland has fought no less than other nations, and has offered as full a sacrifice on the altar of war.She too is wearied to death after many years of heavy and cruel warfare.But the general task has bound her with her Allies with bonds of friendship, and the Englishman never betrays his friendship nor never withdraws the hand of aid when once offered,English friendship and help have a special meaning for us, who have lost our country, and are fighting for the rebirth of our homesoBritish troops are fighting together with ours.   The English have clothed our officers and soldiers; they are feeding the population of the Russian districts, which are freed from the Bolshevik yoke.But this is material aid.       Tho rich and generous friend magnanimously shares his riches with the poor.
English friendship gives us somothing more.   It is a spring of extraordinary moral value.   Wo are at present on tho threshold of the rebirth of Russia.  Tho country demands from us what was given neither by the old regime nor by the revolution - true citizenship and liberty.In the words of Montesquieu, the aim of the British Constitution is the protection of civil liberty; Liberty is the tranquility of the mind of the citizen, firm in the know-ledge that he is protected by the Laws.x x x x&apos; Tho victorious advance of the armies of General Lenikin continues under the banner of right and liberty.It is not only artillery, tanks and ammunition that the English have brought us.    Together with all this we have fallen under the influence of the English iron will and irresist-iblo tenacity in any task we undertake.   It is truly said that an Englishman would die rather than allow tho ball to be beaten out of his hands.We have fallen, too, under the influence of their citizenship and wonderful national organisation.    All nations who have by force of circumstances been connected with England have fallen under her beneficial influence.The most remarkable tenets of European and American constitutions are merely a reflection of the national ideas of equity that have lived for ages in the mind of the Englishman.If, as Karamzin has told us, &quot;the spirit of free thought and mutiny&quot; was acquired by the Russians from the Jacobins and advocates who brought about the revolution in Prance, so, too, perhaps the future historian will show us that it is from our friends the English that we have acquired respect for citizenship and love for law and order.The English Red Cross Ambulance has brought uo, not only a doctor and a nurse, but also a teacher.
