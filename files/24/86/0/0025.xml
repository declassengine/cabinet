WAR    CABINET,.THB FUTURE OF THE COAL ISDUSTRT.Memorandum &quot;by the President of the Board ofEducation,(The Memorandum is concurred in &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade and is circulated as an amended draft of G.T.-7924 in accordance with War Cabinet 611-A, Minute 1).The Government-accept- the policy of State Purchase of Mineral Rights in Coal on which all the reports of the coal commission (Second Stage) are unanimous.    As part of the.............Scheme for the purchase of these rights a levy will be made upon the compensation to be paid in England and Wales which will at least equal the reduction from compensation which would other-wise have been paid in Scotland had the system of Rate Levy on receipts of mineral values not existed in that Country. /The Government have been deeply impressed by the evidence which has been tendered to the Commission With respect to tho unsatisfactory social conditions under which the miners are compelled to carry on their industry in some parts of the Couutiy and the deduction, to which allusion hes been made, will go to form a fund which will enable theso.defects to be repaired on a comprehensive plan.The Government, after careful examination of all the Reports of the Coal Commission and the evidence given before it, have come to the conclusion that they would not be justified in under-taking the otate Purchase and State Management of Collieries;   and apart from any question of the desirability or otherwise of the nationalisation of the Coal Mines, the financial burden on the Country, having regard to other essential obligations on the State, is in itself such as to preclude its adoption,Among the conditions of any satisfactory organisation of tie Coal Industry in this Country, the Government hold:-(1)   That a reasonable standard of living should be secured to the miners and their families, that the deplorable housing conditions now prevailing in some of the Coalfields of the Country should be remedied without delay, and that every effort should be made to improve the comfort and amenities of the Industry.(2)   That&apos; in view of the fact that the lives and livelihood of the miners depend on the way in which the mines are worked, means should be devised for securing their co-operation in the shaping.of the general conditions of the Industry with-. out interfering with the executive control of individual minesM
i V\ Q I 6 0(3) That the Industry should be so organised asto reduce to a minimum the expenses of management and work-ing charges and that with this end in view the Country should be divided into convenient areas in each of -which an amal-gamation of neighbouring mines should be undertaken within a limited period.(4) That all the workers in and about the mines should have a direct voice in the Body controlling the policy of the Area Group to which they belong, and the status of each representative of the workers on this Body should be in all respects equal to that of the other members,(5) That the Government should be empowered to vetoor modify any scheme of amalgamation which is detrimental to the public interest, as also to protect the general bodyof consumers from possible exploitation by the Coal Industry. -(6) That the Industry, both on its industrial and itseducational side, should be so organised as to offer a free career to talent and to give to e^ory member concerned in it, in whatever grade of employment,. opportunities of improv-ing his&apos;abilities and his position.(7) That any scheme of&apos; re-organisation would bedefective which failed to fumiih coal in such quantities and at such a cost as to enable the export.trade of the Country to be maintained and extended.The Government propose to prepare a scheme on the above lines at once and will submit it to Parliament with the least possible -delay.In accordance with the unanimous recommendation of the Coal Commission a Committee will immediately be set up to inquire into the diminution of output in the Coal nines.2, V/hitehall Gardens, S.\7, 13th August, 1919
