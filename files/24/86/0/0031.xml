SECRET.G.T. 7929lit **91m8WAR CABINET.IMPERIAL. CABLE COMJTJNI.CATIONS iCopy, of lettcr from Sir Georre. Riddel 1 to the, &quot;    PrimeTCinlster, dated&quot;&quot; 1st. August,&quot; 19191 ij QMy dear Prime Minister,8, Bouve :!e Street, Fleet Street,,London, E.0.4. 1st August, 1919.The newspapers are much concerned regarding cable delays which most prejudicially affect the   Press in all parts of the Empire.thePuring the war/delays were serious and peace$- has brought no redress; on the contrary in some cases the delays are worse than they were before the war.So far as we.can gather, they are due to two causes (l) the increased use by Government Departments of the cable services, and (.2L$he deterioration of the cables owing to deficient repalije^athd maintenance.I am askeMl io communicate with you irt. reference to cause No,l.   The newspapers think it most essential that an instruc-tion should be issued to all Government Departments calling upon them to be more economical in their use of tho cables.   Until quite recently the War Office were cabling the Christian, surnames and regimental numbers of officers and privates demobilis-ecj in various parts of the world.   These messages ran into many pages.     I believe that the Australian Government are still adovb-ing the same practice, but we have already made1 strong represent)-tions to the war Office on the subject.   We are told that fc*fore the war the Government Departments were in the habit of cabling about 3*000 words per day, whereas they how Cable some 50*000 *Trade and commerce are suffering in consequence, and the newspapers being the chief private users of the services are the principal victims.A Committee, of which Lord Hilner is the Chairman, has been set up to consider the method of improving communication,.-.-throughout the Empire and the newspapers are about to lay their suggestions before it.   IShat is urgently required, however, is immediate relief, which can only be secured by the exercise of greater economy by Government Departments.I am writing on behalf of the Newspaper Conference, the Empire Press Union, and the Weekly Newspaper &amp; Periodical Proprietors Association, which comprise practically the whole of the newspapers, periodicals and magazines in the Empire.   There is a verjr strong feeling on the subject amongst all sections of the Press and it is thought that you may consider it desirable to nominate some person, or persons, who will make an immediate investigation, with a view to discovering exactly where the-&apos; &apos; responsibility lies and how reforms can at once be instituted.Very faithiully yours,(Signed)   GEORGE A. RIDHELLl^he Rt. Hon.D. Lloyd George, M.P., Whitehall, S.W.I.
