Farm in that neighbourhoodsThe weekly reports received from the Directors show that work is going on satisfactorily at all the Settlements. The corn at Patrjngten is beginning to turn, but harvest will not commence&quot;for&quot;&quot;another two wet-ks.     The set of Steam Tackle at this Settlement culti7ated ,318 acres during the week,     A Sleeping Van for use with this Tackle has now been purchased. The newly appointed Assistant Director of this Settlement takes up his duties during the present weok.At Hoibeach all the settlers are busy on their holdings as well as helping To pull the flax crop on the Central Farm. The corn crops are ripening fast,     The threshing of tho 1918 crops has now been completed, and the results are as followswfheat 1,224 quarters (4.6 quarters per acre) Oat3      740     &quot; (6 quarters      &quot;     &quot;   )Barley   372    &quot; (4.6 quarters   &quot;     &quot;   )The harvesting of peas and rye is proceeding at the Heath Hill Settlement.     All the settlers and probationers paid a visit during the week to the Harper Adams Agricultural College,
Great interest was shown in the &quot;soiling&quot; experiments and tho poultry sections.It is hoped to complete the hay harvest at Pembrqy during the present week.    The erection of the Huts Is&quot;nearly completed and the equipment, is arriving.    Pino harvest weather has &quot;been experienced at Ames &quot;bury  and considerable progress has been made with carrying oats and binding wheat.     All the com is now ripening fast.    614 lambs from this Settlement have been sold during the week at an average price of 40/9d, which is about 3/-more per head than the corresponding sale from this farm last year. An Assistant Director commenced duty at this Settlement during the week.   At Rolleston hay-making has not yet been completed, but a start has been made with harvesting winter oats.    The fruit crop a* Bosbury is being sold during the present week.(ii)   Work of Agricultural jbcecntive Committees.Glebe Lands Act, 1888*   Six applications for tho Board&apos;s approval of sales under this Act were received last week, the acreage of land included in suoh applications being 228 acres. During the same period 12 sales were approved relating to an area of 7 07 acres.Bntry on Lands.    Tho Somerset A.E.C, have been authorised to take possession of a 0 acre field at Lovington in order to enable the incoming tenant to prepare the land for a wheat crop. The field is full of couch and unless its cultivation is undertaken at once it cannot bo cropped for another year.    The Board will be put to no expense in the matter.The Kent A.E.C. called the attention of the Board to a the large acreage of arable land in that County that is rapidly becoming derelict, and asked for a statement of the Board;s views as to what may be done to prevent a great deal of the good work that has been carried out in the past two years from being lost.A reply has been sent to the Conmitteo pointing out that prices have been guaranteed for the corn crop of this year which, in the opinion of the Board, are adequate to meet the co3t of cultivation.    The Board have also invited the Committee&apos;1 s attention to the speech made by the Prime Minister on July 29th which may be taken as a sufficient declaration of the intention of the Government to maintain remunerative prices for next season1 s crop.    With regard to future years, it has been pointed out to the Committee that no statement can be made as to tho extent or duration of guarantees until the Royal Commission now sitting has submitted its interim report, but the &quot;Board hare expressed the view that although under peace conditions farmers cannot be compelled to undertake aiy form of cultivation that will involve them in a pecuniary Iosb, the Agricultural Executive Committees will be justified in calling upon occupiers of land to maintain arable cultivation as consistent with good husbandry.
The decision as to whether particular areas of land ought, consistently with good husbandry, to be maintained under the plough or allowed to return to grass must be left to the practical experience and local knowledge of each Committee, but the Board consider that whenever a Committee decides that particular land is best managed under grass, the occupier should be expected to lay the land properly to grass and not allow it to tumble down, or to go derelict, and if necessary the Committee should serve a cultivation notice in order to prevent this,J^iP^^?.?lL5lJ?UV0Al.%MM^    On the 18th of July Lord Glenconner&quot;wre t e to the President, stating that he farms about 1,300 acres of poor chalk land on Salisbury Plain, and that he has received letters from the Wiltshire A.JS,C. containing complaints regarding its cultivation, and threatening to take possession of the land.     Lord Glenconner asked if the Board were anxious to occupy and work hi3 land, and pointed out that farming at present is very difficult, owing to the season and the local labour conditions,     The matter was investigated by the Board&apos;s District Commissioner, who reported that the land in question had been under observation by the Executive Committee since 1917, but that instead of improving had grown steadily worse.     The Wiltshire Executive Officer met the Agent and Bailiff on the farm last April, and it was then agreed to put more horseB on the farm, but on a further inspection made in July it was found that 39 acres of land had gone out of cultivation altogether, and that much of the remainder of the land was full of couch and rubbish, and apparently no effort was being made to clean it.In a reply to Lord Glenconner the Parliamentary Secretary stated that the difficulties under which all occupiers of land have been carrying on for the last few years owing to the acute shortage of labour are fully recognised, but substantial provision was made whereby the Executive Committees were enabled to afford assistance, not only with regard to labour, but also with horses,, tractors and implements.     Lord Glenconner was also informed that the Committee were not anxious to take over the land, but that they feel that if an owner in Lord Glenconnei^s position is allowed to hold land in such a condition as that on Salisbury Plain without any interference on their part, their authority in dealing with other occupiers would be undermined.     The Parliamentary Secretary stated that he felt compelled to support the action of the Committee, and he expressed the hope that lord Glenconner would be able to make some arrangement whereby it would be possible to meet the views of the Committee.,(iii)   Tithe, Commons,jCopyholdand Survey.The.following comparative statement of applications for redemption of tithe rentcharge during the past week and the corresponding week in previous years is of interest as showing the extent to which the redemption work of the Branch is increasing:-

The Railway Executive Committee have now issuad instructions with a view to securing prompt delivery of this class of traffic, and it is hoped that this may do something to obviate the present difficulties which arise from farmers having postponed their orders for Binder Twine to the very last moment, notwithstanding&apos; the frequent notices which have been issued by the Board urging them to secure delivery early in the season.A number of complaints have also been received in regard to the return of empty fruit baskets.     The delays appear to have been partly due to the recent strikes on the North Eastern Railway and at Liverpool and also to the shortage of railway cartage in London.Inspection ,,of Immune Varieties of Potatoes.

Warners King,The question of increasing the supply of Apple Stocks was considered, and the suggestion put forward that Cider manufacturers should &quot;be urged to save seed from their cider pomace in order to make good part of the shortage was agreed to be very desirable.     It was arranged that the Agricultural and Horticultural Research Station, Long Ashton, should ascertain a cheap method of separating the pips from the pomace, and that arrangements should be made to place this before the Cider manufacturers,A Conference was held on August 1st to discuss Sil \er Leaf Disease of fruit trees, at which Professors Blackman and Barker and Messrs P.T, Brooks and Brierley attended.   After discussing the practical points which require investigation and surveying the work which has already boon done, it was decided to ask Professor Blackraan and Mr, Brooks to draw up a comprehensive scheme of investigation for discussion by the Conference at a later date.Organisation.Somerset,    The County 00uncil have procured a farm at Carmington which is to be used as a Parm Institute,    Possession is expected to take place about Se september 1920.     The suggestion has been made that the syllabus of the Winter Classes in agriculture might include horticulture, especially of the type most suitable for farmers, e,g* farm orchards and their management, vegetable growing, etc.    The subject of osier growing in the country is to receive the attention of the Horticultural Instructor,Devon^    No scheme for training ex-service men in Horticulture has been formal ate J., but the Secretary for Education states that he will allow the Horticultural Instructor to give instruction at aiy training centres should they be set up.      The Small Holdings Committee are settling ex-service men on the land, and have placed four officers for residential training .in market gardening, and arc corresponding with other growers to endeavour to obtain- further vacancies.    The Committee have in view tho
purchase of a large farm of 500 acres for a training centre.    A parcel of tho land would be givon over to , market gardoning should the soil prove to be suitablo.j^affs,     A Horticultural Sub-Committee is in process of formation and land and buildings have been secured at Rodbaston for use as a farm institutoe whore attention will bo given to horticulture,Organisation.Boyonv.   Mr. Pyne, of High Street, Topsham, has expressed his willingneijpto place his Victoria Plum plantation at the disposal of the Long Ashton Research Station for extensive experiment as to Silver Leaf,   out acceptance is dependent on whether it can be embraced in the general scheme of investigation which is to be drawn up by Professor &quot;Blackmail and Mr. Brooks. American Gooseberry Mildew has appeared amongst Mre Fyno 1 s plants and the staff at Long Ashton propose trying some experimental washes to combat the disease.Beo-ffeoping.Sugar for Autumn Trending.     County Authorities are now in reoeipt&apos;*&quot;of full particulars of the scheme-for allocating a supply of sugar to cover the period from now until 51st December, and it is hoped that the necessary registration forms and certificates will bo printed and issued within ten days,Italian Queens*     All tho Italian queens ordered have now been delivered and those which died on, or soon after, arrival have now been replaced.jgall Live Stock,The piggery of the Harrow Weald Co-operative pig Club was inspected during the week.     This Club has been very successful since it commenced.     It is run on modern lines with concrete pig houses and up-to-date drainage.    The pigs (5 breeding sows and 30 or 40 young stock) appear to be in excellent condition, and were at the time of inspection enjoying their freedom in a field 280 foot long and 80 foot wide, which is rented by tho Club.jlant Diseases Section.Wart Pisoase.t     Further outbreaks on main crop varieties are reported from the West and North Midland counties, occurring in allotments and gardens in districts previously comparatively free from the disease.I Qrops of immune Varieties of.Potatoes.      The value of anyvariety can never be truly determined, until&quot; the lifting of the crop has boon completed, so the following remarks can only apply to tho present position as seen by Inspectors.
First Parlies.     Snowdrop and Witch.Hill have again ^given great satisfaction., yielding sound early crops of nice shaped tubers of good quality suitable for table purposes. These varieties will certainly be grown on a large scale in allotments and gardens as soon as the supplies increase. Edzell Blue, always a great cropper, has fully proved its use as a good variety for small growers.     The few  argill Ilarlies planted in England have given quite satisfactory crops of high class tubers.     This potato is a real first early of the old-and. popular &quot;Hyatt1s Ashleaf&quot; type and will in future be planted on a large scale by early growers in Wart Disease Infected Districts.     ft is understood that the supplies of this variety will be fairly large this season.Second Parlies and,Main Crop.     The crops of King George, Great Scot and Arran Comrade have all grown well since the rain and promise to yield average crops.    Ally and Y-ajestic unfortunately have not given the same promise j for many planted sets have failed to grow and many blanks appear in the crops.    Many excellent crops of these varieties have been produced where seed-size sets were planted, so it appears probable that the large tubers of these varieties will hot boar cutting.    Kerr&apos;s Pink was distributed last season as grown, and the large tubers were undoubtedly cut into smaller sets before planting, but all are growing well and excellent crops have been noted in England and Wales,     Reports indicate that the crops of Kerr&apos;a Pink in Scotland are also locking well.     Tinwald Perfection (or Rob Roy) when first introduced did not crop at all well, but last year the yields were quite satisfactory.    This year the crops are looking remarkably well, and it will certainly be a popular farmers * potato in the Infected Areas,American Gooseberry Mildew.     In dealing with this disease during the past few years the experience of fruit growers pointed to the fact that Lime-Sulphur spray, applied ., in a suitable manner and at the proper time, would keep the bushes more or less free from disease, or, at any rate, prevent serious attacks.    An investigation has been carried out by inspectors with a view to obtaining information as to the value of this spray as an effective means of dealing with this disease.    A summary of their report shows that:-1.   The larger growers are in favour of action being taken by the Board to enforce spraying of bushes, a view,which is not shared by the small growers.    Both agree, however, that as the labour problem is so acute, spraying would be easier and cheaper and probably more effective than tipping.2.   Many growers raised an objection that Lime Sulphur checked growth, a point on which the Board have no reliable information.Black-leg of Potatoes..     Hassee in 1910 wrote that this disease has been known for some time on the Continent, but fortunately it is, as yet, rare in Great Britain, though there is reason, however, to fear that it is spreading in this country.     This forecast of Massee has proved to be true, for Inspectors report that the disease is quite common in crops of King George, Great Scot, Majestic and All:/., in all parts of England and Wales.     It may be tiiat th^se newer varieties are more susceptible to this disease than those previously grown, so that the parasite has increased at a more rapid rate.     In t
1917 the disease was noticed in Scotland to he fairly common in many of the crops of potatoes, and it is probable that the more extensive use of Scotch seed during the past few years has distributed the disease over a wide area.    The disease is very destructive in its habits and causes aerious losses in the potato crop.    The leaveBwilt and turn yellow, then shrivel and die, the disease starting low down on the stem, the uppermost leaves being the last to succumb.    When the leaves begin to droop, the aurface of the underground part of the stem bearing such leaves is more or less covered with brownish stains.    This discolouration gradually extends up the stem, which finally becomes quite b2,ack and soon decays.    Black patches also appear in the young tubers and  in a severe attack rotting of the tubers results.    Potato plants showing signs of this disease should be lifted and burnt.    Experience points to the fact that the disease is spread by planting infected &quot;sets&quot; and it is probable that the Board may find it necessary to take steps to control the spread of this disease which in the past has caused such serious losses in some other European Countries,Labour Division.Demobilization.     The number of men described as agriculturists demobilised during the seven days ended 6th August was 934, making the total demobilized to that date 243,268.Agricultural Occupations.    Reports from eleven Agricultural 2 xecutive Committees indicate that owing to light crops a shortage of labour for harvest is not anticipated. In some of these cases this will be bo only if the Prisoner labour is not- withdrawn.Twenty three other Committees regard the labour situation seriously in view of the shortage expected.    The other twenty eight Committees have so far not expressed any opinion./ h f$0f. f&quot;Skilled men are particularly asked for in all cases, and tigs grant of harvest, furlough is suggested as a measure most likely &quot;to *ease&apos;the position.Of the Committees which have reported, 14 give estimates of the men who will be required, viz. a total of 10,040, or an average of 717.    It is probable, therefore, that a total of 15,000 will be necessary even if the 25,00t) German Prisoners are still to be available.    As the returns of the Ministry of Labour show that only 1,394 men were registered up to 1st August at the iimployment Exchanges in England and Wales as requiring agricultural occupations, a supply of labour from Military sources will be essential if the crops flfcfc to be gathered.Womeriaoranph.The supply of and demand for woman labour remain about the same.    The Flax camps are in full swing, and all the women required have been supplied.The Women*s Agricultural Committee in Warwickshire passed a special vote of thanks to the forewomen and members of the Land Army who had worked With the Threshing tackle during the past season.    It was stated that the forewomen by their excellent and untiring work and the force of their
K:)example held their ganga together, often under difficult conditions and worked with them arid for theta in ftuch a way as to secure the greatest efficiency and happiness possible. Without the help of these forewomen the County Threshing Scheme could not have been carried through and the Committee wish to express to them their gratitude and appreciation.Prom xork comes a report that two farmers who are employing members of the Land Army during the harvest are disturbed by rumourB that the Land Army will shortly be demobilized, as they will find it quite impossible to continue farming without their women.    Besides the women these farmers require for harvest, they have permanent workers on the farms.An interesting record hae been made by a cowman now working in Dorset.    During the war he has held situations both in Somerset and Dorset and has trained over 100 girls for the Land Army in milking.    Ke is greatly interested in hie pupils and excellent reports have been obtained of their work from the farmers.The Cheshire Land Girls Savings Club is proving a great success.Women1&amp; Institutes.    A member of the Junior Branch of the Madron&apos; Women !s Institute, Cornwall, won the first prize at the Royal Cornwall Show atTruro, for scalded cream butter and waft highly commended for her cheese.The Norfolk County Federation of Women1s Institutes held a very successful Exhibition in connection with the Royal Norfolk Agricultural Show on July 18th and 19th.    24 Institutes were represented.Three new Institutes were started last week, making the total of 1,176.

BoEES^PiEilisifl..Tho number of agricultural schedules still outstanding is approximately 25..00c.   A rough preliminary estimate of the chiof acreages is In courso of preparation.The monthly report on tho condition of crops shows1 that on tho whole there has been improvement in barley and hops, and slight improvement in wheat, potatoes and peas, but beans and mangolds have further deteriorated,     The crops, although practically everywhere light; arc otherwise Quito healthy, and the potato crop and hops, in particular, seem unusually froe from diseaseTho quantity of wet fish landed in July was 745,000 cwts.   (an improvement on June), valued at  1,430,000, the average prico thus showing1, a reduction.With the reduction in the controlled pri go of fat stock, supplies of cattle ard sheep were, in accordance with anticipation, smaller during tho first week in August than a week earlier. Tho cattle entering markets were nevertheless above tho average for the same week in the 3 previous years, abut sheep were below this average.
. d a 6prlcultural Wages Board.   At leominster on the 8th August sn employer &apos;     was summons oTfor lEe underpayment of two workers.   In the case of the first the Bench ordered payment of  20 arrears and imposed a fine of  1 without costs.   In respect of the second worker the i     prosecution did not press for payment of arrears as the ease was one where a Permit of Exemption was being applied for and would probably be obtained.   In order to show that Permits must be applies for or the minimum wage paid a conviction and small penalty were asked for.   In this case also the Bench Imposed a fine of  1 without costs.An employer was summoned at Pooklington, Yorks., on 2nd August in respect of underpayment of two workers,   The Bench decided that the evidence was   insufficient and dismissed the cases.On the 9th August, an employer was summoned at lymington, Hants., for r^underpayment of 5 workers.   In the first three cases the Bench decided that there were contracts between employer and workers and that the employer did not know that-the contracts were illegal.   In these eagres a. conviction was registered with costs against the Defendant, but no penalties were imposed.   In each of the other two cases the Defendant was fined  25.   In all the cases the arrears due to the workers were ordered to be paid and these amount to between  160 and  170.A case was heard against an employer at ,Cranbrook, Kent, on 7th August, in respect of a worker who had been employed at lees than the minimum rate.   It was proved by the Defence that the employer had several times urged the worker to apply for a Permit of Exemption, but he had failed to do soc   It was a case where a Permit would doabtless have been granted if applied for.   The Bench decided that a technical offence had been committed, but under the circumstances did not see their way to register a conviction.   They added that farmers must not leave it to the worker to apply for a Permit of Exemption but must apply for it themselves.A case against an employer was heard at Wigmore, Hereford, on 5thAugust for underpayment of a worker.   A quantity of cider had been given to this man and was considered as part payment of wages.   The prosecution did not press for a substantial penalty in this case, and the Defendant was fined  1 and ordered to pay the arrears*   The Chairman when anaouneirg the result said &quot;it is well known it is illegal to tales cider into account in completing wages; cider is a percnusite, not a part of wages&quot;.During the week 53 cases of complaint of non-payment of the minimum rates were received, the largest number from a single county being five in the case of Essox, Herts, and Kent.   Eighty-one cases were sent to Inspectors for visit; 79 cases were completed. Reports were received from Inspectors in 89 cases.gm Workers1 Branch.Several cases of dispute with regard to harvest wages have been reported, and the Farmed&apos;&quot; Union and the labourers&apos; Unions have been communicatea with,   la Warwickshire and in Staffordshire disputes are still unsettle!, bub there has been very little, if any, aotual stoppage of wjrk.   Tr* threatened strike in Hertfordshire was averted, &quot;Both Mr0 Walker and Mr. Dallas 7*sre seen specially in connection with this case, as well as-Mr. Apps.   The difficulty was to some extent caused by the injudicious action of the Farmers1 I     Union in calling a meeting which the representatives of the Workers Union refused to&apos;attend.
