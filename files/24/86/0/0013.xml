(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF. HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.)S :-E C R E T.G.T. 791S.MAR CABINET.TERMINATION OP THE PRESENT WAR(DEFINITION) ACT, 1918.Memo: by&apos;the Fi^st Commissioner of Forks.In connection with the Declaration to be made by His Majesty in Council under the provisions of this Act, as to the date which is to be treated as the date of the termination of the present war, It appears that in so far as any latitude ig allowed to the Government in settling this date, the various Government Departments whose -fork is affected by the Act, may, owing to the different contractual obligations into whloh they have entered, have different wishes as to whether the date or dates declared in accordance with Section I (1) or I (3) be early or late.  .2.   It is presumed that before the date Is definitelyfixed this question will M^^AtoLtdJay.....the War ^Cabinet t an dthat it is within the power of the Government to defer fixing the date until the ratification of the last Treaty Is arranged. The considerations determining the Government&apos;s decision will, doubtless, be varied; and some may be of such outstarid.-ing importance as to override others, but in.so far as latitude is possible and the contractual obligations of this Department In regard to accommodation may be taken into account, the First Commissioner desires to emphasise the fact that the later the dates in question may be the greater will be the alleviation which will be afforded to this Department in overcoming the difficulties attendant on the solution of accommodation questions.     In addition to the fact that numerous tenants removed from requisitioned accommodation hold tenancies expiring several months after the termination of the war, a considerable number of th^ premises hired by this Department since the;outbreak of hostilities are held on agreements terminating shortly after the end of the war, and as the reduction in the numbers of official staffs is considerably less than the estimates (given formally and informally from time to time by the various Departments) upon vhich this Departments schemes have been based, the difficulties in the way of releasing important premises affected by the fixing of.this date ic dates are thereby accentuated.3.   The First Commissioner hopes that as far as possible effect may be given to these considerations.His Majestyxa Office of vorks, 5th August, 1919.(Signed) Alfred Mond.
