This document is the property of His Britannic Majestys GovernmentREPATRIATION OF GERMAN PRISONERS OF WAR.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR,By Article 214 of the Treaty of Peace the repatriation of German prisoners of war and interned civilians &quot; shall take place as soon as possible after the coming into force of the present Treaty and shall be carried out with the greatest rapidity.&quot; The machinery for effecting this will, by Article 215, be a Commission composed of representatives of the Allied and Associated Powers and of the German Government. The details will be worked out and and carried into effect by Sub-Commissions in each of the Allied and Associated countries on which the German Government will be represented. .A Convention for the appointment and regulation of the Commission and Sub-Commissions, of which a copy is attached, was drawn up by the Commission of Prisoners of War in June for consideration by the Supreme Council. Notwithstanding pressure exerted by the British representative this Convention has not yet been considered and there appears to be reluctance on the part of the French to allow of this being done, jj From a military point of view it is most desirable that the repatriation of prisoners[ of war and interned civilians shall be effected as speedily as possible from all parts of the Empire. Involving as it does a large amount of sea transport, the procedure must in any case be slow. The expense of maintenance of the prisoners is great and their guarding and administration call for the services of a considerable number of soldiers of all ranks. Winter is coming on and it will soon be necessary to provide covered I accommodation in this country for those who are now under canvas. A spirit of unrest I is widespread. Disturbances of a serious character have been threatened. If these cannot be suppressed by ordinary means it may be necessary to use force, which would be especially regrettable in the present circumstances. Neither officers nor men can, or will, understand why their repatriation is delayed 9 months after the Armistice. They are, as a whole, very neurotic.Of the 84.891 German combatant prisoners of war in this country only 34,680 are . employed, of whom 24,325 are engaged in agriculture.   The whole of the 196,609 Germans in France are engaged in salvage work.   Elsewhere the amount of work which is got out of them is almost negligible.Notwithstanding any inconvenience which may be caused by the withdrawal of their labour in this country and in France, I ask that the consent of the Supreme Council may be obtained to our taking independent action to repatriate all German pnsbners^ wherever in our charge, as soon as possible after the ratification of the Peace Treaty.It will be necessary to assemble sub-commissions on which the German Government should be represented, as they have to bear the whole cost and to provide the necessary transport to the limit of their capability. This procedure can be followed only by ignoring that portion of Article 215 of the Peace Treaty which deals with the formation of the Commission on which all the Allies are represented.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.13th August, 1919.(B19/371)  70  8/19  S&amp;S  7410wo
BEPORT OF THE COMMISSION OF PRISONERS OF WAR, ON THE COMMISSION AND SUB-COMMISSIONS FOR THE REPATRIATION OF PRISONERS OF WAR UNDER THE TREATIES OF PEACE.In order not to delay for a single moment the putting into execution of the Treaty of Peace in so far as it concerns the immediate repatriation of prisoners, the Commission on Prisoners of War has the honour to submit for the approval of the Conference the text of a Convention for the appointment and regulation of Commissions and sub-Commissions provided for in Article 215 of the Treaty of Peace with Germany and analogous Articles in the Treaties of Peace with other enemy Powers.In view of Article VI. of the Draft Convention, the Commission considers it to be its duty to point out the urgency of appointing the delegates of the Allied and Associated Powers, and of convoking these delegates without delay for the prompt consideration .of transport and other questions relating to repatriation of prisoners of .war.The Commission has not dealt with the problem of tike- Russian prisoners of war in this Convention, but is of opinion that this question should be sbrought to the notice of the Conference. It is not unmindful of the fact that the Inter-Allied Commission on Prisoners of War in Berlin is already dealing with the repatriation o.f Russian, prisoners of war from Germany.  Tone the less the Commission is of the opinion jtjhait it would not be inappropriate to consider whether it would not be as well to take into account the future representation of the Russian Government on the Commission, proposed in the draft ,.Conventtion accompanying this Report*lih June, 191-9.COMMISSION AND SUB-COMMISSIONS FOR THE REPATRIATION OFPRISONERS ,OF W4&amp;I.The Commission provided for in Article 2,15 ,yf the Treaty of Peace &quot;with ^Germany and the similar Articles of the Treaties ,0/ Peace with other enemy States sha^l hie authorized to arrange for the repatriation of all enemy prisoners.For the determination of questions relative to -the execution of the various Treaties of Peace it shall be composed ;cf ;-Ten delegates appointed respectively by the Governments of the United States, Great Britain, France, Italy and Japan, two for each Power.The delegates of any of these Powers shajjl not take part in the discussion .of matters which concern an Enemy Power with which their respective -Governments have not been at war.It shall include moreover :-(1.) ]?or questions relating to the execution of the Treaty of Peace with Germany-la.)
