From the returns&quot;1 received^y?tn*e Board it is**oTear that the Councils pf &quot;County Boroughs are not. making satisfactory progress in carrying out the Land Settlement Scheme either with regard to the acquisition of land or the interviewing of applicants for small holdings.      The Board have, therefore, addressed a circular letter to all County Boroughs impressing upon them $he importance of not allowing applicants to go without an answer for more than a few da,rs, and ur^in-? them to arrange for each applicant to be interviewed at the earliest possible date after the receipt of his application.
The Board have also urged the Councils of County Boroughs to consider at once what procedure they should adopt with.regard to land settlement.       The Board have pointed out that Councils can deal with their applicants in one of three ways, as. follows:-(l)   By the direct provision of small holdings by the Borough Councils themselves,(2)   By arranging with the Council of a neighbouring county to take over Borough applicants and deal with them on an equal footing with their own applicants.(3)   By advising every applicant for a small holding to apply to the Board to be accepted for one of the Board&apos;s Farm Settlements, PiJlPlil^ yJ^ ^rj.&apos;     During the week the Board received notice &quot;of tlii^follov/in&quot;^ Orders made by Countv Councils for the compulsorv purchase of land,C ountv.

9t)o t* (/ tjThe number of ex-Service men at the seven Farm Settlements of which the Board have already obtained possession is now 229, namely, 59 settlers, 125 probationers, and 44 other men employed as wago-carners.      An additional 22 men have been accepted as probationers, but have not yet started work.A scheme for the development of the Bosburv Farm Settlement has been prepared for submission to the Treasury during the week.      It is proposed to devote this Settlement to ex-Officers and to provide at&apos;the outset five small holdings suitable for mixed farming, 35 to 50 acres in extent.      The remainder of the land in hand, which is not suitable for division into small holdings, will bo farmed as 0113 unit on a profit-sharing basis.      Officers will be accepted at this Settlement as soon as the Army Huts arranged for have been erected by the Office of &apos;7orks.The reports received from the Directors show that at Pa trim ton the rather cold weather will make tho harvest a late one,      $early all the hav is now in stack and the bulk of it has been harvested in very good condition.      The set of steam tackle at this Settlement cultivated 214 acres during tho week.      At Ilolbeach the settlers are busv marketing their crops, such as new potatoes, beans, peas, and carrots. Owing to the dull weather the crops are ripening verv slowly. Harvest operations have commenced at Heath Kill, a start having been made with rye, winter oats, and blue peas.     The pure bred gilts recently purchased with the object of supplying young pigs to tho settlers have now all farrowed with very satisfactory results.     The Array Huts have now arrived at Pembrev^ and will be erected during the week.        Hearlv all the hay has now been gathered.      Additional sheep are being purchased for this Settlement, as there is plenty of feed. At Mejsburv winter oats are being harvested and the wbeat is nearly ready for cutting.      About 500 tons of hav have been obtained in good condition at this Settlement,     A commencement is beinp; made with the harvest at Rolleston, the winter oats being now read&quot; to cut.     Additional stock have been purchased for this Settlement and are doing well.(ii)   Tithe, Commons.

Materials and labour paid on schedule, also cartage as accounts fall due,   (Builder tender of over  1300 not accepted).Sulphate of Ammonia.   The prices to be charged for Sulphate of Ammonia during the 8 months of the current season from October to sHay next have been provisionally discussed with representatives of the Trade,    The Trade represented that owing to increases in wages and the price of coal they were unable to continue production except at prices which would show a substantial increase over those ruling last year.    The prices proposed, including delivery to farmers nearest station are  21.10s. for delivery in October rising gradually to  22 for delivery in Harch - May.    The corresponding figures last season wore  15,15s. to  16.15s. but the manufacturers at that time received a subsidy from the Government which brought the gross sum up to about  19,10s.     The direct increase which they receive this
year as compared with last year is therefore much less than it appears, and it cannot he said that the prices they ask are excessive having regard to the increase in the cost of production,Potash.   An arrangement has now &quot;been made &quot;by the Board of Trade whereby a Group representing British Potash interests have agreed to purclia.se such quantity of the German Potash acquired by the Govern-ment as may. arrive in this country up to the end of September next, This arrangement is subject to an agreement as to the price at which the material is to be sold to farmers and others.     The Group have also been given an option to buy   the whole of the material acquired by the Government from Germany,The importation of Alsatian Potash is jo be restricted to 20,000 tons of Potash Salts not exceeding 20$ k3   up to the 30th June 1920;   when the total available supplies have been absorbed by industry and agriculture, further licences will be granted,Transport of Pruit,,   In order to guard against the risk of waste of Fruit owing &quot;co*&quot;delays in transport, it has been arranged that the Ministry of I?ood should give instructions to their local Commissioners that road transport must, if possible, be provided for the con-veyance of fruit in cases of necessity,     The rate to be charged is under consideration.    This arrangement will, it is hoped, meet the demand made by Viscount Deerhurst for the speoial provision of transport for fruit in Worcestershire.The conditions at Covent Garden have recently been reported satisfactory;   salesmen are now co-operating with Railways with a view to remedying the complaints of congestion that have been made.Inspection and Certification of Crops of Immune Varieties of Potatoes.    On August 2nd 4383 acreB of potatoes had been registered by the Board for inspection, over 2000 acres being in Westmorland, Cumberland and Lancashire alone;   a very considerable area has been registered from Cambridge and Lincoln.     The rains have brought the potatoes on rapidly, and the crops are now ready for inspection.British Scientific Products Exhibit ion,,   The Commercial Division of the Board arranged for an exhibit to be staged at the Central Hall, Westminster demonstrating -(l) The effect of Wart Disease on the production of potatoes.(2) Immune Varieties of potatoes.(3) The Breeding of Seedling potatoes.This week dislies of exhibition tubers of first early varieties immune to wart disease - such as Snowdrop, Arran Rose, li^zell Blue, America, Witch Hill, Dargill Early, were staged.     The exhibit attracted much attention.    The King and Queen visited the Exhibition and were especially interested in the potato section. The King remarked that the exhibit had a good educative value, and should be visited by all scientists interested in Agriculture.

This survey is
1to be carried out partly by theJlortiouXtrural Instructors for the various counties, and partly by the Board1 s rnspactors, Messrs, Whiting and Turner, to ascertain the exact conditions of the orcharding in these counties with a view to laying down plans for the improvement of existing orchards and for the establishment of new orchards on up-to-date lines.During the week a Conference on County Organisation., was attended at Bury St. Edmund1 s, when Lord Bristol (Chairman, of the County Counoil), Mr. E. Hu3sler (Vice Chairman), and Mr, BillsLlarx? (Chairman of the Agricultural Education Committee), were present. It appears probable that a satisfactory Committee will now be formed, and a Horticultural Organiser appointed.Salop.   A new Committee to deal solely with Horticulture has been set up and has commenced to work.      Several members of the old Committee have been absorbed into the new Committee including the Chairman - Mrs. Fielding - who retains the same position on the new Committee.Wiltshire.    Major Fuller is proposing to set up a Fruit Demonstration Plot, the selected site being at Warminster,Yorkshire. Marked Gardening; at Cottingham, Hr, Hull. There is a very wide field for the dissemination of first rate advice and information in this district. The Growers have no Association, neither do they meet and discuss their work; the Board*s Leaflets and Pamphlets are unknown to them. They are unprogressive and do not understand the benefits which could be derived from co-operation.Small Live Stock Section.The case of a Poultry keeper in London being requested by his Landlord to remove his poultry and appliances has been investigated.    It was found that 32 hens and pullets were kept and that 3,000 eggs were produced last season, the mjority of which were sold to the neighbours.    It was stated that no complaints had been made, and as the stock appeared to be very healthy and clean, the matter was taken up with the Agents. Their views, and that also of the Landlord Is that the presence of poultry depreciates the property in value, and also encourages rats.    It is hoped that    the poultry keeper will be permitted to keep his stock until the end of March next year.Enquiries have been very numerous during the week, showing that the interest taken in poultry keeping and rearing is very great.    Advice has been asked for on all kinds of points connected with the industry,Plant Diseases Section.I Wart Disease,   this disease has now appeared on main cropvarieties,,    Outbreaks have been reported from Denbigh, Salop and Pembroke, occurring in land on v/hich the disease had not previously been known to exist.Proposed Wart Disease Order of 1919,   The Seed Potato Advisory Committee met in London on July 25th an$ agreed to the terms of the Wart Disease Order of 1919.    Under the proposed Order all Licence restrictions relating to the planting, and the sale for
planting, of certified approved immune varieties, will be removed, but other potatoes for planting can only be moved into an infected area under the provisions of a Licence,Potato,Blight,     Outbreaks of this disease are reported from Cambridge, Pembroke and Denbigh,     So far as can be judged at this date, the amount of disease this year is very much less than during recent years.     The drought of nay and June, and the cold weather prevailing during July, may be factors influencing the appearance and spread of this disease,Amerjcan Gooseberry Mildew, This disease is prevalent in - most fruit growing districts, but few bad attacks have been noted, Bnqu: ries have been made as to the use of Lime Sulphur Spray as a preventive. Many large growers are alive to its value, but owing to scarcity of labour some growers have been unable to spray their plantations, Thore is much evidence to show that the use of Lime Sulphur Spray is becoming popular with growers in Kent and V/isbech,Other Diseases.- Onion Smut,   Search has been made for this disease in several onion-growing districts, but no further outbreak has been reported,     Investigation shows that the disease occurred only in those crops of Onions grown jfrom American Seed, which su^ests that the Seed may have been contaminated with spores of the Smut when imported.     This matter is receiving further attention.Labour Division.Ho demobilisation returns arc available from the Var Office this week;It is evident from the number of applications received through Agricultural Executive Committees and from private individuals that the grant of harvest furlough to skilled men still serving with the Colours will be necessary if the work during the harvest is to be satisfactorily carried on.Some Counties do not anticipate any serious shortage of labour owing to the light crop.     Others report that they will manage if the Prisoners of V/ar are not, withdrawn, but that without these there will be shortage.     In many,cases, however, a serious deficiency is expected especially of skilled labour.omen&apos;s ^ranch.A Conference was held during the week at the Kinistry of Labour on the question of recruiting women to make good the wastage in the Land Army.     A considerable number are leaving the Land Army each weel; as the term of their enrolment is over or as they have other work to which to go.In recruiting women for the Land Army the Ministry of Labour have worked on the basis that recruiting should only be undertaken in each particular district for the ascertained demand. This has been found to be impracticable and it is therefore proposed in future to circi-late particulars of the vacancies in the various Training Centres a month ahead, and to ask the Ministry of Labour  o recruit the number of women required to fill these vacancies in the various parts of England0
The position with regard to the supply of and demand for woman labour remains the same;   it would bo possible to absorb a very much larger number of skilled milkers were they available.Owing to the lightness of the crop fewer women have been required for seasonal work than was originally anticipated; but even so the demands from the farmers were made known too late to enable the .7omenfs Committees completely to supply them.The total number of D.$.Bfs awarded in    the Land Army is now 31,    Of the nine which have been recently awarded, two were given for exceptional skill in work;   four for saving the lives of animals under the girls1 care;   one for saving a fellow worker from being burned to death;   one for courage and presence of mind in averting what might have been a serious fire;   and one for attending to the employers child who was seriously ill with an infectious disease and for whom no nurses.could be obtained.

Dead rats are reported to have been found in the patient1s Office and on adjoining premises,   And a mouse found dead has been proved by bacteriological examination to have suffered from plague. The case for retaining &quot;mice&quot; in the Rats and Mice Destruction Bill is therefore greatly strengthened.An invasion of rats is reported at -West Thurrock (Essex) All appeals to this Local Authority to take  .action, have, however, so far been in vain.In view of the estimates of certain experts that damage to the extent of  1 is caused por rat per annum, the following figures taken at random are interesting:-During the past jjcear 235,789 rats have been destroyed in Herts.In 20 weeks       125,223    M M M Leios.Up to 30th June 22,341    &quot; &quot; &quot; Bucks.Up to 28th July 52,000    &quot; w *       OxfordshireUp to 30th June 64,455    &quot; &quot; &quot; SalopIn 2 months (May-June)62,074    H M *       StaffordshireA Systematic campaign is being organised by the Military Authorities to deal with rats in Military Camps throughout the Country.

A deputation which attended last Tuesday from the British Fresh Herring Export Association sought the Board^s advice as to the opening up of trade with Germany *     It appears that the terms offered by tho Germans in payment for tho herrings wore not satisfactory, and Government assistance was sought as regards the 80 * of tho price which the Germans wished to pay in the form of Bills or      other securities. It appears that the Association had not actually received an offer in writing from the Gorman delegates whom they had recently met at Rotterdam, but had&apos; been led to suppose by the British Food representative that tho Germans were prepared to offer the same terms to the Association as they had offered to tho Curers,     It was suggested that tho   Association should obtain a bena-fido off03 in writing in the first instance .Provision of Research Steamers.   The Developrent Commission have concurred in the Board&apos;s proposal that any research steamers should be constructed by Messrs Ccchrane from the material taken over by the latter from the Admiralty;   and that it would bo unwise for some of the Lord Horsey trawlers now undor construction to be altered in view of their advanced stage of building.Shell Fish Regulations i&apos;rTr tho j&amp;o ffstuary.
