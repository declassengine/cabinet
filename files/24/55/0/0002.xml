Among the subjects dealt with are further negotiations in oonneotion with proposals for fishing operations by Icelandic and Danish boats from ports on the West Coast of England.

It has been decided by the Joint Committee of the Ministry of Food and the Board, that all work at the larger Ports, after the fish arrives, and all questions of supplies to merchants other than oanners and of distribution shall be taken over by the Ministry of Food.    This involves considerable trouble in adjusting at first, but will relieve the Committee of much troublesome work. The transference will probably be effected at the end of three months. The Committee reserve all work in connection with the Canning firms.Freshwater Fish Committee.     The Sub-Committee has made furtherinvestigations into suitable sites for Bel Culture and recommended the allocation of  2,200 for the purpose of developing the Eel fishing under the control of the Sub-Committee, at Christchurch Harbour, Poole Harbour, the Fleet Water and Yarmouth (Bure, Yare and faveney Rivers).     It is believed that large quantities of Eels should be oaptured at all these places and it is hoped that a profit will be shown on the business which is, however, to a degree experimental.    Arrangements are being made for the supply of nets and other necessary gear, and a delegation of the Committee has visited St. Dunstans to arrange for some of the nets to be made by blinded soldiers.    The demand for the Leaflet on the Capture of Eels is still wall maintained and the large net makers, Messrs. Whetham of Bridport, inform the Committee that since its publication the demand for eel nets has surpassed greatly any previous demand since they began business.21st June, 1$18.Secretary.
