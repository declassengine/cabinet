z. lam mmrivitTtie weather for the most part has oontinued cold and barren, and growth has been retarded.   Graces fields seem to have suffered most, and in oertain diotriots especially in the east-tern oountlea. the prospects of a turnip crop are far from bright.    On the other hand the hay that has been out looks welj, in the ewaithe, and in the riek, and grain crepe of all kinds keep their luxuriant appearanoe.1. Compulsory tfrtjLera Under Defence of the Reala Regulation 3M.The Board hare issued an Order under Seotion 1 (0) requiring the oooupler of the tfarm of Kirkbride in Kirkcudbright to make a return to the Secretary of the local Agricultural Executive Conmittee stating (1) the acreage under oats, and (2) the acreage under potatoes, on the farm.the Board propose at an early data to issue a new Order under the Destructive Insects and Pests Acts conferring upon them greater powers to deal with the diseaee known as &quot;Elaok Scab&quot; or &quot;Wart Disease of Potatoes&quot;.    Under this Order, provision will be made for controlling the distribution and sale of those varieties of potatoes that have been proved to be immune to the disease.    This oourse has been rendered neoessary mainly because under the new Order the total &quot;infected area&quot; in&apos; Scotland will be greatly extended and it is essential, therefore, that growers in these areas should have adequate supplies of immune &quot;seed&quot;.The Board have, however, had to take into consideration the further faot that the seed planted in these areas must be pure if the re-appearance of the disease is to be prevented.   It is proposed, therefore, to institute a scheme for the inspection of orope of immune varieties in the months of July and August when the plants are in bloom and the presence of &quot;rogues&quot; in the crop oan be easily detected.    Growers are, therefore, being invited to apply to the Board within the next fortnight giving particulars of the varieties they are growing and the situation of the relative farms.    All crops found to be true to type, reasonably free from &quot;rogues&quot;, and in a generally satisfactory; condition will be certified by the Board.    The growers will be furnished with a oertifioate bearing a number whioh can be quoted in all invoioes relating to vales of seed potatoes drawn from the certified orope, and in this way buyers will be able to identify stocks that have been duly examined and passed as pure. j-jpt.
