7^---t! --$  m rty of     Colonel B. Ball? Jones,13?frflttorandutt by the President of thg,,looaX;0,oYermen^In the meraorandum dated 11th May, 1918,   which I elroulated to the War Cabinet (O.T.4500) I pointed out that it was necessary for the life of Parliament, which now stands extended to 51 at July next, to be further extended, and I sug-gested that the extension should be for 6 montha, viz.- to 31ot January, 1919.   I still think this would be a desirable date. It would, of course, not prevent a dissolution at an earlier date if thought desirable;   it would enable an automatic di$solution to take plaoe after the Autumn Session, at the end of January; or if events were to make a general eleotion inadvisable there would be time to propose a further prolongation.iIt is necessary for the War Cabinet to come to a decision on this natter at an early date.   The Bill for the purpose must be- passed before the and of July.In my previous memorandum I referred to the questionof the looal elections to be held in November next in theabsence of further legislation postponing them,   These, so faras England and Wales are concerned, are the elections ofMetropolitan and Municipal Borough Councils,   Ho elections to9those bodies have been held since 1914, having been postponed by various Acts from time to time.Xn 1916 the ground for postponing the eleotion was the desire to avoid the turmoil end trouble of an election in war time. In ouboequent years there has been the additional argument that the electoral register w&amp;e stale and obsolete. The latter argument will not apply this year as it ie con term-plated that by November there will be a new looal government register in existence, although the register will not contain
the names of naval and military voters who would ordinarily form a large proportion of the electorate.Clearly it ia desirable to resume local eleotiona as soon as may be, and I have consulted the Municipal Corporations Association with a view to ascertaining their views on the subject and also on the proposal that the new Register should be made the occasion of a oomplete new election of the whole Council and not merely of one third aa is customary under the present law.   X find that the Committee of the Association to whom the questions have been referred are distinctly opposed both to the holding of elections next November and to the other proposal.   They oubmit that there are no local questions of importance at the present time nor new schemes involving expend!-ture to be carried out and that .the members of Corporations and their staffs are engaged in local administration connected with the war, which useful work would be seriously interfered with by a Municipal Election.   It has been further represented to me that a large number of Councillors are serving on Committees dealing with war work, e*g, Local Tribunals, Pood Committees, &amp;c,   These men have gained experience and it would be very unfortunate if by their failing to be oleoted their services were lost to the locality.   Their supersession by new members would throw additional work on the already depleted staffs of the Councils.Though I am very anxious that the interruption ofilocal elections should not be unduly prolonged, I   feel there ia much force in the considerations to whioh I have alluded and am disposed to suggest a further postponement of the November elect tens.The other local elections are held in March and April. No question arises with regard to then at the present time. Whether they should be further postponed beyond next Spring must depend on the course of events.W. HAYBS FISHEB,Local Government Board, 24th June, 1918.
