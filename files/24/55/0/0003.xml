II,    Preferences to the Step Ire.The Committee are of opinion that it v/ould be extremely desirable, if it were practicable, to abolish all.-Customs barriers within the Empire.   They recognise, however, that financial and other reasons make it impossible, both for the United Kingdom,and for the Self-Governing Dominions and Colonies, to remit all cus-tons duties upon Empire produce and manufactures, at least in the immediate future.   They therefore confine themselves to reeom- &apos; mending that preferential treatment should be given by the UnitedKingdom to dutiable imports from other parts of the Empire.The Committee recommend:-(a) That a preference should be given to.imports from Empire sources of every article which is at present subject toduty, except where (as in the case of Beer and Spirits) an excise duty corresponding to the import duty is in existence and is of importance to the revenue of the United Kingdom.(b) That it is desirable to grant an Empire......preference,subject to the above except ion,&quot;in all cases where .&amp; new import fluty is imposed, whether On manufac-lured&quot;&quot;or on unmanufactur ed goods.(c) That it is undesirableto create new import duties for the sake of granting an Empire preference,, or generally speaking to raise existing duties for the purpose of granting a preference.(d) That it is desirable to grant such preferences in the form.......of a percentage......rebate on the ordinary duty.(e) That it is desirable to take as the standard rate of Empire preferences 33   /3$ Q  the general rate of duty on&quot; each commodity.   But in exceptional casesit may be found desirable to adopt either (a) a higher rate of preference on the ground that, for the commodity in question, the standard rate of 33 *-/zfo would not give a substantial preference or (b) a lower rate, on the ground that a preference of&quot;l55 1/3$ on the article in question would involve a serious loss of re-venue.CD/417.OOMITTEE ON THiil TRJPE RELATIONS Off THE UNITED KINGDOM ^ITHIN THE EMPIB3SUREPORT on PREFERENCES on DUTIABLE /ARTICLES  .
s82.   Preferences to Allies.(a) The Committee are of opinion that H,M. Government should carefully consider the advisability of granting preferences, in respect of certain of the dutiable articles, to those of the Allies who have made great sacrifices in the common cause,(b) Such preferences to Allies should be based on our obligatl to assist them in repairing the ravages of war;   to grant nreforec to the Empire without extending them to the Allies might in oertal oases aggravate the financial or commercial difficulties of an Ally.    Preferences should only be granted to Allies in cases to which the above conditions apply,   and should usually bo confined to trades or territories which have suffered direct damage resulting from the war.     The precise method by which the policy can be carried into effect must be determined in the li.p:ht of the treaty rights of the Allied powers end in concert with th6m.(c) The Committee do not recommend that preferences should be granted solely for the benefit of colonies of the Allies.(d) The Committee recommend thit any preferences nriven to the products or manufactures of Allied countries should be temporary (i.e. granted for the reconstruction period).     They should in no case exceed, and should not necessarily be as sub-stantial as the ^references granted to the iDrapire on the same commodities.
