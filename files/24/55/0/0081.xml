.1,9th. ......June.__1910.This Report contains a brief account of imports, carports, entrances and clearances, shipping losses, employment of ships and new construction in the last month for which figures are available.A. H. 3TAL&apos;Liii x*.BOARD 02 2RAP3,27th June, 1918.OF mj 191&amp;.1,       In May total imports into the United Kingdom amounted to 3,354,000 tons which is 8$ below the figure for May 1317 and 23$ below that of May 1913.2.       For particular imports the following points nay be noted. t * In Ivlay 1918 imports of grain and flour were down by 1$ as compared with May 1917, but imports of meat wero up by no less than 100$.     There were also large increases in the importation of timber.   On the first five months of 1918 as compared with 1917, wheat and flour wore 18$ lower, meat 29$ up, and timber 27$ tip.   Raw wool was down 35$ and raw cotton 5$, raw jute was down no loss than 45$.    For a number of important commodities eompari-son with the early months of 1917 is impossiblo because Government-owned goods (except food) were excluded from the returns before July 1917.3.       Total exports in May amounted to,3,500,000 tons, which is 18$ below the figure for May 1917.   Goal exports amounted to 3,050,000 tons, or 17$ less than in May 1917. Most important manufactures sho?f a reduction in tonnage on May 1917    iron and steel of 29$, wool manufactures of 23$, and&apos;other textiles1 of no;less than 74$.      Cotton manufactures were only down 15$,      For the five months ending May,the tonnage of all manufactures exported was down 28$ as compared with 1917, that of coal ?/as down 11$. As compared with the first five months of 1913 manufactures were down 64$, coal 55$ and the total weight of oxports of all kinds 56$.
4.       A Table (V) has been prepared to snow tho changes that have taken place In the direction of British exports during the war.    As was to be expected, tho first quarter of 1918 as compared with the first quarter of 1914 shows a large increase in the value of oxporta1 to Franco, Italy, Egypt and East Africa - consequent, no doubt, upon military operations.      ports to Kusela and Scandinavia and to distant countries, notably Australasia, British India, and Japan, have, on the other hand, very greatly diminished,      &apos;i1o British possessions as a whole, the value of our exports in the first quarter of 1918 y/as 83^ of what it was in the corresponding period of 1914: and to foreign countries (not including enemy countries) 105$.      Of course, when account is taken of the great riso in prices, both theso figures imply large contractions in the quantity of exports.5.       kVhile imports in May were down 23  on 1913 the entrances of British and Foroign vessels (with earro) were down 53^;   and while imports were down 8&apos;;u on 1917 tonnage ehtranoes were down 3;j.    Thus, as against 1915 the loading factor Is 63^ greater and as against 1917 5)o loss,6.       In May, British ontrancos with cargo (other than requisitioned vessels) amounted to 1,698,000 net tons, that is 5$ more than in ivlay 1917.      In April there had be on a percentage increase of 10^ on 1917.      British clearances (other thsn requisitioned vessels) were 931,000 tons -Wjo lose thkn in May 1917\ compared with a decroase of z0-/p in April,    Foreign entrances amounted to H5S,OC0 tons, . -35ft less than in May 1917 - as against a decrease of 19  in the previous month - and foreign clearances to 654,000 tons, -23;* less than in May 1917.7.       In May total losses of British shipping, of over 500 G,T, amounted to 203,000 gross tons of which 167,000 tons v/ere due to war risk.   War Iosse3 during the precoding four months were at the rats of 206,000 kens per month. The May figure thus ishows a decided improvoment and is well under the forecast of 225,000 tons a month.   In May the now vessels over 500 tons built in 3ritish yards and brought into service amounted to 195,000 tons.     ibis is the most satisfactory figure for any month of tho year. There wore also 30,000 tons transferred from foreirn flags other than Norwegian, and 12,&apos;JOO tons transferred from tho lorwogian flag.      The grand total of gains amounted to 243,000 tons.Thus, evon when account is taken of the fact that since vossols transferred from the Norwegian flag have to be replaced under the Norwegian agreement and&apos; therefore shoxild not bo counted as additional tonnage available for service, the gains were decidedly in excess of the losses (War looses and marine losses together).    The tonnage brought into service from British yards and by purchase of new vessels abroad only just fell short or the aggregate losses.8.       war losses of the allies (other than British) in May were 60,000 tons as against 45,000 in April and 94,000 in March, and of neutrals 2O,0C0 tons as against
14,000 tons in April and 51,000 in March.   The average of world war losses to British, Allied and Neutrals combined over the first five months of 1918 amount to just 300,000 tons a month.9. On April 30th. - tho figure for May 31st.is not yet available - as compared with March 31st. the employment of the British Mercantile steam fleet over 500 tons had changed as follows	1000 tons at , April 30th,	Change since it March___Vessels repairing and	963	+U0launched &quot;but not eomplotod..	334	- 18	1,297	+122	3,143	- 19	544	- 56	20 217 1,761	mm * 56 +409	1,173	Ml-	1,066	* 18Remainder available for 3ritish trade other than	6,275	-473fotal read? for use.........	14,220     1    - 65	6PcUr:c i10fAl...........	15,517	t 57It thus appears that during April the total toan* ;o fit for service decreased &quot;by 65,000 tons, th&amp;t tharo was a decided further increase in the tonnage loaned to the United Sts-ios in connection, no doubt, with the transport of troop3, and a largo increase in the tonnage in the service of Franco and Italy due presumably to the coal difficulties caused by the new German advance.   As a result of those inarches the tonnage available for British trade fall off by nearly half a million.tons.10.        he&apos;table below gives the absolute and the percentage incrcrsos and decreases of vessels over 500 tons thit have - taken plc-.ee between April 30 th. 1917 and April 30th. 1918 in the several employments of\

The United States have absorbed more than all the tonnage that lias been released from the ser-vice of Ruesia.       But, owing principally to a large reduction in the vessels in the service of the Army and ll&amp;vy, the tonnage aiailable for British trade appears to have fallen off only 644,000 tons or 9* .     In consequence however, of uncertainty in the figure for vessels per-manently abroad, on account of the change made in January in the method of classification no great stress can be laid on this figure.    Furthermore, it must be remembered that in April 1917, when our comparison bogins the tonnage of vessels available for United Kingdom trade was already enormously domlnishod below the figure for normal times,11.

Thus the total tonnage undergoing repair was just under l-  million tons, or nearly 100,000 tons less than a month ago.This figure does not correspond with that given in the Tables in sections 9 and 10 taken from the Ministry of Shipping lie turns which include only vessels requiring more sorious repair.TOTAL   WOimImports000&apos;    tons1917 May June July August September October November December1918 January FebruaryMarch April MayTotal (5 mouths) T0^iLJ917TOTAL 1916 TO Till 19133,647/3,390/3,4213,3032,8682,8862,9442,3042,730 2,559 2,772 3,087 3,35414,502 37,23046,390 54,549/   Including an allowance for Government owned goods,
