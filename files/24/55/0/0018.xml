CULTIVATION IN RICHMOND &amp; BUSHY PARKS.The crops generally, especially the wheat,, have improved owing to the recent rain, and are looking very wella     The only crop, which, so far, has not succeeded is the mangolds, of which some have failed to come up, the explanation is probably that the seed was not all of equal quality.     Where it has failed, swodes, or turnips are being sown.The oats which received a second drilling, look remarkably well, the second sowing being little behind the first sown crop.      The effects of the wire worm have in this manners been very largely overcome, and the additional expense involved will, it is hoped, provo to hrave been fully justified.Tho oats In Richmond Park show an improvement on last year, but much of tho ground which it was at first proposed to abandon this yoar, is of such a nature that it will require several years of cultivation to convert into good arable soil.     It comprises^&apos; however, several acres of Potatoes and beans, the crops from which will, it is hoped, well repay the labour and money expended on them, and tho returns from this Park Bhould be more satisfactory than last year. There was a front on the morning of the 17th.(Sd.) LIONEL EARLE.
