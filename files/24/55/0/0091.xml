Confidential.Political Intelligence Department;June 27th, 1918.Foreign OffioS.-AUSTRIA/007.The Resignation of- the Austrian Cabinet.MEMORANDUMon theThe latest crisis in Austria, which made the government abandon the idea of reopening Parliament on June 18th, was caused by the&apos; Poles discovering tha$ at Brest-Lit orsk the Central Powers had promised the Ukrainians to form the Ukrainian part of Galicia into a separate province, i,e., to withdraw it from Polish dominion.For the last few weeks the Austrian government and the Austrian Germans had been negotiating with the Polish Club with a view to forming a compact government majority.    The Minister for Galioia, M. Twardowski, served as intermediary, and the negotiations had progressed a considerable way - as the &quot;Neue Freie Presse&quot; put it, &quot;the Poles were not yet married to theGermans but were engaged.......&apos;&quot;     &quot;It was already possible toformulate the different points of the treaty of alliance.&quot;The Poles demanded that the German parties in Austria should support the Austrian Solution of the Polish Question (a union of Austrianand Russian Poland under the Habsburgs) anduse all their influence in Berlin to obtain Germany1s consent to that scheme.    They were further to safeguard Russian Poland against annexations on the part of Germany to obtain for Poland the entire Cholm district, thus also its Ukrainian parts, to secure for her free navigation on the Vistula and such a regulation of the frontier in Lithuania as would r;ake Polish territory intervene between Lithuania and the Ukraine and create an immediate frontier between Poland and Russia.    Further the
m    2    **293German parties in the Austrian Parliament were to stand by the Poles In case of differences with the Ukrainians, i.e., prevent I    the establishment of an Ukrainian autonomous province in East-Galicia, and were to secure for Galicia the financial and economic compensations due to it for war damages and requisitions.The Poles, on the other hand, were to support the German plans with regard to Mittel-Europa.    Further they were to vote for the Austrian Budget and war credits and in general help to secure for Dr. von Soldier&apos;s government all &quot;the necessities of State&quot;.    The Germans favour Dr, von Seidler&apos;s government because it has $ranted their Nationalist demands in Bohemia and because it lias promised to suppress the Jugo-Slav movement in Austria?s southern provinces, and fear that its fall might endanger these new German &quot;acquisitions&quot;.     It was certain that the Czechs said Jugo-Slavs would attack the government as soon as Parliament meet s^ and seek a vote condemning the measures which it had taken in accordance with the German demands.     The German Nationalists therefore demanded that the Polish Club in the Vienna Parliament should pledge itself to vote with the Germans on the questions which the Czechs and Jugo-Slavs were i    expected to raise.    Lastly the Poles were to pledge themselves&quot;adopt steps detrimental to the Germans&quot;.    This was described as the formation of a defensive majority (&quot;Abwehrmajoritlit \ The negotiations were progressing when suddenly on June 10th a meeting of the Parliamentary Committee of the Polish Club passed resolutions refusing to vote credits for Dr, von Sekdler&apos;s Cabinet and demanding its resignation.The Polish Club in the Vienna Parliament consists at present of about sixty members, of rhom thirty-five follow the lead of the Cracow aristocracy , and about twentyrfive are peasants; the eight Socialist and seven National Democrat members withdrew from the Club last March.     The aristocracy and landedto stand by the Germans
m   O   mgentry in Galicia, as everywhere else in Poland, incline to compromise with the &quot;power3 that be&quot;.    They are absolutely devoid of Slav feelings and pride themselves on being &quot;something more Uian Slav3!&apos;.     Between 1903 and 1915 it suited certain Polish parties under Russia to enact a Pan-Slav comedy, but this was merely to please their then masters - wMxtiPwoja speedily dropped when the power of those masters had vanished.    The Polish peasants, on the other hand, have retained much more of the original Slav element and have sincere Slav sympathies; the words addressed to the Polish nation by one of its greatest poets - &quot;you have always been the peacock and parrot among the nations&quot; - do not apply to the serfs who did not share in the delightful game of cultural mimicry.     Nor do the peasants believe in back-stairs diplomacy to which the Polish upper classes are fondly devoted.     These peasant members in the Vienna Parliament would have in any case been reluctant to conclude an anti-Slav alliance with the German parties and to vote credits to a government which requisitions their cows and fails to rebuild their barnf&apos; &quot;burnt down when Galicia was the scene of warfare.    Yet lacking in leaders of real ability and strong character, they are amenable to different kinds of persuasion and might in the end have been induced to agree to the compromise.That the negotiations between the Austrian Germans and the Poles should now suffer a sudden interruption is due to an egregious blunder of Count Czernin, a counterpart to his Cholm blunder.     There is one point on which the Polish nobility will never compromise, and that is where its own class Interests are concerned - in matters of Polish imperialism: in other words they will not abandon the big landed estates owned by Polish noblemen in Ukrainian country.     East-Galicia Is almost purely Ukrainian, but the big landed estates belong to Poles.    Were East-Galicia formed into a separate autonomous province, the
90 C   J .3Polish landowning gentry would come under the government of its own peasants.    How the land-owning $entry of Galicia forms one united circle, and although the Cracow aristocracy, the most statesman-like among the Polish Conservatives, are the intellect-ual leaders, numerically the East-Galician interest Is predominant within the Galician gentry group.    9be*economic, political and social existence is Ws^ttJfiJto^bouncl up with the &quot;in-divisibility of Galicia&quot;.It is not clear how it has happened that the Poles became aware of the promises concerning East Galicia made to the Ukrainians at Brest-Litovsk.    Rumours about such promises were current at the time when the treaty was concluded; they vere denied and thereupon subsided.    Recent developments, however, were calculated to rouse onoe more the suspicions of the Poles. On the dissolution of the Ukrainian Rada and the establishment of the Conservative Great Russian government of Skoropadaki one would have expected a most violent outburst from the Ukrainian members of the Austrian Parliament; but they remained comparatively quiet, did not pass into opposition against the Austrian Government and merely sent a deputation to Herr von Euhlmann.     Further the Vienna papers seemed to assume the possibility of the Ukrainians and Poles both voting with the government - a truly incomprehensible proposition explicable on no other assumption than that one side would be acting under a misapprehension.    Lastly, when Dr. von Sei&amp;ler demanded from the parties that they should by June 15th let him know what attitude they would take up on the reassembling of Parliament, the Ukrainians answered (on June 8th) that they would give him their final answer to June.14thj i.e., at the&quot;last moment. Translated into explicit language, this meant that they had nothing more to discuss and merely wanted to see whether Dr. von Seidler would not In the course of the negotiations with the Poles accede to certain demands which would necessitate
&quot;5- 29a change in the Ukrainian attitude.    As Galicia is now all in Polish hands, it would have seemed that the Poles we the &quot;beati possidentes&quot;.    But the Ukrainians acted as if it had . been they who were in that position.    Warned by some such sign or other, the Polish Club sent one of its leading members to Dr. von Seidler to inquire whether there was any truth in the rumours that the Ukrainians had been promised autonomy for East-Galicia.    The Prime Minister was by no means reassuring.    He said that &quot;if, as is alleged, confidential promises have been made, then it is not for him to speak about them&quot;.This was too much even for the Polish Conservatives, however keen they are on compromise with the Austrian government. On June 10th the Parliamentary Committee of the Polish Club met at Cracow and resolved unanimously that the Poles are prepared to continue discussions with other parties in the Austrian Parliament provided that these undertake to guarantee the indivisibility of Galicia and to protect Russian Poland against annexations (clearly the Slavs can do neither of these tilings)] but at the same time the Poles accused Dr. von Seidlerfs government of having assumed &quot;a directly hostile attitude in the Polish Question&quot; and demanded its resignation,threatening to refuse to vote the financial bills.    The 60 members of the Polish Club hold the balance between the 170 German nation-alists who support the government and the opposition composed of 170 Czechs, Jugo-Slavs end German Socialists, and with them lies the decision of the Parliamentary&quot;fate of the Cabinet. &quot;The main reason for the sudden hostility (of the Poles) against the government     wrote the i;Keue Freie Presse&quot; on June 11th, &quot;is the accusation that it has not safeguarded the indivibility of Galicia&quot;.In the discussions vMch ensued several admissions followed which throw light on the alleged agreement between
- 6 *the Austrian government and the Ukrainians concerning East-Galicia.    Thus, for instance, in a leading article published in the &quot;Keue Freie Presse&quot; on June, 12th it was pointed out that &quot;the successor (of Dr. von Sei&amp;ler) would not be able to tear up the treaty of Brest-Litovsk because Austrian Prime Ministers have no such powers and because our allies also have a word to say about it&quot;.     In other words, it was admitted that a promise concerning East Galicia had been given to the Ukrainians by the common lustro-Kiingarian Minister for Foreign Affairs who is not a member of tie Austrian Cabinet, and that it had in some way been guaranteed by Germany.    In the sitting of the Hungarian Parliament of June 12th Dr. wekerle, answering a question, stated as follows: &quot;As far as the Ukrainian question is concerned, I can only say that the treaty with the Ukraine has not yet been ratified.&quot;    Thus Dr. Wekerle seems to have been unable to deny the rumour whioh is most disquieting to the Magyars also.    But on the same day on which he gave the answer quoted above Dr. V/ekerle received representatives of the Polish Conservatives who had come to discuss with him,among ether things, the question of East Galicia; and in an interview given to the &quot;Neue Freie Presse&quot; on June 17th M. Twardowski did not deny the allegation made by the interviewer to the effect that Dr. Wekerle has lodged a protest against an Ukrainian autonomous province being set up in East Galicia.    The Magyars who oppress in the most ruthless manner the 250,000 Ukrainians inhabiting the Carpathian district on Hungaryfs north-eastern frontier, have an Immediate interest in East Galicia remaining under the Polish thumb-rule.     Should the just demands of the Ukrainians be granted in East-Galicia, a new complication would arise in Hungarian politics.The sudden onslaught of the Polish Club against Dr. von Seidler caused much embarrassment and dissatisfaction among the
German Nationalist parties who do not wish for the fall of a government pledged to anti-Czech aid anti-Slovene measures. Henoe new difficulties arose &quot;between the Polish Parliamentary Club and the German parties.&apos;    We lack detailed information about event3 later than June 19th, but Judging by a Reuter telegram from Amsterdam dated June 23rcl, the plenary meeting of the Polish Club assumed a conciliatory attitude towards the Germans though not towards Dr. von Seidler,    The resolu-tions unanimously accepted by the Club start by asserting &quot;that the maintenance and strengthening of the Austro-Eungarian Monarchy. Is in the interest of the Polish nation&quot;.    The Club then proceeds to declare &quot;its reac&amp;ness to negotiate with all psarties willing to form a majority with a view to agreement on some basis for ordered Parli em entary activity&quot;.    A majority on pro-Austrian basis can clearly be formed In co-operation with the Germans alone and never with the Czechs and Jugo-Slavs.8The executive of the German Nationalist parties on the other hand addressed a letter to the Polish Minister for Galicia declaring their readiness to discuss with the Poles all questions which are of interest to them,with a view to co-operation between Germans and Poles &quot;on the condition that the Poles showed a united front to the dangerous plans of the Czechs , and Jugo-Slavs&quot;.    The German Nationallets on their part seem -quite  prepared to abandon the Ukrainians; their mouthpiece , the &quot;Neue Freie Presse&quot;, published on June 19th a leading article openly advocating that the  treaty of Brest-Litovsk should be disregarded - &quot;the only real thing about it was the ink with which it was written&quot;.    It remains to be seen whether the peasant members of the Polish Club will agree to such a &quot;united front&quot;.So far it is impossible to determine the meaning of Dr. von Seidler&apos;s resignation in conjunction with the Polish-
German negotiations, but the Emperor&apos;s answer seems to indicate that the Emperor himself will try to bring about an underetand-ing between the German Nationalists and the Polish Parliamentary Club.
