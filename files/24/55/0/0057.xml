This Document is the property of His Uritannic Majesties Government. SECRET,G.T. -1050.   (Printed for the War Cabinet.)&apos;THE SITUATION IN INDIA.NOTE BY Mr. CHAMBERLAIN.The Taper, G.T. -1877, circulated by the Secretary of State for India, raises very serious questions. My experience confirms what Mr. Montagu says of the doubt prevailing among Indians, quite unjustifiably as I think, as to the good faith of the British Government in carrying out the declarations which have from time to time been made in Royal Proclamations or in Government pronouncements on Indian affairs. Even those who recognise our good faith assert that the opposition or inertia of the Authorities and Services in India is stronger than the good intentions of the British Govern-rnent. These doubts and fears are used by the ill-intentioned to foment dissatisfaction and to feed agitation. It lias happened more than once that in the long process of consideration and consultation, with different local Governments in India, and while proposals and criticisms are bandied backwards and forwards among them, reforms are so delayed or whittled down as to lose all their effect. Opinion becomes first impatient and then exasperated. By the time the Government takes action the moderates have lost heart and faith, the extremists have got possession of the field, and changes which, made at once and as a free gift, would have satisfied public opinion for at least a fair term of years, no longer meet with acceptance in any quarter, and the Government finds itself forced, when it does act, to a more extreme course of action than would have been necessary if it had been possible to act earlier.The disquieting factors to which Mr. Montagu refers render these considerations, which at any time would have their importance, of peculiar consequence at the present moment. They lead Mr. Montagu to propose, first, that \\re demonstrate our good faith by the fulfilment of the Anuounce-ment of the 20th of August; secondly, that we increase the pay offered to Indian sepoys from Imperial sources; thirdly, that we assist India in its currency crisis or demonstrate that we cannot do any more, and fourthly, that we ask the Commander-in-Chief to raise a second fine Army for the defence of India.I do not propose to offer any observations at this stage upon the last proposal. In respect of currency I am afraid that it is impossible to give India the help of which she stands in need, but advantage should be taken of the presence in England of Sir S. Sinha as the representative of the Indian Government to put him in full possession of our case, and the Government of India should be supplied, if this lias not already been clone, with a clear and full statement of the difficulties with which we are confronted.As regards the pay of the Indian sepoys, I will only say that I think it would require, a much stronger case than the Secretary of State has presented to convince us that it is right that this burden should be thrown on the heavily taxed people of this country, except in so far as Indian troops . hieing employed in Imperial operations outside India are paid by the Imperial Treasury.But even if we adopted the proposals of the Secretary of State in these three matters, there would remain the danger of doubt arising as to the reality of our determination to give effect to the announcement of the 20th August, and the probability that in the interval before any action is taken public opinion may pass out of control and that reforms which would be readily accepted if begun at once may fail to satisfy by the time their execution is approved.-I am therefore uneasy at the thought that the Report of the Viceroy and the Secretary of State will be published without any expression of opinion by His Aiajesty&apos;s Government, and that all action will be postponedss 627-5
0Lifor an indefinite period. I think that this course will, in fact, commit the British Government more deeply than a &quot;discriminating approval ol certain of its main conclusions, both positive and negative, would have done. Above all, I fear that the delay in taking definite action will favour the extremists and will throw into their ranks men whom we might retain on the side of Government. I fear that when we do take up the consideration of the Report we shall-thus be forced to go further than would now be necessary. It is true that the-numbers of extremists, and indeed the whole political class in India, are very small in comparison with the total population, but all. the information which reaches me tends to show that their influence is spreading, that Home Rule is becoming a familiar word in village talk where it stands as the symbol for changes vaguely described and dimly understood, and varying -with the particular needs and aspirations of the different classes in the different localities on whose ears it falls. But, however ignorant politically the mass of Indians may be, it would be a great mistake to ignore or under-rate the influence which the Indian politician is beginning to acquire among them, and the necessity for acting before that influence has gone too far.11 ask myself, therefore, whether, whilst accepting the Cabinet decision in regard to the announcement to be made on the publication of the Report, it is not possible to give an earnest of our good intentions by immediate action in certain limited spheres without trenching on seriously contentious ground, and I venture to make suggestions with this object.The Report of the Viceroy and the Secretary of State proposes (para-graph 51 of Summary) that complete popular control in local bodies should be established as far as possible. In paragraph 53 of the same Summary it is proposed that a Committee should be appointed to advise upon the possible line of separation between all-Indian and provincial functions, and to recommend which of the functions assigned to the provinces should be transferred subjects. In paragraph 51 it is proposed that a second Com-mittee should be appointed to prepare a scheme of constituencies and franchises, and for the composition of a Legislative Council in each province and of the Legislative Assembly.I would propose that the policy of popularising the local bodies should be formally approved and the Government of India and Provincial Govern-ments should lie encouraged to proceed with it at once. I believe that this policy would meet with general acceptance, and, having in view the larger changes which are contemplated, it is of the utmost importance that the political education of Indians in purely local affairs should he proceeded with as rapidly as possible. I would propose also that the Committee to advise upon the separation of functions and the division between reserved and transferred subjects should be appointed as soon as possible. It could be made clear that the appointment of the Committee did not bind the Cabinet to the acceptance of the particular scheme proposed, in the Report, but it would have the two-fold advantage of saving time if the Cabinet ultimately approved the Report, and of enabling them to form their judgment on a scheme which had been fully worked out. If it were possible 1 should like the Second Committee for the same reasons to examine and report upon the question of constituencies and franchises and upon the composition of the Legislative Councils and Legislative Assembly.I submit these proposals for the consideration of the Government in the firm conviction that the more plain it is made that we are determined to act up to the spirit of the Declaration of 20th August, and to keep in our own hands control of the movement for reform, the less will be the danger of violent agitation and the more conservative the evolution of Indian politics. My conviction is that unless we lead the movement we shall be unable to control it, and that what may at first sight appear the bolder course will undoubtedly in the long run prove to be the safer plan.A. C.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., 26th June 1918.1 Since this paper was written I hav.e received a private letter from the Viceroy strongly urging tins view.   See Appendix.
APPENDIX.Extract from a private teller from Lord Chel ins ford to Mr. Chamberlain,dated nth May 1918.&quot; J. think I am not far wrong in. saying that, though you were not a party technically to that statement of policy (i.e., the announcement of 20th August), you were not a dissentient to it. But there is a party in England, of which Sydenham is the leader, who, while doing lip-service to that policy, are out to wreck it if they can. They let pass no opportunity of striking at it, and by their jeers and flouts and. jibes at the educated Indian, they are driving them to a state of exasperation which will seriously militate against the acceptance of any amending constitutional proposals. I would ask you to consider this-the educated classes, who are the product of our rule, are almost to a man against the Government. I doubt whether you could find in the Universities a student who is not thoroughly hostile to our rule. Surely this fact, and 1 fear it is indisputable, should give us grave cause to think. It may be that at present they are a small percentage of the population, but every day increases their number. It may be that they stand apart at present from the bulk of the population, but every day is bringing them into closer touch, with their fellow countrymen ; and further, through the fact of their common colour and race, they can influence them more than is possible for any official, I am forced therefore to the conclusion that our only policy is to endeavour to enlist their co-operation. And you, 1 think, in ^your criticism of our original Reform proposals, put your finger on the weak spot in these proposals, when you said-1 am - speaking without the hook that they did not offer them responsibility. Well, the scheme which Montagu, and I have been hammering out during the last six months proposes an advance along the line of responsibility, and I sincerely hope it will have your support. But the point of my letter is this we cannot get Indian co-operation unless we can induce people, even if they dislike our scheme, to abstain from that carping and sneering at the capacity of the educated Indian, which cuts like the lash of a whip. No one can have lived as I have done now for over two years in close contact with educated Indians without being fully alive to their defects, and much, no doubt, of what is said is absolutely true, but one must have patience. It was&apos;once&apos;said of Ireland that it wanted 20 years&apos; resolute rule. I would say of India that it wants 20 years&apos; of patient rule. We shall see many things done foolish]y, many things done wrongly, but what is the alternative except to do them ourselves and have growing up a large and discontented class with no scope for employment, but with an ever-widening sphere of possibilities for mischief, until we ail go over the precipice together? . . . . Though the Report is his (Montagu&apos;s) and mine, its proposals are, I may say, practically the accepted proposals of my colleagues and his.&quot;
