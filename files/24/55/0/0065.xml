Nste by tlie secretary of State for War.I 7&apos;&quot;,Hi f nffX217With reference to V/ar Cabinet 430 (7) and G.T.4661 and 4752, do not feel justified in withholding the subjoined note by tho Silitary Members of the Army Council on the subject.   At the saner time iy own view is, as I have informed the Military Members, that, whatever jay bo the objections to the. grant of these commissions on military grounds, tha arguments in favour of it, based on tha broadest consider^ afeiona of policy, outweigh them.26th June, 191 a. Milner.The Military Members of the Army Council, having considered the ,ecision of the War Cabinet No.430 of 12th June, 1918, respectfully re-l*st that a record should be made by the War Cabinet, to the effect that he Military Members are unable to depart from the view taken by the lr.my Council in regard to the granting of commissions to natives of India, rliich was conveyed to the Under Secretary of State for India in War Office etter No.l00./lndia/l830 (M.8.1.) dated the 5th July, 1917 a copy of which s attached, except under the restrictions recorded at a meeting at the l?ar Office between the War Office and the India Office representatives in pril last, at which agreement was reached on the following points 4-(i) That an announcement of the grant of 10 permanent King1 a Commissions per annum, through Sandhurst as in para.(i) of 8*of S* *e telegram 828 of 6th April night be made,(li) Also that announcement of grants of King?s Commissions to maximum of 20 selected Indian officers specially disting-uished in the war night be made, with the condition laid down in latter part of para. 38 of Despatch Ho.67 of 3rd August, via., that each selection &quot;should be subject to the recommendation of the three senior British officers of the regiment and should be conditional on the latter being pre-pared to accept the- nominee as a second lieutenant In their own regiment.&quot;(iii) That announcement might be made of the grant of honoraryKing*8 Commissions to old and distinguished Indian officers still on tho active list, up to an establishment of one per Infantry battalion and other arms in proportion; this established number to be filled up gradually.The Military Members have no desire to criticise in any way the iaoision arrived at by the War Cabinet, and they will in the future use th Iheir beet endeavours to carry out tho policy determined on.   At the same lime they feel th*y would fail in their duty as the recognised military Mhrisers of the Government if they did not place on record their consider-Id opinion that from a military point of view a grave risk will in the pture be run by the contemplated grant of commissions to natives, by Tiich natives will be placed in positions from which they will be enticed ft command white officers. A further resulting effect will, in the opinion the Military Members, be the failure of the supply of British Officers f the right stamp for service with the Indian Army.(Intd.)

ton July,. 191?.100/lndia/lSBO.   (M.S.I.)Sir,With reference to your letter M.11*19108&apos; of the 2nd. June, 1917, on the subject of granting commissions in the Indian Army to nine officers of the Indian Land FcDrbee, I am commanded by the Army Council to inform you that after the most careful consideration they have come to the conclusion that to grant commissions to natives of India would entail a great risk from a military point of view in that it involves placing native Indian offioers ixa a position where they would be entitled tt command European officers.   For this reason the Council are not prepared to take the responsibility of, advising suoh a step.The Council further suggest that the question might be deferred for consideration at the olose of the war, together with many other Imperial matters effecting the Army as a whole, all of which vd 11 then be brought forward for review.I am,Sir, &apos;:;.,Your obedient servant,(Sd.) R.H.Brade,.The Under Secretary of State for India, Military Department, India Office.
