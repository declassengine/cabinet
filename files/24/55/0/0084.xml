One German seaplane was shot down and two prisoners taken. One of our seaplanes flown from the light cruiser &quot; Galatea &quot; is missing, but is presumed to be the machine reported as having landed in Denmark owing to engine trouble and fog.On 20th June an enemy submarine attacked a fishing fleet about 100 miles from Foula Island. The armed fishing boat &quot; Conan Doyle,&quot; which was in charge of the fishing section, engaged the submarine, which withdrew without damaging the fishing vessels.On 22nd June the airship N.S. 3, whilst on patrol, came down in the sea six miles from Dunbar. The engines sank and the envelope was wrecked, but five of the crew were rescued by the Destroyer &quot; Moy,&quot; the remaining five being drowned.A number of reconnaissances and patrols have been carried out in various areas by R.A.F. machines employed on naval duty.Machines from Dunkirk have, in addition, made the following raids :-Date.June  15-16tHObjective.Approximate weight ofbombs dropped.Flanders area.Results observed or remarks.16th 16-17th17th17-18th18th .21st 22ndLa Brugeoise Works        ......Zeebrugge and Bruges CanalBruges Docks............Thourout Railway Junction  and&apos;aerodrome............Ostend Docks        .........Bruges Docks, Ostend Docks, Zee-brugge, Ghistelles and Aertrycke Bruges Docks, Ostend Docks, Zee-brugge, St. Denis Westrem andMaria Aelter Bruges Docks............Ostend Docks and ZeebruggeLa Brugeoise Works, Maria Aelter Aerodrome, Thourout Railway Junction, Bruges Docks and Os-t end Docks..........Ostend Docks and Bruges Docks ...Zeebrugge .........Bruges Docks, St. Pierre Capelle, Ostend Docks and Mariakerke ...

Submarines During the week under review from six to eleven large enemy submarines have been operating. located, one of these being of the converted &quot; Deutschland &quot; type which was still operating off the United States coast. Two other large boats were working to the westward of the English Channel, and the remainder were on passage to their operating areas. The Irish Sea has this week been almost entirely clear of submarines, and there are indications that it is the enemy&apos;s intention that their larger submarines should operate further west of the southern approaches to the British Isles than has been their practice during recent months.Actions The following Table shows the number of actions between Allied craft and enemywith enemy submarines which are reported to have taken place in all waters during recent weeks, and the nature of the craft which have been engaged; and also the number of submarines which have been destroyed as the result of such actions: submarines.

The number of vessels lost by enemy action during the week under review is the lowest recorded in any week since the commencement of unrestricted submarine warfare. The total tonnage lost is relatively higher, owing to the fact that the figures for this week include a large vessel of over 8,000 tons.The Table in Appendix I shows the numbers and tonnage of sailings and of losses Losses ofby enemy action and the percentage of losses to sailings of &quot;all merchant steamships both BritishBritish and Foreign of over 500 tons gross register and the Table in Appendix II is and Foreign a summary of those percentages for recent weeks.Steamships in Trades.There is a slight reduction in the amount of -tonnage which this week arrived at or left United Kingdom ports, but the losses are very much smaller than in the previous week. The percentage of losses to sailings in United Kingdom Overseas trades during the week is -26 as against -94 in the previous week, in Cross-Channel trades is -16 as against -89, and in Coasting trades there are no losses as against -63 last week, while as regards all United Kingdom trades the percentage is -15 as against -83 in the previous week.The Table in Appendix III is a comparative statement.of all merchant vessels, Foreign Areas as well as British, damaged and unsuccessfully attacked in the last two weeks by enemy in which craft and by mine, classified according to areas. vessels lost.The figures in this Table indicate very much reduced activity in Home Waters and in the Mediterranean, and the total number of attacks made during the week are the lowest yet recorded, the number in the week ended May 25th, when less tonnage was sunk, having been 31 as against only 13, so far reported as having been made, in the week under review.The number of British and Foreign merchant vessels sailing in organised convoy Vessels which completed their voyages during last week, and the losses sustained whilst convoyed, in such convoys, compared with corresponding figures for previous periods, are as follows : 	Weekly average,		Week ended		Week ended		Week ended		May, 1918.		8th June.		15th June.		22nd June.

This is especially noticeable in the Cross-Channel and Coasting trades, as is shown by the following Table : Trade.	Average Tonnage of Vessels.				Sailing.	Sunk.	Damaged.

In the latter area the minelaying has developed into a large operation which the enemy appears anxious to complete, and, from the data&apos; at present available, it is inferred that the object of this large mined area is tactical, as it lies in the vicinity of the route which the Grand Eleet would be likely to follow if proceeding southwards from Scapa. The minesweeping force in this region has been reinforced to the full extent which is at present practicable.The following table shows the number of enemy mines destroyed and British vessels sunk by mine in Home Waters (including the Havre and Cherbourg areas) in recent weeks: Week Ended.Number of Enemy Moored Mines Destroyed.Number of British Mine-sweepers and Patrols Sunk bv Mines.Number of British Merchant Steamships Sunk by Mines.May 11th 18th ,,   25th June 1st ,,  8th 15th 22nd37 50 39 34 48 18 34Nil Nil2Nil Nil111Nil Nil Nil 1Nil NilThe vessel sunk this week is a drifter which was mined in the Lowestoft area.
MOVEMENTS OF ENEMY SHIPS.During the week under review five enemy merchant ships arrived at and three sailed Merchant-from Norwegian ports outside the Cattegat.    No enemy ships have- entered or left men. Rotterdam.FOREIGN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE. Russia.Allied warships have been officially informed that they must leave the Nor&apos;ih Russian ports, but it is admitted by the Russian authorities that these instructions were given in order to pacify Germany and that it is not expected that they should be carried out.H.M. Government have arranged for the immediate despatch of rations for 48,000 persons (including 23,000 railway employees) in Northern Russia for three months, and the United States Government have been asked, to arrange for the provisioning of Murmansk province after the end of September.One Dreadnought battleship and four destroyers are reported to have returned to Sevastopol from Novorossisk, but there are conflicting reports as to the other Dread-nought battleship and the destroyers which remain at the latter port, one of which is to the effect that lack of personnel prevents their transfer to Sevastopol, and another that they have been blown up by their crews.The British merchant vessels &quot; Wolverton,&quot;   Thistleton &quot; and &quot; Trevorian &quot; are at Sevastopol, flying the German flag.Spain.Three further cases of Allied merchant vessels being attacked by German submarines in Spanish territorial waters have been reported recently, the victims in each case being sailing ships. Two of these ships were taken outside territorial waters by the crew of a submarine and then sunk by bombs.China.It is officially announced that on June 9th, owing to the disturbed conditions prevailing, Japanese marines were landed at Swatow..Naval Staff,21th June, 1918.[Appendices.
