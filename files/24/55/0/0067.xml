n p   / QTHIS DOCUiJBHT IS THE PROPERTY OJ HIS BRIT AMI 0 MAJESTY *.S OOVt. 220MEMO BY MR.G.ET. BARNES.SECRET G.T.4906 ON.LABOUR MISSIONS TO &amp; PROM AMERICA(PREVIOUS PAPER ft, T. 3869)1. A mission of four representative Trade Unionists leftthis country on the 31st, Jnnuiry 1918 to visit U. S. A, in response to *n invitation from kt\ Snmuel Gompers, Presidents of the American Federation of Labour.     The mission returned e*rly in April, shortly after the *rriv^l in this country of c&apos;n American Mission, which       largely, hut not wholly, m*de up of Labour men nnd women.   The Litter mission returned to Algeria7&apos; on the 22nd. &amp;iy,I have received detailed reports of both missions, but I do not think it necessary to do more th*n indicate the chief points to which attention is dr^wn in those reports.2. It is rrnde perfectly cle^r, both by the Labour men whovisited America ^nd by the Americans who recently visited this country, th^t America is wholehearted in her efforts to win the war.   Statements such ss &quot;America is in this w*r to the l^st man *&quot;nd the lost cent&quot; h/*ve been repeated over ^nd over i^nin in both countries.    The wily indication of *ny lukewArmness comes from the Eastern states of America, where the -^lien popu-lotion ( including Germans) is considerable.3. Industrially, the position in America may develop well or illOn the one h^nd tremendous efforts h&quot;*ve been, ami ere being m*de. $specially as re^rds shipbuilding;   one member of the Labour mission frSifl this country even eoes so for *s to s*y th*t he is gravely apprehensive as to American competition in the shipyards wfter the w*r.   On the other h*nd, these ^forts,- ...       mey At any time be p^r^lysed by the sudden outbreak of serious trade disputes It is to be remembered tftAt the relations existing between employers ^nd employed in America have at times in the past been so bitter thet strikes in that country have been nccempan-ied by riots and sabotage.   The Labour mission reported that
the arbitration machinery which has recently been set up is satisfactory, but suffers from the defect that it is on an optional basis, and may therefore prove inoperative. There is no provis? such as it contained in the Munitions of War Act 1915, for compulsory reference of differences to arbitration.

4. The reports indicate another handicap from which the Americ? war effort is suffering, namely, difficulties of internal and external transport. Our main aim in this country has been to increase industrial production; in America serious problem has arisen through, the difficulties of transporting goods produced.

5. Various suggestions are made in the reports for the further development of propaganda by means of missions and these suggestions have been communicated to Lord Reading, who, however, is averse to the systematic despatch of commercial missions to Ame? on the ground that such missions may give rise to the feeling t? they are sent with ?n eye to our post-war commercial position. On the other hand, he takes the view that deputations of worker? are useful, if they are few and quite reliable. On ft consider? scale he would deprecate them, as a mistake by one man may cause more mischief than is compensated by correct conduct on the part of a hundred; and opportunities for mistakes are plentiful.

6. I should be inclined to suggest that small labour mission should be sent out systematically from this country to America. Those missions should consist of not more than four (and prefera? only of two) members whose names should be communicated to Lord Beading well in advance of their departure, so as to give him ? opportunity of consulting with the administration and with Mr.Gompers.

Subject to proper safeguards, I think such mission? might do very valuable work, by uniting the working classes of this country and America in their efforts to win the War.
