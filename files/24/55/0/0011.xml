United Kingdom Ports and France.The Director was commissioned to visit London where in conference with officials of the War Office and Admiralty an agree-ment was reached under which the Admiralty engaged to supply the necessary transports *   Accordingly in March 1915 vessels were cher-tered and placed in service as Admiralty Transports for the carriage of War Supplies to the United Kingdfcm and France.Later Transports specially allocated for the conveyance of timber to the United Kingdom and France were similarly placed under the Overseas Transport Department.In February 1917 the Ministry of Shipping - owing to increased shortage in ocean tonnage - requisitioned 55$ of the space in all liner vessels trading from Canadian to United Kingdom ports.   On the 1st March requisitioned apace was increased to 75$; on the 1st April to 85$, and on the 1st May the entire cargo space of vessels was taken.Concurrently the Director was advised by the British Ministry of Shipping that the space so requisitioned was restricted to the transportation of foodstuffs and other articles absolutely essential for the maintenance of the civil population of the United Kingdom and the prosecution of the war..In July 1917 the demand for fuol oil for the Allied Fleets, and the shortage of tanker tonnage, made it necessary for the Admiralty to utilize the double bottoms and/or deep tanks of all suitable Liner and Cargo Vessels for the carriage of fuel oil from the United States and Canada overseas.A Department was organised to carry out ihis work which involved structural alterations and repairs to tanks in ships, the fitting of delivery and discharge connections,, pumps, etc.   A Marine Engineer and Surveyor was appointed to supervise the work under instructions of the Overseas Transport Department.
1 j1 iIn conjunction with the British Ministry of Shipping, New York, arrangements w^ere made with the Shell Company of Canada, Ltd. and the Imperial Oil Co. Ltd., for a supply of oil at Mont-real.   This involved an extraordinary rail movement in tank^ars from Texas, Oklahoma, and other South Western States, the American Railways permitting their equipment to be used for this purpose on the understanding that It would get special passenger train service in both directions.   By this means in the month of October 1917 alone the Overseas Transport Department handled no less than five hundred carloads of- oil.^After tho close of Montreal arrangements were concluded to continueynandling of fuel oil at Halifax, and for that purpose tankage was leased from the Imperial Oil Limited, Dartmouth.   The oil was brought up in tank&quot;steamers from Texas, and was delivered through the oil Companyfs tanks and pipe line, as well as by special barge, to vessels at Halifax as required.The work at Halifax was extremely arduous, due to the severe winter weather, with constant snowstorms and sub-zero temperatures, resulting in freezing of pipes and other serious difficulties.The following is a summary of fuel oil shipments *,overseas,-Montreal to close navigation 1917,       67,883 gross tons.Halifax Season 1917-18Double bottoms,      56,109 Fuel tankercargoes. 93,244    149,353 gross tons,TOTAL. Montreal &amp; Halifax, 217,236 gross tonsThe buhkering of transports, more particularly during the summer months, is done in Canada under the direction and supers vision of the Director, as is also the drydocklng of vessels, when necessary.The following statistics are interesting,-CLEARANCES OP MATERIAL &amp; SUPPLIES IN GROSS TONS.(EXCLUSIVE OF HORSES &amp; MULES) FROM AUGUST 1914 to APRIL 1918 INCLUSIVE.MONTH	1914	1915	1916	1917	1918January		28,000	95,642	178,060	339,198February		23,246	131,577	211,505	278,419March		28,703	172,917	266,750	400,323April		35,307	176,894	327,361	406,836May		40,431	164,906	444,970	June		39,079	201,011	534,623	July		46,411	203,010	405,766	August	10,000	58.544	220,439	457,466	Sept.	25,000	69,891	206,194	319,837	oot.	30,000	70,037	169,185	264,979	Nov.	32;500	107,370	203,700	.   370,687	Dec.	40,000	98,903	185,968	209,648	TOTAL	137,500	645,922	2,131,443	3,991,672	1,424,776		GRAND	TOTAL -		8,331,313
1* AProm the foregoing statistics it will bo notiood that the growth of the tonnage has been phenomenal.    The Director controls today practically the export trade of Canadak inland and overseas.The volume of tonnage cleared from the seaboard has been facilitated and delays minimized from the fact that the Canadian pacific and Grand Trunk Railways - recognizing the growth of the transport service-considered concentration of authority necessary to efficient direction and accordingly issued instructions to their Operating Officials that the regulation and control inland of Imperial Material and Supplies should be vested in the Director Overseas Trans-port.     Instructions were accordingly issued that all supplies consigned to his Order should bo given priority of movement on the Railways over all traffic excepting passenger.     In consequence of this and notwith-standing the volume of tonnage effected transports have not been held for cargoes, nor has there been congestion at the Canadian seaboard, nor has any demurrage been paid to either Railway or Inland navigation CompaniesThe advantage arising from the arrangement with the Canadian Pacific Hallway Company has boon great;   not only were the services of the Director and his Chief Assistants placed at tho disposal of the Government, but all the Agencies of the Company from Vancouver to St. John, including Agencies in the United States were under control of the Director and available at all times, and this factor had much to do with the efficiency of the work of the overseas Transport Depart-mont.Montreal.May 8th, 1918.
