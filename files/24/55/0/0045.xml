jEgjate; LJocument is the Property of Eis Britannic Majessy&apos;s Government] A .CONFIDENTIAL. Political Intelligence Department,Foreign Office.[June 19, 1918.]Finland /003.MEMORANDUMonTHE POLITICAL SITUATION IN FINLAND.(A.) Conclusions and Suggestions. (The general basis for these comments will be found in the subsequent Sections.)IT cannot be kept too clearly iu mind that the whole orientation of Finnish foreign politics is primarily determined by fear and hatred of Russia. As a result of decades of oppression any fate seems preferable to the possibility of again coming in any way under her control. It is a natural British tendency to associate the thought of Finland with that of Russia, which is the last thing that the Finnish people want us to do. They recollect the intensified Russification that characterised the opening1 years of the war. They know that Russia will probably recover more quickly from the effects of the war than most of the other belligerents, as she is not so delicately and highly orgauised a social and economic organism as the other countries, and they fear that she will attempt to reconquer them. The Finnish position may be indefensible from the point of view of international law, but it represents a fundamental human fact. One result has been that she has flung herself into the arms of a deliverer and protector whose methods may be different from, but whose basal attitude is not dissimilar to, that of Russia under the old regime (Section (B)). Our business is to turn to best advantage the gradual process of disillusionment, and in any case gratitude has too often proved to be a sentiment of little durability in politics.The German efforts along the line of military assistance, aid in territorial negotia-tions, and food supply are directed towards making the Finnish people believe that in future their independence and political interests can best be safeguarded through a very close political and economic union with Germany. The Germans are also emphasising the inwardness, as they conceive it, of the recent Red uprising^ The attempt at the establishment of the Monarchy as the seal on all these efforts has already divided the country, the Ltepublican north and east, dominated by the Agrarians, Socialists, and a majority of Young Firms, finding itself opposed to the south where the Swedish and Old Finnish parties, together with a certain following amongst Young Finns, favour a Monarchy (Section (C)). A further cleft will be driven in the nation as the real meaning of the commercial treaty, giving Germany practically economic control of the country, is more and more appreciated. It has just been ratified by the Diet for a period of two years. Is it not possible to begin to get into touch with the pro-Ally members of the Agrarian, Young Finn, and Socialist parties to begin with from the two first named the bulk of the army is drawn as also with the anti-German elements in the commercial community, and perhaps show our goodwill in some practical form, as by the distribution of food on the plan of a Finnish Food Relief Committee under Ally officials in the north of the country, which suffers most and is most opposed to the German influence ? The food question is vital, and Germany is doing her best to meet it, having agreed to import a thousand tons of grain and seven hundred tons of salted vegetables by the end of June in return for other commodities. The grain import of a thousand tons, however, is not a hundredth part of the quantity required to make up the deficit between now and next harvest. It could be clearly intimated that more food would be forthcoming as Finland returned to real neutrality. The practical issue would then lie between being hungry and pro-German, or fed and anti-German.Then, again, there is a number of men of Finnish extraction serving in the British army in France. Some of them are now in hospital in England. Is it not possible to make use of some of these (as also of reliable Finns from the United States and Canada) and send them to Finland to make anti-German propaganda, and indicate that neither is Great Britain herself starving and so unable to send food to Finland, nor is France[367-22] B
being defeated in the war ? They could also tell how the Germans fought, and for what the Allies are fighting.The crux of the whole matter is, however, the recognition of Finnish independence. Notwithstanding the statements below (Section (E)), certain cardinal facts remain, as, for example, that the Finns have evidently misunderstood the opening paragraphs in the British Declaration; that whatever their goodwill apart from the small clique that is more German than Finnish they are actually at present powerless to assert the independence we desire to see ; and that it is entirely in the German interests that we should he unrepresented in Finland, and they have the field to themselves. The Finns have only recently announced their independence; they have no experience of foreign politics; they are very ignorant, and.seek advice in quarters whose whole interest is to use them and to. keep them and us apart (Section (D)). Is it impossible to devise some method renewing the offer of recognition with the condition that of absolute neutrality and the test that of goodwill ? If it were possible to devise some communication which would both recognise that which the Finnish Government have done towards meeting us and that which they apparently have been unable to do and the reason for it, and further make our recognition of their independence in turn dependent on absolute neutrality, we should be in a position to have our Charge d&apos;Affaires in Finland, whose advice would be at any rate listened to, and. who would have his share first in assisting the Finns to maintain their neutrality, and latterly in winning them to a more anti-German attitude. Further, we should make it clear that we shall be unsympathetic henceforth to any attempt at the economic or material subjugation of Finland by any Power whatever, provided she duly observes her international obligations. In this &quot;way we would relieve, the Finns of their Kussian fears.One other counter-move is the development of the idea of a confederation of the Baltic States. This would eventually form an alternative for Finland as a guarantee of protection against any Eussian peril in place of union with Germany eventually, for at present the reception of Finland into such .a union would not be countenanced. Never-theless, a confederation of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and Esthonia is a more * natural union than any alliance between Germany and Finland, and Nature has a way of asserting herself. It is not inconceivable that Poland and Lithuania-Livonia might further enter such a league.In Finland there has always existed an intense admiration for British ideals and ii.H;i.t Even to-day there exists a preference for British methods of business as-compared with German. The provisional recognition of the Esthonian National Council; has furnished the Finns with a concrete proof of British fidelity to her traditional policy with regard to small nationalities, and it can only be a question of time until the Finns recognise further* the truth of their own proverb : &quot; In the end one knows who the best friend was.&quot;   Only we should anticipate their realisation and be prepared.(B.) General Situation.Since the issue of Report /001 the Finnish situation has crystallized in a more definite fashion. At that time it seemed probable that with the German assistance the White Guards would be victorious over the Red. The subsequent period has been characterised not merely by the final triumph of the Whites, but bv their marked compliance in turn with German dictation. The result has been that Finnish afiairs, from being a comparatively side issue in the war, have grown into a question of I first-rate importance, largely because of their bearing on the fate of the Baltic and northern Europe generally. If a Greater Finland becomes a permanent vassal of Germany, not merely is Russia cut off from western Europe along her north-western frontier, wherever that may eventually run, but the position of the other Scandinavian countries is threatened in a very direct manner. For many years previous to the war the Germans had devoted considerable attention to the country, and had even published two good practical Finnish grammars as an aid to the study of conditions there. According to an article in the &quot; Deutsche Politik,&quot; 15th March, 1918, Finnish exports to Germany, consisting chiefly of timber, manufactured articles in wood, and butter, rose from 26,000,000 to 45,000,000 marks during the period 1910-1913. On the other hand, German exports to Finland rose from 74,000,000 to 97,000,000 marks in the same period. Indeed, after Russia, Germany took the principal part-in Finnish trade, and even passed Russia in the matter of direct exports to Finland.The Germans entered Helsingfors on the 12th April, and from that date began to take a very definite hand in the control of Finnish affairs, proceeding immediately with the reorganisation of the army, which involved the granting of numerous commissions
and the assignment of important posts to rankers of the Finnish Jiiger Corps who had been trained in Germany. The movement along this particular line culminated in the resignation of General Mannerheim as the result of persistent intriguing against him on the ground of his patriotic and anti-German attitude. His resignation was followed by that of numerous Finnish generals and colonels. The Germans also commenced to buy up various commodities, such as metals, soap, pepper, &amp;c, and lost no time in sending these out of the country. By the I 5th May most of the military stores left by the Russians had already been sent to Germany. Further demands were made, as, for example, for permission to bay 2,000 horses. Latterly the Germans have been extending their efforts in the direction of buying up shares in Finnish banks and companies. Seizure of the telegraphic station, and the issue to the local press of threats of suppression should they publish articles critical of or hostile to the German occupation further aided the process of the control and formation of public opinion. The clearest evidence of the direction in which affairs were moving was afforded, however, by I he changes in the personnel of the Government intimated on the 27th May whereby M. Passikivi, late Senator, became Vice-President and Minister of the Interior, Senator Stenruth became Foreign Minister, Colonel TheslofF became Minister of War, and M. Paloheimo, Food Dictator. M. Sario remained as Secretary of State with a portfolio. Previously (18th May) President Svinhufvud had been invested with practically dictatorial powers. All these are pronounced Monarchists. Again, a suggestion that Finnish Red Guard prisoners should be deported to Germany for employment in agricultural and industrial work appeared a desirable solution of a difficult problem for Finnish Whites and Germans alike, though it is still uncertain whether the suggestion has been acted upon and on what scale. Such complete and sudden subserviency on the part of one of the most democratic peoples in the world is somewhat remarkable. In part it is an expression of gratitude for assistance in the suppression of a peculiarly brutal civil war; in part an indication of an expectation of further assistance in the creation of a Greater Finland ; in part also it is the simple recognition of a situation out of which for the time being no other way of escape seems open. The final stage in the process of the . assertion of German supremacy is the proposed introduction of the monarchical system.(C.) Monarchy versus Republic Controversy.If one were to ask a typical member of the Old Finnish party to-day why he favours the introduction of a Monarchy, he would probably reply : &quot; In the first place, we must make certain that there will never be a repetition of this Red uprising, and that can best be secured under a Monarchy. In the second place, Republicanism is not adapted to a little country like Finland. Party politics are the subject of very keen and often bitter conflict with us, and in small countries the recurring Presidential contest would have more disquieting effects upon the life of the community than it does in a larger country. We should be saved from this recurring upheaval under a Monarchy. In the third place, it is certain that after the war there will be an even greater tendency towards the grouping of Powers than previously. Very few States in the world are really independent, and the smaller nations are compelled to come into close relationship with the larger. For us the choice of protector lay between Germany and Russia; of the two we prefer Germany, but then Germany is not disposed to an alliance with a republic. Therefore it is better for us that we should become a Constitutional Monarchy.&quot;Of the total Finnish population of 3j millions, only some 450,000 live in the towns, and over one-third of these are to be found in Helsingfors. Accordingly, any events that may come about in the capital can hardly be taken as representative of the state of feeling in the country, although just because Helsingfors is the one intellectual centre in Finland, it has hitherto tended to arrogate to itself the whole direction of affairs. In this way it becomes possible for a comparatively small group of individuals supported by German troops to carry out changes about which there is as yet no unequivocal evidence that they commend themselves, to the mass or&quot; the Finnish people. With regard to the state of feeling upon this particular question reference may be made to an interview with the chief editor of the principal Young Finnish paper in Helsingfors, which was quoted in a Stockholm paper (&apos; ,Stockholms Dagblad&quot;) of the 13th May. M. Erkko there maintains that whilst the leading Helsingfors organ of the Old Finnish party is Monarchist in tone, most of the provincial papers of that party are Republican, as are also the papers of the Agrarian party; on the other hand, only a few of the provincial papers of the Swedish party stand for the Monarchy. In Helsingfors, however, the Old Finnish and Swedish papers are extremely Monarchist.
Nevertheless, M. Erkko maintains that, so far as he knows, an absolute majority of the Finnish people, with the exception of the inhabitants of Helsingfors, are opposed to the idea of a Monarchy, so that with the inclusion o! the Socialists it is certain ihat the Republican form of government is secure unless in the event of a coup d&apos;Etat. Out of the 200 members of the Finnish Diet 70 are proscribed for the moment&apos; as members of the Socialist party that brought on the recent civil war. Of the remaining 130 half, roughly, are Monarchists and the other half Republican. Accordingly, even in the present reduced Diet the Monarchists cannot legally obtain the two-thirds majority which is necessary in connection with any change affecting the Finnish constitution ; still less have they any chance of obtaining the further five-sixths majority which is required for making any immediate change, in default of which the question would then become a leading one at the next general election. One result of the German manipulation of the present Government, which includes only three Republicans, is to drive the Young Finnish party and the Agrarians into closer co-operation with the moderate Socialists. The Young Finns have also stated that they are determined not to consent to the establishment of two Chambers, nor to agree to any restriction of the present universal suffrage.In the &quot; Hufvudsblaclet&quot; of the 30th May a pro-Republican manifesto was published, drawn up by leading members principally of the Young Finnish and Agrarian parties, and signed by over seventy representative members of these parties and a few members of other parties who are even known to be pro-German in their sympathies. The gist of the statement is to the following effect: &quot;We are making a new start in the political and social life of our country, and the question before us is whether that shall be under a Monarchical or Republican scheme of government.   Here in the capital the majority of the people seem to be Monarchists; in the country districts, on the other hand, there is strong opposition to the proposed abandonment of Republicanism.   Why do we prefer the Republican form of administration ?   Finland has been a Monarchy for centuries, &apos; but only nominally so, because we have never had in our country either Royal Family or Court.    Accordingly at the present time the establishment and splendours of a Court can no longer dazzle us.   We have to settle this question on the basis of real facts.   We want a strong Government, but the power cannot be handed over to any King comiug from a foreign country and to his successors. We shall obtain a sense of security far more if we hand over the supreme power to a Finnish-born President elected by the people.   Under such conditions the sense of responsibility will be more keen than if we had a foreign ruler.   Contrary to what is commonly asserted to-day, the President will be able to unite the people better than a foreign King relying on a narrow clique in politics.   On the other baud, if the King is to be given so little authority that he is merely a decoration, then from the point of view of the interests of the whole country and the people, he is really a superfluity.   It has also been stated that our foreign political relationships demand a Monarchical constitution.   It has been maintained that Finland in order to defend her independence must rely on the help of a mighty Germany, and that therefore it would be advisable to strengthen these bonds through the establishment of a German throne in Finland.   We quite agree that in the present circumstances we want close relations with Germany, but leading German statesmeh have assured us that Germany will never mix herself in Finnish internal politics, and accordingly we believe that Germany will secure a far better ally if the Finnish constitution corresponds to natural conditions and is supported by the national feeling than if our own people are weighed down with a constitution which does not correspond to their political consciousness.   We refuse to believe that Germany, through a German-born King, would wish to lower us to the position of a non-sovereign vassal, and therefore we say that according to our firm conviction from every point of view our future will be far better safeguarded through a Republican constitution than through the experiment of establishing a foreign Monarchy in Finland..  Until last April the final establishment of a Republic seemed to be absolutely secure.   The later proposal of the establishment of a Monarchy will postpone the settlement of the new constitution for an indefinite period.   This danger can be averted only by means of accepting the earlier proposal of a Republic.&quot;Further, in the &quot; Times&quot; of the 13th June the following were given as the principal provisions in the Bill for the new constitution as presented to the Diet on the 11th June : 
f* Finland is a free, indivisible, constitutional monarchy under an hereditary sovereign of the Evangelical faith, the Monarch and Grown &quot;Prince to attain their majority at the age of 18.&quot;The ICing is to decide Finland&apos;s policy towards foreign Powers, but any treaties concluded must, unless the Constitution otherwise provide, be ratified by the Diet. The King cannot commence an offensive war without the Diefs consent.&quot; Executive power belongs to the King, the legislative power to the King and the Riksdag together, the judicial power to independent law courts.&quot; The King cannot also be the sovereign of another State. He must choose as members of the State Council native citizens of Finland known for their integrity and capacity in administration.&quot; Before the law courts the Swedish and Finnish languages may be equally used, and the State is to provide equally for the educational requirements of the Swedish and Finnish populations.&quot; The Riksdag represents the people of Finland.&quot; The King has an absolute veto on all legislation. Acts affecting the fun-damental law, the organisation of the army and navy, and any other law to which the sovereign has opposed his veto will become law, notwithstanding if approved by the Riksdag after new elections by a majority of at least two-thirds of the members voting.&quot;Administrative districts are to be divided as far as possible according as the inhabitants speak Swedish and Finnish.&quot;Until the law otherwise provides foreigners may be employed in the military service.&quot;The latest telegrams indicate that the Government had not secured the necessary majority and were deliberating on what further action to take.(D.) The Question of a Greater Finland.In report /001 some notes were given on the Finnish point of view with regard to Russian Karelia, based on conversations with Dr. Holsti. These may now be replaced by the following more authoritative communication presented to His Ma]esty&apos;s Government by Dr. Holsti in the name of the Finnish Government: &quot; The Finnish Government have been most cautious in their relation to the strong political movement prevalent among the Finnish-speaking part of the population in the Russian Governments, Olonets (Aunus) and Archangelsk (Vienan Karjala), i.e., Russian Karelia, though on the other hand the Finnish nation entertain a most sincere hope that the parts of Russian Karelia inhabited by their kinsmen would be united to the Finnish Republic.&quot; As far as all the facts indicate and prove, the aforesaid aspirations both among the Russian Karelians and the Finns are actually and have always J)een national. Thus they have never been fostered and supported by the Finns and the inhabitants of Russian Karelia for the sake of promoting German military aims relative to the Murman Railway and the coast of the Arctic Ocean. It has been only during the two or three last months that they haye seen their dreams of centuries mentioned in foreign newspapers in connection with any such German efforts.&quot; The attitude and policy of the Finnish Government is largely influenced by the following facts : &quot; 1. From the strategical, ethnographical, geographical, and economic points of view the present frontier between Finland and Russia is untenable. In case the future of Russian Karelia should not be solved in accordance with racial demands and rights, a strong Fennia Irredenta movement could not be avoided and thereby a source of permanent disharmony between Finland and Russia would arise. If/-on the other hand, the Great Powers could see their way to allow the aforesaid national question to be settled in conformity with the right of self-determination, the chief source of constant ill-feeling between Finland and Russia would certainly be abolished. By suck a solution the frontier would be made natural from the racial point of view, and strategically also fully acceptable.[367-22] &quot; C
G&quot; 2. If, in addition, proper attention is to be paid to the geographical and economic conditions, it is to be borne in mind that the greatest wealth of Finland lies in her forests. A considerable part of them have actually a comparatively low value since Finland has no access to the coast of the White Sea, to which several Finnish rivers have their outlet, nor Jhas Finland as yet any ports on the coast of the Ocean, though that has been a natural aspiration and a just claim Arctic for the last sixty years. In the &apos; sixties&apos; the Russian Emperor, Alexander II, united a portion of South-Eastern Finland to Russia, and territorial compensation was promised. Subsequently the Finnish authorities asked for compensation in the Russian Kola Peninsula; through such an agreement Finland was to obtain direct access to the coast of the Arctic Ocean. The same claim was repeated by the Finnish Diet during the first years of the reign of his successor, Alexander III (1882), but no answer was given.&quot; As soon, therefore, as the Russian revolution broke out in March 1917 and legal order was restored in Finland, the new Finnish Government took up the claim and a report was drawn up, according to which Russia was to be asked anew to cede to Finland the aforesaid part of her north-western territory. This demand had become lately the more natural as the Imperial Russian Government, without asking for the consent of the Finnish Diet, had spent several millions of Finnish State funds to construct a main road from the northern terminus of the Finnish State Railways, through Finnish Lapland to Petchenga, on the coast of the Arctic Ocean. The Finnish Government were the more confident regarding such a settlement as direct support from the British and French Governments was reckoned upon. The said road has been constructed mainly for the sake of Great Britain and her Allies, and they had also availed themselves of it more than any-body else. Besides, it was expected that it would lie in the interests of Great Britain and France to open facilities for transportation of the immense wealth of the Finnish Crown forests to the most accessible ports. The exceptionally great demand of wood products after the war had constantly been foretold in British commercial periodicals; several times they had also directly suggested that the Western Allies should secure immediately for their own disposal all the supplies of wood Finland could export. Finally, the Finnish Government entertained a firm hope that, owing to the heavy financial burden which fell to Finland during the war through her great military contributions to Russia, Great Britain and France, Finland&apos;s chief creditors, would gladly see the state of her finance improved by means of a wise use of the Crown forests in Northern Finland.&quot; The collapse of Russia, the proclamation of the independence of the Finnish Republic, the unfortunate outbreak of civil war in Finland, and subsequently the German military intervention, seem greatly to have complicated the solution of the questions regarding the future of Russian Karelia and the access of Finland to the coast of the Kola Peninsula. It is true that through a special treaty signed by the Council of the Commissaries of the Russian People and the Finnish Revolutionary Government, Russia ceded to Finland a considerable part of Russian Karelia and a large portion of the coast of the Kola Peninsula. - The arrangement was dictated by a sincere desire to abolish all possibilities for future strife between the neighbouring States. There is also sufficient reason to believe that the Imperial German Government do not entertain any far-reaching intentions to obtain direct tooting on the coast of the Arctic Ocean. Having concluded peace with Russia, Germany is hardly likely to take any steps which might provoke, a new state of war between Russia and the Central Empires.&quot; The Finnish Government fully understand the necessity of solving the questions of the future of Russian Karelia and the access of Finland to the Arctic Ocean by an amicable arrangement with all the Powers concerned.&quot; If a considerable part of the Murman Railway is to come within Finnish territory, it would appear as if Great Britain and her Allies would lose the direct connection with Russia, which is a vital necessity for them. It must, however, be observed that the above railway cannot be used merely for the benefit of Great Britain and her Allies, but just as easily, dependent on circumstances, against them. If, therefore, after the General Peace Conference the Finnish parts of Russian Karelia would be united to Finland, and at the same time the Finnish Government would agree to the Murman Railway coming under international
control, the interests of Eussia, Great Britain, and her Allies would be safeguarded, and in case of war the said railway could not be used against them. Regarding arrangements for the duration of the present war, the Finnish Government are undoubtedly prepared to negotiate in order not to jeopardise a satisfactory solution on the conclusion of peace. On the other hand, the Finnish Government consider that the settlement of their claim to that part of the coast of the Arctic Ocean not touched by the Murman Railway (Petchenga) should not be any longer delayed.&quot; In conclusion it may be pointed out that, through Finland&apos;s access to the Arctic coast, Great Britain will be in a position to enter into direct communication with Finland and thereby with the.Baltic Sea, which would thus not be likely to become a German mare clausum.&apos;; London, May 28, 191.8.&quot;The first practical step in connection with the realisation of these aspirations was announced in the following wireless sent the 26th May to the Russian Plenipotentiary Joffe, in Berlin (&quot; Daily Review,&quot; the 28th May, 1918) :-&quot; Count Mirbach proposed in the name of his Government a basis for peace with Finland: &quot; Finland is to cede Ino and Raivola. We are to undertake not to fortify these places, and to cede to Finland a strip of the Murman region with an outlet to the sea.&quot; The Russian Government accept this offer.....-Ohtcherin.&quot;The interpretation of the above exchange, in connection with which Germany appears to have played an important mediating role, is open to considerable ambiguity. Dr. Holsti is of opinion that the strip referred to is intended (roughly) to include the Petchenga Fiord on the actual coast, and the territory contained within that coastal line as base and a line running parallel to the present Russo-Norwegian frontier to begin with, but latterly moving south-east, till it reaches the present Finno-Russian frontier/&apos;&apos; If he is right, this is a comparatively moderate demand aiming solely at an ice-free port on the Murman coast, and representing, in addition to the terms of the present exchange the hitherto unfulfilled promise of compensation for the territory of Rajajoki, which the Russians got in 1863. Dr. Holsti&apos;s opinion is that the larger question of Russian Karelia ought to be decided at a later date on the principle of self-determination, with possible internationalisation of the Murruan Railway. It should, however, be borne in mind that the Norwegian Government also apparently has a claim to all the coast of the Kola Peninsula.From the middle of April onwards telegraphic reports have been received indicating the presence of-. Finnish White Guards at various points in Russian Karelia, and even of collisions between them and detachments of the Russian lied Army. The Finnish flag appears to have been definitely hoisted at Boris Gleb on a southern inlet of the Varanger Fiord on the 9th May. All this activity could quite well be in keeping with such an interpretation of events as that given by Dr. Holsti, and may be considered as a legitimate consequence of the cession of territory in that region by the Russian Bolshevik Government to the Finnish Red Government early in March. On the other hand, the growing telegraphic references to movements of German detachments to the north and east suggest in the w^ords of one of the Germau soldiers in Finland that, although he did not know why he was there, there was &quot; was hinter.&quot;(e.) Relations of His Majesty&apos;s Government with Finland.On the 19th April Sir Esme Howard made a verbal communication to the Finnish Charge&apos;d&apos;Affaires at Stockholm in the following sense : His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to recognise provisionally the de facto Finnish Government pending the final settlement at the Peace Conference in accordance with the principle of self-determination, if the Finnish Government (1) can obtain the release of British subjects arrested by the Germans on Finnish territory, (2) and will give the necessary guarantees for the maintenance of neutrality, especially as regards security of Allied subjects and property, particularly ships, the passage of British subjects and goods through Finland to Russia when communications are reopened, and* According- to Dr. Ilolsti there were three definite proposals of frontier rectification.
the passage of Allied ships through Finnish territorial waters. When, the first question is settled and satisfactory guarantees have been given, His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to accredit a Charge d&apos;Affaires to the Finnish Government.The answer to the above offer, which was issued as a communique to the press by the Finnish Government, before it &quot;was received by any representative of, His Majesty&apos;s Government, was to the following effect: &quot; In reply to the communication made by the British Consul regarding the conditions on which Great Britain would acknowledge Finnish independence, although such acknowledgment would be of great value, there can be for us no question of Finland, whose national independence has already been acknowledged legally and practically by several Powers without any conditions whatsoever, being now willing to submit the question of her independence dio&apos; any congress. Concerning Great Britctin&apos;s demands, it must be recalled that the Finnish Govern-ment has already on a previous occasion taken steps for setting free English and other Entente subjects imprisoned by the German military authorities in Finland, although Great Britain, who has not recognised Finland&apos;s national independence, has no legal ground for such a demand. The questions of free passage by land and sea are raised too soon, since it is evident that international conditions of land and sea trade will for some time be such that exact regulations and control will be unavoidable ; in such measure as conditions again become normal, hindrances for free traffic will automatically disappear.&quot; (&quot;Daily Beview,&quot; 18th May, 1918.)Much of the above is helpless evasion. The British Government had not proposed that the question of Finnish independence should be submitted to the Peace Conference, but had merely stated that they would recognise independence provisionally pending that Conference, feeling that all the questions which had arisen out of the war would then implicitly or explicitly receive definite settlement. It is also apparent that the assertion that His Majesty&apos;s Government had no right to demand the release of British subjects taken in Finland because they had not recognised Finnish independence, indicates a certain obtuseness of mentality, inasmuch as a country could hardly be recognised as independent if a loreign Power could without hindrance arrest subjects of another nation on its territory. The breaking of the British consular seals by the Germans, in spite of the Finnish guarantee of the inviolability of the Allied diplomatic and consular staffs, was a peculiarly aggravated affront at once to Finland and Great Britain. Again, as regards the question of control of passengers and transit traffic, the Finnish Government was assured through Sir Esme Howard that His Majesty&apos;s Government would admit the right of the Finnish Government to make the necessary regulations on that point. &quot; We had, for instance, never disputed the right of the Swedish Government to prohibit the transit of arms and ammunition, and we should certainly ask for the same right of transit both for persons and for goods as were accorded to other States.&quot; In short, the British conditional offer of recognition of official independence has had, at any rate, the satisfactory result of bringing out quite clearly the fact that at the moment no real Finnish independence exists to be recognised.June .1.7, 1918.
