(.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BTOMHIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENTS.)239S X C R 3 T. WAR CABINET.G.T, 4975.RELEASE OF AGRICULTURAL LABOUR FOR MILITARY SERVICE.Memorandum by the Secretary for Sootland. Circulated^vith reference to War&quot;Cabinet 4&quot;3oT Minute 14,(Previous papers: G.T.4922 and G.T.49!?3.)I understand that the question of a reduction of the ,.* quota of men to be takan from Agriculture was discussed by the War Cabinet yesterday, and that a decision was reached to suspend the calling up of any more men in England and Wales.   Presumably through some misunderstanding, I was not summoned to the meeting.The quota for Scotland (5,!?00) was fixed on a proportion-ate basis with relation to the quota for England and Wales (30,000).   It was agreed to by me with appreciation of the seriousness of the military situation, but with grave apprehen-sions as to the effect on food production.    Those apprehensions have been accentuated during the process of endeavouring to seleet men to fill the quota,    Every effort has been made to take the men whose release would cause least disturbance.   But the Board of Agriculture for Scotland have found it necessary to release large numbers of skilled men, and they have received hundreds of communications protesting that &quot;key men&quot; are being called up.     Similar protests have been made directly to me, and I understand that a mass protest meeting of farmers was being held in Edinburgh yesterday.   Numerous questions are being nut in the House of Commons, and I am being strongly pressed to receive deputations.In short, a critical position has been reached in Scotland, as in England and Wales, and similar remedial measures are called for.I submit&apos;, therefore, to   the War Cabinet that the quota now to be taken from Agriculture in Scotland should be diminished in proportion to the redustion mado for England and Wales, which is, I understand, about one-fifth of tho total.     If, owing to greater celerity in tho work of calling up, a larger proportion of men has already been called up in Scotland, I submit that tho men should be restored from the Army to the farms in Scotland to the extent necessary to secure equivalent treatment of tho two countries.The retention of this fraction of the quota ie most important for the purposes of the coming harvest.   It will, however, only partially meet the situation.   When the withdrawal of men was decided uppn, it was understood that additional supplies of soldier labour would be available for the harvest.   I am advised that, after taking account of all other sources of supply, a great number of soldiers of low grade will be required if the harvest is to be seoured.     I have put in a request to the War Office for the provision of 10,000 additional soldiers for the period beginning about the middle of August,   No official answer has yet been received, bat I am informed by the Ministry of National Service that the War Office see difficulty in making a favourable response.I submit that it iB vital that this reinforcement of labour should be made available.    Otherwise there will be great loss of food supplies, and general oomplaints that the Governments promises have been broken.    As the corn harvest will begin in about six weeks time, the matter is pressing.ROBERT MUNRO.Scottish Office,27th June, 1918.
