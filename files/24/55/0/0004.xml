I18[this Document is the property op his britannic majesty&apos;s government.)My Committee recommended as far back as December 1917 that the Governmont should control the distribution of milk.     They considered that this should be done when there was plenty of milk so as to be ready to moet the more serious times of winter when local shortages wpuld probably again be serious and milk unobtainable in sufficient quantities for children in certain areas whereas adults in other districts might have plenty.This policy was put forward unanimously and reaffirmed subsequently in February,    The Ministry of Food as well as the Boards of Agriculture for England, Scotland and Wales were notified of this recommendation.The Sub-Committee referred to by Mr, Prothero did not advise on polioy.     They were set up to suggest administrative machinery after the policy had been acoopted by Lord Rhondda.     I appointed representatives of the Boards of Agriculture of England and Scotland as well as individual farmers on this Sub-Committee which was unanimous in all its proposals except on the policy of nationalizing the wholesale distribution.The main Committee.endorsed the proposals made by this Sub-Committee for controlling the distribution but stated that they were not prepared to support the policy of nationalization owing to insufficiency of evidenoe as to (1) the needs and effects of such a policy and (2) financial terms.     They recommended that &quot;steps should be taken to determine the basis on which the interests concerned could be aoquired should this be deemed advisable at any time by the Government, and that the Government should also examine the possibility and advisability and also the conditions of compen* sating the interests concerned for any damage done to them by Control without actually purchasing such interests.&quot;As Control will tend to strengthen and appreciate the value of certain trade interests and to create something like/trust, it seems desirable that the Government should examine the following alternative courses:-(1)   To take an option of the businesses concerned on the basis of present values so that the State should get any increase in value due to StatefiCoijitr61.    The State would not be obliged to exercise its option aM^resell at a profit if it did buy as presumably the option would not be enforced if such a course involved a loss to the Exchequer.(2)   To settle general principles for purchasing on a pre war basis as has been done with the Liquor Traffic.(3)   To ask the Ministry of Reconstruction-to examine the policy which the State should adopt to the trade trusts or semi-tructs which will have been oreated during the war frequently as the result of Government aotion.SECRET.war   cabinet.g.t.4904.CONTROL OF MILK DISTRIBUTION.(Memorandum by Major The Hon. W. Astor, M.P.
Meanwhile i should urge the desirability of sotting up as raptf as possible the machinery for controlling the distribution of milk as to be in a position to deal with the inequalities in distribute which wore mainly responsible for the disoontcnt which existed lastl winter.This policy and our recommendations were accepted nem-con. by the Agricultural Advisory Committee to the Ministry of Pood, -(Sgd.)
