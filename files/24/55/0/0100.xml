UonfiaentiaLU, I iTLABOUR POSITION IN MUNITION INDUSTRIES.(26th June 1918.)I circulate the following notes which have been prepared in the Intelligence and Statistics Section of the Ministry of Munitions on the labour position in munition industries.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.I.-STRIKES.Statistics of Strikes. During the week ended the 19th June 1918, 32,780 working days just over one-fifth of 1 per cent, of the possible working time were lost through strikes on Ministry of Munitions work. The greatest loss of time took place at the Gorse Mill and Lilac Mill factories, where 4,000 workpeople were on strike for the whole of the week.Gorse and Lilac Mills Stoppage. The recent stoppage of work on the construction of the Gorse and Lilac Mills, near Oldham, was of an unusual character. It was not a strike to compel a change in existing conditions of employment; it was a protest against a change against the suspension, so far as non-resident workers were concerned, of a bonus of 9s. a week hitherto paid to all alike. The contractor alleged that it was an outworkers&apos; bonus and had been paid to resident workers in error. The men on their side affirmed that it was a timekeeping bonus and should continue to be paid to all. At the Gorse Mill, the bonus was first paid at a time when resident workers constituted a small fraction of the whole number. The small minority received it like the rest, and continued to receive it while their numbers increased until the residents constituted about 50 per cent, of the entire body. At the Lilac Mill, on the other hand, there are prima facie grounds for believing that the bonus has been paid as a timekeeping bonus and has been recognised throughout as such.When payment of the bonus to local workers was suspended, the men turned to the shop stewards, who responded promptly, and cessation of work, involving 4,400 men, took place.A workers&apos; committee claimed that they alone must be recognised as representing the workmen, but representatives of the trade unions involved, including the Electrical Trades Union, were invited to come to the Ministry and explain the position taken up by the men. At that conference, the facts here set forth were ascertained and an important legal question emerged. Had the contract of employment been varied substantially ? If so, men who ceased work on account of the variation in the terms of their engagement were not guilty of a strike. It seemed clear that, owing to the obscurity of the facts and the uncertainty of the legal position, the matter formed a proper subject for arbitration, and that the result of the arbitration might not to be anticipated or pre-judged by any interruption of existing conditions. It was therefore decided that, on resumption of work by the men, payment of the bonus should continue as in the past pending the finding of an independent commissioner appointed by the Ministry of Labour. Simultaneously it was made clear that this action of the Ministry was not in any degree to be interpreted by the men as a decision or concession on the point in dispute-.In agreeing to the restoration of the status quo before resumption of work by the fl      builders, the Ministry were not departing from general principle, since the cessation of work was rather in the nature of a refusal to accept new conditions of employment than an illegal strike.  There was, however, an illegal strike on other grounds of the electricians employed at the Lilac Mill, and in this case the Ministry insisted uponm  (33)6054  Pk 20  125  7/18   B&amp;S
resumption of work before inquiry was made. A claim was advanced that the men should be guaranteed their wages for the time while they were not working, but this was refused by the Ministry, and work was resumed on the 24th June on the Ministry&apos;s conditions.Opposition to Non-Unionists. There are evidences of an increasing tendency on the part of some trade unions to coerce non-unionists to become members. The Electrical Trades Union are particularly active in this respect. At the New System Telephone Company, a non-unionist whom the linn engaged was presented by the shop steward with an ultimatum requiring him to join the Society within a week. Before the week had expired several members of the Union struck and were dismissed. The non-unionist was assaulted by the shop steward, who was convicted of the offence at the Clerkenwell Assizes, and bound over to keep the peace for two years. A similar case occurred at J. B. Marrs, who were engaged on electrical installation work at the N.A.F., Richmond. Here the men brought successful pressure on a non-union foreman to join the Union. The electricians already belonging to the Union had struck as a protest against his non-membership, and prosecution might have been necessary if the foreman had not elected mainly for the sake of sparing his employer inconvenience  to give way. .......At Barrow, the carpenters and joiners refuse to work with a certain workman because he is not a unionist, and refuse to accept him as a member on the ground that he is not sufficiently skilled. So strong and successful has been the pressure applied by the unions that, of the 35,000 workers employed by Messrs. Vickers, only 60 or 70 are non-unionists.Reports of action of this character on the part of trade unions against non-unionists are being received from all parts of the country.IL-MAN POWER AND MUNITIONS.The withdrawal under the decision of the War Cabinet of all Grade I. men born in 1898-1899 will have a serious effect upon some munitions work. Thus, in the Cleveland iron ore mines the consequent loss of iron ore is estimated at 6,000 tons a week. The number of youths affected is only about 250, but they are practically all underground drivers, and all the underground drivers are young men. Their work requires much physical strength and activity, and the men can only be replaced by the more youthful of the miners working at the face. Similarly, Cumberland hematite mines will lose between 250 and 300 youths of these years, with a consequent reduction in this vital ore of some 2,000 tons a week.Some blast furnaces and steel works will also be seriously affected. Some steel mills will probably.have to close and some furnaces will have to shut down, while others, which have been under construction during the last year and were ready, cannot now be started. If a blast furnace is once shut down, it cannot be started again for four or six months, as it has to be practically rebuilt.Individual firms engaged on more finished products will also be seriously affected. Thus, one firm making crank shafts for an urgently needed type of aeroplane engine had eight men employed upon an essential and most highly skilled operation. Seven of these eight men were born in 1899, all were classed Grade I., and all have gone. The result is a loss of 25 engines, that is, 25 aeroplanes a week.It is not, of course, possible to give any precise statistical estimate of the general effect upon the output of munitions. Much will depend upon the treatment accorded to claims for indispensable men born in the the years 1895, 1896, 1897. Much also depends upon the precise labour arrangements of individual firms. In some, there will be no loss of output, in others, only a temporary loss, while some may never recover.III.-WOODWORKERS AND PAYMENT BY RESULTS.There is well-defined opposition on the part of the woodworking unions, especially the carpenters and joiners engaged on aircraft, to systems of payment by results. Under the Aircraft Woodworkers&apos; Agreement these unions undertook to acquiesce in existing systems of that kind, though, according to their interpretation of the agreement, they held themselves free to oppose the extension of such systems. Nevertheless, there have been numerous instances where established systems have been obstructed and withstood.   Tins attitude is manifested strongly in a circular
iissued by Mr. Chandler, secretary of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners, on behalf of Mr. A. G. Cameron, secretary of the Aircraft Woodworkers Committee.   It contains the following sentences : &quot; If our members refuse to conform to the plain time work system of payment, they have to be dealt with in accordance with Rule. This irrespective of the number of years they have been members of. our Society.&quot; I may add that we are dealing with three or four districts where some system of payment by results obtains at the present moment. &quot; We are deter-- mined to compel the members to conform to the conditions of employment permitted by our General Rules.&quot;In view of the fact that the supply of planes and aeroplane bodies is at present ahead of the supply of aero-engines, the extension of payment by results to new establishments is perhaps not called for imperatively; but future supplies of engines from America are likely to redress the balance, and the maintenance of existing systems is undoubtedly necessary.The resistance is mainly official. With the rank and file, payment by results is gaining in popularity; not infrequently they accept it in defiance of instructions from their union. There is reason to believe that a secret ballot of the London District Woodworkers has recently been taken on the question, and while the result of the vote has not been disclosed, it is not improbable that the official policy of the unions has received a rebuff at the hands of the members.
