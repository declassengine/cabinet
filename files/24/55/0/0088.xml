Sir Guy Granet cables that lie is discussing with the principal packers in Chicago the question of making some arrangements as to taking back any soft meat at the American port of export at a price as little as possible below the price of fresh meats in the local markets. He points out that with the tempera-tnre usually experienced during the summer months, there is bound to be a certain amount of meat arriving at American ports in slightly soft condition, which can, &quot;however, be frozen into undoubtedly good shipping condition, but which, under these circumstances, becomes subject to the objection that it has suffered a loss of bloom.Sir Guy Granet has been asked to expedite imports of saccharine in order to meet an immediate deficiency in this country.The Lord Mayor has fixed July 23rd for the luncheon in honour of Mr. Hoover, at which the Prime Minister has expressed his intention of being present.Bacon, Hams, and Lard.

The Testing of Seeds Order, 1918, dated. 17th June 1918, widens the scope of last year&apos;s Order, and makes it applicable to all the principal kinds of cereals, grasses, roots, and vegetables. Under the previous Order in the case of wheat, barley, oats, and rye, it was only necessary for the seller to state the name of the variety without any declaration as to germination and purity, but after July 1st, farmers&quot;, when selling seed for sowing, must have it tested, and either state that it is above a certain prescribed standard of germination, or give the actual percentage of germinating seed. The Order also requires that packets of vegetable seeds below a certain weight shall bear a statement that the seed is above or below a prescribed standard of germination.Soft Fruit.

establishments there, and sanction has been obtained for converting these establish-nients into national, kitchens. The necessary arrangements are being made for plant and equipment, and it is expected that the scheme will be complete by the end of July.   The Mayor of Southampton lias written as follows : &quot; I do not know how to express the towifs and my own personal gratitude to you for the prompt and able manner in which you have tackled the very serious state of things in our docks. Since you had the matter in hand, it has moved with wonderful rapidity, and in a few weeks you have settled a. very troublesome matter which has been under consideration for years.&quot;The opening of the new national restaurant in New Bridge Street on Wednesday, 26th June, caused an unexpected revival of the queue habit, as from 11 to 3 there were crowds of customers in the street waiting to obtain admission. The food is clean and good, and the charges are reasonable. 2,000 meals were served on the first day, and the takings were roughly 50L  The initial capital outlay was 2,500LFood Survey Board.The Food Survey Board, which was appointed by the Food Controller in January, has now completed its work.Appropriate scales of rations have been drawn up for all the various public services in which they formerly did not exist. Adjustments have also been made by the departments concerned, on representations from the Board, in existing scales. In future this and the other branches of administration initiated by the Board will be dealt with directly by appropriate sections of the Ministry of Food.Colonel Weigall, as Surveyor of Consumption in Public Services, will deal with (a) Scales of consumption in public services, i.e., navy, army, hospitals, prisons, and generally all institutions for special classes of the population.(6) The control of canteens serving such special classes, whether official, semi-official, or non-official.(c) National salvage so far as it affects the Ministry of Food.(d) Consumption in the public services generally, including the supervision ofthe Avork of the Ships Stores Branch in respect of scales of consumption. Professor Starling will act as Scientific Adviser to the Ministry, in addition to Professor Sir Henry Thompson.Organised Distribution.District Reports. A series of demonstrations in cheese-making recently organised Id Roxburghshire has met with considerable success. The Commissioner for the East of Scotland hopes that the movement will spread and induce small producers to manufacture good cheese in place of indifferent butter.The Commissioner for the West of Scotland reports that the potato crop is good throughout the division, but that there is a lot of wireworm in the oat crop which is normal^ in that district considerably in excess of the wheat crop.The Midland Commissioner records a chorus a praise from the Press on the success achieved by the Ministry of Food during the past 12 months. This testimony is confirmed by the weekly report from the Ministry of Labour.Rationing. On and after 14th July the number of coupons in each week available for the purchase of butchers&apos; meat will revert to three, instead of two.In connection with the issue of the new ration books, spaces have been arranged, (a) for the rationing of tea in districts which desire to continue or begin it; (b) for the rationing of jam under either local or national schemes; and (c) for the rationing of cheese or any other selected article of food. Childrens&apos; coupons will be of the same value as adults&apos; coupons but only half the number of coupons will be given.Enforcement of Orders.-There is again a slight fall in the number of prosecutions this week, there being 41 fewer cases than in the preceding week. The decrease is chiefly due to the small number sent in from Ireland. The Irish returns have consistently decreased for a considerable period and were, less this.week than in any previous week. The total number of prosecutions for the week is 723, with 677 convictions.
The average fine for England and Scotland is 4 . 3s. 8d., and for Ireland, 5s. 9d. The Divisions sending in the largest number of returns are ; Percentage of Cases convicted.Home Counties, 125 -        -        -        -.       - 96North-East, 74..... 82London, 68  -                 -        -        - 95Midland, 62.....- 95North-West, 40 100South-West, 40      -    .   -        -        -        - 97The prosecutions were instituted under 66 Orders, three of which were new to the list :-Tea (Retail Prices) - - - - - 8 cases. Potatoes (Registration of Wholesale Dealers) - 3 cases. Gooseberries -        -        -        -        -        -   2 cases.The largest number of cases was in connection with the Meat Rationing Order No. 417 81 cases, and the Potatoes (Growers&apos; Returns) Order-80 cases. The importance of the prohibition of the sale of new bread is shown in the case of W. Tytler, baker, who was fined bl. in Aberdeen County for three contraventions of the Bread Order, 1917. The police ascertained that customers were refusing to take bread from another baker because he was selling it 12 hours old, and the accused was selling newly-baked bread.The following convictions were obtained during the week by the legal department: Place of Hearing and Date.

PART II.-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.The two features commented on in the beginning of the Report for the previous week still call for notice. Imports are low in the case of wheat and wheaten flour, and the decline in the consumption of home-fed meat is marked. On the other hand there has been an increase in the supplies of barley, maize and oats.Imports.The most marked feature in the Import Table for the week ending June 22nd is the heavy decline in wheat and flour (Table A). In equivalent grain the falling off on the week before amounted to 27,500 tons, and on the corresponding week of 1917 to 85,500 tons. The imports for June to date are much below those of the corresponding weeks last year, but, owing to the heavy imports in the preceding two months of this

The milk index (Table E) has during the last three weeks oscillated about 113. The quantity of milk carried on each of the railways included in the return is now much greater than in September last, the increases since that month having varied from 10 per cent, in the case of the Great Western and Midland Railways to 20 per cent, for the Great Eastern/ :x  5875-4 1iyear, this need cause no alarm, and the reserve at the end of the cereal year is, amply secured&apos;if imports can be maintained at their present level. &apos; Consignments of other cereals were satisfactory, aggregating 46,200 tons. While the arrivals of barley and maize were double those of the preceding week, they were only about one-third the average for the year ; on the other hand, those of oats were three times the average of the year and up to the standard of 1913.  Nearly 19,000 tons of rice were received.Bacon and hams fell from 17,600 tons to 11,700 tons, but an increase of 3,900 tons in other meat brought the total of meat of all kinds to within 2,000 tons of the figure of the week before and up to the average of the current year.Receipts of lard were the lowest since the beginning of April and left but a small margin over the quantity now being distributed weekly.Cheese maintained its recent improvement, but still falls very far short of the anticipated supply. Of butter, 3,100 tons arrived, against 2,700 tons the previous week and 1,200 tons in the corresponding week of last year. :Sugar improved from 13,200 tons to 16,200 tons ; the latter quantity, however, is still far below: current requirements.Consumption., Meat.-The total quantity of meat, home and foreign, at the four markets included in Table B was 5 per cent, higher in the week ended June 15th than in the week jhefore, and the same, as in the corresponding week of 1917. A week ago the deficit on 1917 was 20 per cent.The improvement in the supply was due to an increase in imported meat to a , level 81 per cent, above that a year ago.   Home-fed supplies were slightly lower on the week and represented but 31 per cent, of the supplies for the week ended June 16th, 1917.Aggregate supplies of beef and mutton at the Central London Markets for the week ended J une 22nd were 2 per cent, higher than in the corresponding week of last year.   Of this total, 93 per cent, was imported against 58 per cent, a year ago ; home-, fed supplies were 17 per cent, lower, and foreign supplies 16 per cent, higher, than in the previous week.Live stock supplies for May (Table C) show a decrease on April as regards both cattle and sheep. Supplies of fat cattle fell steadily throughout the month, while those of fat sheep showed an upward tendency from the middle of the month. These two movements have continued in the present month.Fish. Total supplies of fish at Billingsgate Market showed a further decline during the week ended June 22nd. Compared with the previous week the fall was but slight, but compared with the corresponding week of 1917 the fall was more than 32 per cent.Arrivals at other inland markets during the past few weeks have, in the main, varied in the same direction as at Billingsgate: 
Stocks.Movements in the estimated stocks of the principal cereals during June are shown below. The seasonal decline in barley, oats, and maize continued during the week ended June 24th. The fail of 31,000 tons in wheat since June 1st is to be contrasted with an increase of 173,000 in the corresponding period of 1917, Stocks of wheat are, however, still 354,000 tons higher than a year ago :--Commodity.
