/Confidential.LABOUR POSITION IN MUNITION INDUSTRIES.(19th June 1918.)I circulate the following notes which have been prepared in the Intelligence and Statistics Section of the Ministry of Munitions on the labour position in munition industries.Statistics of Strikes in the Week ending the 12th June.During the week ending the 12th June, 42,637 working days or just over one-fourth of 1 per cent, of the possible working time were lost through strikes on Ministry of Munitions work. Three-sevenths of the total lost time occurred at the Cumberland Iron Ore Mines, where 6,000 workers lost three days each.Temper of Labour.Difficulties as to labour have rather increased during the past week. In the majority of cases they have been satisfactorily dealt with. Strikes and threatened strikes frequently take place on trivial grounds, and unless dealt with quickly are apt to be exaggerated much beyond their real meaning. For instance, in a factory at Ipswich (Messrs. Ransomes, Sims and Jefferies, Ltd.), where practically no strikes had ever been known, a woman who had been working at a fitter&apos;s bench was placed on sheet-metal work and not transferred simultaneously from the direction of a fitter to that of a skilled sheet-metal worker. Without preliminary protest or warning work immediately ceased, only to be resumed as soon as the inadvertence it was nothing more had been corrected. In the principal strikes now proceeding those at Gorse Mill and Lilac Mill (Hollinwood), where 4,000 men are out agitators, among them C. H. Stavenhagen, president of the Electrical Trades Union, have been at work multiplying pretexts and making mountains out of mole hills. As the result of. a conference of the representatives of the unions concerned, a basis of settlement, which the unions are to urge strongly for the acceptance of the men, has been reached. The most widespread trouble, however, arises out of the extension of dilution. The trades opposing it most vehemently are the sheet-metal workers, the ironmoulders, the coremakers, and the aircraft woodworkers; reports of their opposition have been received from the Birmingham, Glasgow, Manchester, and Bristol areas.In the building industry wage rates vary from district to district even more than in the engineering trades, and competition for labour grows constantly keener. In Lancashire, particularly, the building and aircraft industries are lighting for skilled woodworkers. The operatives try to make the most of the opportunity for forcing up rates of wages, and press demands which, if granted, would react unfortunately on the wage situation in other industries. Central control of rates had accordingly become necessary, and an Order, foreshadowed in these Notes for the 22nd May, is now being printed.The Order is intended to stabilise existing rates and to control subsequent variations. It directs that the rates of wages paid to manual workers on building work in connection with munitions shall be those in force on the date of the Order as the result of any award under Part I. of the Munitions of War Act, 1915, or of a decision of the Building Labour Committee. In districts where wages have not been determined in this way, the rates will be those recognised in the district on the 15th April by a Concilation Board, or where there is no Board by the employers&apos; associations and trade unions for the building trades.A  (33)6018  Pk 20 &apos; 125  6/18  E &amp; SWINSTON S. CHURCHILL.I.-STRIKES.II. -WAGES IN THE BUILDING TRADES
The rates prescribed by the Order may subsequently he varied by agreement between employers and workmen with the consent of the Minister of Munitions, or by any award under Part I. of the Munitions of War Act, 1915, or by an Order of the Minister.III.-IMPROVED TIMEKEEPING.Timekeeping in the factories is improving. The withdrawal of protection certificates from bad timekeepers is,doubtless having its effect. From the Ponders End Shell Works, however, is reported a case of practically unbroken assiduity on the part of an entire factory, which can only be explained by a combination of patriotic feeling and enlightened management. Four thousand workers are employed, and in the last six months only 10 hours have been lost through avoidable causes. During one period of three weeks, the workers had a perfect record; no time at all was lost by anybody through any avoidable cause.IV.-SUSPENDED RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES.The Munitions of War Act, 1915, requires a record to be kept of departures from any non-statutory rule, practice, or custom in controlled establishments tending to restrict production or employment. These records of suspended restrictive practices are collected by local officers of the Ministry and submitted to labour organisations, and are then sent to the Ministry, where they are preserved as agreed statements of fact, or, where agreement has not been reached, are recorded without prejudice.The returns show that up to the 3rd June 25,024 records have been made, and *21,593 have been sent to the Ministry. Of these 21,593 records the greater part (67 per cent.) are concerned with the introduction of female labour. Of the remainder, 15 per cent, deal with novel processes, 6 per cent, with cases of male dilution, 5 per cent, with changes in wage systems, 4 per cent, with the waiving ol lines of demarca-tion between classes of skilled workers, and 3 per cent, with alterations of hours and of methods of working.
