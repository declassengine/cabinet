We noted, last weak that the Danish delegates at i/aBhlngton had put forward further proposals for reatrie ting tho exports of Danish produce to the Central Bmpiros,     &apos;rhoy hare also submitted provisional estimates for the rations of imports required by Denmark from overseas* &apos;     he Danish proposals are not satisfactory, but we shall raise no objection to the United states War Trade Board ac-copting them as a basis for their negotiations with tho Ifcaish Government provided Denmark agrees to hand over 465,000 tons of Banish shipping tc the Allies as the War Srade Board have suggested. &apos;J!he War&apos; Trade Board realise that tho proposed Danish rations are in many cases excessive.   They have   asked   that representatives of the French and British Governments should be authorised to assist them in discussing these rations with the Banish dele-gates at Washington.It is reported thai Oerman delegates will arrive at Copenhagen on July 7th to negotiate an Economic Agreement with Denmark for four months as from August 1sta   Denmark desires to obtain supplies of chemicals from Germany, more particularly iodine, bismuth, quick-silver and their respective salts.   Germany will probably demand fats in compensation.   The Germans have continually pressed for larger supplies of  Danish butter.  Considerable quantities of Banish fat would in the absence of any special arrangement with37/lfi on June 19th to 34.65 on June 26th.The Exchange on

It might accordingly bo ?/orth while to supply Denmark with tho above chemicals,   it in ox-pectefi that the Germans will demand increased prioee for Gorman fuel owing to the increase in the prices of British cottl.   It ie bolievod that tho coal position in Germany has improved considerably of late and that the Germane are willing to supply Denmark with all tho ooal she needs if suitable compensation can bo obtained.She German Government ere protesting against tho use which British wareraft convoying vessels bound for iforwogian ports are mak-ing of Norwegian territorial waters.    ?he ITorwegim Government have pointed out that the manner in which Germany lo conducting the war necessitates and justifies the convoy system.   But tho Norwegian Haval Authorities ask that British wareraft escorting or assembling convoys visiting Norwegian Ports, will, if possible, avoid making use of lorwegian territorial waters *   They admit, however, that it will be impossible for our escorting craft to remain outside during bad weather.On the 5th June a meeting was hold at Christianla between re-presentatives or. the Norwegian Shipowners and the Norwegian foreign -Office and Shipping Administration, and the German Diplomatic and Haval Authorities, to discuss the question of German safe conducts for Norwegian ships.   Ik? general Agreement was reached, but the German representatives intimated that safe conducts would bo granted to lorwegian passenger vessels sailing &quot;between Norway and the United States on the following e one it ions;-(a) ThJ.it the ship should neither bo sold nor chartered to subjects of a nation at war with Germany or her Allies or to subjects of a Neutral country.(b) That the ship should perform no intermediate voy&amp;go but should return direct to tho home port.(c) That the ship on its return voyage should carry no cargo other than cargo destined for Dorway and that-such cargo should not be re-exported from Hoxway In any form whatsoever.
2673.18 no agreement was reached on the gene pal question, the Norwegian America Lino decided that S.S. &quot;Bergensfjord&quot; should sail after giv-ing a guarantee direct to the Koyal llorwoglun Finance &amp; Customs 3?e-partmont accepting the above conditions;,   li. Ihlen hae assured the United States Minister at chrietiania that the Norwegian Government are not &quot;bound by these conditions, but that the Company muct fulfil them or be guilty of a branch of the Norwegian law.   It should be noted that condition (o) apparently precludes tho &quot;Borgensfjord&quot; from accepting cargo required in iforway for the production of commodities to be exported to the Allies.   The refusal of such cargo would be a breach of the Agreement between. Norway and the Associated Governments, She Unltod States Minister at Christian^.; io advising the United. States Government, If the point should bo raised, to force the issue by detaining the vessel.Herr Warburg, of the Hamburg Banking House, was recently in Horway trying to arrange a loan with a group of Norwegian Banks through tho Bank of   Norway*    She. Gortons are asking for monthly credits of iCr* 5,000,000 for the six months July to December 19X8. The loan would be secured by Gorman Imperial treasury bills, and the credits would be used for financing German purchases In Horway.   She Bank of II or way appears to have met with little or no assistance from the other Horwegien banks.ISSSMS *M* London cannot guarantee that goods passing over the Limhurg Hallway from Germany to Belgium will In no case bo used for military purposes by tho German Authorities.   Hoither arms, munitions aeroplanes, military equipment or foodstuffs for tho German armies will be allowed to pass but articles which do not fall under the above categories must be atmitted.   We claim that the traffic should be confined to goods exclusively civilian;   tho Dutch Government con-tend that all goods should be allowed to pass which are not exclusive ly military.     $he traffic over the Limburg Hallway will not exceed 24 trains daily each way, whioh corresponds to tho normal traffic In

Meantime H* Snouok, who Is now Chairman of the Commit-tee appointed by the Netherlands Government to negotiate foreign Agreements, is preparing a memorandum dealing with the All ice! propo-sels.   M* Snouok apparently hopes that the proposed negotiations may be resumed at the Hague.   We have warned him t1u.it if the Netherlands Government desire to modify the Allied proposals in any important particulars the discussions must take place in London,   M. Snouok thinks it essential for the Motherlands Government to be represented by someone familiar with tho negotiations now proceeding between the Dutch and German Oovornm ants, as tho negotiations of tho ITethorlawls government with the Associated Governments and the  Gorman Government are interdependent.    As none of the Dutch officials at present on-gaged in negotiations with Germany oan loave the Hague, he has surges-ted that iu  roller might if necessary come to London as dologate of the Hothorlanas Governments   M. Krooiler has first-hand icaowledge of the German attitude towards our proposals and is strongly in fa-vour of expediting an Agreement betwoen the Hetherlands and the Asso-diated Governments.    He recently resigned Iris position as oomraereial advisor to the Hatherlsnds Government ae a protest against their ro-fusal to proceed with these negotiations. \Uhe convoy which the 1! other land s   Government -propose to send to the Dutch Bast Indies has not yet sailed.   Lists of the passengers and &apos; cargo to be carried have been submitted to H.H. Oonsul General at Rotterdam, whose scrutiny will bo deemed sufficient by H.M. Govern-aont.   We are still insisting upon the discharge of the German dyes which have been accepted by the Convoy.    11* London represents that their removal would involve considerable delay and asks that they may b0 forward under a guarantee that on their arrival in the
