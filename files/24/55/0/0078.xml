BOARD OF AGRICULTURE! AND FISHERIES. 1%      Report for week ended 25th June. 1918*Land Division.Small Holding Colonies.Patrington.      The farming operations during the week consisted of ploughing fallows, horse hoeing mangolds, thrashing &quot;beans, oats and wheat, horse homing potatoes, and hand homing all crops as before.    llowing seed  hay was also commenced.    Two of the first waggoners on the Colony were called to the Colours under the &quot;Clean Cut&quot; scheme, and left on the 19th instant.    The weather for the greater part of tho week was cold and windy.    The crops, produce and stock disposed of during the week included 112 qrs. wheat, 36 qrs. &quot;beans, 28t C.rs. whole oats, 40 st. mangolds, and 245 eggs.Holbeaoh.    The horses wore still busy amongst the potatoes, scarifying and ridging up, also cleaning out dung yards and carting materials for the builders.    It wae also hoped to complete the cutting of the seeds on tho 22nd inst.    The women continued to be busy weeding amongst the potatoes and other crops.    The live stock are progressing satisfactorily, and thirty more pigs were despatched for sale.Management Committee of.the Kclham Estate.During the last fortnight no rain has fallen and we have experienced what is an unusual drought in this county.    On the whole the crops have not suffered much harm.porn crops.   Reviewing the whole of the crops the position remains about the same as when last reported upon, and present indications point to a moderate harvest.    The two outstanding features are that the oats after turf, with few exceptions, have gone ahead beyond expectations.    On the other hand the barley on the lighter and poorer arable fields have suffered badly from drought:   consequently the yield on these two fields will be very poor.Some of the whe?.t has been in ear for a week, and in one or two cases the barley is also showing.Mangolds.    The position with regard to this orori has improved considerably:   a short time ago the prospects were none too favourable, but by continued hoeing the health of the plant has been improved*Beet.    The plant of sugar beet appears to be most successful.Swedes.    65 acres have been sown,   the &quot;Fly&quot; is reported to be bad in places, but so far wc have 14 acres well up, and will probably escape.    The weather has been too dry for all the remainder of the crop to germinate, and unless we get rain soon the chances of a successful crop will*be small.Potatoes.   20 aorcs have been planted and these look very promising although rain is badly needed.    The question of spraying is being attended to.Hay.   It is estimated that the orop will approximate 600 tons. Advantage has been taken of the drought, and all the seed hay has been mown (69 acreu).
Fallows.    The two remaining fields have been either oultivated for turnips or ploughed for fallows, and at present there is not a foul acre of land on the whole section.    With the exception of about 300 aores the 1,700 acres taken in hand has been dressed with phosphatic manures.    Wool-waste has been sown on the fallows, and this is being continued as consignments come to hand, and 40 acres of the land for swedes has been dressed with ground lime at the rate of 10 cwts. per acre.Oattiec    It ia reported that all the cattle with the exception of a few drapes are doing well, and many are nearly in the fat stage.Prisoners of War - Horses and  ahpur.     Following a decision made by the Committee the transfer of. the horses and implements is being arranged between the Food Production Department, and ourselves, the transfer dating as from the 10th June 1918.Etas, ^pflttc tt wJranffft *The organisation of labour for the pulling of the crop is now complete.    The harvest is expected to commence at the end of the present week in Somersetshire, and the camps in this area are already in existenoe and ready for the reception of the workers.These early camps are being used also for the training of gang-leaders and others subsequently to be transferred to other areas where the harvest commences some two or three weeks later.The permanent staff of all areas is also assembling at Yeovil during the coming week for experience in the handling of the crop and the workers in the fields.The growth of the crop is generally speaking satisfactory, though in some eastern distriots the lack of rain will result in a small yield of fibre.Work in the factories proceeds on the lineB of previousreports.Tithe, Copyhold. Commons and Survey Branch.During the past week 5 applications for redemption, 1 for merger and 1 for altered apportionment of tithe rentcharge and two for the enfranchisement of copyholds have been received, while 5 redemptions, 2 mergers and 2 enfranchisements have been confirmed.Tithe rentcharge ceases and is extinguished as soon as payment has been made of the half-yearly portion of the.tithe rentcharge acoruing due subsequently to the payment of the whole of the redemption money;   but, in the meantime, the titho rentcharge continues payable notwithstanding the redemption proceedings, and is oollected by the owner of the rentcharge.    In these circumstances, as a great deal of tithe rentcharge in the country is payable on, the 1st January and 1st July, a special endeavour is being made to issue instructions wherever possible for the payment of redemption moneys before the 1st prox.    In tho case of extraordinary rentcharge payable under the Extraordinary Tithe Redemption Act, 1886, the date of extinguishment is not dependent upon the date of the payment of tho redemption money but upon the date of the certificate of redemption, and accordingly in redemptions of this character steps are being taken to issue the certificate&quot; wherever practicable before the 1st prox.
Joint Commit teg of th? fioard of Agriculture and the Ministry of Food.Reports are reaching the Committee of the existence of considerable discontent in certain districts owing to the drifting of agricultural workers td other industries.    One of our Representatives -        repoHs &quot;we are hemmed in here by large Steel and Iron Works, some in oouree of construction.    These are alive with young men earning huge wages and working eight hours a day (sometimes).    We (the farmers) work 13 or 14 hours per day.    Our men of military age drill in the V.T.C.;   these men lean over the fenoes smoking, and jeet at the boys drilling.    The average farmer who is, of course, only a &quot;Countryman&quot;, cannot understand it;   some of us can&quot;. *.Ordnance Survey.During the week 33,461 maps were sent to France, 22,953 to the Admiralty, 5,092 to the Air Ministry, 10,593 to the War Office, and 1,042 Other Services. 1Publications  Branch.The number of applications for ordinary issues of the Leaflets was 2,357, in response to which 6,270 copies of Leaflets were dispatched.In addition 23,500 copies of Leaflets were dispatched to applicants for supplies in bulk for distribution.    Further, 11,000 copies of leaflets were supplied to the Food Production Department for direct distribution.Applications were received for 655 copies of the three Bound Volumes of Leaflets, and 391 copies of the pamphlet &quot;How to Manage an Allotment&quot; were sent out.The usual enquiries bearing directly and indirectly on agricultural publications have been received and dealt with by the Branch.Fisheries Division.Administrative Section.   Regulations under D.O.R.A. giving the Board further powers in regard to fisheries were confirmed by order in council on the 25th inot.    The new powers will enable the Board to require private fisheries to be worked to their full extent, and also enable the Board to take over any fishery or to exercise the right of several or regulating fishery in any waters, or in publio shell-fish grounds.    The intention of the Department is to exeroise these powers in reBpeot of eel and shell-fish fisheries but a general power is taken in order that action may be taken in the interests of the national food supplies, if and when occasion arises in connection with river or inshore sea fisheries.Before any efficacious action can be taken for the purification or development of public shell-fish beds, it is necessary that the Board should be placed in the position of being able to exercise an ownership of the beds-in question, and this is the main object of the new regulations. .The Board propose to exercise these powers in several polluted areas round the CoaBt, and to construct purifying tanks . through which the shell-fish will be passed before being placed on the market for human consumption.The general question of extending the fishing season for salmon as a war time measure is under the consideration of the three Central Fishery Authorities.
A number of applications for relaxation of fishing restrictions have been reoeived and are under consideration.    It is not possible to prescribe a general relaxation as the circumstances of eaoh particular fishery have to be considered, but, wherever possible, action is taken in the direction of obtaining increased landings of fish.    There is still a large correspondence on matters of general administration.Permit Section. 40 permits have been issued to fishing vessels and 14 cancelled.A report has been received of an attack by a submarine on a oonvoy of trawlers returning from Iceland with fish.     One vessel was damaged.Uptor Loan Committee.    The work of the Committee&apos;s installing mechanic at Hastings has now come to an end.    He has been employed there with some interruptions for several weeks and has oompleted the installations in three boats.A Folkestone fishermen came to the Office to enquire about a second engine for his boat.    He has been working this motor-boat for four years;   but the success of the boats engined by the Committee has convinced him that he has not enough power.Th-^re is no slackening of the work at Southwick andShoreham.One of the large boats engined by the Committee in the T?*est Country has unfortunately been destroyed by fire.Fish Food Committee.Sunnly of material for the Russian Fisheries.   This work has absorbed the time of the staff practically for.the whole of the week in obtaining permits, checking orders, arranging railway transit, loading the trawlers, two of which have now sailed, checking and paying accounts amounting to nearly  20,000.Incidental work has been tho granting of licences and permits for petrol, paint, cane for baskets, and other materials.Eel fishing.   A report of the Fresh Water Fish Committee has been considered, and the Committee have agreed to advance money for the catching of eels by means of nets, in Poole Harbour, Fleetwood Water, Christchurch Harbour, and the Yarmouth district.Shell-fish.   Two new appointments have been made to the staff for purposes of investigation and cultivation, as the work has largely increased.     Preparation of plans for the tanks at Teighmouth are proceeding.Freshwater Fish Committee.The principal events of the past week have been the consent of the Fish Pood Committee to advance funds (estimated at ;32,200) to develop the Eel Fisheries at Poole Harbour, Christchurch Harbour, The Fleet Water and Yarmouth (Bure, Vaveney and Yare Rivers).Negotiations to enable the Committee to carry out its plans at those places can now be pressed forward.On the 20th inst., at the invitation of the King, some of the members of the Committee proceeded to Windsor and inspected the netting for coarse fish carried on under the management of Mr. Kenneth G. Lundie, in some of the Lakes.     On receiving further information, promised by Mr. Lundie, a report on the matter will be prepared.
