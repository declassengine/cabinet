These engines will be used in fighting planes at th* Front.The Board acts as purchasing agent on behalf of the Admiralty, the Timber Controller, the Department of Aeronautics, the War Office, and the Ministry of Shipping.All the timber seoured from Canada for all purposes in England, private as well as Government, is being purchased by the Board.Aoetio acid is being produced in a plant built for thepurpose costing.................................... $ 1,800,000.Ferro silicon is being produced in two plants, one now under construction.700 tons of Carbide per month are being shipped.The Board is acting as agent for the United States Ordnance Department in arranging for contracts and supervising their completion for the munitions and supplies which the Ordnance Department desires to secure in Canada.

Work of great value was. performed by the Committee.   Later, it was considered desirable to form a Board directly responsible to the Imperial Minister of Munitions; hence the operations of the Shell Committee were passed over to the Imperial Munitions Board.   For the purpose of centralising authority and securing prompt and sustained action, administrative and executive authority was vested in the Chairman of the Board.   The Chairman and four members of tho Board give constant service, -three in Canada; one in London.   All negotiations between the Board in Canada and the various Ministries are carried on through the member of the Board resident in Lon&amp;fM, and who has been assigned quarters in one of the buildings occupied by the Ministry of Munitions.The work is divided in a manner much similar to the division in the Ministry of Munitions.   Business men have been asked to take charge of various departments, of which they are called Directors.   These departments number about twenty, and the Directors carry on their duties in Ottawa, in Toronto, in Vancouver and in Viotoria.The Purchasing and Steel Department buys all materials entering into munitions, arranges for the forging of steel, and distributes the forgings and components to the machining plants situated in the various Provinces between the Atlantic and the Pacific.The Shipbuilding Department purchases, and supervises the construction of engines and boilers for the 58 wooden ships, and purchases the timber and supplies for the hulls, and has an operating section which, is installing tho engines., boilers and equipment in these boats.The Explosives Department operates the National plants producing nitrocellulose, cordite and T-H-T, with the necessary acid plants, and operates the plants producing acetone and methyl ethyl koytone.The Forging Department operates the National plant, British Forgings. in which the steel turnings are melted in electric furnaces and subsequently the steel is forged into 6&quot; forgings.The Aeronautic Department operates the plant producing aeroplanes, snd under a constructive section, builds all aerodromes,, machine shops, barracks and officers&apos; quarters at tho various coiops, as well as purchases all supplies and equipment for the Royal flying Corps.
The Timber Section producing aeroplane spruce and fir, conducts logging operations in British Columbia and operates tugs for the delivery of logs to mills which cut them for account of Board under supervision of Board&apos;s officer.   These logging operations call for the production of 248,000,000 foot of spruoo logs in 45 camps placed in a territory extending ovor 600 miles North and South.The Fuae Department operates the National plant. British Munitions, where Time ?uaea are loader. .?he Engineering Department chocks and rectifies all gauges, keeping for this purpose a staff of engineers and&apos; an operating force of expert tool makers in machine shops under their direction.The Accounting   is carried on by a staff of 360 men and women. Thirteen ledgers, upon which.the accounts aro carried, are balanced every night by. about ten o?clock when a corps of auditors take charge of the books, and the business of the previous day is completely checked and audited before&apos; the business of the succeeding day commences.The inspection is all carried out under the Direotor of Inspection, a British officer, responsible to the Director General of Inspection in $reat Britain.The work whioh has been accomplished by the Board has only been possible through the co-operation and serious service of a large body of men and women who have folt a pride and satisfaction in identification with the work.   The major portion of tho senior men have been taken from prominent positions in business and professional life, and have served without remuneration.The work accomplished by the manufacturers should be highly ooamended.   They have shown resource, capacity and courage in a field in whieh they had had no previous experience.   Their work-men and workwomen have become expert in operations requiring fidelity and accurate working to fine dimensions, for which their previous occupations had not fitted them.   The proficiency which has been established reflects the intelligence and adaptability of the Canadian workman.In the Report issued by the War Cabinet for the year 1917, there appears the following;-?&quot;Canada&apos;s contribution during- tho last year had been &quot;very striking.   15 pea/cent of the total expenditure of the &quot;Ministry of Munitions in the last six months of the year &quot;was incurred in that country.   She has manufactured nearly &quot;every type of shell from the 18-pr. to the 9.2&quot;.   In the case &quot;of the m m, no less than 55 per cent of the output of &quot;shrapnel shells in the last six months came from Canada, and &quot;most of these, were complete rounds of ammunition which went &quot;direct to France.   Canada also contributed 42 per cent of &quot;the total 4.5 shells, 27 per cent of the 6&quot; shells, 20 per &quot;cent of tha 50 pr. H.S. shells,-15 per cent of the 8&quot; and &quot;16 per cent of the 9.2&quot;.   In addition, Canada has supplied &quot;shall forgings, ammunition components, propellants, acetone, &quot;T.A.T., aluminium, nickel, nickel matte, aeroplane parts, &quot;agricultural machinery and timber, besides quantities of &quot;railway materials, including no less than 450 miles of rails &quot;torn up from Canadian railways which were shipped direct &quot;to France.&quot;
It may intarttt you to know that tho production of $&quot; sholXe in Canada now roproeontf aom*wh*t more than 40 par oont of tho total production of this aholl roquirofr to eorve tho guns at tho J&quot;ront.
