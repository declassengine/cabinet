COAL POSITION.The supply of coal for export has increased in the Bristol Channel but at all other of the coal loading districts, supplies are very short.     With regard to additional coal for France, inquiries made from the French Ports show that for the present the French will not be able to deal with any larger quantities than those that have been shipped recently.     The matter is being taken up with the Authorities in Paris through General Nash but it is hardly likely that shipments can be increased at least for a few weeks.
