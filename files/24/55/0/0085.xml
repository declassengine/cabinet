Printed for the War Cabinet. June 1918.SECRET.19THE LABOUR SITUATION.Report from the Ministry of Labour for the week ending 26th June, 1918.Part I: General Remarks.Existing symptoms of unrest in the Labour&apos;world are discussed.Part II: Press Comments.The opinion of the Labour press on military affairs, on the League of Nations, on post-war trade, on. the Labour Conference, on the Internationale, on Whitley Committees, on food, and on sundry other matters is described.Part III: District Reports.With the exception of unrest at Austin&apos;s Motor Works, Birmingham, and a certain amount of unrest in the North-Western area and in Scotland, the country is quiet.Part IV: Disputes.(a.) Involving a Stoppage of Work. The strike at the Lilac and Gorse Mills has been settled and no strike of importance is now in progress.(b.) Not involving a Stoppage of Work. No serious dispute is now in progress.Symptoms of Unrest.No trouble of serious importance existed a,t the end of the week with the exception of that at Austin&apos;s, in Birmingham, where trouble is endemic and is certainly due in large part to unsympathetic management. Conditions are also disturbed at Coventry where there is a powerful body of shop stewards, some of whose leaders are extremist. Otherwise the country is quiet, but there are signs that Labour in general is in a suspicious mood, strikes frequently taking place on trivial grounds, and, once started, being liable to spread with rapidity.There are at the present time two causes which give rise to this suspicion. The first is the scheme for the enrolment of war agricultural, and war work volunteers, who thereby obtain exemption from the liability to military service. The second is dilution. With regard to the former, it is argued with some show of reason that the arrangements practically amount to a mild form of industrial conscription, for these volunteers are protected only as long as they continue in certain specified employments. The scheme is not generally unpopular, and has indeed been received with approval in many quarters. An unfortunate circumstance, however, occurred at Barrow, which brought the scheme forcibly to the notice of the Barrow shop stewards, who are referring it to the National Amalgamation Committee of Shop Stewards for consideration.Dilution is giving rise to difficulties everywhere, and the Ministry of Munitions cites a number of cases of marked opposition which are typical. The reasons for ithe opposition are two-fold. In the first place probably the more important reason lies in the recognition by the unions of the fact that any further comb-out ofSummary.I.-General Remarks.lino-35]b
essential industries is dependent on a prior extension of dilution in those industries. The opposition to dilution has no reference to the existing comb-out, which in some industries is practically complete, and for which arrangements in all industries have been made. There is, however, anticipation that the future course of the war may demand still further sacrifices on the part of industry, which might take the form of raising the ages in the Schedule of Protected Occupations and List of Certified Occupations. This would clearly be impossible unless some reserve of labour were available for the purposes of dilution, and the present opposition has reference to the creation of such reserve.In addition there is the ordinary economic objection on the part of the skilled men to the formation of a body of labour which by its training will be in a position effectively to compete with skilled labour in the post-war period, and there is undoubtedly considerable apprehension in the skilled unions that the existence of dilutees will tend to a reduction of wages when the war ends. For this reason con-siderable opposition to dilution exists even in the minds of many who are convinced that the ultimate defeat of Germany in the field justifies the widest demands for man power for the army.There is a further reason for industrial unrest in the reaction from the moral and physical exertions consequent on the great German offensive of March. The immediate effect of that oifensive was to stimulate patriotic labour to intense exertion, and, with the apparent removal of immediate danger a certain relaxation of effort both moral and physical has inevitably occurred. It must be remembered that Labour has been working at high pressure for the last four years, and that the stimulus which has resulted in extraordinary outturn cannot but have resulted in proportionate fatigue. The signs of that fatigue are unrest in the workshop and pacifist agitation outside. It is worthy of note that activity in the field, whether in the nature of defensive or offensive operations, coincides with tranquillity in the &apos; industrial world, whereas a time of apparent deadlock tends to result in discontent in the workshops and pacifist agitation throughout the country.There is no reason to suspect that the great body of labour is other than loyal and patriotic, or that it will fail to respond to any demands which may be made upon it during the-time of anxiety which is anticipated in the near future. Firm treatment by the Government combined with ample opportunity for ventilation of any grievances that may exist is a oommonsense policy, which will command the support of the working classes, while suppression of grievances or vacillating policy will only tend to increase the power of the irreconcilable minority.II. Press Comments.Military Affairs.The &quot;New Statesman&quot; has an elaborate review of the Austrian operations, Since the Allied supports in Italy had largely to be withdrawn to France, the position in Italy was one of considerable anxiety. The Italian armyi however, had been reorganised, and symptoms of growing- weakness had appeared on the side of Austria-Hungary. The result of the offensive has been to confirm our hopes, and to strengthen the Allied position.League of Nations,The publication of Lord Grey&apos;s pamphlet has reopened discussion. The &quot; New Statesman,&quot; as is its wont, strongly presses, not only for whole-hearted support from members of the Government, but also for getting the ideal aim embodied in concrete shape, as to the most workable and effective machinery for compulsory arbitration, for international legislation, for the administration of tropical areas, and for the just distribution of raw materials.The Labour press is deeply interested in the idea. The &quot;Herald,&quot; while attacking militarism, holds that its greatest defeat would be sustained by estab-lishing a League of Nations. Once such an aim is expressed, Germany, and all other nations, must follow. &quot; Justice,&quot; however, thinks that Socialist and Labour parties are committing themselves before giving the scheme due consideration. The &quot; Clarion &quot; is equally sceptical.
32?5Post-War Trade.On the subject of trade after the war, the &quot; Clarion &quot; is inclined to accept the protectionist views in the recent reports of the Board of Trades Committees, rather than the suggestion in Mr. Wells&apos; new book that trade with Germany must be restored.Mr. Brailsford, in the &quot; Herald,&quot; has a long, rambling article on the economic weapon. In the possibility of closing the world to German trade, the Allies have an unrivalled asset in bargaining. If used adroitly and boldly it might end the war to-day. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; has nothing good to say of the reports, and describes their publication as disastrous, since they provide the pan-Germans with arguments to prove that the Allies are aiming at&apos;the prevention of economic restoration of Germany.Germany.M. Huysmans, in the &quot;Herald,&quot; summarises the discussions in the Majority Party National Council in Germany on the 31st May. He prefers the views expressed by Ebert to the speech of Scheidemann. The former opposed the policy followed in the East, and said that the peace suggestions of the Majority are con-tained in the Stockholm Memorandum. Scheidemann regretted that the Labour and Socialist parties in the Entente had not accepted negotiations. He held them also responsible, along with the Bolsheviks, for the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, of which he did not approve. M. Huysmans asks what the Majority group has done against the invasion of the Ukraine and Finland. -The Munitions Volunteers.The^&quot; Herald&quot; objects strongly to the new War Munitions Volunteer scheme, and reports that many resolutions of protest have been received from trade unionists all over the country. The scheme seems likely to^ lead to a revival on a large scale of the shop steward movement, which has been quiescent during the last few months.Socialist Policy.&quot; Justice &quot; begins a series of articles on Socialist policy in municipal matters. It asks correspondents to unite in describing what work has already been done. It is necessary first to create civic interest, next a new body of municipal councillors is needed, and municipal elections should take place early. The distinctive marks of the Socialist municipal policy should be its recognition of what is good, its incorruptible efficiency, and its insistence on the duties and rights of citizens.Labour Conference.A great deal of space is devoted to the Conference of the Labour party in London, &quot; Forward &quot; and the &quot; Herald &quot; refer in some detail to the resolutions, and commend them for acceptance. The former cherishes a strong belief in the potential reasonableness of mankind, and holds that when acts are passed realising the aims which men and women of the Labour party set before them, we shall have arrived at the dawn of a higher, brighter, and nobler civilisation, Two main reflections are noted by the &quot; Herald.&quot; The first is that the world will be much better after the war, if the Labour party is in power. The second is the bitter thought that, for many who are fighting to-day, there can be on this earth no reconstruction. The writer then laments the lost opportunities for peace, and holds that the only alterna-tive to end this war in the immediate future, is the revival of a Labour Internationale.The Internationale.&quot; Justice&quot; continues to complain of the intention to discuss an international conference. The writer is not satisfied with Mr. Henderson&apos;s explanation that the foreign members will merely speak at a special open session, and asserts that there is no occasion for such a meeting. In view of the discussions reported to have taken place in Holland, Troelstra cannot be regarded merely as a fraternal delegate. The &quot; Herald &quot; prints an article by M. Huysmans on the grant of a passport to M. Troelstra, in which he asserts that M. Troelstra has been entirely neutral. Recently[1100-35] B 2
he declared openly that Germany should consider Alsace-Lorraine as a general European question.The Labour Party.Some regrets were expressed by the &quot;Herald&quot; and the &quot; Clarion&quot; at Mr. Havelock Wilson&apos;s proposals for a division in the Labour party. The &quot; Clarion,&quot; however, regards the chief cause of this threatened cleavage to be Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, regarding whom it makes some sarcastic remarks. Asserting that the new trade union party wishes to sacrifice the aid of Mr. Macdonald&apos;s quite unusual talents, it suggests that this course might be taken at once. An article in &quot; Justice &quot; points out the danger of clerical intervention in Socialism. Esoteric teachers, Freemasons, and Oddfellows have separatist tendencies, and the clergy are a danger in this respect.  A church-dominated State cannot be allowed.Whitley Committees.Some interest continues in Whitley Committees, especially in connection with the hesitation of the Government to consider them in State-controlled industries. Mr. Ramsay Macdonald in &quot;Forward,&quot; while referring to the danger of their breaking trade union unity, and separating the workshop from the industry, thinks, on the whole, favourably of them, and, in any case, considers public services are in a special position. Mr. Cole, in the &quot; Guildsman,&quot; is critical of them as tending to delay the abolition of the wage system, though they may be of value in stimulating combination, and in bringing more clearly to the front the nature of the working-class demands for exclusive control. He prefers the Paisley collective contract, scheme, which, by transferring control of the workshop from employers to the trade , unions, will do a great deal to undermine the power of the capitalist class. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; and &quot; Call &quot; ask for the recognition of committees in the Post Office.Food.The &quot; New Statesman &quot; publishes an article from a correspondent designed to show the important part that Ireland is playing as a base, not only for the British food supply, but for British agriculture itself.Few specific complaints are made this week. &quot;Forward &quot; quotes a case of a municipal kitchen which was unable to get a supply of sugar for making jam. Mr. Hyndman, in dealing with the Consumers&apos; Council in &quot;Justice,&quot; describes the dis-cussion of a resolution urging Government to take in hand production, distribution, and control of agricultural produce. While admitting the argument put forward at the meeting, that railways, factories, and mines, being organised by companies, can be dealt with more easily than land, he asserts that millions of acres in Great Britain are either not cultivatecl, or are inefficiently tilled, and the land should therefore be taken over at once.III. District Reports.London and South-Eastern.This area remains quiet, though two small strikes have occurred over local grievances.George Stubbs addressed a meeting at Woolwich on the 21st June, the audience being chiefly composed of discharged soldiers. After a resolution of loyalty and determination to win the war had been passed, he attacked Colonel Vandeleur and Mr. Parsons for ignorance of their duties, and suggested that Government should prevent the peace meeting fixed for the 7th July, at which Mr. Ramsay Macdonald is to speak.South-Western.No unrest is reported, but a meeting was held at Plymouth to express sympathy with workers at Rosyth. -
West Midlands.There is no unrest except at Austin&apos;s Motor Works, near Birmingham, where feeling is very bitter. There are disputes about the price paid for turning American shells, and about the transfer of certain workers to piece rates from daily rates plus bonus. Sir Herbert Austin has twice refused to meet the workmen, and has given notice to Dingley and two others. Dingley has visited Coventry, and is likely to obtain sympathy. The Ministry of Munitions have sent a Commission to examine the whole situation at the works.Yorkshire and East Midlands.Considerable political and industrial activity are noted during the past week, but there is no serious unrest.A strong pacifist element was present at the Women&apos;s Co-operative Guild Con-gress at Bradford. At a meeting in Mansfield a resolution was passed on the right of free speech, with reference to the imprisonment of R. Farrow. Propaganda for Labour representatives is being pushed in Nottingham and Sheffield. A meeting arranged by the Women&apos;s Peace League took place at Leicester on the 19th June.At Nottingham the South Notts Farmers&apos; Union protested against the con-stitution of the Central Board and the payment of full wages to boys of 18. The electricians in corporation employ are claiming the 12^ per cent, bonus, which cannot be paid as the department is making no profit. The raising of rents, as a result of higher rates, is causing trouble among-workmen.In Sheffield the system of company piece work, introduced by Cammell Lairds some months ago, is arousing interest.Lord Leverhulme&apos;s speech at Bailey on shorter hours is being much discussed in Leeds, where textile workers think the proposal unsuited to present conditions in their trade. Engineers, who have for several weeks been demanding shorter hours and an increase of 2s. a week, approve.The A.S.E. and allied trades at Bradford have agreed with their employers to the one-break system and a 50 hours week with overtime, to continue till a national or general agreement is arrived at to cancel it.Following the adA^ance allowed to members of the Amalgamated Society of Stuff and Woollen Warehousemen, an agitation has been started by weavers in the West Riding for an advance and a 48 hours week. At many mills in Bradford the operatives refuse to work on Saturdays.North-Western.Unrest still continues.Work was resumed on the 24th June at the Gorse and Lilac Mills, and the arrangements for arbitration are held by the men as a triumph, since Govern-ment had negotiated while the men were still out.Builders, at Liverpool have not agreed to the proposal that the rate of Is. Qd. per hour should include the 12^ per cent, bonus.In Cammell Lairds&apos; yards there are complaints about the system of premium bonus and the refusal to extend to the new yard the 47 hours week in force in the old vard.The timekeepers, storekeepers, and stock-clerks of the Mersey Dockboard are on strike for higher wages and shorter hours.The Mersey Reconstruction Committee (shop stewards) has decided to call mass meetings &quot;in every shop while awards are being discussed, and district mass meetings to consider whether awards should be approved after they are promulgated.At Barrow the War Munitions Volunteers scheme has been denounced by the shop stewards as industrial conscription.Northern.Factories and shipyards on the Tyne are taking a&apos;holiday this week. A strike of boilermakers is threatened as the &quot;Nod men&quot; (employed on odd jobs where piece work cannot be fixed) were not included in the recent award.South Wales.The situation is generally peaceful. Cardiff Corporation workers are still on strike.
Scotland,Unrest has increased. At Rosyth the dockyard workmen came out for higher rates, arid a &quot; Forth Workers &quot; movement is suspected rather than the trade unions.There is a good deal of agitation at Beardmore&apos;s (Glasgow) among both munition volunteers and the female employees.Bakers in many parts of Scotland are still claiming higher wages and better conditions.IV. Disputes. (a.) Involving a Stoppage of Work.No serious strike is now continuing.The Shipyard Labour Departmentreports seven new cases, involving 1,472 men, while 15 remain from last week.  In 22 cases work has been resumed.Between 200 and 800 electricians employed by Johnson and Phillips in the London area struck as a protest against the conduct of the chief electrician towards a foreman and the shop stewards.The Ministry of Munitions reports strikes involving 8,458 workpeople during the week ending the 19th June.About 2,000 men struck at Messrs. Vauxhall Motors (Luton) because the firm refused to meet a deputation of the whole shop on a matter affecting only coachbuilders.After a conference at the Ministry of Munitions, it was decided that the grievances at the Lilac and Gorse Mills should be remitted to arbitration.The War Office, Contracts Department reports only one new stoppage in the leather trade at Walsall over the recognition of a new federation. The Coal Controllers report includes 14 new stoppages.Of -these, nine, involving nearly 9,000 men, occurred in Yorkshire and East Midlands, owing to miscellaneous grievances.(b.) Not Involving a Stoppage of Work.The Shipyard Labour Department reports 53 new and 87 old cases. During the week 34 cases were settled.The dispute about employment of sheet metal workers instead of plumbers on heating installations on the Tyne has been settled by the exclusion of the former.The Ministry of Munitions reports that criticisms of the new War Munitions Volunteers scheme are being made, chiefly on the ground that compulsion is involved.Workers engaged on manufacture and repair of colliery machinery are excited because skilled mechanics in colleries are not exempt from military service. They are refusing to repair machinery,, thus displaying their sympathy with the mechanics. .The dilution dispute in jute mills at Dundee is not settled.The War Office Contracts Department reports two new cases of claims for increased rates.The Coal Controller on the 25th June explained the offer regarding wages to the Miners&apos; Association.  It was not accepted and will be further considered.The Committee on Production heard 54 cases last week, 37 being in London and 17 in Scotland. ...The Chief Industrial Commissioner reports 184 cases, of which 63 fell in the engineering, shipbuilding, and other metal trades and 20 in the transport trade.G.
