3. 313These transferred ships while representing additional tonnage under the British Flag do not represent additional tonnage for service as the ships were already engaged inrAllied service, 6.     COAL POSITION.The general supply of coal for export has improved and good progress has been made with the shipment of coal to Italy.   It is hoped no that the 90,000 tons arrears, which had accumulated on the Italian programme last month, will be made good, and the full Italian programme of 600,000 tons covered for this month.With regard to extra supplies to France, the position at the French port3 remains the same, namely, that they cannot deal with larger quantities than have been shipped lately.   The main cause of the difficulty is the shortage of trucks, and this has been the subject of con-sideration by the Shipping Controller and General Nash.A recent telegram indicates an improvement in the position at Rouen, and steps are being taken to increase ship-ments to that port.ti7*     STORES FOR THE BRITISH ARMY IN FRANCE.In the week ending .22nd June 163,517 tons of
4.military stores were discharged in Prance,CONVEYANCE OF CZECHOSLOVAK TROOPS. _Tonnage has been definitely allocated for the con- -veyance of troops from Vladivostok to Vancouver en route to France, between July and September, and negotiations are proceeding for the use of 3 vessels on Canadian Registry which could leave Vladivostock during August and September for the conveyance of additional troops.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant, (Sd).
