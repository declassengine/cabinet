C M&apos;3L)WL/LLf June zzy 1918).1&apos;OKEIGN OFFICE-GEPMANY/008.MEMORANDUMonSPEECH BY THE GERMAN EMPEROR ON THE OCCASION OF THE THIRTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS ACCESSION-ATTACK ON THE &quot;ANGLO-SAXON&quot; IDQLATIRY OP MAIION,3)be German Emperor spent the thirtieth anniversary of his aooesBion to the throne (June 15th, 1888) with the Orown Prince and Prince Henry of Prussia at Main Headouarters. Field-Marshal von Hindenburg, in congratulating the Emperor on behalf of the army, extolled the wisdom with which be had promoted peace during the first twenty-six years of his reign and the brilliant progress of Germany during that period under His Majesty&apos;s influence.The Emperor in his reply said that the twenty-six years of peace had represented profitable but hard work, although they could not be regarded as having been c-lways successful in a political sense and although they had brought disappointraents.. His interests had been centred in work connected with the army and its development, and in the effort to maintain it at the level at which it had been handed over to him.The Kaiser continued:-&quot;As in peace time, in the preparation of my army for war, my grandfather1s war comrades gradually passed away, and as Germany&apos;s horizon gradually darkened, many a German, and not lease&quot; I assuredly, hoped that God would in this danger plaoe the right men at our side.     Our hope has not been disappointed.     In your Excellenoy and^in you, General (Ludendorff), heaven has bestowed upon the German Empire, the German Army, and our General Staff, those men who are called upon in these great times to lead the German people in arms in its decisive struggle for existence and for the right to live, and, with its help, to gain the. victory.&quot;clearly realised the trials which this war would bring,     TheHe emphasised the fact that from the first he had
first outburst of enthusiasm had. not deceived him;   the inter-vention of Great Britain had meant a world struggle, whether that had been intended or not.     It was not a matter of a strategic campaign, but g struggle between two world-views which were wrestling with each other.     Either the German principles, right, freedom, honour and morality, must be upheld, or the Anglo-Saxon principles \.ith the idolatry of Mammon must be victorious.     The Anglo-Saxons aimed at making the peoples 01 the world work as slaves for the ruling Anglo-Saxon race.     Such a matter could not be decided in days or weoks, or oven in a year.     He thanked Heaven that it had placed Irield-Marshal von Hindenburg and General Ludendorff as Councillors at his side.     The Kaiser concluded by saying&quot;The German people and Army are indeed now one and the same, and look up to you with full gratitude, I need not say.     Every man out there knows what he is fighting for. The enemy himself admits that.     And in consequence we shall gain victory, the victory ox the German standpoint. That is what is in question&quot;.On the same day the Emperor replied to a eongratu-latory telegram from the Chancellor, Count Hertling, in the course of which he said;&quot;I know that Prussian militarism, so much abused by the enemy, which my forefathers and I, in a spirit of duti-fulness, order, loyalty and obedience, have nurtured, has given the German sword and the German nation strength to triumph, and that victory will bring a peace which will guarantee German life.     It will then b? my sacred duty, as well as the State&apos;s, with all our power, to see to the healing of all the wounds which the war has caused, and to secure a healthy and happy future for the nation.&quot;The Emperor&apos;s reference to &quot;Anglo-Saxon principleswith the idolatry of Mammon&quot; has evoked comment both in Germanyand in France.(1)The Frankfurter Zeitung     says;-^(1)   Presumably Monday, June 17.    The passage quoted was telegraphed from Amsterdam on Tuesday, June 8.     The issue of the 17th has not yet (June 21) arrived.
&quot;The German people was not told on Aug.4, 1914, that it was going out to fight against a certain view of life until this was unconditionally conquered.     If that had been said, even in the most veiled form, the unity of will of the German nation would have been torn to pieces the very first day..   Further, it must be said that there is something very revolting in attributing to two whole nations certain views oi life.    We dispute that people should be expected to interpret the limitless misery of this war in such a manner.     It is too astounding that the Emperor should pick out the English from all &quot;his enemies as speoial-ly despicable in their views of life.    he has been often enough to England, and has not seldom given free expression to his sympathies for English life.&quot;The Temps (June 19th) saysl*-&quot;William II has found many insulting expressions in the vocabulary of the German Fatherland League and be is only too anxious to repeat them.     He insults the English by saying that they worship Mammon.    lie insults the Americans at the same time when he says that the Anglo-Saxons wish to inaugurate a Government of slave-owners and to reduce all other nations to slavery.    These grotesque insults sully only the man who makes them-&quot;Do the English put money above everything when they have in a body lgft their rich domains and their commercial prosperity to die on the fields of France in the uniform of private soldiers?    Do these Americans -seek to enslave other nations when they can peacefully impose their will on one half of the world and are sending here the flower of their youth to defend the liberty of all nations?    Even the Kuiser himself, although his generals have forbidden him to think, can hardly imagine that he would injure Great Britain or the United States by insulting them in thfcs way.    What is his object then?   Is it to make people forget that he is Queen Victoria&apos;s grandson?   In that oase he has succeeded.&quot;
