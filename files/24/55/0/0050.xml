I CONTROL OF WHOLESALE MILK TRADE.MEMORANDUM   BY THk MINISTRY OF   FOOD.The decision to control the wholesale milk trade was taken lith the unanimous approval of the Agricultural Advisory Committee, ?n which are represented the loading agricultural organisations )f Great Britain.   Mr. Prothero has written expressing his concurrence with the principle of control. No proposal has been made to purchase any of the businesses affected, nor has any decision been reached on the advisability of taking options.There would, therefore, seem no useful purpose to fce ssrved in discussing the principle of control, on which agreement has been reached, or the question of purchase, which has never been In . contemplation by the Ministry.   The method of control ip, moreover, sufficiently indicated in the report sent to Lord Rhondda by Major Astor&apos;s Committee, -It has always been my intention ( and I welcome Mr. Prothere!s suggestion) to refer to a smaJLl Committee of men of financial and administrative experience the financial questions directly and., indirectly arising out of control. This reference will, I hope, sufficiently meet Mr. Prothero&apos;s wishes.MINISTRY OF FOOD.J.R. CLYNES.25th June 1918.&quot;
