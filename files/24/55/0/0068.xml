VOLUHT^SRS; SPECIAL SERVICE.Koto by tho Minister of National Service,&apos;The War Office has decided to invite upwards of 15,000 volunteers to offer themselves for whole time service for a period of not less than two months&apos;, and not exceeding three months,     The invitation is addressed to*-(a) boys between 17 and 18, and(b) Grade 2 men over 35.Arrangements are to be made to inform Tribunals that exemoted men who undertake whole time service are not thereby to be prejudiced in their applications for renewal of exemption-&apos; and that the period of their volunteer service is not to be counted as part of the exemption period.     I have pointed out to the !7ar Office that not only will the recruitment of such men for the Regular Forces be delayed, but that the repercussive effect upon Tribunals in grant inn, exemption will be serious and that the extent of the effect upon recruiting cannot be estimated, I have further informed the TTar Office that the loss of recruits arising directly and indirectly must be borne by the Army and not by the Navy or the Air Force,26/6/18.
