Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland.

FOOD PRODUCTION SCHEMES, IRELAND.

Memorandum prepared in compliance with Chief Secretary&apos;s Minute of 17th March, 1917.

Week ended 26th June, 1918.

The following is a brief statement on the work of the ?partment during the past week in furtherance of increased Food Production in Ireland:-

LOANS FOR AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS.

One hundred and thirty four applications for loans for agricultural implements were received by the Department during the past week. The total value of machinery ordered from the beginning of the present year, to date, under the Scheme, amounts to ?40,801.

PROGRESS OF CROPS.

The weather during the week continued to be somewhat cold And showery, but, except that the cutting of meadow  hay was delayed ?n some counties, conditions were favourable on the whole to ?egotation and farm operations.   Root crops benefited considerably by ?ains, but turnips have not in all cases recovered from the effects ?f the dry weather at seeding time. Grain crops are making very good growth, and it is interesting to note that the temporary check, ?n cereal growth caused by the drought of a few weeks past is considered in many instances to have proved beneficial, as very little lodging ? the crop is now anticipated. Barley appears to be the ?ost thriving grain crop and spring-sown whea? the most backward, many fields of the latter ? promising to ripen very late in the year?

DRAINAGE OF AGRICULTURAL LAND.

The Department&apos;s Drainage Scheme under Regulation 2.M. of the Defence of the Realm Regulations continues in active operation. The work which is being done consists chiefly in requiring land-?olders to cleanse the channels and repair the banks of streams and ?rains adjoining their lands where neglect, to do so is causing flood?ng of agricultural land.

Five hundred and fifty-seven applications for action by the department have been received up to the present. Twelve Inspectors are engaged in the work of inspecting and reporting tn the cases in ?ands.

During the past winter and spring it was not found expedient to put pressure upon farmers to comply immediately with the

?6/6/18.
Department&apos;s Orders. Continuous flooding in winter and the heavy spring work of sowing the crops placed difficulties in the farmers&apos; way. Measures are now being taken to enforce compliance while the season is favourable.

In several counties there is a marked disinclination and neglect to carry out the work required. Legal proceedings have been taken, and are at present pending, against some of the worst defaulters. In a few cases it is hoped that it will be found practicable to have the work executed by contract (by exercise of the Department&apos;s powers under sub-section (h) of the Regulation) and subsequently to recover from each defaulter his proportionate share Of the cost.

Notices under sub-section (i), requiring the opening of sluices at prescribed times, have been served in a few cases, but the conflicting interests involved, the neglected and broken-down condition of many weirs and sluices, and the generally ? obstructive attitude of proprietors of weirs and water-power have rendered action of this nature very difficult. In two cases alterations of weirs have been voluntarily executed by the proprietors at the Department&apos;s request.

POTATO SPRAYING.

Spraying war practised generally during the week, but main-?rop varieties are as a rule not yet ready for this operation. The ?rop is reported to be vigorous and healthy, and more advanced in growth, by same weeks, than in previous seasons. In a few districts it has suffered from want of moisture and from frosts.

There is at present a shortage of repair parts for a leading French make of hand-spraying machine (commonly used in Ireland); due to delay arising out of war conditions in delivery of the parts from France. A representative of the Department recently visited Paris in connection with this matter, and through the assistance of the Auth?rition there secured the transit of a consignment of &apos;parts&apos; to ? part of embarkation.

TURF FOR FUEL.

In view of the increasing shortage of coal, and the necessity for conserving available supplies, the Department early in the season requested County Committees of Agriculture and their staffs to impress ? farmers the probability of further grave reductions in coal supplies, and the necessity for cutting and saving increased quantities of turf, so that supplies might be available, in li?u of coal, for ?rban dwellers. It is reported that farmers and cottagers in the Neighbourhood of peat bogs have not this appeal so far as the labour at their disposal permitted, and that as a result increased quantities of turf fuel will be available for sale in towns. The labour short-? noticeable in many districts is felt particularly in connection with this operation, and the output of turf has in many place been restricted from this cause.
ARTIFICIAL MANURES.

Supplies of Basic Slag and sulphate of ammonia for current requirements are now being imported in accordance with the schemes of allocation and distribution already arranged.

INSPECTION OF HOLDINGS.

Arrangements are being made for the resumption of the general inspection of holdings, involving the defining of districts, assigning of Inspecters to districts and preparing of lists ? cases in which special inspections are necessary as well as the furnishing of maps and revised report forms, etc. to meet the requirements of the Corn Production Act, 1917.

Inspections are being made at the moment, though on a comparatively limited scale, and usually in special cases only.

FLAX.

From a summary of the returns of stocks of sowing flaxseed re?aining on merchants hands, it appears that about 13,000 bags of seed are being carried over for next season. This quantity, however, included about 5,000 bags which are not of a ?ibre-producing variety.

The Department are not yet in a position to state definitely the area actually sown with flax in Ireland in the present season. They have, however, endeavoured to estimate the areas on the basis of the quantity of seed sown, and from the figures available they consider that the area should approximate to 135,000 acres, as against 107,705 acres last year. Considerable difficulty has been experienced in ascertaining the quantities of the various classes of seed imported and the quantity of home-saved seed sown, and in determining that allowance should be made for specially heavy sowing ?n account of the poor quality of some of the old seed.   The margin of error in the above estimate may, accordingly, prove to be wider than would be the case under ordinary circumstances.

The question of putting into operation at once a scheme for the training of the large number of additional scutchers required to deal with the increased flax crop in reasonable time has been the subject of correspondence between the Departments. the Flax Control Board, ?endon, and the Flax Supplies Committee, Belfast. It is now probable that the Scheme will be administered by the last named body.

Steps are being taken to secure the thorough promulgation and ?nforcement of the Flaxseed (Ireland) Order, 1918. The requirements of the Order are being made known us widely as possible by means of ?sters, press notices and the distribution of leaflets.

A number of temporary Inspectors are being appointed to advise flaxgrowers of the provisions of the Order and to assist in its enforcement.
TRANSIT OF FARMING REQUISITES.The Department&apos;e Transit Branch have continued to deal with representations received regarding the carriage of consignments of agricultural machinery and implements and other farming requisites.MAINTENANCE OF LIVE STOCK,During the period from the 18th to 34th inst.P inclusive,,, 374 applications for licences to slaughter or export animals under the 0rd&apos;^r relating to breeding sows wero received, and 300 lioenees wer^ issuedo   During the same .period 133 applications for lioenees to expert milch cows, 147 applications for licenceo to slaughter or export heifers and 18 applications for licences to export store * heifera and strippers wivre received0   thirty-nine applications for licences te slaughter bulls or bullocks were also reoeived*
