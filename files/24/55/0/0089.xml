si 287W&amp;r Cabinet.Incidence of sickness in the British Forces in Macedoniaand East Africa,Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War,/gedical/3752. . &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;On the 23rd May, War Cabinet 4X5 (3), I undertook to make enquiries into the statistics regarding sickness at Salonika,   The following are the figures.	Admissions	Deaths	--------.............................w . Ratio per 1000 per annum.				Admissions	DeathsBnterica   1916	826	27	6.3	.211917	511	19	2.5	,09Dysentery 1916	5987	132	45.7	1,011917	5842	124	28.6	.61Diarrhoea 1916	7014	8	53.6	.061917	6568	4	32.2	.02Malaria    1916	31059	190	237.2	1.451917	71413	237	3*0.0	1.16Wounds      1916	w	**		1917	7754	597	38.0	2,93All classes 1916	128630	738	982.7	5.64Except wounds 1917	170900	737	837.7	3.61No record of wounds 1916.It will &quot;be observed that practically 100 per oent of the Force was admitted to hospital in 1916. The ratio in 1917 dropped to 83.77 per oent*The admissions to hospital under each head except malaria have dropped in 1917 from the figures of the previous year.   As regards malaria, practically the whole of the cases admitted during the past 6 months have &quot;been relapses.   Of these chronic cases 16,000 have recently &quot;been evacuated to England, and the admissions to hospital during the past 4 weeks under this head are therefore already beginning to drop viz 1884, 1329, 1310, 1197.   The malaria season is now beginning, and numbers are likely to rise as fresh cases must be expected in addition to the relapse patients.Entericaincludes typhoid fever and paratyphoids.   The ratio for this group of diseases in 1917 is very little higher than it is in Prance,Bast Africa
East Africa*British Forces in East Africa have been so scattered that no similar table to that for Salonika is available, the admissions to hospital being shown week by week as cabled. The admissions have dropped very materially since 1916, partly owing to the reduction in the size of the Force.Table A shows the first and last weeks for which the figures for British and Natives are shown separately.Table B gives the figures for the whole Ea African foroe for two weeks in 1916 and for the two corresponding weeks in 1917,The figures for the last week of which a return has been received are also shown.MILKER.29th June, 1918.
