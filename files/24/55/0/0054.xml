iftv of--^^ V/AR   CABINETRELEASE OF   AGRICULTURAL LABOUR FOR MILITARY SERVICEMemorandum from the Ministry of Food,I learn with alarm that the action of the National Service Department during the last month in calling up such a large proportion of skilled men employed in agriculture has gone far to undermine the sense of security in the Government1s agricultural policy which it had taken sixteen months to establish.The statement of the Prime Minister on 23rd February 1917 that it was essential for the safety of the nation that ire should put forth immediately every effort to increase production for this yearss harvest and the next is as true to-day as it was then. The increased demands of our Allies and the enforced concentration on a single source of importation have made the Increase of home I production essential to the maintenance of our food supplies. I am convinced that we shall run a considerable risk if the fulfilment of our promised programme is placed in jeopardy.I desire to support the suggestion put forward by Mr.ProtheroJ.R. CLYNES.26*6*18*
