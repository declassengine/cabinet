rrf^B-nr II Colonel ft Dally Jones,fpL ,p June 1318,fafi    Sir.LL(v The Japanese Ambassador called upon mo thisevening. and handed to rue a Note from-..-his-&apos;Goveraneirt in answer,,to the communication which9 in conformity with the decision of the Versailles Councils I made on the subject of Allied intervention in Russia,   A copy of the Note&apos; accompanies this recordsAs regards the part of the Note dealing with the United States, the Ambassador explained that the refusal of his Government to adopt the suggestion made at Versailles? and to express their readiness to intervene before America adopted the policy of   &apos; intervention; was due to their great anxiety not to offend American susceptibilities   He was quite aware that the policy of this country and of its Allies did not contemplate, and had never contemplated? action in Siberia without the whole-hearted co-operation of &apos;   America; but nevertheless.^ in so delicate a matter6 they thought that the course which they had adopted was the one most likely to lead to satisfactory re-suitsoI said that, so far as I was personally cca-cerned, 1 had always proceeded on the idea thab:p whilkeepingEis Excellency9The Right Honourable,Sir C, Greene, G..C.M.C-, ,;K,C,B,,C&amp;C a &amp;C.b .

keeping japan fully informed of our views, she should not be formally asked to take action until the other co-belligerents were agreed upon the pollcy.. the versailles council, however, had determined to reverse this order of procedure, while in no way modifying the end to be attained.   the question, however, was one rather of form than of substance, and., provided only we could secure common action, it matte-red little whether the final invitation came from japsai9 france, italy and great /britain to -america or from america., prance, italy and great &quot;britain to japan,I then referred to a much more important point, suggested by the final sentence in the penultimate paragraph of the japanese note,   in this passage ths japanese government expressed their regret that they could not &quot;engage to extend westward the sphere of their military activities beyond the limits of eastern siberia in view of the grave difficulties with which such operations will be practically confronted^on this 1 observed that these words might be naturally interpreted as meaning no more than that the japanese government were unwilling to pledge theirs selves to a military operation which might turn out to be beset by such serious difficulties as to be iin-possible of accomplishment, i said that, if this were aji it meant, it was not inconsistent with the policy,advocated by his &quot;majesty&apos;s government; that the alliedforce
forces should, press-their activities as far westward as the military and pall ti cal situation rendered practicable,   1 - asked his excellency whether&apos; i was justified in putting this interpretation upon the japanese no be,his excellency replied that the words of the note wore certainly open to this construction, but that he &quot;had -no-authority to say that it was the-const-ruction which his government-themselves placed upon it* speak-ing personally and unofficially, he thought it net impossible that the formula used in the note was in-tended to meet the views of those who considered &quot;thatthe japanese obligations to the entente powers were- between oreat britain and japan, that treaty based upon the ll^aty/expr^s-sly-- oontemplated the iimt-tation cf japanese military efforts to eastern theatreof war.   therefore an expedition intended to  0 farto the west lay outside the scope of any demands thatcould properly be made upon the.japanese people^apparently this view was held by a not unimportantsection of the japanese public, and, though he couldnot speak with any assurance on the subject,, he thoughit might have prompted the somewhat ambiguous formulato v/hich i had referred,i expressed in reply my most earnest hope that th.il.was not the case. i impressed upon him.not for the firtime, the extreme perils of german penetration througheuropean eus
Hussia and Western Siberia,   1 pointed out thatthis could not be effectually met by an interventionlimited to Eastern Siberia; and I added that in ouropinion operations far to the West-of-tM,.s^proviiicatextending even to the Oral Mountains and beyond,should in existing circumstances present no veryserious raiiitary difficulties,1 quoted to him some very confidential informa-tion, which 1 had just received, to the effect thatGerman efforts were being made to repeat In 1918the &quot;coup&quot; which had saved Frederick the Great atthe end of the Seven Years War, . According to this informat! on j the object of the &quot;* (German Governmentwas not merely to detach Russia from the Ententewhich they had already done with a very full measureof success -m but to convert Russia from being theirenemy to being their Ally,   If Russian man-power wereadded to the forces already controlled by the CentralPowers-, the Allies, according to this German forecastwould have no -course open to them but to lay downtheir arms,   In addition., I read to the AmbassadorMr, Woodhcuse5s telegram No0260? which presented theview of a competent observer in petrograd itself cHis Excellency quite realised: the immense im* portance which His Majestys Government attached to the views I had laid before him; and promised to tele graph them at once to his Government,
JAPAI^ HMBA3SY.Tlie Japanese Government have been always anxious to co-ordinate their policy as far as possible with the policy of the Governments with which they are associated in the war respecting the measures to he * taken to meet the exigencies of the situation in Siberia6   At the same time they hove on more than one occasion made it clear that they place particular importance on the moral and material support of the United States to any undertaking of military nature in which they may embark in Siberia,   They understand that their attitude of thus counting on the support of the United States was fully appreciated and kept in view by the Governments of Great Britain, France and Italy in formulating the proposals embodied in the memorandum which His Britannic Majesty1 s Principal&quot; Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was so good as to hand to the Japanese Ambassador in London on the 7th of June last.   Having regard, however, to the position or the Japanese Government declared in their communication to the American Government under date of the 19th of March last, they do not feel themselves at liberty to express their decision on the question of the Allied intervention now suggested, beforecomplete
complete under standing is reached between the three Powers and the United Statese   The correspondence which passed, between the Japanese and the American Governments on the subject^ v/as at that time communi-cated to the three Governments, and tho Japanese Government trust that their intention in this respect -will not be mi. sunder stood or misconstrued,,They have also carefully examined three con-ditions which.&apos;it is proposed, should be fulfilled in the event of common action being taken in. Siberia,, .and they believe it due to frankness to offer the following observations for the confidential informa-tion of the British Government in anticipation of the eventuality contemplated by the three Governments0 The principles enunciated in the first and second points of those conditions are in entire accord with the repeated declaration of the Japanese Government and are quite acceptable to them,   With regard to the third condition requiring the Allied expedition v to advance as far West as possible, the Japanese Government in full sympathy with the object, which it is sought thereby to attain^ has submitted the question to their most serious consideration,   They regret that they should find it impossible for them to engage to extend westward the sphere of their military activities beyond the limits of Eastern Siberia in view of the grave difficulties with which suchop orat!ons
bper^lons wilLJx? -pmctioally --confronted^The&quot;Japanese Government further desire to point out that they attach great importance to the unity of command in case common, action is taken in -Siberia.   Considering the geographical position of Japan as well as the strength of military forces which she will be called upon&apos;to employ for the proposed undertakingv the- Japanese Government feel themselves justified in expressing the hope that supreme command of the whole international con-tingents in Siberia be placed in the hands of Japan,-June 24th, 1918,
