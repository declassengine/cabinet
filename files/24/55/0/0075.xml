(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE gRQggRTY OP HIS gUTAMIC MAgSTY^S OOVi&amp;TOiiNT)23883CBU WAR   CABIH3T.1G.T. 4974.CALLING   UP   MEN   FOR   THE AKMY. Memorandum by Mr. A. Chamberlain.In the course of Cabinet discussion, War Cabinet 436, Janute 14, on iibcemption of Men employed in certain industries, I mentioned the representations which had reached me from both employers and workmen in Birmingham as to the ill-feeling caused by the retention of young men in munition factories. I do not in the least wish to under-rate the real and effective effort which the Ministry of Munitions is making to release the younger men, but I think I ought to bring to the notice of the Cabinet the following extract from a letter just re-ceived from the Clerk to the Birmingham Local Tribunal;-&quot;I have the honour to inform you that at a General Meeting of the Birmingham Local Tribunal held this morning, the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor, Sir David Brooks, G.B.E. presiding, the reply of the Minister of National Service to my letter of the 6th instant, a copy of which was forwarded to the Board, was considered.   The Minister, in such reply, states &quot;that the quota of men whom it was considered possible to withdraw from the manufacture of munitions of &apos;*ar, was fixed by the War Cabinet and that the quota which is being released Was considered the maximum which could be made available with-6ut interfering with the output of Munitions.&quot;There is a very strong feeling in Birmingham that the calling up of men between the age3 of 43 and 50 cannot be justified while a considerable numoer of young men are permitted to remain^in the^rfluuitTDn factories,*, The Tribunal Would be glad of an assurance that all the young men made available by (l) the clean cut, (2) the several Proclamations  nd (3) the revision of U.M. 130 have actually been secured to the Army.&apos;I believe that this difficulty would be got over if i the Ministry of Munitions and the Admiralty would consent to have their men sent before the Tribunals in the ordinary way. I do not think that the Tribunals would be unreasonable in considering the special case which these Departments would have to make, and it would always be possible to adopt the suggestion thrown out by the Prime Minister that if essential men were called up they should be lent by the Army to the Departments which require their services.(Intd)   A.C.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. June 2Sth, 1916.
