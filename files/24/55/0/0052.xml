GENERAL RESUME CP R,A,F. NAVAL CONTINGENT OPERATIONS JUNE 4th * 17th INCLUSIVE,1910.Low clouds and high winds have restricted operations during the week though full advantage has been taken of the favourable intervals.Enemy activity has boon bolow normal and his patrol machines have not ventured far from their bases.   Enemy submarines have been active, especially in the North Sea,   A bombing raid on Dunkirk on the 9th instant resulted in tho loss of one Handley Pago machine and  . ono other machine damaged;   this raid also prevented our bombing   &apos; machines from operating that night,* Bombing squadrons from Dunkirk dropped over 34 tons of bombs on Zecbrugge, Ostend, Thourout and enemy coast batteries and aircraft bases in Belguim,   Spotting for monitoi3 bombarding fteebruggo was carried out;   13 submarines were sighted and 7 attacked by aircraft. 12 mines were sighted and 6 destroyed, the others being reported to surface craft for destruction.   Enemy aircraft were engaged on several occasions and 2 were destroyed.   One Handley Pago was destroyed by gun-fire,Routine Patrols and Escorts have been carried out wheneverpossible,FOREIGN STATIONS.British machines attacked CATTARO on the 13th June,    Two machines were damaged but all returned,SjggaRY OF THE SITUATION, T^estorn Front),During the past three weeks two points of interest stand out in a prominent manner,1, Accommodation in existing aerodromes has been INCREASEDboth in the Lille and the Northern portion of the Lens Sectors, new aerodrome3 have been formed which the enemy has endeavoured to conceal and new landing grounds have been prepared in the Lille Sector, The ^replacement of tent hangars by sheds of a more permanent type has been carried out in the Flanders and Lille Sectors,The&apos;Somme Battle Front with the exception&apos;of tho area immediately S, of Peronne, shows a general DECREASE,2, The aerial forces which were employed during tho SommeBattle have to a great extent boon moved down to the Champagne Battle Area, and no replacement,of the Somme Units has taken place,     A perpetual exchange has, however, existed between the Somme and the Lys&quot;forces, whereby the latter havo been kept up to the same strength as that maintained during the Lys Battle,   In addition, one of the bombing squadrons has now been transferred from the St,Quontin Sector to the Lys Sector.From the above.summary of the situation, it would appear likely that the enemy will continue to carry out operations in the present area, and that an attack on the Amiens front will not now take place,-  Present indications point to an offensive being launched in the Lille-Lens Sector,   In this area, however, there is not, as yet that reconnaissance and scout activity which would precede tho opening of an offensive operation.
Asia Lllnor.i&quot;t&quot; is rooortcd that a flight (presumably Turkish) loft Bozanti for the South.Information received states that there is an INCREASE in military activity in the Aegean zono, and that tho enemy air forcos have &quot;been augmented and reconnaissances have been carried out ovor Tenodos -nd tho other occupied islands.Palest inc.Brorn Information received it -would appear that the onemy has apparently received reinforcements in aeroplanes; there is an Increased accommodation at JENIN aerodrome   This may relate to the Turkish (?) Company passing through Bozanti.Turkestan.It is reported that there arc 10 acroplanos at TABIIKKND, 4 at SOMARCAND, whilst 5 aeroplanes have boon sent to KUSIUC.ENEMY SEAPLANE ACTIVITY.North Sea,Gorman seaplanes In tho North Sea have latoly shown considerable activity.Borkem Seaplane Station, besides carrying out patrols to tho North and South Dogger Bank Lightships, has sent out strong reconnaissance accompanied by fighter escort on the Dutch Coast Patrol.   On ihe 4th June one of our patrols was attacked by as many as 10 machines North of Terscholling Island.Zeebrugge Station has continued to send out strong formations to our Eastern Coast.Black So&amp;,.,&quot;Tilero Is evidence of activity at the German Seaplane Station at Scbastopol, which appears to be supplied with machines from Constanza. There are indications of a revival of activity at Varna Seaplane Station.ITEMS OF GENERAL INTEREST.Gonoral.Two interesting documents have been obtained during the past week which bring out the following points1, The great importance attached by the enemy to an efficientliaison between tho infantry and aircraft during an offensive.2, The method of sending up supplies to S.A.A. rationsetc. to isolated parties, by the use of baskets attached to parachuteswhich are dropped from aeroplanes.During the Somme Battle (21.3.18) documentary and prisoners&apos; ovidenco showed that Pursuit Plights were being grouped in Scuadrons of four flights 0   It now appears that the same methods of grouping Protective Plights in squadrons is being carried out.Satisfactory evidence continues to come to hand regarding heavy casualties inflicted on the enemy by our bombing machines.New types of enemy ma chine s (Germany).It has been reported by a prisoner that a new single-seater fighter, rotary engine, has been produced but that it will not be used on the front for two er three months,
tA new Rumplor two-seater had boon reported with a fuel capacity of over 6 hours.     Its possible use as r.n escort in long distance day raids is suggested.It is confirmed that a new typo of Gotha (G,7.) is said to be under manufacture which is Intended for daylight raids. The chiof featuro of this machine is its high ceiling (23,000 feet) and tow of only too persons, Tho bomb&apos; load Is said to be loss than the present type,A new Brandenburg seaplane with a 200 h,p, Benz motor is stated to be ready for issue shortly.   It has an air endurance of 5-1 hours and is armed with two fixed machine guns and one moveablo machine gun.Austria.A prisoner of war reports that the Austriana have a new Phoenix two-seater reconnaissance machine which will shortly appear.   It is said to have a speed of 120 m,p,h. and a celling of 23,000 foot.21,6,1,8
