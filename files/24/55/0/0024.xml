Colonel I. Dally Jones, j qSECRIlIT.MINISTKY  OF   FOOD.Report for Week ending Wednesday, June 19, 1918.PART I. ACTION TAKEN.On the anniversary of Lord Rhondda&apos;s assumption of office as Food Controller&apos; Mr. Clynes made a statement upon the food situation to a meeting of Press representa-tives. He remarked upon the absence of complaints from organised labour. So quick had been the change in the last year that the talk of strikes and revolutions had entirely passed away and trade union conferences ended without a reference to food. He expressed the view that the community would never again have to endure such a period of trial as led to the queues of last winter, and paid a warm tribute to the assistance of America that had so greatlv lightened the task of the Ministry of Food.Great regret was expressed at the absence of Lord Rhondda and universal sympathy with him in his severe illness.Control of Supplies.Allied Requirements. Mr. Hoover has accepted the invitation extended through Lord Reading to be the guest of His Majesty&apos;s Government during his forthcoming stay in England. It is expected that Mr. Hoover will arrive towards the end of July and will only remain about a fortnight in Europe, during which period he hopes to have conferences with the Allied Food Controllers.Dr. Alonzo Taylor, of the United States Food Administration, who is expected in London within a week or so, has cabled to Mr. Sheldon that the United States is &quot; long &quot; on pork in all forms and &quot; short &quot; on beef, and that under these circumstances the Allies should be urged to increase their importations of pork and to limit their importations of beef. Dr. Taylor adds that the consumption of pork is being forced in the United States and that of beef repressed.In reference to the representations made as to the condition of bacon arriving from North America for this country, Sir Guy Granet cables that cars containing meat are being re-iced when necessary, and. that the question of packers guaranteeing against taint is receiving his urgent attention. He points out that a considerable portion of the May and June purchases were from United States packers who had not formerly engaged in the export trade. These firms have been notified through the United States Food Administrations that further purchases will be discontinued. Their stocks of meats have now all been practically shipped. Inspectors working under Sir Guy Granefs instructions are exercising every precaution to assure the proper condition of bacon and hams on their arrival in England.Sir Guy Granet reports that the United States Food Administration have now adopted an allotment plan for the purchase of butter and cheese in co-operation with the Allied Provisions Export Commission. He hoped it would be possible to complete the remaining requirements of butter by the end of July, but feared it might take considerably longer to complete the purchase of requirements of cheese. The Treasury have authorised the purchase in June and July of an additional 2,000 tons of butter at a cost not to exceed $2,000,000.Bacon and Hams. The position at the Liverpool quays demands constant attention. In order that clearances may keep pace with arrivals it has been arranged for special trains to bring certain cargoes en bloc to London. The further employment of coasting steamers to Bristol, and from Hull to London, is also under consideration.Butter. A further purchase of 73 tons of butter at 42-1 to 42-g- cents per pound, f.a.s., New York, has been made in the United States of America. During the week ending 15th June, 959 tons of butter arrived in this country, 8,516 tons were on passage, and the stocks in hand amounted to 18,334 tons.A special distribution of butter is being made to enable the ration to be raised to 5 ozs. in those districts where local supplies are not sufficient to provide it.A  (33)5875-3  Pk 1   100  6/18   E&amp;S A
Cereals. The Wheat Commission, with the approval of the Treasury, have sanctioned the expenditure of a further sum of 40,0001. on the erection of additional machinery for protecting their stocks of wheat in Australia, if affected with weevil.Cheese. Advice lias been received of shipments of 2,136 tons of cheese from New Zealand, 2,274 tons from Canada, and 1,257 tons from the United States of America; 2,832 tons, have arrived from New Zealand, 949 tons from Canada, and 1,514 tons from the United States of America, where the unshipped stock amounts to 3,632 tons ; in New Zealand 25,772 tons remain unshipped ; the total quantity now on passage amounts to 12,178 tons.Fish. The Canned Salmon (Returns) Order, dated 12tli June 1918, requires every person in Great Britain who has in his custody 50 cases or more of tinned salmon to furnish a return to the Food Controller giving particulars thereof.Fish distribution officers have been appointed by Divisional Fish Commissioners in following areas : N.E. (with Hull as operating centre). N.M. (with Grimsby as operating centre). London (with Billingsgate as operating centre). Home Counties (with General Fishing Ports as operating centre). . S.W. (with Plymouth as operating centre). E. (with Yarmouth and Lowestoft as operating centre). Scotland, W. (West Coast of Scotland).Fruit.-The Soft Fruit (Sales) Order, 1918, dated 14th June, 1918, provides that no one shall take delivery in the United Kingdom except under licence of imported soft fruit, i.e., currants, strawberries and raspberries. Growers who have more than 1 cwt. of such fruit may only sell to a licensed jam manufacturer, or to a person under licence to buy. The maximum price is fixed, at which the grower may sell in the United Kingdom, while additions may be made for packing and delivery. The dealers&apos; profit or commission on any sale must not exceed the growers&apos; price by more than 30s. per ton. Sales by retail of 5 lbs. or less are unrestricted as to price. All contracts subsisting on June 17 for the sale of soft fruit grown or to be delivered in the United Kingdom are cancelled.The stone fruit which appeared to set fairly well during the blossoming period has now mostly disappeared owing to lack of fertilisation, and the prospect is the worst experienced for many years. In Kent the crop is believed to be an entire failure. It is a little better in the Wisbech district, and there is possibly a half-crop in the Evesham and Worcestershire district, of egg plums. At the same time, damsons are almost a complete failure, and the apple crop in the west of England is also extremely small and no large quantity of fruit can be looked for from this source.Meat.-During the past week the number of sheep sent into market has markedly increased; the beasts arriving from Ireland have also been numerous, so that a smaller amount of frozen, meat was required to meet the ration than had been anticipated. From the point of view of control this has been a disadvantage in a certain measure, as it has delayed the disposal of the stocks of inferior qualitv beef; the amount of this beef that has had to be condemned, and the allowances which have-to be made on it to retailers, will have an appreciable effect on the financial results of the. purchases made in North America; arrangements have been made for the purchases made on civilian account to be reduced during the next few months, as the stocks in store are still large, and there is little doubt that the supplies will be ample to maintain the present ration, and even perhaps to increase it in the middle of July. Arrangements are being made for beef sausages to be sold with fewer restrictions, and it has been possible to make more concessions with regard to the sale of these and other miscellaneous meats than at one time appeared probable.Milk. Mr. Clynes stated in the House of Commons that the decision to control the wholesale milk trade had been taken with the unanimous approval of the Agricultural Advisory Committee, on which are represented the leading agricultural organisations of Great Britain. Mr. Prothero has written expressing his concurrence with the principle of control. No proposal has been made to purchase any of the businesses affected, nor has any decision been reached on the advisability of taking options.The attention of the Department has been called to the [report of a Committee recently appointed by , the Mayor of New York, in which City retailers of milk are licensed, and the license shows the grade of milk which they sell,   When the grading
o  milk in New York City was inaugurated on 1st January 1912, 40 per cent, of the supply was put into grade C, which roughly corresponds with the general supply of English milk, whereas in July 1914 the amount of grade C milk sold in New York City had become negligible. This result has been achieved because the dealers had to publish on their licences the fact that the milk they sold was placed in grade G, and therefore they endeavoured immediately to remove the unsatisfactory conditions which caused the contamination of their supplies. It appears that at Infant-Milk depots where clean milk is supplied the death rate for infants under one year is 42 per thousand, while the rate for children of the same age in the entire city is 93.Oils and Fats. The Home Melt Tallows and Greases (Requisition) Order, 1918, dated 12th June 1918, requires the occupier of every factory or workshop engaged in the rendering, melting, and treating of raw beef or mutton fat, or otherwise in the production of home melt tallows and greases from such fats; to hold his stock on the 29th June and his future output at the disposal of the Food Controller.Home Melt Tallow and Grease (Maximum Prices) Order, 1918, dated 12th June 1918, fixes maximum wholesale and retail prices for edible bone-fat and dripping, and various tallows and greases manufactured from raw beef and mutton fat and bones.The Raw Beef and Mutton Fat (Licensing&apos;of Purchases) Order, dated 12th June 1918, provides that no one shall, except under licence, buy, melt, or treat such-yfat. No licence is required in respect of fats acquired for human consumption, or for the manufacture of meat products other than dripping, or by butchers in the ordinary course of their trade.Organised Distribution.District Reports. The Commissioner for the Midland Division advocates the minimum number of labour representatives on the Committees being raised from one to three in urban districts having a population of 20,000 and over, and from one&apos; to two in all other districts.* The Commissioner for the North Western Division reports that it is becoming no uncommon occurrence for Trade and Labour Councils to pass resolutions of thanks at their meetings, to the Ministry of Food, for their efforts.The Commissioner for the Home Counties reports that almost all difficulties with regard to labour representation on the Committees have been satisfactorily settled, and that the Committees are working well.The Commissioner for the Northern Division has arranged for Committees in rural areas to send butter, for which there is no local sale, to a centre in Newcastle, whence it is distributed to places where there is a demand. The scheme came into operation on the 22nd of May, and since that date 1,9531- ^JS* 0^ butter have been sold, at a total value of 2191. 15s. b%d. -The Food Control Committee for Birmingham are prepared to organise the collection of surplus fruit in the Birmingham District, and to manufacture as much as 45,000 lbs. of jam for sale in the national kitchens established in the city of Birmingham.Holiday Arrangements. Instructions have been issued to Food Commissioners, under which they will decide the additional quantities of meat, bacon,and margarine required for holiday periods, and Food Control Committees will allocate these supplies among retailers, taking into consideration the.additional requirements of caterers and establishments. Committees will issue supplementary authorities to retailers for additional supplies of sugar for visitors staying a week or more. It is not proposed at present to make any special arrangements for additional supplies of tea, butter, cheese, jam, or lard.Supplementary Rationing. In view of - the reports from Representative Food Control Committees.which show a substantial majority in favour of the continuance of the Supplementary Rationing Scheme, the Consumers&apos; Council have approved the carrying on of the scheme. Fresh instructions, and a revised classified list for the guidance of Committees are in preparation. The Ministry have under consideration a proposal to reduce the list of participants slightly, by the exclusion of some of the lighter manual trades.The returns received from 95 per cent, of the Food Control Committees of Great Britain, show that the number of cards issued to women and girls was 65,548, hut this number gives very little indication of the proportion of the female population engaged on heavy work. Less than 200,000 cards have been issued to adolescent hoys, whereas over 1,600,000 boys are entitled to receive cards. *
PART II.-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.The decrease in imports during the current week may be regarded as the result of the large increases which have attracted attention in previous weeks.It will be observed that the diminished consumption of home-fed meat still continues, a tendency which promises well for the future numbers of live stock.Imports.Imports of food for the week ended June 15th were the smallest for any week since the week ending March 30th (Table A). The total quantity of principal foods and feeding-stuffs received, 168,500 tons, was 58,000 tons lower than in the previous week, and almost exactly half the total for the week ending June 16th, 1917. With the exception of wheat and flour, cheese and tea, all the items showed declines on the week before. The most important fall- -though not the most marked, which was in oats was in sugar, from&apos;26,500 tons to 13,200 tons. Figures of sugar for recent weeks are shown in tabular form below. Wheat and flour in equivalent grain totalled 108,500 tons, an increase on the week before of 4,000 tons ; but, as against arrivals a year before, there was a decrease amounting to 91,900 tons. Other cereals all heavily declined ; the aggregate was only 19,800 tons, of which 11,700 tons was oats.   Maize arrivals were the lowest this year.Consignments of cheese were not unsatisfactory, and but slightly below the figure for the corresponding week a year ago. Lard arrivals were again heavy ; the total for the first 24 weeks of this year is, however, still 7,300 tons below the total for the corresponding period of 1917.Both bacon and hams and butchers&apos; meat fell considerably on the week, the former from 23,500 tons to 17,600 tons, the latter from 12,500 tons to 8,700 tons. A comparison of the last four weeks with 1917 is given in the following table : week ending i	sugar.-		meat (including beef, mutton, and meat unenuni crated).		1 bacon and hams.  &apos;		v pj18.	1017.	1918.	1917.	1918.	1917.May 25th.....

The average fine for Ireland, 6s. Sd., showing a decrease in the former, and an increase in the latter case.The greatest number of prosecutions were again in the Home Counties and London Divisions, with 1.22 and 78 prosecutions respectively. Five Divisions obtained a hundred, per cent, of convictions this week: Newcastle, Nottingham, Birmingham, Bristol, and Inverness; while the percentage for the Home Counties was only 89 as against 93 in the previous week.Prosecutions in connection with the Tea (Prices) Order and the Horses (Rationing) Order showed a marked increase, 73 with the one and 30 with the other. Prosecutions in connection with the Meat (Rationing) Order on the other hand were less by 87, only 40 cases being recorded this week.Profiteering. At Kingston-on-Hill, F. Gregory, wholesaler, was fined 501. or three months&apos; imprisonment for failing to keep accurate records of sales of bacon. The defendant was lately lined 100Z. at Hull for imposing excessive charges.G. Channell, butcher, was fined 501. at Hampstead for selling silverside of beef above the maximum price.   This was his third offence.Errata in last-week&apos;s Report On page 4, line 10, for &quot; gallons &quot; read &quot;pints.&quot; On page 5, line 8, for &quot; months &quot; read &quot; days.&quot;
IllConsumption.Meat.--The quantity of home-fed meat entering the Central Market, London, and the markets at Manchester, Glasgow, and Liverpool was only 967 tons during the week ended June 8th, a decline of 22 per cent, on the previous week and of 72 per cent, on the corresponding week of last year (Table B). During the past four weeks the falling off has been in all nearly 56 per cent.The supply of foreign meat, 4,420 tons, at the four markets was slightly lower than that in the week before, but was 1,134 tons, or 35 per cent., above the supply.a year before.Taking both kinds, home and foreign, together, there was a fall of 6 per cent, as compared with the week ended June 1st, 1918, and of 20 per cent, as compared with the week ended June 9th, 1917.For the week ended June 15th, 1918, at the Central Market, London, both home and imported supplies increased by 73 tons, the former from 505 tons to 578 tons, the latter from 3,736 tons to 3,809 tons. Of the total 87 per cent, was imported against 88 per cent, in the week before.Table C illustrating the supplies of fat cattle and sheep has been modified to include figures for 1916. For the week ended June 8th the number of cattle at the markets fell 17 per cent, and the number of sheep rose 20 per cent.Provisions. The returns from a large number of co-operative stores and multiple shops of sales in&apos; the four weeks ended June 8th, 1918, may be summarised as follows : Commodity,	Sales : Pour Weeks ending			June 8th, 1918.

Cheese has recovered from the heavy fall of last month, but sales are less than half those of last year. The fall in the consumption of lard to a lower level than in either of the two previous months is noticeable, though in part is probably attributable to seasonal fluctuations in demand. With the increase in the price of eggs consumption has declined.The stocks in hand are, with one exception, equal to about one week&apos;s supply. The exception is eggs where only half a week&apos;s supply is held.&apos;Pish. The quantity of fish passing through Billingsgate Market during the week ended June 15th was 1,857 tons, a decrease of 390 tons, or 17 per cent., on the previous week, and of 733 tons, or 28 per cent., on the corresponding week a year ago.Returns received from eight other inland markets for the week ended June 8th showed an increase in the total amount entering such markets of 8 per cent, over the week ended June 1st.Stocks.Stocks of meat and provisions were higher on June 8th than on the 1st of the month. The increase in bacon and hams amounted to 3,400 tons ; that in other meat was nearly as great. Stocks of fish were 2,800 tons higher, of butter 1,800 tons higher and of lard 800 tons higher. Margarine, cheese and condensed milk were practically unchanged.A  5875-3B ,
Estimates of cereal stocks for June 17th point to a decline since June 1st. Only in the case of rice is there an increase. In wheat the fall is negligible, amounting to but 5,000 tons. Barley has fallen 55,000 tons, oats and maize each nearly as much. A decrease in the stock of cereals, other than wheat, is normal at this season.From the 1st to the 17th June stocks of sugar fell 12,000 tons to 259,000 tons.Wholesale Prices.The Gazette price of barley has fallen from 59s. 2d. per quarter to 57s. 9d. per quarter. English cheddar has risen Is. 6dL per cwt. to 177s. Other changes were insignificant.
