* To&quot;avoid delay, address all communications to t- FOOD  PRODUCTION   DEPARTMENT.The Director General.72, Victoria Street,London, S.W. (1)26th June, 1918.Sir,I beg to submit the following Report on the work of the Pood Production Department for the week ended 25th June, 1918.-The Weather.. The weather was for the most part cold and dull last week with local showers, but in very few districts was there enough rain&apos;to soak the land thoroughly.   In many places clover and seeds, grass, and corn have been laid more or less badly by the heavy wind.     Crops generally continue to look well, and potatoes in particular promise a very heavy yield,LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION. Agricultural Executive Committees. Surrey - On 14th.June, 1917, the Committee took possession of 290 .acres of land at Oxted which was covered with thorns and brambles and contained only 12 acres under crops.     Ill acres are now cropped - 70 acres with oats and seeds, 11 acres with barley. 10 acres with swedes, 10 acres with rape and turnip, and 10 acres with kale.   The work of clearing the bushes is proceeding. Drainage of Land.   The work done by the Cheshire Committee by means of German prisoners in cleaning out the River Birkett   has had most satisfactory results.   It Is estimated that between 5,000 and 6,000 acres of land, all of which was previously flooded during the winter months, have been cleared of water.    Farmers who in former years were obliged to move their cattle from the low-lying land during the winter will not have to do so this year, and they
have consequently been able to plough up a considerable area of t higher land,, which is in consequence, now growing corn.   Similar (p work is being carried on at Prodsham Marshes and is being begin the River Gowey, and the Chairman of the Committee states that th works have brought great credit to the Department and the Committ: throughout the country, and should result in the restoration of some 15,000 acres of land.   The East Riding Executive Committee b commenced work on the Osgodby, Cherry Orchard and adjoining drain under Paragraph (h) of Regulation 2M.Determination of Tenancies,   During the week five Orders have bee; made authorising landlords to determine tenancies on account of farming in respect of 259 acres,HORTICULTURAL DIVISION. Provision of Land for Allotments - Reports received from 1,174 districts show that 309,053 applications have been made for plotsl under the Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917 (No.2):, and that 282,4 plots containing 20,365 acre3 have been provided.During the week eight Local Authorities have agreed to acquire 45 acres. (582 allotments) in addition to the area mentions -above.     At Oundle (Northants), where there are 580 houses, of whi 50 per cent have gardens attached, there are In addition 257 allot ment holders cultivating 33-J acres of land.     In addition Public School boys are cultivating 2j acres-, and the workhouse inmates&quot;2j acres.   Practically all the householders are assisting in food production.Y.M.C.A. Allotments.   At Derriford Convalescent Camp in the Plwno district arrangements have been made for 10 acres to be taken over in September by the. Y.M.C.A. for growing vegetables to be supplied to their various huts. .   - .    -Fruit Section,     During the week 216 demonstrations in fruit and vegetable preservation have been given in the counties, while larg exhibitions have been held at Birmingham and Swansea, and smaller ones at Maidstone, Camberley and Stockport.   13 canners and 61 grc of cans have been sold.   Orders have been received by the Ministry
2/1 * IIIof Munitions (Glassware Supply Department) up to the 15th Juno for a total of 6,674,340 jars.Marketing, of Surplus Produce.   By the end of the week 17 counties had formed registered societies and 14 counties are preparing to register.Horticultural Advisers,   In each of 953 rural and urban districts and boroughs there is now a Horticultural Representative engaged under the general direction of the County Horticultural Sub-Committee giving practical advice in allotment and other small cultivation.Small Live Stock.   The National Utility Rabbit Association havenow taken offices at 124, Victoria Street, and it is hoped that theirCentral Breeding Station will be open in about a fortnight.TECHNICAL DIVISION. Inspection of Land, A second visit has been paid to a large farm which was taken over by the Hampshire Executive Committee in March 1917.   The farm, which was then in a deplorable state, has been greatly improved, and 400 acres are under corn this season.   More than half of this is wheat which looks well.    The spring sown corn is on the whole disappointing.   Suggestions for the future management of the farm have been made.   It has been recommended in particular that roots and forage crops, to be largely fed off with sheep, should take the place of bare fallow as soon as possible.   The Inspector who visited this district reports a most marked reduction in the number of sheep kept on arable farms.     This reduction is almost entirely due to labour difficulties.Preservation of Farmyard Manure,   A memorandum indicating the chief points to which attention should be directed in the preservation of farmyard manure has been prepared for circulation to Agricultural Executive Committees,Damage to grain.by Sea Gulls, An enquiry has been made into the alleged depredations of sea gulls in corn fields of&quot;the northern counties.   The results show that although gulls are admitted to
consume grain at times, there is no case against them which would justify the Department in taking action with a view to reducing ( their numbers.LABOUR DIVISION,Release ofAgriculturaliLabour for the Army,   All other activities of the Agricultural Executive Committees are over-shadowed at the present time by their efforts to obtain their quota of the 30,000 Grade I men who the War Cabinet decided were to be released from agriculture for military service.   No duty could have been placed upon the Committees which was less in keeping with the objects for which they were established, but recognising that the decision of War Cabinet had to be obeyed they have done their utmost to secure the number of men required, whatever the results may be on the production of food. &apos;Of the 30;000 men required, 15,877 have been found up tc date under the Proclamation of April 20th relating to the men of ages 18-23, and the remainder, namely 14,123, have to be supplied from Grade I men of the ages 24-31.While the Committees have most loyally and efficiently carried out their task they have felt It incumbent upon them to inform the Department of the serious effects upon food production which must follow from the withdrawal from the land of such a lard proportion of its already limited supply of skilled labour.   The task of finding men to the number required has been rendered especially difficult owing to two causes:-    (a)   the percentage of men who have been placed in Grade T is much lower than was anticipated, and (b) in many counties the Agricultural Executive Committees have been consistently for months past sending their l%\ year old boys to the Colours as they have reached that age, notwithstanding their power to protect such boys..The position in which agriculture has been placed can best be. realised by considering the cases of a few typical counts .  The quota for Northampton is 500, and up to date 422
9 A 9men have been either posted to the Colours or scheduled for release. Of this number, 311 are skilled men, farmers, foremen, shepherds, stockmen, thatchers, tractor drivers, etc.,, arid include 9 engine drivers, 44 shepherds and 186 waggoners.   The Committee recognise that the large majority of these men are irreplaceable, but it has been impossible for them to obtain anything like their whole quota except by releasing such men,In Gloucester the Committee has had to find 477 men aged 24-31.   The Ministry of National Service considered that there were about 1,000 men of these ages In the county, but on medical examination only 534 proved to be Grade I.   The Committee have so far arranged for the release of only 250 of these men,   Never-theless they have had to sacrifice tenant farmers up to   50 acres, and similar men whose loss will be irreparable.   The representative of the Ministry of National Service who has attended each meeting has expressed the opinion that the Committee could not have been more painstaking or drastic in dealing with the cases under review,^n West Sussex the Committee has been similarly pressed to find its quota.    One man farming 323 acres and working- 5 horses in two teams has had his only carter called up.   The taking of this man destroys the possibility of the present corn crops being cut at all except by supplied labour.   In the case of one farm of 1,919 acres, where 27 or more horses are being worked, only two carters are left, but the Committee has been obliged to sanction the calling up of one of these two.   The men released so far In the county include 8 shepherds, 126 ploughmen, 4 foremen, 12 engine drivers, 11 stockmen, 6 farmers, 9 managers and 6 black-smiths and wheelwrights.The result has been that in this county four farms have already been put up for sale in consequence of the shortage of labour..
Ql tilIThere can be no doubt whatever that throughout the i of England, speaking generally the farms have beon so drained o! labour, that food production is in a position of great danger, Harvest Labour. The scheme for the provision of migratory gangs of prisoners of war to assist with the harvest has been accepts by the Southern and Eastern Commands, and is being put into operation immediately. It is expected that the Northern and Western Commands, which are being approached on the matter this week, will also raise no objection to this scheme being adopted their areas.The War Office have now agreed that convalscent soldi may be made available to assist with harvest work on condition they return to the convalscent camp each night or twice a week medical Inspection.The Air Board have been- asked for assistance with lab: for the harvest, but state that it is not possible to spare any of the Royal Air Force for whole-time work in this connection. General Officers Commanding have, however, been informed that eij encouragement is to be given to men of the Royal Air Force to volunteer to assist local farmers whenever their services can tof spared from their military duties.SoldierLabour.   The total number of soldiers now out on farms59,564,, including an additional 826 men sent out during the weePrisoners of War.   13 additional agricultural camps have beenopened during the week, making the total number of prisoners no?employed on farm or drainage work as followsFrom 223 agricultural camps ...........12,783Employed from other camps.............1,008Combatant prisoners lodged on farms ..._30414,095Released aliens employed In agriculture 2,08316,178
lis&amp; schemes for additional camps are now with the War Office, providing for the employment of a further 7,316 prisoners in agriculture.   134 schemes for the employment of 5,027 prisoners are at present being held over until further prisoners are available for farm work.Women1 s^ Branch,Recruiting. In the four weeks ending June 7th 3,252 women were added to the Land Army.   This is an advance of 324 on the figures of the previous four weeks.   Since the recruiting campaign started at the end of March, 28,393 recruits have actually enrolled in the Land Army, and just over 25$ of these have been finally selected.   The higher percentage of applicants selected in London would seem to justify the manner of recruiting adopted by the headquarters recruit-Ing, staff, and it is proposed, therefore, that this method should be extended&apos;to every industrial area in the country.Street corner meetings have been held in London as usual whenever the weather has permitted,   During one dinner hour 4 meetings wore held in Canning Town after -which 40 women signed on in half an hour,   The Floral Fete in Trafalgar Square has afforded excellent opportunities for recruiting, and there has been c more or less perpetual open air meeting going on round the Land Army table in the Square all day.A tour in Gloucester has up to the present resulted in 40 recruits at Cirencester, 20 at Gloucester and 100 at Cheltenham. Rallies have been held this week in Anglesey, Winchester, Chelmsford, Thaxted and Preston.Recruiting in Ireland.     Arrangements have been made whereby Irish women are interviewed, by a Ministry of Labour Selection Committee in Ireland and sent to England for agricultural work. These women join the Land Army in the usual way and are treated in all respects as ordinary recruits.      Those enrolling at the
present time are being sent direct to Ousefleet to work In connection with the flax harvest.Training ana Employment,   The demand for field workers continues but a growing supply is now available from the gang hostels. The demand.for skilled mifclfcers is increasing.     Reports from the various counties show that the need of village forewomen is great.     There is also a demand for women sufficiently skilled to act as forewomen in gang hostels, but experienced Yeomen&apos; usually prefer to replace stockmen rather than to act as forewojjDuring the past week hostels have been opened in several counties to meet the increased demands,, two in Yorkshire] to accommodate 32 women, one in Essex for 8, one in Northampton for 12 and one in Hertford for 7.Arrangements for woman labour in connection with flax pulling are now complete.     Two thousand are being sent by the Women1 s National Land Service Corps to Somerset and Northamptonshire, and a gang of two hundred school girls from the Secondary schools in Yorkshire will work in that county and be housed in the gang hostel at Ousefleet..The number of women accounted - for in the Land Armyis 12,462, as follows i-On farm work.............  .....8,934Lent to Forage Department&apos; ......   182 &quot;Lent to Timber Supply Dept......   189In Instruction Centres .........2,441Waiting for references to beplaced in Training Centres...,   429 , ... - .Waiting in Depots ,..............   147Waiting in their own homes......   14012(L462-W ome n&apos;s Institutes,.

Henry Ford and Son, had been despatched to farmers.Horse Scheme.    The following figures show the position with regard to the provision of horse-drawn implements for the weektending 22nd June:-Consigned to      Total no. counties consduring week.      to date.Carts and lorries ........ 549 2,555Cultivators .............. - 1,396Disc harrows............. 3 756Drills .................. - 1,467   .Harrows and drags........ - 3,158Ploughs.................. 5 5,248Rollers and pressers ..... - 2,603A considerable number of horses which the Departmenthad on loan from the Remount Department are now fit and have beenwithdrawn for service overseas.     These animals are only withdrawn
when they can he replaced by purchased horses, so that there -is 0 no interference with the work of the Committees. The reports frc the counties show that the horses are rapidly recovering condition by being out at grass, and as many as possible in each county are being rested and built up with a view to getting them into good oondition for autumn work. ........Steam, Tackle.   39,070 acres were dealt with during the past week, Preparation for the 1918 Harvest.   108 binders were consigned during the week ending 22nd June, making a total of 3,350 consigns to date.    All demands of Agricultural Executive Committees for binders can&apos; be met by the stock of binders now in the hands ofthe Department. --* -......    .In connection with the negotiations with the Forage Committee for the release of traotion engines, arrangements have been made for the loan to the Committee of 16; to 20 tractors for experimental work in hay baling.      If the experiments prove successful, the negotiations with the Committee should be greatly facilitated.The supply of labour for threshing and steam oultivatioi is causing great concern. Considerable numbers of steam plough! and steam threshing engine drivers are being called up for militai serviceSWPliIES ^rTOipff. Bi5^r ^^ fL1    During the harvest season dealers are accustomed to apply to makers for small quantities of binder twine which are urgently required to supply the immediate needs of farmers in their district, and arrangements have been made for these orders to be met&quot;this season&quot;out of the quantities which have been manufactured by certain makers to the order of this Department. Lime.    There appears to be an increased demand for delivery duri the coming autumn and farmers are being advised to place their
orders at once and to take delivery without dele? In order to avpid a reduction in output by the works during the summer,   A fre3h survey of sources of supplies is being made by the Depart-ment&apos;s Inspectors with a view to directing prisoner and other labour to works in need of such aid.Stable Manure. An Interesting example of local effort was brought to the notice of the Department in the case of the distribution of stable manure from a remount depot in Lancashire. In this case a local,committee of farmers.has been formed which rations the supply to farmers at the rate of 15 tons per acre of green crops, and 20 tons per acre in the case of allotment holders This system has been found to work very successfully, and an endeavour is. being made to extend it to other parts of Lancashire. I ire Netting and Fencing feire.-Owing to the demands of the army, the production of wire of all kinds for agricultural purposes has ^practically ceased, though there is some hope that the makers will shortly be allowed to employ some part of their plant on other than War Office orders.Wart Disease of Potatoes. The planting of the Departmentfs trial grounds at Ormskirk for testing different varieties of potatoes as to their immunity, or otherwise from wart disease has been completed.   Approximately 6 acres, containing over 300 separate lots of potatoes, have been planted.   The list of varieties approved as immune under the Wart Disease Order of 1918 will be compiled from these tests and the results of tests in previous years.   The number of varieties of first early potatoes which are immune from wart disease is at present very small, and it is  . hoped that the prosent list may be augmented as a result of these twlals.Potato Spraying. More than 40 specimens of potati plants affected with various ailments have been examined and reported upon during the past week.     Some of these were supposed to be attacked by &quot;blight&quot; but this was not confirmed in any case.   No
reliable records of the appearance of ,Tblight&quot; this year have us10yet been received from any district except South West Cornwall&apos;.A well organised scheme for the utilisation of horse, drawn spraying machines is being adopted in the county of Somerset Applications have been received from farmers and others already fo the spraying of 100 acres. There has been a very considerable demand for spraying demonstrations from all parts of Devon and the Department^ organisers have had to employ extra help in order to meet the demands for assistance.have been inspected during the last week, and it is evident that t demand, for knapsack machines this season has increased considerabl During the last 7 or 8 days one firm alone has dispatched nearly 500 machines.The works of two large manufacturers of spraying machineI am,Sir;Your obedient Servant,Director-General.The Rt. Hon. Rowland E. Prothero, M.P.President of the Board of Agricultureand Fisheries.
