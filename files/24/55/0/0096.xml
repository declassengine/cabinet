WAR CABINET.

THE WHOLESALE MILK TRADE.

(Memorandum by the Minister of Reconstruction).

The Memoranda which have been circulated in regard to the Control of Milk Distribution (G.T.4865, 4904 and 4949) appear to raise two principal issues - (a) the question whether the Wholesale Milk Trade should be controlled, and (b) the question of State Purchase.

I desire to make certain observations in regard to (b), as the issues involved relate closely to the investigations which are already being carried out by my Department.

In G.T.4904 Major Astor suggests that the Ministry of Reconstruction should be asked "to examine the policy which the state should adopt to the Trade Trusts or semi-trusts which will have been created during the war, frequently as the result of Government action". In this connection I would point out that I have already appointed a Committee with these Terms of Reference:- "In view of the probable extension and development of Trade Organisations and Combinations, to consider and report what action, if any, may be necessary to safeguard the Public interest". The Committee have already proceeded a considerable way in their investigation; but I will draw their attention to the special questions which may arise at the end of the war owing to the control exercised over these combinations during the war. In view of the operation of this Committee I doubt the necessity of the proposal in the last paragraph of Mr. Clynes&apos; Minute G.T.4949, to refer to a Committee the financial questions directly and indirectly arising out of control.
At least I should be glad if the Ministry of Reconstruction could have an opportunity of further discussing the proposal if the Ministry of Food are anxious to press the suggestion that a further Committee should be set up for this purpose. The issues involved affect all the Departments which have been responsible for controlling any of the various industries, and particularly affect the Ministry of Reconstruction in their responsibility for dealing with problems bearing on Post-war developments. It appears to me that the Trusts Committee, which i have already set up, is adequate to effect the purpose which Mr. Clynes has in mind.

In the meantime I would suggest that the immediate problem raised in regard to the Control of Milk might be met by the appointment of a Committee of experts to enquire into the financial problem involved in the suggested Purchase of the Milk Trade, particularly in regard to the two following questions:-

(a) Whether it is desirable that the proposed option should be obtained, and if so, on what terms;

(b) In the event of such option being considered desirable, what would be the best method and approximate cost of Purchase by the State.
