Week ended 15th June, 1918.NAVAL OPERATIONS.Mines have been laid in the Heligoland Bight, in the North Sea, and in the northern North Sea. approaches to the Dover Straits.A number of reconnaissances and patrols have been carried out in various areas by R.A.F. machines employed on naval duty.   Several mines have been sighted and sunk.Machines from Dunkirk have, in addition, made the following raids :  FlandersDate.June. 8th-9th  .. 10th 11thllth-12th.. 12th12th-13th 13th-Hth.14th 15thObjective.Approximate weight of bombs dropped.area.Thourout     ............Zeebrugge    ............Bruges Docks and Zeebrugge      ...Bruges Docks and vicinity......Ostend Docks        .........Zeebrugge    ............Bruges................Ostend and Zeebrugge      ......Ostend Dock, Zeebrugge, Bruges,Ghistelles aerodrome and Thouroutrailway junction Thourout and Ghistelles aerodromeBruges Docks............Zeebrugge    ............Ostend Docks............Batteries at Sylte and St. PierreCapelleTotal weight......Tons.1-361HiiResults observed or remarks.Two hits on Mole.A fire caused on Eastern Darse, and hits onBrugeoise Works.

Hits on Northern Darse at Bruges Dock, and on railway stations at Ostend and Thourout.Hits on Mole and near Lock Gates.32 TonsIn carrying out these raids one enemy machine was destroyed, and one of our machinesis missing.On 9th June the monitors &quot; Terror&quot; and &quot; Marshal Soult&quot; bombarded the salvage craft around the blockships at Zeebrugge at a range of 27,000 yards; 50 rounds were fired, of which 26 were spotted. Aircraft report that the shooting was good, one shell falling between the two blockships-in which position a dredger and a hopper had been seen to be working a short time previously and others very close. Twelve minutes after the commencement of the bombardment the enemy opened fire with a 12-inch gun from Kaiser Wilhelm II battery, but although our monitors were straddled neither was hit. The enemy also put a barrage from smaller calibre guns between the monitors and the shore.On 9th June enemy aircraft raided Brindisi, but did not succeed in inflicting any Mediter-material damage.   Three enemy machines were brought down, two prisoners being taken, raiean.On the same day Allied machines attacked Cattaro and Durazzo, about 2 tons of bombs being dropped with good effect.   A merchant ship was set on fire, and a large(C1244)  Wt.     -     55   6/18  H&amp;S A
bomb was seen to explode in the dockyard at Cattaro. All the Allied machines returned safely.On 13th Jane six Allied machines again attacked Cattaro, 20 bombs being dropped on submarine and seaplane bases. Our machines were attacked by four enemy aircraft, and anti-aircraft fire was also opened, but all the machines returned to their base, two, however, being damaged.During the past week aircraft attached to the British iEgean Squadron have bombed aerodromes and enemy works at Drama, Strunia and other places on the Bulgarian and Turkish coasts.A constant patrol of the Dardanelles has been maintained, and during engagements with enemy machines two fighter scouts were brought down in flames.Casualties.        On 5th June the armed boarding steamer &quot; Snaefell&quot; was torpedoed and sunk in the Mediterranean, seven of the crew being lost.On 13th June the armed merchant cruiser &quot; Patia&quot; was torpedoed and sunk in a position 33 miles from Trevose Head, one officer and 15 men being lost.On 13th June the light cruiser &quot; Centaur&quot; struck a mine in a position 50 miles from Terschelling Bank Light Vessel, but reached the Humber safely, where she is being repaired.On 13th June the light cruiser &quot; Conquest&quot; struck a mine off the Sunk, but reached Chatham safely, where repairs are being effected.On 14th June the trawler &quot; Princess Olga &quot; was sunk by mine eight miles west of Havre.   The1 crew was saved.ATTACK UPON ENEMY SUBMARINES.Submarines The number of large enemy submarines operating has continued at a low figure operating, during the week under review, only six of these vessels having been located, one being of the &quot; Deutschland&quot; cruiser type and still working off the American coast. The remaining large boats have been operating to the south of Ireland or have been on passage. Great activity on the part of smaller submarines has been experienced off the north-east coast of England from the Fame Islands to the&quot; Humber and during the early part of the week, also off the south-western coast of England between Portland and Land&apos;s End.Actions The following Table shows the number of actions between Allied craft and enemywith enemy submarines which are reported to have taken place in all waters during recent weeks, and submarines, the nature of the craft which have been engaged, and also thg number of submarines which have been destroyed as the result of such actions or which have been interned : 	Week ended		Week ended		Week ended		Week ended		May 25th.

Submarines possibly sunk are not included.The comparatively small number of actions reported in the last two weeks is doubtless accounted for by the reduction in the number of submarines which have been operating.

The percentage of losses to sailings in United Kingdom Overseas trades during the week is -94 as against -56 in the previous week, in Cross-Channel trades is -89 as against -49, and in Coasting trades is -63 as against -08, while as regards all United Kingdom trades the percentage is -83 as against -39 in the previous week. On the other hand the losses in other trades are this week much less than in the previous week.The Table in Appendix III is a comparative statement of all merchant vessels, Foreign Areas as well as British, damaged and unsuccessfully attacked in the last two weeks by enemy in which craft and by mine, classified according to areas. vessels lostFrom this Table it will be seen that activity has again increased in the North Sea and has been more marked in the English Channel. In the Irish Sea and Bristol Channel there were fewer attacks than for many weeks past.The number pi British and Foreign merchant vessels sailing in organised convoy Vessels which have completed their voyages during last week, and the losses sustained whilst convoyed-in such convoys, compared with corresponding figures for previous periods, are as follows : 	Weekly average, April, 1918.

ENEMY MINES.There has been very little minelaying activity on the part of the enemy dining the Minelaying, week under review, only 18 moored mines having been destroyed.  This is the lowest number recorded in any week since November last.   The only places in which mines are believed to have been laid during the week are at the junction of the Harwich and Nore areas, and in the vicinity of Beachy Head. -The area comprised within a 5-mile radius from the position in which &quot; Koningen Regentes&quot; was sunk has been searched for mines but none have been found. On the other hand, new German moored mines have been located in the direct line of passage agreed upon for repatriation vessels, and nine such mines were swept up between the 2nd and. 7th of June.The following table shows the number of enemy mines destroyed and British vessels Casualties, sunk by mine in Home Waters (including the Havre and Cherbourg areas) in recent Weeks : Week Ended.

No enemy ships have entered or left mea&apos; Rotterdam. ;. &apos; vFOREIGN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE. Russia.At present a few hostile patrols are reported to be in the neighbourhood of Pechenga. where about 400 British marines and bluejackets are entrenched, supported by the British cruiser &quot; Cochrane.&quot; A concentration of 2,000 Finnish White Guards under German officers is reported to be about 100 miles south of Pechenga, and a further concentration, supplied with material for a light railway, is reported at Rovaniemi in north-western Finland. Reinforcements are being sent to our men at Pechenga, but it is not considered probable that any attack in force will be made on them in the near future.Small reinforcements ha,ve already arrived at Murmansk and others have been sent on to Kandalaksha on the White Sea. Allied forces in this area are believed to number about 1,000 men. with some field guns and machine guns and an armoured train. A reconnaissance in force is being undertaken towards Kem in order to inspire the local inhabitants and to investigate reports of enemy patrols in this neighbourhood, but the French cruiser &quot; Amiral Aube&quot; which was despatched from Murmansk to assist in the operations towards Kem, has been obliged to return to Murmansk on account of ice obstruction in the entrance to the White Sea.Admiral ZarubaiefE has been appointed S.N.O. Baltic Fleet at Kronstadt.The Finnish Navy is to be controlled by a commission consisting of one German and one Finnish officer. No details as to the composition of &quot;this navy have at present been received.(C 1244) A 3
The Commissar of the Navy has ordered the Black Sea Fleet to return from Novoros-sisk to Sevastopol, relying on a mere declaration by the German Government that it is the property of the Russian Republic and will be returned to them after the war. Several officers of the staff of the Black Sea Fleet are at Kiev endeavouring to arrange a transfer of the fleet to the Ukraine, in which case it is to be destroyed.&quot; The Ukraine Government, however, are demanding that it shall be used against the Allies.At Sevastopol the dockyard workmen have refused to repair the &quot; Goeben.&quot;The Germans have definitely refused to recognise the plain Red Flag as either the War or Commercial Flag of Russia.Adriatic.On June 10th, just before dawn, an Austrian squadron consisting of two Dreadnoughts, escorted by T.B.D.&apos;s, was attacked by two Italian motor launches while of? Premuda Island (50 miles south-east of Pola). One battleship, the &quot; Szent Istvan,&quot; was sunk by torpedo, and the other is reported to have been hit. A Destroyer is also stated to have been damaged by depth charges.  The motor launches returned safely to Venice.Spain.Very little progress has been made with the ambitious naval construction programme sanctioned by the shipbuilding law of February, 1915. The Spanish Navy is largely dependent on other countries for its naval guns, armour and engines, and as the supply from these sources is practically cut off, there appears to be little probability of the various vessels now on the slips being completed. The Dreadnought battleship, &quot; Jaime I,&quot; laid down in 1912, has still no guns, though it is otherwise complete.China-.As there appears to be no prospect of a settlement of the trouble between the North and South and none of the Yangtze provinces can be said to be under the control of a responsible authority, it has been necessary to strengthen the British flotilla on the river. The result has been a cessation of overt acts of brigandage or piracy against British and Allied ships.There appears to be a revival of anti-foreign feeling and action, and a British ship has been sent to patrol of! the coasts of Chekiang, the maritime province immediately south of Shanghai. The Chinese Navy Department has expressed its intention of sending Chinese ships also, but has refused to co-operate with the British, and has protested against the despatch of the British ship.Naval. Staff,20ih June, 1918.[Appendices.
