DETAILS REGARDING ROYAL CAEIADIAF IUVT(Memorandum from the&apos; Department of the Naval Service, Government of Canada, for circulation at .the Imperial War Cabine-t, 1918)&apos; GENERAL&apos;DESCRIPTION.In addition to the general administration of the dockyards at&apos;Halifax and Bsquimalt, the Maval College, at Halifax, the Niabe, Rainbow,&apos; Shearwater and submarines, Fisheries Protection Service,,-Life., Saving Service, fisheries, Tidal and Currents Survey,&apos; Radiotelegraph and Hydro graphic Survey, the department is actively employed on suoh -matters-as naval intelligence, contraband, enemy and neutral&apos;commerce, censorship movements, etc.-,&apos; of store and troop transports, as v/ell as being responsible for and organizing minesweeplng flotillas, coastal patrols, harbour defence, etc., etc..On the declaration of war tho Niobe and Rainbow and the officers and men serving in them were placed at the disposal of the Admiralty.-    At: that time the Rainbow we in full commission, having been in all respects prepared for sea shortly before, in order to carry out patrol duty on the Behring Sea.     Tho British Government asked us to undertake that work in connection with the treaty in regard to pelagic sealing.&apos;    She was therefore available for immediate service, and was at once&apos;despatched from Esquimalt to guard tho&quot;trade routes and protect the sloops Algerine and Shearwater which were proceeding north.     These two vessels arrived safely at Esquimalt. and since that time the Rainbow has been continuously employed in tho protection of trade and other duties in tho Horth Pacific and on the coast of British Columbia, being attached to a squadron under the orders of the Imperial senior officer at that station.
As soon as she was reedy, the Niobe joined the squadron updor the command of the&apos;Rear-Jtairal^xwnroanding the North American Station, in which she did duty until Seprterriber&quot;19]l when, owing $0 the very considerable amount of almost continuous steaming she had done since the outbreak; of the war it was considered that the general state of her machinery and boilers dl not warrant her oontinuanco in this duty, without a thorough and : expensive refit.     This being the case, in conjunction with1the urgent necessity of a depot ship to be used to accommodate the numerous drafts of men passing through Halifax, and of a parent ship for the vassols employed on patrol work, etc on the Atlanti Coast; it was decided to pay her off and re-commission her for tl purposes indicated, approval having first been obtained from the Admiralty,     Since that date sho has proved very suitable for hei &apos;new functions, and has been.of utility in connection with Canadi and Imperial service.Two submarines building in Soattle for the Chilian Government were purchased by the Dominion Government and.brought to Esquimalt the day war wes declared.      The crews were rocztuite from officers and men in the Dominion, the Government being fortunate in this respect in obtaining the services of two retire officers of the Royal Navy who had both had several years&apos; experience in submarines,.     These vessels were also placed at tho disposal of the Admiralty.Permission was also obtained from the Admiralty to use the &quot;Shearwater&quot; as a mother ship for the submarines.     In 1917 the &quot;Shearwater&quot; convoyed the submarines from Esquimalt to Halifa at tho Admiralty&apos;s request, but as they did not prove very well suited for long voyages, they are still in use on the East Coast.
Naval depots were ostablishod at Halifax and Esquimaltfor the accommodation of supernumerary ratings, etc.      At Halifax buildings in the dockyard were adapted and utilized untilit became necessary, owing to tho increase in number and size of drafts, and other conditions-, to utilize tho Niobo for thispurpose, as already explained.At Esquimalt the depot was used for the training ofE.N.C.v\B, officers and men.&quot;i:&apos;::v&apos;&apos;.:&apos;       - &quot;.&apos;;\:&apos;.     iA largo number of tther. vessels, both Bovernmontal and private, are being used in conneotion with the naval defence of the coast.    Thej? are being employed on the various services hereinafter specified.The ice-breaker Earl Grey, on her sale to the Russian Government, was transferred to this department to be sent to Archangel; a carerw of naval ratings was provided, and the vessel was successfully navigated to her destination, the voyage of 3,000 miles being completed in 14 days.    On arrival at Archangel she was turned over to tho Russian authorities.     The crew returned by ordinary steamer, some rejoining the British Navy, and some returning to Canada for further services in the Canadian Navy.ersonnel: On the outbreak of war, recruiting was activelycarried on to complete the Mobe&apos;s crew, &apos;s previously stated,-and to obtain the requisite crews for other vessels employed on subsidiary duties, preference being given to men with previous naval experience.     The total number of officers and men in the K.C.R. and R.N.C.V.K. is now 5,123.Th,e department has acted as recruiting agent for the Admiralty, and a largo number of Imperial service officers and men have boon reached, sand arrangements made for their transportation from all parts of the&apos; Dominion to England.    The department has aJ,so handled the transportation arrangements for
numerous drafts of nav/?l ratings proceeding to and from Bngland, In April 1915 tho Admiralty rccuestod tho department \ soleot a considerable number of- men to bo trained as pilots forj the Royal Baval Air Service.Mine sweeping. At certain ports a mine swooping flotilla is provided,)Tais consistFof comparatively small vessels whoso duty it is to keep the approaches to the harbour clear of enemy1 s mines. This entails daily operations on their part.Patrol * A number of vessels are employed on patrol duty ondifferent parts of the coast.     3?hcy are charged with the dutykeeping watch for hostile craft of all sorts, and tracing rumou]of their presence.     Ehfi patrol is organized jointly with thoImperial authorities and the Government of Newfoundland.WirolQSS It vas found necessary at the beginning of the war v\telegraphyand    close a large number of stations.    On tho west ooast^ the censorsMp.situation having now relaxed, they have all been re-opened.   Ijj conformity with the procedure In other parts of the Empire, a censorship is imposed on all wireless telegraph messages emam therefrom.All enemy merchant ships were ordered to he detained on the outbreak of war, the arrangement for this being conclud1 with the Customs Department,(The only German ship in Canadian harbours was the barque Bellas which was seized at Kimouskl and has since been condemned in the Prize Cou-rt.Tho Austrian steamer Ida was seized also, but subsequently released under the &quot;-days of grace&quot; allowed.Many important questions regarding contraband and neutral commerce are continually arising which indirectly e.it\ tho department and are denlt with accordingly.Enemy and neutral Commerce
I&apos;1 The department is continually in conference with thoCustoms Department   with s view to pro venting coal or supplies reaching tho onemy or enemy agents by moans of neutral or othor vessels,.   Stringent steps have been taken to this end.st   &apos; it certain Pi-ices guns have been mounted sad manned byIgnc c6.naval officers and men, whilst in other places protection has beenprepared by tho provision of motor torpedo boats and mines preparedfor laying in case of emergency.     As tho situation relaxed, these&quot;wore gradually withdrawn.al A system for the collection and distribution of navalLligence.intelligence has been organised, acting in concert with tho Imperial authorities, bour All details connected v;ith naval defence at defended portsare undertaken by this department.Arrangements have been maintained on both tho east and vwt coasts for tho supply of fresh provisions at short notice to all ships requiring such, both Canadian, Imperial and Allied %In addition, material assistance is being rendered to the-Imperial service in tho supply of stores of every description to Hie. Male sty &apos;s ships from the several dockyards and also by direct purchase.    Considerable quantities have also been Supplied to and&apos; purchased for Bermuda and Hong long dockyards.,   The&apos;Imperial,authorities continue to utilize our facilities at both dockyards to keor. in reserve large supplies of special stores and clothing for tho use of ships doing duty in tho. North Atlantic and in the Pacific.    These are accounted for and looked after in the same manner and with the same care as are 1 Canadian stores.    Ordnance stores *nfy ammunition particularly roouirc great caro and it has boon found necessary to organize Special dopots for the purpose.
Arrangements have also been made for the coaling and oiling of H.M. Ships at Canadian Ports as necessary.

Licenses:

All wireless stations, other than Government Stations are licensed by the Department.

Compulsory equipment of vessels:

Since the 1st January 1914, certain passenger carrying vessels are under the Radiotelegraph Act ? to carry radiotelegraph equipment and a competent operator. The Radiotelegraph Branch is charged with the administration of this law which applies not only to Canadian vessels but to every vessel visiting a Canadian port, irrespective of nationality.

In addition to the above a war time measure. Regulation 23 A of the "Defence of Canada Order 1917" has been placed in effect, the same prescribes that on and after the first day of January 1918, every British Steamer registered in Canada, of sixteen hundred tons gross tonnage or upwards, sailing to or from any port in Europe or in the Mediterranean Sea, shall be provided with an efficient radiotelegraph apparatus in good working order, with two certificated operate in charge.

A proper inspection service is maintained by the Department and vessels are regularly inspected to see that the


law is being complied with.

Operators&apos; Certificates:

All wireless operators must be the holders of a Certificate of Proficiency in Radiotelegraphy. Examinations are held by the Department from time to time, throughout the country.

Equipment:

The equipment and operation of the radiotelegraph sets in all the warships, patrol and auxiliary vessels of the Canadian Naval Service is undertaken directly by the Radiotelegraph Branch, while the operation of the sets in vessels belonging to other Departments is either undertaken directly by it or under its immediate supervision. Censorship:

The censorship of radiotelegraph messages is undertaken by the Department.

Equipment in Transports:

The inspection, repair, and in many cases the equipment, of the Wireless sets in H.M. transport plying between Canada and Europe is handled by the Department, special officers being appointed for this work at the different ports to which these vessels ply.

At the outbreak of war numerous equipments were installed, but latterly the number of new equipments has been reduced, practically all the transports being now equipped with radiotelegraph sets.

The Department on receipt of instruction from the Admiralty is in a position to supply and instal ships&apos; dynamos radiotelegraph equipments, and competent operators at a moment&apos;s notice.

The equipment in every transport as before stated is inspected immediately on her arrival, and if the set is found
dofootivo or her operator incompetent, stops are taken to remedy tho samo, so that overy transport leaving this country is reasonably assured of a first olass radiotelegraph service, Training of Operators;A training school is maintained by tho Department in Ottawa for the training of wireless operators.
