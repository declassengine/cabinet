(1)19th June, 1918.Sir, f -I beg to submit the following Report on the work of the Food Production Department for the week ended 18th Juno, 1918:-The Weather.Variable weather has been experienced throughout the country during the past week.   In some parts of Wales and the extreme West the rainfall laid standing grass and damaged the haulm of the potatoes.    In other parts of the country the rain has not been sufficient materially to assist the growth of crops, and has unfortunately hampered hay making in a large number of districts.LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION.      ; Agricultural Executive Committees. Corny;all - The Committee have been authorised to take possession .. of 97 acres of land forming part of Wadfast Moor.   This land, which is heavy and has for many years been out of cultivation, i% now let for grazing at a nominal rent.   The Committee propose to . cultivate the land themselves and the landlord offers no objection to this proposal.Staffordshire - The Committee have been authorised to take possession of 120 acres of enclosed land known as Highgate Common, Snville.     The land is covered with tough dry soil and appears never to have been cultivated.   The Committee propose breaking , it up with a steam plough in order to grow potatoes next year.
The Lands Committee of the County Borough of Stoke-on Trent, acting under the Cultivation of Lands (County Boroughs) Qrdj 1917, have caused 495 out of the total of 2,943 acre3 of pasture land in the County Borough to be converted into arable.   They have themselves carried out the cultivation; of 40 acres.   A great part of the pasture land is entirely unsuitable for cultivation. Worcestershire - A farm of 170 acres at Churchill has been under observation by the Committee for the past 12 months, but no sensible improvement has been made.   There are 50 acres planted t potatoes and 40 acres, of fallow on the farm, and both are extremel foul.   The Committee have now taken possession of the whole area and intend to clean the foul fallow themselves, and to offer the remainder for cultivation to the Women&apos;s 3far Agricultural Commit^ Prosecutions - - A farmer near Cotton-under-Edge has been fined  75 for non-compliance with an order to plough up 24 acres of grass land, and a farmer near Horncastle in Lindsey has been fined a similar sum for failure to plough up 13 aores of land. Drainage of Land - The East Riding Executive Committee have for a considerable time had under supervision the drainage of the area drained by the River Foulness, the outfall of which is the Market Weighton Canal.   The river and canal are vested in the Drainage and Navigation Trustees and in November last an Order was made fo the opening of the outfall doors at the mouth of the canal so tin the canal should serve the purpose of an arterial drain, the traffic on it being limited to that of one firm only.   This.meas has answered its purpose, but the upper channels require cleans! and the trustees have not carried out the necessary improvements! The Executive Committee propose to exercise the powers of the   m trustees in this behalf under,Para, (j) of Regulation 2M and,,a % of money has been placed to the credit of the Committee by the Department for this purpose.
The Flintshire Committee are carrying Qut, by te^ajigemeirt- with the Denbigh. Committee, the cleansing of the drains -throughout Rhuddlan Marsh, which lies partly in Flintshire and, partly in Denbighshire.     The work in the latter county has alreadybeen completed.    In this portion.....300.acres have been brought intoa suitable condition for cropping for 1918 and a further 100 acres will be ploughed for 1919,    GOO acres have been improved as pasture   thus   making a total&apos;of 1,200 acres affected by these operations..    The work has cost  1,900 or just over 30/- per acre,and it is hoped that this sum will be recovered.....from those interestedWork is now proceeding on theFlintshire portion of the Marsh. Determination of Tenancies.   During the week one Order has been made authorising the landlord to determine a tenancy on account of bad farming in respect of 10 acres, and two Orders have been made by the Board determining the tenancies of 128 acres *&quot; &apos; &apos; &apos; HORTICULTURAL DIVISIONProvision,ef Land for Allotments.    Reports received, from 1,173 districts show that 306,945 applications have been made for plots under the Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917 (No.2). and that 280,382 plots containing 20,179 acres have been provided.During the week five local authorities have undertaken to acquire, in addition to the area mentioned above, 34 acres (465 allotments) including 15 acres at wood Green.    The land at Wood Green adjoins the Alexandra Park Race Track and is the property of the Alexandra Park Racecourse Syndicate, who have agreed to surrender the 15 acres for hand cultivation.    The Women !s Land Army will undertake this work after the present hay or*ip has been harvested.A further area of 19 acres of land adjacent to Y.M.04A huts has been acquired, for cultivation purposes during the week.
Fruit Section, Two new basket making centres have been started ../ in &apos;connection with the scheme sanctioned by the Ministry of PensioJ i r Four centres for the . training of women have been opened in connect; with the same scheme. . Six diss.bled soldiers are now engaged in basket&apos;making at Kvesham;. A sufficient supply of osiers has been -secured to enable the. work-shops to be kept, fully occupied for twelve &quot;months.        .1   &apos; 188 demonstrations &quot;in fruit and vegetable preservinghave been given during the weak.Marketing.   Registered marketing societies have now been formedin eight counties, and local markets in five counties. A rholesaj .  market will be held at Cambridge on the 21st.June.     a satisfactorbasis for working has been arranged in Wiltshire between the .*   proposed Couriiy Society and the Wiltshire Plain Association.    TheSurrey, Hants, and Berks. Growers1 Committee will become themarketing society for Surrey.. It has been arranged with the...Road Transport Board thattheir Divisional Transport Officers shall.either sit on the MarketExecutive Committees, or nominate, suitable representatives for thipurpose.    Arrangements for&apos; transport are&apos; practically completein the western counties.-:  County - societies ..are advised to provide, the Departmentwith a de;tailea statement of mileage and vehicles available in or^that an, application for the&apos;required amount of petrol may be madeto. the^Boad.. Transport Board,/ &quot;it&amp;Ss;&apos;1 &apos;.- TSOKHICAL DIVISION. &apos; &apos;Soil Pests,.; on flewly Ploughed Pas tures.   The results of art enquiry -. into the&apos;damage done by leather-jackets and wireworms to crops. -on newly broken grass land show that, generally speaking, succe^ ... -crops have been obtained from land broken early in the season, atf , . . fAfen&apos;; from ilafld ploughed latej   while oats sown on land broken upduring the dead of winter have, in many cases, proved a failure.
Storage of Grain, An enquiry has &quot;been addressed to Agricultural organisers^ etc., asking for information on methods successfully adopted for the storage of grain in their various districts.   The question of possible loss from defective stack building and thatching is also receiving attention.Frit Fly Experiments.   Preliminary reports have been received from two of the centres at which experiments in the control of frit fly in oats aretfeing conducted *   The results show the advantages of early sowing.   At one centre the incidence of the disease among oats sown the third week in April was five times as bad as among crops sown the 3rd week in March, so that few, if any, oats will be obtained from the late sown crops.   At another centre, where the attack has not developed to such an extent, the damage to the late sown crops is approximately three times as great as in the case of the early sown.Black Currant Rustt Trials are being carried out with a view to discovering a suitable fungicide for use against this disease, which was exceptionally prevalent and severe last season.   There is already some evidence for believing that spraying with dilute lime sulphur in early summer will materially assist in warding off the disease, -LABOUR DIVISION.Recruiting. A return rendered by the County Agricultural Executive.-.7.*&quot;i.-Committees shews that from 23,000 to 24,000 men have already been found towards the quota of 30,000 men who, under the decision of the War Cabinet, are to be released from agriculture for military service before the 30th June, 1918.   In the conscientious effort to complete their quota, some counties are including highly skilled men such as shepherds, engine drivers, foremen, etc., who are quite irreplaceable, and a serious situation is arising in many districts owing to the insufficient number of skilled men who will remain. Other counties represent that it is impossible to complete their quota if they are to give any consideration to the question of maintaining cultivation in their area.
Harvest Labour.   The Department have not yet been Informed whethej^j the Ministry of National Service will be able to supply sufficient extra labour for the hay and corn harvests.     An arrangement hag &apos; been made with the War-Office by which about 10,000 to 12,000 additional prisoners will be placed at  he disposal of the Agricultural Executive Committees for harvest work.     8,500 of thej prisoners have already been allocated to agriculture, but are waiting until the premises in which they are to be housed are re These men will be sent out In migratory gangs, each gang consisting! of ten prisoners and two guards, and will be available to meet the requirements of those districts which are not served by any existing prisoner of war working camr*s..    Any prisoners in agricul-l tural camps who cannot be used in tho immediate neighbourhood for harvest work, and also prisoners employed on land reclamation work will be sent out in migratory gangs under this scheme.    Other Government Departments who are employing German prisoners are being approached with a view to the release in connection with the coming harvest of as many as possible of the prisoners employed on their work..Soldier Labour. An additional 272 soldiers were sent out to farmer - during the week, making the-total number of these men now out on farms 58,738Prisoners of foar.   Nine additional -agricultural prisoner campshave been opened during the week, making the total number of .prisoners now, employed on farm or drainage &quot;work: -as foilows:-Prom 210 agricultural camps.................... 12,058Employed from other camps .....................   1,008Combatant prisoners lodged on farms ...........     ^154Released ali/ms employed on agriculture......._1^912ts;tis147 additional schemes are now with the War Of f ic . jsrorif for the employment&apos; in agriculture of 8,470 extra prisoners, number&apos; of schemes, providing for the employment of 4,157 prisons? are also being suspended until further prisoners are available ft farm work.
War Agricultural Volunteers.   Information received from theAgricultural Executive Committees shows that a number of enquiries are being received from civilians as to the scheme for the enrolment of 7/ar Agricultural Voluntoors for work on the land.   A small number of theae men have already been enrolled and placed on farms.?,fomen&apos;s Branch.Recruiting.   The lieadxjuarter3 recruiting staff made a tour of the Bast Kent coast towns last week.   Tours are to be undertaken this week in varwickahire and Worcestershire, Gloucestershire and Somerset and in Lancashire and Cheshire.   Rallies have been held in Lowestoft, :?are, Ilkeley, Otlcy, Swansea and Kondal. Training.   The demand for labour is increasing rapidly.   A gang has been asked for in Foulness Island, Essex., and it is hoped to arrange a hostel on the line3 of the one established at Romney Marsh which has proved a success.Over 2,000 fruit pickers will proceed to &apos;7isbech during  1 the next week.Hostels have been opened at Bunbury Heath, Romney Marsh and Monmouth.60 women are now being trained in thatching, and arrange-ments have been made for 37 more to commence a similar training under the Forage Committee.12,135 women are accounted for in the Land Army asfollows:-On farm work     ...................     6,573Lent to Forage Department ........        178Lent to Timber Department........        187In Instruction Centres...........    2,290Waiting for references to beplaced in.

Nineteen new Institutes have been started during the past week.
OULTIVATION DIVISION. Stocktaking.   In consequence of the reorganisation of the Horse ,and Tractor-Schemes it has been necessary to arrange that Agricultural Executive Committees should take on charge, as from 1st July, 1918, all the machinery, implements, horses, &amp;c(; which have been consigned to counties.     This will necessitate a general stocktaking of the Department&apos;s property throughout the Country.     It is., therefore, proposed in future to require Committees to take stock of the Department1^ property in their charge on 30th June and 31st December in each year. Tractor Scheme.   The tractors, machinery and implements consign! during the week ended 15th June, and total oonsigned to date an as follows:-Tractors...................Ploughs.......................Cultivators 9/11 tine.......&quot; disc pattern ....Pressers, 3 ring...........Trail ers...................No. consigned to;counties during week.,25 28 16Total Mo.

Horse Scheme.   The,.following figures show the position with regard to the provision of horse-drawn implements for the week ended 15th Juno.     The figures have been revised and allowance made for failures of contractors to carry out instructions. Certain differences will, therefore, be observed between the present and previous statements.

Good results have been achieved during the week. Over 51,000 acres have been dealt with, the work being similar to-&apos; that of the previous week,Preparation for the,1918 Harvest.   77   binders were consigned during the week ended 15th&apos;June, making a- total of 3r2 2 eonaigned to date. 7 threshing machines were consigned waking a totaj. of 153 consigned to date,Seven counties were visited during the week and the Committees interviewed in order to ensure an adequate organisation for threshing the 1918 crop.    Practically the.whole of the country has now been covered *SUPPLIES DIVISION. Fertilisers. Returns are now available showing the; deliveries of fertilisers in the United Kingdom from the 1st June 1917 to 31st May 1918.   . The total quantity of sulphate ofi ammonia delivered for agricultural purposes during the year amounted to 234,000 tons, as compared with 149,000 tons in the preceding twelve months ended the 31st May 1917*    In the case of basic slag the. deliveries have amounted to just over,500,000 tons which is probably appreciably, more than was available in the preceding year.    Returns were not, however, collected prior tp the 1st January 1917,, so that no complete figures can be given.     In the case of superphosphate, it is Impossible to distinguish between the quantity of superphosphate sold as such for d^eel:, application to the soil and the quantity employed in the manufacture of compound manures. The nearest estimate which can be made is based on the total supply of
phosphate rock, which amounted to 446,500 tons, during the twelve I months. Deducting 56,500 tons used for munitions and industrial purposes, there remains 390,000 tons for agriculture.   This quantit if converted into superphosphatei would yield approximately 700,00( tons, and may be compared with a supply, estimated on the same basl of 535;000 tons in the preceding year. The quantity of compound manures delivered by manufacturers during this period, amounted to 450,000 tons. Probably 6$% of this total would consist of super-phosphate. On this assumption, the total supply of sulphate of ammonia, superphosphate, basic slag and compound manures during thi past twelve months has been not less than 1,800,000 tons, while, in addition, certain very limited quantities of nitrate of soda, potash and certain organic manures, have also been available. Exacl comparisons cannot be made with the deliveries of the preceding twelve months, but it is probable that this total is fully 300,000 tons larger than that of the previous year. gPotash. Information has been received from the Ministry of Munitioil stating that potash is now being produced at the Oldbury factory al the rate of approximately 50 tons per week.   This potash will be taken over from the Ministry of Munitions by the Department and sold direct to growers for use on potato and flax crops. Stable Manure. Deliveries from the Eelmoor dump near Aldershot are I proceeding satisfactorily.   The total quantity despatched during the year up to the 25th May 1918 amounted to 14,600 tons, of whichI 6,500 tons were delivered by barge.   At present 19 barges are at-work, and a proposal is under consideration to increase this numbe: to 31, with a view to increasing the quantity delivered and the area of distribution.Lime.   An endeavour is being made to obtain the exemption of men I employed in lime works by certifying the industry under Sectional I of the Military Service Act.   A deputation was received by the Ministry of National Service on this subject last week.
Binder Twine.    Arrangements have been made to supply binder twine to the binders controlled by the Agricultural Executive Committees. The Committees have been asked to state their requirements and arrangements are being made for distribution as rapidly as possible. Provision is being made, in addition, to meet those extra requirements &apos;0f dealers and merchants which usually arise during harvest time. Wart Disease of Potatoes.   Arrangements&apos; are being made for the inspection of growing crops of &quot;seed&quot; potatoes of immune varieties. Certificates indicating that the varieties are true to type will be issued in the case of those crops which are found satisfactory.Similar arrangements are being made by the Departments of Agriculture for Scotland and Ireland, and it is hoped that the purity of the most important part of the supplies of immune ^eed1 for, infected land will thus be determined before dispatch by the grower.4^MM Spraying.   The supply of nicotine is being Increased by the use of waste tobacco stalks, though the probable output obtained in-this way is not likely to be very great, as the nicotine content of this tobacco refuse is low.    There is evidence that the sale of Proprietary Spraying Mixtures has been very good this year.    The Ministry of Shipping has been asked to allocate space for the importation from America of a large quantity of grease banding material for use during the autumn.An increasing number of specimens&apos;of potato foliage alleged to be diseased has been received, but, with the exception of a very few isolated instances in Cornwall, no further cases of blight have been discovered.Seed Control.    The. Food Controller has agreed to the terms of a new Testing of Seeds Order drafted by the Department and accepted unanimously by its two Seeds Advisory Committees.    The Order,m   11   m
which will bo published immediately, widens the scope of that is3% last year, and applies to all the principal Jclnda of cereals, grass roots and vegetables.   The most important change is the inclusion0 cereals.   Up to the present date it has not been necessary in the case of &quot;wheat, barley, .oats and rye, for the seller to do more than state the name of the variety, without any declaration as to germination and purity. Farmers are 110 doubt, able in many cases to form a good opinion of the value of seed from handling, a sample, in recent experience with seed.sold by the Department has shov/h that) even highly trained experts are frequently misled as to its germinating power unless&apos;a laboratory test is made.   In future fain when selling seed for sowing, must have it tested, and either state that it is above a certain prescribed standard of germination, or give the actual percentage of germinating seed.   Growers need not have the test made, or make any declaration when they sell seeds uas grown&quot;, for re-sale after cleaning.   The new provisions will prevent the sale of inferior seed, and it is hoped will improve thJ average production of grain in this^country.   The germinating standards which have been selected are 90$ for wheat and barley, Qb% for oats and 80$ for rye.   These figures are not regarded as satisfactory, still less as a maximum, but simply a minimum below1 which the precise percentage must be given.Another innovation of great interest to allotment holders! and small growers is a requirement that pafekets of vegetable seeds! below a certain weight shall bear a,statement that the seed is abol or below the prescribed standard of germination. This is intended! to protect the buyer:without placing on the seller an undue amount I of clerical labour.Wide circulation will.be given to a leaflet setting ou^I the terms of the new Order, for the, guidance of farmers.&quot; Belgium1s Post-War Seed Requirements.   The Department is advising! the Inter-Allied Commission charged with this duty as to the supP1! of farm seeds to be provided on the evaouation of Belgium. The v-I
of the quantities required is about  2,000,000 at pre-war prices and over  4,500,000 at present prices.   Such a demand on an uncontrolled market might easily double present prices.    The requirements of the devastated districts of Prance if they cannot be supplied from that country&apos;s own resources would drive the prioe of seed to such a high level that English agriculturists would hare to abandon some crops, or grow them at a price which would mean extravagant charges to the consumer. .Arrangements are, therefore, in train for conferences between representatives of the Department and the Ministries of Agriculture of Prance, Italy and the United States in order to consider the establishment of international control of.prices, and the organising of increased crops of those kinds of seed which can be kept for two or more years without undue loss of germinating value.I &amp;m9Sir,Your1 &quot;Obedient Servant^D irector-Genera1AThe Rt* Hon, Powland 3, Frothero, M.P.
