Note by tho SecretaryThe following memorandum has been prepared by the Chief of the Air Staff&apos;.in connection y, 1th Imperial Mar Cabinet 19, iiinate 5.In forwarding the memorandum the Air Ministry state that letters are being addressed to the General Officer Commanding Royal Air Force in france, and to the General Officer Commanding South-Eastern Area, informing them of the views of the Cabinet with regard to tho bombing of Belgian towns, and of tho desirability of reducing to a minimum, subject to military necessity, tho dangers to the civilian population consequent upon the bombing of Belgian objectives.(intd).   M.P.A.K.2, Whitehall Gardens, June 25th, 1916..1. In dealing with the increase, decrease or cessation ofbombing operations into Belgium, the following facts must be taken into considerationi.   The present position of the Allied Line in IT-3. Franco and Belgium in relation to the Sea coast.id.   The effect of military concentrations in this area.iii,.   The unrestricted use of IIaval Bases in regard to submarine operations.iv.     The aerial bases for raids on England are on the Channel Ports.v. The strategic Railway centres of communication.vi. The actual Naval and Military losses already inflicted.vii.   The casualties to the Belgian population, the civildamage wrought and the general effect not only on the civil population but on the Belgian &quot;Military effectives2. The present position of the Allied line from Amiensto Nieuport lies between 30 and 40 miles from tae Sea Coast; in this conges tod area must exist not only depots of men, munitions and supplies, but all those 1attoral cemmunications which are an essential to the concentration of forces at. the threatened point.   Prom recent experience we have seen - that a concentrated attack has been able in its initial; stages to &quot;penetrate a considerable distance
z160.and in the oaae of thib congested area, such a thrust would paralyse the communications necessary to deal with It. . , To cope with such a situation- it is of paramount importance to harass continually, the area of possible concentrationby attacking the billets o  troops, the accumulation of munitions ana the centres of Railway activity.   It must be assumed that the enemy is fully alivo to the difficulties of this situation ana the only way to deal with it is by main-taining a continuous   -nd sustained offensive attitude. -It may be remarked here that the enemy, conscious of the congestion in the area behind our lines, will only retaliate in a larger decree, the answer is that here Immunity cannot be obtained by lacic of offense nor can we await retalia-tion.To gauge the importance attached by the enemy to such pieces as Ostend, Zeebrugge and Brugos we have only to study the Maval activities obtaining at these ports; at Ostend (not altogether blocked by E.M.S. &quot;Invictive&quot;) the &quot;Ateliers de la Marine&quot; (a repair shop for submarines and destroyera) the concrete submarine shelters, the seaplane station and the entrance to the Bruges canal; at Zsobrugge, the seaplsno station, the continual repair and work on trie lock gates and the main entrance to the Bruges Haval Bese; at Bruges, the docks abounding with repair material of all types, large numbers of floating docks, concrete shelters for some twenty submarines and the large directional W/T station.   Bombing operations against these places can to a certain extent, keep their activities under control and at least provide a drain on labour necessary to effect repairs.   Cease bombing and these places become one large centre of unrestricted naval activity unable to be dealt with by any other means, whilst the 1-Javal operations lately carried out against 3eebrugge and Ostend become non-ef:?ective.With regard to Bruges, it may be pointed out hers that the docks, the main bombing objective,, lie to the north of the town&apos;, which, in itself hss seldom sustained damage.The necessity of safeguarding the Channel Portsand London from aerial attack is self evident, but the only bases from which aerial attacks can be carried outlie importunately in Belgium; such places as St. Denis Westrom, Gontrode, Soheldewindeke, Oost&amp;cker, Mariakerke and Maria Aalter are notorious as aerial bombing bases and the most effective method of coping with such attacks must be the bombing of the actual bases themselves.The bsaia of military concentrations must depend on railway communications and theB8 certainly, in so far as Belgium is concerned, concentrate and.radiate from certain district centres, such as Ghent, Karnur and liege.   To hinder in the largest decree, movements of troops srid munitions, it is obvious&quot;that the host results will be obtained from attacking th-3 moist - important centres,   in the case of Ilamur, destroy the main railway bridge over the Mouse and the congestion of -movement consequent thereonmight very well be calculated to alter materially, the course of any operations dependent on this centre ofcommunications.   Ghent and liege are herdly loss important and to forego bombing- operations against these centres is to give to the enemy not only an  uninterrupted communication but a very considerable alleviation from nervous str&amp;in.
6* The efficacy of aerial attack might &quot;be disputedin comparison with civilian casualties and damage inflicted, wore it not for the numerous and copious reports received concerning the moral and mate rial effect of air raids oh the enemy&apos;o Naval and Military personnel, and material. There i?j ample evidence by which to chock re-suits, agents&apos; reports, captured correspondence, prisonersstatements, and above all, aerial photography, and the results obtained have been by no means insignificant.7. The other side of the picture, namely the casualtiesand moral effect inflicted upon the civilian population of Belgium, is a matter of no small importance   After nearly four years of oppression by the invader, there would bo little cause for surprise if the moral of the Belgian population, so veil sustained up to date,  should break and bring with it all the disadvantages accruing therefrom.   Again,- the birth of a feeling amongst the Belgian Military effectives, of alarm and despondency with regard to tho safety of their homos and their relations is an important factor and one v/hich cannot be omitted in reviewing the pro3 and cons of bombing operations.8. To obtain a correct view therefore of the wholesubject, one must pit against each other, on the- one hand the worst possible eventualities in the case of the Belgian population and its military forces, and on the other hand the immense advantages likely to accrue to the enemy by the cessation of bomb raids and their probable results.   Viewed in such a light, there can be little doubt that the latter * would be not only more disadvantageous to the cause of the Allies, but might well result in disaster.9. In conclusion, it must not be forgotten that onlythose objectives in Belgium of main Military importance are included in orders for attack and that rigorous instructions exist whereby ouch places as Antwerp and Brussels, in spite of the Naval and Military objectives which they contain are at present not allowed- to come within the sphere of aerial operations.   Indiscriminate bombing is not permitted, and it will be found, that th- majority of tho more important objec-tives lie clear of the thickly inhabited areas, as in the case of &quot;the Bruges Do ok 3, thou ;h Lio^., a very important point for attack forms an exception.Air Ministry,2rVth June, 1916.
