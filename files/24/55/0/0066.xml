This, document is the -oroperty of His Britannio Majesty^ Govt.S E 0 r e !p .&apos; WAR   CABINET.s&quot;. t. 4965.  r -the APPLICATION for AN increase in mr bonus to miners,Note by Mr. G.N.Barnes, covering memorandum by the Committee on Production.(See memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade, G.!E. 4959).i think it may assist my colleagues in arriving at the deci-sion,asked for by the President of the Board of Trade in his mem-orandum on the above subject, if they have before them a statement of the probable effect upon other industries, of conceding the advance for which the miners have applied.Accordingly, 1 circulate a statement which has been submitted&apos; to me on the subject, by the Committee on Production - the princi-pal arbitration authority in differences affecting the engineering and. shipbuilding trades.    This is the body best qualified to esti-mate. the probable effect on wages conditions in those trades, of a decision by the War Cabinet in favour of the miners11 claim.(Jn,)      G. n. b.2, lYhitehall Gdns, .27th. June 1918.PROPOSED ADVANCE Off V/AGES TO MINERS.(l) The Committee on Production presume   that the Government have in mind the effect upon other trades, of conceding the miners1 claim, instead of referring it, or possibly a part of it, to arbitration; c.nd that it has been decided that no attempt can be made to induce the miners to refer their claim to arbitration,&quot;(2) As the miners/have not, up to the present, received any equivalent to the 12-g-^L and have had advances under Sliding Scale agreements, not strictly attributable to cost of living, the grant ,o-f the l/6d. . ;er day to miners would not necessarily compel the Committee on Production to give the same advance to the men in the engineering and shipbuilding trades &apos;(3) The grant oi the. l/6d. to the miners, would undoubtedly make it impossible for the Committee on Production to avoid giving an advance to the engineers and shipbuilders, in response to the claims Which have been put before them to-day.(4-) An increase of l/6d. to the miners would certainly -influence the Committee on Production in the amount which they would give to the other trades.   -&apos;&apos;h.
