As the Minister x)f Labour mentions in Ms memorandum, the Resolution of the Parliamentary Committee cf the Trades ITnisn Congress was referred to the Pair Wages Advisory Committee but it should be noted that that Committee in its Report makes no recommendation in favour of the proposed change of poliqy, but merely describes the existing practice of Contracting Departments,3,     The memorandum states that ,!it appears desirable that the position of the Contraoting Departments should be strengthened in this respect% but there is no evidence that there is any general desire on the part of Contracting     Departments for such an extension cf the scope cf the Pair Wages Resolution^   Certainly, so far as the ^.?ar Office is concerned; nothing has occurred to suggest that the proposed change is necessary or desirable, or that the present practice has encouraged the existence *f any serieus or widespread abusesa44*     On the other hand, there is serious danger that the proposed chang?. would pro judicially affect the execution of Government contracts, sinoo it would tend to restrict the field cf competition by preventing many reputable firms from undertaking Government work, not because the labour conditionson
Ilon their private ^ork &quot;&quot;ill not &quot;bear examination, but because they prefer not to expose themselves to the liability of having their whole business and factory arrangements investigated by a Government enquiry whenever a disaffected workman chooses to lodge a complaint.     It may be argued that this liability already exists to some extent under the present system;   but it is one thing for a Department to laave a policy of strliving off its list at its own discretion a firm which is shown to be definitely ubad&quot; on its private work;   it is quite another for the Department to place all the firms -on its list in the position of being liable to be arraigned at any moment on the charge of failing in some particular respeot to observe the standard district conditions on their private work, and to bind itself to black-list any firm against whom such a charge is held to have been proved.    Firms whose Government work is limited to a particular department of their business or is relatively unimportant in comparison with their private trade are particularly likely to be deterred from undertaking Government contracts by these considerations, but these are the firms vhioh it is sound policy to encourage in preference to firms which exist -holly or mainly on Government work*-5.     Such a wide extension of the field of possible complaints must add greatly to the labour involved in the administration of the Fair r.rages Clause by Contracting Departments, especially where a firm serves more than one Department, and may possibly involve the institution of a special tribunal (either under the ministry of Labour, or independent of any Government Department) to adjudicate upon cases arising under the Clause,      Suoh a tribunal may easily be a source of considerable embarrassment to Contracting Departments if its decisions are liable to entail the blacklisting of, and immediate termination of all contracts held by Important, and perhaps Indispensable, contractors,6,    The wording of the amendment to the Fair Vfages Resolution proposed by the Minister of Labour, which requires contractors to wobserve the principles of the Resolution a3 regards rates of wages or ho urs&quot;of1abourw in respeot of their -private work, is ambiguous, and is likely to give&apos;rise to difficulties in administration.   Under the Fair &quot;fages Clause, contractors undertake, as regards their Government contracts, to&quot;observe and fulfil   the obligations&quot; specified in the Resolution   Is &quot;principles1&apos; intended to mean something less than &quot;obligations&quot;, and if so, what is the precise significance of the distinction?    In particular, would all awards made e*g, by the Committee on Production, and all rates fixed by Order of the Minister of Kunitions, automatically become payable under the terms of the amendment, on private as well as Government work?     I think any such course requires the fullest consideration before it is entered upon.29th June, 1&amp;13,
