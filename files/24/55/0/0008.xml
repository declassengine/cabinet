This nocument is theJPrc&quot; &apos;JM, i; . &quot;0-&apos;-/.(?&apos; PATRIOTIC CCHTHIBUTIC16D0RIHQ THE tfARU CHORA IT D TJ H DOniHXOl-T STATISTICIAN! QOVE-lilllENT OF CANADA FOR OIRCULATXOI! AT THE IMPERIAL T/AIi CABINET, 1918THE&quot;ST 6PATRIOTIC        F II H DThoPatriotic Fund was organised at the beginning of the war. At tho special session of Parliament hold in August 1914, an/ Act was passed providing for its organisation and incorporation. The Fund is designed to insuro that the wives and other dopendents of soldiers shall not suffer in a material way through the absence of the breadwinner.In addition to the Fund collected and disbursed under Dominion legislation, the Province of llanitoba organised at tho outset and instituted a Patriotic Fund on a separate basis under Provincial Statute and raised $ 2,311,292*1,1The disbursements of the Patriotic Pund are safely guarded and payments are made to the dependents of soldiers only after the strictest investigation into the validity of their claim.In many of the provinces legislation has been passed to permit municipalities to divert some of the taxes froiii -municipal purpose to the &quot;Fund&quot;.     In Ontario, particularly, many of the towns and rural municipalities have availed themselves of the opportunity thus offered and have made substantial contributions for this purpose.Pi   D        CROSS        SOCIETIES.The activities of       two related organisations are included under the above term - the Canadian and the British Red, Cross Society.The Canadian Red Gross Society is Dominion wide in its organi-sation,    Tho General Headquarters are at Toronto, with central offices located in each province.    Scattered throughout every province there are 637 local branches.The donations in cash to this fund have been the smallest part of the contribution made.     This is emphasized by the fact that about 100,000 bales and packages have been sent overseas, and several thousand packages have also been used in Canada,    To the contribu-tions of socks, sweaters, shirts, bandages, surgical supplies, etc.
must be added a large number of motor ambulances and field kitchens donated through this agency.

The activities of this organisation extended to the needs of all our Allies. At the present time the work of the Society is carried on with the greatest possible enthusiasm and energy; thousands of Canadian women meet every day at the various local centres to do Red Cross work.

BRITISH RED CROSS SOCIETY.

The work of this organisation was supported in Canada by two general appeals: the first in 1915, and the second the year following. In addition to the amounts shown in the attached statement, many contributions were made of which no record is available.

HOSPITALS

While all the provinces contributed to the "Canadian Women&apos;s Hospital", Haslar and Chatham, "Canadian Women&apos;s Ambulance", "Seamen&apos;s Hospital", "Greenwich, "Scottish Women&apos;s Hospital", "Luton House" and "Clarence House" for convalescent soldiers, "Duchess of Connaught Hospital", Cliveden, "L&apos;Hopital des Paroisses Canadiennes a Paris", and Queen Mary&apos;s Hospital, Shorncliffe, the province of Ontario is specially interested in and contributed generously to the "Ontario Military Hospital", Orpington and Coburg

BELGIAN RELIEF

Contributions to this Fund are largely in kind. During the first year of the war it required five large steamers to convey the contributions donated in Canada to Europe.

MISCELLANEOUS GIFTS

There is also organised effort to assist refugees from the invaded districts of France, for Polish and Jewish refugees, for work among the Serbian and Montenegrins expatriates.

The "Canadian Field Comfort&apos;s Commission" and the "Canadian War Contingent Association" have also been largely contribu? to.

There, however, remains untablulated and untabulatable value of the millions of boxes and parcels of soldiers comforts forwarded overseas. Consistent efforts are still being made to ke? all these projects running as going concerns. Each year the Patriotic Fund, Red Cross and Y.M.C.A. military work make the appeal to the public and receive generous response from the savings of the people, and will continue to do so until victory has been achieved.

The attached Table summarizes the data up to December ? 1917 far all funds except the Patriotic Fund, which shows a total contribution to April 30th 1918 of $38,575,000. and an expenditure of over 30 million dollars.
