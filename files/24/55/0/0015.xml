Colonel I. Dally Jones.(THIS DOCUMENT 13 THE 1&apos;RQIBRTY OX&apos;1 HIS BgmffllG MAJESTY&apos;S^gOVEmOigfTj^TREATMENT 01-&apos; DISABLED SOLDIERS IK CANADA......   dura from the Department of cioldiersT CivilRe-establishment, Government of Canada, for ; circulation at the Imperial War Cabinet, 1918).The work of the Commission was organised and divided into the following principal branches, - Military, Medical, Vocational, Works, Commissariat, Purchasing, Stores, Accounting, Records and Statistics, Publicity, and Employment.   The v/orks branch of the Commission has since been transferred to the Department of Public Works, which latter department,will in future carry out hospital, construction, alterations - and repairs.After experience gained in handling the work by the Commission, especially owing to the length of the war and the vMBltattfe development of the work, it was considered necessary -to create a new department of the Government called The Department of Soldiers^ Civil Re-establishment under the direction and control of which The Invalided Soldiers1 Commission has been placed.   The new department is charged with the provision of  , hospitals,&apos; convalescent homes and sanatoria, whether permanent or temporary, for the care of invalided officers, non-commissioned officers and men, or other members of the Canadian Expeditionary Force who have been honorably discharged; the administration of hospitals, vocational training, the provision of employment; and all matters relating to pensions for members of the Canadian Expeditionary Porce,The Commission under the direction of .the new department will continue to develop the Vocational branch, and to establish a distinct medical service of its own, and will also arrange to secure closer co-operation with the various provincial Commissions charged with the duty of providing employment for returned men.   In this way, although some branches of the Commission1s activities have been transferred, it is considered that there is likely to be little if any diminution in the volume of work undertaken.RETURNED ISM.The total number of men returned to Canada from March 31st, 1917, to idarch 31st, 1918, was as followsInvalids........25,238.	318	60044.

FUNCTIONALOiring to the changes in the systems of keeping records made by thie Mil itia^Departmsnt the Commission cannot furnish a complete analysis of the men tm^y^^fitm *s-ve*w*ic to date..The total number 6f patients (Overseae, Camp, Furlough etc,) treated by the Commission from March 31st, 1917, to March 31st, 1918 was 30,389.BROCtollKS REGARDIUG ^ETt3RHSD MEN.the Oommission has now no control of the men until they are finally discharged from the Forces,&apos; eo that the arrangements for handling them prior to this are entirely in the hands of the Military authorities.All N.C.0,8, and men are placed by the Medical Board examining them into one of three categories, namely:-,1.   3?it for service In Canada.2.   Temporarily unfit, requiring further hospitaltreatment; 3.   Unfit for service - for discharge.The Clearing Denote now, but not formerly, under the control of the Militia Department perform important   functions in receiving the men, classifying,&apos; and boarding them medically; securing much data for record and other purposes, chiefly to assist in re-instating the men in civil life;   issuing advances of pay; and finally arranging for the transportation and distribution of the men to their several military districts.ANALYSIS OF IFVALIDS HBTURKBD TO CANADA.An analysis has been made of the 6,960 invalids returned to Canada from July 1st to September 30th, 1917. and they are classified in the Report as to their various disabilities.    War wounds and injuries head the list with 32$; muscle., joint and bone oases come second with 18^; and nervous and mental cases come third with 10$,ACCOMMODATION.The summary of the accommodation provided in the various institions throughout Canada gives the total ,.j.umber of beds under construction or authorised as 17,934.    In the past the Commission has &quot;been able to maintain be4s in excess of requirements and no doubt is anticipated that it will be possible to continue this condition.BXBENDITUHBS etc.Authorisations for expendituressince the creation of the Commission up to the end of April 1918 total $14,611,494, the actual expenditures being  12,508,682.     It is noted that there has been a steady Increase In the cost of operation, due to the increasing number of men returafr^. construction of new hospitals, and the greater demands for vocational training and re- education.
: FlftTCTIOKAL ^EDUCATION.  &quot;Functional re-education has now been firmly established in Canada, as in several European countries,, as a^tiierrapeutio method of prime importance in conserving and restoring the plryKlial^and mental powers of disabled soldiers.    Experimental and resonrohVcw^ in this connection has achieved positive and splendid results.    BI^ strides have been made.    Of the first 200 cases handled 150 have improved satisfactorily and 50 have been groatly benefltted after about two month&apos;s work,VOCATIONAL TRAIKIHG.The vocational branch of the Commission is administered by a specially qualified staff and is well organised.    Tho general policy is to provide as wide a variety of vocational and re-education-al coursos as possible, and various centres of re-oducation with special equipment have been provided at various points in the DominionIn Canada on December 31st, 1917, there were 757 discharged mon and 187 undischarged mon, total 944 men, taking ro-oduoational coursos.    There aro now in Canada 2,010 convalescents taking vooa-tional training, v/hich does not includo some 200 men doing beside handicraft work.    3,684 men have been interviewed for ro-education, and 3,969 have been approved for ooursos.    There arc 1,807 courses in progress at the present time and 248 men havo completed their training.    A list is furnished in the report of 179 occupations for which disabled soldiers are at present being trained.A suitable scale of pay and allowances has been fined for men undergoing re-education, and tho pension scale has been increased to meet the higher cost of living.INDUSTRIAL TRAINING *Formerly it was the policy of the Commission to train all dis-ablod soldiers in schools rather than in industrial establishments. Enquiry, however, revealed that a&apos;great mumber of industrial oocupa-tions were open for disabled men, and openings have boen secured for training thorn.    The number of mon being trained in industrial establishments is increasing every day, which moans that tho transi-tion from the status of pupil to that of a regular wage-oarnor will be easy, as tho men increase in proficiency rapidly.The problem of providing employment for returned soldiers has been facilitated by the provincial commissions.    By arrangement with tho Governments of the sereral provinces, employment Commissions havo boen established in every province, and commendable work has been done by them./       -   BLIBPgP SOLD IDES. &apos;- &apos; .The Commission has the names of 47 blind men, some of whom have already completed training in England - the balance have been takon care of in Canadian institutions.
OTTAWA lay, 1916.BMP SOLDIERS.Of the returned men the number totally deaf is not large, provision is made for lip-reading instruction to be&apos; given to those who desire it,ARTIFICIAL LIH3S etc,A factory for the manufacture of artificial limbs for those suffering amputation injuries is maintained by the Commission.   Improvements and expansions in this work have taken place.   To date&apos; the number of amputation cases reported is well under 1,000.   Up to March 31st, 1918, the Artificial Limb factory had made and supplied 660 limbs * 4$2 le^s and 98 armo.   The factory to*day has about 375 limbs &apos;under construction.THE INSANE,The Commission operates one hospital for the care of the insane, and has made arrangements with the provincial Governments for institutional care in the institutions owned and controlled by them.TUBERCULOSIS.A very important part of the work which has devolved upon the Commission has been that pertaining to the care of men suffering from tuberculosis.   Up to March 31st, 191 fl, the Commission has dealt with&apos;&quot;3,648 men suffering from tuberculosis, and of these 1,619 were under^oin^ treatment on that date.Twenty institutions at various points throughout Canada are used by the Cormiission for the care and welfare of these patients.RSCK5ATI0N CENTRES.A recreation building has been incluued at all the larger institutions equipped by the Commission,   The healthy recreation provided in various forma proves an important part of the curative pro,gramme.SfltTO DEVELOPMENT OP WORK.Various proposals are now under consideration to ensure the success *f demobilisation work which is considered to be, next to winning the war, the most important war problem to be faced.The non*invalided men who will return at the close of the war have been divided, roughly, into three classes, namelyStudents, business and professional men  2,75$Artisans&apos; * e.g.&apos; skilled workers . *    .,   ..  ,&apos;. 43.98$ Hand labourers - occupation requiringmuscular effort *      33.33$As doubtless there will be a large demand for unskilled labourers for various building operations, ^farms, etc., at the close of the war it is thought that there should be no difficulty in absorbing the men in olass three, but it is con* aidered likely that the Government will have to arrange to give a period of special training to many of the men in class two.
