Confidential..Political Intelligence Department,* 22nd June, 1918.Foreign Office.&apos;   De:THE ICELANDIC PREMIER ON THE INDEPENDENCEDenmark/004.F0/ ICELAND. (see(see Memorandum Denmark/003)(The Icelandic newspapers are not received in the P.I.D., but the following has been communicated by a reliable informant).The Reykjavik newspapers of May 31st contain reports of the speech made in the Alting (Parliament) on May 30th by Jon Magnusson, the Prime Minister of Iceland, in answer to an interpellation relative to the summoning of the Alting for an extraordinary session on April 10th.The Minister said the main reason for summoning the Alting was the question of the Icelandic flag.     He approached the King with regard to.this matter before the ordinary session of the Alting in the summer of 1917, but no hope of its use being sanctioned was then held out to him.   Thereupon the Alting. by a jioint and unani-mous resolution, decided to press this question to a final solution.When on November 22nd, 1917, the King refused his sanction, the Icelandic Government should, according to constitutional usage, have placed their resignations in the hands of His Majesty, but it was found.to be inadvisable to do so between sessions since Parliament must deal with the new situation.     The royal veto alone fully justified the summoning of Parliament at the earliest moment practic-able.   It could, not be summoned earlier because of Polar ice and other difficulties.,It had been said, stated the Premier, that we.ought to have waited for the end of the war before we settled the question of the flag.     But it is just in these hard times that we sorely need theindependence is ingrained in our people from their origins and since the middle of the nineteenth century we have been engaged iniP*ight to sail the seas under our own&apos; flag.irThe demand for
a continuous struggle for- &quot;thejrecognition of our sovereign right to rule all our own affairs.   Our demand is irresistible now that the world is at war on behalf of the rights of the small nations.VThen Denmark refused sanction, the Danes suggested general Danish-Icelandic negotiations.   He did not accept that suggestion, but maintained that the question of the flag was a purely Icelandic matter that could not be part cf any negotiations.     He refused t^ take the initiative in Iceland in connection with the suggested negotiations.   It was then proposed, that Denmark, should send a delegate to Reykjavik to negotiate with the Alting, and this he thought more acceptable.When he returned to Iceland,&apos; he consulted members of the kiting *   At first reluctant, they finally consented to make another attempt to negotiate about the uniin with Denmark, if the Danes would send a delegate or delegates to meet the Alting in Reykjavik. It was quite untrue, as stated in the Danish press, that Iceland took the Initiative in respect of any kind cf negotiations.When the views of the members of the Alting were wired to the, anish Government, they declared that the result of the approaching Jeneral Election to the Folketing must be awaited before any further tops were taken.   This surprised him, as he Eoad not known that fjhis matter tfas a party question in Denmark, though it was now seen o be so.   Even if he had known it he would not have delayed the ailing together of the Alting.It had been said that we had offended the Danes by deciding p settle the question of the flag now and that they had not deserved is of us since they had assisted us in various ways.     It was true ey had supplied us with necessaries such as sugar and rye-meal at hwer prices than we could get them elsewhere:   also with ships and *ans of money through the good offices of the Danish Premier and lance Minister.     Mr Scaveniuss the Foreign Minister, had assisted
us to buy a steamer in Sweden and he had rather favoured than hampered the concluding of direct agreements with other nations by ourselves.   Tie fully reco gnise all this, but it cannot in the slightest degree detract from:  our just and right demands and claims for independence, and I am sure no such concession is expected from us.The latter part of Mr&apos; Magnusson&apos;a speech dealt with the economic difficulties of Iceland.i ..............................Notes of the P.I.D.During the debate on Iceland&apos; in the Danish Folketing on June 1st Mr 2ahle in submitting to both Houses of the Riksdag a resolution to the effect that a Committee should be appointed &quot;by each House to receive from the Cabinet information in regard to the negotiations[with Iceland and thereupon to make a report and recommendations,mj remarked on the extraordinary development in Iceland during the last &apos; S.fifty years and the consequent growth of national feeling and wish If or a further political development.      After a recapitulation of I the various discussions regarding the Danish-Icelandic relations which pave taken place since 1903, he stated that special circumstances tendered it possible that negotiations might succeed in smoothing iaway difficulties and lead to a lasting understanding.J.C. Christensen, the Liberal Leader, said that he had small pope of any result from the proposed negotiations though no ways (towards an agreement must be left untried.   It would be a misfortune to all Scandinavia if Iceland were-to become dependent on any other lation, but the Danish-Icelandic Union must be real, not a sham.IA telegram of the 14fh of June to &quot;the &quot;Times&quot; from Copenhagen tates that three parties of the Danish Diet are agreed &amp;s to the esirabllity of an immediate discussion leading to a settlement of
