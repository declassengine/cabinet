1^05itMEMORANDUM TO THE WAR CABINETFROM THE MINISTER OP INFORMATIONON THE SUBJECT OF PERIODICAL PUBLICATION IN AMERICA _i     OF TOTAL CASUALTIES IN THE BRITISH ARMY. _.I wish to plaoe before the War Cabinet the question of issuing a periodic list of total casualties in the British Army for circulation in the United States.Information received from America lays great stress, on the utterly false impression prevailing there of the proportion of the fighting In France done by troops from the United Kingdom.    The continual references to the performances of troops from the Dominion produce on the American mind the idea that these are doing most of the fighting, and bearing moat of the losses.     Such an impression has a very bad effect on the American view of Greai Britain, and the situation will not improve as big lists of American casualties begin to come in, and are published.I am taking various steps to meet this difficulty, but I believe cne of the most effective would be the periodic publication of our total casualties.     I approached the Secretary of State for War on the subject, and he has replied that he would have no objeo-tion to the publication of our total casualties up to a certain date, and subsequent publications from time to time, but that he could not take such a step without the consent of the War Cabinet. I would therefore ask that the War Cabinet give the requisite   . authority to the Secretary of State for War, and the Minister of Information to make this publication by joint arrangement between themselves.BEAVERBROOK.25th. June, 1918.
