Downing Street, S,1.?., on June 24th,. 1918.Mi KEKBHSKY said that he had come to England for&apos; the special purpose or clearing up the relations between Russia and the Allies.   He claimed that he could speak for the whole of Russia except the reactionaries and the Bolsheviks.   These last were the only sections in Russia which were anti-ally,&apos; Ho said that he had been definitely authorised to come- by all those elements in Russia, which, stood for life in Russia and which were active politically.   He then proceeded to enumerate the organisations for which he could speak in addition to himself.   He laid emphasis on tiu- fact that these included&apos; the elements of socialist opinion next door to the-Bolsheviks.&apos;On the 18th  May. last this Body.passed a Resolu-tion the substance of which was as follows:--&apos;Je consider ourselves in.a state of&apos;war-with Germany and we do not consider the Brest-Litovek Treaty valid.   VTo consider it possible to re-&apos; construct an $astern front with.the help of the Allies.   vrt v-i^ to continue in the Alliance, not as a territory or people, which is powerless and helpless but as an-equal, partner with the democratic nations of the West.-(2)   Conference of Party Leaders of the Socialist. Revolutionaries. .(3)   popular Socialist party.(4). Social Democrats (except Bolsheviks.)(5)   The Cadet Party which among the non-socialist partiswas the most powerful ana.Included the whole of the non-socialist Intelligentisia repre-senting especially the small landowners, the merchants and to 3ome extent the small shop-keepers though a section Of these last were reactionary.   He al3o considered that up to tht present the majority of the -officers took tht view which he represented.&apos;M. Koronsky said that recent events had erased many lines of demarcation nnd eliminated many prejudices in Russia.   In the matter of intervention the Russia for which he could speak spoke with a united voice.   The sections which he represented regarded the question of intervention as if it were simply one of the continuation of military operations.   They regarded the events of the last ei*ht months 3imply as though they were the consequences of a rupture of the Russian front.   Nobody in theappendix staining solution.(i)The Executive 0omiait,tet  of;the Constituent,AssemblyThis Conference passed: a similar Resolution-to that which is quoted. .
Went could imagine what Run-in had had to buffur.during this time   Tho go events however- did not alter In the least their views in regard to the international relations and obligations of Russia.,   He had come ovr because he wanted definite know-ledge from tho Western Allies as to where they stood as regards Russia,(  Tho present moment was very urgent because there was a rapid&apos; increase In Germanophilc tendencies- among tho represent-ativos of the Right.,   Action was urgently needed.THE PRIME MINISTER asked if this repreonted the views of the majority- -; of the Russian peopleBM.rKEREHSxLY replied that it did in this sense: - that&quot; the bulk of the Russian, -people were now against/Germany and:her agents.   Russia was very tired.   She had suffered more than any other nation.&apos; Her.,economic conditions were deplorable..   It-was therefore true that there was no strong desire for more fighting but&apos; tho masses of the Russian people were now definitely antI*German.*Mi Kerensky went on to say that he would have come before if he had thought it desirable.   He had come now because he thought that the.conditions were favourable to action.* When-asked what.-.he thought that the Allies could do he replied i; &quot;immediate intervention&quot; by.which he meant the restoration of an Eastern military front;. There were many people in the West who talked as if economic assistance was what Russia needed.-He admitted that the economic aspect was important, but those whom he represented did not put it in the first place.   The first thing was to establish what were the relations between Russia and the Western Allies from the political and moral point of view. , He protested in fact against the idea that tho only thing which the Allies ought to do was to help Russia with money, boots and so forth.THE PRIME MINISTER then asked what was his view about Japanese inter-vention.M. KBRENSKY replied that the people whom he represented were against - Japanese intervention but in favour of Allied intervention. He said that thoy could not accept intervention by the Japanese alone,, but that if the military operations were conducted by the&quot; Allies according, to plans worked out by the Allies it did not matter what percentage of the force was Japanese.-   If inter--vention could take the form of being a renewal of active Russiroi military operations in, conjunction with tho Allies directed against Germanythe objections to Japanese participation from the point of view of Russian public opinion would be still smaller *THE PRIME MINISTER then asked whether the friendly elements InRussia would regard intervention with favour even If the great proportion of the troops used were Japanese. -saidM, KERENSKY/that he had come here to -clear up this very- point.;- - What he&apos; and his friends wanted to know was whether there wasa chance of military assistance being given.   If not they would then have to consider their position.THE PRIME MINISTER ssked If there were any Russian troops who couldCo-operate In the event of intervention..-He asked these -&apos;-   questions because the information which the British Government : V   got from Russia was hopelessly conflicting.. -ftU KERENSKY said that one of his primary purposes was to give authoritative information.   He came as a responsible person futhoriseel to speak by those whom ho represented.- He considered himself and tho group which he represented as being still the
w* 3&quot;*All id B of the Western powers and thoy would give all the help they could.   During the last few months all those parties had been busy creating forces, appointing special offioers, ond creating military organisation.   Whan ho left Russia all these organisations were in oontact with ena another.THE PRIMS lllttI3TER  asked if many of these leaders had not been arrested during the recent Bolshevik coup.-U. EBHEHSgY could not spoaJfc for oertain os he had had no 1 oonmiunicatioris since he left but he, did not think the Bolsheviks could deal a heavy blow against these organisations.   Their power in a military sense was negligible but they wore strong enough as a police foroo to daal with a powerless and unorganised population, largo play had been made in the Fast with tno Bolshevikexperinanta in tho oroation of the Red Guards, compulsory military service and so forth, but in practice thesemeasures produced no results.   He said that tho influonoeof tho Bolsheviks was waning and ho instanced ee evidenceof this that an anti-Bolshevik organisation had recentlyboon formed amongst the workmen in Petrograd and Nijni-Novgorod.   To-day ho saw from the papors that a similarorganisation had just been formed in Moscow.   Ho regardedthat se very significant especially as there was now muchsuffering among the industrial population owing to the foott)iat Industrial life was praetioelly dead.   He ooulddefinitely state that tha Bolsheviks could not rely uponany organisation in Russia except their own.THE PRDffi asked whether if there was intervention in&quot;$ioeria it would ba opposed by the local population.JL ggREHSKY said that it depended upon tho form in which it took r     plaoo.&apos;  Siberia was now opposed to tha Bolsheviks.   On tho subject of intervention he pointed out that tha Germans had intervened in ths Ukraine and other parts of Russia on tha ground that they were invited by olomonte of the local population,   The result however had been the opposite of what Germany had anticipated.   Among tho masses of ths population in tho Ukraine thera was after tho Revolution the same sort of fooling against all Governments.   All Govarn-rnonts ware the ennmy including the Russian Government.   How however they were rapidly learning what German domination meant.   Intense hatred of tho Germans was $rowing up and there was gorilla warfare everywhere,   To-day tha Ukraine was oaipactiag Russia to help her to gain freedom from tho Germans.THS PRIMS MIfllfrTER asked whether they exposted it from M.Trotsky. M.  BREflSKY No. from Russia,THE PRIM MINISTER asked what was the attitude of the Russian Church on this matter.M. iCSRyiSIflj&apos; said that it wa3 not much int eras tod in politics.   Tha prlasts did not interfere very much in politics and did not count for so much as in Roman Catholic countries,   Ihiring the period of the Provisional Government religion was at a discount. 3ow it was reviving and it was definitely snti-Bolshevik,THE PRIviE MINISTER asked if there was much patriotic   foellng among the masses of the Russian peasants in regard to the partition affected by the Treaty&quot;of Brest-Litovsk.   Whether tha masses of tho population felt about tha loss of the old Russian Provinces as would say a ITostem country like France?
?. KERENSKY replied that the Brest-Litovsk Treaty has done what the Provisional Government had been unable to do. It had created a real patriotic sentiment in Russia. It is clear to the educated that Russia could not exist without outlets to the sea and it was clear to them that if Russia was going to continue to exist acquiescence in the Brest-Litovsk settlement was impossible. In regard to the masses it was necessary to distinguish between patriotic feeling and willingness to act. The feeling was now there even if the desire for action was much loss.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that as he had often stated in public it was the wish of the Allied Powers to stand by the Russian democracy to the end. If they knew that Russia was a real partner in the Alliance they would supply her with munitions and all other resources to the utmost of their power. It was certainly not their intention and desire to make a peace at the expense of Russia. From the practical point of view however they were in a position of great difficulty. The ? facto Government in Russia was apparently as hostile to the Allies as it was to Germany.

?. KERENSKY asked if this meant that the Allies could do nothing as things stood at present.

THE PRIME MINISTER repeated that so long as the do facto Government stood in its present position the situation was extraordinarily difficult for the Allies. If there was a Government in Russia which was willing to extend its hand to the Allies they would help it with food arms and in every possible way. But what could they do so long as the only Government which existed in Russia appeared to be just as friendly to the Germans as it was to the Allies.

?. KERENSKY said that from the point of view of the people he represented it was not a question of renewing relations at all it was one of Russia fulfilling her obligations as an Ally. From their point of view what had happened was that Russia had suffered a very serious military defeat. They did not however consider themselves defeated. The Germans had won a great victory but they had not ended the war. What they wanted to know was whether they could expect help from the Allies in continuing the war.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that if there were any elements in Russia which were prepared to fight Germany the Allies would give them all the help in their power.

?. KERENSKY said that he had come to say that in the event of Allied intervention there would be no opposition. It was essential however that he should know what were the intentions of the Allies and what he and his friends could expect. If the Allies were willing to help it would be necessary for further conversations to take place in regard to military, economic and other preparations in Russia itself.

THE PRIME MINISTER said he was very glad that he had this conversation, it was a very important conversation. M. Kerensky however would understand that decisions in this matter were necessarily Allied decisions and before he could say anything further it would be necessary for him to consult with his Allies. He was probably going to a meeting in Paris next week and he suggested that ?. Kerensky should go there first and state his views to ?. Clemenceau.


m ,&quot;p&quot;   mH. ICSKSITSICY   said that ho wanted in conclusion to emphasise one or two. 1 joints.    First,, and most important, that ho could, absolutely guarantee that at the present moment Russia was on the eve of national regeneration.    It. was of the utmost importance that Russia should-know whether tho Allies were with her or not%    He had come over to ascertain this...    The political consciousness of Russia was ripe for tho movement,    They would find military forces, themselves. They could either move with Allied support or they could make a last effort and die by themselves.    Consequently, it was necessary to take&apos; a definite and decided step soon against Germany or it would be too late,    Russia was in-a state of tremendous expectation,;    If nothing came of Iris visit Russia would either sink into hopeless apathy or the friends of Germany would gain tho ascendency and draw Russia further into the German orbit.This represents the main thread of the interview,.     In addition, however, M,-. Kerensky made a number of remarks in regard to inftividuV als, etc of some interest,    He said that recently Germany had tr.ie:d to get into touch with the Cadets in order to do business with their^ TJhile a section of the Cadet Party was prOrGerman, the Party as a whole refused,Rodzianko, the old President of the Duma, was an Octobrlst, Some of his collaborators were working with the Germans in the South, but he did not think that Rodzianko himself had any dealings with them,Mliukoff was a party to the views which II, Kerensky represented. He did hot of course share his views on internal politics, but LI, Kerensky represented him so far as the international problem was concerned,As to Gutohkoff.. he had no very definite information.    A $oo&amp; many of the commercial aristocracy of Moscow had Gorman affiliations,Tseretelli was in the Caucasus.    The last news that he had of him was that he was working for the maintenance of tho Russian connection in the Caucasus,JVs to tho Bolsheviks, ho did not think that Lenin was pro-Germain    Prom practical experience, however, in regard to Trotsky during his own period of power, he thought that at that time he was Germanophile,    This, however, did not necessarily mean that he was Germanophile at present.    llf Kerensky also said that he had como across the C z echo^Slevaks when he was on the Eastern Front, and that they were a very good body of fighting men.   , In regard to the dynasty, hie private information tended to&apos;show that it was not GermanophiXe, but that the Court party and tho bureaucracy undoubtedly were,Tho Note attached as an Appendix is Text of Resolution referred to on firct page.2S t*&quot;     With reference to above, Mr, -,P-. Eurr had an interview withM. Kerensky on, the morning of the 25th Juno, at which various further pointe wore m&amp;dc oloarq    A note of this interview ic being circulated as G,T, 4948 U).
APBaEDIX.. ;3?he following resolution was adopted by tho Inter-Party Council of the Consx-ltont Assembly on the 18th May, 1918. For obvious reasons it could not appear in the Russian Prose nor could it have boon transmitted.by wire.&quot;The ,)rest-Mtavslc Peace has placed Russia in a particularly awkward international position..- The German influence in Russia is growing continually stronger and its tendencies are clearly shown by the example of the Ukraine. One district after another falls into the hands of the invader, our much divided country is faced by the menace of ^further conquest plans and this menace may any day become a reality. At the -some time.the alarming rumours concerning a Japanese descent in the Russian Far East grow ever, more persistent.:t) 1 the eve ox events in the Far East which must in-exorably come upon our country, vhen Russia is becoming the field of a bloody struggle-, the :&quot;Ifter--Party Council&quot; - the on^y representative of the All-Russian Constituent Assembly -again make the following declarationThe Brest Mtovsk Treaty is not recognised by our .country;   Russia was and continues to be in a state of war with Germany and the bonds uniting us with the Allies cannot be:considered as invalided by the action of a government Which is not recognised by Russia.At. the same time the Council-declares that the Russian nation &quot;Fill never acquiesce &quot;in a -violation of the sovereignty of.Russia by the Allied Powers, or in an occupation of Russian territory, or in an interference in the internal affairs of Russia.     The appearance cf Allied troops oh Russian territory can only be admitted by Russia with her consent for the strategl purposes of a struggle against Germany carried on together with&apos; Russian forces, and on condition that the action should be taken in common by all the Allied powers.&quot;(The Inter^Party. Council of the All Russian Constituent Assembly was formed after the dissolution of this body by the Bolsheviks in order to represent and act on behalf of the Assembly.     It consists.of representatives of the under-mentioned party groups forming together a considerable majority of the Assembly        tho Social Revolutionary, tho Moslem Socialists, the -Social-Democrats, the United Labour, the United Jewish Socialists, tho Toil and Popular Socialist and the International1st.)
