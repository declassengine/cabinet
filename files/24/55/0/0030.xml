(this Doc Hi his britanni)perty MOflCl U, Mlj johliy&apos;s GovernmeiConfidential.Political Intelligence Department,June 21st, 1918.Foreign Office.AUSTRIA/00\, t)DISORGANISATION   iii   AUSTRIA.Evidence of complete disorganisation in Austria, and especially in Galicia, is multiplying.    The   Polish papers are full of accounts of robberies committed by deserters, many of them in a most audacious manner.     One of their most usual tricks is to put on officers&apos; uniforms forge military orders and then simply &quot;requisition&quot; the tilings they need.     Thus, for instance, at Sddowa Wisznia, one of the main stations on the Lemberg-Przemysl railway line, a deserter in officer1suniform assumed the&quot;military command&apos;of the station and was able for several days to remove victuals from railway cars.    West of Rzessow on the same railway line a gang of robbers used practically every night to get at goods trains, terrorising the railway service with revolvers and daggers.    The leaders of that gang were caught on June 2nd and were found to be deserters from the army.    It is supposed that the entire gang consists of deserters. ,   It ought to be noticed that the railway from which these different robberies are reported is one of the most important lines in Eastern Europe; the Berlin-Constantinople and Vienna-Odessa trains run over it.The &quot;Czas&quot; of June 4th publishes an article from what seems to be a very we11-informed correspondent on the position of Galician agriculture and conditions in villages.    The i;Czas;5 is the paper of the big landed aristocracy of Western Galicia, and the article seems to be -smitten by a member of that olass.    In any ease any article in the &quot;Ozas&quot; deserves attention - this is not a sensational paper which would publish news from uncertain sources. The article contains the following paragraph:-
&quot;The conditions of public safety (in Galicla), which are getting worse every day, are a source of alarm. In different wooded districts entire gangs of deserters are assembling; they hide in them and make them the base for expeditions in search of food and clothing. The wooded districts of Lezajsk (some thirty miles north of Przemysl) is now infested by a gang of a hundred deserters.For the last six weeks crowds of Russian prisoners of war fleeing Kome have been moving from west to east. Compelled by Hunger these prisoners enter the villages situated near the forests in search of food, and the terrified inhabitants give them whatever they can without demanding payment for fear that if the food is not given voluntarily these men will take much more by force.    The constables, although occasionally informed about fleeing prisoners of war, do not even attempt to catch them.    To-wards the end of April   these prisoners were coming mainly from Hungaryj it is said that they are driven out from there threatened by the local labourers vino are rcivvt.&apos;..:^ from Russia, and who are afraid of the competition of the Russian prisoners of war.     In May they began to go from Moravia, Silesia and Western Galicia. * Now they boldly follow the roads, and almost every village has Russian guests for the night who, generally speaking, provided that they   are fed,, do hot give any ground for complaint, and so far nothing has been heard of bigger robberies committed by them.&apos;    The example of the hundreds and thousands of men fleeing back to Russia is contagious for the&apos;prisoners who still remain at work.     Many have already gone, and those who remain say that they will all go as soon as the young potatoes are sufficiently big Jfcr them to dig and feed on.11(Here follow 50 lines deleted by the censor.)With this information might be compared that con-tained in Sir Horace RumboldVs despatch of June 7th, 1918, No.451, 104204, enclosing the letter from Dr. Parodi about Sawnl Bey wtib, having brought the Turkish diplomatic bag from Constantinople to Berne, said that he would not do so again because of the^difficult-ies met with in travelling through Austria.     &quot;The trains are Invaded by soldiers and civilians who crowd the oorridors.-and refuse to pay for their places.&quot;
