The British Delegates consider this inadequate and aro insisting m the repatriation in addition of some britich combatants now interned in Gormany.Tho reason for an exchange Is to get as many British Prisoners freed from the sufferings they endure In Germany as possible. Tho repatriation of some of our prisoners interned in Holland does nothing to fulfil this object.The number of British Interned in Holland is 608 Officers&apos;and 3801 other ranks*The number of German civilians interned in England is approx-imatoly 21,000.   In addition approximately 11,000 German civilians are ftS-i^wawilt over seas within the British Empire.The number of British civilians internod in Gormany is approx-Imatcly 3.300. ,Of theso about 2,000 belong to tho Mercantile Marine which Germany has up till now insisted on considering as combatant prisoners.   The civilian prisoners may therefore only number 1,300 as against Germany&apos;s 21,000 or 32,000.If Germany intends to adhere to an agreement not to employ repatriated&quot; prisoners in the battle line there is no valid objection against civilians being exchanged for combatants head for head. The civilian os possibly being skilled in a trade may be the moro valuable of the two.   Germany&apos;s refusal to exchange civilians for combatants Is pvoop that In some way she intends to employ re-patriatod prisoners for military purposes.(2)   The British Delegates are insisting that repatriated prisoners should not bo employed in foreign territory such as Russia or the East.Germany has declared Russia a non-battle front.   If Germany can employ repatriated-prisoners in Russia she could release an equivalent number of men to fight on the Western: Front.If the British Delegates are unable to. gain this point It would be best to insist on. aL1 conditions being withdrawn or that tho only condition should be that repatriated prisoners could not be employed within 30 kilometres of the line on the &quot;&quot;-ostern Front.British Prisoners could then if required be employed In Palestine Mesopotamia etc. or on the Lines of Communication in France.The British Delegates ask for an e^rly roply on tho two points mentioned above.Prisoners of War Department..
