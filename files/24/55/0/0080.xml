Document is the Property oT m-itannic Majesty&apos;s Government,)y*.I circulate, for the consideration of the V/arCabinet, the following Memorandum which has been pri-pared by tho Board of Trade with reference to the Kote by the General Staff dated the 20th May, on the sub-jeot of a request made by the Greek Government for a Loan of 21 million francs to assist the developmont of the Piraeus-Salonika Railway (G.2.4595).A. H. STAftLLTf.Board of Trade.28th Juno, 1918Memorandum  by   &quot;the   Board   of  Trade.* mm........w ww. -.. . ^wi i i^iLiwWK.....*m * ************ niwinwiiiWiPiwiM i.....-*. . m*mmm*wmmRequest   by   Greok   Government   for   loan   of   21 million   franca   to   assist   the   development   of  the Piraeus - Salonika   railway.The Board of Trade have had under consideration the memorandum by the General Staff (iiO.O.l/163/466) of tho 20th May on the subject of the request made by the Greek Government for a loan of 21 million francs to assist tho development of the Piraeus-Salonika xailwey.The General Staff recommend that Kia Majesty1a Government should participate in the loan chiefly as a means of securing that the whole line from Piraeus to Salonika shall come under the control of the Allied Railway Commission at Sidonika.    This control is deemod of great importance on military grounds and i8 clearly reoonnendod as a war measure.With this aspect of the matter the Bo&amp;rd are not of course concerned.     They however strongly support the 4 suggestion that His Majesty1s Government should partici-pate in the loan, on the ground that it is of groat im-portance to British trading interests that the line should be developed and that this country should secure some share of the control, not only now but permanently of the management of the line, or at any rate of that part of it between Piraeus sad Xaterini.    From this point of view they attach chief importance to securing as a condition of the loan that a British representative shall be added to the &quot;Superior Direction of Transports&quot;, which controls the pxu-ely Greek part of the line, namely, that between Piraeus and Xaterini.    The Direction con-sis ts at present of two Greeks sad one Frenchman under the presidency of M. Venizelos.His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Athens considers that the Greeks will certainly : not consent to the condition sug-gested by the General citaff, namely that the line should be put under the control- of the Allied Railway Comraiusion at Salonika.     Whether it is found possible to secure this condition or not, the Board of Trade trust that it(1)
^ .j dmay, in any case, be made an absolute oonaition of theloan that a British representative should be added to the &quot;Superior Direction of Transports&apos;&quot;.They also consider that tho following further conditions should if possiblo be attached to p&amp;rtiei-p^tion in tho loan ;-(l)   That one British, one French, one American ancl. one Greek be appointsd as practical 07&apos; erks ox the r/orks to control the expendi-tare.(2)   Thet 3 fair, share of any order3 fcr matorials ordered from loon funds be placed in Great Britain, if this country is in a position to execute such orderu.The benefits accruing from the proposed development of the Piraeus-Salonika railway will be not merely ox a temporary and military nature but will continue after the war to the general advantage of trade and conEoerce. The French Government have already signified thoir &apos; willingness to share in the loan, and, as H.M. Minister at Athens points out, if H.H, Government do not also participate, it is probable that the French Crovornment will advance the whole sum themselves.     If this occurrod, Prance would probably obtain full control of this im-por bant line of railway and would as a result acquire a predominant influence in the country..     Such a state of affairs would be detriments! to the future expansion of British come roe and enterprise, in ureece.Orders for large quantities of rolling stock and other material would probably be lost to this country,,and franee, being in control of the railway, might be able to enforce in French interests the adoption of advantageous rates or rebates on merchandise passing over the line from the benefits of which British traders night be excluded.The Piraeus-Salonika railway will no doubt play an important part in the reconstruction and development of Salonika and Macedonia, so that in the general interests of British commerce it is highly desirable that this country should not, through failure to participate in *the loan, be faced with serious disadvantages in this field in the future.BOAR&quot;) OF TRADE.27th June, 1918.
