Fortunately this estimate was exceeded, the realised imports for tho year reaching 35*500,000 tons.   With regard to the present year, it was feared early 1&amp;.1917 when the intensive submarine campaign was at its height that United Kingdom imports in 1918 might fall to 25,000,000 tons, or lower.    This would have spelt something like disaster.   It is now hoped that imports this year will emount to 32,000,000.    Tho position is therefore much less serious than was at one time feared, though the estimated imports for the year are still lower by 3&amp; million tons than In 1917,    The situation is not yet free from anxiety, but, apart from developments of the Military situation which may throw a further strain on , . tonnage the danger point appears to have boon passed.   The parties that have contributed to the improved outlook hart been many and wieua and nay he considered under Tour hoadt:(2) Of this 14  million tons of shipping now under the BritishFlag, less than 7 million tons is available to carry on the essential.importing work of the United Kingdom, including the transport of allfood stuffs, raw materials for munitions of war, etc.   This figure isarrived at as follows.-Total 30th April 1918;..........................say 14,500,000DeductionsImperial Naval &amp; Military Service.say 3,400,000Indian &amp; Dominionsf Service.....500,000Allied Service.......................&quot;   1,700,000Trading permanently abroad (Mostlyin Colonial Waters).........1,150,000Tank Steamers........................&quot;   1,050,000Under repair, and launched hut notcompleted...................700.000    8,500,000
(1)   The improved organisation and employment of British ehipping.(8)   The better employment of neutral shipping.(3)   The developnent of the convoy system and generallythe improved attack upon and defence againstsubmarines and mines. (4)   NeW construction In the United Kingdom and abroad. (4)   THE IMPROVED ORGANISATION AND EMPLOYMENT OF BRITISH SHIPPING.(a) The requisition of British shipping kas been made, for practical purposes, complete.    British shipowners have become in effect agents for the Government, working at a limited rate of profit. All stores required by the Government, either tor the direct purposes of the war or for the major supplies of the population* are carriedsit cost price.In this connection it should be pointed out that the requisitioning ef the liner services with the consequent concentration of tonnage en the short routes has added enormously to the imports oarrled, but it has necessarily broken up old-egtablisfced shipping connections, as, for example, where we have taken British $hips entirely out of the Worth-South American trade, or transferred hhem from the Australasian trade to the Atlantic.(b) In order to neutralise the constant and cumulative diminution1Of tonnage, the employment of all vessels under requisition has been (based upon the principle of fetching every ton of cargo from the nearest j possible source of supply.   This has meant in practice a very heavyConcentration of shipping on the Trans-Atlantic Routei    The trades j between this country and the Par East, Australasia and India I respectively have correspondingly suffered, but it must be borne in I Kind that it is only through the adoption of this policy that the Mercantile Marine has been able to do the work that has been required pf it.   In fact, the continued strain on British tonnage. Increased by [the German offensive in Prance and Italy, makes it essential that every 1 vessel
vessel which can be 3pared from distant waters should be diverted for service within the War Zone.   A large quantity of British shipping isstill engaged in trades away from the United Kingdom and the-co-operation of the Dominion Governments is desired in   keeping the employment of this tonnage under constant scrutiny with a view to tho release of further ships wherever practicable for service in the War Z$ne.(c)   There has been great improvement In the turn-round of vessels although, of course, this factor is always modified by the necessary conditions of securing the highest degree of safety, (d)   As all ships carry full cargoes and as tho proportion of dead-weight cargo under present conditionals very high the Imports.carried are much greater in relation to tonnage entrances than in time of peace.-(e)   The work of tonnage priority has been so far extended and refined that only essential cargoes are brought into the United Kingdom.   This has entailed the modification of many industries, and the re-export trade of the United Kingdom, (i.e. the importation of goods for the purposes of merchant re-export trade), has been for the greater part sacrificed and may never be regained.(5)   THE BETTER EMPLOYMENT OF FOREIGN SHIPPING.During peace time some 30 per cent of United Kingdom imports were brough in foreign ships.   It has been the aim of the German Submarine Campaign not only to destroy the actual neutral ships which serve us, but also to deter neutral owners generally from engaging in any trade of interest to the Allies.   This aim has had to be countered by the use of our control over bunkers and over the essential supplies which the Neutral countries need.   With regard to the Northern European Neutrals, tho measures taken have been so successful that practically the whole of their Mercantile Marine is now, or will shortlyee,
I  &quot;P-T-3, serving the Allies directly or Indirectly, with the exception f that portion which Is required by the Neutral countries themselves o maintain their existence and of a small fraction under the Jhysical control of Germany.Norway,   An Agreement with Norwsy gave the right to requisition r time charter for Allied services all Norwegian vessels not squired for Norway1s essential supplies, subject to Great Britain dertaking to carry in British tonnage the coal required by Norway, his agreement has given control over about 1,000,000 tons gross of jlorwegian tonnage.Denmark.   An agreement with Denmark accorded us the right to ipprove all voyages of Danish tonnage in return for undertaking on iur part to permit the export of coal from the United Kingdom to lenmark in Danish ships.   About 400,000 tons gross of Danish tonnage &amp; npw employed In Allied service.Sweden.   An agreement with Sweden secures for Allied service n time charter about 250?000 tons gross of Swedish tonnage, of which fne-half is available for War Zone trading.   A further 100,000 tons f Swedish tonnage is to be employed in Swedish Overseas Lines, which argely serve the United States and the British Empire.Holland.   German pressure on Holland prevented the conclusion of In agreement with that oountry, but the action of the United States md Great Britain in requisitioning the Dutch tonnage in Allied ports lias secured for Allied service nearly 500,000 tons gross of Dutch tonnage.Greece.   The total amount of Greek tonnage over 1,000 tons gross is just over 200,000 tons gross; of this about 56,000 tons is employed in the service of Greece herself, the remainder being used n the same way as Neutral tonnage, that is to say, mainly in the fervice of Prance and Italy.
(6)     THE IMPROVED ATTACK UPON, AND DEFENCE AQaINST SUBMARINES AND MINESThe Admiralty has so far succeeded in combating submarines and mines that the British rate   of loss, which rose in April. 1917 to the enormous figure of 548,000 tons, fell in the three months ending May 1918 to an average-of 191,000 tons.   In this connection the Ministry of Shipping has worked hand in hand with the Admiralty in arranging.the details of the convoy system which has played so I large, if not a determining, part in the improvement which has been effected,   The ocean convoy system was not started until June 1917, Prom that date down to June 15th 1918 the results of the homeward bound ocean convoys have been as fellows:.   Number of Convoys 385Number of Ships 5,555Gross Tonnage 29,094,251Percentage of Tonnage Lost 1.35Summing the results of the better use of British shipping we get the following striking facts:-The net loss of British vessels of 1,600 tons gross and upwards in the year 1917 was about 600.   Making due allowance for the date at which the losses in 1917 occurred, the British tonnage available in 1917 was 20 per cent less than in 1916.   Yet the fall in cargo imported into the United Kingdom in British vessels in 1917, as compared with 1916, was only about 2 per cent. (7)      NEW CONSTRUCTION IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND ABROAD.The policy of constructing Standard Ships, which was initiated by the Ministry of Shipping within a few days of its establishment in December 1916, is beginning to bear fruit,and there is little doubt that in the near future a higher rate of output will be attained.   In May 1918 new construction reached 197,000 tons as against a loss from enemy attack in the same month of 173,000 tons.American
American construction has risen to about the British standard and bids fair to make further increase.   Per some time to come, however, America , will need all her new ships for the supply of the American Army and for other material needs and she is at the present time still making heavy demandB on British tonnage, (8) As regards the future, if the rate of sinking owing toenemy action does not seriously increase, and if present expectations es to new construction in this country and in the United States are realised, a state of equilibrium haB now been reached in which all losses are balanced by new construction.     Although, therefore, It may be hoped that progressive decline in the carrying capacity of the World&apos;s Mercantile Marine has now come to en end, it must be borne in mind that -(i) The large expansion of the American MilitaryProgramme has involved an additional and heavy strain on British tonnage as America has comparatively few vessels of the trooping type.(ii) The requirements for the supply of the AmericanArmies will, it Is anticipated by the American Government, absorb the entire output of the American ship yards this year, as well as all the ships which America can spare from her own importing work.   This means that the substantial tonnage assistance which it was hoped America might be able to afford to Prance and Italy will not, be provided.(iii) The recent German offensive in the North hasseriously interrupted the transport of coal from the mines in the Pas de Calais to the districts further South, and the loss to Prance can only be made up by increased shipments from this country, and a correspondingly Increased use of British tonnage.   The extra requirements of Italy are being met to some extent by the import-ation of French coal by rail so as to save sea transport and avoid war risk, but every ton of coal which is so exported from Prance has to be replaced by compensating coal shipped from the United Kingdom to Prance.
j 1028.(9) The establishment of the. Allied Maritime Transport Councilhas enabled a comprehensive review to be made of the relation between the import requirements of the Allies as a whole and of the tonnage available.   The result of the investigations made by the permanent organisation of the Council indicates1that on the present import programmes of Prance, Italy and Great Britain for the year 1918 there will be a deficit of about     million tons.   The import programmes of the Allies are under constant sorutiny, and it is hoped may be considerably reduced, but the necessity for the exercise of the most rigid economy cannot be exaggerated.21st June 1918,*
