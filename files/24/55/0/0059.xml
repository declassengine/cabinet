Some Notes on American ?.

Nominally, the labour situation in the United States is satisfactory. There are few or no serious disputes.    The Administration has set up a good deal of new machinery to with the supply and regulation of labour. The National War Labour Board - a joint body of employers and labour representatives under the chairmanship of ex-President Taft and Mr. Walsh, a St. Louis Lawyer closely identified with the championship of labour interests - has been made a permanent organ of the Administration for purposes of arbitration and consiliation, after issuing an agreed statement of principles as a basis for a war labour programme. More recently, another and more official body has been set up under the chairmanship of Mr. Frank-furter, until recently a Professor of Law at harvard who has for some time been prominent in the discussion of labour problems. The purpose of this new Board seems to be to coordinate tho labour policy of the various Departments and Bureaux at Washington.

It is on the basis of these efforts and on the close consultation established between Mr. Gompers and the -Administration that the Secretary of Labour recently stated in an address before the American Academy of Political and Social Science that "we have fewer labour strikes at the present time than at any other period within my recollection, notwithstanding the fact that it is the period of the year when stri?s  are usually most numerous.  There is not a solitary stri?e in the coal industry, the packing-house industry, in the oil industry, the lumbering industry, the shipbuilding industry, in the steel production, transportation, telegraph or telephone systems of the country, and only a few strikes of minor importance in the textile industry, metal trades, munitions factories and all other production enterprises."
As against this, the President of the &quot;National Pounders&apos; Association&quot; - a very conservative union of employers - has stated that &quot;since the declaration of this truce (the statement of the &apos;7ar labour&quot; Board) there have been many strikes.   Thus far, only the power of public opinion has *reventfcd them from spreading.&quot;A sane estimate of the situation is summed up in thefollowing remark made in a private letter by an official oftho War Department in close touch with the labour problems ofthat Department&quot;The general labour situation here is reasonably good on the surface.    Nothing particularly serious is on the dockot of unsettled controversies.    But the underlying situation causes mo considerable concern.&quot;As a matter of fact, the statement of principles issued by the National War Labour Board, though marking a considerable advance over anything that American employers as a whole have been willing to agree to in the past, con-tains nothing very new or far-reaching.    It requires some knowledge of the very backward state of American opinion to appreciate the advance involved in such provisions as that &quot;the right of workers to organise in trade unions and to bargain collectively, through chosen representatives, is recordsed and affirmed.&quot;    Some of the concessions to labour demands made in this statement are marked by vrhat Lr. ?ooso-velt used to call ^ecsel phrases&apos;.    For instance&quot;The basic cisht-hour dty is recognised as applying in ell cases in which exisUngr,law requires it.    In all other cases ine ouo&quot;sTion of hours of labor shall be settled rith due rop-trd to governmental necessities and the relfare, health and proper comfort of the workers.&quot;Lr. Frankfurter^ roard is a much more serious and useful body, but its functions and authority are undefined iud the statement issuod by the Chairman a month ago on taking up his *;ork is a damnin- description of the existing disorganisation:-
&quot;Since the outbreak of the war tho Jtoited States government has o&amp;ae to bo tho greatest single em-plover of l&amp;bour In the country. -%ut it to had no operating policy with regard to the tfJUraia ao a waola.   3aoh one has boon operated individually as n separate enterprise, quite apart from the others, end, so far as the. lebor supply has . been concerned, in actual cfcupeti^flQ with the others..*The labor teaovor, the Xoao of motion and of producticii taoeuoe of this condition of affairs, has been notoriously wasteful.   The inducement has been created all eve? the country for men working in one industry to change their jobs and $0 where more money was obtainable - as a matter of fact., where it was offered to entice thea away.&quot;The best opinion in the United States is that there is no actual labour shortage in the country, and it is the disorganisation here described which has hampered war production.There is little sign in the papers published by thevarious labour unions of any deorease in the hostility betweenlabour and some of the big corporations whose labour policyhas always been a source of friction and discontent.    In thesUtfl industry, Lr. Schwab - who has been appointed Controlleror Shipbuilding - has had a serious strike in the BethlehemSteel tforks, over the excessive length of shifts for whichthoso lorks have lon* been notorious.    Tho United StatesSteel Corporation is accused by labour of extending to itsnew T)kHts the conditions which have Ion? been the cause ofcomplaint tt Gary and elsowHro.-    The Lcttl Trades associationis accused in tho &quot;International Lolclors Journal&quot; of adeliberate policy of excluding union labour, as evidenced bytbe following pledge exacted from workmen by a manufacturingfirm in Illinois&quot;I promise that, during the time I am in their omplou, that I will faithfully and diligently servo thorn to the best of my ability and, that I will not mike any derand upon them for aa increase in *u^es, nor participate in any strike, nor unite with other employes in any concerted action with a view to socurin^ greater compensation.&quot;Tho Telegraph Companies have got intp conflict with the National War Labour Board for dismissing union employes. Tho situation&apos; on ttto pacific Voast apparently continues veryunsatisfactory.
The Mooney case is still unsettled and supplies a common ground for agitation to the American Federation of Labour and to the I.W.W. - to the  SanFrancisco "Labour Clarion" and to the Seattle "Daily Call".

An instance of the kind of th? which stimulates friction between labour and employers is furnished by a recent report of the National Industrial Conference Board, a body formed by the leading employers&apos; trade associations to study labour problems. The Board is unfortunately a very conservative not to say reactionary body, and this particular report deals with the effect of reduction of hours of labour on output in a very unsatisfactory and unscientific manner. It has been violently attacked by students of labour problems like Robert Brudre.

Some indication of the kind of state of mind of organised labour is furnished by the fact that one union paper, "The Railway Clerk", quotes the following passage from President Wilson&apos;s "New Freedom - a collection of his speeches in 1912 - as foreshadowing the war Ã  l&apos;outrance against organised labour which will follow the conclusion of peace:-

"Don&apos;t deceive yourselves for a moment as to the power of the great interests which now dominate our development. They are so great that it is almost an open question whether the Government of the United States can dominate them or not. Go one step further, make their organised power permanent, and it may be too late to tum back. The roads diverge at the point where we stand."

No doubt it would be foolish to take too seriously disputes and controversi? ? characteristic of American conditions for many years past. We may be fairly sure that
that President Iil80a!s.&apos;p&apos;iPestlgo wi 11 prevent any serious -V d&amp;nfliot oemirig to a head &amp;o long as the war lasts.   But -: it is well to remamber that the United States Government . admittedly has enormous difficultly to cope with in did-. tributlng and supplying labour for its immense pKgrammeo of war;production, and that in dealing with sueh endemic weaknesses as the excessive labour turnover in essentialia Indus tries, success cannot be hoped for until mutual distrust between employers and labour in such industries la eliminated to a much greater degree than at present. It li On the relations between employers and labour in individual industriess indeed, that any increase in organ ieation or efficiency must be b&amp;sed, for the Government has taken no far-reaching powers et control over eaployeh and its relation to labour must therefore remain largely oonfined to the function of &quot;honest broker&quot;.   In these oiroumstanoes, labour will deubtless come more and more to press for an extension of Government control.   The ^ministration will stimulate this tendency by concessions tp the great itfdy of labour which It does now directly control - i.e. the failroad employees for whom a government commission has recently recommended a very large increaso of wages.   The indirect ^honest broker&quot; control of the eotlsiing Boards will pmo mor$ and more inade^te /even when&quot; reinforced by the iSmirdstratioVs efforts te reserve rights.of arbitration to itself in war industries by clauses inserted in its contracts, with &amp;aploye?s.   The end cannot be foreseen, but the tendency iu evident.^Tht
The ctbovo notes deal eoiely-wirtlrth^-etfl^ &quot;^Ung^wlthin t^iinwric^ of labour and thoRailroad Brotherhoods.   Mie indepeiulenVlabou^ ations oan really be much more easily dealt with by the Administration since, thotign thoy are more radical in their outlook, they respond j&amp;uoh more quickly to individual fair treatment.   Even the anarbkio situation in the lumber-o^mps in the Horth-Wedtt due to i.W.W. agitation, has ironed itself-out to comparative smoothness under the personalJtafluenoe of Colonel Disque of tho War-IKjpartment-who has taken charge of lumber production in that region.   The worst that has got to be feared from the independent organisations is sporadic strikes like the one recently settled in tho g&amp;raetit trade at St. Louis.   Such sporadic disturbances may break out if Mooney is $ touted or if the present trial of the I.W.W. at Chicago results in severe sentences on the I.W.W. leaders * but these disturbances, though perhaps attended by serious looal oonsequences, as is indieated by the so-called &quot;Sabotage Bill&quot; recently passed by Congress, will hardly be protracted or widespread.A few words must be said about the international aspect of the American labour movement in its relation to the war.   The American Labour Mission whioh has recently been in this country reported to the annual Convention of the American Federation of Labour which met at St. Paul on June 10th - simultaneously with a Convention of the American Alliance for Labour and Democracy, an association formedfor
for patriotic objects last year to combat the pacifism of bodies like the Non-Partisan League and the Peoples&apos; Council.   The Mission&apos;s report reiterated the opposition of &quot;American Labour51 to any inter-bellii^ereht conference, but it seems to have emphasised the need for the establish-metit o&amp;, an&quot;international federation of labour end to have recommended $he maintenance abroad of one or more represent-atives of the Federation for the period of the war.It may be conjectured that this is intended as a bridge for the establishment &quot;o %a better understanding on war problems and war policy.   The American Federation of Labour is under considerable pressure toJBStabiish a better understanding for it cannot ignore ths^peated attacks upon Mr. Gompers1 international policy made by; liberal intellectual opinion in the United States.   TheseAattacks were renewed on the return of the American Mission &quot;by*.a leading American jourtial-ist also just returned from England in an article alleging that the refusal of the American Mission to disouss inter-natibnal policy with an open mind had produced a deplorable impression upon the British Labour Party.The real difficulty of the situation, which it is iperhaps important to recognise in advance, ie that the diver-genoe of views between the American Federation of Labour and the British Labour Party goes much deeper than any incidental discussion of international labour diplomacy at thia moment. A comparison between the comments on the reconstruction ptffe-gramme of the British Labour Party made by A. F.of Ii. journals on the one hand, and by journals of independent unions and organs of intellectual liberal opinion on theother,
($ther, shows that the real divergence is between two quitedifferent stages of development in the labour movement.tov instance, the San Francisco &quot;Labour Clarion&quot;, which isthe official organ of the San Franoisoo Labour Council andof the California State Federation of Labour, comments onthe British labour programme is follows:-&quot;The platform Of the British Labor Party deems to be mainly concerned with removing competition between men and thus making life easier xor all of us.   Whether life would he made easier if coin-petition were removed and tho necessity to hustle  , to maintain ourselves wiped out, we have very serious doubt.&quot;Mr. Oompers, in the &quot;American Federationist&quot;comments as follows:-wBut the first striking contrast cf fundamental importance is that the British proposal deals with Labor&apos;s achievements in the future wholly in poli-tioal terms. The problems are formulated as political issues and the agency designated is the political party. The heart of the American labor movement is economic: labor&apos;s welfare and prctec-tion is regarded as fundamentally an economic pro-blea to be&apos;dealt with by econcmio agenoies...............&quot;So the American reader finishes the doou-ment entitled &quot;Labor and the Hew Social Order&quot; with a feeling of exultation stirred by the hope of what the futuro may bring, but when he turns to concrete problems that must be worked out to-day and to-morrow and through each day that follows, he finds little practical help for real achievements.    In the future, as in the past, we must trust in the economic organ-isation of the workers.&quot;We have here hardly anything which represents a labour point of view in the Europe em sense.   Both comments fi&amp;ght almost have been written by an American employer or by an American politician of the old school, and, when Mr. Oompers adds that &quot;the democracy of the American labor movement is of the same nature as that of cur Republic. It is more hearty, more sincere, and more far-^&amp;hirg than the democracy of
a.ony of any-other country&quot; * one almost feels oneself backin the pages Of ^Martin Chtealewit&quot;.If there was no dther labour view in the tJnitedStates, suoh an attitude might not fcive^rise to seriousdifficulty.    If the British Labour Party had no sympath-isers in the United States, communications between Britishend Jtoerioon labour might be unfruitful but would not haveany disturbing effect on the situation in the United Statesor on the relations between British and American opinion.But, as a matter of fact, that Party has very strong sym-pathisers in the United States, and those sympathisers areto be found among the people who are most bitterly opposedte Compere and to almost everything for which he stands.For instanoe, the &quot;Advance11, the off jcial organ of theAmalgamated Clothing Workers of AsKflftoaWrites as follows&quot;Among the labor movements of the world the British labour movements hod been considered as the most conservative and even reactionary, particularly so as compared with the high revolu-tionary standard set up by the German labor move-ment.   But while the German labor movement suffered complete moral shipwreck the moment the war storm broke out, the British labor movement in that very storm developed such a powerful revolutionary spirit and such wonderful vitality that it is now the guiding star of the working classes of the world and the hope of all true democratic forces.&quot;Liberal intellectual opinion follows suit.   Awriter in the &quot;New York Nation&quot; goes as far as to say that:-&quot;The historical significance of this dooument (i.e. the British reconstruction programme) appears to be that it presages a new stage in the develop-ment of the democratic ideal.    Perhaps it is the beginning of the long-delayed economic dequel of the achievement of the French Revolution, in whioh oase it may very v/eli tea out to be the Magna Carta of the new democracy.&quot;In
In such a situation tho presence of delegates of the Jtaerioan Fed^attoa of Labour in Sfctgland seems a step in th;e right direction.   Representatives of the British Labour Party, when they visit the United States, are always in on   , uncomfortable position.   Tho futm of the American labour movement must, after all, lid in ail evolution o&amp; revolution. :&quot;\ within the ranks of the Amerioan Federation of Labour.   That will surely happen on the death of Mr. Gompers ,. if not befbrb. The war must inevitably have its effect in radicalising labour3 in America as elsewhere.   The independent oganisations are not strong enough.   Their traditions are in many oases those-of Continental Socialism.   Those traditions have been slightly dimmed by the vague atmosphere of the United States, but&apos; on the whole they are more akin to the Continental Socialist movement than to British labour, and they will not flourish naturally in the soil of America.   Consequently, if a closer understanding between those large and important parts of; the population of Great Britain and the United States which- are * included in the labour movements of the two countries has anything to oon tribute towards the general rapprochement between the two peoples, the presence of delegates of the A. F. of L* in England will provide a much better bridge farsuch anunderstanding than;the presence of British labour represent^...... &quot;&apos; *&apos;atives in the United States, caught, as such representatives must always be, between an unsyrapathatic Federation of Labour&quot; on whose cooperation they have in the long run to re3^, and -sympathetic socialist organisations and liberal coteries which in the long run cannot aspire to represent the solid central sentiment and development of American labour. -P. S.  SinoOf.&apos;
L U 0P,8. Since tho above was written a cable has been^published in tho English pms earaounoing the in&amp;sntion of the American Alliance f cr Labour and Democracy to send an American figsiaiiii delegation to confer with British labour^ under the leadership of Mr. Sparge.   Mi*o Sparge represents the pro*war group which seceded from the Socialist party a year ago.    His views on international.policy will differ in nfc tSEontial respect from those enunciated here by Mr. Gompera&apos; delegates, but he may bo expected to exhibit more intelligence in discussion then theyrpp^ar to have shewn.
