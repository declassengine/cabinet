Organisation, equipment and training in Canada now are regarded as.subsidiary to early embarkation.The general policy of Canada has been to be content with a comparatively small munbee of formations,- but to strive to keep -th*se up to the i r e s t ab 11 shia eno s *Up to the present this has been carried out with succeas as regards the Fighting Echelon.    Owing to the transition from volun-tary recruiting to compalsory service, there has been a strain upon the Second or Training Bohelon;   the progress made in the new system of recruitment in Canada has been such that it is hoped that this strain soon will be eased.THE FIRST ECHELONThe Fighting Echelon in France comprised the following on April 30th 1918.:-&apos;Troops actually engaged in fighting 100,757Troops not actively engaged in fighting&apos; Railway, Forestry, L. of C, sick in hospitals etc, 45,021Reinforcements 13,368&apos;159.260&quot;*

A Tank Battalion has &quot;been formed.     Nervine in this is voluntary and a high olass of recruits has been procured.Until lately Canada: maintained on the prairies the Royal Northwest Mounted Police,...an effective mounted constabulary foree, which in May-1918 numbered, about 900 all ranks. Practically the whole,of this&apos;forco is beinf? sent over as a cavalry draft, numbering 725*A certain proportion of tho recent voluntary enlistment may &quot;be regarded as. due to the operations of the Military Service Act.     Some of the enlistments of Canadians and other British subjects in the United States, while technically voluntary, have been made under pressure.     Certain&apos;subsidiary forces are maintained(a) A number of the Permanent Force and certain units bf Militia which:are embodied for garrison and other purposes in Canada.     These on 30th April 19l8 numbered 12j R9I.(b) A snail garrison is maintained in St. Lucia,West Indies.     Oh 31st May this numbered 289.The embodied Militia provide garrisons for Halifax, Esquimalt, Sydney Harbour, St. John (Fova Scotia), Quebec, and Montreal, and guards for cable and wireless stations, canals, internment camps, etc^       Instructional staffs of considerable size are necessary.

The transition from voluntary enlistment ,to compulsory service was attended by sundry, difficulties and in Canada the winter nm$3a.tfibjadvantageousfor training.     When the summer,comps are opened facilities will exist for dealing with considerable numbers of recruits and more will be called to the colours.     The present expectation Is that it will be possible to despatch between 80,000 and. 90,000 young men before the winter of I9I8-I9.     In addition a certain number of Voluntary recruits may be expected; during the past winter the number of these ranged from 4,000 to 6,000 a month;   this includes men procured in the United States of America.For receiving, equipping, training and despatching those recruits there exists certain depots and camps.     The depots are :-Infantry :	16	Cavalry        3Artillery . t Machine gut	18	Engineers     1	1   1	&quot; A.S.C.         3A.M. C.	9	Forestry &amp; Rly. .Constr.l
All&apos; tfte.se- de-pots will go- under 1 canvas, as soon as the weather permits; they will -th;en have ample space for organisation and training.   The artillery depots have concentrated at the large practice camp at petawawa.., The principle-upon which these depots are formed is that of territorial organisation;&apos; this is most pronounced in the case of-the infantry.;  The, Canadian Infantry (to take it as the example) is divided.into twelve territorial regiments.   Each of these has one or two depot battalions&apos; in.Canada; each; has one, two-, or three reserve battalions in England, and each has /several fighting battalions in Prance distributed among, the/several Brigades and Divisions.Under the present system a recruit normally spends the whole &apos; of his military career in the ^ne regiment, passing from one battalion&apos; to another.   This policy is the result of comparatively recent re-organisation.. Earlier in the war the method of recruiting followed was to raise numerous u flit a, retaining each in Canada until it was more or less up to establishment, and had. received a good deal of training.   Of infantry alone more than&apos;250^battalions were authorised.   This method created undesirably lar-^e numbers of senior officers, and was disadvantageous for training inasmuch as when a battalion proceeded overseas (sometimes after&apos;remaining for a year in Canada), some of the men, having enlisted as soon as it was authorised, had been kept unduly long at elementary training and oome, having enlisted just before embarkation, were quite untrained. Further; four fifths of these battalions had to be turned into reserve units, or broken up for drafts, and there was a waste of regimental loyalties. &quot;TRAINING METHODS,The - foregoing, being the general principle of recruitment, it &apos;.. is necessary now to touch upon training methods.   These-at present are. in a phase which may not necessarily endure.   During 1917, and especially during the latter months of that year, the stream of enlistment slackened, and as a result&apos; the Depots in England were depleted.   Even now the reinforcements in England are fewer than the general situation demands.   Accordingly&apos;,&apos; for .some time, the authorities in Canada have been directing their effprte to sending recruits across in as large numbers, as. possible,   The governing conditions.have.-been, the supply;- of tonnage and the supply of men. This situation has meant that recruits have been despatched as soon after embodiment as possibjla.   This phase will last for some time* but when the reserve and training formations in England are filled, may be modified.Training methods are substantially identical on. both sides of the Atlantic; Canada naturally lays weight on the more elementary portions ,o&apos;f, ,&apos;a ..g.ol-dier&apos;s training, and aims at sending across men^ho &amp;ft?ciiie3W&apos;give:n -a- solid foundation upon which to base the numerous accomplishments heeded by the&apos; soldier cf to-day..&apos; The training/ syllabus in use in the United-. Kingdom (which prescribes 14 weeks for the infantry soldier) is used in Canada and in England..   Each recruit numbers among his documents a training sheet,,/on which is entered the completion of each item&apos;in the -training.   He thus takes to  England an exact record of his pro-gresly-&apos; and the authorities there are&apos; able to continue h-fca training from the point where it has been interrupted by his voyage.On joining&apos; his depot. .the reeruiVis clothe^.,; equipped, inoculated,..&apos;&apos; and undergoes the usual preliminaries&apos;:.   He then is .. given close-order drill, careful--physical trainings-musketry       , and bayonet-fighting, and, in general, the work of the earlier weeks of the syllabus..,, care being&apos;taken,as&apos; already .noted,. - to make this preliminary training&quot;as.-.-sound &apos;and&apos;thoroUgli as possible,. The completion- of each week-.; of. the. syllabus is entered on&apos;hi a &apos; training .sheet-.  ..At -present, owing to conditions-which already
have TSnsrerr^sacp^^ ero-l-diors ummlly leave--comparative-ly early in their training; engineers, signallers, A,S,C&quot;, men, etc., for whom there is not such immediate need, remain in Canada longer and carry their training to a more advanced point. Once the needs of the cadres in England are served, infantry training may be carried further in Canada,   Certain advantages in postponing their departure, such as the increased demand on food supplies in England, are obvious.   On. the other hand, there are certain advantageo in giving a considerable proportion of the training in England? among these are:- -(a) Training takes places in closer proximity to the fighting, and can be modified more quickly as opinions and methods change in the field,(b) The authorities in England are responsible for feeding the Advanced -Base with reinforcements, and it is advantageous for them to have as many of the recruits as possible under their hand, to lengthen or shorten their training as opportunity or necessity dictates*(e)   It is advantageous from a disciplinary point of view to move the recruits away from home influences and into an area close /to the scene of action.   There is perhaps a greater feeling of reality among the men when a voyage has been made, and the theatre of war is near.The foregoing particulars relate to the administration of the Canadian Expeditionary Force,   Men have been provided, in smaller numbers, for ether services, and through other channels. Among these are:-.   (a)-  The Royal klv Force,(b)   Contingents of Poles, Serbians, Montenegrins, etc, ;   (o)   Inland waterways and docks.The Royal Air Force with the approval and aid of the Government of Canada, has conducted considerable operations in recruiting and training personnel, &apos; Before the establishment of the Royal Air Force the Department of the Naval Service   entered 580 men for the Royal Naval Air Service; the losses among these have been 72 deaths and 97 other casualties.   As regards the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Air Force, up to 10th May tho figures were:-  -Pilots cent overseas 1,387Pilots trained in Canada and retained as instructors 214Pilots in training 3,301Mechanics&apos;serving In Canada Enlisted in CanadaEnglish personnel      570      5,705        10,605Under a reciprocal scheme with the. United States, t&amp;e following United States Cadets and personnel were trained by the R, *F, in Canada and Texas:*U.S. Army Pilots 456U.S,     &quot;   Officers trained in aerialAdjutant and Equipment officers 25 Rank and file in aerial gunnery 40 Naval Pilots - 23Observers 80gunnery - 44.U.S,u,s.U.S. U.S.tttt
The Royal Air Force Is an Imperial Service.   The Canadian Government has aided Its recruiting department in the following respects:-(a) By granting the use of sundry camping grounds rifle   ranges, etc. for training purposes.(b) By placing at its disposal the whole of the Canadian recruiting organization.(c) By giving complete facilities and authority to enlist Cadets under the Miliatry Service Act.In addition to the formal governmental assistance mentioned in the foregoing paragraph, the following organiza-tiona have rendered assistance to the Recruiting Department:-The National Service Board:   By circulating on its behalf&quot;&quot; &apos;   men registered for National Service.The Canadian Patriotic Fund:   By making grants to the wives or dependents of danadians who joined the Royal Air Force.The Aero Club of Canada:   By placing the Recruiting EJiaff in touch with various public men throughout the country.Individuals also have assisted.    Civilian recruiting committees, composed of men active in public and business life, exist in 232 tcwus.   Ten machines have been presented to the Royal Air Force by private munificence.As regards Poles, on 23rd April there had been despatched overseas 8,400, and 1,606 were In Canada.    These troops have been provided for the French service.As regards Montenegrins, the movement of these came to an end in 1915j in all 2,457 men were despatched to Gibraltar, and from thence to their final destination in the Mediterranear theatre of war.As regards Serbians, the total number sent forward has been 3,185.    These men have been sent to their national army.As regards Inland Waterways and Docks, on 3rd May 1918 the figures were:-Sent overseas       2,595Remaining inNorth America 527Total 2,922.Most of the administration work in connection with the forwarding of these troops, between 18,000 and 19,000 in number has been done by Canada.The movement of Chinese Labour Corps had been largely across Canada.    Up to 9th May, approximately 95,000 of these have been sent forward across the Atlantic    The administrative work connected with the die embarkation on the Pacific Coast, the railway journey across Canada and the embarkation at Halifax has been done by the Quartermaster General.

THE SUPPLY Off MEN.The Military Service Act is the measure designed to produce recruits by compulsory enrolment, y The first class called out by Proclamation in October last Consists of unmarried men and widowers without children between the ages of 20 and 34 inclusive.   Under the Act a system of local tribunals to consider exemptions wag established.   The members of the class who desired to claim exemption were required to appear before these tribunals while those who did not claim exemption, were to report immediately.   A comparatively small number of men reported, the claims for exemption being unexpectedly numerous.   The decisions of the local tribunals were very uneven and resulted in a great number of appeals, the disposition of which necessarily delayed the securing of men.   The opening of the German offensive in March 1918 made it&apos; appear necessary to adopt measures to hasten the immediate securing of men, and it was decided to cancel at once all exemptions granted to men between the ages of 20 &amp;o 22 inclusive leaving the selective machinery to operate in the other ages.   Provision has been made for the cancellation of exemptions in other ages, if necessary but it is hoped that this power will not require to be exercised, as the selective process should furnish the men The Military Service Act only authorises the enlistment of reinforcements to the extent of 100.000 men; if, when that number has been attained, there still is need of men, the-necessary extension will be given to its powers.As a result of the process described, rather more than one-third of tht registration, or about 146,000 men, either have become recruits, or may be regarded as possible recruits Approximate figures by classes are:-Men enrolled to date 43,000Men ordentdto report, time notexpired      10,000 Men ordered to report at once(20 to 23) 37,000Men likely to join as the resultof pending appeals 10,000Men from wre-combing* process(examination of exemptions)        40,000 Defaulters unapprehended -6,000Total 146,000
