^IS DOOuMMNT 13 W iROihRTY 0$ HIS BRIT.-HUIO ^JOaSgYjS GOVERN! jM )*ORE (P.U1BERIAJ, V/AR CABINET, ., g 4948 (a). *No,to off Conversation between Mr, Philip ICofr and 11. Kfrrensky, on June. 2oth&apos;,(Giroiilatod in continuation off Note of interview between tho Prime Minister and Li. Kerensky, G.T.4948).K, Korensky was very anxious that tho Government should understand the relations between the Bolsheviks and the workmen in Russia at the present time.   The Soviets wore originally elected by factory operatives after the Revolution. According to their constitution the electors had the right to recall the representatives and to have periodical elections. Since the Bolshevik Revolution off November 8th, 1917, elections have boon inoperative. Nearly everywhere in Russia workmen held elections and now members were chosen who were not Bolshevikso   Thc^o, however, were never allowed to take their scatss   This, for instance, has boon tho position in petrograd for several months.   The true representative of the opinion of the Potrograd workman is the Conference of V/orkmen and not the Soviet,   Similarly two and a half months ago there was a general election in Moscow at uhich tho majority elected was Bolshevik.   The majority of those eloctod in Petrograd recently is anti-Bolshevik,I asked M, horensky what was tho programme of the Conference of Workmen to which ho alluded in his interview with the I rime Minister,   Ho replied that they stood for tho re-establishment off the Constituent Assembly as the legitimate organ of national opinion.   They were socialists and democrats but in favour of constitutional and national institutions. Thoy wore.against the dictatorship of tho proletariat upon which the Bolshevik regime was basod and wore in favour of national union freedom off the Press and freedom Off speooh which the Bolsheviks had suppressed,   This new labour movement was also definitely against the Brest-Litovsk treaty.   1.1, ICerensky said that this new movement was not founded on sentiment but upon a realisation of the practical facts of tho situation.   The Bolsheviks had promised the workers a new heaven and a new earth.   Tho workers had now realised that the Bolsheviks couia not fulfil their ideal promises and thoy wero worse off now than they had been before because the industries wore closed down and there was no   work to bo got.   They had begun to realise that facts could not bo altered by decrees and that real changes wore ncoessary if their conditions wore to be betterod.The Bolsheviks represent the autocratic principle;in an inverted form,   Tfcyy will permit no opposition to themselves. In a great many of the towns the local Soviets had been dis-persod &quot;by tho Bolsheviks because they would not support the Bolshevik policy.   The most characteristic thing about the Bolshevik movement is that those who conduct it are absolutely unknown in Russia.   Apart from Lenin and Trotsky and one or two others tho names of the leaders arc absolutely unknown. They have no connection with Russia.   They are mostly foreigners -Georgians, Armenians and Jews.   Nobody who was a responsible Russian and had any feeling for Russia could possibly have pursued the policy of the Bolsheviks,   There was no doubt that a certain number of tho loaders in the movement were German agents.
I asked him how it was that tho Bolsheviks got into power. He replied that it toad.&quot;bean essentially a ooup d&apos;etat among the soldiers.   The Bolshevik movement derived its strength from the ten million tired soldiers, who were determined to end the war and got back to the land.   It was these soldiers who were their real support.   The soldiers, however, are now being re-absorbed in the masses of the population and are disappearing. As they are re-absorbed the Bolshevik power is waning.M. Kerensky was anxious that&apos; people in England should realise the extraordinary difficulty of the problem which confronted the Provisional Government.   The Revolution had broken the old bonds^ of unity.   The old order was,in dissolution.   The whole energies of ths Provisional Government were directed towards trying to keep Jktuseia and Russian society United.   Their chief difficulty, was the extremist Bolshevik agitationj whose watoh cries in substance were? &quot;Kill whom you like; steal what- you want; do whatever you desire. It is your right&quot;.   This war cry made a tremendous appeal to the masses, exhausted by war and just liberated from the restraints of the autocratio regime.   In contending with the forces of anarchy the Provisional Government were in a position of extreme difficulty.   In the first throe days after the Revolution of Haroh 1917 the police, the army and the law courts were annihilate^. The whole mechanism of compulsion waB thus suddenly destroyed. The Provisional Government had to set to work to create a new order and the only power which they had to exerolOe wae that of moral infihienoe.   It was often said that the Provisional Government lacked decision and was unwilling to use force in dealing with   -riots and&apos; so forth.   The fact was, it was,not that the Government did not want to deal firmly with, anarchy, but that it had no machinery with which it could deal with it by physical foroe. In the case of the army, it was only by June that the now organisation was. sufficiently advanced to make it possible to oope with riots at the front by the use of force.   Even then immense obstacles were placed in the way because many of the military orzanders and bureaucrats could not understand ther*le$i of de*iLdftg(&apos;*&amp;tftr-a revolutionary army and attempted use thw old methods under the new conditions with failure aethe inevitable result.:,Corresponding with the movement away from the Bolsheviks among the workmen is a.Germanophile movement among the middle and commercial classes,   Before the Bolshevik regime there.wae not Germanophile movement among the middle classes.   On the     , contrary the upper circles of the bourgeoisie headed the,movement against Germany.   U* Kerehsky said that this Germanophile movement was due to two causes.   In the first place, to. a feeling of desperation at the existing order which drove many to the conolusion that the only hope for a tolerable existence for the individual or of recovering any kind of unity for Russia was by . coming to terms with the Germans.   In the second place, to doubts and misgivings as to the attitude of the Allies towards Russia. Nobody in Russia knows what the policy of the Allies towards ;.Russia is.   There were very large sections of opinions in Russia which were violently hostile to the; Bolsheviks for having agreed to the partition of Russia in the Breat*Litovsk treaty and they could not understand why the Allies had seemed to take that treaty so calmly,   A telegram of sympathy with the Russian people which President Wilson had sent to the Moscow Soviet Congress at the very time when this bitter peace was being negotiated came   as a bomb Bhell to all the best elements in Russia.   M. Kerensky was anxious te make it clear that the Germanophile tendencies among the middle classes were not the same as those among the reactionaries.   The latter
m 171- 3 whad always &quot;been Gormanophilu by conviction, the former were becoming Germanophilo simply because of the conditions in Russia and the indacioion of the Allies.   It would be possible to change their sentiments by the right course of action. M. Kerensky also -commented on the statement made by Commander &apos;//edgewood in the House of Commons&apos; yesterday to the effect that the only anti-German forces in Siberia were the Bolsheviks. He said-that if anybody got up and made such a statement in Russia at &quot;the present moment he would be regarded as a lunatic.I asked M. Kerensky whether he did not think that an ill-judged measure of intervention by the Allies might not make the Russian situation worse.    Germany was on the borders of hussia and in fact had her agents and in some measure her armies all&apos;over Lusoia.    ihatevor the Allies did &apos;iGermany would havo plenty of time tc carry her own policy to complete execution before the Allies cculd intervene effectively except at the extremities of Russia and Siberia.   7T. Kerensky replied that Germany already had possession of the Ukraine.   She had obtained this by threatening to divide the Ukraine and then compelling the Moderates, in order to save their country, to take power by leaning on German support,   She had adopted that policy in the &quot;Ukraine beoause sne wanted to draw her supplies frcm it, and &apos;that meant law and order.   As regards central Russia, Germany&apos;s game was that it should be more and acre demoralised until the Germans should then be welcomed as saviours. .The Germans therefore used the Bolsheviks to achieve this purpose,   M, Kerensky had sure information from his own espionage service that Count Uirbach had made this very statement of Germany&apos;o intention when talking to the Russian reactionaries who hoped for Germanic rule.- TJ&amp;- Government ought  c pay much attention to the news which appeared in the &quot;Times&quot; on Honday * to the effect that the Bolsheviks had made an agreement with Germany whereby Germany was to receive   the right to exploit the economic resources of the country in return for a loan.   Accord&quot; ing to the plan of which he had been told, this phase was to precede immediately the complete occupation of the country.-li. Ko-rensky said that he and the Coalition realise that if inter-vention took place and an Eastern Russian front was constituted the Germans would probably occupy the central part of Russia. This, however, would only be doing openly what they were practically now doing secretly.   If things went on as they were at present it was inevitable in any case.   The feeling was becoming 7fidespread in Russia that it was impossible to allow things to remain as they are, and it would be better that the Germans should restore order than that present conditions should continue,   This feeling was being exploited both by the reactionaries and the German agents.M. Kerensky said that the essential point he wanted to clear up was as to the attitude which the Allies took towards Russia.   The Coalition, which he represented, regarded itself as being the legitimate authority in ilussia.   The Bolshevik regime was a usurpation wh^.ch destroyed the Constituent Assembly, partitioned and ruined Russia and based its authority not on representative institutions, but on autocratic principles,   V-hen he and the people for whom he spoke talked about Russia still being in the alliance they were not using mereords or indulging in,ideals, they were expressing their pro-foundest convictionsr   They believed that the continuance of the alliance between Russia and the western Allies was essential just as much   to the Allies as to Kussia itself, because they believed that the. reconstitution cf I-ussia as an independent power politically, militarily and economically, was essential to any lasting peace.   The Allies must lock for their friends among the Liberal parties for whom he spoke.   They would get no real support either from tho Bolsheviks or the reactionaries. The only real policy was tc continue on the lines of the old alliance.
I then asked M. Kerensky what he thought would be the consequence&quot; of Allied intervention.   Such intervention must take place at the extremities of Russia,.   It must take a long time to develop real power even if the Allies had sufficient forces to make it really effective.   No Allied intervention could by Itself either save Russia or win the war.   To achieve any results it must either be. co-ordinated with a real move-ment of national regeneration or it must bring such a, movement into being,   M.&apos; Keajonoky replied., that there were really two questions Involved.   First -the mutual relations between Russia and the Allies must bo defined,-,. Intervention was not meant to take place without a clear understanding as to the relations between the internal forces in Russia and any force which might be landed at the periphery,- -These were precisely matters which had to be arranged. , The people whom he represented recognised that tho new front might have to be one drawn from the Volga and along the Urals,   Very likely Moscow would have to be given up, but the life and strength, of a nation did   not . consist in the number of square miles it occupies.   They did not consider that Russia was dead because of the provinces they had already lost.   They would not think&apos;so any the more if they lost central Russia also.   They had had this experience once before In the time of Napoleon.   In fact, looking at the question from the point of view of the war as a whole, and taking into consideration the war-weariness of the masses in Germany the reconstruction of an Eastern Front far into Russia with all the liabilities which it would entail for Germany, in keeping mi the population behind the linos might be a most deadly blow to the authority of the German Government at home..I then asked M. Kerensky what he meant by saying that the most important question was arriving at an understanding in principle as to tho relations between Russia and the Allies. Did It mean agreement about peace terms.   It must be obvious to him that however much the Western Allies regarded the re-construction of an independent Russia as an essential condition to lasting peace, it was impossible to expect them to go on indefinitely with the war, unless Russia once more  began to play an effective part.   There was some hesitation in regard to this matter, but M, Kerensky replied that the peace question was the most important point to clear up in this sense.   Do the Allies consider themselves free as regards Russia, as do the Bolsheviks as regards the Allies.   The Bolsheviks had repudiated the Treaty of London.   The Coalition which he represented regarded the Treaty as still in existence and as blinding upon-&apos;, them.   Do the Allies regard it as still in existence so far as Russia is concerned.&apos;.  At the present time it is Impossible to draw an absolute line of distinction between internal&apos;and external questions..  Everything that had happened in Russia arose out of the war, and the Provisional Government had refrained, from taking any stops in internal affairs which would have been beneficial to them,.if it had not been that they felt themselves bound by their foreign obligations.-By this I think he meant that the internal Bolshevik Revolution with its external consequences, the &quot;Brest-Litovsk Treaty, ought not. to be taken as representing the real judgment of Russia,&apos; but ought to be treated as being part of a temporary victory for Germany in the political&quot; as well as the military sphere, the Provisional Government and the Gonstituent Assembly still being the only authorities which were really able to speak for Russia.M,-Kerensky said that according.to their plans the internal organisation of Russia was an essential part of the policy of interventionAllied intervention and. internal reorganisation was &amp;uingle plasa. for the re const tuition o  a ftxcoian front- againstGormanyo  :  &apos;
As to t2$* time when intervention should take place, the responsible :people in Russia, were tho best judges as to when tho time was ripet [If thoy had not. been ready, and intervention would have made things worse,. hO&apos; would not have come.    to be successful, however, Inter-i vention must bo carried out in association with these Russian loaders and sections which enjoyed the support of tho boat elements of Russian opinion, so that the Russian people could bo assured that intervention did not moan the eventual annexation or exploitation of Russia by the Allies, but was being offooted under conditions which v/cro. consonant with the honour and dignity of the Russian nation.- &apos; ; I asked, %. KoTcnsky whether it was the. fact of intervention or tho i effective character of tho intervention which was the most important, i go replied the fact of. intervention under conditions which would show that, the Allios mount to support the national regeneration of Russia, fho essential thing was that tho Allios. should make it clear that ihey were really going to help;.I said thai I thought the Allios wero in.almost the same position, rhoy had tho utmost desire- to support Russia but naturally they.wanted to know what help they could expect from Russia in such an enterprise. If they wore to intervene and, after proceeding.a few -milos find that&apos; there was no real response from Russia, the whole proceeding would be Forse than useless,     I also pointed out that under present conditions intervention would be tantamount to an act of war against the de facto government which was absolutely opposed to intervention,, and that it ffould therefore mean intervention in internal Russian politics. E. Iverenslky. replied that we were not now under peace conditions and that revolution and coimter-revolution must now bo regarded as part of war policy,,    If one party in Russia was&apos; being sustained and 3upported and controlled by Germany,; it was essential that the Allies&apos; should sustain and assist the other unless Germany was to obtain 9 complete control over the whole country,,   The people of whom he spoke&quot;ere prepared to do their utmost to co-operate and&apos;to regenerate Russia, i&apos;Ee could give no proof of what they could do;,,, though he had informationto give in regard to the various military organisations- and their ^; contact with one another.    He was, however,, absolutely satisfied that ! Russia was on the verge of a great national movement of regeneration^ ;io felt it in his bones..    The position to-day was extraordinarily-Like that which preceded the first revolution of March 1917.Blvcjtybody balked i about revolution,,but. the power of the police seemed to be invincible.To-day a similar movement of national regeneration was in the air. i Ehe^ Bolsheviks occupied the same kind of position, as did the police ; fifteen months ago..   He did not believe that it would be difficult to syreep them aside,.   As to the Bolshevik attitude towards intervention^ ! if the Bolsheviks were favourable to intervention so much the better.-I If. thsy vnrh not,. lot intervention proceed lone the lass-,-M, - Kerensky then returned to the question of the relations between Russia and the Allies,.   He said that if we recognise the Bolsheviks we jraist accept the consequences..   The acceptance of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty hue ant that.the; Treaty of London became a scrap offpaper so far as -Russia was concerned...   l^iat thoy above all. wanted.&apos;to know; was what&apos; was fjtiic policy of the Allies in this matter..   Once they had got their &apos;&amp;nswor they could then decide upon their own policy.    Through his visit at any rate,. they would, settle the question of whether or not the old relations between Russia and the Allies still existed.    He again pointed out that:1 the -Provisional&quot; Government were the legitimate successors of the Tzar.. They carried on the&quot; national tradition. In turn they had handed^ovor to the Constituent Assembly.    The
-Bolsheviks wore merely usurpers.    Ho to.-day represented &apos;th&amp; Constituent Assembly and tho legitimate Government of Russia, They did not recognise anything the Bolsheviks had donfc,  -,rthat they -wanted to know Was whether. tho Allies considered, that the   ,   &apos; Bolshevik -regime had broken:their bid- relations with&apos; the legitimate authority in Russia,    If the Allies considered that t*io old relations had been broken, or if they could got no answer, thoy\ would regard thomsolvca as having a f reo hand. .;.In the course of this intorvlow, 1U Koronsky mado one inters e sting statement.    Ho said that ono of the Commissaries of the Bolshovlk Government had charge of Indian affairsj the purpose of his activitios boing the, brir^ ng. about of the , independence of India - from - tho British Empire...&apos;-(signed).&apos;-P.
