BNOLOStJKB.Copy of Joint Memorandum by.....the Ministry of Shippingand the Director oTl^ovements, far Office,.With reference to Joint Ufate No. 22 to the Supreme War Council by its Military Representatives1.   The question as regards the utilisation of the sea route between Marseilles and the Northern Italian Ports for the movement of troops as a supplementary route to the all rail and the rail-cum-march routes has been discussed by the War Office with the Admiralty and the Ministry of Shipping and the opinion has been reached that it would be exdeedingly difficult in practice to carry out this movement in an emergency with any degree of rapidity or suooess.   The chief reasons are(a) That it is very doubtful if at any given moment transports suitable for a movement of this nature would be available.    The British Troopships are normally fully employedon other services and it would be a matter of chanoe as to whether any of these ships happened to be at Marseilles.     It is probable that they would be working between Taranto and Egypt and if at the latter place it would take at least a fortnight to collect the convoy of troop and horse transports at Marseilles in readiness to embark troops, for Italyj   troop transports might be available in 10 days.(b) Assuming that ships were available it would be necessary to split up Units, sending the transport on horse-ships and the personnel in Troopships; tho destination of some ships would be Genoa and some Spozaia, which would probably entail further separation.    As a result of this separation, it would be necessary to allow some time for Units to be re-unitod and re-organised on thoir arrival at the Concentration Area.(o) The risks of enemy action on this sea route are very great.(d) It is calculated that even if ships and oscort wcro immediately available at Marseilles t*fc would take at least a fortnight to complete the transportation of one division from the entrainment area in France to the area of concentration in Italy. One week may be added for each additional division despatched by this route.    To these estimates must be added the time taken for re-organisation on arrival.In all circumstances it is therefore considered that the sea rout e is not suitable and should not be used for the conveyance of troops.2.   Approval has been given to form in Italy a reserve etook ef 1^0,000 tons of coal as recommended, and shipments to give 4 See   effect to this have already commenced^.   The above reserve will be ^.4972. placed in Italy in about six weeks to two months time (i,e. by the middle of August).3.   As soon as this reserve of coal is oompleted it would appear,   with reference to the penultimate paragraph of &amp;mexe II Joint Note No. 22,; that troops oan be sent to Italy with sufficient rapidity to meet the requirements owin/s to tho additional rail marches thereby set free, and that it will not be necessary to consider the passage of troops by sea.    The Shipping Controller is prepared to assist in the passage from Marseilles of such stocks of supplies as may be required to be sent to Italy concurrently with the troops, that is to say, uu to two or three ship-loads (i.e. 12 to 1 ;000 tons weight, or supplies sufficient for ten divisions for ten days.)
9 9r/4.     If the emergency arises before the reserve stock of coal in Italy 3s built up the Shipping Controller is also prepared to allocate tonnage (a certain quantity of which is always available I&apos;    at Marseilles and cab be diverted temporarily from other services) to aesist in carrying any part of the n6rmal requirements of 9.000 tons a day of coal now being sent Italy by the all rail route, which would be dealt with at the port of Marseilles or any other South French port, in addition to the amount-already being shipped via these ports, and if found necessary the Shipping Controller will consult the Admiralty as to diverting to Italy loaded colliers proceeding to,other Mediterranean areas.    This arrangement would-effect a. proportionate freeing of the all: rail route for the con** veyanbe of troops.5.    The general principle recommended therefore is that troops should not be sent by sea.    The sea route should be util* Isedfor the conveyance of supplies, and if necessary, coal, a$ cargo tonnage is more quickly available at Marseilles than troop tonnage and the delay and risk attendant on carrying troops by sea are avoided.&apos; 6,.    The closing down for the time being of the Cherbourg Taranto route as regards supplies for the Armies in the Bast can be faced.     It is agreed that ae soon as the suspension of the service takes place ships will, If required, be loaded in England to proceed to Bgypt, Salonika etc.. by long sea route.
