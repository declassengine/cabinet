SUMMARY OF BLOCKADE INFORMATION

June 14 - 20, 1918.

1. CO-ORDINATION OF ALLIED IMPORTS. The Allied Maritime Transport Council recently decided that Allied Committees should be set up in order to frame programmes covering all imports required by the Allies from all sources. The British, French and Italian Governments have already taken steps to form these Committees. The Committees will adjust the needs of the various Allied countries to the shipping available for supplying them. They will discuss the various Allied programmes with the Allied Maritime Transport Council and will arrange any necessary reductions according to a uniform scale. The Committees dealing with munitions will sit in Paris. They will act under an Inter-Allied Munitions Council, which will hold regular monthly meetings in Paris where the various Allied Governments will each have a permanent secretariat. The French, British and Italian Ministers for Munitions are all to be members of this Council. The Committees which deal with commodities other than munitions will sit in London.

We are urging the United States Government to appoint a member of Ministerial rank to the Inter-Allied Munitions Council at Paris and to nominate representatives to act on the various Committees in Paris and in London.

2. SWEDEN. Pending the organisation of the Swedish Importing Associations, which will control imports of rationed goods under the new Agreement between Sweden and the Associated Governments, H.M. Government will issue licences for rationed goods consigned to individual Swedish importers, and will accept a guarantee from the importers and the Handels Kommission in the form prescribed for the projected Association&apos;s guarantee under the new agreement. For non-rationed goods licences will be issued against a revised form of Handels Kommission guarantee, regard being had to the statistical position of the commodity.


?3. NORWAY. In consequence of the conclusion of the Norwegian-American Agreement H.M. Government have raised embargoes specificially imposed on various commodities imported. The commodities in question include hides, leather, tunning materials, nickel manufactures and nickel compounds, eggs and albumen, jam and soap.

The Norwegian Wholesale Grocers&apos; Association desire to purchase and import goods under the new Agreement on a cooperative basis through the agency of four or five of the principal Norwegian importers. They allege that the proposed cooperation will enable them to simplify their procedure and save tonnage. H.M. Government will not object to the Association centralising their purchases abroad; but we shall continue to insist on receiving guarantees from every individual consignee of imported goods. We could not sanction a scheme which would involve wholesale consignment to an Association.

Sir M. Findlay is informed that negotiations for an Economic Agreement are now proceeding between the Norwegian and German Governments.

?4. DENMARK. The United States War Trade Board insist that Denmark shall cede at least 465,000 tons of Danish shipping to the Associated Governments. This would leave only 350,000 tons for Danish services. As we noted last week, the German Government require the Danish Government to retain at least 400,000 tons. The Danish delegates at Washington have accordingly referred the whole tonnage question back to the Danish Government, who will again have to consult the German Government. Meantime the status ? in regard to Danish shipping is maintained, and this is all to the advantage of the Associated Governments.

The Danish delegates at Washington have made fresh proposals for restricting the exports to Germany of Danish produce. These, proposals are understood to have been approved by the German Government. The Danish delegates ask that the following exports to Germany should be sanctioned:-


Hog &amp; Dairy Products 700 tons per week.

Fish 25,000 tons per annum

Castle 6,000 head per week.

Horses 30,000 head per annum.

The Danish Government are prepared to prohibit absolutely the export to Germany of fish oil and hides.

The German Authorities are strictly supervising the Danish fishing boats which use German petroleum. They now require these boats to supply Germany with haddock and seising only. Boats using German oil which disregard these regulations are liable to be taken into port by the German patrols.

NETHERLANDS. The Netherlands Government recently decided to despatch a convoy of merchant vessels to the Dutch East Indies under armed escort. The first intimation of this intention was a statement of the Dutch Minister of Marine in the States General on April 16th. Sir W. Townley was immediately instructed to warn ? London that H.M. Government would insist upon their right of visit and search if the convoy should sail. The Dutch Minister in London thereupon informed H.M. Government of the composition of the convoy and of the conditions which would he enforced by the Netherlands Government in respect of passengers and cargo taken on board. Nothing, however, was said upon the question of visit and search. Almost simultaneously the Dutch Minister of Marine published an official notice in the Dutch Press to the effect that the commander of the convoy would not permit any examination of the convoyed ships.

This action of the Netherlands Government appears to challenge the right of H.M. Government to stop contraband trade by a regulated exercise of naval force. Sir W. Townley has been unable to ascertain the motive of the Netherlands Government. M. Loudon has said that the convey is being despatched with the intention of avoiding delays and a possible detention of the ships in a British port. Sir W. Townley thinks that the action of the Netherlands Government is merely intended to impress Dutch public opinion.   The Netherlands


Government expressly disclaim any intention of protecting by con-voy trade which would not &quot;bo sanctioned by 1UIU Government In the : ordinary way.   We have informed tho Netherlands Government that wo must oontinne to regard- the repression of contraband and tho enforce-Riant of tho blockade as lying with H.1U Government alono.   Since, however, the Netherlands Government havo already committed themselves to a public announcement, wo are, as on act of oourtosy, prepared in this instance to waive our right without prejudice to our general claim.    Wo have accordingly intimatethat tho right of Vie it and search will not be exorcised in this particular case providedfa) fall particulars are received and passed upon by tho British Authorities of tho cargo and passengers oar-rlod on the ships;(b) Mo malls or correspondence or private or printed papers arc carried except official papers of tho Motherlands Government;    and(o) A guarantee Is received from tho Motherlands Government that no cargo of enemy origin is being despatched *Tho Bailing of the convoy has been postponed by the Hothorlani Government until the various matters in dispute have been satisfno-tor ily settled.    tfe are4 In particular, $ejecting to the shipment of considerable quantities of dyestuffs of enemy origin which are among the cargo to be convoyed.Tho Netherlands Government have apparently authorised the ex-port of a number of cows in calf to Germany. We are representing; tin the export of those cows is a breach of the Anglo-Dutch Hides Agree-mentcICTHDAKDt   The Associated Governments aro making arrangements to supply Switzerland with an additional 40.000 tens of wheat from the United States.   The Swiss Minister at Washington has represented that owing to tonnage difficultlos tho Swiss Government cannot yet arrange for the transport of supplies from tho Argentine.
