All fessels of the types named above will bo fitted with single sorew triple oxpansion sjagines, steam being generated in boilers of tho cylindrical ty^e working under foroed draught.ABMAM8NT PROMOTION 2fbEaoh vessel conforms to tho regulations isaUoa under The Defence of Canada Act for vessels navigating danger zones, being provided with quick firing guns for asfonoe when attacked and equipment for protection from floating mines. All the vessels, with the exception of the 3,760 and 3,000 ton types, will have a sea speed of not less than 11 knots. The exceptions named, the ponstrwtion of whioh will be oonftoed to Shipyards on the Inland Waters and ^reat lakes, will owing to unusual proportions havo a sea speed of about 8 knots.CONTRACTS,The various Shipbuilding Companies in the Dominion,,  , were asked towards the end of 1917 to furnish the Department of Marino with the number of berths in the respective ship-yards available for new construction.Information received indicated that only two berths would be available during the early part of 1918, all other berths being occupied by vessels under contract for the imperial Munitions Board, Allied and Neutral owners.

In order, however, that the Government in carrying through its Shipbuilding Programme might be independent of outside sources of supply for steel,, a contract was entered&apos; into during April with&apos;the Dominion Iron and Steel Co* Ltd., for the erection of a ijRUite tell at Sydney, IT.SiThis Mill is no1.&apos;) under construction &quot;and it is antici-pated that rolling operations will be commenced about August, 1919,   The mill will be capable ;&apos;pf rolling to tho full re-quin;ments of the Dominion Government programme.- PRODUCTIOH.The amount of production will, up to the opening of the Sydney Steel Mill be dependent upon the supply of material from the United States and labour market conditions, in the Dominion.; During 1918 it is estimated that 4&apos;vessels will; be completed under the programme, aggregating&apos;about 21,000 dead-weight ,, tons.towards the end of this&apos; year it is anticipated that most of the builders throughout the Dominion will have completed&apos; their contracts with the Imperial Munitions&apos; Boardy v/ith the exception of Messrs; Coughlan     Sons, Vancouver, whose works-, were destroyed by fire&apos;on the &quot;14th May, and that the     &quot; -berths will then become available for the Government programme.; In this event,&apos; -the estimated deadweight tonnage per annum given in schedule No. 1 less part of the amount&apos;-ascribed, to Messrs Cougliian &amp; Sons say 38,.400 or about 245,000 tons should.be obtained for 1919 and thereafter yearly for a period to ;be &quot;determined, increasing as organisa-tion and equipment is improved.The term &quot;deadweight ton&quot; used throughout this memorandum represents all cargo, coal, fresh water,  stores, provisions.,- men and effects carried on board.OTTAWA,17th Mayr 1918.m    Q   m
