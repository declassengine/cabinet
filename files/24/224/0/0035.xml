SECRET..p.  500  (51).copy no.CABINET.INDIAN ROUND TABLE CONFERENCE * PRIME MINISTER &apos; S  STATEMENT AT.Note by the Secretary of State for India.The accompanying drafts based upon an earlier draft by the Prime Minister, has been re-submitted to him to-day for revision.    It is now circulated simultaneously to the Cabinet as a provisional draft in accordance with Cabinet 82 (31)s Conclusion 2 (b).(Intd.)India Office, S.W.1.27th November, 1931.
Copy Ho.    ___MOST SECRET.Draft Statement to close the Round Table Conference.We have now had two Sessions of the Round Table Conference, and the time has come to survey the important work vrhich has been done, first of all, in setting out the problems 7/hich in the task of constitution building we have to surmount, and then in finding the way to surmount them.    The reports presented to us now, bring our consultations to the end of another stage, and we must now pause and study what has been done and set going ways and means of bringing our work to a successful end as rapidly as possible.    I regard our discussions and our personal contacts here as of the highest value, and I make bold to say that they have raised the problem of Indian constitutional reform far above the mere technicalities of constitution-making;    for we have won that confidence in, and respect for, each other which has made the task one of co-operation, and that, I am confident, will continue to the end and we shall celebrate our final victory together.
At the beginning of the year I made a declaration of the policy of the then Government, and I am authorised by the present one to give you and India a specific assurance that it remains their policy. I shall repeat the salient sentences of that declaration;
&apos;.v: a &apos;a&quot;The view of His Majesty&quot;s Government is that responsibility for the government of India should be placed upon Legislatures, Central and Provincial, with such provisions as may be necessary to guarantee, during a period of transition the observance of certain obligations and to meet other special circumstances, and also with such guarantees as are required by minorities to protect their&apos; political liberties and rights.In such statutory safeguards as aay be made for meeting the needs of the transixional period, it will be a primary concern of His Majesty1s Government to see that the reserved powers are so framed and exercised as not to prejudice the ad.vanee of India through the new constitution to full responsibility for her o?m government.&quot;2.   With regard to the Central Government, I made it plain that v^sS^^^^^^^m^B^
subject to carefully defined conditions.   His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to recognise the principle of the responsibility of the Executive to the Legislature, if the Legislature were constituted, on a federal basis. \ You will agree that this implied due representation of both Stateske     TiTheand British in Legislature and Executive&quot; ; .. 1.&quot; principle of responsibility was to be subject^t to the qualification that, mr^r existing condijtrons, the subjects of Defence and External Affairs must be reserved to the Governor-General, and tha^^&amp;i^-^^i^igea^-^o^&quot;Mnanc-3ra3rTre^erR&amp;^Mrl4%gr\must -necessarily be subject to such conditions as would ensure the fulfilment of the obligations incurred under the authority of the Secretary of State, and the maintenance unimpaired of the financial stability and credit of India.Finally, it was our view that the Governor-General must be granted the necessary powers to enable him to fulfil his responsibility for securing the observance of the constitutional rights of Minorities, and for ultimately maintaining the tranquility of the States.I need hardly add that if was our view that the rights of the Services were to be securely protected.These were, in broad outline, the features of the
new constitution for India as oorxteaipla/tea by His Hajestyls Government at the end of the last Conference.As I say, my colleagues in His Maiesty&apos;s present Government fully accept that statement of January last as representing their own policy.    In -particular they desire to reaffirm their belief in an all-India Federation as offering the only hopeful solution of India1s constitutional problem.    They intend to pursue this plan unswervingly and to do their utmost to surmount the difficulties which now stand in the way of its .realisation.    In order to pls-e-e this declaration on a Vgis^ararntol^ arra s i iiSeT^r^r-insKre , statement which Iam now making to you will be circulated at once as a White Paper to both Houses of Parliament and the Government will ask Parliament to approve it on We one s d ay.    than*-4rfe*-ws*i^^The discussions which have been, proceeding during the -past two months have been of value in showing us more precisely the problems we have to solve, and have advanced iis towards the solution of some of them.    But they have also made it plain that the creation of a
o.Federal constitution for ali India will inevitably demand time for its accomplishment.    There are still many essentials which require further examination and negotiation, and we must all take them away at this stage and ponder over them for later decision.    There is still difference of opinion, for instance, as to the composition and powers of the Federal Legislature, and I regret that owing to the absence of a settlement of the key question of how to safeguard the minorities under a responsible Central Government, the Conference has been unable to discuss effectively the nature of the Federal Executive and its relationship with the Legislature.   Again, it lias not yet been possible for the States to settle amongst themselves their place in the Federation and their mutual relationships within it.    The oauss^m&amp;mM&amp;^mi^^mmm^ will not be advanced by ignoring these facts or by assuming that the difficulties the;- present will somehow solve themselves,    Further thought, discussion and reconei1iation of different interests and points of view are still requires before we can translate broad general aims into the detailed machinery of    a   workable   constitution. I   am
not saying this to indicate any pause in our work. I only wish to remind you that we are putting our hands to a task which demands alike from His Majesty1 s Government and from the leaders of Indian opinion care, courage and time, lest when the work is done it may bring confusion and disappointment, and instead of opening the way to progress may effectively bar it.   We must build like good craftsmen, well and truly:    OLir duty to India, demands that of all of us.What then is the general position in which we find ourselves as regards a practical programme for the advancement of our common aims?    The great idea of/^ll-India Federation still holds the field.    The principle of a responsible Federal Government, subject to certain reservations and safeguards, stands unchanged.   And we are all agreed that the Governors1 provinces of the future are to be responsibly governed units, enjoying the greatest possible measure of freedom from outside interference and dictation in carrying out their own policies in their own sphere.I should explain at once in connexion with that last point that we contemplate as one feature of the new order that the   North West Frontier Province should be
constituted a Governor1s province, of the same status as other Governor1s provinces, but with due regard to the necessary requirements of the Frontier.    It will also be essential to secure that, in the Eorth West Frontier Province, as indeed in all other Governor&apos;s provinces, the powers entrusted to the Governor to safeguard the safety and tranquillity of the province shall be real and effective.His Majesty^ Government also accept in principle the proposition which was endorsed at the last Conference that Sind should be constitilted a separate province, if satisfactory means of financing it can be found.   We therefore intend to ash the Government of India to arrange for a Conference with representatives of Sind for the purpose of trying to overcome the difficulties disclosed by the Report of the expert financial investigation which has just been completed.But I have digressed from the question of a programme in the light of the accepted factors -Federation as the aim and self-governing provinces and States as its basis.   As I have said, our discussions have made it clear to all of us that Federation cannot be achieved forthwith.    There is a mass of difficult
constructive work still to be done and there are many agreements to be sought by which our construction must be shaped and e emented.    It is equally plain that, by contrast with the difficulties and delays inevitably incidental to federation, the introduction of responsible government in the provinces would be a simpler task which could be accomplished in a comparatively short space of time.    The adjustments and modifications of the powers now exercised by the Central Government which would obviously have to be made in order to give real self-government to the provinces should raise no insuperable difficulties.    Ki^pMs^s^^s r-G^s^as^4i***etf*^^ the surest and speediestroute to Federation would be to get these measures in train forthwith, and not to delay the assumption of full responsibility by the provinces a day longer than isnnecessary.   But i^e-e-nks--of-the-parS^fe^e^-^ay-s-4iaj?e-? i^awa-^rt clear that *i)fe*9&amp;-^siew does not commend itself to you.    You have indicated T^lsfoaaMi^utimuv^^ihi^mmW^ your desire that no change should be made in the Constitution which is not effected by one all-embracing Statute covering the whole field, and His Majesty1s Government have no intention of -fin-^ing- i^^s&amp;sa* a
responsibility which, for whatever reasons, yeu consider^&apos;at the moment premature.    It may be that opinion and circumstances will change, and it is not necessary here and now to take any irrevocable decision. jCBui^^xah-^i^-^make^it plain that His Majesty1s Government would in no circumstances take any concrete action towards theintroduction of responsible government in the provinces inadvance of Federation without full consultation with indian opinion as expressed in the Legislatures, and through the---A.--agency of this Conference working in the way I shall &amp; p^ 1 4   i,p^e^nt4y&quot;-dB^e-r4*be^&apos;-ja&apos;&apos; It would clearly be indefensible,however, to allow iJaa.s_eimGlu.sion to stand in the way of constitutional advance in the Worth West Frontier Province.We intend therefore to take the necessary steps as soon asmay be to apply the provisions of the present Act relating to governor&apos;s provinces to the iThrth West Frontier Province.12.    The air ha\ been thick with rumours of late that our policy was in rearvintention confined to the Provinces. There was -never any ground for this misrepresentation.   We intend, and have always intended, to press on with all possible despatch with the federal plan.13.   We must all, however, realise that there stands in the way of progress, whether for the provinces or the Centre, that formidable obstacle - the communal deadlock. I have never concealed from you my conviction that
11/12this is above all others a problem for you to settle by agreement amongst yourselves.    The first of the privileges and the burdens of resx^onsible government is to agree amongst yourselve as to how these are to be shared:    this Conference has twice essayed, this task: twice it h&amp;s failed.    I cannot believe that you will demand that we shall accept these failures as final and conclusive.But time presses.   We intend to pursue our task and the time cannot be long delayed when we shall find that our endeavours to proceed with our plans are held up if you cannot present us with a settlement acceptable to all parties as the foundations upon which to build.    In that event His Majesty1s Government would be forced to-take the matter into their own hands, for they are determined that even this disability shall not be permitted to be a bar to progress.    This would mean that His Majesty1s Government would have to determine for you not only your electoral problems and your problems of representation, but also to decide as wisely and justly as possible what checks and balances the Constitution is to contain to
protect minorities from the free play of the democratic principle.     Such provisions could work satisfactorily only on one condition - that though they may be printed in the sections of an Act they never in practice have to be called into play: and that condition could be fulfilled only if they were based upon the common consent of all the interests involved.    I beg you to bring that about.So we intend to go ahead.    But the termination of this session of the Conference does not mean the termination of the Conference method - of -proceeding by consultation with the object of obtaining the greatest measure of agreement.    But many and difficult as are the problems which the Conference has left unsolved or has not yet even discussed, and great as have been the advantages of this Conference for pooling and sorting out general ideas, I think few of you will disagree with me when I say that we have reached a stage when real progress can be achieved only by a small body dealing with concrete and defined issues *  ^ I propose therefore with your consent to nominate in due course a small representative Committee -a working Committee - of this Conference which will remain in being in India, with which, through the Viceroy, we can keep in effective touch.
I cannot here and now specify precisely how this Committee can best be employed - this is a matter which must be worked out, but one obvious task which would fall upon it would be to assist us in examining the proposals of the Committees which will provide us much of the material for our future progress.It is our intention to set up at once the Committees whose appointment the Conference has recommended:    (a) to investigate and advise on the revision of the Franchise and constituencies,    (b) to put to the test of detailed budgetary facts and figures the recommendations of the Federal Finance sub-Committee and (c) to explore more fully the specific financial problems arising in connection with certain individual States.   We intend that these Committees shall be at work in India under the Chairmanship of distinguished public men from this country as early in the New Year as possible.    The views expressed by you here on the other outstanding Federal problems will be taken into consideration at once and the necessary steps taken to get better ^understanding and agreement upon them.
In addition to those specific activities, His Majesty1s Government have taken note of the suggestion made in paragraph SS of the Federal Structure Committee&apos;s last Report with the object of facilitating an early decision on the States quota in the Legislature and its distribution between the States inter se.    It follows from what I have already said that they share the general desire that an early settlement of these questions by the States to their mutual satisfaction is of the highest importance, and His Majesty1s Government intend to afford the Princes all possible assistance by way of advice in this matter, and if they find agreement amongst themselves impossible within the time suggested by the Committee, the Government will take such steps as seem appropriate to obtain a working settlement.
