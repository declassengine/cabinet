(THIS DOOUIviErIT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAi-IKIC MAJESTY&apos;S GD VERIOfflMT).1,.    I am anxious to Obtain the consent of my colloagues to the Introduction of a Bill directed to the restriction through the operation of tariffs of the importation into this country of non-essential foodstuffs which can be produced   in adequate quantities at home02.     The Bill, which will be limitod in its operation to 12 months, will not attempt to embrace all commodities which might reasonably be thought to come within the definition embodied in the preceding paragraph.     The object in thus restricting the scope of the Bill is to isomove any risk of increasing the cost ^f living to poor and midcile-class homes in this country,3,     The main purpose of the Bill will be:-(a) To make a contribution to the restoration of the balance of trade by restricting importsj(b) To provide growers in this country with an incentive to maintain or increase production and employment on tho land, and(c) To achieve the above results without inflicting any hardship on uOrking-class consumers.S3CR3T.O.P. 293 (51).C A B I H S T.IMPORTATION OP LUXURY FOODSTUFFS.Memorandum by tho Minister of Agriculturo andFisheries.
4.     Among agriculturists there is almost a unanimous concensus of opinion that the production of seasonal crops in this country should be protected from imports from countries furthor south which, owing to earlier   maturity, can be placed on our markot some weeks before home-produced crops are available and thus take &quot;tho cream of the market&apos;1 e     A decision by the Governmont to impose substantial duties on such &quot;earlies1&apos; will, I believe, confor upon the agricultural community a considerable advantage while inflicting a minimum of   injury to other classes *5,     I propose, therefore, that a Bill with the above objcot should be introduced in the House of Commons as soon as possible and pass through all its stages before the House rises for Christmas.     The Bill would apply to the following commodities:-FRUIT   -Early CherriesEarly PlumsEarly CurrantsEarly StrawberriesOther early soft fruit.VEGETABLES   -Early PotatoesLuxury vegetables suoh as Asparagus,Mushrooms4, Green Peas,Early salad vegetables such as Lettuce,Chicory, Cucumbers, Tomatoes, etc,FLOWERS   -Gut Flowers.
6. i am advised that the value of the imports in 1930 of the fruit and vegetables named in the preceding paragraph which arrived in this country previous to our produce being available in bulk was in the neighbourhood of  4,000,000.     The value of cut flowers imported during the year was about  750 , 000.     The probability is, therefore, that the Bill would affect imports of the value of about  5,0^0,000.7. As in the case of the Abnormal Importations Act,  the duties would be imposed by Order-in-Council.      The Bill would, however, specify that the maximum duty which could be imposed by Order-in-Ccuncil should not exceed 100% of the value. My proposal is that with the exception cf flowers, the duty should operate for a period to be prescribed by an Order-in-Couneil antecedent to the normal date at which home supplies are marketed in bulk and for a short period subsequent to that date.     In the case of flowers the duty would operate for the whole of the imports.     Where it is found impracticable to impose an ad valorem duty the amount of the specific duty would need to vary from month to month according to the average wholesale price of the commodity.     In this way the amount of the duty would be graduated so that it would, in fact, be removed shortly after the date at which home supplies become available in substantial quantities.8. It would net be necessary except possibly in the case of early potatoes to issue any Order-in-Council under the proposed Bill for several weeks after it received Boyal Assent and consequently the details could be worked out with the Customs, Board of Trade and any other Departments concerned in the interval.9. Although the above proposals are limited in their scope there is reason for thinking that they will be welcomed by the agricultural community because they will show that the
Government are not afraid of applying tariffs to foodstuffs, and will thus remove an impression which has become general on account of the omission of foodstuffs from the Abnormal Importations Act.(intld.)
