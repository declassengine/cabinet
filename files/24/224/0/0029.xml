*j o. no kj 0-IIS DOCUMENT IS THE) PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYS GOVERNMENT), EGRET.,CABINET. MANCHURIA, qMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreip;n AiTalrsaThe Council of the League of Nations is still discussing this question without securing as yet any accommodation be-tween China and Japan..,    While M*  Briand, who presides j  is hopeful of a happy issue from the proposal for a Commission which he is now putting before the contending parties, it is useless to shut one&apos;3 eyes to the fact that even if the pro-posed Resolution establishing a Commission of Enquiry was agreed upon, this -would be for the Council of the League a very imperfect successo    I am, however, still more concerned with the alternative which will arise if it becomes evident, as I fear it may,  that even this degree of success is impossf-ble and a complete deadlock results^    The decision then to be taken by the Council of the League will necessarily have a most material influence upon its future as an effective inter national instrument for restraining military action and securing peaceful settlements..    Moreover,  the part played I by the British Representative in the final stage of thediscussions has a material bearing on British relations with Japan and China,  and the whole incident may re-act pre-judicially upon, the Disarmament Conference-In reaching its decision on these matters,   so far as British policy and action is concerned,-, the Cabinet will wish to have before it a summary of what has happened^
rj rjThere has bewn ea unsolved Sino-Japanese problem in Manchuria for over twenty years - ever since the Japanese succeeded to Russian righto in tb?.t region after the Russo-Japanese war.      The Gh.lr.ese hove never willingly accepted the Japanese position in Mancl.a5.ri a *    In recent years  their resistance - for the most part passive - has taken on a more active charactero    There have been frequent incidents and great friction eventually culminating in the affair of September 18th last.    The Japanese military force guarding the sone of the South Manehurian Railway, alleging an attack by Chinese troops on the railway line just north of Mukden, carried out what was evidently a carefully prepared coup and proceeded to execute an equally carefully prepared programme,      They seized simultaneously a number of widely separated points in Manchuria and proceeded systematically to drive cut the Cninese authorities and establish their own authorities instead,,      On September 21st China appealed to the Council of the League ^ there in session at Geneva, under -Article 11 of the Covenant.    On Sept-ember 30th the Council adopted unanimously a Resolution in which it took note of the Japanese representative^ statement that his Government would continue as rapidly as possible the withdrawal of its troops, which had already been begun , into the railway sone in proportion as the safety of the lives and property of Japanese nationals was effectively assured and that his Government hoped to carry out this intention in full as speedily as may boo      She Japanese Government however, failed to carry out the assurances given    to the    Council which therefore met again at Geneva from October 13th - 24th, j The Japanese representative now adopted the attitude that 1 a preliminary agreement, binding China to recognise 1 Japan7s treaty rights in Manchuriaswas an essential &apos; element of security and must be a condition precedent to evacuation * The other members of the Council    /r?
*5 9 QQ til Oon the other hand maintained that evacuation must be a condition precedent to the negotiations for a settlement of the questions in dispute between the parties.      On October the 24th., therefore., the Council adopted a draft Resolution, by 1/6 votes to .1 (the Japanese alone voting gainst; calling upon Japan to evacuate within three weeks; namely by November 16th,. the data fixed for the next meeting of the Council.,        Owing to the want of unanimity, this resolution had no juristic effectc    Japanese military operations in execution of the    programme above described have continued daring this session of the Council as during the last *      The Japanese representative has been persuaded to propose that a League Commission should visit Manchuria and China,, but it is very doubtful whether agreement can be reached as to the terms of reference of this Commission.        The Chinese delegate has indicated that he does not reject.,  in principle, the suggestion of a Commission, out that its appointment should net furnish a pretext for cislay in Japanese evacuation-If the appointment of such a Commission, could be secured by general consent of the members of tire Council, it would undoubtedly be able to supply much useful information on points which arc at present obscure or disputed between the contesting-parties *
9 9 qt) wThere is a wide-eproad feeling, vhich I believe to be justified;, that although Japan has undoubtedly acted in away contrary to the principles of the Covenant by talcing the law into her own hands.,  she has a real grievance against China and the merits of the matter are complicated by a further consideration-.      This is not a case in ishich the armed forces of one country have crossed the frontiers of another in circumstances where they had no previous right to be on the others soil.      Japan owns the South Manchurian Railway and has been entitled throughout to have a body of Japanese guards upon the strip of land through which the railway runs.    Japan&apos;s case is that, having her armed guards lawfully there,  she was compelled by the failure of China to provide reasonable protection for Japanese lives and property in Manchuria in the face of attacks of Chinese bandits, and of an attack upon the line itself, to move Japanese forces forward and to occupy points in Manchuria which are beyond the line of the railway.      This has grown by degrees into what is in effect an organised occupation, leading in its turn to serious fighting and bombing.      But Japan continues to insist that she has no territorial ambitions in Manchuria - an expression, it will be observed, which doesnot necessarily imply that she is not thinking of some sort111 ,    &quot;;&apos; 1  I   &apos;    &apos;of protectorate5  at any rate in Southern Manchuria.      In spiteof Japan&apos;s protests to the contrary, there can of course beno real doubt that she is pursuing the course of nutting...     ^ ....    . ,   .   .     ^ ........ ^ .       .pressure on China by means of this occupation for the purpose of securing&quot; that the Japanese claims against China in that region may be met, e.g.   the  stopping of cut-throat competition, with the South Manchurian Railway, which Japan asserts isA
already promised to her &quot;by a Protocol of 1905 and the re-affirmation by China of the rights which Jap &quot;an claims to have secured&apos;by a Treaty of 1915 0It is necessary to consider beforehand the various alternative sitr.from.ons with which we may very shortly be confronted and. to form conclusions as to the possible action to be take no(l)    In the even!; of a partial success, i,e, acceptance of the Resolution which lias been pub before the partiesoIn this case the Council will have agreed to the despatch of a Commission of Enquiry which may ultimately produce very valuable resuitSo    But that Commission could not report for eight or nine months at the earliest, and meanwhile we have no assurance that the Japanese will evacuate tire territory which they have occupied, beyond the declaration tha the Japanese Government are ready to do so directly certain conditions have been satisfied.,    Unfortunately now that we know the real meaning of those conditions we must realise that there is no immediate prospect, of their fulfilment,,Therefore the Council &quot;ri.1.1 have failed in its immediate object of putting an end to Japanese occupation of Chinese territorya    It will have to look on while its own summons is ignored.,    It will have to realise that it has failed toenforce the fundamental principle  chat a Stats .ao2..3ot,.....without prior- recourse to the recognised means of peaceful settlement, take the law into its own Landa,The Council would be unwise if it attempted, to ignore these faots,,    It would seem to be far better,even, if the Resolution is adopted, that the Council should in some manner reaffirm the above principle, even though in this particular
*j it case it has been powerless to apply it effectively..     That would be an honest confession of weakness on the part of the Council, but that would be better than, a cynical abandonment of the fundamental pr inciple,upon which it has been attempting to build during these last IS years an organisation for the -preservation cf peace,,Any such declaration would evidently come best from the President himsolfOther members of the Council might en-dorse it and add any observations which they might see fit to offer,,But the question arises, if the President is not prepared to make any sufficiently strong declaration on this head and if there is no other way of achieving it, whether the British Delegate should take the lead in doing so,It is obvious that by taking the lead in this matter we should offend the Japanese Government,Here we have got to weigh the disadvantages against each othert,      On the one hand the immediate disadvantage to ourselves in losing favour with Japan;    and on the other hand the general risk, in which we share, is that the League,  in. refusing to reaffirm its true function, will lose so much respect as may yet be accorded to it in the face of ito failure to enforce its demands upon, the parti,es0(2)    In the event of&quot; failure to secure the adoption of the Resolution now under die cues ion, it ia difficult to see hew the Council during its present session, at least, could attempt to seek a solution in any other direction.Assuming that to he so, it would appear that the Council could do no more than it did on October 24thy namely, to reaffirm its &quot;Resolution of September &amp;Q and place again, on formal record its view as to the obligations /(
eJ    faOn &quot;both, par-tie SoThis of course would, be a confession of complete failure, not veiled even by the despatch of a Commission of Enquiry to the Far East.It may well be that the Chinese Delegate will put into effect the threat which he has often uttered, and appeal to the Council under Article 15 of the Covenant.Under that Article the Council must raize an investigation and could decide, independently of the parties,    to send out a Commission of Enquiry.      It has hitherto been desired to avoid the application of Article ID on the ground that it introduces a more menacing atmosphere.      In fact,  it seems difficult to see how the position is in that respect changed.        Indeed,  it might give a respite of six to nine months during which passion may cool. But II. Briand&apos;s own conversations with ;ue show that he is pexnsonally anxious to keep all discussion within Article 11.(Intld)    J.S.British Embassy,X Ct a J, u o3rd,  19-31.
