PERSONAL -BANE OP ENGLAND 12th November, 1931.Dear Sir Richard Hopkins,I enclose a copy of a letter signed jointly by the Chairmen of the Bankers and Accepting Houses Committees, together with a Memorandum of the contents of which they consider the British Government should be aware,Yours sincerely,(Sgdo^ Mo NORMAN.Sir Richard Y.No Hopkins, K.CB,
The Bankers1 Clearing House, Lombard. Street,London,    S,C. 10th November, 1931.Dear Mr.  Governor,As it has become clear that negotiations on the recommencement of Reparation payments are being initiated between Prance and Germany, the London Bankers&apos; Committee consider that both the Bank of England and the British Government should be aware of their views,, which are contained in the enclosed Memorandum0It is hardly necessary to point out that the stability of the London Discount and Acceptance market is being identified abroad with the stability c:  London&apos;s short-term credit relations with Germany.      A breakdown of the Standstill Agreement,  or a failure to renew it in some satisfactory form,would certainly entail very serious consequences on these markets,  as well as,   in all probability, another run on foreign balances in London,The Chairman and Sub-Committee,  appointed to deal with Standstill matters, will be very glad to wait upon you,  if you so desire it,  in order to have an opportunity of discussing the position with you.(Signed.)

10th NOTEMBEiR 1931MEMO&amp;dEDUM    OF    LONDON   BANKERS&apos;    CCMM1TTJCEenGERMAN    STANDSTILL   AGREEMENT.The Standstill Agreement arcse cut of the Seven-Power Conference which met in London in July 1931* That Conference declared inter alia that  :-&quot;In order to ensure the maintenance of the financial stability of Ger-many, which is essential in the Interests of the whole world, the Governments represented at the Con-ference are ready to co-cperate so far as lies within their power to restore confidence. &quot;The Governments represented at the Conference are ready to recommend for the consideration of the financial institutions in their respective countries the following proposals for relieving the immediate situation :-&quot;(1) That the Central Bantcredit of $100,000,000 recently granted to the Reichsbank under the auspices of the Bank for International Settlements he renewed at maturity,  for a period of three months,&quot;(2) That concerted measures should he taken by the financial institutions in the different countries with a view to maintaining the volume of the credits they have already extended to Germany.
&quot;The Conference recommend that the Bank for International Settlements should be invited to set up without delay a Com-mittee of representatives nominated by the Governors of the Central Banks interested to inquire into the immediate further credit needs of Germany, and to study the possibilities of converting a portion of the short-term credits into long-term credits. &quot;The Conference noted with interest the communication from Doctor Bruening relative to the joint guarantee recently placed by German industry at the disposal of the Gold Disccunt Bank.    The Conference are of the opinion that a guarantee of this description should make it possible to provide a sound basis for the resumption of the normal operations of international credit.&quot;The Conference consider that if theseform a basis for more permanent action to follow.&quot;2,. As a result of the express request of the Seven-Power Conference the Banking Creditors throughout the world accepted the proposal that they should take con-certed measures to maintain the volume of the credits which they had already extended to Germany,  and as a result the Standstill Agreement was elaborated and entered into.    So far as they are concerned the British Banks did so believing explicitly the declaration of
20Qthe Governments concerned that they on their part were ready to co-operate so far as lay within their power to restore confidence in and so to maintain  the financial gt ahi1i ty of G ermany.The Bank for International Settlements on its part set up the Committee referred to in the declaration of the Conference, known new as the Wiggin Committee.     We need not refer in detail to the report of that Committee, which in our view and within the limits of its terms of reference represents an admirable summary of the situationo      We are particularly    concerned with the last paragraph of the report on the possibilities of eon-converting a portion of the short-term German credits into long-term credits.      In their discussion of the possi-bility of raising a long-term loan the Committee state the followings-&quot;But %y,o fundamental difficulties remain which must be. frankly stated.      The first is the political risk involved,    Until the re-lations between Germany and other European powers are firmly established ou a basis of sympathetic co-operation and mutual confidence and an important source of internal political difficulty for Germany thereby removedthere can be no assurance of continued and pee.ce.ful economic progress.      This is the first and most fundamental condition of credit-worthiness. The second relates to the external obligations of Germany,      So long as these obligations, both private and public, are such as to involve either a, continuous increase in a snowball fashion of the foreign debt of Germeny, or, alternatively, a disproportion betvsson her imports end exports on such a seals as to threaten the economic -prosperity of other countries, the investor is unlikely to regard the situation, as stable or permanent.    Until the existing or potential creditors of Germany ara in a position to foresee what her future situation is likely to be in these respects a most serious obstacle exists either to the extension or even to the renewal of short-term credits, or to the raising of a long-term Icon*     Wo feel certain that the Govern-me-.it representatives at the London Conference, in taking the responsibility of recommending to the Bankers of the world that they should
take concerted measures to maintain the volume of the credits they have already extended to Germany, fully realised that their proposal was not a solution of the problem but a means of gaining time, during which steps for re-establish-ing the credit of Germany might be taken,&quot;&quot;But time is short,      The body of the world!s commerce - whose vitality is already low - has suffered a severe shock in one  of its chief members.      This has resulted in a partial paralysis which can only be cured by restoring the free circulation of money and of goods.      We believe that this can be acocm-pliehed;    bat only if the Governments of the world will realise the responsibility that rests upon them and will take prompt measures to re-establish confidence.      Their action alone can restore it,      He think it essential that, before the period of prolongation of credits recommended by the London Conference comes to an end, they should give to the world the assurance that international poli-tical relations are established on a basis of mutual confidence, which is the sine qua non of economic recovery, and that the inter-national payments to be made by Germany will not be such as to imperil the maintenance of her financial stability,n&quot;The clearly    defined and technical inves-tigatioii to which we have confined our attention does not permit us to offer suggestions of a political character.     But we have felt it to be our  duty to point out the reasons why it is impossible for the present to suggest definite plans for securing to Germany long-term credits., &quot;we wish,  however, to ado that  if a situation were brought about,  in which the confidence of the investing public in the future economic and political stability of Germany could be restored, we are satisfied that the consolidation of a part of her short-term debt and the prevision of the additional working capital needed by her trade and industry would present no serious difficultiesy There are many ways in which this object could be achieved.    If we refrain from putting forward detailed schemes to this end,  it is only because of our conviction that action which lies outside our province must first be taken before any long-term German bonds,, however well secured,  can be sold.&quot;wiye tiierefore conclude by urging most Earnestly upon all govehnmpnts concerned that they iose no see in taking the necess6.hy measures for bringing about such. gone it ions as will allow financial operations to bring to germany - and thereby to the world -sorely- needed assistance. &quot;
as far as the London Bankers&apos; Committee are aware, no formal steps have hitherto been taken by the Governments concerned to carry out the recommendations of the V/iggin Report.      The Committee, however,  cannot ignore recent press statements as to the informal negotiations coverin these matters which have taken place between Mr, Hoover and Mr. Laval, and which are now taking place between Mr. Laval and the German Government.The Bankers&apos;  Committee have no intention of entering upon political questions which are outside their sphere.    It is, however, highly important to them to know how far the reports are correct, according to which a preliminary condition is there laid down bythe French Government that Government debes in the form of Reparation, debts take priority over all private debts. It is impossible for the Committee to supoose that after the Seven-Power Conference had requested all the private creditors of Germany to maintain their existing credits to Germany,  and after the creditors had loyally carried out this request, the Governments concerned should now without further discussion with the private creditors insist on obtaining from the German Government a prior charge on Germany&apos;s exchange    resources to the detriment of all the private creditors,      This would be, if true, the more astonishing since the Reparation payments made by Germany in the last few years have only been made out of the resources in exchange placed at the disposal-, of Germany by her private creditors.      No payments made by Germany in settlement of Reparations in recent years could ever have been made had it not been for the money advanced/
by Germany&apos;s private creditors.The London Bankers1  Committee wish to draw your attention to what they regard as the fundamental issue in this whole complex situation,,  an issue upon which indeed the &apos; iggin Committee laid so much stress.    In order to avoid a much more unfavourable development of the existing acute world crisis it is vital that the confidence of all financial centres in Germany&apos;s capacity to meet her obligations should be restored. The return of such confidence depends partky on a settlement of the oembined Reparation and inter-allied debts problems,  and partly on the terms arranged for the gradual repayment of Germany?s private debts.    If it were possible to arrange for the extension for four or five years of the Hoover Holiday, then the gradual restoration of Germany and the rest of Central Europe to a condition of solvency should not present insu-perable difficulties.        If such a solution is out of the question, then there must be sought some other settlement  of these vexed questions which meets the fundamental condition referred to above of putting beyond question Germany1s future solvency.    If this is not the outcome, then obviously all foreign creditors will demand all their money back and use every means open to them to achieve this end, notwithstanding that such efforts on their part are bound to precipitate a still further deterioration of affairs in Central Europe and incidentally also to render any future Reparation payments out of the question.      If,  on the other hand, the world once more has confidence in Germany&apos;s solvency and in the stability of her exchange then some proportion, perhaps a considerable proportion
of existing short credits can he continued under properconditions, and the task of dealing with the balance will be considerably lightened.debtor in future,  it is essential that Bankers throughout the world should be prepared to continuenot do without a satisfactory arrangement in regard to the existing private debts due to then.      The London Bankers&apos;  Committee, therefore, do not consider that there is any likelihood of the Standstill Agreement being renewed without a really satisfactory offer to the creditors being made by Germany.8.      The London Bankers&apos;  Committee desire to state that, in their vie?/ the most important thing to be achieved for any alleviation of the world crisis, and, indeed,  ix worse developments are to be avoided, is the restoration of Germany&apos;s credit as a first step to a similar restoration in Central Europe as a whole.      For this again, the restoration of normal banking relations between Germany and the rest of the world is essential,      There is no chance of achieving this unless the German debtors are in a position to propose a satisfactory arrangement with regard to their existing short credits,9.      Germany&apos;s private creditors have nothing directly to do with Governments, but must look to their private debtors in Germany.      On the other hand, these private debtors must necessarily,  in view of the German exchange situation, be guided ultimately by the willingness and7,If Germany is to become solvent and to be a goodgiving short credits to her.This they will certainly
2Qbability of the Reichsbank and the Germany Government to allow a free exchange market, or, if it is restricted, provide the necessary exchange.      It may he pointed out that under the Dawes plan, Germany&apos;s obligations toward her commercial creditors were protected by the existence of the Transfer Committee, whereas under the Young&apos; Plan, that piotection has    ceased.10-        In these circumstances, the London Bankers&apos; Committee think their right course is to suggest to the Bankers&apos; Committees in other centres that all the private creditors should, as scon as possible, state quite clearly to the German Bankers&apos; Committee in Berlin, with whom they negotiated the i-tandstill Agreement, that they will not be able to continue that Agreement after pebruary .d9th, 1932, without some partial repayment of their credits, and without a satisfactory programme for liquidating the balance.    It will be for the German debtors to approach their authorities and for the German Government to approach other Governments with regard to the bearing of this request cn the other probi ems affected.j
% - - -16th Noveiater,  1931.Dear Mr. Governor,I have to acknowledge your letter of the 12th November enclosing copy of a letter and. memorandum received from the Clearing Banks in regard to the position of German credits.It is not  clear whether any expression of opinion from the Treasury is called for, but it seems to me that it is for the London Bankers Committee to get in touch with the German Bankers as soon as possible, with a view to settling how the obligations covered by the Standstill Agreement are to be dealt with,  in the event of their non-repayment.Yours sincerely,(Signed) R.V.IT.HOPKINS.le Right Hon.
