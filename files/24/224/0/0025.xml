DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1931,SECRET. Copy No,      9CP. 290 (31).CABINET.Sir John Simon to Lord Tyrrell (Paris).[W 13235/137/17](No. 2788.)My Lord, Foreign Office, November 20, 1931.IN the course of my conversation with the Minister of Einance in Paris on the 18th November, I informed M. Elandin that British opinion was considerably perturbed by the sudden imposition of the surtax of 15 per cent, on goods from the United Kingdom, saying that it was the first time, I believed, for nearly fifty years that either of our countries had charged the products of the other with any but the lowest duties applicable to any foreign country. I pointed out that His Majesty&apos;s Government had never exercised the special powers which they had obtained after the war to impose duties on goods from countries with depreciated currency so as to use them against Erance when the franc fell, but had only used them against Germany; and I added that the revalorisation of the franc seemed to His Majesty&apos;s Government in itself to give an advantage resembling a bounty on export to French manufacturers.2. M. Flandin sought to assure me that the new decree was not directed against Britain as such, and referred to provisions in it directed against agricul-tural products from Denmark, &amp;c. I said that we were concerned with the pre-juclicial effect on British trade and instanced coal, which, as I understood, would have 15 per cent, added to its invoice value, and this even though coal from Belgium and Germany and other countries, which was imported&apos; into France under contracts on sterling terms, would remain unaffected. M. Flandin questioned the accuracy of the view that British coal was affected by the decree, on the ground that coal was not a dutiable article under the French tariff, and the surtax only operated to increase existing duties.3. This, as I understand, is not so, and I was confirmed in my impression by the commercial counsellor of His Majesty&apos;s Embassy, who showed me the text of the decree and told me*that he had received a letter from Mr. Evan Williams, the President of the Mining Association of Great Britain, stating that the discrimination of treatment would amount to 20 fr. a ton.I am, &amp;c.JOHN SIMON.[6225]
