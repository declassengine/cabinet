[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1931. MOST  SECRET. Copy No.R.T.C. (31) 11.CABINET.INDIAN ROUND-TABLE   CONFERENCE. Cabinet Committee.NOTE  BY THE  SECRETARY  OF  STATE FOR INDIA.The accompanying Memorandum has been prepared by my advisers and myself after very careful consideration and constant intercourse with representative Indians. The course that we propose is probably open to many criticisms, but is not any alternative course even more vulnerable? Moreover, our plan of action has two solid advantages.Firstly, it gives us the initiative after a long period of most unfortunate inaction.Secondly, it has the strong support of the Minorities. The most significant feature of this autumn&apos;s discussions has been the consolidation of a single front by the Moslems, the Depressed Classes, the Christians and the Anglo-Indians.There is a grave risk of our having no friends in India at all if we disregard these representatives of the 12(.) million Indians who have hitherto refused to take part in civil disobedience.As to the Hindus, there is not, in my opinion, the unanimous opposition to our plan that some of them make out. Mr. Gandhi himself, although he has signed a letter against advance in two stages, has undoubtedly been attracted by it. Moreover, I do not greatly fear Hindu non-co-operation in the provincial autonomy stage. I do not believe that the Hindus can afford to stay out.S. II.9th November 1931.The Government and the Round-Table Conference.1. The present situation. (a) The Federal Structure Committee has agreed a Report which leaves many important questions out of those which it covers unsettled, and many other questions on which decisions will be required to enable a Federal constitution to be framed, not merely unsettled, but undiscussed.(b) The States Delegation cannot commit their Order further without further discussion amongst themselves of some of these questions in particular the distribution of the States&apos; seats inter se, and the financial effects of Federation.(c) There has not been, and is no immediate prospect of, an agreed communal settlement, and in the absence of this the Moslems refuse absolutely to discuss any question affecting responsibility at the Centre ; there is, therefore, no prospect of securing effective discussion of the nature of the responsible government to be provided by the Constitution, and the limitations to be imposed upon the principle of responsibility.2. In these circumstauces there appear to be two alternatives :  (a) On the assumption that a commuual settlement agreed amongst the communities themselves and accepted by all the Minorities is an essential prerequisite to further progress, to terminate this session of the Conference with little or no effective progress registered beyond the point reached last Januaiy, with a statement by His Majesty&apos;s Government that the Conference method has failed, aud that unless and until the communities can reach agreement after further discussions in India, no further steps can be taken towards the promotion of responsible government. 442  50  11.31
(6) To terminate this session of the Conference with a statement (i) of His Majesty&apos;s Governments intention to proceed (despite the absence as yet of a communal settlement) with the task of promoting self-government in India as rapidly as the inherent factors of the situation will admit; and(ii) of their policy and plans with that object.3. It is assumed for the purpose of this Memorandum that alternative (a) in the preceding paragraph will be rejected.4. Outline of His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s statement of policy. In spite of the failure so far to reach specific agreement on many important questions between the representatives of. the States and of British India, and of the evident evaporation from the minds of both parties and more especially of the Princes of much of that enthusiasm with which the suggestion was greeted before its implications had been realised, it can safely be stated that the ideal of Federation as the solution of the Indian Constitutional xDroblem continues to hold the field in this sense, at all events, that both parties realise that no plan for Indian self-government could be lasting, or probably even temporarily successful, which purports to leave the States outside its ambit.Probably few, if any, of the delegates could be brought to concede in terms  what logic aud history assert-that it is premature even to consider the plans for an Indian Federation, and still more to attempt to construct it, until those of the units which, are to be parties to the pact are in being in the shape of &quot;autonomous&quot; provinces, with sufficient practical experience of their individual needs and desires as such to be able authoritatively to formulate them and themselves to be parties to the creation, and the endowment with jDowers, of the Central organism. To concede this position would, be to acquiesce in the postponement of the Federal consummation for at least live and more probably for 10 years. At the same time, there is no doubt that there is now general recognition of the fact that the establishment of a Federal constitution is a process which will inevitably require a not inconsiderable period of time for its fulfilment ; and that Mr. Gandhi will receive little or no support for what ajjpears to be his conception that it would be practical politics to set up here and now a Federal organism endowed with full powers to prescribe its own functions, and to leave the settlement of all difficulties to this organism in the exercise of these powers.5. It is suggested therefore that His Majesty&apos;s Government should reaffirm, in the forefront of their statement of policy, their belief in All-India Federation and their intention to pursue it, and to adopt all possible means to secure its realisation at the earliest possible date.6. Safeguards and reservations. Flad a communal settlement been reached, and had it been possible in consequence to cover at this Conference the fidl programme of topics involved in the settlement of the details of a Federal structure involving responsibility at the Centre,&quot; it would have been necessary to invite the Federal Structure Committee to discuss and presumably for His Majesty&apos;s Government to have disclosed their own position in that matter the translation into definite detail of the somewhat indefinite pronouncements embodied in the Reports of the last Conference and in the Prime MinisteFs Statement of 19th January on the subject of &quot; safeguards and reservations.&quot;   Detail is of the essence of this matter, and experience has shown that it is impossible to gauge the effect and scope of any given limitation to be imposed on the powers of Executive and Legislature until it is translated into such terms as would find a place in a statutory enactment.   An attempt so to translate into concrete terms the general formuhe used at the last Conference was ,nade in the provisional sketch of a draft Constitution (Cabinet Paper B.D.G. (31) 8) and its complementary documents which were circulated during the summer, but circumstances have prevented trie consideration by His Majesty&apos;s Government of the proposals made in this document.7. It seems necessary, and indeed inevitable, that before the close of this session of the Conference His Majesty&apos;s Government should state their policy in regard to safeguards and reservations. Apart altogether from the position of the Congress, which in its extreme form repudiates any kind of limitations on full responsible government, the tendency of Indian delegates throughout the discussions of the last
few weeks lias been to assert that attempts to evolve and arrive at agreement on the form of Federal Structure necessarily lack reality in the absence of any indication -from His Maje.sty&apos;s Government as to the nature and degree of responsible government -at the Centre which, they contemplate. So long as the position and intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government in this matter remain vague and indefinite, farther effective progress is unlikely, mainly because of Indian suspicions that His Majesty&apos;s -Government do not in fact &quot; mean business.&quot;8. But granted that it is accepted that a statement on safeguards and reservations must be made, it has to be considered whether, before His Majesty&apos;s Government state their case, the views of the Federal Structure Committee are.to be sought in open -conference. (Another alternative method of ascertaining views would be by informal discussions with individual delegates or groups of delegates.)It seems improbable that any general measure of agreement can be expected between the Indian delegates and His Majesty&apos;s Government as to the scope and -character of any of. the safeguards contemplated, other than those, perhaps, which are designed for the protection of minorities ; and even in regard to these, unless (which ex hifpobhesi will not ,.be the case) they are the agreed outcome of a communal settlement, agreement and acceptance (if agreement is forthcoming) is not likely to extend beyond the representatives of the minorities. In other words, an invitation to the Conference (or to the Federal Structure Committee) to express their views on safeguards is likely to result in a generally expressed view that the safeguards indicated at the last Conference go too far, and in a general attempt to whittle them down.But on the assumption that it will be the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to stand by the safeguards indicated as necessary in January, it seems probable that a statement to this effect made at the end of the Conference would he open to more -effective attack if it were made without any previous ascertainment, of the views of the Conference than if there had been an opportunity for ascertaining the delegates&apos; -views upon them, even if there is a wide gap between the views so ascertained and those ultimately formulated by His Majesty&apos;s Government.9. After endorsing Federation as the settled goal of His Majesty&apos;s Governments policy and making clear the conditions which must attach to self-government at the Centre, it is suggested that the Statement should proceed to reaffirm generally the remainder of the Prime Ministers statement of January last as expressing their general policy.10. The next step would be to indicate the practical programme for the future. This would fall naturally into three parts : -(i) The appointment as soon as may be in time to enable them to start work in India in January next of the Committees Avhose further inquiries have been conceded to be necessary to provide the material required for the drafting of a Constitution Bill.   These Committees would deal with (a) the Franchise and the framing of constituencies ;(b) Federal Finance-the &quot;fact-finding&quot; budgetary Committee; and (a) Federal Finance   problems affecting the financial obligations ofparticular States ;(d) (possibly) the financing of Sincl as a separate Province.It will also be necessary to reaffirm the proposals in the Federal Structure Committee&apos;s Report designed to enable early decisions to be reached as to the grouping of States and the distribution of States&apos;seats in the Federal Legislature.k(ii) The intention to proceed at the earliest possible date with legislation. The complete working out of a Federal Constitution to the extent required to place it on the Statute Book must necessarily take some time, though His Majesty&apos;s Government will do all in their power to ensure that the process is brought to conclusion without avoidable delay. Meanwhile, they see no reason why the revision of the provisional constitutions should await completion of the federal scheme, and it is their intention to introduce a Bill
for this purpose in the summer of 1932, by which time the report of the Franchise Committee, at, all events so far as the Provincial Legislatures are concerned, should certainly be available.In this connection it will be necessary to include an announcement as to-intentions with regard to the Constitution of the North-West Frontier-Province and as to the separation of Sind.The North-West Frontier Province. A. separate Appendix, A, is attached on this matter, and it is suggested that the policy should be an undertaking that this Province will be given the status of a Governors Province with a constitution and financial settlement framed on the lines indicated by the Sub-Committee of the last Conference, as elaborated by the subsequent Committee in India, over which Mr. Ftaig presided.As regards Sind, though Moslem opinion will undoubtedly press strongly for a commitment here also, it seems clear that His Majesty&apos;s Government must, while accepting in principle the separation of, the Province, so word their statement as to emphasise the financial difficulties, and the need for a full examination of the practical questions still unsettled. The recent expert financial enquiry conducted in India as the result.of the recommen-dations of the Sincl Sub-Committee of the last Conference has demonstrated the magnitude of the gap between the resources available from Sind as a separate area and the annual revenue which would be required to place it on a financially sound footing as a separate Province&apos;.It should also be considered in this connection whether it is possible to-reconcile the Indian desire for as complete a picture as possible of the new Constitution in the legislative form with the undoubted fact that full details for this Constitution cannot possibly be ready by the summer of 1932, either by indicating that the Provincial Autonomy Bill will be prefaced by a preamble which will make it clear that that particular Bill is only the first step in the process of reform or, alternatively, by the process of obtaining, simultaneously with the passage of the first Bill, the assent by Resolution of both Houses of Parliament to the proposition that Federation is the aim and that the reform of the Provincial Constitution is the first step towards its-attainment.A statement of intention to proceed forthwith with the inauguration of provincial autonomy will necessitate a decision as to the changes, if any, to-be made by the Provincial Autonomy Bill (pending the introduction of a new Constitution for the Centre) in the powers of the existing Central Government in relation to the Provinces. It would clearly be a contradiction in terms to profess to set up &quot; autonomous &quot; Provinces and at the same time to leaA^e the Central Government with the same range of authority- over them as it at present possesses. The precise nature and extent of the powers to he exercised by the Government of India in the transitional period prior to the introduction of responsible government at the Centre will require careful consideration ; and any decision taken on this point would, of course, be-without prejudice to the ultimate decision on the vexed question as to the control to be exercised by a responsible Centre over responsible Provinces. It will therefore be prudent to avoid too definite a commitment on this-important matter at this moment.(iii) In view of the large number of questions of the first importance upon which agreement has not been reached and of the perhaps larger number of questions which have not yet even been discussed, upon all of which in both classes decisions will be required  for the purpose of framing the-Constitution Bill, it is evident, unless the ideas underlying the summoning of the Conference are to be abandoned, that some effective means must be devised for securing discussion   and, where possible, agreement on these matters.   It is also evident from the experience of this Conference and of the last that effective progress in discussion can be secured only when the discussion is focussed upon concrete proposals. &apos; It is suggested, therefore,, that the intention should be announced of summoning in due course to London a small body of representative Indian opinion in order to discuss,,, and, if possible, agree with representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government
their final proposals for legislation, (in this connection it should be noted that Lord Peel gave an undertaking in the Federal Structure Committee on 22nd October that the Government would make proposals before the end of the Conference as to the procedure for consulting Indian opinion on the many matters of importance affecting Federation which would necessarily be left undecided when the Conference closes.)As regards the composition of this considtative body, it will be essential when the second Bill comes to be dealt with that it should be composed&apos;in the main (apart, of course, from States&apos; representatives) of representatives of the Provincial Governments, which will, by that time, have started their career as autonomous entities, though they may have acquired little effective experience as such.    For the Provincial Autonomy Bill, which will settle the provincial constitutions, it is equally important that the Provinces should have full representation on the consultative body.   At the same time, it is important to avoid the charge that the Conference as a machine is to be scrapped with its work half finished, and a small Committee, selected by the Conference, might also be added to the consultative body of representatives of Provincial Governments.    It is hardly less important to endeavour to keep the size of the consultative body within manageable dimensions. II. The decision to introduce as soon as may be a Bill to reform the Provincial &apos;constituencies\itions or, more exactly, the decision to set up forthwith a Franchise Committee, will necessitate a decision (and the announcement of its terms and scope) by His Majesty&apos;s Government of the communal problem, since, in the absence of a settled basis of communal principles, it would be impossible to proceed at all.    It is suggested that the scope and nature of this decision should be on the following-lines :  (1) His Majesty&apos;s Government is not prepared to abolish any existing separate electorate against the wishes of the community concerned. This means, in accordance with the present demands of the communities, the continuance of separate electorates for the Muslims in all Provinces, for the Sikhs in the Punjab, for Indian Christians in Madras, for Europeans in Madras, Bombay, Bengal, the United Provinces, and Bihar and Orissa, and for Anglo-Indians in Madras and Bengal.(2) In those Provinces in which Indian Christians and Anglo-Indians have fixed representation by nomination the Franchise Committee will be directed to explore the feasibility of substituting separate electorates for nomination, unless the communities concerned prefer reservation of seats in joint electorates.(3) The Hindus will be entitled to separate electorates in any Province in which they are in a minority and desire separate electorates. The Sikhs will be entitled to a separate electorate in the North-West Frontier Province.(4) In the Punjab it is suggested that His Majesty&apos;s Government might adopt a scheme of distribution on the lines of that indicated in the Government of Indians Reforms Despatch, the principle of which is to give a statutory majority in the Council to no community.(5) In Bengal the existing proportion which members representing special interests and communities other than Moslems and Hindus bear to the whole Council should be retained. The balance of seats will be divided between Moslems and Hindus in proportion to their population.A note (Appendix B) is attached, showing how the proposals in (4) and (5) would work out.(6) In other Provinces minorities will continue to enjoy the weightage they possess at present.(7) Special provision will be made to secure adequate representation by means of separate electorates for the Depressed Classes. (See separate Note, Appendix C.)(8) The representation granted to the Depressed Classes, in so far as it is in excess of the representation at present enjoyed, will have to be found from among the seats allotted to the non-Moslems or Hindus.(9) Provision will be made in the Constitution that in any Province where separate electorates exist, the question of their continuance shall, after 10 years, be referred (either by referendum or through their representatives in the Legislature) to the community or communities concerned, and if a majority of the community concerned is willing to surrender the separate electorate, 442 B
Git shall be abolished. Provision will further be made for the question of abolition to be raised (under appropriate conditions) and settled in the manner described above at any time either before or after the compulsory reference at the end of 10 years.There are certain other matters apart from electoral representation in respect of which the minorities demand guarantees and on which a pronouncement will have to be made in connection with the communal decision in particular, the prevention of discrimination against European Commerce. A separate note is being prepared on this subject.12. If the lines above indicated are accepted as appropriate for a statement of policy and programme, the stage-management of the Conference with a view to-securing the best tactical ajjproach to such a statement has to be considered. The present position is that the Federal Structure Committee, having agreed a, Report on the structure and composition of the Legislature and certain other matters connected therewith (including the relations between the two Chambers), on Federal Finance and on the Federal Court, stands adjourned sine die, -pending the.summoning of the Minorities Committee and a decisiou by the Chairman of the Conference as to future business and procedure. It may be anticipated that when the Minorities Committee-meets it will report to the Chairman that further discussions and negotiations since it was adjourned on Sth October have failed to secure agreement ; further, it may or may not be found- -(a) that the minorities will present a united statemeut of their demands ; and (h) that a request will be specifically made for a decision by His Majesty&apos;s Government or by arbitration.(In any event presumabty the last-mentioned proposal for arbitration could not. be entertained.)13. In order to settle policy in dealing with the Minorities Committee, a tactical point of the first importance requires decision namely, whether or not, as assumed in. the preceding paragraphs, the publication of His Majesty&apos;s Governments communal decision is to be reserved for the final meeting of the Conference.1-1. As regards the actual conduct of business in the Minorities Committee, a point for consideration appears to be whether, in the event of the Minorities Committee reporting failure to agree, the Prime Minister will accept that statement as being for the time being conclusive, or whether he will suggest that he should engage himself in attempts as he did in December-January last by informal discussions with groups or individuals, to narrow down, if not to compose, the points of difference. No-doubt it will be difficult to arrive at any decision on this point until it is clear from the way in which the difference is reported whether there would be any chance of such informal discussions being fruitful. On. the other hand, such informal discussions would afford the Prime Minister an obvious means of ascertaining what measure of general acceptability was likely to be forthcoming to a decision on the lines indicated in para, il of this Memorandum.15. Whatever the decision taken on this point, it may be assumed that discussion in the Minorities Committee itself will not occupy more than a clay. The next step presumably would be the summoning of a plenary session of the Conference for the purpose of (a) dealing with the Report of the Federal Structure Committee ; (6) receiving a report from the Minorities Committee.Is the Conference as a whole then to be invited to state its views on safeguarding-and reservations (see para. 8 above) ? If so, this could perhaps be led up to on the following Hues.The Chairman might say that the unfortunate failure to arrive at a communal settlement has  prevented  the  Federal Structure Committee, and  therefore  the-Conference, from considering the many important questions still for discussion and decision relating to responsibility at the Centre, its nature, scope and limitations.. This being so, the Conference has reached a point beyond which it cannot proceed, and His Majesty&apos;s Government must consider and announce in a few days the steps tluyy propose to take in face of this situation.   Meanwhile, they are anxious to obtain all the guidance and assistance they can from the members of the Conference, and a useful purpose may be served if, taking as their basis the recommendations recorded at the last Conference, such delegates as wish to do so will state their views on the-aiature and extent of the safeguards which the Constitution ought to contain.
APPENDIX A.The North-West Frontier Province.A Committee over which Sir Denys Bray presided recommended in 1922 the -establishment of a Legislative Council in the North-West Frontier Province with an elected majority, and the appointment of a Minister to take charge of all subjects that were transferred subjects in the Punjab. There was also to be one official Member to assist the Chief Commissioner in the reserved subjects. With various safeguards this scheme was in form the same as that which existed in the other Provinces, namely, dyarchy. The Committee claimed that it embodied &quot;all the essentials in the reforms enjoyed by a major province.&quot; Prolonged discussions followed this report.   No decision was reached and no action taken.2. The Statutory Commission were impressed by the difficulties of establishing any form of responsible government in the North-West Frontier Province. They argued that responsibility for the administration of the settled districts could not be separated from responsibility for the peace of and control over the tribal area, and in view of this consideration and the intimate relations of the North-West Frontier Province to defence problems, they made proposals which, while setting up repre-sentative institutions, did not concede any direct element of responsibility. The constitution they proposed was in effect of the Morley-Minto type. They proposed to create a Legislature composed of elected and nominated members in about equal prorjortions, with powers of legislation (not extending to law and order or land revenue), interpellation and discussion of resolutions, and with the power of imposing-certain taxes and voting supplies in respect of those services which are maintained out of provincial revenues. &quot; But executive responsibilities should, as at present, rest with the Chief Commissioner.&quot;3. The proposals of the Statutory Commission gave rise to serious disappointment and discontent both in the North-West Frontier Province and among the Muslims throughout India, who had for some time been putting effective reforms in the North-West Frontier Province among their prominent demands. The Government of India in their Reforms Despatch commented on the fact that these proposals would leave His Majesty&apos;s GoveimmenFs pronouncement of the 20th August 1917 still unexpressed in the Constitution of the North-West Frontier Province at a time when the other Provinces were rapidly moving forward. They considered it a matter of the first importance that the scheme adopted should attract a reasonable measure of public support, and should not leave the way open for invidious comparisons between the form of government in the North-West Frontier Province and that introduced elsewhere. They accordingly favoured a scheme on lines approximate to the form of government proposed for other Provinces, but with provisions appropriate to the particular circumstances of the North-West Frontier Province and with adequate power secured to the head of the Provhice. They supported the proposal put forward by the Chief Commissioner which provided for a Legislature with an elected majority of one, while the Executive was to consist of the Chief Commissioner assisted by two Ministers, of whom one would be an official.4. The Sub-Committee of the Round-Table Conference went appreciably beyond the proposals of the Chief Commissioner and the Government of India. They recommended that the North-AVest Frontier Province should be given the stains of a GovernoFs Province. The Legislature, while still containing a nominated element, was to have a substantial elected majority. The Executive was to consist of a Governor assisted hy the advice of two Ministers drawn from the non-official members of the Legislature, at least one of whom was to he elected. It was added that, besides possessing all the powers vested in the Governor of a GovernoFs Province, the-Governor of the North-West Frontier Province should be the effective head of the provincial administration, and should preside over the meetings of his own Cabinet, but the official Minister proposed by the Chief Commissioner and the Government of India disappeared from the scheme.5. A Committee was theu set up in India, over which Mr. Haig presided, to work out the sphere of administration to be entrusted to the Provincial Government, constituted as proposed above, and to make proposals regarding a financial subvention from the Centre. Their conclusion was that there was no reason to withhold from the proposed provincial administration any of the ordinary provincial subjects, and in particular that law and order, as in other Provinces, should be a provincial subject, and should
consequently be administered by the Government described above.   At the same time it is to be remembered that the provincial administration proposed will differ from the administration of the other Provinces in certain important respects : -(a) There will be an appreciable nominated element in the Legislature. lb) The Governor will be head of his own Cabinet instead of standing outside it. (c) The Governor will not be bound, as the Governors of other Provinces will be in all ordinary circumstances, to act in accordance with the advice of his Ministers.(cZ) One of the Ministers may be a nominated member of the Legislature, though not an official.6. The recommendations of this Committee were well received in the North-West Frontier Province. They satisfy the insistent Path an demand for equality of status, while maintaining, as indicated above, certain important practical safeguards in the actual administration. The past history of the question of reforms in the North-West Frontier Province has given rise to a great mass of suspicion, and when Mr. Haig&apos;s Committee started its work it was generally believed in the Province that its object would be to impair the reality of the scheme of &quot; Provincial autonomy &quot; which the Conference had sketched. When it was found that this was not so, there was a corresponding feeling of relief. It is believed that if His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment now promises the North-West Frontier Province The status of a Governors Proviuce with a constitution and financial settlement framed on the lines indicated by the Sub-Committee of the last Conference, as elaborated by the subsequent Committee in India, the moderate elements will definitely take their stand by the side of Government in support -of these proposals, and the power of the extreme element which had allied itself (unnaturally) with Congress will be much diminished. The importance of such a result can hardly be exaggerated. Nowhere in India is Congress agitation a greater menace than in the North-West Frontier Province, and the alliance of any considerable body of Frontier Muslims with the Congress intro-duces a very disturbing element into the general relations between the Muslims and the Government.The Government of India&apos;s views have been asked for on this question, with particular reference to general policy and administrative security.APPENDIX 13.

The Government of India put forward a suggestion, as an alternative to the-Punjab Government proposal, that no community should have by its communal seats alone a clear majority in the Legislature as a whole, but that it should be open to them to obtain a majority by securing representation in some of the special non-communal seats. It has to be remembered, however, that the special seats, though not based on communal electorates, are such that it can normally be foretold what the community of the member will be. The principles suggested by the Government of India have never been worked out.   Before they can be worked out it is necessary to decide (a) what is to be the proportion of seats reserved for special interests, and in what communal proportions they will in fact be filled ;(6) what weightage is to be given to the Sikhs.It may perhaps be assumed (a) that the proportion of seats reserved for special interests should be that proposed by the Punjab Government ;(6) that the proportion of the communal seats to be alloted to the Sikhs should be not less than 18 per cent, (the existing proportion) and not more than 20 per cent.On these assumptions the following results would be obtained :  Special interests   - - - -      6&apos;7 per cent.Communal seats   - - - - 93 &quot;3     ,,divided in the following proportions: The Sikh, European and Indian Christian percentage being first determined, and the balance divided between Muslims and 442 - CThe total composition, adding together communal and special seats/is as follows Muslims -   42*2 -f 2-6 = 44-S Anglo-Indians        -     1*3Hindus   -   26-4 + 3-9 = 303 Indian Christians   -     1*3Sikhs      -   15-8 + 1-3 = 17-1 Indeterminate        -     3&apos;9Europeans - -   1&apos; 3 --100-0

A piossible scheme for Bengal would be as follows, based on principles similar to those worked out for the Punjab in accordance with the suggestions of the Government of India. It is assumed that the proportion of seats reserved for special interests and for communities other than Hindus and Muslims would remain us at present. The balance of the communal seats would be divided between Muslims and Hindus in accordance with their population proportion, i.e. 55 to 43.Special interests - - - -   20&apos; 4 per cent.Communal seats - - - -   79 &quot;6      ,,divided in the following proportions : Muslims - -   51 Europeans     - 5Hindus - -   40 Others- - -    4The communal seats would then represent the following percentages of the whole : Muslims - -   40*6                       Europeans    -          -   4*0Hindus      - -   31-8                     Others         -         -   3&apos;279-6The special interests would in practice he divided among the communities as follows : Europeans    - - 9*3 Muslims       - -   0&apos;8Hindus        - - 8&quot; 6 Indeterminate -   1&apos;720-4The total composition, adding together communal and special seats, would be as follows : -Muslims    -         -         - -   40-6 + 0-8=41-4Hindus      - 31-8 + 8-6 = 40-4Europeans-         -         - -    4-0 + 9-3 = 13*3Others and intermediate    -. -     &apos;6&apos;2-\rl&apos;7-   4-9100-appendix C.The Depressed Classes.It is generally agreed (except by the Congress) that some provision is required in the electoral system of the new constitution to give protection to the depressed classes. The number of depressed class electors on the present franchise is negligible, and the Simon Commission stated an incontestable truth when they said that even with a considerable lowering of the franchise there was no hope of the depressed classes getting their own representatives elected in general constituencies without special provision being made. The solution of the Simon Commission was to reserve seats for the depressed classes in the general electorates.   Recognising that the depressedThe special Interests in practice are divided among the various communities as follows : Europeans      &apos;-      -   9*3 Muslims   -      -      -   0&apos;8Hindus    -      -      -   S&apos;6 Indeterminate -      -   1*7
12classes would form ouly a small proportion of the electorates and that therefore there was-no assurance that the members returned in the reserved seats would realty represent their interests, the Commission proposed that the duty should be laid on the Governors of certifying which candidates should be authorised to stand for these reserved seats.. But the task of the Governor would be most invidious and difficult, and it would seem impossible really to secure the object in view by such methods.   It would hardly be open to the Governor to decline to allow a member of the depressed classes to stand for a depressed classes seat, and yet it would not be difficult for the higher castes to put up a candidate belonging to the depressed classes who would not represent the interests of the depressed classes.   There was a striking consensus of opinion among Local Governments that the Simon Commission^ proposal for reservation of seats would give the depressed classes no satisfactory protection.   The plain fact is that a&apos; representative will support the views of those by whose votes he is returned, and if the great majority of votes by which a candidate for a reserved seat is returned are those of the higher castes, he will do nothing displeasing to those higher castes.2. The Local Governments, rejecting the plan of reserved seats, were driven to-propose either separate electorates or nomination, if a true representation of the depressed classes were to be secured. Nomination is hardly consistent with the general principles of the new constitution and would do nothing to promote the political education of the depressed classes. Separate electorates would give true representation and political education, and they appear to provide the only solution if the necessary protection is to be given to the depressed classes. The Simon Commission felt that a system of separate electorates would stereotype the differences between the depressed classes and the remainder of the Hindus. This, however, is the general argument against separate electorates, and if the other minorities which require protection are to receive separate electorates, it is difficult to justify the-refusal of them to a section of the community which probably stands in greater need of protection than any other. There is no doubt what the demand of the community itself is. One of the most significant features of the Round-Table Conference this-year has been Dr. Ambedkar&apos;s categorical demand for separate electorates and the support which the Muslims have given to this demand.3. Two main problems will arise in working out a system of separate electorates. The first will be to define precisely which are the depressed classes.   This will have to be left to the Franchise Committee.    The second problem which may also have to-be entrusted to the Franchise Committee is to determine the quantum of representation  a difficulty which has to be faced eqitally under a system of reservation of seats. The Simon Commission proposed that the seats reserved for the depressed classes should be three-quarters of their population proportion.    Several Local Governments have condemned this as excessive.   It is difficult to strike a reasonable compromise between the principle of adult suffrage that all men are equalty entitled to the-representation of their views (which would justify the depressed classes being represented in full proportion to their population), and the principle of the limited franchise, that only those should vote who have reached a certain economic standard and therefore may be expected to have a reasonable comprehension of the matters at issue (which would give the depressed classes very trifling representation in proportion^ to their population).
