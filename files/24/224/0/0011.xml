CABINET, TRADE SURVEY COMMITTEE. commercial POLICY. Note by the President of the Board of Trade9In order that my colleagues on the Trade Survey Committee may be in a position to appreoiate the general principles which have guided this country in its commercial polioy and the principal objects aimed at in concluding commercial treaties and other similar arrangements, I have thought it well to circulate for their information the attached memorandum which was prepared in the Board of Trade under my direction about a year ago and has now been brought up to date (Annex I). I also append, In accordance with the decision taken by the Committee at their second meeting, a full list of all the Treaties and other engagements now in force under whioh the right to most-favoured-nation treatment is secured to us, with an indication in each oase of the length of notice which would have to be given should His Majesty1s Government decide to denounce any such Treaty with a view to being relieved from the corresponding obligations that the Treaty imposes on this country (Annex II).Whilst it is, of course, possible to regard these Treaties as hampering our liberty of action in oertain respects, it seems to me of primary importance that we should all realise the other side of the pioture, that is to say, the security that they afford for our commercial interests abroad.   It Is not, of course, the case that In the absence of a Commercial Treaty these interests necessarily suffer or that denunciation of a Treaty would necessarily have that effect.   Thus for aIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYjS GOVERNMENT.
number of years before the war we had no commercial treaty with Germany and our interests did not in fact suffer very material injury therefrom.   But presumably we should only embark upon a policy of denouncing treaties if we intended to mete out to the goods of a particular country or countries treatment which Treaty obligations at present preclude.    The situation that would arise in such circumstances would be one of an entirely different character from that whloh would exist if there had been no Treaty in force for many years. Once the Treaty was out of the way all our interests would be open to counter attack and the more resentment our subsequent action aroused the more certain and the more violent would that counter attack be.    Our nationals would have no guarantee against discriminatory taxation, or our ships against differential dues, and our goods would be liable to higher customs duties than those of any other country. The last possibility is no mere idle speculation seeing that many European countries make a practice of applying either over the whole range of their tariffs or over large sections of it rate3 of duty \which are lower in the case of goods originating In countries with which they are in treaty relations or which treat their goods fairly than in the case of goods originating in countries with which no treaties are in force or which adopt measures to which they take exception.We are familiar with the arguments in favour of a policy of Treaty denunciation fallowed by tariff bargaining, combined with the imposition of a general tariff.   We may not agree with these arguments but the policy is at least comprehensive and differs materially from one of embarking upon a course of Treaty denunciation and bargaining without having in our-S-
hands the same fiscal weapon in the form of a tariff as is available to other countries.    This is the more important inasmuch as a larger proportion of the manufactures of this country is destined for exportation than in the case of any other European country.      In other words, our risx Is greater, whether we consider our export trade or our shipping.   Until and unless this country becomes definitely Protectionist, it would seem more necessary for us than for other countries that we should continue to secure by Treaty our right to full and unconditional most-favoured-nation treatment and to insist on the full and unqualified observation of their Treaties by other countries.The case of Russia presents special features and is being dealt with in separate memoranda in accordance with the conclusions of the Committee at their last meeting.W.G.Board of Trade .27th May, 1931.
G cj)ANNEX I.MEMORANDUM ON COMMERCIAL POLICY.1. The Commercial Treaties which have been concluded by this country in recent years deal incidentally with a number of minor questions affecting British subjects, British goods and British ships, but are directed in the main to securing (1) equal treatment for our nationals in certain matters, and particularly in the matter of taxation, with nationals of the country concerned,  (2) equal treatment for our ships in all matters of navigation with the national shipping of the country concerned, and (3) most-favoured-nation treatment for our goods In all matters of customs treatment including both Customs duties and prohibitions.    It Is the third of these aims (which involves the question of commercial policy par excellence) with which   this memorandum is mainly concerned.    The latter part of the memorandum, however, deals also (a) with the special provisions in recent international engagements relating to prohibitions of importation and (b) with clauses in certain treaties affecting the imposition of internal duties on imported goods.Pjm^I^the MOST-FAVOURED-NATI OH 01AUSE ,2. The effort to secure most-favoured-nation treatment for British trade has been part of our Commercial Treaty policy for some hundreds of years.    To take only Commercial Treaties still in force between this country and foreign countries a form of the most-favoured-nation clause appears in the oldest still existing Treaty, viz., that concluded with Denmark (and Norway) in the year 1660, although in those days the clause was directed not to securing this treatment for British goods as such but to securing that British merchants sailing to the Dominions of the King of Denmark and Norway or &quot;exercising merchandise therein&quot; should pay no higher duties than those of other nationalities. It would seem that at that period
foreign countries had not embarked on a policy of differentiating between merchandise according to origin, but that they regarded Customs duties as duties imposed on the person.    In securing equal treatment for British merchants the practical object of placing British trade on an equality with its foreign rivals, was, however, achieved.    It is worth noting in passing that the clause made exception in favour of Swedes, a very early instance of a form of exception to general most-favoured-nation treatment which has lasted till this day and is referred to more particularly below.3.    It is not too much to say that the most-favoured-nation clause in its widest possible interpretation is and has for long been the aim towards which all our commercial negotiations have been principally directed.    In order to see why this is so it is necessary to consider the objects with which countries enter into Treaty engagements with regard to the customs treatment of their goods.    This object clearly is to remove so far as possible the obstacles to export trade resulting from the action taken by other countries and to minimise so far as possible the competition such exports have to face.    This competition is of two kinds,  competition by native industry and competition by other countries exporting to the same market.    The former can be minimised by limiting the amount of duty which is levied in the country concerned on imported goods with a view to protecting native industry,  the latter by securing that no third competing country shall enjoy special advantages for her goods.4.    Commercial Treaties concluded by foreign countries which possess general Tariffs accordingly contain a s a rule stipulations of two kinds.      They embody schedules of the actual maximum duties to b e levied by each country on long lists of articles of major
9 K 0 Jimportance to the other and they contain further a general stipulation that none of their produce and manufactures shall pay a higher duty than the corresponding produce and manufactures of any other competing foreign country.5.    Stipulations of the first class are, of course, only possible where a country has a general customs tariff applicable to a large proportion of the goods it imports, and is prepared to use its customs tariff for the purpose of tariff bargaining,  the essence of agreements of this description being that a country is prepared in return for specific customs concessions in favour of its goods to accord specific concessions in favour of the goods of the country with which the agreement is made.     On the other hand,  stipulations of the second class do not involve bargaining of the same description.      Nevertheless the fact remains that countries with high tariffs often find difficulties in concluding commercial treaties at all which free trade countries like the United Kingdom do not experience, so that protectionist countries are often deprived in many markets of that most-favoured-nation treatment which the United Kingdom almost invariably enjoys.    As a result it may be said with some confidence that although the United Kingdom is not generally in a position to make specific concessions in favour of another country, it nevertheless enjoys not a worse but a better position than protectionist countries which by virtue of possessing general tariffs have that power.6.    It has to be observed that the most-favoured-
nation clause on which^our commercial policy places its reliance has two sides.    In the first place it secures us against our other foreign competitors, in enabling our goods to compete in the markets of each country with which it is in force on an absolutely equal basis.    But in the second place if, and so far as, foreign countries are able to secure by their bargaining power lower rates for any description of goods,  then we also by virtue of that clause secure these lower rates.    It is sometimes urged by those who criticise our almost exclusive reliance on the Clause that this apparent advantage is rendered largely illusory by the increased elaboration of foreign tariffs involving very detailed classification. This, it is argued, places foreign countries in a position to accord benefits in favour of the special products of the countries with which they enter into negotiations whilst withholding them from products which a re of chief interest to the United Kingdom. To this there are two answers.    In the first place it leaves out of account the fact that each country carries on negotiations of the kind with which Europe in particular is familiar not with one or two but with a whole series of countries, so that it almost inevitably results that in so far as real reductions of tariffs take place they are not limited to one or two specialised products, but extend over a wide field. There is no country in Europe which has so wide a range of exported manufactures as the United Kingdom, and foreign countries would be hard put to it indeed to devise any far reaching reduction of tariff rates which did not accrue to the advantage cf British industry or which British industry was not able by
Q7o (Blight adaptation of its methods of manufacture to enjoy,7.    In the second place it is very questionable whether in fact negotiations such as are undertaken in foreign countries do involve substantial reductionsfrom duties which would otherwise have been imposed,though duties after the negotiations are, of course,lower than before they are initiated.    On this pointreference may be made to the conclusions reached on thematter by the Committee on Industry and Trade appointed in 1924 over which Sir Arthur Balfour presided. Thefollowing passage is taken from pp.17 and 18 of thefinal   report of the Committee.-8.    &quot;It is, however, frequently urged that GreatBritain by its commercial policy has put it beyondits power to conduct a successful negotiation, or totake its place on a footing of equality among othernegotiating countries each of which has something tooffer in the way of tariff reduction in exchange fora corresponding advantage.    This argument appears toderive little support from the report of theEconomic Conference,* which by clearly exposing thesuccessive steps of the tariff bargaining process by which the tariffs of the principal countries of continental Europe are normally settled,  showsconclusively that it cannot in the long run lead,and that as a matter of historical fact it has notleu, to a reduction of the general level of tariffs.    The tendency is in the opposite direction, andthis for a very goods reason.    Effective tariff bargainingin the ordinary continental sense demands that as a preliminary step tariff rates shall be raised.is * * * **   The so-called &quot;World Economic Conference of 1927.&quot;
Q Q 0 0&quot;Broadly speaking, it may be said that tariff bargaining as a normal method of endeavouring to obtain freer access to foreign markets is only possible if the actual negotiation is preceded by the raising of the tariff on one or both sides for the express purpose of giving a margin for bargaining.      Even then, as already mentioned,  the ebject is frequently defeated by the growth of vested interests in the interval which refuse to allow the intended reductions to be made, or by the failure of the negotiations for ether causes.      The final result of the whole process is more often than net a rise instead of a fall of tariff level,  if the comparison is made not with the purposely inflated rates of the &quot;tarif de combat&quot;, but with those which were actually in force before the first step towards tariff bargaining was taken.&quot;We can the more unreservedly concur in the condemnation of tariff bargaining on the continental model, because neither the ;principles on which the present British Customs tariff is framed, nor those advocated by any of the trade witnesses who have given evidence before us, would admit of C-reat Britain adopting the continental procedure as a normal method ef tariff construction.&quot;We do not believe that in the long run the negotiating countries obtain by such methods any material advantage of the only kind which is of interest to British trade, viz., the lowering of the tariff barriers by which overseas commerce is obstructed. Nor do we desire to see the British tariff (for whatever purposes and on whatever principles it may be constructed)
so framed as to permit or require that the rates of duty should he the subject of eventual bargains with foreign countries.&quot;9. There have, it is true, been occasions in which we have been able to secure guarantees inregard to the actual rate of Customs duties to be applied to our goods, but in the absence of a general tariff in this country such occasions are rare.     One or two instances may perhaps be given, (l) by undertaking to limit the duty en currants to S/- Por cwt. we have secured by Treaty a guarantee as to the duties on a large proportion of our exports to Greece, a country whose main concern is to find an outlet for her currants.     (2) The duties on a large proportion of our exports to Jugo-Slavia are governed by a Treaty which we were able to conclude owing to the special circumstances that we had claims on that country which we were ready to forego.     These claims arose out of an older Treaty with Servia to some of the provisiens of which the newly constituted Government 5f Jugo-Slavia had failed to give effect.     (3) In Siam and Persia we were able to attach to our consent to the grant of tariff autonomy in future certain provisions as to the duties on British goods for a term of years.10. Apart from these and other similarly exceptional cases our Treaties with foreign countries and the efforts of our commercial policy are directed to securing for our goods not actual specific rates of duty, but the lowest rates levied on any like goods from any foreign country whatever.     Some countries, like ourselves, adopt the system of a single tariff applicable to all foreign countries alike, and in regard to such countries the most-favoured-nation clause giveB nothing immediate though even then it is an insurance
against a change of policy.     But in a number of countries this is not the case and higher duties are imposed on goods originating in some countries than on goods originating in others.      it is obvious that in such cases it is a vital matter for our export trade to secure the application to our goods of the lowest rate.11. The principle is of such importance that in recent-years we have consistently declined to conclude any commercial treaty which did not embody this clause.     The last exceptional case occurred in 1882 when we concluded with France a commercial Treaty,  still in force, which specifically left Customs tariffs to be regulated solely by the internal legislation of the two States concerned and did not even embody a most-favoured-nation undeitaking on either side as regards customs duties.      Nevertheless we do in fact enjoy and have continually enjoyed the advantage of the minimum tariff in France by virtue of a French Law, and it might be stated not unfairly that there is a tacit though not expressed agreement between the two countries to extend most-favoured-nation treatment to each other.12. It is clear that for the most-favoured-nation clause to be *tf real value it must be drawn as tightly as possible and leave as little opening as possible for evasion.     .-a more general undertaking to treat our trade on the footing of the most favoured nation, although g )od enough in a temporary understanding is not sufficiently precise to secure all that we require.      It would be disastrous for instance if foreign countries were able to base differential duties on considerations such as the methods or conditions of manufacture, as it is frequently possible to indicate respects in which our manufacturing practice diffe. s from those of our competitors.     The essential point in our view is the nature of the final product itself, and the usual
practice we have followed is to stipulate specifically that the duty applicable to our goods shall not exceed that applicable to like goods of any other foreign origin.13. Similar considerations, apply as regards prohibitions of importation and we have always endeavoured to provide that no prohibitions shall be imposed on our goods which are not equally applicable to like goods of any other foreign origin.     There are, however, certain special conditions affecting prohibitions which will be dealt with below, but before doing so it would be well to refer briefly to the exceptions to full and complete most-favoured-nation treatment in regard to duties and prohibitions which re have been ready to admit in particular cases in our Commercial Treaties. These fall under the heads of Customs Unions, special geographical exceptions, Frontier Traffic, Sanitary and similar prohibitions and the treatment of bounty-fed goods.14. The first is an exception to meet the possibility that during the currency of a Treaty the foreign country concerned might enter into a full Customs Union with another. From the economic point of view the position is the same as would result from an extension of political frontiers and obviously we could not claim that because a customs barrier ceases to exist altogether whether as the result of political changes or of the formation of a Customs Union, our goods also should be admitted free of duty.     The only recently concluded Customs Union of any importance is that between Belgium and Luxemburg.15. The second concerns a few special cases in which owing to geographical contiguity or long historical association between two or more countries we have had to recognise the traditional practices by which special Customs favours are mutually accorded to each other by the foreign countries concerned.     For example we have thus recognised in our
treaties with certain Central American republics that the special tariff arrangements made with other Central American republics fall outside the scope of the most-favoured-nation clause.      Similar considerations apply in the case of our Treaties with the Baltic group of States, and in our Treaties with Spain and Portugal which permit of special tariff concessions to each other, whilst the consideration of historical association explains the right we have recognised of Portugal to give special favours to Brazil, of Denmark to give special favours to Sweden, and of Turkey to give special favours to territories which she lost under the Treaty of Lausanne.      In none of these cases is the derogation from full most-favoured-nation treatment a matter of any great moment to us, the actual extent of special preferences accorded under these arrangements being exceedingly limited, and the trade in question being largely concerned with merchandise of no great interest to this country,      The fact that we have given recognition to arrangements of this character of minor importance of course in no way affects the attitude we should feel compelled to adopt to any large scheme, such as has sometimes been suggested for the accord to each other of special Customs preferences by groups of important European States.      The movement in Prance,  for instance, towards the creation of a so-called &quot;United States of Europe&quot;, that is to say not of a Customs Union but of a body of States giving each other special Customs preferences as against the rest of the world,  is one which we should strenuously resist as cutting at the root of our most-favoured-nation policy, and not as being a minor derogation from it.16. The concession in favour of frontier traffic is designed to meet the case of countries with land frontiers. It is a common practice for such countries to allow of the free marketing of certain classes of goods such as agricultural produce over the frontier within a limited zone each side,
g 9This is designed of course solely in the interests of the dwellers in these frontier districts and our Treaties accordingly include in many cases a stipulation that special facilities accorded in respect of frontier traffic within a limited zone (usually one of 15 kilometres) will not he claimed by us under our most-favoured-nation clause,17, All these three classes of exceptions represent unimportant concessions on our part from the generality of the most-favoured-nation principle to meet the requirements of foreign countries.     They give us no substantial rights in return inasmuch as we are not likely to conclude a Customs Union with any foreign country, as we do not give and do not desire to reserve the right to give special favours to any country with which we have close geographical or historical connection, and as we are not separated by a land frontier from any other foreign country.     It is to be observed in this connection that our right to give Imperial Preference is not safeguarded by the insertion of any particular clause in our Treaties, but in the case of modern Treaties by the use of a particular form of words under which we claim and undertake to give to the goods of countries with which we enter into Treaty relations only the same treatment as is accorded to those goods of any foreign country, our right to give special treatment to Empire goods being thus tacitly recognised.     The use of this phraseology of course equally permits the countries with which we conclude treaties to accord preferences to their overseas possessions.     The other classes of exception referred to above, viz., those relating to sanitary and similar prohibitions and those relating to bounty fed goods, stand on a different footing in that they are provisions adopted in our interests as well as that of the particular countries with which the Treaties are concluded.
18. As regards sanitary and similar prohibitions, it is obvious that the exercise of the right to prohibit imports on these grounds is based on the conditions prevailing in the country from which the goods are derived, in other words, the very essence of the prohibition is that a distinction has to be drawn between goods like in themselves but produced under different conditions in different countries.    It is, therefore, not possible in this matter to give effect to the clause providing that no prohibition shall be imposed on goods from any country unless the like goods are prohibited from all other foreign countries,  and prohibitions on these grounds have to be excepted specifically from the general operation of the clause.   A reservation to this effect accordingly appears in all recent commercial treaties.19. So far as this memorandum has gone it will be seen thatthe object whioh has been consistently aimed at is to securethat with such relatively trifling exceptions es circumstances may necessitate British goods shall not suffer in any foreignmarket in competition with similar goods from any thirdcountry as a result of the tariff policy that the countryin which the goods are marketed may pursue.    This object hasto a large extent been achieved.     Commercial arrangements,whether in the form of full and detailed commercial treatiesor in the form of briefer instruments (modus vivendi orexchange of notes) expressed in more general terms, are inforce with every European country except Prance, where as already explained there is in fact a taoit understanding asregards duties and an actual treaty engagement as regardsprohibitions.    They are similarly in force with Turkey,Persia, Siam, China and Japan in Asia and with the UnitedStates and with some, though not all, of the countries of central and Southern America.    The treaty with the UnitedStates is not wholly satisfactory in this respect, as theUnited States Government have taken a less strict view of-12-
its implications than we do,  and have occasionally in the past refused to extend to the United Kingdom certain minor special concessions which they accorded to other countries condition-ally on the grant of special favours in return.    Practically, however,  the departures in the United States from the uniform treatment of goods of all foreign origin (except for the preference they hold themselves entitled to give to Cuba, though Cuba is of course not. under U.S. sovereignty) have been small in extent and indeed the c ases in which throughout the world we fail to get full most-favoured-nation treatment for our goods are few and of little moment.20. It follows,  of course,  in so far as this treatment depends on definite Treaty stipulations, and it does so depend in a large number of European countries which have Tariff systems admitting of the different treatment of goods of different origin,  that we have had to give reciprocal under-talcings and are ourselves precluded either from imposing different duties on goods of like kinds or on prohibiting goods without extending such prohibitions to goods of like kinds from all ether foreign countries.    In particular we are. in general, precluded from distinguishing between goods of the same kind,  in the matter of duties or prohibitions,  on the ground of conditions incident to their mode or conditions of manufacture such, for example, as their enjoyment of special state assistance or of bounties direct or indirect.21. The words &quot;in general&quot; are used advisedly in the previous paragraph because in certain of our treaties the rights of both parties to accord special treatment to goods enjoying a direct or indirect bounty have been expressly reserved.    The history of these special reservations is bound up with our attitude to sugar bounties which as accorded by continental beet growing countries were threatening towards the end of last century to ruin our cane
growing colonies by flooding the market with artificially cheapened sugar.    The expedient of meeting this competition so far as this market was concerned by apolying counter-veiling duties was considered so early as 1887, but the Law Officers who were consulted advised that the proper interpretation of the most-favoured-nation clause in our treaties was that the term &quot;like articles&quot; referred to the quality, nature and description of the articles and had no reference to the conditions of manufacture, and that it was impossible to argue that bounty fed sugar w as not a like article with sugar not enjoying such advantages.     An international Convention wes, however,  concluded in 1902 which obliged the parties to impose counterveiling duties on,  or to prohibit the importation of, sugar from foreign countries which a Permanent Commission, set up under the Convention,  found to be giving bounties to the production on exportation of such sugar,    Kis Majesty&apos;s Government took part in the Conference at which the Convention was drawn up and became parties thereto, and in pursuance of the international obligation did in fact prohibit the importation of sugar from one or two countries without regard to what had hitherto been considered to be their obligations under the most-favoured-nation clause of treaties with the particular countries concerned.22.  It was, however,  recognised that the action then take even though it was action in pursuance of an international&apos; agreement, was of a somewhat questionable character and it became the practice from 1902 up to 1924 to secure the insertion in our treaties of a specific clause excepting bounty fed goods from the general most-favoured-nation provision.    In fact our treaties with the following countries,   still in force,  contain clauses excepting bounty
fed goods from most-favoured-nation treatment in the matterboth of duties and of prohibitions: -Aus triaCzechoslovakiaEstonia. PinlandGuatemalaHondurasLatviaPanamaSlamSimilar provisions applying only to prohibitions but not to duties are included in our treaties with Spain and Portugal,23.    A clause on these lines was proijosed in the first draft which was submitted to the Germans in connection with the negotiations for a treaty with them in 1924.      They refused to accept the provision, which does not therefore appear in the Anglo-German Treatyt24.    About this time, the proposal to subsidise home-&apos; grown beet sugar was adopted in this country, and it was felt desirable not to press thereafter for the special clause exempting bounty-fed articles from most-favoured-nation treatments       The consideration that such a clause might be turned against ourselves applies now not only to sugar but also to silk and possibly to coal.     There is in fact little doubt that the United Kingdom system of draw-backs on export operates as an export bounty on some descriptions at least of finished silk goods, whilst it is arguable that the derating scheme under which the reductions of looal rates given to railways are used for reducing the cost of transport of export coal is to some extent of the nature of the bounty.      Accordingly the provision excepting bounty-fed goods from the operation of the general most-favoured-nation clauso has been omitted from all treaties concluded since 1924 up to the recent Treaty with Turkey.      In this
case and in this case alone the provision has boon reinstated at the instance of the Turkish Government.25. The present position is,  therefore,  that in the absence of a special clause dealing with the matter no country with which we have a treaty containing the most-favoured-nation clause in its usual form, unqualified by any special reservation such as that above referred to, would, in our view, be entitled to treat any particular description of goods that we export to them differentially, either In respect of import duties or in respect of import prohibitions on the ground of the existence of any alleged bounties or on any other ground based on the methods or conditions of the manufacture of this description of goods.    It follows, of course,  that we must equally continue to regard ourselves as bound vis-a-vis the foreign countries concerned and that to this extent the clause restricts acoion which those who suffer from the importation of particular bounty-fed goods (e.g. German wheat and oats) have represented as desirable.    As regards this latter aspect of the matter, however, it should perhaps be pointed out that to a great exporting country like our own the avoidance of any possible ground for discrimination is of outstanding importance, and that for this reason it is greatly to our interest to see that the widest and most unconditional interpretation is always placed on the most-favoured-nation clause-26.    Before passing from this branch of the subjeot it may be well to refer to the special case of goods
99    Idumped by. a particular exporter or group of exporters on a foreign market such a3 our own.    The Lav; Officers were consulted in connexion with Part II of the Safeguarding of Industries Act.    This part of the Act, which is now no longer in force, provided both for safeguarding and anti-dumping duties.    They held that the Treaty clauses, which provide that the duty on goods the produce or manufacture of a particular country must not exceed that on like articles the produce or manufacture of any   foreign country, preclude the imposition of a special duty on all the goods of a particular class or description from a particular foreign country, on the ground of general conditions such as exchange conditions prevailing in that country.    On the other hand, they advised that these Treaty clauses did not preclude the imposition of a special anti-dumping duty.on the particular goods which when produced in such a country are sold here at Prices below the cost of production, the reason being that the duty is not &quot;imposed on the goods of the country concerned as such, but only on such goods as are sold here on special conditions and that it can in fact be avoided by any exporter who does not resort to dumping, methods.    It is, of course, by no means certain that other countries would accept this particular line of argument, but it is mentioned here as being of some interest, though in fact no anti-dumping duty was ever applied in this country under the Act to any class of imported goods,,    The existing prohibition in this country of prison-made goods could possibly be defended on somewhat similar linea, i.e., that it does not involve the prohibition of all the good3 of any particular class or description from any foreign country,  and that the question of dufference of treatment between like goods from different countries does not, therefore, arise.PART II. PROHIBITIONS OF IMPORTATION AND EXPORTATION.27. Prohibitions, especially Prohibitions of importation, raise problems special to themselves.. So long as prohibitionsI
were absolute in character, as they were generally In pre-war days, the ordinary form of most-favoured-nation clause adequately safeguarded British interests.    As explained above the most-fnvcured-nation principle is not applicable at least in its full unconditional form to prohibitions imposed for sanitary reasons, though even in this case it is impossible to provide  (and a provision in the sense is to be found in the Anglo-German treaty) that prohibitions of this character shall only be enforced in regard to particular country if they are enforced in regard to other countries where similar conditions prevail.    The object of such a 3tipi.ilation is, however, to secure that a prohibition is imposed bona fide for sanitary reasons rather than to eliminate the discrimination which is to some extent inherent In prohibitions of this nature,    The same is true of prohibitions of the importation of goods from a country in which they enjoy a bounty, where such prohibitions are permitted under the provisions of any particular treaty. As regards other absolute prohibitions, however, unconditional most-favoured-nation treatment can obviously be given and is accordingly stipulated for in our treaties,28.    During the war,  an entirely different class of prohibition grew up, viz., a prohibition qualified by licence aimed not at preventing but at controlling the trade in a particular article.    For many reasons the necessity of restricting importation under war conditions was so vital that many countries, including the United Kingdom, felt it necessary to do this by direct methods, and;, instead of adopting the old but Indirect expedient of a Customs tariff, directly limited quantities of particular goods imported by Prohibiting their importation and issuing licences for limited quantities.   In the United Kingdom the primary object of our import prohibitions was to economise tonnage
litand to necure that the available tonnage epaoe should be used for the importation of foodstuffs and raw materials, instead of being frittered away in the importation of good3 of less necessity to our national economy, and most 9f theae prohibitions were swept away with the termination Of the war.    Unfortunately, other European countries faced with continuing exchange difficulties maintained and even developed the practice,  so that in the early post-war years trade was hampered not merely by high Customs duties, but by an excessive number of prohibitions, mitigated by licences.29. How this method of restricting imports was open to two classes of objection from the point of view of an exporting country such as ourselves.    In the first place it made the most-favoured-nation clause almost meaningless, because it is almoet impossible to lay down general principles as to the quantities of any particular article which we could reasonably claim should be allowed to be imported from the United Kingdom in relation to the quantities allowed to be imported from any other country, and we could only claim a generally equitable treatment in this respect.    On the one hand it would obviously not be equitable that, because only a certain quantity of cotton.goods were allowed to be imported into some specified country from, say, Prance, we should only be allowed to send the same quantity having regard to the fact that in normal circumstances we should have sent much larger quantities;    on the other hand we could hardly claim the right to seen such goods as silts in equal quantities with the   great silk exporting countries.50. But quite apart from the inherent difficulties of determining what constituted equitable treatment for our trade the whole system of prohibition and licence was one calculated to impose on our trade the greatest of all
1 A&apos;?2, - NEtf ZKALAND.Section 11 of the Customs Amendment Act,  1921, provides aa follows:-(l) In any of the cases hereinafter specified in this section there may, in addition to any other duties of Customs, he imposed on goods imported into New Zealand a special duty Of Customs (herein referred to as a dumping duty).(2) A dumping duty as aforesaid may he levied in any of the cases following, namely:-(a) In the case of goods imported into New Zealand of a class or kind produced in New Zealand if the actual selling-price of the goods to an importer in New Zealand is less than the current domestic value of such goods determined in accordance with the provisions of the principal Act (i.e., the Customs Act):(b) In the case of goods imported into New Zealand if theactual selling-price of the goods to an importer in New Zealand is, in the opinion of the Minister, less than the cost of production (including a reasonable profit) of similar goods in the country of origin or the country of exportation to New Zealand as at the time of such exportation:(c) In the case of goods imported into New Zealand of a class or kind produced in New Zealand, or in the case of goods of a class or Kind produced in some other part of the British dominions and imported from a country not being part of the British dominions, if the Minister is satisfied that any special concession (whether by way of railway or shipping freight, subsidy, special bounty, rebate, or otherwise) has been or is to be allowed, taken, or granted, and if such concession will, in the opinion of the Minister, have an effect prejudicial or injurious to any industry or business established or carried on in New Zealand, or in such other part of the British dominions as aforesaid.     For the purposes of this section the determination by the Minister of the amount of any such concession shall be final.(3) The rate or amount of dumping duty levied under this section shall be determined as follows:-(a) In the case of goods to which paragraph (a) oi  thelast preceding subsection applies, the dumping duty shall be an amount, to be determined by the Minister, not exceeding the difference between the actual selling-price of the goods and the current domestic value of such goods:
1 y (j(a) Public Safety;(b) Sanitary grounds or for protection of animals and plants against diseases and pests;(c) In respect of weapons, ammunition and war material and, under exceptional circumstances, also in respect of other materials needed in war;(d) For the purpose of prohibiting the importation of articles where such prohibition is imposed under the Patent Laws of the respective parties;(e) For the purpose of extending to foreign goods prohibitions and restrictions which are or may hereafter be imposed by internal legislation upon the production, sale, consumption or providing within the territories of the party concerned of goods of the same kind produced within these territories, including,  in particular,  goods which are the subject of a State monopoly or similar arrangement.32. It was agreed that these provisions did not preclude the making of reasonable regulations as to the manner, form or place of importation or the marketing of imported goods, or the enforcement of these regulations by the prohibition of the importation of goods which did not comply with them.33. The only other country with which a similar bilateral agreement has been concluded in Persia, and in that case the Treaty though provisionally in force has not yet been formally ratified.      It is, however, to be observed that as the result of the operation of the ordinary most-favoured-nation clause we are in fact bound not to impose against most other countries with which we have Treaties any prohibitions.which we do not impose against Germany i.e. any new prohibitions other than those of the categories above set out.      On the other hand other countries were not bound towards us by any reciprocal obligation so that the position was to a large extent one sided.    It was for this reason, amongst others, that vie took an active part in promoting the conclusion of an
international arrangement which would extend to othercountries obligations similar to those which Germany had undertaken in t he Anglo-German Treaty of 1924.34,    It is true that in the period following theconclusion of this latter Treaty the objectionable systemof prohibition and licence had to a large extent disappearedfrom Europe.    Traces of it still remained, indeed, notablein Poland and Czechoslovakia, though we had been able tocome to arrangements of an informal character with both countries which secure the importation of fair quantitiesof our goods.    The international agreement at which wearrived, however, was rather of the nature of an insurance against the revival of the systen than an attempt to get rid of these remaining traces,  and the actual agreementitself would in fact not have been possible if it had not included provisions for exceptions in favour of the variousparticipants who were each permitted to retain some fewprohibitions in force net justified by the general provisions of the agreement,    It is worth noting in thisoonnection that we ourselves were in this position as wehad to reserve specially our right to maintain the esistingprohibition of dyestuffs and intermediates..35.    Apart from these special provisions, and apartalso from certain general provisions relating to suchmatters as prohibitions for the safeguarding of therevenue and prohibitions of prison made goods,  theinternational Convention limits prohibitions of importationand expertation to the following olasses:-1.  Prohibitions or Restrictions relating to public security^8.  Prohibitions or Restrictions Imposed on moral or humanitarian grounds^
i. 0 ij3, Prohibitions or Restrictions regarding traffic in arms, ammunition or implements of war or, in exceptional circumstances, all other military supplies.4-. Prohibitions or Restrictions imposed for theprotection of public health or for the protection of animals or plants against disease, insects and harmful parasites,5. Sxoort Prohibitions or Restrictions issued for the protection of national trades of artistic, historic or archaeological value.6. Prohibitions or Restrictions applicable to gold, silver, coins,  currency notes, banknotes or securities.7, Prohibitions or Restrictions designed to extend to - foreign products the regime established within the country in respect of the production of trade in and transport and consumption of native products of the same kind.8,. Prohibitions or Restrictions applied to products which as regards production or trade can or may in future be subject within the country to State monopoly or to monopolies exercised under State controloThis list of exceptional prohibitions will be seen to be somewhat wider than that in the Anglo-German Tx^treaty but it follows much the same lines.36, It is clear that under neither instrument are we, as parties thereto, in a pos tion to impose prohibitions for certain other purposes which have sometimes been held to justify prohibitions, e.g,, the fact that goods are manufactured under unfair conditions of labour or that they are the subject of a bounty direct or indirect.     Any steps to secure liberty of action in such directions could only be undertaken as a result of fresh international understandings.37. The arrangement originally arrived at for bringing this International Convention into force was that it should ^:nly become operative if 18 countries agreed to ratify it before September 30th, 1929.      In fact the full number of ratifications was not secured by that date, but as the result of a further conference a special protocol was signed between 17 countries bringing it temporarily into force as from January 1st, 1930.
38. Owing however to the failure of Poland and Czechoslovakia to adhere to it, most of the signatories have since ceased to he hound by it and at present it only binds six countries besides ourselves, viz., Denmark, Holland, Japan, Norway, JPortugal and the United States of America.     Any of the countries can withdraw on June 30th in 1931, 1932, 1933 or 1934. PART III.  INTERNAL DUTIES ON GOODS.39. A third class of provision in Commercial Treaties which in recent years has been found to be an obstacle to actionadvocated by our agricultural interests still remains to be explained, viz. those clauses in our Commercial Treaties which guarantee to foreign products national treatment in regard to internal duties.40. The wording of the clauses is different in differentTreaties, but the form now generally put forward in our draftproposals for new Commercial Treaties is as follows:-&quot;Internal duties levied within the territories of either of the High Contracting Parties for the benefit of the State or local authorities or corporations in goods the produce or manufacture of the territories of the other Party shall not be other or greater than the duties levied in similar circumstances on the like goods of national origin, provided that in no case shall such duties be more burdensome than the duties levied in similar circumstances on the like goods of any other foreign country.&quot;41. The main object of such a clause is of course to limit to the actual Customs Tariff the protection afforded to national goods seeing that this Customs Tariff represents aknown and clearly defined obstacle to the goods concerned,whereas if our goods were liable to be submitted to further    /differential treatment in the interior and to treatment which; 4might well vary from localIty to locality traders would be in a state of much greater uncertainty as to the.actual obstacles to be encountered in disposing of their goods.     Putting the matter broadly, indirect methods of protection are likely to impose greater obstacles to trade than direct methods because
of the greater measure of uncertainty that they involve.42. A clause on these lines is of course of even greater moment, and is indeed positively necessary, in those relatively few cases in which our Treaties prescribe the actual maximum rates to be levied on specified claeees of Bri tish goods as in such cases it is evident that the whole object of limiting Customs duties would be defeated were it possible for the foreign country concerned to load the goods in question with differential internal duties after they had acquitted the Customs duties prescribed in the Treaty.43. At present clauses of one form or another securing national treatment In the matter of internal duties are to be found in our Treaties with the following countries44. Of these Treaties, those with Greece, Siam and Yugo-slavia contain provisions limiting the Customs duties on certain commodities, whilst the Treaties with Japan and Spain originally did so though the Tariff provisions of these Treaties are no longer operative.45. It is of course obvious that in order to secure these clauses we have had to enter into reciprocal obligations, and as there are other countries than those above named which could claim most-favoured-nation treatment in regard to internal duties we are in fact debarred from discriminating in regard to excise duties between, imported and home produce.     Any protection we desire to give to the latter must be afforded through the medium of the Customs Tariff.46. It is these clauses which it has been necessary to cite from time to time when schemes have been put forward for giving preferential treatment to British barley in connection with the excise duty on beer.Austria GreeceEstonia HungaryFinland JapanFrance (including LatviaAlgeria)PortugalRounmaniaSiamSpainTurkeyYugoslavia.Germany
f AOlb 6Conclusion.,47.    The general object of this memorandum has been to indicate the advantages we have secured in regard to the treatment of our goods by foreign countries by means of commercial treaties and other similar arrangements.    whilst little attention is often given to the objects of our commercial policy in these respects, public opinion is generally too apt to fasten on the other side of the picture, i.e.    on the extent to which we have tied our hands by these commitments.    The public frequently learn with impatience that, as a result of our treaty commitments, we are not in a position to carry out schemes which offer prima facie advantages to British interests in the United kingdom, but they seldom stop to think how great v/ould b e the&apos;risk to our export trade on which we depend were we not assured by these very treaties against action on the part of other countries which might well ruin it*
