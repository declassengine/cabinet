It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.SACHET.275 (51) . COPY NO,..3 a B I M E T. INDIA!;&apos; BOUND TABLE GOFFSHEITCE. report OF ClBIILiT CCM1LITTEB.The Cabinet Committee considered the Memorandumby the Secretary of State for India (H.To C(31)  11)  and discussed the problems raised by it in all their bearings.The Cabinet Committee agreed upon the following propositionswhich they commend for acceptance by the Cabinet  :-(1)    The Conference has reached a position in which no useful purpose will be served by attempting to prolong its discussions, and it is desirable to terminate them at a very early date.(ii)     It is impossible for His Majesty1s Government to dismiss this session of the Conference with the Statement that as the Delegates have failed to agree on a Communal settlement, and that as such a settlement is a condition precedent to constitutional progress, His Majestyts Government *s hands are tied and nothing further can be done,(iii)    It is equally impossible to dismiss theConference with the Statement that although His Majesty?s Government will pursue the project of Federation, they can take no definite step towards legislating for constitutional reform until the material for a Federal Constitution is complete.      The number and nature  of the questions to be settled before this consummation can be reached, and the necessity for obtaining a wide measure of agreement from the princes on many of these questions (since the co-operation of the Princes is essential and they cannot be compelled) make it certain that a considerable period must elapse before such a measure could be ready for introduction.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT - - w &quot; TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.
(iv)  It is vitally necessary in the interests of administration in India that uncertainty and indecision, which ax-e sapping the morale of the Services; should he terminated by a definite statement of policy by His Majesty&apos;s Government, and by action in earnest of that policy.    The reactions in India to either of the courses described under (ii)   and (iii)  above would produce a situation y.4iich might well result in definitely setting back the course of progress,(v)   &quot;Provincial autonomy-1 is an integral part of the Federal scheme, about which in no quarter have there ever been any effective doubts.    A. Bill to give effect to this part of the scheme could be ready for introduction early in the summer and could be passed at least by the end of the year,  if not before the recess,      Such a Bill would have, of course, to make -some relaxation of the powers of control over the provinces exerclseable by the Government of India and through them by the Secretary of State,(vi)  It would., however, be essential to giveconvincing assurances to India that such a &quot;provincial autonomy&quot; Bill is only the first step towards an India Federation and that Kis MajestyTs Government intend to do all in their power to press on the process to its federal completion.The Cabinet Committee consider that the only method of conveying such an assurance which will satisfactorily meet the requirements of the situation would be to give it by means of Resolutions passed early in the Few Year by both Houses of Parliament which would outline the intentions of Parliament and would make  it plain that an all-India Federation is of their final objective.A. definition of policy of this character and made in this manner would have the advantage not only of assuring Indians that there was no intention of stopping at --provincial autonomy1&quot;&apos;, but also of protecting His Majesty&apos;s Government against possible attempts of the new provincial Governments under Congress control to shape policy in relation to responsible government at the Centre on unacceptable lines.(vii) Meantime the Prime Minister&apos;s statement ofpolicj- at the end of the Conference in which tA.t.S^-alia this legislative programme and the contemplated Resolution procedure should be announced, should reiterate and reaffirm, as expressive of His Majesty 3s present Government?s general policy, the Declaration which wag made at the end of the last Conference on January 13, 1931,
(viii) It vrould be an essential part of the plan thus indicated that every effort should be made to ensure that the Federation Bill is ready for introduction about the time the new provineitil constitutions come into opero.tion, since a long interval between these two events would give scope for possible activities on the part of provincial Governments of the hind indicated above. But a &quot;provincial autonomy&quot; Bill passed next summer could not corns into operation for some months later; since time would inevitably be required to work out the detailed arrange-rn ents for franchise &amp;e,r provision for the enactment of which by Order in Council., Statutory Rules or other similar procedure would have to be made in the Bill *    And by the time this process is completed - say by the spring or summer of 1933 - sufficient progress should hare beon made with the preparations for a Federal Bill to enable its introduction about that date.(ix) In this connexion the Prime Minister should also announce His majesty&apos;s Gov orniru-nt; s intention to take immediate steps to set up the Committees required for further investigation into the franchise and connected questions and into Federal Finance (for which two separate Committees arc contemplated) in time to get them at work in India under the en ai man ship of prominent public men by the middle of January and for rendering such assistance as may be needed to secure an early settlement of the problems which are dividing the Princes inter^se in relation to Federation.If It can be arranged with the Princes it is very desirable that the Committee which is to recommend a method of distribution between the States of their quota of seats in the Federal Legislature in the event of their failing to reach agreement among themselves by 31st Marchs 1932, should also be designated at ence so that it may be available in India for consultation by the middle of January,(x) A Bill to inaugurate &quot;provincial autonomy&quot; will necessitate the adoption of means to remove the communal obstacle to progress: the decision must bs taken in tnna to enable the Franchise Committee to receive instructions based upon it?
i) The Committee recommend that the Prime Minister1s statement on this point should he framed on the following lines:-&quot;HsMoGVj have made it clear from the start that they regard the communal problem as one which must be solved by Indians themselves, .4 decision or award imposed ab extra would be no substitute for, and&quot;in no way equivalent to, a settlement by mutual agreement&apos;    the existence of disagreement is an obstacle to s e If go v e mm en t oBut H.L-I.Go, while they cannot for these reasons Impose a settlement as a permanent basis for a Consti-tuticn, are determined not to allow the failure of the Minorities Committee to bar the way to progress. Time presses; for the Franchise Committee cannot be set up without a mandate on this question.   Unless the Franchise Committee starts its work early in January it cannot complete it in time for the Intro--ductI on of a Bill in the early summer and if its work is not com-plete before the hot is oath or, there will be a year&apos;a delay;    again, unless the Bill be introduced in the early summer it cannot be passed this year. They propose therefore, unless the Communities can reach an agreed settle-ment amongst themselves by the 31st January nest  (in which case H.I.S. could of course adopt it) to take as the working basis of the Bill (and of the instruotions to the Franchise Committee)  the following principles, which are designed to mai.nts.in as nearly as possible the existing position, subject to such adjustments as are required to meet the facts of the situation - including the provision of adequate representation by separate electorates for the Do-pressed Classes in those provinces where the Franchise Committee find them to be a distinct element in the populationo      The Bill would make provision for the substitution of any agreement arrived at with the support of all the communities affected subsequently to the EIllvs enactment&quot;o
The proposed settlement would then he elaborated on the lines of paragraph 11 of the Memorandum R0TnC (31) 11 - in particular, it would follow? as regards the distribution of seats in the Punjab the Government of India1s first proposal in their Reforms Despatch and a similar principle v/ould be adopted in Bengal,(xii)    The Committee recommend that the announcementof intentions in relation to provincial autonomy should include as an essential, feature in it an announcement regarding the future of the North Test Frontier Province and Sind on the lines in-dicated in paragraph. 10 (ii)  (p,4) of the Secretary of State !s Memorandum R0T,C,(31) 11.(xiii)    Since the draft Federation Bill will necessarily contain decisions on many points of the first Im--portance which have either not been discussed at the Conference at all or if discussed have re-resulted in difference of vie?/, it is essential that some opportunity should be ensured to Indian opinion to exercise itself effectively on these questions before the Bill is considered by Parliament.      For this purpose a small Committee might be selected from the Conference, and pro-vincial opinion might also be brought to bear in the shape of a body of Ministers.      This consultative body should be summoned to London in due course to discuss the draft of the Federation Bill with representatives of His Majesty^ Govern-rrient.      It may he found that simi3.ar consultation would be useful for the Provincial Bill0(xiv)    Finally, as regards procedure at the Conference, it was agreed that the meeting of the Minorities Committee summoned for Friday next should be followed by plenary meetings of the Conference, The first of these might be summoned for Monday next and would be devoted to consideration of the Reports of the Federal Structure Committee,      It was further agreed that it was desirable that an opportunity should be given to Indian Delegates to express their vj.ews on the nature and extent of the limitations to be set to responsible government with a Federal Constitution in the shape of Reservations and safeguards, but that this debate shou3.d be closely contro3.1ed by closure and time-limits for speeches.      The Conference would then concj-ude with a statement by the Prime Minister on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government on the lines indicated above and every effort shou3.d be made to conduct the proceedings so that this statement can be made not 3.ater than Saturday 21st November. In this connection it will have to be recognised that much bitterness will be caused if the large number of delegates who vrill wish to speak at the Plenary are denied an opportunity of doing sot,
To summarise, the Cabinet Committee recommend to the Cabinet the adoption of the following, in relationto the Conferences  -(a)    That the Conference should be terminated as soon as possib3.e with a statement of policy and programme by the Prime Minister on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government on the following lines:-(o)    That His Majesty&apos;s Government adopt as their general policy the statement made at the end of the Conference by the Prime Minister on January 19th, 1931, and that they intend to invite both Houses of Parliament early in the New Year to register their formal acceptance of this policy by means of Resolutions,(c) That a Bill to promote provincial autonomy with appropriate changes in the powers of the Centre,  and with a constitution and financial settlement for the North West Frontier Province which will give it the status ofa Governor&apos;&apos; s Province and possibly a separate provincial constitution for Sinds will be introduced and passed next year*(d) That it should be made plain both in the Statement and the Resolutionsthat this is only the forerunner of a Federation Bill which will be pressed on to completion at the earliest possible date,,(e) That the Committees required for the purpose)f both Bills should be set up as soon as may be under the Chairmanship of prominent public men from this country,,(f) That Indian opinion should be consulted on the final proposals for both Bills before they are considered by Parliament, the consultative body being drawn in part from a Committee of the Conference and in part from provincial mini ster s.(g) That a communal decision should, if necessary, be adopted by His Majesty&quot;s Government on the basis for the operations of the Franchise Committee and of the provincial   Bill;    that its scope and details should be announced as part of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement with the intimation that it will be adopted only if the communities fail themselves to produce an agreed settlement by January 51st, 1932.Whitehall Gardens, So V. 1,, 12th November, 1931.TO-
