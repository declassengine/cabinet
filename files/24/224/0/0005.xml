He suggestedthat the works covered by this  2,100,000 should be eithercancelled or 6 preferred in agreement with the Treasury.If this was done, the resulting reduction of expenditure could be defended as an emergency measure of economystrictly comparable with the recent curtailment of the road fund expenditure.The Committee recommend the Cabinet -(1) That the Minister of Transport should be authorised to inform Lord Ashfield -(a) That if, prior to the passing of the Bill additional debenture stock is issued by the Underground companies up to a maximum of  1,500,000, the Government, in the event of their deciding to proceed With the London Passenger Transport Bill, will move amendments to the Bill providing for the issue of Transport &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; stock in the due proportionsup to the nominal amount of the additional debenture stock so issued.
