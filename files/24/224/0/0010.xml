BIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. EGRET.&quot;- CABINET.&apos;.S.0.(31) 8.-- TRADE SURVEY COMMITTEE.ANTI-DUMPING LEGISLATION. Note by the President of the Board of Trade.1.    I circulate herewith, for the information of my colleagues, a memorandum giving an account (Section I) of the origin and operation of the anti-dumping provisions of Part II of the Safeguarding of Industries Act, 1921,  and an account (Section III) of anti-dumping provisions which have been enacted in certain other countries.     The memorandum also sets out (Section II) certain statements which have recently been made as to alleged dumping of particular classes of goods at prices below either the cost of production or the selling price in the country of origin.2o    The term &quot;Dumping&quot;  is employed in a variety of senses. It is frequently used loosely to mean the sale of imported goods at prices substantially below those at which home produced goods can profitably be sold, the inference being that the difference in price is due to some &quot;unfair&quot; condition In the foreign oountry, such as a lower standard of wages or conditions of labour, or - in the oircumstances which prevailed for some years after the end of the war - depreciating exchanges.Used with more precision, however, the term &quot;dumping&quot; is usually employed to mean the sale of goods on importation at prices which are below either the cost of production or the selling price in the country of origin - with the addition in either case of cost of transport, etc.       The legislation described in the memorandum is directed against &quot;dumping&quot; in this more precise sense.
3-    It is noteworthy that anti-dumping legislation is by no means general, and the application of such legislation as exists ia still less general.      It appears from Section III of the Memorandum that specific anti-dumping provisions exist in the tariff laws of five of the British Dominions and in only six foreign countries, and that effect has been given to those provisions in only four British Dominions and one foreign country - the United States of America.4o    As regards the Treaty obligations of this country in the matter I would call attention to. the fact that when the Safeguarding of Industries Act was in course of preparation in 1921 the then Law Officers advised that Treaty clauses providing for the accord of most-favoured-nation treatment did not preclude the imposition of a special anti-dumping duty on particular goods sold here at prices below the cost of production.      It would, of course, be necessary that any anti-dumping measures that It might be decided to take should extend equally to dumped goods from all foreign countries. If, however, HiB Majesty&apos;s Government should decide in favour of the adoption of any such measures, it would clearly be desirable that the Law Officers should again be consulted as to the compatibility of the particular meaaures contemplated with the existing Treaty obligations of thia country.5.    The levying of anti-dumping duties involves the aacertainment of prcciae information concerning costs of production or prices in other countries.     Such information is necessary in the first instance in order to decide upon what classes of goods and from what countries duty shall be levied.     Moreover, if the amount of the duty is to be such as exactly to countervail the discrepancy between coata or prices in the country of origin and prices in the country of import, similar Information is also necessary in respect of each shipment.
It is significant that all those countries, viz., a number of British Dominions and the United States of America, which have enforced anti-dumping duties, are countries in which there is an import tariff under which duty is levied upon imports generally on the basis of their market value in the country of origin.     These countries, for the general purposes of tariff administration, have established machinery for ascertaining and checking such market values, which can of course be used in the administration of anti-dumping provisions.     Tho provisions of the Safeguarding of Industries Aot in this country relating to imported goods sold here below the wholesale price in the country of origin, were rendered entirely nugatory owing mainly to the extreme difficulty which complainant industries in this country found in establishing what was the wholesale price in the country of origin of the goods with which they were concerned.6.   Those facts show that any scheme for levying anti-dumping duties, in order to be effective, must provide for placing upon the importer the onus of producing evidence as to the selling prices of the goods in the country of origin, and for setting up some machinery whereby the statements so adduced can be checked,,     At present in this country the declared value of goods on importation is, in effect, the value at which they are invoiced to the importer and our ad valorem   duties are assessed on that value.    In other words, there is at present, no official information as to the selling prices in the country of manufacture of the goods we import, and there is no obligation on the importer to acquaint himself with such prices.      It would seem difficult to defend requiring importers of all goods, or of particular classes of
goodsj to secure the necessary particulars in respect of their importations in order tc enable anti-dumping duties to be levied on seme classes of goods, or some consignments of good3 within a particular class, unless that requirement were part of the machinery of a general tariff based on valuation by reference to selling price in the country of origin.W.G.Board of Trade,6th July, 1931.
1. For a number of years after the war legislation was in force providing for the imposition of anti-dumping duties upon imported goods sold in this country at prices substantially below the wholesale price in the country of origin.     In fact no such duty was ever imposed.     Provision was also made for the imposition of similar duties on goods which owing to exchange depreciation were sold below the price of profitable manufacture in this country.     Such duties were imposed in a number of instances.2. The Final Report of the Committee on Commercial andIndustrial Policy after the War which was published inDecember 1917, in dealing with the question of dumping (bywhich was understood the sale of goods in a particular marketat prices lower than those at which the goods are currentlyoffered in the country of manufacture) contained thefollowing recommendation:-&quot;The producers of this country are entitled to require from the Government that they should be protected in their home market against &quot;dumping&apos;  as previously defined,We recommend that action be taken in regard to &apos;dumping&apos;  on the lines (though not necessarily in the precise form) adopted in Canada.&quot;In 1918 the Minister of Reconstruction asked his Advisory Council -&quot;To consider the recommendations of Lord Balfour of Burleigh&apos;s Committee upon Commercial and Industrial Policy that legislative action should be taken in the United Kingdom for the prevention of &apos;dumping&apos;, and to advise as to the precise character of such legislation.      By &apos;dumping&apos; is understood the sale of goods in the markets of the United Kingdom at prices lower than those at which the goods are currently offered in the country of manufacture&quot;.The Council produced a report giving an outline of anti-dumping legislation and machinery; which outline was followedM3M0RANDUM. I.Anti-dumping legislation in this country.
with certain alterations in Part II of the Safeguarding of Industries Act, 1921.3. Part II of this Act contained two provisions -(a) for the imposition of a customs duty on goods sold in the United Kingdom ut prices below the &quot;cost of production&quot; as defined;   and(b) for the imposition of a customs duty on goods sold in the United Kingdom at prices which by reason of the depreciation ef the currency of the country of origin were below the price at which similar goods could be profitably manufactured in the United Kingdom.4. It was laid down in the Act that if on complaints madeto them it appeared to the Board of Trade that goods of any kind (except articles of food or drink) manufactured in a country outside the United Kingdom were being sold or offered for sale in the United Kingdom at prices below the cost ofproduction (or by reason of currency depreciation below theprice of profitable manufacture in this country), and that employment in this country was being or was likely to be seriously affected thereby, the Board might refer the matter to a committee for enquiry.&quot;Cost of production&quot; was defined in the Act as &quot;thecurrent sterling equivalent of 95 per cent, of(a) the wholesale price at the works charged for goods of the class or description for consumption in the country of manufacture.....or(b) if no such goods are sold wholesale forconsumption in the country of manufacture the price at the works ..... which would have been reasonable if the goods had been so sold, and in determining what price would have been reasonable regard shall be had to the wholesale prices charged for goods as near as may be similar&quot;.If the Committee reported that the conditions above-mentioned were fulfilled the Board of Trade might make an Order in respect of such goods manufactured in the country in question.     They then, under Section 3 of the Act, became liable to a customs duty of 33-^ per cent, ad valorem, subject to the remission of the duty in the case of any particular consignments which it was proved were sold at a
ftprice not less than the cost of production.      The Order was subject to approval by Resolution of the House of Commons.No order might, however, be made which was at variance with treaty obligutionst5. Duties on account of dumping arising from exchange depreciation were imposed on the following articles of German origin;Fabric gloves, glove fabric, domestic and illuminating glassware, domestic hollow-ware of aluminium or of enamelled wrought iron or steel, and gas mantles.The exchange depreciation provisions were enacted for a limited period only and expired in August 1984,6. There were very few applications for enquiry in respeot of dumping below &quot;cost of production&quot; - in all only nine, and of those only two reached the s tage of being referred to committees for enquiry.      These two were in respect of glass bottles manufactured in Holland and vulcanised fibre manufactured in the United States of America.      In their reports dated August, 1922, and October, 1922, respectively, the Committees stated that they did not consider that the applicants had proved that the goods in question were being sold in this country below the cost of production. Applications were also received in respect of thrown silk from Italy, microscopes from the United States of America, rubber tyres from the United States of America (all prior to December 1922),  split wood pulleys from Germany (August 1926), chrome upper leather from France (April 1927), gallic acid from Germany (May 1927), vegetable parchment from Germany, Belgium, France, and Italy (March 1928).      These applications were either rejected by the Board of Trade on the ground that a prima-facie case had not been established,  or not proceeded with.      In addition an enquiry was received in July, 1929, from the British electrical and Allied
Manufacturers&apos; Association, representing manufacturers of electricity meters, whether the Board were prepared to entertain further applications.      The enquirers were informed that it had &quot;been decided to take the first opportunity of repealing the powers of the Board, and further it was announced in November,  1989,  in the House of Commons that applications would not be entertained and that it would be directly opposed to the declared policy of the Government to maintain the. powers in force.     Accordingly the Section conferring - the power to impose a duty was repealed in the Finance Act,  1930,     There is thus no anti-dumping legislation in force in the United Kingdom at present.It will be observed that In nine years no anti-dumping duty of the kind in question was ever imposed.     Experience indicates that British manufacturers have had the greatest difficulty in securing the necessary evidence concerning the cost of production or wholesale price of goods in the country of origin.7. Question also arose whether the imposition of an anti-dumping duty would not be in conflict with Treaty obligationsu     The Law Officers of the Crown advised that the Treaty clauses,  which provide that the duty on goods the produce or manufacture of a particular country, must not exceed that on like articles the produce or manufacture of any other foreign country, did not preclude the imposition of a special anti-dumping duty on particular goods sold here at prices below the cost of production.     Their opinion was based upon the ground that the duty would not be imposed on the goods of the country concerned as such but only on such goods as might have been sold here on special conditions and that the duty could in fact have been avoided by any exporter who did not resort to dumping methods.      It is of course by no moans certain that this argument would have been accepted by
countries with which we have Treaties providing for most-favoured-nation treatment, and it would almost certainly have been objected to by Prance, with which country there is only a tacit understanding that most-favoured nation treatment will he granted.     On the other hand, as regards duties imposed on all the goods of a particular class from a particular foreign country, on the ground of depreciated exchange, the Law Officers advised that the Treaty clauses in question did not allow of the imposition of such duties. At the time when such duties were imposed upon certain goods from Germany, however, there was no treaty granting most-favoured-nation treatment to that country.II.ALLEGED INSTANCES OF DUMPING, The foTJoving particulars relating to various cases ofalleged dumping have come to the notice of the Board ofit-Trade :Iron and Steel.The National Federation of Iron and Steel Manufacturers in November last furnished a comparison of home and export prices of certain classes of steel in Great Britain and Belgium, France and Germany.     The figures indicated that while the export prices of certain British steel were slightly below the prices in the home market. Continental steel was sold for export at prices very substantially below home prices.The National Federation of Iron and Steel Manufacturers also furnished in the early part of this year information showing that United States steel wire was offered in February, c.i.,f. Glasgow, at prices much below the prices of the same wire at Pittsburgh.The Federation also reported in March 1931 that wire rods were quoted f,o.b,, Antwerp at  5.l2,6d, per ton, whereas bright wire drawn from the rods was only  5.0.0dc
per ton,  and Y/ire nails made from the wire  5.1.03. per ton. Elastic We hp j rig.The Board of Trade have recently been informed that the American elastic webbing manufacturers have agreed to send over to England all their surplus stock and throw-outs ofelastic webbings in order not to disturb the American home market.      It has been stated that the prices realised are below both the American and the British cost of production. Felt Hat Bodies,The British Felt Hat Manufacturers&apos; Federation in December 1930 represented to the Board of Trade that for some time past it has been a very common occurrence for Foreign hoods for felt hats to be placed for sale in this country at prices at which British manufacturers could not even buy the wool.     They stated also that the foreign manufacturers could not buy the wool more cheaply than the British manufacturers,As regards allegations of dumping of goods from Russia:, in the great majority of cases there is no information available either as to selling prices in Russia or as to costs of production.     A memorandum on imports from Russia has already been circulated to the Trade Survey Committee.An example of the sale for export by British manufacturers at prices lower than those charged by them in the home market is Sulphate of Ammonia.     Nearly all the British manufacturers of Sulphate of Ammonia are combined in the SuDphate of Ammonia Federation which arranges the sale of the product at home and abroad and divides up the proceeds (less administrative expenses) equally among the producers in proportion to their sales.     Sulphate of Ammonia is sold to the British farmer carriage paid at a fixed price wherever he may be,  the price in the Spring of the present year being  9,10.0d. for 6 ton lots,     The bulk (nearly I in 1929) of the output, however,  is exported, being sold at a lower price, the average declared
value f.o.b. of the sulphate of ammonia exported in the first five months of this year being only a trifle over  7 per ton.    This value no doubt includes a smaller cost of carriage, and may relate on the average to much larger parcels,  than the home price.III.ANTI-BUMPING PROVISIONS IN THE BRITISH EMPIRE AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES.(l) Existing anti-dumping provisions.     Specific anti-dumping provisions exist in the Customs and cognate legislation of five of the British Dominions (Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Union of South Africa and Newfoundland and some six foreign countries (United States, Japan, Turkey, Poland, Portugal and Cuba).    Particulars of these provisions are given in Appendix I attached to this note. In various other foreign countries the Government possess more or less general powers to protect native industry, which might in conceivable circumstances be used to combat dumping.For the purposes of this Note only the ordinary form of dumping is taken into consideration, i.e., the selling of goods for export at prices unduly low compared with home prices.    There are other forms of dumping duties in some of the dominions (e.g., &quot;freight&quot; dumping duty) which it seems unnecessary to take into consideration.(2) Anti-duuping provisions in practice. -   Although, as indicated above, 11 countries have specific anti-dumping provisions, action against dumping has, so far as our records show, only been taken in four Dominions (Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South Africa) and in one foreign country (United States).    Reports have come in from Japan, on occasions,  that the Government was considering action
under the anti-dumping provisions (e.g., in 1930 as regards soda ash and sulphate of ammonia),    but nothing has resulted.The following five paragraphs (3 to 7) give a summary-outline of the principal provisions of the legislation on the matter in those countries where anti-dumping provisions are or have been brought into operation (i.e., the four large Dominions and the United States).(3) Anti-dumping provisions in Australia. -   In briefest outline, the Australian provisions are as follows:-(a) &quot;Ordinary&quot; dumping duty is imposed if goods are sold to Australia at an export price less than a figure built up from the fair market value at the time of shipment.(b) &quot;Dumping below cost&quot; duty is imposed if goods are sold to Australia at an export price less than a &quot;reasonable&quot; price - the &quot;reasonable&quot; price being built up from the cost of production (which, in the absence of satisfactory information, can be fixed arbitrarily).(c) Dumping duty is levied on goods consigned forsale to Australia if they may be sold at less than a &quot;reasonable&quot; price.    The &quot;reasonable&quot; price is built up from the fair market value or, if evidence of such value is insufficient, from the costs of production, or,  if such costs are not ascertainable, from the costs of production estimated from such information as is available. (4) Anti-dumping provisions in New Zealand. - Under New Zealand legislation dumping duty may be levied if the actual selling price to New Zealand is less than the current domestic value or than a price based on cost of production. If dumping is suspected in the c ase of goods consigned to-IS-
New Zealand the authorities may &quot;determine the actual selling price, or the cost of production, or the current domestic value&quot;.(5) Anti-dumping provisions in Canada.     Ordinary-dumping duty is payable if the export or actual selling price to an importer in Canada is less than the fair market value or the value for Customs duty.    If dumping is suspected in the case of goods on consignment, the authorities are empowered to take such action as is necessary to ensure payment thereof.    (In some half dozen cases, such action has been taken in the form of requiring a deposit of 15fa ad valorem - the maximum amount of dumping duty then leviable -it being left to importers to claim refunds on production of proof that the prices actually realised did not justify the application of dumping duty).Under 19 30 legislation special provision was made for dumping duty on goods sold by manufacturers to subsidiaries in Canada below the duty-paid value plus various costs.(6) Anti-dumping -provisions in South Africa.  -&quot;Ordinary&quot; dumping duty is leviable when export price is less than .the domestic value plus various costs.    &quot;Sales&quot; dumping duty is leviable where goods are sold or offered for sale at a port in the Union at an amount less than the domestic value plus certain costs and duties.    No special provision to meet the case of goods on consignment can be traced.(7) United States anti-duiru/iruy provisions.  - Anti-dumping duties are leviable if the purchase price or exporters1&apos; sales price is less than the foreign market value or,  in the absence thereof,  the cost of production. As regards goods on consignment it may be noted (l)  that
the Consular invoice for such goods (if dutiable ad valorem) must give the price which the seller would have received, or is willing to receive, for sales in the country of export, and (2) that if dumping is suspeuted, appraisers may require affidavits promising that a sworn statement of detailed prioes as actually received will in due course be furnished.(8) Provisions common to all anti-dumping provisions -It will be observed that in all five countries where anti-dumping provisions have been brought into practical operation the liability to dumping duty is determined by a comparison of actual prioes with an amount which either is the home consumption value or the dutiable value or is built up with reference to such values.    In all five countries the Customs duties are mainly, or very largely, ad valoreia,  and under ordinary Customs legislation and procedure - quite apart from anti-dumping - there is machinery for obtaining and to some extemt checking particulars of home consumption values or other bases for dutiable value.    The American Consular invoice system and the system of exporters&apos;  declarations tc the Dominions, taken in conjuncticn with the activities of the American and Dominion representatives in exporting countries, and of appraisers in the countries of import,  designed to secure full information as to fair market values in the country of export (and in some countries even cost of production), must obviously facilitate action under anti-dumping provisions.      It might accordingly perhaps be said that the a dministration of the anti-dumping provisions is merely an extension of the general Customs and valuation practice of the countries in question.    Liability to dumping duty in the five countries can be more or less-14-
readily ascertained because of the availability of information as to the costs of goods in the countries of export, owing to the existence of machinery for obtaining such or similar information under the ordinary Customs practice.(9) Determination and notification as to liability;. to dumping duty. - In Canada the application of dumping duties is not dependent upon the publication of notifications specifying particular classes of goods as liable to the duty.    The duty is levied by the Customs, in cases where consignments of goods of any description, provided they are of a class or kind manufactured in Canada, are liable thereto in accordance with the legislative provisions, on the basis of the details set out in the invoices, which are required to show separately the actual sale price to the Canadian Importer and the fair market value for home consumption in the country of export.    In Australia and South Africa enquiry and report has to be made by a Government body, and a notice or proclamation has to be issued specifying the goods to which a liability to dumping duty attaches.      In New Zealand, under the rules issued under the anti-dumping provisions,  it is stated that the intention to impose a dumping duty must (except in special circumstances) be notified 3 months in advance.    In the United States, an anti-dumping &quot;finding&quot;,  specifying the liability of certain goods,  is issued by the Treasury Department after suoh enquiry as they consider necessary;   but appraisers suspecting dumping (before any finding is issued) may withhold the appraisement report.(10)    Extent of present anti-dumping duties.  -   No information can be traced as to the extent to which dumping duties authorised under the legislation of the five countries in question are at present applied, in praetioe, i.e., no particulars can be obtained of the Customs revenue
from such duties.    As indioated in the preceding paragraph the laibility of goods to dumping duty is,  in Canada, not notified.    In New Zealand   the only cases of dumping duty notifications now current are those issued in respect of pig iron from India (1927) and jam from South Africa (1930). as regards Australia, a list of goods &quot;gazetted&quot; under the provisions quoted in Appendix 1 is given in Appendix 2 -there are some 41 classes of good (from various countries) affected.    In South Africa some 7 classes of goods are at present liable to dumping duty (see Appendix 2);    and in the United States some 23 classes of goods have been the subject of anti-dumping &quot;findings&quot; which have (so far as our information goes) not been revoked (see Appendix 2). It does not necessarily follow from the fact that goods are notified as liable to dumping duty that a dumping duty is in fact levied on goods which are the subject of the notification:    the duty is,  of course,  only liable to be imposed if the price conditions of a particular consignment so warrants *It will be observed from the Statements in Appendix 2 that in a number of cases the notifications only app^y to goods of the particular class or description if imported from specified countries including the United Kingdom.

obstacles, viz., the obstacle of uncertainty.   With a known customs tariff it is always possible for the trader to look ahead with at least some measure of certainty and make plans accordingly.    Provided that duties remain substantially unaltered the obstacles to be encountered are known, and traders have an assurance that on paying their duties they can market their goods.    The system of licence is one in regard to which there can be no certainty, for the extent to which licences will be issued and the conditions on which they will be issued can never be exactly forecast and can be and are constantly varied.    Further, the system almost inevitably entails greater delays in procedure, applications for licences being held up eften for long periods, and it also unfortunately lends itself much more than do customs tariffs to corruption and to the adoption by those &quot;in the know&quot; of improper methods of securing early and favourable consideration of applications for licences. All honest traders have accordingly always agreed that even a high tariff barrier is far less of an impediment to trade development than that constituted by a prohibition system and it has been the constant aim of our policy to do all in our power to induce foreign countries to bring it to an end.31. When treaty negotiations were first undertaken with Germany there were still a large number of these objectionableIprohibitions in force in that country and it is in the Treaty with that country that the first serious effort was made to embody in a diplomatic instrument an agreement for the limitation of prohibitions.
