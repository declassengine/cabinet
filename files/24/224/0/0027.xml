9 9 further i-ii oS DOCUMENT IS THE, PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAKIvIC MAJESTY&apos; S OOVER1SMEHT.CABINETSECRET. COPY NO.     c.p..292(31).AGRICULTURAL POLICY.Kotes on the Minister of Agriculture&apos;s Memorandum CP. 87 (.31), by. the Secretary of State for Scotland,1.       I agree with the Minister of Agriculture that it is almost essential that a statement.of agricultural policy should be made on behalf of the Government before the House rises for the recess;    but while a declaration confined within the limits suggested by the Minister might or might not appease the farmers of England and Wales and their Parliamentary supporters, it would he greeted in Scotland with consternation. 2.       The grounds for this statement are :-(a) Wheat occupies only 3$ of the total arable acreage in Scotland.(b) Livestock and livestock products account for 80$ of the value of Scottish farm produce(o)     Therefore (i) a wheat Quota by itself would be of hardly any value to Scottish agriculture;(ii) Even if accompanied by a quota for malting barley the assistance given to agriculture in Scotland would he altogether incommensurate with that given to England and Wales.(iii) It was admitted when the Labour Government was in office that if the Wheat Quota was put into operation, Scotland should receive an equivalent and the sum of  100,000 per annum for every 5/- ofthe
ej pj jf* e* .&apos;j tSthe spread &quot;between the home and the world price of wheat was regarded as appropriate.3.     Before, however, the Cabinet comes to a decision on the quota the case against it which I have already put to the Minister of Agriculture should, receive consideration.   The policy of cereal quotas is :-(a) ill-designed to promote the true development of British farming along the lines of livestock and livestock products which command the highest prices in the home market without quota or subsidy, and is likely to retard its adaptation to modern economic conditions:(b) opposed to the whole trend of modern tendencies in agri-oultural production, for it was the unanimous conclusion of the representatives of 7/heat producing countries who met in London last summer that too much wheat is now being produced. Moreover scientific research and mechanization are constantly enabling wheat producers abroad to increase their production and lower its costs. Of course there will be fluctuations - overproduction one year will result in contraction and higher prices the next year; but there can be little doubt that the general tendency of the costs of production and therefore of prices will be to low levels:(c) certain to enable progressive farmers who practise mechanization to reap huge profits at the expense of the con-sumer while bolstering up cereal farming on land which could be used for other forms of farming which would be more profitable under modern conditions.    It is vain to trjr and return to the old system of farming which depended for its success upon an abundant supply of cheap labour. &apos; The British   cereal-farmerI    produces two or three times as much per acre as the Canadian, the American, the Argentine or the Australian but his salvation j   can only lie in producing more per man in which he is beaten by all those countries.     The only solution of the cereal farmer*sproblem is mechanization: (d) calculated/(2)
(d) calculated in the long run to decrease rather than to increase employment on the land because employment is best main-tained wherever the main system of farming is concerned with ani-[mal products, and because in so far as it stimulates economic development, the policy of quotas will prove to be a policy of tractors:(e) inconsistent with one of the- three dominant themes ofthe Government1s policy - the maintenance of the internal purchas-ing power of the pound.   The Minister of Agriculture calculates thatit will raise the cost of the 2 lb, loaf by *l2d.    twhich amounts toan increase in the cost of the 4 lb. loaf by a farthing:IT.B.Incidentally any further rise in the price of bread due either to profiteering by the millers or retailers or to the increase of other costs in the production and distribution of the loaf would be attributed to the adoption of the quota - to the discredit of the Government and to the prejudice of the case for a constructive effort for the restoration of agriculture.(t) flatly contrary to the recommendation of the economic advisory Council (Committee on Agricultural Poliay) whioh reported as follows:wWg are convinced that permanent Government assistanoe in the form of guaranteed prices or acreage^subsidies, ufaich would make it easier to continue obsolete methods should not be given.   Any assistance accorded should be gireoted to furthering the adoption of improved methods of production and distribution&quot;.4.     Against these disadvantages it will be urged that the scheme lias two practical advantages:-(a) That it is ready to put into immediate operation.(b) That the farmers want it because wheat is a convenient crop in some rotations in the following respects:-(i)   It is autumn sown, (ii)    It suits heavy land, (iii)    It provides straw which   is useful for many purpoees other than fodder and litter.(si-    .
O o o&amp; i:l o(iv) It involves none of the complex and difficult problems, genetic, dietotic, veterinary, etc. which have to be solved in the production and management of livestock.But the Minister&apos;s calculation is baaed upon a guaranteed price of 15/- a quarter above the world price -i.c.  about 45/- a quarter.     As the demand of the Agricultural Conference assembled by the Labour Government in 1930 was for 55/- a quarter and the Scottish farmers! have impressed upon me that nothing short of 50/- would &quot;be satisfactory, it is at least doubtful whether 45/- would satisfy the Govern-mentts agricultural supporters.5.     To discuss in detail long range agricultural policy would be out of place at this stage but it may be urged that any immediate steps taken should be in a forward and not a backward direction, should encourage tho erderly and profit-able development of British agriculture in such a way as to make the best economic u*e of tho natural advantages of Great Britain and should therefore be related te the need of dirocting the energies of the British farmer &quot;to the live-stock industry and to aim at meeting the demands of the population for meat and milk&quot;.      (See the &quot;White Paper fin Agricultural Policy issued by tho Conservative Government in 1926) .6.     The first ateps in such a policy would be:-(a) A vigorous campaign against bovine tuberculosin and contagious abortion of which the objectives would be (l) To make the milk supply of the people safe, (ii) To prolong the average milking life of the cow by something over 5Gfo, thus substantially lowering the costs of milk production,
(iii) By ensuring ample supplies of safe and cheap milk to justify the launching of a &quot;Drink more Milk&quot; campaign.N.B. The consumption of milk per head in this country is pint, in the U.S.A. 1 pint, in Sweden 1-^ pints.(iv) By lowering the costs of production &quot;to simplifyenormously the problem of disposing of the surplus partly by cheese making end partly by opening up the prospect of enabling the processing of milk to be undertaken in thiscountry on an economic basis,3ST.B. It is suggested in the memorandum of the Minister of Agriculture that the difficultiesof Scottish farmers are partly due to the overproduction of milk.     Yet if ths Scottish people were zo drink as much milk per head as the Swedes ,  it. is doubtful whether there is enough land in Scotland (under the present system of farming) to maintain the cows necessary to produce the milk.     The main obstacle to the expansion and exploitation of this market is bovine tuberculosis.(b) The organisation of bacon production and manufacture.The consumption of pig products in this country amountsto about  80,000,000 in value of which about  55,000,000is imported.7.     If, however, the Cabinet decide in favour of the Wheat Q,quota something more must obviously be done for Scotland than a vague undertaking &quot;to deal with barley as well as wheat, if not concurrently then as soon as a pract-impracticable scheme can be devised and if not by quota then in some other way&quot;.A Bpread of 15/- a quarter between the world and the guaranteed price would be roughly equivalent to a sub-sidy of M-rOOO-rOGO to the English farmer and of only  800,000 to the Scottish farmer.     The principle of equal treatment as between England and Scotland in agricultural policy has been accepted by successive Coalition, conservative and Labour Governments.    Consequently if the wheat Quota is adopted/
adopted it will be necessary to declare at the same time:-(a) That a Committee has been appointed with in-structions from the Cabinet to work out a scheme for a quotnfor malting barley.N.B.   A quota for barley would be free from some of the objections which can be urged against the wheat quota (e.g. it would not effect the price of any staple food) and the additional offals will be helpful to pig production.     But although the advantage to be derived by Scottish farmers from a barley quota would be more than double the advantage from the wheat quota, the advantage to the English and Y/elsh farmers would be still greater.(b) That a campaign will be launched forthwith in Scotland against bovine tuberculosis and contagious abortion. The cost of such a campaign in Scotland would be relatively 3tnall and should not exceed j:20,000 a year.     Moreover there are positive advantages in localising the campaign to start with;    even inside Scotland we should probably proceed district by district, and valuable experience would be gained for a nation-wide campaign when funds are available.(o) That a pig testing station will be erected in Scotland at a cost of  3,000 and that active steps will be taken under the Marketing Act to organise the production and manufacture of pig products - cost in Scotland perhaps  2,000 a year.(d) To prohibit the sale of oat products from abroad except in marked containers.8.     Other proposals which could be reserved for further examination a3 part of the Scottish equivalent of the Wheat quota would be : -(a) The compulsory grading of beef - at a commencing cost of  12,000 a year - with provision for its gradual assump-tion by the industry.(b) The dissemination by advertisement and propagandaof the results of recent research in regard to the feeding and/management
cyO O imanagement of beef cattle at a cost of  1,500 a year.(c) Co-operative slaughtering at suitable centres of fat sheep and lambs on the New Zealand plan -a loan of  20,000 would be required for the first slaughter house.(d) Disease in hill flocks of sheep is now costing the country enormous sums of money.     Progress ia being made but could be rapidly increased by further investigation and demonstration at a cost of  5,000 a year.(e) The prohibition of the import of earlypotatoes.(f) The prohibition of the dumping of foreign fruit pulp.(gj The prevent ion,   as part of a campaign for the cheapening and expansion of milk produced at home,of 1te importation of milk products produced under worse conditions than those permitted in our own dairy farms.9.     Such a policy as is outlined in the two proceding paragraphs would fall far short of that put forward by my predecessor in its demands upon the   Exchequer, nor would it represent an equivalent in direct advantage to the Scottish farmer of the wheat quota subsidy to the English farmer. The importance of agriculture and especially live-stock farming in the national economy of Scotland, is so great that Scotland would rightly complain if no progress were made on these lines and if action in connection with barley and milk did not proceed simultaneously with action on the ^at ^quota.(Intld.;    A.H.M.S.Scottish Office,24th November, 1931.
