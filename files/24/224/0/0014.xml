SECTION I__INTRODUCTORY.Joint Secretaries to the Committee.(a.) Composition and Terms of Reference.1. At their Third Meeting (B.A.C., 3rd Meeting, Conclusion 7), the Economic Advisory Council agreed to appoint a Committee with the following terms of reference: To consider generally what is likely to happen under a oon-tinuanoe of the existing policy for agriculture, and, in particular, to consider the following questions: (a) Mill the decline continue in production from the land andin employment on the land ?(b) Is such a decline consistent with national economy ofnational safety ?2.   The Committee is constituted as follows :-Mr. E. D. Simon, M.P. (Chairman). Sir Alan Anderson, K.B.E. Mr. John Beard.Mr. W. C. D. Dampier-Whetham, F.B.S.Mr. E. R. Debenham.Sir Daniel Hall, K.C.B., F.R.S.Sir Matthew Wallace, Bart.Dr. R. H. Tawney.Mr. A. F. Hemming, C.B.E., Assistant Secretary, Economic Advisory CouncilMr. R. R. Enfield, Ministry of Agriculture and fisheries in addition, we have had the benefit of the services of Mr. H. D. Henderson of the Economic Advisory Council.(b.) Arrangement of Report.3. At our first meeting, we thought it convenient, for the purpose of our Report, to re-state as follows what we understand to be the questions set to us by the Economic Advisory Council: (a) How far, and in what respect, has agricultural output andemployment declined in recent years ?(b) How far is any such decline likely to continue under the exist-ing policy for agriculture, and how far is it likely that out-put and employment could be increased by better farming methods ?(o) Is this prospective decline sufficiently serious to justify the Government in applying remedies which would under ordinary circumstances be regarded as uneconomic and undesirable ?4. In preparing our Report, we have dealt with the problem in the order indicated in the foregoing questions, Section II being devoted to a discussion of the changes in the volume of agricultural production in Great Britain between 1908 and 1925, those being the years in respect of which data regarding the output of all kinds of agricultural produce are available. In Section III, we indicate the changes that have taken place in the volume of agricultural employment between the census years 1911 and 1921, and also the modifications of wages conditions since 1911. In Section. IV, we describe the situation with which the various branches of [21261] b report.
agriculture are faced to-day and indicate what, in our view, are the causes which have led up to the present position. In the following Section (Section V), we &quot;draw a comparison between the position of agriculture in this country and that of other unsheltered industries. At this point also we consider the effect of imports on the foreign exchanges. In Section VI, we endeavour to appraise the national importance of agriculture. Section VII is devoted to an examination of the extent to which the position of British agriculture can be improved by normal methods. In particular, we discuss the value of reforms in marketing and improvements in farming technique. In Section VIII, we give our answer to the question : &quot;Is there a case for subsidies or other abnormal methods of help to agriculture?&quot; Our principal conclusions are summarised in Section IX.5. We desire to place on record the great assistance we have received from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and from the Department of Agriculture for Scotland, both of which have furnished us, often at very short notice, with valuable information on the large number of points covered by our enquiry. The Ministry of Health was also good enough to furnish us with memoranda summarising such information as is available regarding the relative health of rural and urban populations in this country.II.-CHANGES IN THE VOLUME OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION AND ACREAGE IN GREAT BRITAIN BETWEEN 1908 AND 1925.(a.) Changes in Gross Output.6. Most of the available statistical information relating to the changes in agricultural output refers to the years 1908 and 1925, which are the only years in which detailed inquiries have been carried out in regard to the output of all kinds of agricultural produce. These inquiries were made in connection with the Census of Production Act, 1906, and afford the best basis for the comparison of the volume of agricultural output between the pre-war and post-war periods. In addition, the annual returns collected by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Board of Agriculture for Scotland afford means of making an estimate of the changes which have taken place since 1925. Exhaustive statistics regarding these changes have been published by the two Departments, and we therefore only propose to call attention to the outstanding alterations which have taken place since the first census in 1908. The following table (Table 1) gives the estimated gross value of output of farms in Great Britain in 1908 and 1925 respectively.Table 1.

If this table is corrected for changes which have taken place inprices, the results shown in the following table (Table 2) are obtained. These indicate the changes in the volume of gross output in these years. The figures omit market garden and glasshouse production, for which comparable figures are not available.Table 2. 	1908 (at 1925 Prices).	1925.

The figures show, however, certain material changes, the more important of which are a decrease of live-stock and farm crops and an increase of dairy produce and poultry and eggs.The increase in dairy produce is mainly attributed to the rise in sales of liquid milk off farms, the production of butter and cheese on farms having slightly fallen.The changes in the value of the gross output of Great Britain since the second census year (1925) is given in the following table (Table 3) :-Table 8. Estimated Gross Value of Output of Farms in Great Britain in each of the Agricultural Years,* 1924-25 to 1928-29.(Thousand  .)	1924-25.	1925-26.	1926-27.	1927-2S.	1928-29.1Live-stock.........

The decline in the value of the gross output shown in this Table appears to be due to the fall in. prices and not to a decline in the total volume of production. There appears to have been during this period an increase in the actual output of live-stock from the farms, though this has resulted in a reduction in the numbers kept on the farms. The total production of milk in England and Wales has shown comparatively small changes over the period, as indicated in the following estimates:- Millions of Gallons. 1924-25     ............      1,1171925-26 1926-27 1927-28 1928-291,186 1,152 1,147 1,181The production in Scotland is practically unchanged.(b.) Changes in Net Output.8. In the &quot; Agricultural Output and the Food Supplies of Great Britain,&quot; referred to in paragraph 6 above, an attempt was made to estimate the changes in the net agricultural output between the pre-war and post-war periods. The calculations inevitably involve certain statistical difficulties due partly to the fact that some of the necessary information was derived from the Industrial Census, and that the period covered by the Industrial Census (1907) does not coincide with the period of the Agricultural Census (1908), and partly to the question of alterations in traders&apos; stocks. For such reasons that report included a comparison of the pre-war period with figures of the net output of agriculture based on an average of four post-war seasons. The results are given in the following table (Table 4) : Table 4. 	About 1908.	Average of 1924-25 to 1927-28.

These figures, in effect, make a comparison between pre-war and post-war years, firstly of the total sum received by farmers for the sale off the farms of farm produce, and secondly of the total sum expended by farmers in the purchase of certain materials (mainly feeding stuffs and fertilisers). The fact that stands out from these figures is that in spite of high wages and low prices relative to 1908, British farmers have, in the aggregate, maintained the volume of production.(o.) Changes in Acreage.10. The following table (Table 5) gives the changes in acreage in Great Britain for the years 1908, 1918, 1925 and 1929 :-

The rise in the area of the arable land between 1908 and 1918 and the corresponding rises in the areas under wheat, barley and oats were, in a large measure, due to the ploughing-up campaign, associated with the Food Production Department, during the War. After the War, the decline in the arable acreage which had been in progress for nearly 50 years once more set in, and by 1924 the arable acreage in England and Wales had fallen to the 1914 figure. Since that date, approximately another million acres in England and Wales have been lost to the plough.12. In Scotland, the arable area had fallen to the 1914 level in 1923, and since then almost another 200,000 acres have been lost, but the increase of the arable area during the War was much less than in England and Wales.13. The feature of Table 5 is the rise in the area of arable land of over 1,000,000 acres between 1908 and 1918, followed by a falling away of nearly 3,000,000 acres in the last eleven years.III.-CHANGES  IN  EMPLOYMENT AND  WAGES  CONDI-TIONS BETWEEN 1911 AND 1921.(a.)  Changes in the Volume of Employment.14. The number of persons engaged in agriculture in Great Britain has shown a downward tendency for more than 50 years, This is the result partly of improved methods of cultivation and the greater use of farm machinery, and partly of the laying down of arable land to grass. We do not propose here to draw conclusions-sions, but only to record facts. No exact estimate is available regarding the effect on employment of laying down arable land to grass. According to a statement furnished by the Ministry of Agriculture arid Fisheries, the figures for the 1925 Census show that the total number of workers employed per thousand acres on holdings mainly arable (i.e., consisting of at least 70 per cent, of arable land) was 86-6 against 28-1 on holdings mainly pasture.15. In 1928, the number of workers employed per thousand acres was estimated in a paper submitted to the Agricultural Tribunal of Investigation by Sir Thomas Middleton as 16 on grass land and 55 on arable land. The numbers employed on arable land, however, depend upon the crops which are grown, and it has been
estimated that potatoes employ about 3j times and roots about 2J times the amount of manual labour required for corn. We have received from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries a rough estimate which suggests that the kind of conversion which has been taking place in recent years of good land (capable of growing roots and potatoes) from arable to grass, means, for every thousand acres converted, the reduction of employment of between 10 and 40 workers, the number depending mainly on whether the arable land was previously under corn or roots. From the evidence given above, it appears fair to conclude that since 1920 the main reduction of arable land has been in that devoted to corn growing, and that the figure for the loss of employment due to the conversion of 1,000 acres of corn land to grass may be put at 20 workers, on the methods of arable cultivation employed in this country. The following table (Table 6) gives the changes in the total number of persons employed in agriculture in England and Wales between 1871 and 1921, based on the decennial population census. The figure for 1929 has been computed from the annual returns of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.Table 6. 	Men.	Women.1871       .........	1,240,565	82,4621881	1,128,355	60,9601891       .........	1,043,967	45,8421901        .........	923,644	33,5501911       .........	971,70S	33,2721921       .........	907,941	51,9641929*      .........	841,000	46,00016. The corresponding figures for Scotland are shown in the following table : Table 7. 	j        Men. -   i	Women.1871        .....	...!       178,200	1881       .....	...!       109,900	1S91	...        163,324	1901       .....	...        151,214	40,0341911        .....	...!       148,425	32,4231921        .....	...        140,248	22.23S19291      .....	13S.000	19,00017. Since 1921, the annual returns of the Ministry of Agriculture, which are calculated on a different basis, show a reduction of approxi-mately 99,000 workers. In Scotland, the number of regular workers has remained approximately unchanged while the number of casual workers has fallen by approximately 9,000.18. No machinery exists for ascertaining accurately the amount of unemployment in agriculture. In the past, it has undoubtedly been small, but during last winter there were indica-tions of exceptional unemployment in certain districts. A special inquiry carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture in February 1930 showed several instances of exceptional unemployment in the Eastern and South-Eastern portion of the country. The rest of England and Wales was apparently unaffected. For the whole country, the reports received by the Ministry showed a total of Between 30,000 and 40,000 unemployed.* These figures imply that agricultural unemployment in February 1930 amounted to about 3 per cent, of the total number employed in the industry, Dut in certain districts the proportion was stated to be about 10 per cent., and, in one, as high as 20 per cent.1 Much of the information was, however, incomplete, and unsuitable as a basis of a statistical estimate.* Computed from the annual returns collected by the Ministry of Agricul-ture and Fisheries, which show decreases between 1921 and 1929 of 10&quot; 1 per cent, in men employed and 19 per cent, in women.j Computed from the annual returns collected by the Department of Agriculture for Scotland which show decreases of 2&apos;2 per cent, in men and 20- 5 per cent, in women.
y(b.) Changes in Wages Conditions.19. Agricultural wages in England and Wales since the War have been subject to rates fixed under statutory powers in two periods, firstly, during the currency of the Corn Production Acts, and, secondly, under the Agricultural Wages (Regulation) Act, 1924. The first period covered July 1918 to September 1921. It was followed, after the repeal of the Corn Production Acts, by the establishment of Conciliation Committees,* which were in operation during the years 1922 to 1924.20. The following table (Table 8) gives changes in the average weekly wages which prevailed during the - War and the post-War period. During the period of the Conciliation Committees, when no minimum rates were in force, the figures given are those which are believed to have been the average obtaining throughout the country in each year : Table 8.

The Agricultural Wages (Regulation) Act, 1924, was not extended to Scotland, and figures comparable with the above are therefore not available in regard to Scottish wages.22. The last column of the above table indicates the percentage increase in weekly wages as compared with 1914. Under the Act, however, the number of hours per week which the Wages Com-mittees have specified in relation to the minimum rates of wages constitute a shorter working -week than before the War. Labour in excess of the week thus specified has to be paid for at overtime rates. The increase shown in the table gives the increase in weekly earnings on the basis of these shorter hours. No statistics based on official returns are available showing the increased cost to the farmer of employing hired labour upon his farm per hour, after making allowances for the reduction in the number of hours per week and the rates fixed for overtime. Certain rough estimates of this figure have, however, been made, and we have had before us a copy of a table published by the National Farmers&apos; Union, showing that the present cost of labour to the farmer is between 105 and 110 per cent, above that of pre-War. Other calculations made at the Universities and elsewhere appear to corroborate the view that the money&apos; wages of hired labour reckoned on an hourly basis have been approximately doubled since the pre-War period!* These committees were voluntary negotiating bodies for the purpose of agreeing standard rates of wages for their areas. They were entitled to submit their agreement to the Ministry of Agriculture for registration, the effect of which was that the agreed rate became enforceable as a civil liability on all employers in the area. Actually, such agreements wore registered only in a trifling proportion of the cases.-j&quot; If methods had not changed, the labour cost of an operation such as ploughing an acre of land would also have doubled ; but, in practice, farmors have been able to effect economies in the use of manual labour in cortain operations.[21261] o
IY__THE PRESENT SITUATION AND ITS CAUSES.(a.) The Present Situation.(i.) The Geographical Distribution of the present Depression.28. Notwithstanding the maintenance of the general level of production shown in the statistics to which we have already referred, there can be no doubt whatever that agriculture has been passing through an exceedingly difficult time. The depression* may be said to have begun in the autumn of 1920 and to have con-tinued, with minor ups and downs, ever since. It has, however, been much more severe in the branches of farming that derive their income principally from corn growing and to-day the most serious situation is mainly in the arable districts.24. As regards the position of agriculture in England and Wales, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries have furnished us with information based upon two sets of inquiries made in 1927 and 1929 respectively. Detailed reports were prepared for every district of the country by the Ministry&apos;s District Commissioners. On the basis of these reports, the Ministry divided up the country into five classes, giving a rough general picture of the state of farm-ing throughout England and Wales, and estimated approximately the proportion of the country which could be grouped in each class. The result for the year 1927 was as follows :  		Proportion of the Agricultural Area.1.	Farming on the whole satisfactory ...	Nearly half.2.	Farming fairly satisfactory	Nearly one-fifth.3.	Slight losses being made   ...	,,    one-fifth.4.	Farming unsatisfactory	,,    one-tenth.5.	Farming conditions bad	Approximately one-tenth.25. On revision in 1929 of the whole set of inquiries, it was concluded that class (1) should be slightly increased, class (2) slightly decreased; the remainder showed little change.26. The geographical distribution in England and Wales of these five classes in 1927 was as follows: (1) and (2). Areas where farming conditions were on the whole satisfactory or fairly satisfactory.North of a line from the Humber to the Mersey and west of a line from the Mersey to Portland Bill, with the exception of the Yorkshire Wolds and Pembroke.The Fen districts of the following counties: Lincoln, Isle of Ely, Cambridge and Huntingdon.In Derbyshire and the dairying districts of Berkshire and Buckingham conditions were also fairly satisfactory.(8) Districts where slight losses were made.Practically the whole of the South Midlands, including the grazing areas of Leicester, Warwick and Northampton, together with South Staffordshire, Hereford, Worcester and part of Gloucester were included in this category. Other areas falling in this group were Pembroke, Hertford, East Dorset, East Sussex, Surrey and North Kent.(4) Districts where farming was unsatisfactory.These areas consisted mainly of comparatively small patches, i.e.: the Wolds of Yorkshire and Lincoln, North Staffordshire, South Warwick, North Buckinghamshire, Bedford, West Huntingdon, Middlesex, North and West Essex, South Kent, East Sussex and the Salisbury Plain district of Wiltshire.* &quot;We use the word &quot; depression &quot; in the sense it is commonly employed in this connection, viz.. in relation to the profits earned by farmers. The agricultural labourer has probably never been less dopressed than now, owing to the increase in wages ; but he risks losing his employment if the depression continues.
(5) Districts where farming conditions were bad.The areas falling into this category were the thin arable lands in Hampshire, Berkshire and Oxford. Conditions were bad in practically the whole of Norfolk and Suffolk and the southern part of Cambridge.   A further bad area was thesouth-eastern part of Essex, with the exception of a small region round Southend.27. In 1929, the position in the north and west of the country appeared to have improved in comparison with 1927, with the exception of the Yorkshire Wolds where, largely owing to difficulties of conversion from arable to pasture, the position had become worse. A decline had taken place in north and west Essex, thus making practically the whole of that county a &quot;bad&quot; area. There had also been some decline in Bedford, Hertford and Huntingdon. Little or no change had taken place in the remainder of the country.28.   An independent estimate of the area and distribution ofagricultural depression was made in 1928-29 by Mr. Dampier-Whetham,* in conjunction with the University Department of Agri-culture at. Cambridge, which, broadly speaking, agrees with the above. He has, however, paid special attention to soil types and his general conclusions as to the localisation of depression are as follows: &quot;To begin with East Anglia, the heaviest land is the London clay in Essex, covering 180,000 acres. Similar soils from the agricultural point of view are the gault in the counties of Cambridge and Bedford, the Oxford clay in Huntingdon, Bedford, Cambridge, and Lincoln, and the lias in Lincoln. These lands are all difficult to drain, they need a maximum amount of labour, and a bare fallow is generally necessary every three or four years to keep them in good condition. Because of this last fact, and because clay requires time to recover from rain, much unremunerative work has to be expended on these soils. Their total area is about 415,000 acres, and this figure represents the extent of the worst conditions, where some land has already gone out of cultivation, the area over which agriculture may be called &apos; very depressed.&apos;The boulder clay is easier to work, and some of it grows excellent crops. The heavier types of this soil cover about 890,000 acres in Essex and Suffolk, and perhaps about one-quarter of this say 100,000 acres for special reasons may be more difficult to cultivate than the rest.The sandy &apos; breck&apos; lands of Norfolk and Suffolk occupy 170,000 acres, and the light chalk soils another 322,000 acres, or 492,000 together. Over this area, as we have seen, conditions vary, but we must classify most of it as &apos; depressed,&apos; meaning thereby on or below the margin between profit and loss.On good loams, over gravel or the lighter boulder-clay subsoils, arable farmers are more prosperous, while from the rich fenlands profits can almost always be made. But on heavy clay &apos; breck &apos; land and chalk, the depression is real and, over most of the area, severe. It appears then that in the East Anglian province, containing in all rather over 5,000,000 acres, agriculture is depressed on perhaps 1,000,000 acres, or approximately one-fifth of the whole region.The light chalk lands which stretch across the South of England into Wiltshire and Dorset resemble those of East Anglia, and cover a total area of about 1,400,000 acres. But the tops of the hills are mostly downland, and the valleys are often well watered grass; usually only the slopes of the hills are ploughed. We may perhaps estimate their area as about one-third of the whole, or 450,000 acres. Probably most of this light arable land, or say 400,000 acres, is suffering economically, though, owing to the kinder climate and the admixture of grass, less severely than East Anglia. Another 200,000 acres should perhaps be added for the oolite beds which form the arable farms of the Cotswolds.* See the &quot; Times,&quot; February 18th and 19th, 1929. [21261] o 2
Further inquiry may disclose other areas which should be included; but, on these facts, we get a rough estimate of the depressed area as somewhere about 1,600,000 acres of the 26,000,000 acres under crops and grass in England and Wales, or perhaps 1,000,000 acres out of a total of about 10,000,000 acres of arable land.&quot;(ii.) Distribution of the Present Depression by Farming Types.29. The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries submitted a further classification based on farming types, which may be summarised for the year 1929 as follows : (a) Mixed Farming.This type is general over the whole country, but predominantly-nates in the eastern half of England. With the significant exception of East Anglia and a few small districts, farming conditions were fairly satisfactory in 1927. There was a decided improvement between 1927 and 1929 in the extreme north and the extreme west (Cornwall and Devon), in both of which counties grassland predominates. Throughout the whole area covered by this type, the difference between satisfactory and unsatisfactory conditions turned very largely on the relative preponderance of arable land. Wherever possible it was found that the arable area was being reduced, and milk production being increasingly adopted. In East Anglia condi-tions were bad. The general reductions of rents on the heaviest lands were bringing them below pre-war levels. Despite this, arrears of rent were reported to be increasing heavily, more land was being given up, and the area remaining unlettable was increasing rapidly.(b) Dairy Farming.The areas classed under this heading include South Cheshire and the Wirral, Central Staffordshire, parts of Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, Buckinghamshire, and an extensive area in the west of England comprising most of Somerset and parts of Wiltshire, Gloucestershire, Devon and Dorset. At a rough estimate, 75 to 80 per cent, of the land in these districts is under grass. Farming conditions generally were not unsatisfactory in 1927, and improved between 1927 and 1929. Bents were maintained in advance of pre-war figures. Farms were re-let readily, and the relative prosperity was attracting applications from less favoured areas.(c) Upland Farming.This category covers (1) sheep and cattle breeding and rearing on moorland, downland and hill pastures. (2) Sheep and barley farming, which includes, on the one hand, mountain and hill country in Wales and the north of England, the Peak, Cotswolds, Yorkshire Dales, &amp;c, and, on the other hand, the Yorkshire and Lincolnshire Wolds, and thin arable area on the chalk belt extending from Wiltshire and Hampshire to Norfolk. The depressed section in this group is mainly the sheep and barley farms and thin arable land on the chalk. The rest was satisfactory.(d) Market Gardening.This includes fruit and hop growing, and also dairying and industrial areas. The position of farmers was not unsatisfactory in 1927, and there appeared to be little change in 1929.80. In reviewing, in April 1980, the situation set out in the above paragraphs, the Ministry of Agriculture conclude that the grading of the various areas remains substantially the same as in 1929.   Improvement in the general conditions was reported in
ISPembroke, Warwick and Leicestershire. The position was worse in- (1) The arable areas of East Anglia.(2) The potato districts of Lincoln, the Pens,  South-WestLancashire and part of Yorkshire. (8) The market-garden area of Bedfordshire and, to a lesser extent, Worcester. (4) The hop growing district of Kent and Hereford.(iii.) The position as to Rents.81. No information was officially collected as to the average rent of agricultural land in England and Wales prior to the census of 1925, and therefore there is no official basis upon which the average rents in that year can be compared with pre-war years. It is, how-ever, known that the rise in rents during and immediately after the War was very much less than the rise in the level of prices. Some rise, however, undoubtedly did take place, and in certain estates covering 43,000 acres in various parts of England and Wales amounted in 1922 to approximately 25 per cent. By 1929, this had fallen to about 10 per cent.32. The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries have submitted certain particulars regarding rents for the years 1927 and 1929 in England and Wales. The conclusion reached in 1927 was that there had been at that time no reduction of rents, such as would bring the average back to the pre-war level. Only in the eases mentioned below had abatements become at all general. Throughout four-fifths of the country where farming conditions were not unsatisfactory, the situation in 1929 was substantially the same as two years earlier, and only in exceptional cases were abatements of rent asked for or conceded.33. In the unsatisfactory areas there was a pronounced ten-dency in 1929 towards the granting of continuing abatements and reductions of rent in the case of farms which are unattractive by reason of their large size. The general movement was most evident in the Yorkshire Wolds, in East Anglia, and on the thin arable land overlying the chalk in the southern countries as far west as East Dorset. On the clay lands of Essex, abatements of 10 to 25 per cent, had become general. The rents of the better-class farms were back to pre-war level, while those of holdings over 200 acres in the poorer districts had fallen 15 to 25 per cent, below pre-war figures, farms were let at reduced rent, or even rent-free the first year. Arrears of rent were found to be increasing in Essex and Norfolk. On estates, investigated in the latter country, with a rental of  320,000, arrears had increased from 4 per cent, in 1927 to 6 per cent, in 1929.34. Owing to the fact that the rise in the cost of upkeep upon agricultural land has been substantially greater than the rise of rents, the net return to landlords has fallen considerably below its pre-war level. *85. In effect, the landowners have borne a share of the burden of agricultural depression, and the low returns now received mean that few large improvements, such as drainage schemes, can be carried out, while the difficulties of carrying out the ordinary work of maintenance and repair are clearly increased.36. If the farmers, particularly in the depressed areas, were to receive any material relief in the further reduction of rents, we fear that such a reduction of rents would almost inevitably lead to a decline in equipment and to the gradual decay of many agricultural estates. Indeed, in some areas, this has happened.* This matter is dealt with in a presidential address delivered by Mr. W. O. D. Dampier-Whetham before the Agricultural Economics Society in June 1930.
(iv.) Conclusions. 37.   From the evidence submitted on this part of our inquiry we oonclude that (a) Apart from the general fall in prices, from which agriculturehas suffered in common with other industries, serious agri-cultural depression to-day only affects part of the country and some branches of farming. More than half the country is in a satisfactory or fairly satisfactory condition, and the area in which there is severe depression amounts to about one-tenth of the whole.(b) Broadly speaking, conditions on the farms have been, generally,worse the higher the proportion of income derived from the sale of cereals. The value of the total cereals: sold off farms in Great Britain amounts to 9* per cent., and wheat to 4* per cent, of the total agricultural output. Conditions are particularly bad on farms situated in East Anglia on heavy clay or on infertile light land, which will not grow &apos;good permanent grass.(b.) The Causes of the Present Situation.38. To analyse the causes which have brought about the present agricultural depression, it is necessary not merely to look at the situation as it is to-day, but to consider the influences which have been at work during the last decade. As a first step in this analysis, it is necessary to distinguish between the general influences which have affected the farming industry in this country as a whole and the particular influences which have affected certain branches or certain products. We have no hesitation in concluding that the outstanding general cause of the difficulties which have confronted agriculture in Great Britain and many other countries during the past ten year has been the fall in prices without a corresponding fall in costs.39. When we come to investigate this fall in prices, a further distinction is necessary, namely, between those causes which lead to a change in the general level of agricultural prices taken together, and those which lead to changes in the prices of individual products taken separately. Historically, it is the fluctuation in agricultural prices as a whole which has been of the greatest importance, and has had the most far-reaching consequences, for price changes of individual commodities which are not part of a general change tend to neutralise one another, and they are, therefore, less injurious to the farmer. It is no new fact in agricultural experience that the industry should be feeling the consequences of a general price movement. Indeed, in so far as adequate statistical data are available, it would be more true to say that agriculture has hardly ever been in any other position. The long-period changes in fortunes of British farming  from prosperity to depression, and again from depression to prosperity have been more intimately connected with changes in the general level of commodity prices than with any other single cause. Since the Napoleonic wars, these alternating periods (each of which include minor fluctuations) are roughly as follows : 1815-1850 ...1850-1872 ...1872-1896 ...1896-1914 ...1914-1920 ...1920-1930 ...... Prices falling ... ...      ,,     rising ......J     ,,    falling.........     ,,    rising slowly ...,, ,, rapidly... ...!     ,,    falling......Agricultural depression. ,, prosperity.,, depression.,, recovery.,, prosperity.,, depression.Those periods are familiar to economic students and these changes between prosperity and depression correspond to those experienced by other industries.40. The last decade has been a period of falling commodity prices, and agricultural prices have shared in the general movement. How closely they have done so is shown in the following table (Table 9), which compares the changes in the index of agricultural prices with the changes in the index of general commodity prices.* These figures are exclusive of sales by one farmer to another.
Table 9.

The close harmony between the movement of agricultural prices on the one hand, and general commodity prices on the other, justifies the conclusion indicated above that the fall in the former is due to a cause which has affected agricultural prices, in common with the prices of other commodities, rather than to causes specifically associated with the supply and demand of agricultural produce. We do not propose to discuss to what extent the fall in prices shown in this table may be due to monetary causes.(c.) The agricultural consequences of a general fall in prices.42. The next step, therefore, in the diagnosis of the present situation, is to examine the agricultural consequences of a general fall in prices.43. In agriculture, there is a longer time-lag than in most other industries. A fall in the price level brings about a disparity between the costs of production and prices. It does so, broadly speaking, in two ways. One is due to the time-lag,t and the other to the effect on the relation between the fixed charges in agriculture and the prices of agricultural produce.44. As regards the former, in agriculture as in certain other industries, a considerable period of time elapses between the expenditure on production costs and the receipts of the proceeds of sale of farm produce. In effect, the farmer buys his requi-sites at one price level, and sells his produce at another. If the general price level has fallen in the meantime, he makes an unexpected loss; if it has risen, he makes an unexpected profit. When prices fall very fast as they did between the middle of 1920 and the end of 1921, this loss is of great importance. Moreover, the downward movement of the prices of certain farm requisites and of their costs of production tends to lag behind the downward movement of produce prices, thus increasing the farmer&apos;s difficulties.45. The other direct effect of a general fall in prices is upon the fixed charges in farming, and those costs which can only be adjusted downward with difficulty. Conspicuous amongst these is mortgage interest.   The indebtedness contracted to be paid off over-j This interval of time has been investigated by Mr. Dampier-Whetham and is related to what he has termed &quot; the economic lag in agri-culture.&quot; By weighting various factors in production he calculates a fixed period as though all costs were incurred at one time and all sales were effected at one time. By this means he found the &quot;economic lag&quot; to be about fourteen months for a typical arable farm and about seven months for a typical grass dairy farm. Hence, this effect of a general fall in prices is more severe in arable than in grass dairy farming.
a period of time is incurred by the farmer on the assumption that the purchasing power of the monetary unit in which the debt has to be repaid will remain the same in future. If this does not happen, and&apos; if, through a fall in the general price level, the purchasing power of money is altered, more farm produce is required to redeem the debt. In this country during the last ten years, the farmer who bought his farm in 1920 or thereabouts, raising the purchase money by way of a mortgage based on the then value of the farm, found that in each year of falling prices a larger and larger part of the produce of the farm had to be sold in order to pay the mortgage charges.46. Eent is not adjusted downwards automatically with prices. Therefore, as prices slowly fall, the burden of rent increases; a disparity develops and continues to wdden until some re-adjustment has to be brought about by an agreement between landlord and tenant. Hence, a fall in rents has usually lagged behind a fall in produce prices, as was shown in the long depression after 1873. In the depression during the last ten years, this factor has been of less importance than in the former period, firstly because the system of yearly agreements has now taken the place of the former system of long leases, and secondly because the average level of rents did not rise after the war by more than 20 or 25 per cent., while the level of prices rose by about 200 per cent. English rents have since fallen to 10 per cent, or less above pre-war figures and are still falling.47. Wages (which in many branches of farming form the largest single item in cost of production) have since 1925, to all intents and purposes, been stationary. As prices have fallen, wages have remained at approximately the same level, real wages have risen, and the farmer who did not change his methods has found, that each year a larger and larger amount of produce must be sold off the farm to meet the wages bill. Wages form a higher proportion of the total costs in arable than in most kinds of grass farming, and, consequently, the general fall in prices has once more worked itself out with greater severity amongst arable farmers.48. A continuous fall in the level of general commodity prices creates an unfavourable economic environment, in which the farmer&apos;s calculations, based on the ordinary data of experience, must almost inevitably be miscalculations. The farmer, for example, lays out a certain amount of money on the cost of production and often incurs certain debts to banks, tradesmen and others, relying on his normal farm receipts to clear the debts. In so doing, he takes the usual risk of the fluctuations in price which are unavoidable in farming, but his expectation is that in the long run these fluctuations will average themselves out. In a year of bad prices, due (say) to an abundant world harvest, he may not be in a position to discharge fully his farming debts, and he therefore continues on credit, in the expectation of a future improvement in prices. In normal circumstances, this is a perfectly correct use of credit, but in periods when the general level of prices is falling, these calculations must inevitably be misleading. A year of bad prices is followed by another and yet another, and the expected recovery does not come. One of the consequences, therefore, of a general fall in prices is a tendency for the volume of debts to increase and to be carried forward even after prices have become stable. We have no direct means of ascertaining the total volume of farm indebtedness, but such evidence as is forthcoming from indirect sources confirms the view that, particularly in arable districts, farming is seriously handicapped by debts contracted at a higher price level which remain to be paid off by the sale of produce at lower prices.49. Further, agriculture at all times is exposed to relatively violent fluctuations consequent upon the size of world harvests, the nature of the seasons, outbreaks of disease, &amp;c. One of the effects of a falling price level is to create a state of affairs, in which agricul-ture is less able to sustain the shocks due to adverse seasons or
similar causes than it otherwise would be. When a fall in the price of an agricultural commodity due to abundant foreign supplies or a loss of profits due to some other cause has been superimposed on a general fall in commodity prices, a crisis amongst the producers of that commodity has not infrequently occurred. There are several historical instances of this. The cold and wet summer of 1879, accompanied by one of the worst harvests and outbreaks of disease amongst cattle and sheep, produced such a crisis. Severe depression was caused in this way by the pressure of foreign wheat on the British market in the late Seventies and from about 1882 to 1895. Cold summers in 1891 and 1892, and a drought in 1893, again produced a crisis. During the whole of this period, commodity prices were slowly falling owing to the appreciation in the value of gold. In the post-war period, there was the minor crisis of 1923-1924, which mainly affected the corn-growing districts, and was largely due to the great expansion of the production of cereals in the United States of America, Canada, the Argentine and Australia during the War. There was also the fall in meat and live-stock prices in 1926 and 1927, brought about by the increased imports of chilled beef from the Argentine during the so-called Argentine meat war, and finally the present critical condition in regard to a large part of the arable districts due mainly to abnormally low cereal prices.50. During the last ten years all these influences have been operative in a greater or less degree. In the first part of this period the fall in prices that occurred was the most rapid for which there are statistical records, and but for the fact that it followed immedately upon a period of rapidly rising prices (1914 to 1920), during which large profits were made, agriculture would have undoubtedly suffered a more serious crisis. At the end of 1923, British farmers might well have written off the previous ten years as a wholly abnormal period. Large profits and large losses had been made, but, except in the corn growing districts, where exceptionally low cereal prices had prevailed, the position was not serious. Nevertheless, the experience of the previous three years and the losses which farmers had sustained had produced a certain discouragement; the future was looked to with uncertainty, indeed with anxiety. What agriculture then needed was a reasonably stable level of prices, a period of recuperation from the financial difficulties which the three years of deflation had imposed upon it.51. Unfortunately, the signs of greater stability which appeared in 1924 proved to be only temporary, and in the following year and subsequently farmers had to face a further fall in prices. From the beginning of 1925 there was a fall in the general price level which accompanied the raising of the dollar exchange to par, and from 1925 onwards there have been further serious declines in the general level of commodity prices.   Agricultural prices fell: 52. Apart from the fall in the general price level, the other general factor in the situation is the rise in wages, on the re-establishment of Wages Boards in 1925 and the constant level that they have since maintained, in spite of falling prices.53.   We may therefore cany the analysis a step further.   Thefollowing table (Table 10) compares the movement of the index of commodity prices published by the &quot; Statist,&quot; firstly with the index of agricultural prices, and secondly with indices representing the prices of agricultural produce grouped under the three main headings &quot;Live-stock and Live-stock Products,&quot; &quot;Cereals and farm crops,&quot; &quot;Fruit and Vegetables.&quot; The first of these three groups represents roughly 70 per cent, of the gross output sold off the farms, the second approximately 20 per cent, and the third approximately 10 per cent.December 1924 to December 1925 .uu ueueiuuor lu^o ...1925 ,, ,, 1926 ...1926 ,, ,, 1927 ...1927 ,, ,, 1928 ...1928 ,, ,, 1929 ...1929 ,, April 1930 ...Per cent. 6&apos;7 ,V25- 5 + 1 &quot;5 (rise) + 2-1 ( ,, ) -4-9[21261]d

I Vegetables only.The figures in the column for agricultural wages merely represent the change in weekly wages compared with 1914; as explained above they do not represent the full change in the money wages of hired labour reckoned on an hourly basis if allowance is made for the reduction of hours and rates paid for overtime which have resulted from the wages legislation. For the purposes of comparison therefore the final column in the Table is based on the rough estimates of this item in farm costs, referred to in paragraph 22 above.54. We may therefore turn to an examination of the three groups of farm produce here represented. In regard to the live-stock and live-stock products group, on the whole the fall in prices has been less than the general fall in commodity prices shown in column 2. The worst periods were probably 1920-22, when prices were falling very rapidly, and 1925-27, when live-stock prices were unusually depressed on account of the heavy imports from the Argentine. Belative to the level of commodity prices, prices in this group have been good, as milk, which is an important component, enjoys a natural protection. The chief disparity in this case is between the index representing the money wages per hour of the labour employed and the index of prices. Labour, however, on the whole, forms a considerably smaller proportion of the total costs of production in this group than in the cereals and farm crops group; moreover, against the higher cost of labour must be set certain compensating advantages, namely : (a) low costs of feeding stuffs and fertilisers, which are downto almost pre-war level;(b) the fact that the level of rents has undoubtedly been lower than the level of prices.55. The third group (fruit and vegetables), like the first, has on the whole enjoyed relatively high prices and for this reason has suffered less during the period under review although the drought last year had serious consequences in certain districts.56. When we turn to the second group cereals and farm crops, a very different state of affairs is shown. Not only have prices fallen, but they have done so substantially faster than the general fall in commodity prices. The relationship is the reverse of that in the live-stock group.   Furthermore, in the cereal group
wages form a relatively high proportion of the total costs and the low cost of fertilisers has gone but a little way towards compen-sating the farmer for the wide disparity between cereal prices and the cost of labour.(d.) Causes of the special Decline of Prices of Arable Crops.(i.) The &quot;Dumping of Cereals.&quot;57. It has been alleged recently that &quot;dumping&quot; has been an important factor in the present depression amongst cereal farmers. The word &quot;dumping&quot; is used in many senses. If a commodity is imported and sold at a loss it is &quot; dumped.&quot; If a foreign commodity is sold at. less than the price in country of origin, it is &quot; dumped.&quot; If a foreign commodity is sold at less than its average cost of production it is &quot;dumped.&quot; In foreign countries where the internal value of the currency exceeds the world-value, producers are enabled to sell cheaply abroad at a profit. This &quot;exchange&quot; or &quot;valuta&quot; &quot;dumping&quot; has, in the past, lost the British producer much trade. &quot;Dumping&quot; in all the senses given above has inflicted serious injury on many British trades in recent years, but agriculture has been by no means the most conspicuous sufferer. To counteract the &quot;dumping&quot; of cereals, there has been a loud demand for State action. Farmers in England protest against the importation of bounty-fed wheat and oats from Germany and barley from Russia; those in Scotland against the importation of bounty-fed oats.(a.) Wheat.58. In the last four cereal years (1925-26 to 1928-29) the imports of German wheat have varied from nothing to 8 per cent, of the total supplies. The total imports of German wheat in the last of those years were less than in the first. Yov the first five months of the current cereal year they were substantially less than in the corresponding period of the previous year.59. Under the German import bond system the exporter is undoubtedly able to sell wheat abroad at lower prices than he would be otherwise able to do; but naturally he sells at the best market price. A report recently prepared by a conference of the departments concerned states that: &quot; Examination of the prices at the more important, local wheat markets does not reveal any noticeable irregularity between these and the general average of England and Wales. Any depression which may have occurred in British prices appears to have been felt more or less evenly throughout the country, and not to have been concentrated in any particular markets.&quot;We are satisfied that the volume of imports from Germany is insufficient to have had a material effect on prices.60. In regard to France, the position is more obscure. Up to April last imports of wheat and flour under the existing French wheat law do not appear to have been an appreciable factor in depressing of wheat prices. We understand, however, that during May and June large additional imports have been received aided apparently by some form of payment by the French Government. We are not in a position to say what, if any, has been the effect of these imports on prices, nor how long the heavier rate of imports is likely to be maintained.(b.) Oats.61. The position in regard to oats is somewhat different. Although the total imports from all sources for the cereal year 1928-29 were below the average, the total quantity of German oats received by the United Kingdom in that year was 1,446,000 cwt., as compared with 876,000 cwt. in 1925-26. In the current cereal year there has been a further large increase in imports of oats from Germany, which have more than counterbalanced a certain decrease in imports from other countries.62.   The exporter of German oats, like the exporter of German wheat, receives assistance under the import bond system, and to that extent receives an artificial encouragement to export to this [21261] n 2
country. Over the period during which German imports have been increasing, the prices of oats have been falling, and have now reached a level substantially below pre-war, but it that theprice at which German oats have been sold in British markets has usually been higher, and not lower, than the prices of home produced oats. Moreover, other factors have exerted an important, if not predominant, influence on the prices of oats, the chief of these being the general fall in the price of feeding stuffs. It would seem a fair inference from the information available that there is some causal connection between the volume of German oats imported during recent months and the fall in prices. Exactly what this connection is we have not been able to determine.(c.) Barley.63. As will be seen from the following table (Table 11), barley has been imported from Russia in large quantities in recent months. The price of this barley has been very low and by some it is regarded as having been &quot; dumped.&quot;Table 11. Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Imports of Barley from Russia.Quantity.Year. Cwt.1924       ...............      1,102,8591925       ...............      3,611,5161926       .........      ......      8,228,9681927................ 498,7041929       ...............1928       ...............1980 (January to May only)......      1,649,504(ii.) Effect of Foreign Tariffs.64. It is somewhat surprising that public notice has been concentrated on the particular form of interference with trade in cereals referred to in the preceding paragraphs, an interference adopted by few countries and affecting comparatively small quantities of produce. A much more extensive and important interference has passed practically unnoticed. The &quot; dumping &quot; policy of foreign countries in its effect on British farmers during the last few years seems to us trivial, in relation to the progressive increase in tariffs on cereals by the chief European countries.65. The facts are plain. During the period since 1924 when the great wheat-growing countries overseas were steadily increasing their production, as shown in Table 13, the chief importing countries of Europe were obstructing the importation of wheat and other cereals into their own markets. Great Britain remained the principal free market for the world&apos;s surplus grain, and the rising tariffs elsewhere concentrated the pressure of any surplus upon the markets of this country.66. Of the countries in Europe, which on an average import annually a minimum of 150,000 tons of wheat, Austria, Czecho-Slovakia, Germany, Greece and Italy have all raised their tariffs on cereals since 1924. In Denmark, the Irish Free State and Holland the importation of cereals has been duty free, and no change in tariffs has taken place in Sweden and Switzerland. In France the tariffs, though lower than in 1924, have been increased since 1926. The outstanding example of drastic increases is Germany, where in 1924 the importation of wheat, barley and oats was duty free,* while on the 25th April, 1980, after several successive increases, the duty stood at: wheat 7/6d., barley (subject to a modification in the case of cattle fodder) 7/6d. per ewt., oats 6/0d. per cwt.67.   These high tariffs may well have been a material factor inthe depression of cereal prices in this oountry.* Tlio exemption of wheat from duty was a special post-war measure. Before the war there was a duty of 2s. 9d. per cwt.
(iii.) Increased World Production.68. Apart from the downward trend of the general price-level, the fall in wheat prices is clearly the result mainly of increased production abroad. The following table (Table 12), based on statistics prepared by the International Institute of Agriculture, shows the extent to which the chief wheat-producing countries have contributed to the world output during the five years prior to the War and during the four years 1925-28.Table 12.- World Production of Wheat.

The growth in output has been mainly due to the great wheat-producing countries, North and South America and Australia. Eelative to the pre-war figure Canada holds the fore-most place, but the production of the Argentine and Australia also shows considerable increase. The following table (Table 13), also prepared by the International Institute of Agriculture, shows the increase in the area under wheat in various countries.Table 18.

If the changes in the world wheat production and wheat area are set out as index numbers, based on 1909-13 = 100, the following percentage increases are found : Table 14.	1909-13.	1925.	1926.	1927.	1928.

It is apparent therefore that, on the average of 1925-28, theincrease of production compared with that before the War has
coincided almost exactly with the area under cultivation. The serious fall in prices which took place as a result of the record harvest of 1928 was mainly the result of the abundant yields in Canada, the United States, Argentina and Australia, following upon, in the first three of these countries, good harvests in the previous year.72. Two other factors, according to the statement issued by the International Institute of Agriculture, have had some bearing on the wheat situation, namely, an appreciable decline in the average world&apos;s consumption of wheat per head and the gradual growth during the last four years of the annual carry-over of wheat, which has now reached a higher figure than any previously recorded. There seems no doubt that the policy of &quot;holding&quot; by the Canadian wheat pools delayed the effect on prices of the abundant crop of 1928; but there remains considerable apprehension that the high world-stocks controlled by a small number of large organisations may depress prices further.78. The fall in price of barley and oats is partly due to the influence of the excessive supplies of wheat in the world, partly to heavy European production of feeding crops in 1928-29, and in the case of oats, to some extent to the imports of relatively cheap &quot;bounty-fed &quot; oats from Germany (see paragraphs 61 to 62).74. The sharp fall in price of potatoes in 1929-30 is due to over-production in this country, during the last two years. There is no reason to expect that potato prices will not recover.(iv.) Conclusions.75. To sum up this part of our Inquiry, we are of the opinion that the &quot;dumping&quot; of wheat by Germany and other Continental countries has been a relatively unimportant factor in depressing its price during the years under review. The action of European countries in progressively raising their tariffs against the importation of wheat has been a more serious factor.76. In general, we are satisfied that the main cause of the excep-tional fall in the price of wheat is to be found in the progressive increase in recent years of the world area under cultivation and in the record harvest of 1928.77. The dumping of oats has been more extensive than that of wheat, but the fall in the price of oats (and in that of barley) has been largely due to the influence on the market of wheat supplies and feed-ing stuffs which are to some extent alternatives.78. The sharp fall in the price of potatoes has been due to over-production in this country during the last two years.Y.-COMPARISON OF THE POSITION OF AGRICULTURE WITH THAT OF OTHER UNSHELTERED INDUSTRIES ANV) THE EFFECT OF IMPORTS ON THE FOREIGN EXCHANGES.(a.) Comparison with other Unsheltered Industries.79. The situation which we have examined in the foregoing paragraphs is not peculiar to agriculture but is common to the unsheltered industries as a whole. The decline in world prices during recent years which has embarrassed farming has also brought depression to practically every industry which has to meet foreign competition at home or abroad. Although there have been substantial reductions of wages in several of the unsheltered industries in recent years, these reductions have not, as a rule, been on a scale commensurate with the reduction in selling prices. A resultant disparity between wages and selling prices as compared with the pre-war position is accordingly a feature common to all unsheltered occupations; and agriculture by no means provides the most striking example of this disparity. In shipping, for example, the money level of freight rates is well below what it was
before the War, although wages are much higher. As regards the volume of production, agriculture makes a distinctly favour-able showing as compared with some of the principal old-established industries. For, whereas the volume of agricultural production is, if anything, somewhat greater than it was before the War, there has been a substantial decline in the volume of production in shipbuilding and the leading textile industries. Nor is the fact that the volume of employment has declined, although the volume of production has been maintained, in any way peculiar to agriculture. In the main branches of the iron and steel industry, for example, where the volume of production has increased as compared with 1907 by something like 25 per cent., employment has declined by 24 per cent. The production of a given volume of output with a smaller supply of labour is, indeed, of the essence of the industrial tendencies of the present day.80. From the economic standpoint, the problem of agriculture is part of the larger problem of the depression of the unsheltered indus-tries, and there is no clear &quot;economic&quot; ground for singling out agriculture, as a whole, as a peculiarly strong claimant for special assistance.(b.) Effects of Imports on the Foreign Exchanges.81. There is another possibility of a somewhat different kind which might make it unwise for the country to rely in so large a degree as it does to-day on the importation of food-stuffs from abroad. If the export trade were to continue to decline, the task of paying for imports on their present scale might cause some embarrassment. The balance of trade is already very different from what it was before the War. Formerly, the value of the exports of commodities and services was roughly commensurate with that of imports, and practically the whole of the large sums due to this country as interest and dividends on overseas invest-ments was available for re-investment abroad. To-day the exports of commodities and services are insufficient to pay for imports, and it is necessary to use for this purpose a large proportion (probably something like half) of the interest on overseas invest-ments. Internationally speaking, Great Britain has passed, as a nation, from the position of a man who spends no more than his earned income, and saves the whole of his unearned income, to that of a man who depends largely on his unearned income to meet his expenditure. This, of course, is very far from being a desperate position; but the tendency is disquieting, particularly as the future prospects of the export trade are far from good.82. But there is more in this point than that of a possible danger in the more or less remote future. It can be argued that the. worsening of the balance of trade position is already a source of some embarrassment to the economic life of this country. It is impossible to invest abroad net in any year more than the amount by which the interest and dividends due exceed the payments to be made in respect of the balance of trade. To the great benefit of our trade, the world has been accustomed to come for its loans to the free market of London, and if too much is lent abroad the sterling exchange suffers and money rates have to be kept up to correct the situation. It is unnecessary to examine this argument in any detail. It is sufficient for the present purpose that the outlook as regards the exchanges and the gold reserve over the next few years is by no means free from anxiety. Whatever weight should be attached to the above consideration, it has no exclusive application to agriculture. It supplies an argument, for whatever it is worth, in favour of protective or other measures which would serve to diminish the total of imports.For the sake of the foreign exchanges, there would be some advantage in reducing the volume of imports and thus making the balance of trade less unfavourable, but agriculture can put forward no claim for assistance on these grounds that cannot be put forward with equal force by manufacturing industries which are exposed to foreign competition in the home market.
YI THE  NATIONAL IMPORTANCE OF AGRICULTURE.83. We recognise that agriculture has special features which differentiate it from other industries.84.   In particular, it is often argued that a stream of emigrationfrom country districts vitalises the towns; that the agricultural population is healthier than that of the town and prevents the deterioration of the town dweller. This matter was dealt with exhaustively in both the Majority and Minority Reports of the Agri-cultural Tribunal of Investigation of 1924. Their conclusion from the available evidence was, however, indefinite. The majority con-sidered the maintenance or increase of the agricultural population important from the national health point of view; the minority was less impressed by this argument. They emphasised the high cost of a subsidy to wheat in relation to the result achieved.* They estimated that a subsidy of  7,000,000 a year might make a difference to the arable area of 1\ million acres; in other words, it might cause the employment in agriculture of an additional 50,000 men. If the average yield is taken at three quarters to the acre, this would mean a subsidy of  1 per quarter, or roughly a 50 per cent, increase of to-day&apos;s price of wheat. The cost to the nation of this increased employment would be 43140 per annum for each man employed, or, after allowance is made for a cheap cottage, it might be said to represent his whole w-age plus 40 per cent. They concluded that the health argument did not provide an adequate reason for the special treatment of agriculture.85. There is no new evidence of importance since 1924, except that the health of the towns has continued to improve, and that the difference between town and country physique has undoubtedly become less. We are inclined to agree with the Minority Report of 1924, that there is some advantage to the general health of the nation in maintaining an agricultural population, but having regard to the fact that less than 7 per cent, of the occupied population is engaged in agriculture, this advantage, when spread over the whole country is slight. We also notice that, as measured by death rates, England is healthier than many West European agricultural countries. We are clearly of opinion that any special State assist-ance to agriculture for reasons of national health would not be justified.86. A similar argument for special assistance to agriculture is often based on the national need for home-grown food supplies in time of war. This again was dealt with at some length and some-what inconclusively in the Agricultural Tribunal&apos;s Report. We are of opinion that, in present conditions, special measures of assistance to agriculture, as an insurance against difficulties in the event of war, would not be justified.87. There is one other way in which a collapse in even one type of agriculture may affect national interests. It may involve the partial desertion of villages in the depressed areas and depopulation of the country-side. Villages usually represent an establishment of fixed capital in a manner which provides the requisites for a complete and satisfactory life. If that establish -ment decays, and the people are obliged to move to new suburbs round towns, much of the amenity of life may be lost, and in any case a new provision of communal institutions churches, schools, playing-fields, &amp;c. is needed before the complete framework of life can be reconstructed. It would be useless to attempt permanently to withstand economic tendencies, but, if the emergency be temporary, it may be well worth while, from a national point of view, to preserve the economic and social structure which exists till the emergency is past and that structure is again able to stand by itself on an economic basis.88. There is also one important economic aspect in which agri-culture differs from other industries, and that is in the immense volume of imports of products which might be grown within the country..* Report of Agricultural Tribunal of Investigation, 1924, p. 194.
89. Not only is agriculture still the largest single industry both as regards the amount of employment given and the volume of production, but it is unique in the size of the home market which might conceivably be captured for home products. Our total agricultural imports of food-stuffs are about  390,000,000; of this, about  800,000,000 are food-stuffs of kinds which are produced in this country. Apart from economic reasons, there appear to be no technical grounds why a large part of these supplies could not be grown at home.90. Having regard to the large and continued amount of unemployment, this great potential market at our very doors is a matter of the greatest importance. It is eminently desirable that we should use all means in our power to increase agricultural production in this country to the greatest practicable extent.91. Since 1908, the volume of agricultural production has been maintained, but employment has fallen by about 11 per cent. We have shown that wages have risen in relation to prices to such an extent that money wages calculated on an hourly basis are now about double what they were before the War, whereas prices have increased by only 37 per cent. In these circumstances, farmers have done well to maintain the volume of their production.92. The reduction in employment is by no means due entirely to the reduction in arable area, or to less intensive farming. This is undoubtedly one important reason for the employment of less men; but it is equally undoubted that the adoption of better and more efficient methods by the farmers has enabled them to reduce the amount of labour employed without reducing production. A substantial portion of the reduction in employment is due to what is now-a-days called rationalisation, and is, therefore, to be welcomed as a sign of increased efficiency.93. It is important to realise that there is a definite clash between a policy of higher wages than in the past, and a high employment policy. The enactment of the Agricultural Wages (regulation.) Act in 1924, which conferred statutory powers for the fixation of wages, was a definite decision on the part of the country to adopt a higher wage policy. Money wages since then have remained stable, and the decrease of retail prices has meant a steady rise of real wages.94. Public opinion is still in favour of the maintenance of wages at about their present level, and it is extremely doubtful, in our opinion, whether the low wages of the past were favourable, on a long view, to agricultural efficiency. It must be appre-ciated that this higher level of wages has a double effect in decreasing employment, firstly, in causing the putting down of arable to grass, and generally the adoption of types of farming that require less labour, and, secondly, a keener search for labour-saving methods.95. We welcome the fact that the real wages of agricultural labourers are higher than they were before the War, and we hold that farmers must adapt their operations to the higher cost of labour. Though the higher level of wages is undoubtedly a source of difficulty to farmers, we are satisfied that the level is not too high, having regard to the wages paid by others, and especially by sheltered trades, and that, if only to avert a drift of labour to the towns, agricultural wages as high as those now prevailing must be regarded as inevitable and right. Moreover, we hold that the policy adopted by progressive farmers to meet the situation so created the policy of employing fewer men is also inevitable and that it is the right policy. What is important from the national point of view is the maintenance of farming as a financially successful industry able to pay good wages, combined with a steady increase in the value of agricultural produc-tion. While in particular cases we must accept the reduction in the aggregate amount of employment which has been and is going on, in others the financial success of the farmer may enable him to intensify his methods and thus employ more men.[21261]e
YII THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE POSITION OF BRITISH AGRICULTURE CAN BE IMPROVED BY NORMAL METHODS.(a.) General Considerations.96. The extent to which it may be possible by normal methods to improve the position of British agriculture must depend on the future course of prices. Prices have fallen so heavily and to such low levels in recent months that some recovery in the wholesale index number, when the present slump has run its course, can be confidently expected; and this recovery is likely to extend to the prices of cereals. Whether the recovery will go so far as to take prices back to the level of a year or two ago is, however, extremely doubtful. It would be imprudent to ignore the possibility that over the next decade the downward trend of prices may reassert itself.97. In the following paragraphs, we propose to examine the extent to which the situation can be improved by the reform of marketing methods and of farming practice.(b.) Reforms in Marketing.98. Since the War, it has been generally realised that organised marketing in agriculture is of the first importance, and that it is a field in which State help and guidance is particularly valuable. Much time and energy have been devoted by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Department of Agriculture for Scotland to this work.99.   The main objects of marketing reform are : (a) To secure to the farmer for the largest possible proportion of his produce the full price ruling in the open market;(fc) To eliminate unnecessary competition between producers, and to reduce waste in the processes of collection and bulking, so as to secure to the farmer his share of the spread that now exists between the price paid by the consumer and that received by the producer;(c) To advertise and extend the demand for the produce of British farmers.100. Efforts are being made to achieve these objects mainly in two ways: by standardisation and by organisation.(i) Standardisation.101. Ten years ago, standardisation had been adopted to a considerable extent in the Dominions and other countries from which Great Britain imports agricultural produce, whereas relatively little has been done in this country by producers to turn out large quantities of uniform quality. The result has been to throw the control of prices into the hands of traders who buy and bulk the variable parcels received from the producer. Again, large consuming firms tend to prefer imported produce, the grade of which is known. The result, in the past, was that British produce lacked uniformity, and for this reason often failed to secure its full value of the market.102. The advantages of standardisation, where it is practicable, are now sufficiently well known to need little elaboration. Standardisation inspires confidence in the buyer; enables purchase on description to supersede purchase on inspection; facilitates large-scale trading and transport; and eliminates waste. It is essential to accurate and uniform market price quotations, and forms the basis of trade reputation and advertisement.103. Under the Agricultural Produce (Grading and Marketing) Act, 1928, a number of standard grades have already been defined, and there is already evidence that these standard grades, and the National Mark scheme, which has been applied to many classes of produce, are proving successful both in securing regular high quality and, to some extent, in improving market prices.
(ii) Organisation.104. The second method of improving marketing is through the organisation of producers. Here again, more has been done in other countries. The wheat pools in Canada and Australia are perhaps the outstanding examples.105. Large-scale organisations of national scope may do valuable work in many ways. One example is the effective advertisement of farm produce on a national scale, as, for instance, the advertising of the food value of milk. Effective bargaining with distributors&apos; organisations, which are more and more being organised on a great scale, is again only possible through some centralised organisation. In the same way, large-scale organisa-tion helps to maintain a fair price for farm produce, on the one hand, for regulating production to suit demand (e.g., for the prevention of a glut such as we have recently had in potatoes, with its corresponding disastrous break in prices), on the other hand, for maintaining prices against the strong pressure which can be exerted by powerful buyers.106. It is well known that such organisations often break down owing to the action of a minority, who prefer to sell independently, and thereby take full advantage of the regulation of supplies exercised by the combination without bearing any share of its liabilities. Some of us hold that it may sometimes be necessary for the State to give to the majority power to compel the dissident minority to join them in the common interest, but it is not unusual to find the most efficient and go-ahead men among the minority. In our view, the power to compel a minority to adhere to a common policy should be used sparingly and only when a lack of unity definitely obstructs progress.107. In addition to its direct advantages, the organisation of farmers into corporate bodies for the purpose of marketing provides a means by which many indirect advantages can be gained. It is bound to have some beneficial influence on production, as it has done in Denmark, the United States and elsewhere, in inducing farmers to improve breeds, to concentrate on certain lines of produce for which there is a proved demand, in short to produce what the market wants instead of marketing what the farmer chooses to produce. Again, organisations of farmers should prove to be a valuable medium of education through which knowledge of modern methods and of new developments in competing countries can be disseminated.108. Organisation of farmers is also a necessary precedent for finance, if as, in other countries, the industry of British agriculture finds it necessary to seek capital from outside its own restricted circle.- 109. The whole question of the large-scale organisation of farmers for marketing purposes is still in its infancy. It offers great possibilities and is one of the forms of rationalisation for British farming which should be pushed forward vigorously and assisted by the Government by such means as are at its disposal.(iii) Limitations of Marketing.110. Notwithstanding these undoubted advantages, marketing reform by itself cannot solve the chief problem which confronts British farmers to-day and which is at the root of the agricultural depression. To regard marketing as the only, or even the principal sphere in which a radical change in practice is required would be to misconceive its importance in relation to the problem as a whole.111. However beneficial marketing reform may prove, there will remain a problem the ultimate solution of which lies within the farm and not outside it. The fundamental fact of the situation which we have sought to analyse is the disparity between costs of production and prices a wide disparity where depression is acute, a less marked [21261] B 2
disparity where it is less serious. If this problem can be solved by the action of those engaged in the industry, it must be solved by a change not only of marketing practice but of farming practice. Furthermore, in those branches of farming which have suffered most seriously and which constitute the most immediate and most difficult problem i.e., where the main income is derived from the sale of cereals domestic prices&apos; will continue to be determined by world prices, and the possible improvement which better marketing could achieve remains, therefore, confined within relatively narrow limits. In regard to these branches of agriculture, the farmers and the State alike should turn their attention to improving the technique of production.(iv.) Conclusions.112. It cannot be expected that the reform of marketing can be effected so quickly as to provide a remedy for the immediate situa-tion. But, taking a long view, it is clear that radical changes in our marketing system are needed, that the ultra-individualistic marketing methods of the farmer must be drastically changed, and that successful development on these lines would bring advantages of great and far-reaching importance to British agriculture.(c.) Improvements in Farming Methods.(i.) General Considerations.113. The main item in the farmers&apos; outgoings, which has risen disproportionately to the rise in prices since the pre-war period, is wages, which, while prices have continued to fall, have remained stationary since 1925. Farmers would have been confronted with the same problem, if the rise in wages had been due to a scarcity of labour. British farm-wages are certainly not out of scale with other British wages. While lower than agri-cultural wages in a number of countries from which Great Britain purchases a large part of her food-supplies, they are higher than those of other European countries. Their disparity with the latter is a sign of the higher standard of remuneration obtaining in Great Britain, as compared with the rest of Europe.114. Wages form a varying proportion of the total costs of pro-duction, amounting in the some exceptional types of farming to as much as 50 per cent., and in others to as little as 20 percent, or less. In arable farming and in intensive dairy farming the proportion is high, running from 30 per cent, to 40 per cent.; in grass land sheep farming and some forms of cattle grazing it is low. The rise of wages in the post-war period has brought farmers face to face with the problem of how to adapt farming practice to the increase of this item of farming costs. The problem in itself would not have proved so difficult in more normal circumstances. Progressive farmers are alive to the need for employing&apos; labour-saving machinery and generally of making the best use of the labour that they employ. What has added greatly to the difficulty is that the rise of wages has occurred in a time of falling prices. But even under this handicap, much has already been accomplished, particularly in the branches of agriculture devoted to animal husbandry, where the fall in prices has been less rapid and the amount of labour employed is smaller. The methods by which the solution of this problem must be sought obviously differ between one branch of agriculture and another. The need for change in farming practice is less marked in animal husbandry; the chief problem relates to cereal farming.115. There are certain forms of the farming business which are independent of the cultivation of the land, and are, therefore, capable of an expansion which is not limited by the amount of land available. The production of pigs, for example, resembles a manufacturing process by which materials like barley-meal and milling offals are converted into meat. The production of eggs and poultry is a similar process of conversion mainly of cereal foods which are not necessarily grown by the producer, but may be purchased. Both industries require in themselves little land. The essential requisite is cheap feeding stuffs, which are at least
equally available to British producers as to their foreign, competitors. In both industries, considerable advances have been made of late years, but British farming is as yet far from taking full advantage of the opportunities offered by the home market. It has been estimated that the replacement of the imports of pig products by home production would provide for the employment of 40,000 men; similarly, with poultry products 30,000 men could be employed in producing the current imports. The value of the imports amount to  60,000,000 and  25,000,000 respectively. The obstacles to the capture of these industries is the lack of technical knowledge and business methods on the part of producers, and, above all, the absence of adequate organisation of processing and marketing. The production of milk products imported to the value of approximately  74,000,000, which though, in part, dependent upon the same class of purchased foods, is complicated by the fact that much of the competing milk which supplies these imports is obtained from grazing land at a much lower cost than is possible to us. By similar improvements in the organisation of marketing and advertisement, it would even be possible to obtain a great expansion of milk production, and it might also be possible to extend the sales of liquid milk to the advantage of our children and our farmers.116. It has often been suggested that an extensive conversion of British farms, with their comparatively large acreage, into smaller units, workable by a single man and his family, would result in a great increase of employment upon the land and a larger production of food. We do not wish to enter into a general discussion of the value of small holdings in the agricultural economy, but we are agreed that they do not provide a remedy for the depression prevailing in the distressed areas. Apart from the question of the cost-of conversion, which is not recoverable in the rents which can be charged, the typical corn-growing land will not provide a living for the small holder, nor will the conver-sion of what is now arable land into such small farms extend the employment upon the land to any marked extent. The value of family farms and their capacity of resistance to falling prices depends on the Willingness of their occupiers to give their labour below the current rates of pay, but they cannot add to the productiveness of the classes of land that are now suffering from low world prices. The social value of family farms is great. Amongst other things, they afford opportunities of recruitment to the farming business, but they must maintain themselves by taking advantage of the specialised industries like pig and poultry keeping, or vegetable growing rather than the cultivation of staple crops.117. It has been suggested that many improvements in farming technique woidd be rendered possible if cheap electric power were made available to farmers. We understand that this subject is receiving the close attention of the Electricity Commis-sioners, who are arranging a number of &quot; demonstration &quot; schemes in rural areas.(ii.) Cereal Farming.(a) The Conditions of the Problem.118. The question how far changes in farming practice can solve the problem of the disparity between the levels of wages and prices must, of course, depend on the future course of prices, but even if cereal prices recovered from their present low level, they could not be expected to return to the old parity between wages and prices. A new relation between wages and prices as compared with their pre-war values must be expected to remain a permanent feaure of British agriculture. The implications seem to us clear; a farm technique built up in the past on an abundance of cheap labour is no longer efficient. The transition from a practice based on cheap labour to a practice based on a more expensive labour is to-day, and has been since 1925, the outstanding problem in farm management. Nor is the call for such re-adjustment a new feature of British farming.   Within the memory of living farmers
aoa sack of wheat paid for two weeks&apos; wages; from the beginning of this century up to the War, when most of the present day farmers learnt their business, a sack of wheat paid approximately for a week&apos;s wages: at present, three sacks would not pay for two weeks&apos; wages. Much of the current distress is due to the rapidity with which farmers have been called upon to meet these changed ratios.119. In the difficult circumstances brought about by the fall in prices, the main change adopted by farmers is the laying down of arable land to grass. This has been done partly because cereal prices fell and partly to economise labour.120. Conversion of arable land to grass has frequently been regarded as a national disaster. The State has at times been urged to spend vast sums of public money to prevent it. We cannot accept this view. The agricultural policy of the State since 1924 has, in effect, been to impose upon farmers the obligation to pay the statutory rates of wages leaving to them the task of making any adjustments in farming practice which these conditions necessitate. Obviously, the farmer has been obliged to meet these conditions by making certain changes. When a farmer converts arable land to grass, he must be presumed to do so, because he believes that it will pay or at any rate minimise losses, and that it is the best way within his knowledge of meeting the changed conditions with which he is faced. If the change does not lead to a diminution in the value of the net output of British agriculture, but merely to an alteration in its character, we think that the State should face the fact, even if it involves a reduction in agricultural employment. It is the logical consequence of the existing policy, and if the State were to take steps to counteract it, a vicious circle would be created from -which there would be no escape.121. Moreover, physical conditions in this country have an important bearing on this point. There is one handicap under which wheat farmers will continue as long as the United Kingdom remains an island in the east of the Atlantic. The.moist, cool, changeable climate, which gives the greater part of this country the best grass in the world and helps to make it the best nursery for stock, adds greatly to the cost and risk of growing wheat, for which a continental climate is more suitable. It seems to us dangerous to support a policy which encourages farmers to disregard the basic facts of their trade or to cultivate their land in any other way than that which best suits the soil and climate.122. On the other hand, physical conditions unquestionably place a limit upon the land which can be converted from arable to good pasture. The eastern area still remaining under the plough which depends for its income largely on corn growing, is, broadly speaking, unsuitable both in soil and climate for conversion to permanent pasture. Almost all of it has an annual rainfall of less than 30 inches, much of it less than 25 inches, and the characteristic features is the low rainfall in April and May. There is thus a reasonable expectation of good harvest weather, but the recurring droughts in spring and early summer, often accompanied by high temperatures, are adverse to the success of permanent pastures. Moreover, a large and rapid increase in the production of milk, before farmers have learned to co-operate and organise their market and stimulate consumption, might glut the market and involve them in disaster. The whole period since 1923-24 has witnessed the struggles of the more active farmers in arable districts to reconstruct their system to meet the altered values. Turnips and other root crops have been abandoned or reduced. Grass sheep have taken the place of arable sheep. A certain number of farmers have recast their farming, and while keeping their land under the plough have looked round in every direction in order to economise labour. Some have resorted to farming the land more cheaply by a system of three or four years temporary grass alternating with three or four years of successive corn crops. These efforts seem to us to have been correct, but their success has been masked by continually falling prices.
(b) Lines of Advance.123. Our problem therefore is this: &quot;Can the growing of cereals be made to pay in the depressed areas where the climate is not suitable for permanent grass? &quot;124. An encouraging feature of the situation is that there is evidence that in most districts a few farmers have succeeded in this task even in recent years by the bold adoption of new methods and by efficient management. The technique of the nineteenth century, built up upon cheap labour, must give place to a new technique. Farmers in Great Britain to-day must face the conditions which farmers in some of the great overseas producing countries had to face in the past. Home produced wheat has during the last half century come increasingly into competition with wheat grown on a system very different from that adopted in this country. British farming has hitherto aimed at high production per acre, whereas in overseas countries the object is high production per man. It is interesting to note that according to estimates made by the Food Research Institute at Stanford University, California, in the year 1928-29 the value of the wheat crop per acre in the British Isles was more than double the value in the United States, Canada and the Argentine, and more than three times that of Australia. On the other hand, the value of the crop produced per man in the overseas countries is usually much higher than in the British Isles.125. We have here an outstanding difference between British -and Overseas farming methods. Having regard to these considera-tions, we think that the &quot;long range &quot; problem for corn growing in this country (leaving aside for the moment the immediate situation arising out of the extreme depression of prices) is a change in the method of cultivation. This change might involve radical reforms, such as a change from small to larger farms or from small to larger fields, the filling in of ditches, the removal of hedges, the partial substitution of mechanical power for horse and manual labour in short, a transition towards what in America is described as &quot;power farming.&quot; Another line of advance might be found in the multitude of minor adjustments which constitute the ordinary problems of farm management, without any change in the structure of farms.126. The plain fact is that adequate information is not available upon which a confident judgment can be pronounced on so technical and difficult a problem. What is clear is that the reforms must be carried out by the farmers themselves; but there is ample room for help by the State. Research into farm management is being actively pursued at Government expense in the United States of America. In this country comparatively little has been done, though we are glad to learn that the Ministry of Agriculture now propose to pursue this work on an extended scale. We believe that it is of the utmost importance that research into the whole broad subject of farm management should be pushed forward vigorously, including, probably, large-scale experiments and demonstrations of different methods of cultivation and management, and that the necessary assistance and funds should be provided by the Government.127. We have not been asked, nor are we competent to say, in detail, how British farming should reform its technique, but we do not believe that farming alone of the great industries of the country is not susceptible to rationalisation. When we turn from agriculture to other forms of industry, we see on every side the rationalisation of production being urged forward as a means of overcoming difficulties similar to those from which agriculture is suffering to-day. For these reasons, we cannot accept the contention, either that reorganisation of farming practice is impossible, or that the State, by guaranteeing farm prices, should make it unnecessary.128. We have shown that the fundamental cause of the difficult period through which British agriculture has been going during the last few years has been the higher cost of production combined with a declining price level. The future progress of farming depends mainly on the future level of prices. As we cannot predict this, we cannot give
any definite answer to the question in our terms of reference whether the decline in employment will continue. But we are satisfied that much can be done by adapting farming methods to the new con-ditions. Individual farmers are doing this with success, even in the depressed areas. It is of the utmost importance that the Govern-ment should continue the help which it is already giving so effec-tively along many lines, e.g., research, education, &amp;c. This help is required both in connection with the marketing of goods and methods of production on the farm. In particular, we urge the importance of economic research into methods of cultivation and farm management to suit the new conditions. We are confident that by close co-operation between the State and farmer much can be done to enable British agriculture to face the difficult conditions that we have described, and, while maintaining wages at about the present level, to maintain or increase the volume of agricultural production.VIII. IS THERE A  CASE  FOR  SUBSIDIES   OR  OTHER ABNORMAL METHODS OF HELP TO AGRICULTURE ?(a.) Permanent Assistance.129. It remains for us to consider whether, in addition to what may be called the normal help given by the Government to agriculture through the Departments of Agriculture, there is a case for abnormal forms of assistance, that is to say, for some Government action which would, in effect, either secure to the farmer prices above the world level or otherwise maintain uneconomic production. In the first place we should point out the danger of any permanent policy of subsidies or guaranteed prices. Apart from the public burden they impose, there is the fundamental objection that such action tends to increase over-production and to stereotype existing practice; the fanners&apos; motive for departing from tradition, for seeking a new technique which conforms to the new conditions, is removed, and progress in farm management is consequently checked.130. It should, in our opinion, be a cardinal principle of agricul-tural policy, that it is the first business of a farmer to make his farm pay in the existing conditions of world markets, and measures adopted by the State should promote and not retard economic progress in farming.131. Secondly, we would emphasise the fact that other unsheltered industries are suffering from depression, in some cases even more severe than that of farming. It is generally agreed that the business of those industries is to rationalise themselves by adopt-ing more efficient methods of production and sale. We believe the same applies to farming.132. We believe, therefore, that if the right methods are adopted there is a reasonable prospect that corn-growing can be made to pay in this country and that in other directions the business of the farmer can be expanded. This must, of course, depend on the future movement of world prices, which cannot be predicted, but we think that it is of the first importance that a great effort should be made by British farmers to meet the new world situation by better management and organisation.133. There is not, in our judgment, sufficient substance in any of the arguments which rest on the superior health and vitality of the rural population or on the importance of agriculture to the national defence, to warrant such a discrimination.134. We are convinced that permanent Government assistance in the form of guaranteed prices or acreage subsidies, which would make it easier to continue obsolete methods should not be given. Any assistance accorded should be directed to furthering the adoption of improved methods of production and distribution.
(b.) Temporary Assistanoe.135. We have given careful consideration to the question whether the State would be justified in adopting some temporary measure of assistance to agriculture, such as a subsidy or protection, to meet the present emergency. So far as the greater part of British agriculture is concerned, we are satisfied that no such step is necessary. There is, however, a very serious depression, which has continued for some years, in about one-tenth of the industry, which depends mainly on the growing of corn, and the recent rapid fall in corn prices has accentuated the severity of this depression. As we have implied above, we do not believe that the correct remedy for this situation is a return to the days of low wages; but it must be recognised that, if these low corn prices continue and no other action is taken, there is a serious danger that considerable areas of land will go out of cultivation. This can probably be prevented by the adoption of new methods of farming aiming -at the highest-production per man. Such a change of methods would take some years to carry through on a great scale.136. But before any practical conclusion can be drawn, it is necessary to bear in mind two important considerations. In the first place, it is very difficult to ensure that measures of assistance which are temporary in intention will not prove permanent in fact. In the second place, as we have endeavoured to show, agriculture, or corn-growing, is by no means alone in having to face an extremely difficult situation; its misfortunes are common to a large range of unsheltered occupations. Having regard to these two considerations, we cannot recommend a policy which would place agriculture on a peculiar footing and extend to it State assistance which was denied to other depressed basic industries.137. It would be another matter if there were an imminent danger of the general abandonment of the greater part of the culti-vated land to poor grazings, an event which we should regard as a national disaster. Some of us are not satisfied that the present depression has become so acute as to justify the immediate adoption of emergency measures of relief. Others, however, hold that certain districts have already reached a crisis. All of us are agreed that special relief, if any, should not take the form of an unconditional grant to the farmers, but should be given in such a way as to encourage re-organisation and the adaptation of farming methods to the new relation between wages and prices.(c.) Claim to assistance in relation to other industries.138. We hold not less strongly that, if exceptional measures, whether permanent or temporary, involving a departure from our traditional economic policy, should be contemplated for the assistance cf other industries, agriculture has at least as strong a claim as any other.[21Q61]
IX SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS.139.   We summarise our principal conclusions as follows : (i) There has been no decline in the total volume of the output output? 0f    of agriculture in Great Britain between the pre-war and post-war period.Such decline as has occurred has been most marked in farm crops and livestock, but it has been offset by increases mainly in dairy produce, poultry and eggs.Acreage.(ii) The arable area expanded between 1908 and 1918 by over 1,000,000 acres, but contracted between 1918 and 1929 by nearly 3,000,000 acres.. (iii) Agricultural employment has shown a continuous decline forcultural em- near!v sixty years. Since 1921, there has been a loss of employment ployment.     of about 108,000 men and women.Extent and character of the present depression.Causes of the present depression.Causes of the special decline in the prices of arable crops.(iv) Serious agricultural depression to-day only affects part of the country and some branches of farming. More than half the country is in a satisfactory or fairly satisfactory condition, and the area in which there is severe depression amounts to about one-tenth of the whole.Conditions on the farms have been, generally, worse the higher the proportion of income derived from the sale of cereals. The value of the total cereals sold off farms in Great Britain amounts to 9 per cent., and wheat to Z per cent., of the total agricultural output. Conditions are particularly bad on farms situated in East Anglia on heavy clay or on infertile light land, which will not grow good per-manent grass.(v) The outstanding general cause of the present agricultural depression has been the general fall in prices since the autumn of 1920. The prices of cereals have fallen faster than agricultural prices as a whole, particularly in recent months.The average level of wages in England and Wales rose in 1925, after the passing of the Agricultural Wages (Regulation) Act, 1924, and has remained practically stationary since that date. There hz% also been a rise in wages in Scotland.Wages are a large item in farming costs, varying from 30 per cent, to 40 per cent, in arable farming and in intensive dairying, down to 20 per cent, or less in other branches. Arable farming has, therefore, suffered more than any other types of farming by reason of the rise in wages, at a time when prices were falling.(vi) The &quot;dumping&quot; of wheat by Germany and other conti-nental countries has been a relatively unimportant factor in depres-sing its price during the years under review. The action of European countries in progressively raising their tariffs against the importation of wheat has been a more serious factor.The main cause of the exceptional fall in the price of wheit is to be found in the progressive increase in recent years of the world area under cultivation and in the record harvest of 1928.The &quot;dumping&quot; of oats has been more extensive than th?.t of wheat, but the fall in the price of oats (and in that of barley) has been largely due to the influence on the market of wheat supplies and feeding stuffs which are to some extent alternatives.Comparison of position of agricul-ture with that of other unsheltered industries and the effect of imports on the foreign exchange.(vii) From the economic standpoint, the problem of agriculture is part of the larger problem of the depression of the unsheltered industries, and there is no clear &quot; economic &quot; ground for singling out agriculture, as a whole, as a peculiarly strong claimant for special assistance.For the sake of the foreign exchanges, there would be some advantage in reducing the volume of imports and thus making the balance of trade less unfavourable, but agriculture can put forward
no claim for assistance on these grounds that cannot be put forward with equal force by manufacturing industries which are exposed to foreign competition in the home market.(viii) There are undoubted advantages to the general health of the nation in maintaining an agricultural population, but since less than 7 per cent, of the occupied population is engaged in agriculture, this advantage, when spread over the whole country, is slight. No special State assistance to agriculture would be justified for reasons of national health.Special measures of assistance to agriculture, as an insurance against difficulties in the event of war, would not be justified in present conditions.There are three objects to which a national agricultural policy might be directed: high wages, high employment, high volume of production. The enactment of the Agricultural Wages (Regulation) Act of 1924 was a definite decision on the part of the country to adopt a policy of higher wages than in the past. As a result of this Act, money wages were increased in England and Wales and have since remained more or less stationary. The decrease in retail prices has, therefore, meant a steady rise of real wages.But the policies of higher wages and high employment are mutually conflicting. Higher wages reduce employment both by causing arable land to ba put down to grass, and by encouraging the use of labour-saving methods. To sum up, output has been main-tained since 1908, but employment has declined by 11 per cent.What is important from the national point of view is the mainten-ance of a high volume of agricultural production and of good wages and of a national agricultural industry sufficiently profitable to pay them. We hold that the wage policy adopted by the Government is the right one, and the steps inevitably taken by the farmers to meet the situation so created by employing fewer men are also right. The reduction in employment which, for these reasons, has taken place, must therefore be regarded as inevitable.(ix) Since the War, it has been generally realised that organised marketing in agriculture is of the first importance, and that it is a field in which State help and guidance is particularly valuable. It cannot be expected that the reform of marketing can be effected so quickly as to provide a remedy for the immediate situation. But, taking a long view, it is clear that radical changes in our marketing system are needed, that the ultra-individualistic marketing methods of the farmer must be drastically changed, and that successful development on these lines would bring advantages of great and far-reaching importance to British agriculture.There are certain forms of the farming business which are indepen- (b) General dent of the cultivation of the land, and are, therefore, capable of an ^^&quot;tVui expansion which is not limited by the amount of land available.  The farming production of pigs, for example, resembles a manufacturing process practice, by which materials like barley-meal and milling offals are converted into meat   The production of eggs and poultry is a process of a similar kind.    The value of imported pig-products amounts to  60,000,000 per annum and poultry-products  23,000,000.  Much of this might be captured by improved production and marketing.We have not entered into a general discussion on the importance of small holdings in agricultural economy; but we are agreed that they do not provide a remedy for the depression prevailing in the distressed areas. The value of family farms and their capacity of resistance to falling prices depends on the willingness of their occupiers to give; their labour below the current rates of pay. The social value of family farms is, however, great. Amongst other things, they afford oppor-tunities of recruitment to the farming business, but they must maintain themselves by taking advantage of the specialised industries like pig and poultry keeping, or vegetable growing rather than the cultivation of staple crops.[21261] aNational importance of agricul-tUBS.Extent to which the position of British agriculture can be improved by normal methods, (a) Mar-keting Reform.
During the fall in prices, the main change in practice adopted by farmers has been the laying down of arable land to grass. Physical conditions, however, place a limit upon the land which can be con-verted from arable to good pasture. The right course for land of this kind lies in the continuation of arable cultivation and at present, at all events, corn must be the mainstay over most of the area.The British farming system, which has had as its technical objec-tive high production per acre, has, during the last half century, come increasingly into competition with the systems in overseas countries, which have as their objective, high production per man.The technique of the nineteenth century built up upon cheap labour must give place to a new technique. Farmers in Great Britain to-day must face the conditions which farmers in some of the great overseas producing countries had to face in the past.Having regard to these considerations, the &quot; long range &quot; problem for corn growing in this country, as apart from the improvement of marketing, is a change in the method of cultivation.We have not been asked, nor are we competent to say, in detail, how British farming should reform its technique, but we do not believe that farming alone of the great industries of the country is not susceptible to rationalisation. When we turn from agriculture to other forms of industry, we see on every side the rationalisation of production being urged forward as a means of overcoming difficulties similar to those from which agriculture is suffering to-day. For these reasons we cannot accept the contention, either that re-organisation of farming practice is impossible, or that the State, by guaranteeing farm prices, should make it unnecessary.We are satisfied that much can be done by adapting farming methods to the new conditions. Individual farmers are doing this with success even in the depressed areas. It is of the utmost import-ance that the Government should continue the help which it is already giving, especially in the furtherance of economic research into methods of cultivation and farm management.(c) The special position of cereal farming.Is there a case for subsidies or other ab-normal methods of help to agri-culture ?(a) Per-manentassistance.(b) Tempo-rary assist-ance.It should, in our opinion, be a cardinal principle of agricultural policy that it is the first business of a farmer to make his farm pay in the existing conditions of world markets, and measures adopted by the State should promote and not retard economic progress in farming.Secondly, we would emphasise the fact that other unsheltered industries are suffering from depression, in some cases even more severe than that of farming.We are convinced that permanent Government assistance in the form of guaranteed prices or acreage subsidies, which would make it easier to continue obsolete methods, should not be given. Any assistance accorded should be directed to furthering the adoption of improved methods of production and distribution.We cannot recommend a policy which would place agriculture on a peculiar footing and extend to it State assistance which is denied to other depressed basic industries. It would be another matter if there were an imminent danger of the general abandonment of the greater part of the cultivated land to poor grazings, an event which we should regard as a national disaster.

Others, however, hold that certain districts have already reached a crisis. All of us are agreed that special relief, if any, should not take the form of an unconditional grant to
the farmers, but should be given in such a way as to encourage re-organisation and the adaptation of farming methods to the new relation between wages and prices.We hold not less strongly that, if exceptional measures, whether permanent or temporary, involving a departure from our traditional economic policy, should be contemplated for the assistance of other industries, agriculture has at least as strong a claim as any other.(c) Claim for assist-ance in relation to other industries.(Signed)       ED.
