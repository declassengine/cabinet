iThis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   November 193.1.MOST SECRET.CP. 285 (31).CABINET.North-West Frontier Province-Constitution.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.In Appendix A to my Memorandum R.T.C. (31) 11 (circulated with CP. 272 (31)), I made certain proposals for a declaration of intention as regards the Constitution of the North-West Frontier Province. Since this was written the telegrams attached to this note have been exchanged with the Government of India.2. The Muslim demand has also been stated in the folloAving terms in the &quot;Minorities Pact &quot; :-&quot; The North-West Frontier Province shall, be constituted a Governors Province on the same footing as other Provinces, with due regard to the necessary requirements of the Frontier.&quot;In the formation of the Provincial Legislature the nominations shall not exceed more than 10 per cent, of the whole.&quot;3. The Government of India are satisfied that, in general, the proposals of the Sub-Committee of the last Conference as elaborated by the Haig Committee will not prejudice the security of the Province or endanger military interests. It would, therefore, be safe to say, as already proposed, that the Province will have the status oi a Governors Province with a Constitution framed on the lines indicated by the Sub-Committee of the last Conference as elaborated by the subsequent Committee.1. The Government of India, however, propose that an important change should be made in the formal position of Ministers as defined in the Sub-Committee&apos;s Report, and consequently in the statement of the powers of the Governor. The constitutional position, as left by the Sub-Committee, was that the Ministers would be merely assistants whose advice could be overruled hy the GoA^ernor on any occasion, and consequently that they would be without any formal responsibility. The Government of India propose that the Ministers should be responsible advisers, just as Ministers in other Provinces, and consequently that the powers of the Governor to overrule them, instead of being general, should be limited to certain specific purposes, in addition of course to the powers which the Governors of all Provinces would enjoy. The political value of stating the relations between the Ministers and the Governor on the lines proposed by the Government of India is undoubted, and if in practice this system will give the Governor all the powers he would want to use under the system proposed by the Sub-Committee, it might be preferable to adopt it. The whole case, however, requires careful, detailed examination for which time is not available before the declaration of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and it is undesirable to attempt in this declaration any elaborate definition of the constitutional position in the North-West Frontier Province or to indicate any departure from the recommendations of Sub-Committee V. It is therefore suggested that the declaration should be of a general character, making use of some of the words proposed in the Minorities Pact, and that the details of the position of the Ministers and the special powers of the Governor should be worked out in the course of the further discussions on the provincial constitutions. The actual formula I suggest is the following : -&quot;The North-West Frontier Province should be constituted a GovernoFs Province, of the same status as other Governors&apos; Provinces, due regard being had to the necessary requirements of the Frontier. It is intended, of course, that in the North-West Frontier Province, as indeed in all other Governors&apos; Provinces, the powers entrusted to the Governor to safeguard the safety and tranquillity of the Province shall be real and effective.&quot;S.

Telegram from Secretary of State to Government of India, dated 7th November 1931.3238. Reforms Department. Your Secretary^ letter dated 10th August, No. 54. Muslims here are pressing for a declaration at the eud of the Conference as to our attitude regarding reforms for North-West Frontier Province. It is represented that no indication has been given of Government views on Haig Committee Report, and continued silence will arouse suspicions of our intentious. It is further suggested that a general affirmation of iuteution to introduce a constitution framed on lines proposed would attract support of all reasonable Muslim opinion in Province, and would help towards disintegration of Red Shirt movement. It seems unlikely that His Majesty&apos;s Government will be able to avoid some fairly definite commitment before the eud of the Conference. The claim likely to emerge is that settled districts should be constituted a Governors Province, with the same statins as the other Provinces of India, and with a constitution and financial settlement framed on the lines indicated by the Sub-Committee of the last Conference, as elaborated by Haig- Committee. Please telegraph your views on this as soon as possible from point of view both of general policy and administrative security.Telegram from Government of India, Reforms Department, to Secretary of State forIndia, dated 14t/i November 1931.2795 S. Reforms Office. Your telegram of the 7th instant, 3238. We agree that at the end of the Conference a declaration should be made by His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to a constitution for the North-West Frontier Province.We accept generally the proposal of Sub-Committee V, including the composition of the Legislature and selection of non-official Ministers only. We also accept generally the elaborations generalised by the Haig Committee, subject to what follows in paras. G and 7.3. We interpret Sub-Committee V&apos;s proposals regarding the iDosition of the GoArernor as effective head of the administration and as being merely7 assisted by the advice of the Ministers to mean that the Governor will be able, at his discretion, to overrule the advice of the Ministers and the Legislature in all or any branch of the administration, or on such grounds as he may think fit. If this states the position correctly, then the Ministers will have no effective ministerial responsibility, and their position will be merely that of advisory7 assistants. When the implications of such a constitution are realised there will be immediate agitation in the North-West Frontier Province and among Muslims throughout India, who will feel that they7 have been defrauded of the expectations which they have been encouraged to entertain. In particular, it would be realised that this Constitution compares most favourably (sic) not only with the other Provinces, but also with the present position of Ministers in the dy7archical Constitutions. Apart from the general agitation, a situation of great gravity7 might be immediately precipitated in the North-West Frontier Province.4. We consider that the personal powers of the Governor should be those proposed by Sub-Committee II in para. 6 of their report for the Provinces generally and, in addition, overriding powers for the protection of his administration as Agent to the Governor-General for the tribal tracts, whereby ou questions arising in settled districts in which tribal factors are involved he would be competent to make and give effect to final decisions. The powers would be accompanied by suitable legislative and financial powers of similar scope.5. It would follow that, if powers of Governor are defined in this way, Ministers will assume the same constitutional position as in other Provinces, i.e. they will administer portfolios as responsible advisers of the Governor, but they will be liable to have their advice rejected by the Governor on more numerous occasions and for wider purposes than in the other Provinces. The Governor will have the security of the nominated elements in the Legislature, his overriding powers in the administration of legislation and finances aud his presidency of the Cabinet. We recognise that these recommendations involve an important advance upon the proposals of Sub-Committee V as we have interpreted them.6. Haig&apos;s Committee Report regarding classification is under examination. We will communicate later any criticisms we have on points of detail. Generally, the proposals seem to tis to be suitable.7. We accept principle of a subvention from Centre to provincial funds, but cannot at present accept any particular figure or any presumption that subvention at a later date may be increased.   A fuller criticism of financial proposals follows.
8. These observations proceed upon fundamental assumptions : (a) that powers to Governor-General will be adequate, and, in particular, thatthis power of making Ordinances will in no way be commandeered ;(b) that the personal powers to a Governor in a Governors Province to securesafety and tranquillity of his Province will be real and effective. Subject to these assumptions and additional powers of Governor of North-AVest Frontier Province proposed in para. 4 above, we are satisfied that these proposals will not prejudice security of Provinces or general military interests.Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated 14th November 1931.920 S. Private and personal. Your private and personal telegram dated 13th November, 3303.1. Please see Reforms telegram of to-day in reply to your telegram 3238, 7th November. Considered views of the Government of India, in which the Commander-in-Chief concurred, are there fully stated.2. I have again consulted Commander-iu-Chief with reference to your telegram now under reply, and he has given further careful consideration to the questions raised by you. He is satisfied that, provided conditions stated in Reforms telegram are fulfilled, there need be no apprehension that military requirements will be endangered.3. My own view is, it must be remembered, that no constitution, whether already in existence or of which introduction is contemplated, provides or cau provide execution of all measures which military requirements may demand, without assumption of emergency powers.Provided, therefore, that such powers of assumption are carefully safeguarded in the manner indicated in the Reforms telegram above mentioned, and (which is equally fundamental) that general constitutional provisions for any administration are fully secured, both Commander-in-Chief and myself, with the full concurrence of the Members of my Council, are quite prepared to face the risks involved, which we think will be less than those likely to arise from a discontented North-West Frontier Province, with its reactions on Moslems throughout India.
