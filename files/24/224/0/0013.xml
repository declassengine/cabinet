REPORT.I.-INTRODUCTORY, (a) Composition and Terms of Reference.1. On the 26th July, 1929, the Prime Minister appointed a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Civil Eesearch* with the following Terms of Reference: To consider and report upon the present condition and prospects of the Iron and Steel Industries, and to make recommendations as to any action which may appear desirable and practicable in order to improve the position of those Industries in the markets of the world.2.   The Committee is constituted as follows: The Eight Hon. the Lord Sankey, G.B.E., Lord Chancellor (Chairman).The Eight Hon. Thomas Shaw, C.B.E., M.P., Secretaryof State for War. Sir Cecil Budd, K.B.E. Mr. C. T. Cramp.Sir William Plender, Bart., G.B.E.Mr.   A.   F.   Hemming,   CB-E.,^Assistant Secretary, Economic I Joint Secretaries Advisory Council f to the Committee.Mr. W. Palmer, Board of Trade    J(b) Procedure adopted by the Committee.8. On the 31st July, 1929, we held a preliminary meeting for the purpose of laying down the procedure to be followed in our Inquiry. In order to inform ourselves generally of the nature of the problem to be studied, we decided, in the first instance, to obtain preliminary evidence from the organisations representing the employers and the workpeople. We accordingly invited the National Federation of Iron and Steel Manufacturers and the Iron and Steel Trades&apos; Confederation to appoint witnesses to give oral evidence, before us. At the same time, we decided to obtain evidence from bodies representing industries which use steel as a raw material, and accordingly issued invitations to the British Steel Ee-Eollers&apos; Association, the British Engineers&apos; Association and the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation.4. After receiving from the National Federation of Iron and Steel Manufacturers the preliminary evidence referred to in the preceding paragraph, we devoted a series of sessions to hearing evidence in respect of the several sections of the industry, e.g.: The Pig Iron Industry.The Heavy Steel Industry.The Tin Plate Industry.The South Wales Steel Industry.The Ee-Eolling Industry.The Wire, Wire Netting and Wire Nail Industries.The Sheet Industry.The Forgings Section of the Industry.The Wrought Iron Trade.The Crucible Steel Section.The Lincolnshire Steel Industry.The Castings Section.The witnesses who gave this evidence were nominated by the National Federation of Iron and Steel Manufacturers, and came before us as the accredited representatives of their respective sections.* Note.-By Treasury Minute dated January 27, 1930, the Committee of Civil Research was absorbed in the Economic Advisory Council, of which this Sub-Committee became a Committee.[6202] b 2
At the same period, we received evidence from the National Union of Blastfurnacemen, Ore Miners, Coke Workers and Kindred Trades, who gave us the collective views of the workpeople engaged in this section of the industry. Evidence was also submitted to us on behalf of the National Union of General and Municipal Workers.5. At an early stage of our Inquiry it became apparent that if we were adequately to discharge our task it would be necessary to undertake a study of post-war developments in the principal steel-producing countries on the Continent, e.g., France, Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany. In this matter we were greatly assisted by the Department of Overseas Trade, who arranged for evidence to be furnished to us on the Iron and Steel Industry in France by Mr. J. B. Cahill, Commercial Counsellor at the British Embassy at Paris, and on that in Belgium and Luxembourg by Mr. N. S. Reyntiens, Commercial Secretary at the British Embassy at Brussels. As regards the German Iron and Steel Industry, we were fortunate in being able to obtain evidence from Mr. C. J. Kavanagh, who for a number of years after the war held a similar position in Germany.6. Many of the witnesses who appeared before us expressed the opinion that part of the present difficulties of the Iron and Steel Industry in this country was due to the lower labour costs incurred by their Continental rivals. In particular, they stated that British manufacturers were handicapped by reason of the longer hours and lower wages of the labour engaged in comparable works on the Continent. In no case, however, were witnesses in a position to furnish detailed statistical evidence in support of this view. The question appeared to us of such importance that we recommended His Majesty&apos;s Government to arrange for an ad hoc investiga-tion to be undertaken on our behalf. This recommendation was adopted. It is a matter of particular satisfaction to us that it was possible to arrange for the two officers of the Ministry of Labour appointed to carry out this survey to do so jointly with representa-tives of the Iron and Steel Trades Employers&apos; Association and of the Iron and Steel Trades&apos; Confederation, of which, we understand, the former had itself already decided to conduct such an investigation. The countries visited were France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany and Czecho-Slovakia. In addition, a number of works in this country were visited. On the return of the Mission to this country, oral evidence was submitted to us on behalf of the Iron and Steel Trades Employers&apos; Association on this subject.7. At our first meeting, we were informed by the President of the Board of Trade that shortly before leaving office his predecessor had appointed a Committee* under the Chairmanship of Sir Roy Wilson to consider the difficulties which the Steel Industry had recently experienced in respect of the supply of scrap. The Com-mittee had not actually begun its work and Sir Roy Wilson had intimated that, on doctors&apos; orders, he had since been forbidden to undertake this work. At the request of the President of the Board of Trade, we therefore agreed that this special inquiry into scrap should be merged into our larger investigation of the general state of the industry. At the same time, we agreed to confirm the pre-liminary invitations to give evidence which had been issued on behalf of Sir Boy Wilson&apos;s Committee. These witnesses included the Service Departments, the Federated Associations of Scrap Iron, Steel, Metals and Machinery Merchants of Great Britain, the Scottish Steel Scrap Association, certain leading scrap merchants and others. In addition, evidence on this subject was submitted to us by the South Wales Siemens Steel Association on behalf of the National Federation of Iron and Steel Manufacturers.8. The evidence of the witnesses referred to in paragraph 4 above demonstrated that large sums of fresh capital would bo required for the reconstruction of the industry. We therefore thought it proper to consult with the leading Joint Stock Banks in regard to the financial prospects of the industry.   In addition, the* Note. The Terms of Reference proposed for this Committee were as follows : &quot; To inquire into the position in regard to the supply of scrap for steel making in the United Kingdom, and to make recommendations in regard thereto.&quot;
-Governor of the Bank of England at our request gave evidence before us on this subject.9. Finally, -we received evidence on various aspects of our inquiry from a number of leading members of the industry.10. We held twenty-six meetings for the purpose of taking oral evidence. A full list of the witnesses is given in the Appendix to this Report. In addition, we w^ere furnished with memoranda on particular points by the Board of Trade, the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, the Department of Overseas Trade and the Board of Inland Revenue. We also received from various sources a number of other written communications.11. We desire to place on record our indebtedness to all who have assisted us in our Inquiry, whether by giving oral evidence hefore us or by furnishing memoranda.(c) Arrangement of Report.12. In preparing our Report, we have given in some detail an historical survey of the development of the industry (Section II), as we thought that this was desirable for obtaining a balanced view of the present position. Section III is devoted to a consideration of the materials and processes employed in the heavy iron and steel industries. In this Section we discuss the position in regard to raw materials, ore, coke and coal; the situation in regard to the blast furnaces required for the manufacture of pig iron and the degree of efficiency obtained in the steel works and rolling mills of the country.13. The position of the other sections of the Iron and Steel Industries differs in various respects from that in the heavy section, and in Section IV we describe briefly the situation in regard to each&apos;of these sections. Section V deals with the question -of steel scrap to which, as explained in paragraph 7 above, we were invited at the outset of our Inquiry to give special consideration. In Section VI we discuss the question of the wages earned and the hours worked by the labour engaged in the Iron and Steel Industry in this country and in the principal competing countries in Europe. In Section VII we draw a comparison between the -organisation of the British Iron and Step! Industry and that of its Continental competitors. Section VIII is devoted to a consideration of the various remedies that have been suggested to us in evidence and to our views thereon.14. Our principal conclusions and recommendations are summarised in Section IX.II__HISTORICAL SURVEY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEMANUFACTURE OF IRON AND STEEL.(a) Early History of the Industry.15. Although iron and steel have been known for many centuries, it is only within the last two hundred years that methods have been evolved of smelting and working iron and steel in large quantities, in many qualities and at a reasonable cost. Improvements in technique have been rapid and continuous throughout the last hundred years, and there is no reason to suppose that the process of discovery and development has come to an end, though there is to-day no indication of any new technique likely in the near future to revolutionise existing methods of production.16. Blast furnaces are believed to date back to about the year 1500, but the early ones were insignificant in size and depended on charcoal for fuel and water power for driving the blast. The introduction of coke smelting in the 18th century and the use of the steam engine for driving the blast were momentous improvements. Scarcely less important was the introduction of the hot blast (first used by Neilson in 1828), which resulted in a great diminution of fuel consumption. Continuous improvements in blowing power enabled furnaces of increased capacity to be built,
and there have been many recent developments in the utilisation, of the waste gases of blast furnaces. The average production per-furnace in blast in Great Britain doubled during the period of thirty years immediately preceding the war. It amounted to-30,400 tons in 1913. The production per furnace in the more-recent post-war years is substantially greater (43,500 tons in 1927 and 46;200 tons in 1928), but this is partly due to the aggregate output being below the normal and to its being concentrated in the larger and newer furnaces. Some of the largest furnaces in Great Britain can produce 500 tons of pig iron a day, i.e., about 180,000 tons a year.17. Foundries. The invention of the blast furnace led to the development of iron founding or casting. There are no epoch-making inventions to which reference need be made, but there is a steady record of progress in foundry practice and of improve-ment in the quality of the product.18. Wrought Iron Industry. The invention of the puddling: process by Cort in the latter part of the 18th century led to the-development of the bar iron and manufactured iron, or wrought iron, industry. This attained at one period a great development,, but during the past half century it has declined owing to the-relatively heavy cost of producing bar iron compared with that of producing steel. Wrought iron is, however, still used for some purposes, especially where a material is required which resists corrosion or withstands shock.19. Manufacture of Steel. The development of the steel industry was rendered possible by three outstanding inventions: (1) the Bessemer process in 1856; (2) the open hearth process between 1864 and 1867; and (8) the &quot;basic&quot; process of Thomas and Gilchrist in 1879. These discoveries entirely revolutionised the industry by making it possible for the first time to convert pig iron into steel in large quantities and at comparatively low cost. The original Bessemer and open hearth processes were-suitable for the conversion of iron produced from hematite (i.e.y. non-phosphoric ores), but not for that of iron produced from the more common phosphoric ores, since the phosphorus which was-injurious to the quality of the steel could not be eliminated. The discoveries of Thomas and Gilchrist made it possible, by introducing a &quot; basic &quot; lining in the furnace, to eliminate phosphorus from the metal during its conversion into steel, and thus greatly increased the value of earlier inventions. The basic process was of even greater importance to Germany, Luxemburg, Belgium and France, in connection with the exploitation of the great deposits of phosphoric minette ores, than it was to this country. For although British supplies of hematite ores are limited (being-confined to Cumberland and Lancashire) suitable ores can readily be imported in great quantities.20. In this country and to a smaller extent elsewhere the ten-dency for many years past has been for the open hearth process to gain ground at the expense of the Bessemer process. The latter is now only carried on in this country to a limited extent. The open hearth process takes longer than the Bessemer process and is more expensive in fuel, but the steel produced by it is more reliable in quality and the process has the advantage that a much larger pro-portion of scrap metal can be used. There is also a smaller loss of metal in conversion.21. Another tendency in this country has been towards a greater development of the basic process, thus enabling larger use to be made of phosphoric ores. As with the blast furnace so with the Bessemer converter and the open hearth furnace, there has been a tendency to increase the size. Many special types have also been evolved. A recent improvement of importance was described by Mr. B. Talbot in his Presidential xiddress in 1928 to the Iron and Steel Institute. By the introduction in existing or in new open hearth furnaces of auxiliary hearths in which scrap or pig iron can be melted and the liquid metal partially refined while the finished steel is being; produced in the main hearth, the output of steel can be substantially i ncreased.
22. High Grade and Special Steels. The highest quality of -ordinary steel is made in comparatively small quantities by the -crucible process, which dates from the 18th century; and high grade steel of somewhat lower quality is made in electric furnaces, of which many were built in this country during the war. During the last 50 years very important discoveries have been made in regard to alloys of steel and other metals, i.e., the so-called special steels. These possess peculiar qualities or properties which adapt them for -use for particular purposes. They are produced in relatively small quantities and their price is as a rule many times that of ordinary steel. High grade and special steel making are concentrated in -the Sheffield district.(b) Later Developments in Great Britain.23. The geographical position of the heavy branches (i.e., pig iron, wrought iron, steel making and rolling) of the industry has been determined to a great extent by considerations of transport in relation to the assembling of materials and the marketing of the finished product.24. Until less than 200 years ago the primary considerations were the availability of timber for use as fuel and water power for driving the blast. The proximity of iron ore, though important, was less so than the proximity of wood since much more fuel than ore was required. Proximity to markets was also of relatively sub-ordinate importance. The blast furnace industry had its principal centre, until the end of the 17th century, in Sussex, and it was mainly the increasing scarcity of timber which led to its migration to other parts of the country.25.   With the introduction of coke smelting, the blast furnace industry naturally gravitated to the neighbourhood of the coal mines. Districts where ore was won from the same mines as coal offered a special attraction.   Until the introduction of the steam engine, how--ever, the blast furnaces remained dependent upon water power.26. Technical invention during the last century has to a con-siderable extent been connected with the attainment of economy in ;the use of fuel. There has been continuous progress as regards the quantity of ore that can be smelted (and where desired converted into steel) with a given amount of fuel. Changes of this character, in conjunction with improvements in transport facilities, have exer-cised a very considerable influence upon the geographical distribu-tion of the heavy iron and steel industry. They have tended to . diminish the importance of proximity to fuel as compared with the importance of proximity to ore. For a good many years past a smaller weight of coal (converted into coke) than of ore has been required in the blast furnace, the relative quantities being dependent -upon the richness of the ore and the quality of the coal. At the present time the smelting of the ore, the conversion of the pig iron into steel and the rolling of the steel can in suitable circumstances all be carried out with no more expenditure of heat than that generated by the coal required for consumption (after the conversion into coke) in the blast furnace. This result has been obtained by the use of heat recuperating and bye-product recovering coke ovens; by the discovery of methods of cleaning blast furnace gas; and by the introduction of the internal combustion engine. Coke oven and blast furnace gas can now be used to provide the heat necessary for converting pig iron into steel and for generating electricity to drive the rolling mills.27. These developments have exercised a two-fold effect. They have caused (i) a shifting of the industry in the direction of the ore supply;(ii) the concentration in some cases of coking ovens, blastfurnaces, steel works and rolling mills in proximity with one another so that the whole process of manufacture of rolled steel products from the ore can be carried out with a minimum consumption of fuel.

By the year 1913, several districts had become increasingly important as pig iron producers, while other.areas were becoming less important or were approximately stationary. Among the districts increasing in importance the most conspicuous was that of the North-East Coast, the development of which occurred, however, mainly prior to 1900. The industry in that area was based chiefly upon Cleveland ore and Durham coal, but large quantities of rich ores (including hematite ores used to make pig iron for conversion into steel by the original Bessemer and open hearth processes, as-well as phosphoric ores) were imported. As the local ores began to show signs of approaching exhaustion they were supplemented to an increasing extent by Northamptonshire and other British ores, which were found useful for mixing with the richer foreign ores. Bail-freights upon these ores (which were not of high metal content) tended to increase costs of production on the North-East Coast.31. Other districts which showed a marked development were Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire, the West Biding, Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire. These districts are essentially dependent upon British ores, of which great quantities exist in Lincolnshire, Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, Rutland and Oxfordshire. Although these ores are of rather low metal content (ranging from an average of 22 per cent, to an average of 32 per cent.), they are easily worked, and the North Lincolnshire ores in particular, which contain only 22 per cent, of metal, possess the valuable quality of being self-fluxing (i.e., it is not necessary to add limestone to the furnace charge). It is significant that although the pig iron output in all other districts was substantially less in 1927 than in 1913, the production of Lincolnshire (with Leicestershire) was 64 per cent, greater.82. In the Staffordshire district, production on the whole declined during the half century preceding the war and the produc-tion of 1927 was little more than half that of 1913. This area has a relatively large proportion of old and small furnaces. It was an important centre of wrought iron manufacture and has been affected by the decay of that branch of the industry. The falling off of production in Cumberland and Lancashire during the 80 years before28. The shifting of the industry in the direction of the ore supply is particularly noteworthy in connection with the growth of some of the newer iron and steel manufacturing districts which use local ores, e.g., Lincolnshire, and with the growth of the industry on the coast, where plentiful supplies of rich ores can be obtained from abroad.29. In the following table the changes in the geographical distribution of the pig iron industry are traced from 1857 to 1927 : 
the war may probably be attributed to the exhaustion of some of the best deposits of the local hematite ores. It may be noted also that the North-West Coast district is less favourably placed with regard to supplies to good coking coal than the North-East Coast district.88. South Wales is another district which was declining rather than progressing before the war as a producer of pig iron. Local iron ores were always relatively costly to produce, and have long been almost entirely superseded by imported ores. Some of the local iron and steel works, though favourably situated in respect of coal supplies, are less well situated in respect of imported ores which have to be carried some distance by rail. A number of newer blast furnaces, including some of very large capacity, have, however, been established on the coast.84. The Scottish pig iron industry possessed a great advantage so long as it was able to draw its ironstone and fuel from the same mines and to smelt in furnaces established at the pit&apos;s mouth. The local ores have, however, become exhausted, and the supplies of good splint coal which is used in the furnaces in the natural state are growing short. Scotland is also deficient in good coking coal. Conditions have, therefore, tended to become unfavourable to the development of the pig iron industry in Scotland. The furnaces are mostly small and old.35. The figures of pig iron output may be supplemented by figures showing the average output per furnace in blast in the different districts. The output of a furnace depends partly on the richness of the ore and the quality of the coal, and also upon the rate at which the furnace is worked, as well as upon the cubic capacity of the furnace itself. The figures of output nevertheless give some indication of the relative size of furnaces in blast in different districts.Average Output per Blast Furnace in 1927.

It will be seen that the largest outputs were achieved by the furnaces in blast in South Wales, followed by the West Coast, the North-East Coast and Lincolnshire. In the last named county the comparative leanness of the ore smelted tends to reduce the output of the furnaces.87. It may be assumed that the furnaces in blast are on the whole larger and newer than the furnaces idle. The latter, no-doubt, include some which are not likely to be put in blast again. As indicated by the figures given in paragraph 40 below, the number of furnaces in existence has tended to fall for many years past. The decline has latterly been accelerated, and the aggregate number of furnaces in existence in Great Britain has decreased from 485 at the end of 1922 to 424 at the end of 1927, and 410 at the end of 1928, in spite of the erection during that period of a number of new furnaces.38. The tendency for efficient practice to require larger furnaces has, in general, led to an increase in the size of the
business unit measured in terms of capital employed. In the following table are given the number of companies (or individual proprietors) owning blast furnaces in Great Britain, the number of furnaces in existence, and the average number in existence per company or proprietor in each of five selected years of peak production before the war, and Ihese are compared with the corresponding figures for 1924 :-----	Number of Com-panies (or individual proprietors) owning Blast Furnaces.

A further substantial increase has taken place since 1913. This advance is greater than the above figures suggest. If subsidiary companies were eliminated from the figures for 1924, the number of owners would be reduced to at most 79, the average number of blast furnaces under a single control being increased to 6.40. Changes in the relative and absolute importance of different districts as regards steelmaking cannot, in the absence of statistics, be traced back beyond 1913.

Scotland and South Wales in particular, and also Sheffield, are relatively more important in steel making than in pig iron manufacture. This is largely owing to a great local demand for steel from the tinplate and galvanised sheet industries in South Wales, and from the shipbuilding industry on the Clyde, and to the use of a large proportion of steel scrap instead of pig iron (amounting in the case of South Wales to over 70 per cent.) in the steelmaking process. In Lincolnshire, the expansion of pig iron production has its counterpart in a marked expansion of steel production, though the quantity of steel produced both before and since the war is less than the quantity of pig iron. Other features indicated by the table are a marked growth of steel production in the Staffordshire, &amp;c, area and a falling off in the West Coast district.42. Most if not all of the steel producers are also steel rollers, the steel ingots being rolled at the steel works to some more convenient shape such as blooms, billets or bars. Frequently, also, the steel works also include rolling mills for reducing the steel to more highly finished forms, such as girders, joists, plates and rails. In addition, there is a considerable number of rolling mills not attached to steel-producing works.   Firms owning these
works are known as re-rollers, as they buy rolled steel and roll it into other shapes. These firms are the principal buyers of imported semi-finished steel, though some of the works that have steel-producing capacity have since the war found it desirable at times to cease production of steel themselves and to import foreign steel for their rolling mills. The re-rollers are distributed throughout the country, generally in the steelmaking districts.48. The finishing branches of the industry are in general distributed among the iron and steel producing districts. The tube makers are mainly in Scotland, South Wales and the Midlands, the wire makers in the Manchester and Birmingham districts, the galvanised sheet makers in the Midlands and South Wales, and the tinplate makers in South Wales.44. Even before the war there was a tendency towards vertical combination of undertakings in the iron and steel industry by blast furnace owners acquiring control over ore and coal mines, coke ovens and steel furnaces and mills. During the war period and immediately afterwards many large undertakings were formed, mainly by combination of existing independent concerns. The general plan followed was to combine units engaged in the different successive stages of manufacture so that the resulting combination controlled its coal and ore supplies, produced its own pig iron and steel, worked the material up into finished form and had a selling organisation for the disposal of its products. It is estimated that at the present time ten of these groups possess about 47 per cent, of the pig iron capacity and 60 per cent, of the steel capacity of the country. It is also estimated that the pig iron makers control about 70 per cent, of their ore supply and 60 per cent, of the coal and coke supplies.45. In the Armaments Section there has recently been a large amalgamation. The steel-producing interests of Vickers, Limited, Armstrong Whitworth and Company, Limited, and Cammell Laird and Company, Limited, have been combined to form the English Steel Corporation, Limited, the engineering interests of the companies having been separated from the steel interests. This amalgamation differs from those formed during the war, as it embraces a comparatively narrow range of interests. It has steel furnaces and rolling mills, but produces no pig iron.46. A recent amalgamation is that between Messrs. Dorman,. Long &amp; Co., Ltd., and Messrs. Bolckow, Vaughan &amp; Co., Ltd., two of the existing large vertical combinations. The combined undertaking, trading as Messrs. Dorman, Long &amp; Co., Ltd., is easily the largest steel firm in the country and represents a very substantial part of the whole steel trade of the North-East Coast. A recent development in South Wales is the formation of a new company to-take over the ore, coke-oven and iron and steel interests of Messrs. Baldwins, Ltd., and Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds, Ltd. A still more recent amalgamation scheme in Lancashire involves the Wigan Coal and Iron Company, Ltd., Pearson and Knowles Coal and Iron Company, Ltd., Partirigton Steel and Iron Company, Ltd., and Bylands Bros., Ltd. There has also been a development in Scotland where Messrs. David Colville and Sons, Ltd., have taken over the business in heavy rolled material of Messrs. William Beardmore and Sons, Ltd.; the latter firm will in future concentrate on the production of heavy forgings.47. Other reconstructions which have taken place recently include the amalgamation on the North-East Coast of the South Durham Steel and Iron Co., Ltd., and the Cargo Fleet Iron Co., Ltd., which were already closely associated; and the amalgamation in the Glasgow district of eight firms making light castings to form Allied Ironfounders, Ltd.(c) The Growth of Iron and Steel Industries Abroad.48. The iron and steel industry developed on the Continent and in the United States much later than in the United Kingdom but during the present century the growth of the industry in the United States, Germany, France and Belgium has been very rapid.   The
United States steel industry is, in the main, in a different position from that of the rest of the world. It is supplied with materials by its own varied mineral resources and it supplies its own large and expanding market. The rapid growth of the Continental industry dates from the discovery, about 1880, of the basic process of steel making which made possible the use of the plentiful supplies of phosphoric ores in the Lorraine district. Germany now uses, in addition, large quantities of ores from Sweden, Spain and New-foundland. The Continental industry had no advantage over that of this country in regard to coal and this fact probably stimulated the introduction of methods of fuel economy on the Continent.49. The growth in the production of iron and steel in other centres, compared with the United Kingdom, in recent years is shown in the followdng table : World Production of Pig Iron.(Millions of tons.)Years.

Many of the foreign iron and steel industries are much more closely organised than is that of this country. In the United States, the United States Steel Corporation has for many years been responsible for a large proportion of the output of that country, and there are, in addition, other very large producers. In Germany for many years the Stahlwerksverband undoubtedly helped the industry to push its way into the markets of the world. The Stahlwerksver-band was formed as a joint stock company in 1904 with a membership at that time of 31 steel manufacturers. These controlled practically the whole of the German output of so-called &quot;A&quot; products, com-prising semi-finished steel in the form of ingots, slabs, blooms and billets, puddled blooms, railroad supplies (such as rails, ties, fish plates, bolts, spikes, bed plates) and structural steel. Of the so-called &quot;B&quot; products (comprising rods, steel bands, barrel hoops, rolled wire, sheet metal, tinplate, tubes, cast steel railroad axles, steel forgings, steel rollers, etc.) the members of the Verband did not possess a complete monopoly. In 1904 they controlled 88 per cent, of these products, a proportion which rose by 1912 to 95 per cent.51. Members were required to dispose of &quot; A &quot; products only to the Verband, which was thus responsible for selling the whole of the German output of these products, in so far as they were not
used in the production of more highly finished products by the firms that produced them. Production was divided among members on the basis of quotas. &quot;B&quot; products were also regulated as regards output, but they continued to be sold by the undertakings themselves and not by the Verband. As regards &quot; A &quot; products the Stahlwerksverband pursued a systematic policy of dumping abroad at low prices, rather than curtailing production, when demand was slack. This at times led to extremely low prices. To promote the sale of &quot; B &quot; products abroad a system of bounties was introduced intended to compensate undertakings manufacturing such products from purchased &quot; A &quot; products for the higher price which they had to pay in the home market as compared with the price abroad.52. Since the war the Stahlwerksverband has been reeonsti-tuted. The dumping of &quot;A&quot; products has apparently not been revived as a considered policy, but an agreement was reached with the manufacturers of &quot; B &quot; products under which the latter were compensated in respect of exports for the higher price which they had to pay in Germany as compared with the world price for their supplies of &quot; A &quot; products required in producing the goods. This resembled the pre-war arrangement in regard to bounties except that with the disappearance of the dumping of &quot; A &quot; products the differ-ence between German internal prices and world prices has presumably been reduced.53. Continental Steel Cartel. The territorial rearrangements in Europe at the end of the war affected the iron and steel industry to a marked extent, especially by transferring the iron ore resources, blast furnaces and steel plant of Lorraine from Germany to France; and by transferring Luxemburg from the German to the Belgian Customs Union, and the Saar basin (temporarily) from the German to the French Customs Union. At the same time, the iron and steel industry of Continental Europe was generally for some years in a state of depression and it appeared that some general regulation of production might be in the common interest. Under the steel Agreement concluded on the 30th September, 1926, it was provided that the aggregate production of the parties to the agree-ment (viz., the steel industries of Germany, Belgium, France, Luxemburg and the Saar and later also of Czechoslovakia, Austria and Hungary) should be fixed quarterly in advance, and that each participating group should be entitled to contribute a certain per-centage of the total, these percentages being in fact based on actual production during the first quarter of 1926. Participating groups which produced more than their allotted quota were subject to fine, while those who produced less were entitled to compensation.54. With the revival of demand, the aggregate production under the Steel Agreement has been raised and during the greater part of 1928 and 1929 the principal participants were, it is understood, producing up to the full practical capacity of their works. Towards the close of 1929, however, there was a falling off in the demand for iron and steel, in view of which a reduction of 10 per cent, in output was decided on. The results obtained by the Steel Agreement have undoubtedly proved disappointing to those participants who believed that regulation of production would bring about higher prices for iron and steel products. In particular, Ger-many, which accepted a rather low quota in 1926, appears to have &quot;been hampered in some ways by the Agreement, as the German producers incurred continual penalties for overproduction. To meet their complaints the original agreement was modified, particularly by a division of the German quota into two parts; a home consump-tion quota and an export quota. The fine for exceeding the home consumption quota was reduced, and concessions were made as regards the fines for exceeding the export quota. The question of making the international cartel more effective in the interests of all the participants has for some time been under close consideration, and important developments have recently taken place. In the first place more or less informal agreements have been made within the cartel aiming at the maintenance of uniform prices for exports of products such as steel bars. Secondly, an agreement was reached between the principal participating groups for the establishment in February, 1930, of a system of export bureaux, with the object o*
sharing out the export trade in certain products both internationally - as between the groups and among the members in each group.55. The British steel industry has not hitherto participated in the Agreement. It is understood that the quota offered was smaller than was acceptable to British manufacturers.56. Complete amalgamation of interests has also been carried further on the Continent than here. In 1926 there was formed in Germany a very large combination of existing steel interests, called the Vereinigte Stahlwerke A.G., which controls about 40 per cent, of the steel production of the country. In Belgium and France also-large concerns have been formed by amalgamation.57. Apart from the rapid increase in production in the more important centres, there has been a growth in the iron and steel industry in some of the newer centres. Thus, India and Japan are now substantial producers of iron and steel, Canada&apos;s production is-increasing, and persistent efforts are being made to establish iron and steel industries in Australia and South Africa.(d) The More Recent History of the British Iron and Steel Industry.58. It will be seen from the table given in paragraph 49 that although world production of pig iron in 1928 was nearly 25 per cent, above the average production immediately before the war, the United Kingdom production had in the same period decreased by about 31 per cent. World steel production increased by about 64 per cent, and United Kingdom steel production by about 25 per cent.59. The decline in pig iron production in the United Kingdom is largely due to a decrease in exports of pig iron and to the increased use of scrap in steelmaking. In recent years steel has largely replaced wrought iron for many purposes, and a part of the increased production of steel is due to this cause. In spite of this, the increase in steel production in the United Kingdom has been relatively small. One important cause is the increased importation of steel products,, particularly raw and semi-finished steel, and other causes are the absence of expansion of home consumption and of exports. Restricted home consumption is to be attributed largely to the depression in the shipbuilding and engineering industries. British export trade has not expanded because this country now meets with more severe competition from the other exporting countries and from the domestic iron and steel industries that have been estab-lished in many overseas markets.60. The recent difficulties of the industry are not, however,, confined to the reduction in the volume of the trade. In order tc-maintain production, even at the level of recent years, prices have been reduced to such a level that many companies have, made little or no profit and the resources of the industry have been greatly reduced during the period.61. There has also been much unemployment in recent years in the industry. There are about 400,000 insured persons in the different branches of the trade and of these about 60,000 to 70,000 have been unemployed for some years.62. During 1929, there was some improvement in the condition of the industry. The first signs of this change were visible at the beginning of that year and the improvement continued throughout the year. The increased consumption of steel by the shipbuilding industry was probably the most important single cause of the improvement. There was also some tendency to an increase in Continental prices, which in the early part of 1929 were nearer to British prices than they had been for some time; Continental prices were reduced again, however, in the autumn of 1929. In addition the industry has since 1st December, 1928, obtained some relief from railway charges. The railway freight rebate scheme provided, in anticipation of the general derating scheme, for a rebate of l\d. a ton and 25 per cent, of the remainder of the charges on coal and coke consigned to iron and steel works, and of 10 per cent, of the carriage charges on iron ore and limestone for iron and steel works. It is estimated that these rebates are equivalent on the average to about 2/- to 2/8cL a ton of finished steel.

The average number in 1928 was 132, but 170 furnaces were in blast in August 1929. The figures for 1930 are less satis-faetory and only 151 furnaces were in blast in April in 1930.64. There was also some improvement in foreign trade in 1928 and 1929.   Exports increased and imports were lower.Imports and Exports of Iron and Steel and Manufactures thereof.Imports.Exports.1927 1928 1929Tons. 4,406,089 2,897,240 2,816,657 34,032,026 24,147,792 24,669,929Tons.	 4,196,206	69,383,4164,260,462	66,789,1844,379,405	6S,019,805The figures for 1930 are again less satisfactory. Imports for the first three months amounted to 850,004 tons, compared with 586,409 tons in the corresponding period in 1929 and 842,365 tons in 1928. For the same periods, exports were 983,847 tons in 1930, 1,151,404 tons in 1929 and 1,058,573 tons in 1928.65. It will be observed that the increase in the tonnage of exports since 1927 has not been accompanied by an increase in their value. Iron and steel prices were relatively high during the early months of 1927 when the effect of the coal stoppage were still being felt.(a) Foreign Competition.66.

Both before the war and in recent years the bulk of steel imports have consisted of semi-manufactured material which goe? through further stages of manufacture in the iron and steel industry in this country. The imported pig iron is used by the foundry trade-in making castings and to some extent in steel making; the steel blooms, billets and slabs may be rolled down into structural steel, wire rods, hoops and strips, rails, &amp;c.; the steel bars and tinplate bars are the raw material for the galvanised sheet, tinplate and back-plate industries; the iron and steel bars and angles, &amp;c, are used in structural work and in making a range of articles such as bolts and nuts; and the strips are used for making tubes. Most of the-increase in imports consists of goods of this kind though there have been increases in imports of plates and sheets (probably largely plates for shipbuilding and boiler making), in structural steel, in tubes and pipes, in wire and in wire nails.69. These imports come almost wholly from the nearer Con-continental countries. Belgium, the largest exporter to the United Kingdom, sent 1,445,000 tons in 1928. The next in order are France and Germany, each of which exported 410,000 tons. Con-continental iron and steel of these kinds has been much cheaper than the British material. This may be due to some extent to higher efficiency of some of the Continental plants, but the much lower wages and freight charges on the Continent are asserted by British-makers to be more important factors.70. The prices of iron and steel products have been low for many years; in January 1930 the index figure of wholesale prices showed an increase of 81 per cent, above 1913 for all commodities, but an increase of only 15&apos;2 per cent, for iron and steel.71. The export trade is shown in greater detail in the following: table :

Exports consist to a much larger extent than imports of goods which are ready for use by the consumer or by other industries. By far the largest item, plates and sheets, includes black plates for boiler making, motor body building, &amp;c, tin plates and galvanised sheets. Exports of each of these three classes of plates and sheets show a substantial improvement over the years before the war. In railway material, structural material, and tubes, this country has approximately maintained its pre-war position.73. There has, however, been a heavy decline in the export of pig iron and ferro-alloys. Of the 1,039,000 tons of pig iron exported annually before the war, about 800,OOQ tons consisted of forge and foundry iron, which went to the Continental manufacturing countries as well as to Japan and the Dominions. Before the war British pig iron was cheaper than the Continental pig iron, but during recent years this advantage has been much reduced, and has, at times, entirely disappeared. There has also been an increase in blast furnace capacity on the Continent, and the Japanese market has been lost to the new iron industries in India and China.74. The decline in the exports of ferro-alloys is in the main due to a decrease in the trade in ferro-manganese with the United States, which imposed very heavy duties on this material after the war. The fall in exports of iron bars has been counterbalanced by an increase in exports of steel bars, steel having largely replaced wrought iron for this purpose.(f) Recent Efforts for the Improvement of the Industry in Great Britain.75. We have already described (paragraphs 44-47) the efforts that have been made by the Industry to improve their competitive position by the formation of larger manufacturing units through the amalgamation of existing concerns.76. Other efforts having the same object include a number of marketing arrangements of restricted scope which have been made with branches of the Continental and United States industries. The International Railmakers&apos; Association, including British, Continental and United States interests, is a revival of a pre-war association, and involves a division of markets and a fixing of-    [6202] d
prices for steel rails. The international Tube Makers&apos; Association is a similar association between the tube producers in the same countries, and covers certain classes of pipes and tubes. An agreement has also been made between the British and the United States tinplate trades for a division of the export trade.77. The trade, or members of it, have made various other joint efforts to improve the position, mainly under the auspices of the National Federation of Iron and Steel Manufacturers, an association which is fully representative of the trade and deals with all subjects of general interest other than wages and hours. - A scheme has now been in force for some time whereby a rebate from the usual list price is granted by certain associated steel makers to shipbuilders and engineers who during a definite period under-take to buy only British steel. It is believed that this scheme has been successful in increasing the proportion of British material used by shipbuilders. Another co-operative effort by steel makers aims at increasing the export trade. It is understood that the procedure under this scheme is for the associated steel makers to arrange to tender for a foreign contract at a price which it is thought will meet foreign competition, to allot the contract to the works best fitted to carry it out, and to share between them any loss that may be incurred. The steel makers concerned in this scheme recently sent a representative to Canada to investigate the possibility of an increase, in export of steel to that country under these arrangements. A still more recent development, which presumably supersedes the arrangements last referred to, is the formation of a central selling agency which controls the export trade in sections, girders and heavy plates of nearly the whole of the industry.78. A good deal of work is also being done in the direction of increasing the use of steel. The prosperity of the iron and steel trade is of great importance to the railways, and the railway companies have undertaken to make more extended trials of steel sleepers, and to use, wherever practicable, steel instead of wood in the construction of coaches and waggons. The steel makers and the structural engineers have recently formed an association (the British Steelwork Association) to undertake research into the problems conrfected with steel structural work, and to conduct propaganda regarding the use of steel for such purposes. In addition, the use of steel pit props is being slowly extended.79. The Industry have also devoted considerable attention to the prosecution of research. For some years a Fuel Economy Committee connected with the National Federation of Iron and Steel Manufacturers has been at work on problems connected with the use of fuel in the industry, and recently this work has been put on a wider basis by the formation of a Research Council. The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research is making a grant for this work. It is proposed now to investigate thoroughly other aspects of iron and steel manufacture such as steel making and rolling mill practice.80. Finally, a special form of assistance was granted to the Industry by Parliament under the de-rating scheme. As from the 1st October, 1929, iron and steel manufacturers have benefited in common with other manufacturers by the relief of three-quarters of their local rates. In addition the rating relief of the railways is being devoted to a reduction of the freight charges on certain selected traffics including coal and coke, iron ore and limestone for iron and steel works. This reduction in railway charges has been in operation since the 1st December, 1928. It has been estimated that on the average the rate relief on coal, ore and limestone mines, coke ovens, iron and steel furnaces and mills will be equivalent to about 8/- a ton of finished steel and as already stated (paragraph 62) that the railway freight rebates are equivalent to about 2/- to 2/8 a ton of finished steel. In cases where steel makers own their own mines and coke ovens it can be assumed that they obtain the whole benefit of these reductions.
(g) Inquiries into the Industry.(i) Board of Trade Committee, 1916-17.81. The situation arising from the growth of foreign competi-tion was examined in 1916-17 by a Committee, consisting of persons connected with the industry, which was appointed by the Board of Trade &apos;&apos; to consider the position of the Iron and Steel Trades after the War, especially in relation to international competition, and to report what measures, if any, are necessary or desirable in order to safeguard that position.&apos;&apos; The principal findings and recommenda-tions of the Committee inay be summarised briefly as under : 82. Iron Ore. -The Committee recommended that an organisa-tion be formed comprising users of iron ore, and others interested in and essential to the conduct of the trade, to undertake the import and distribution of foreign ores in Great Britain and acquire interests in ore properties abroad, and that such organisation should receive Government financial assistance as necessary. This recommendation has not been carried out. Proposals for collective purchase of ore have been discussed, but it is said that members would have to commit themselves to the purchase of a more or less definite quantity of ore over a period of years and this they were not prepared to do in existing conditions. It may be noted, however, that British pig-iron manufacturers control their ore supply in this country or abroad to the extent of about 72 per cent, of their requirements.83. Export Sales Association. The Committee recommended that iron and steel manufacturers should associate themselves for the purposes of export trade and should form common selling organisations by the extension and consolidation of Associations which already exist. The Committee recommended an organisation divided into groups, each dealing with specific products, the organisation as a whole to be able to handle the entire output of the country.84. In 1928 a Steel Export Selling Association was formed comprising most steel manufacturers producing for export, for the purpose of discovering new markets. We understand that some success was attained. The orders booked were divided among the members. More recently a Central Selling Agency controlling substantially all our exports of heavy plates, girders, and sections has been formed.85. New Plant. The Committee were of opinion that to organise upon modern lines the iron and steel production of Great Britain demanded a radical reconstruction of the commercial and industrial system and that the British industry should raise itself to a point of productiveness and efficiency at which it would bear comparison with its competitors in Germany and America. With one dissentient member, they were of opinion that the steel production of the country must be raised to 15,000,000 ingot tons per year. Complete new units, blast furnaces, coke ovens, steel furnaces and rolling mills must be laid down. The plants must have a minimum capacity of 300,000 tons per annum in order to work economically. The Committee consequently recommended that the British iron and steel manufacturers should be urged to form combinations for the purpose of laying down large and well-designed new units for cheap production upon modern lines. The companies formed to build and work these plants should, if necessary, receive financial aid from the Government, especially in view of the high cost of laying down large plants at that time (1917).86. Protection. A Majority of the Committee recommended the enactment of anti-dumping legislation and merchandise marks legislation; co-ordination of the economic policy of the United Kingdom and the British Empire: the imposition of duties upon imported iron and steel, and the establishment of a system under which foreign syndicates and their representatives should carry on commercial and industrial activities in the United Kingdom only under licence from the Government.
87. Royalties and Wayleaves. The Committee reported that &quot;&apos; drastic revision of the general system of royalty and wayleave rents is urgently called for.&quot; Generally, the Committee favoured an extension of the principle of arbitration to the settlement or revision of royalty and wayleave rents and the setting up of local courts of arbitration. The Committee also emphasised the necessity of Governmental action to encourage the search for and exploitation of those minerals which remain undiscovered in the United Kingdom.88. -It may be noted that this question was also considered by the Committee on the Acquisition for Public Purposes of Bights and Powers in connection with Mines and Minerals (see Third Report, Cmd. 156 of 1919). The Committee recommended that a Sanctioning Authority (composed of members of both Houses of Parliament and others) be created, which would have power to make Orders for the compulsory acquisition or working of minerals, or of rights in, over or under land, affecting the working of such minerals. The Authority would be able to deal with applications for compulsory orders for wayleaves, both above and below ground, and where the terms of a mining lease hamper the development of minerals to revise the terms of the lease.(ii) Committee on Industry and Trade.89. The Committee on Industry and Trade, of which Sir Arthur Balfour was Chairman, and which was appointed in 1924, issued in 1928 a Survey of the Metal Industries, of which one chapter was devoted to the iron and steel industry. In their final report the&apos; Committee referred to the position of the industry as follows (Cmd. 3282, pp. 185, 186) :-&apos;&apos; The situation in the iron and steel industry was described in our &apos; Survey of Metal Industries.&apos; As there shown, British practice in the manufacture of iron and steel tended over a period of years before the war to fall behind continental practice. The problem of keeping up to date was no doubt in some respects more difficult in a country where the iron and steel industry had grown to full stature in an earlier generation than in countries which were establishing the industry for the first time on a large scale, since the latter had not to contemplate the demolition of existing plant and naturally built their new plant to the most modern designs. On the other hand, British undertakings which had built up adequate reserve funds during earlier years should have had no serious difficulty in financing the renewal of their plant.&quot;As explained above, the war-time extensions and improve-ments in the industry did not completely modernise it, and, owing to the extensive re-construction effected in the iron and steel plants of Germany and other continental countries, the average British practice probably remained behind the average conti-nental practice. Much has been done by British iron and steel manufacturers since the war to improve their practice, and the industry is undoubtedly far more efficient than it was ten years ago. But it is doubtful whether British practice has improved as rapidly since the close of the war as that of some of our principal competitors. Hence the need for modernising British iron and steel plant has become more pressing.&apos;&apos; The very great increase in world productive capacity which took place during and immediately after the war was unfortunate-nately not balanced by a corresponding growth of demand, with the result that the industry has been unremunerative. Although, even during the depression, there has been a not inconsiderable expenditure of capital on improvements in this country where this appeared likely to be clearly and immediately remunerative, the companies have not attempted (and doubtless in most cases have not possessed the credit) to carry out thorough reconstruc-tion. As shown in our &apos; Survey of Metal Industries &apos; (pp. 43-5), many of them are already heavily burdened by interest charges on debentures raised since the end of the war.
&apos;&apos; No doubt the economic condition of the industry may be expected to improve as the demand for steel recovers, and as the price of foreign steel rises to the level of British steel. If this happens the prospect of a reasonable profit may be expected to make conditions more favourable for the investment of capital in the re-equipment of the industry. It is obvious, however, that in many undertakings drastic financial reorganisation will be required for the restoration of borrowing power. In the case of some of the less efficient undertakings, moreover, amalgamation with stronger units or groups may be essential, production being concentrated in the more efficient plants and the sales organisa-tion and general administration being strengthened.&quot;(hi) Applications for Safeguarding Duties.90. An application was made to the Board of Trade in June 1925 on behalf of representative organisations in the iron and steel industry for an inquiry under the Safeguarding of Industries procedure with a view to the imposition of a duty on pig iron, wrought iron, heavy steel products and wire, wire netting and woven wire. This application was considered by the Committee of Civil Research. In December 1925, after the Committee had finished its investigation, the then Prime Minister (Mr. Baldwin) announced in the House of Commons that, had the Government been able to deal with the iron and steel industry in isolation, they might have regarded the case for inquiry under the Safeguarding of Industries procedure as complete, but that it had become clear that the safeguarding of a basic ^industry of this magnitude would have repercussions of a far wider character which might have been held to be in conflict with the Government&apos;s declaration in regard to a general tariff. They had, therefore, come to the conclusion that the application could not be granted. Subsequently separate applications made early in 1926 on behalf of the iron and steel wire industry, the steel joist industry and the wire netting and woven wire industry were rejected on the ground that the decision of the Government on the general applications from the industry covered any applications from sections of the industry. The main application was renewed in 1927, but was rejected by reference to the original decision. An application under the Safeguarding of Industries procedure received in February 1925, and renewed in 1927 and 1929, in respect of the wire nail and shoe rivet industries, was rejected by the Board of Trade on the ground that the industry was not of substantial importance, and that (in the case of wire nails) abnormal competition was not proved.(iv) Other Recent Applications for Inquiries.91. In August 1928 the Executive Council of the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation appointed a sub-committee to inquire into the condition of the Iron and Steel Industry, and particularly the question of safeguarding. The Sub-Committee recommended that the Confederation should direct the attention of the Labour Party &quot; to the imperative need, without further delay, of a full and impartial inquiry into the Industry by a competent and representative Committee set up for that purpose, which Committee shall have the necessary power conferred upon it to ascertain as far as possible all the facts with regard to the present position of the industry, with special reference to the nature of the competition in the home market, and to make such recommendations  -tions whether as regards action by the industry itself or legislative action as in the considered judgment of the Committee the circumstances require, due regard being paid to all legitimate interests.&quot;92. Following this recommendation, the Iron and Steel Trade Confederation at the close of 1928 requested the Government to appoint a Royal Commission to investigate the troubles of the
industry. This request was refused in a letter from Mr. Baldwin dated the 8th February, 1929, on the ground that it was not required either to supply information not otherwise available or as a necessary preliminary to effective action.98. After the General Election in 1929, the position of the Iron and Steel Industry was further considered, and His Majesty&apos;s Government in July of that year constituted the present Inquiry as a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Civil Besearch. In January 1930 the latter body was absorbed by the Economic Advisory Council, of which this Sub-Committee became a Committee.Ill-MATERIALS AND PROCESSES IN THE HEAVY IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRIES.(a) -Raw. Materials.94. Great Britain has great natural advantages in regard to the two main materials for steel-making, viz., coal and iron ore. Supplies of suitable coking coal are still abundant. Some of the ore fields in this country are now exhausted, but others have been developed and adequate supplies of suitable foreign ores are also available. Some steel Companies have interests in foreign ore mines; others buy on the open market. Ore is, we understand, generally bought for the British industry on short-term contracts of (say) not more than two or three years. In Germany contracts are, however, made for ten or more years ahead. This difference of policy is due to the fact that the British steel makers individually do not feel sufficient confidence in the future to enable them to enter into long-term contracts. Efforts are, however, being made to form a central ore-buying organisation for the whole industry. Such an organisation should be of definite advantage in enabling the industry to obtain assured supplies on more favourable terms.95. Several iron and steel makers have suggested to us that there is room for improvement in the treatment and preparation both of the coal and of the ore that they require. They desire a higher and a more uniform quality of coke than is readily obtain-able to-day. They urge that arrangements should be made for the coal to be better cleaned before coking. Coke ovens should not take supplies of coal haphazard from any colliery, but should be able to draw regular supplies from a group of collieries, and, if necessary, to blend the different coals to obtain a uniform quality of coke. Blending of coal is possible when the coke oven works are in the near vicinity of blast furnaces and steel works. It is also possible when, as many are now inclined to think is more desirable, the coke oven plants are situated in central positions which enable them to draw supplies from a number of collieries and to supply a number of steel works. In the former case, the surplus coke oven gas is available as fuel for the later stage of steel manufacture, and, in the latter, it may obtain a more profitable outlet for town use. In view of other considerations to which account must be paid, e.g., the length of haul of the coal to the coke ovens, &amp;c, the method to be adopted can only be decided in the light of the particular circumstances of each case.96. Witnesses also agreed that the organisation of home ore supplies could be improved. They pointed out that, in one of the newer fields, Northamptonshire, there were some fifty different mines, all of which supply ore of different grades. The ore should be crushed and cleaned at the mines, but the necessary plant would, no doubt, be too expensive for any one mine to undertake its installation. The suggestion was made that the mines should be amalgamated and central ore-treatment plants erected. The difficulty of carrying out such proposals lies in the great variety of quality of the ores from the existing mines, and the consequent difficulty in assessing the relative values of the mines, and in the fact that some of the mines are owned by steel-making firms who take their supplies direct. It was also urged that the industry is not in a position to provide the substantial amount of capital that
would be necessary. Similar concentration would, it was suggested, also be useful for the ore fields in Lincolnshire, the Cleveland district and the North-West Coast.97. These proposals with regard to coke and ore are designed to contribute to the better preparation of the materials generally, before they are fed to the blast furnaces, particularly with the object of obtaining a more uniform burden. This, it is believed, would lead to substantial economies. Its attainment would necessitate some reorganisation and a substantial outlay of capital.(b) Blast Furnaces.98. The evidence which we have received points generally to the conclusion that the blast furnaces are the weakest part of the equipment of the industry in the United Kingdom. Some of the furnaces are modern and well equipped, but many are old and relatively, or actually, inefficient. Of some 460 blast furnaces in the country, only some 160 were, on the average, in blast during 1929. The furnaces now at work are the more efficient furnaces. Witnesses claimed that though improvements could be made in many of these, the best practice in Great Britain compares well in regard to design of plants, technical knowledge, and operating ability with that ef any other country.99. The British blast furnaces are often criticised on the ground that their output per day compares unfavourably with that of furnaces in other countries. Efficiency should not be judged by output alone. A large furnace is uneconomical, unless it is run continuously to produce one grade of iron. In this country many grades of iron are required and the demand is not uniform. It is, therefore, often more economical to install, say, two furnaces with a capacity of 200 tons a day each than to install one with a capacity of 400 tons a day.100. When a revival of the industry in the United Kingdom takes place, new blast furnaces and coke oven plant will be necessary. Production of metallurgical coke is said to be only sufficient to meet actual requirements at the existing low rates of production. Indeed, there is even now some scarcity of coke, whenever the demand for pig iron improves. If, in addition to the steel at present produced in this country, that now imported was made by British manufacturers, nine and a half million tons of pig iron would be required annually. One witness submitted the following tentative estimates of the cost that would be involved in providing fully efficient plant for the production of pig iron on this scale. The cost of reorganisation of the home ore-fields and the erection of ore treatment plant is put at about  1,000,000. The five new centralised coke oven plants thought to be desirable, producing in all 2-J- million tons of coke a year, would cost about  4,000,000. Twenty new blast furnace plants, each capable of making normally 400 tons of iron a day, would cost about  8,000,000. The cost of modernising the 160 blast furnaces now at work was estimated at  5,000,000. The modernisation of existing coke oven plants would involve further expenditure.(c) Steel Works.101. The average level of efficiency of the steel works and rolling mills of the country is higher than that of the blast furnaces. Some of the plants are modern, many are of reasonable efficiency, and comparatively few would be regarded as obsolete. The expenditure of large sums of capital would, however, be required to modernise much of the plant and to secure an adequate balance among the different units of a complete steel works.102. In the opinion of the steel industry, as disclosed in then-evidence before us, the defects in the iron and steel producing capacity of the country are due to a variety of causes. Large extensions of plant were, for example, made during the war period, but these were designed solely with a view to war needs and in many cases were not adapted to peace-time requirements.   The
cost of these extensions was, it is true, met in part by the State, but the industry itself found large sums for this purpose during and immediately after the war. It is claimed by the industry that the Government&apos;s contribution, paid largely by way of remission of Excess Profits Duty, was quite inadequate. The capital required was raised largely by the creation of prior charges, and the heavy burden of these charges constitutes a serious handicap to the industry. In addition, for many years the iron and steel makers have, in general, made little or no profit and have been unable to make adequate, or in some cases any, allowance for the depreciation and obsolescence of their plant. In the same period, foreign competition, particularly in semi-manufactured steel, has been very severe. As the costs of production are lower on the Continent than in this country, it has been necessary for British manufac-turers, in order to secure orders, to reduce prices to very low levels (see paragraph 70).103. In many cases the prices taken afford no margin of profit and the work has been undertaken merely to reduce losses due to operating plant at less than full capacity. In addition, foreign steel has been sent to this country from time to time at prices which have appeared at times to bear little relation to cost and with which the home makers were unable to compete. On this account many works in this country have, at different times, been forced to cease work. Irregular working raises the costs of production, and these frequent stoppages have made it still more difficult for British makers to bring their costs down to a competi-tive level.104. The steel makers, consequently, regard the defects in their equipment mainly as the result, rather than the cause, of their difficulties. They have not been able to maintain their plant at its former high level of efficiency, or to obtain those economies that are possible by continuous working for the production of standardised articles. Most of the witnesses who appeared on behalf of the steel industry said that, even if its equipment were modern and thoroughly efficient, it would be impossible for the British industry to revive in present conditions. They allege that higher railway rates and labour charges, including the cost of social services, constitute a permanent handicap on the British industry by making its costs higher than those on the Continent. They also allege that the allowance permitted by the Revenue Authorities for depreciation is insufficient. Further, Continental makers are free to sell their surplus production at very low prices in this country whenever they find it convenient to do so, thus causing British works to close. If these conditions were to continue it would, in their view, be impossible for any British works, however efficient, to make a reasonable profit after setting aside sufficient sums for depreciation. Without some security against Continental competition of this kind they regard the position of the British steel maker as desperate.105. The position of the steel works which are associated with the finishing branches of the industry is, on the whole, rather less serious. One witness, representing a company owning both steel works and finishing works, said that their finishing mills obtained their supplies of steel from their own steel works; and that, taking results over a long period of time, this course had been profitable to them, although at times their competitors in the finishing trade had obtained Continental steel at very low prices. The advantage of keeping their works running continuously had compensated them for their higher costs, even at times when Continental prices were particularly low. We were informed that another works, supplying semi-finished material to its associated companies, had been reason-ably successful over a period of years. It had not, up to the present, been able to earn profits regularly, but alterations were in progress, from which it was hoped to obtain economies amounting to as much as 10s. a ton in the cost of production of steel. Another steel-making concern which had regularly supplied its associated companies with steel had drawn up plans for improvement in its ore-handling equipment and other parts of its plant. When these plans were put into operation, it was estimated that the savings
which would be effected would enable the concern to reduce costs sufficiently to enable it to produce steel at prices equal to the cost of comparable foreign steel delivered at the works.106. Although many steel works are associated with rolling mills for producing finished iron and steel products, a substantial part of the finishing trade is in the hands of independent firms which buy semi-finished steel for re-rolling. These firms, as well as the composite steel-producing and finishing concerns, frequently buy foreign semi-finished material. The finishing mills are widely distributed throughout the country and are not, in general, near those districts such as Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire or the North East Coast, which are specially suitable for the production of ordinary steel at low costs. There would be great advantages in grouping the finishing mills near the steel works. Freight would be saved and the surplus gases of the coke ovens and blast furnaces would be available for the rolling-mills.107. It has also been represented to us that, for many purposes, the finishing mills are satisfied with the quality of imported basic Bessemer steel, which is cheaper to produce than open-hearth steel, but is not now made in this country. We under-stand that there is no technical difficulty in making steel by the basic Bessemer process in selected districts in the United Kingdom. This process of steel-making was abandoned in this country in favour of processes yielding a more reliable product, but the growing demand for steel for purposes for which quality is of less importance, warrants further consideration of the possibility of again using it.IV. OTHER SECTIONS OF THE IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRY.108. The tin plate and sheet sections of the industry have been relatively prosperous in recent years. Production has been increasing fairly steadily and greatly exceeds that of pre-war years. In both sections a large part of the production is exported.(a) Tin Plates.109. The tin plate trade is concentrated in South Wales. There are a few large firms owning both- steel works and tin plate mills, and these firms do a large part of the tin plate trade. There are also many small firms, which are dependent on other firms for their supplies of steel. It appears, however, that not a very large part of the production is normally made from foreign steel. In spite of the large number of separate producing units, the tin plate trade has been able to co-operate with the tin plate makers in the United States for some regulation of competition in export markets. The latter have a very large home market in which high prices are obtained, and often sell at low prices in many of the export markets. The British and United States tin plate industries have agreed that export markets shall be divided in such a way that the British makers obtain about 70 per cent, of the total export business, and the United States makers about 30 per cent. There is no other country with a tin plate industry approaching in magnitude that of the United Kingdom or the United States, but there are growing industries in some Continental countries.110. There is no central selling organisation, but one large group has set up a selling agency which disposes of a substantial part of the products of this section. There are many modern mills, but there are a number on which money could advantageously be spent on improvements. New plant is, however, being installed to produce tin plates suitable for the high speed can-making machinery now being used. The manufacture of cans is, of course, one of the largest outlets for tin plates. It was suggested to us that the Govern-ments of the Crown Colonies might assist the tin plate industry by fostering the development of can-making and the canning of products in their territories.[6-202]e
(b) Black and Galvanised Sheets.111. The black and galvanised sheet section is more widely distributed than the tin plate section. The chief centres are Staffordshire, South Wales and Scotland. There has been com-paratively little foreign competition in the black sheet or galvanised sheet trade, either in the home or in export markets. Some countries have, however, by means of high tariffs, developed industries to supply their own home needs, the black sheets in some cases being imported for galvanising: There has also been recently an expansion of galvanised sheet manufacture on the Continent, and some indication of keener competition in export markets. The United States also export sheets at low prices when they have a surplus.112. The organisation of this trade is similar to that of the tin plate trade. Three large firms make about half the total output, but there are many small firms. There is no central selling organisation, but the Sheet Makers&apos; Conference regulates production by allocating quotas to each member, levying fines for over-production and giving compensation for deficiencies. Assistance is sometimes given by the Conference to enable members to retain difficult export markets.(c) Wrought-Iron Trade.118. The wrought iron section is suffering from exceptionally severe depression owing partly to the replacement of wrought iron by steel, and partly to foreign competition. No satisfactory substi-stute for the old manual methods of puddling has ever been found, and these are very arduous and expensive. The much cheaper material, steel, is, therefore, used in place of wrought iron wherever possible. There are also large imports, mainly from Belgium, of an inferior and cheaper material, consisting mainly of soft steel, which is used for much of the less important work for which wrought iron was formerly employed. Serious complaint is made that this inferior material is imported and sold under the description of &apos;&apos; wrought iron &quot; to the detriment of the makers of the genuine article. There is little foreign competition in genuine wrought iron, but, as its price is necessarily comparatively high, the demand is small and is decreasing.114. Since the war large sums have been spent on improvement in plant. For some years an experimental plant was operated by the industry with the object of finding some method of mechanical puddling; the experiments, however, were unsuccessful. There were 94 works making puddled iron in 1918, but 58 of them have since disappeared or have abandoned this part of their business.(d) Crucible Steel.115. The crucible steel section has also suffered considerable contraction. The special steels (alloy steels and high carbon steels) &quot;were formerly all made in the crucible, but steel made in the electric furnace, though possibly not of such uniformly high quality as crucible steel, is now very extensively used for many purposes. Foreign competition has been increasing both in the home and export markets, and high tariffs have been raised against this country in many consuming markets. The production of crucible steel has declined from about 42,500 tons in 1914 to about 13,600 tons in 1928. The industry has been working short time and is producing at only some 25 per cent, of its capacity. The number of firms engaged on crucible steel making is relatively large. The witnesses who appeared before us saw no advantage in amalgamation in this section, owing to the specialised character of the steels produced.(e) Wire and Wire Manufacturers.116. Consumption of wire and wire products is increasing fairly rapidly, and foreign competition is the chief cause of the
difficulties of the wire manufacturers. Continental countries, particularly Belgium, have obtained a large share of the British market in the standard wire products of ordinary steel. The British makers have only been able to hold their position by producing special sizes or shapes to suit individual consumers and by making the higher grades of material, such as high carbon steel wire for ropes. The total production of wire in Great Britain is about 300,000 tons a year. Imports of wire and wire products amounted in 1929 to nearly 140,000 tons, and exports to about 130,000 tons. There is a large number of producing units, and economies in production would follow their amalgamation into larger groups. Costs of production on the Continent are lower than in this country, largely, in the view of the British makers, owing to lower wage rates. It is also said that foreign1 wire and wire products are sometimes sold in this country at prices below the cost at which they were produced.117. In one branch of this trade, viz., wire netting, an agree-ment was made in 1926 regarding prices with the Belgian and German makers, but this was short-lived, owing to competition from makers in one producing country, who refused to become parties to the agreement.118. Foreign competition in the home market in another important product wire nails is very severe. Imports of wire nails amount to some 60,000 tons a year, and home production to some 13,000 tons a year. The latter consists mainly of unusual sizes and shapes of nails.(f) Steel Castings and Forgings.119. The Castings and Forgings section is also in a very depressed condition. Plant and equipment were expanded to meet war needs, but much of it has since been idle owing to depression in the home engineering and shipbuilding industries, and to foreign competition. Much of the existing plant is modern. The financial position of most of the companies is bad and is becoming worse.120. It is not likely that profits will again be earned until further schemes of amalgamation and reorganisation have been carried out by which available orders could be concentrated in a smaller number of fully employed works. We were told, for example, of one foundry built a few years ago at a cost of  250,000 which is now not working. It cannot be kept fully occupied in present conditions, and it has been found more economical to close it completely. Some time ago the British makers had price agreements with one another by which they aimed at ensuring a reasonable profit, but these broke down when foreign competition became severe.121. The lower Continental prices are said by the industry to be due to the larger and more regular output of the foreign makers and to lower standards of wages and working conditions on the Continent. Foreign forgings are also said to be, in general, of inferior quality to the British, and much of the work obtained by British makers is for material that must pass the most severe tests. In the case of steel castings, some complaints were made to us by representatives of the shipbuilding and engineering industries regarding the quality of the British product. British castings were said to be inferior to the castings made by the most efficient foreign makers and to be much more expensive. In so far as these criticisms are well-founded, they constitute a further argument for reorganisation in this section of the industry.122. Many of the firms making steel castings and forgings have other important interests. They are steel-makers, ship-builders or engineers. They are nearly all associated in the Steel. Castings Association or in one or other of the Forge-masters&apos; Associations.
V. IRON AND STEEL SCRAP.128. Steel Scrap has become almost as important as pig iron -as a material for steel manufacture, the estimated consumption of scrap in steel-making in the United Kingdom being 4 million tons a year. Before 1914 it was only about ].-?r million tons a year. A similar increase in the use of scrap has occurred in other countries. It is estimated that of the 4 million tons of scrap used about half is steel works scrap, the remainder consisting of miscellaneous material, such as the waste produced in engineering works, old rails, and the product of the breaking up of ships, machinery and plant, and other iron and steel articles.124. A substantial amount of scrap from war material, including ships, has been available in past years, and also there have been periods of very low steel production, as in 1921 and 192G, when consumption has been small and some accumulation of scrap has occurred. For some years, therefore, scrap prices were low and supplies were abundant. The scrap from war material is now exhausted and the steel trades in this and other countries have been active during the last three years. Supplies of scrap have, therefore, become scarcer.125. The Continental iron and steel-producing countries have prohibited the export of scrap, and as these are also the chief scrap-producing countries, there is little opportunity of increasing supplies in this country by means of imports. In the last two or three years Continental countries have been drawing, to a substantial extent, on British supplies. In 1926 British exports of scrap amounted to 71,943 tons: in 1927 to 260,881 tons; in 1928 to 343,737 tons; and in 1929 to 423,950 tons. In the years before the war exports averaged some 135,000 tons a year. Some of this exported material, such as cast-iron scrap and nickel-steel scrap, is not suitable for ordinary steel-making; some of it goes to the East, where it is used again without re-manufacture.126. The following table gives particulars of the export of scrap in 1929 : Quantities and Values of Exports of Iron and Steel, old and scrap, fit only for Re-manufacture (including Old Rails).Consigned to 	Tons.

A substantial proportion of the exported scrap is used in the Continental steel industries and there are special reasons in some cases for these purchases by Continental steel makers. Some countries, such as Poland, which has, in the last few years, been a -very large importer of British scrap, have heavy import duties on steel and pig iron, but none on scrap. Their domestic pig iron pro-duction is insufficient to supply the steel furnaces, and it is cheaper to buy foreign scrap even at high prices than to import pig iron. Formerly, Poland obtained supplies of scrap from Germany, but the agreement between the two countries permitting these imports from Germany, in spite of the prohibition of exports from that country, lapsed a few years ago. Moreover, Polish steel works can compete in some British markets for scrap, such as London, on at least equal terms with British steel makers, as freight to Poland is as low as it is to some British steel works. The cost of transport from London to South &quot;Wales was, for example, given to us as 17s. 6d. a ton by rail and as 6s. a ton by water, with, in the latter -,&apos;ase, an unloading charge of 4s. 2d. per ton, and in addition rail
freight from port to steel works of from Is. lid. to 4s. 5d. per ton. The freight however, from London to Dantzig is only about 8s. per ton. The Commercial Treaty recently negotiated between Germany and Poland provides for an export of 165,000 tons of scrap annually from Germany to Poland. When the Treaty has been ratified and these provisions come into force, the demands of Poland for scrap from the United Kingdom are likely to be materially diminished.128. There is no doubt that during the last few years steel works in some parts of the country have been handicapped at times by the scarcity and high price of scrap. In the spring of 1929, for example, steel works both in this country and on the Continent were busy; there were heavy demands for scrap, and its price rose above the corresponding price for pig iron. This is exceptional, as the price of scrap is usually a few shillings a ton below that of pig iron. In more recent months the position has become easier; prices have fallen and supplies are more abundant.129. Steel makers desire a restriction on the export of scrap, similar to that in force in other European countries. The Scrap Merchants, who are responsible for the collection, and in some respects for the production of the scrap, have put to us the other side of the question. They claim that scrap collection and sorting is carried on with only a small margin of profit, and that unless the merchant can obtain the full value of the scrap he will he unable to maintain the present volume of supplies. The shipbreaker would be less able to compete with foreign shipbreakers in purchasing old ships if he were restricted in the way he disposes of his scrap. A restriction on the export of scrap might lead, therefore, to a restric-tion on the export of ships which would seriously interfere with the normal course of business of the shipowner. Even if such a course were feasible we should, therefore, feel great hesitation in recommending its adoption, as we are doubtful whether it would be in the interests of the steel makers, or would serve the interests of the country as a whole. International obligations, however, render it impossible for any export prohibition of scrap to be adopted by this country. The Anglo-German Commercial Treaty of 1924 precludes Great Britain from imposing a prohibition on the export of scrap to Germany, and most-favoured-nation provisions in existing commercial treaties with most other countries prevent prohibition of export to them unless the prohibition applies also to Germany and all other countries. In addition, the International Convention for the abolition of import and export prohibitions and restrictions also renders impossible the imposition of such a prohibition. This Convention is already in force temporarily as regards this country, and will, come into operation permanently when a sufficient number of States have ratified it.130. We have no proposals to make, therefore, directed solely towards the improvement of scrap supplies, but we think that the consolidation and reorganisation of the industry that we recommend for other reasons will also be of assistance regarding scrap. The scrap merchants think they would be able to improve the position for the steel maker if the latter kept them more fully informed of his future requirements. There is no general buying organisation among the steel makers; each maker goes into the market for scrap as and when he wants it. A better understanding between buyer and seller as to what the former wanted would clearly help to stabilise a trade of this kind, and we have no doubt that organisation of the steel trade into a number of larger units would greatly assist in the attainment of this understanding.VI.-WAGES AND HOURS.181. We have already referred (paragraph 6) to the arrange-ments made by His Majesty&apos;s Government, on our recommenda-tion, for the despatch of officers by the Ministry of Labour as a Mission to investigate conditions of hours and wages in the chief Continental steel-making countries, in conjunction with represen-tatives of the British Iron and Steel Trades Employers&apos; Association and the Iron and Steel Trades&apos; Confederation.
132. The Report of this Mission gives the result of their investigations in France, Belgium, Luxemburg, Germany and Czechoslovakia, and contains a large amount of information not previously available in this country. We submit it as a separate document for the consideration of the Economic Advisory Council, who will, no doubt, consider whether they should recommend His Majesty&apos;s Government to secure the concurrence of the British Iron and Steel Trades Employers&apos; Association and the Iron and Steel Trades&apos; Confederation in its presentation to Parliament as a Command Paper.133. From the Mission&apos;s Report the following general con-elusions can be drawn : (i) The blast furnaces in all the countries visited work con-tinuously, with three shifts, the usual hours of work for shift workers thus being 56 hours a week. A similar practice is followed in Great Britain.(ii) The melting shops in the principal steel-producing countries on the Continent begin work at times varying from 6 p.m. on Sunday to midnight Sunday, and finish work at 6 a.m. on the following Sunday. In certain cases preparatory work begins about 4 hours earlier. The hours of effective work for each of the three sets of shift workers employed range, therefore, from about 49 to 52 hours a week. In Great Britain, the shops generally begin work at times varying from 2 p.m. Sunday to 6 a.m. on Monday, and finish work at 1 p.m. or 2 p.m. on Saturday. The hours of effective work for each of the three shifts range, therefore, from 42^ to 47f hours a week.(iii) The rolling mills on the Continent begin work at 6 a.m. on Monday and finish work at 6 a.m. on Sunday. The hours of effective work for each of the three sets of shift workers are, therefore, 48 hours a week. In Great Britain, the mills generally begin work at 10 p.m. on Sunday or 6 a.m. Monday, and finish work at 12 noon or 1 p.m. Saturday. The hours of effective work range, therefore, from 42 to 45 hours a week.134. The Mission give a series of valuable tables regarding the earnings of various classes of men in the Continental industries, and also make an estimate of the average normal weekly earnings of all workers, as follows : Estimated Average Normal Weekly Earnings.France Belgium  ... Luxemburg Germany... Czecho-SlovakiaIn Foreign Currencies.230 francs 310 francs 320 francs 52 marks 250 kronenApproximate Sterling Equivalent.87/-35/5 &apos; 36/7 50/11 30/5The Iron and Steel Trades Employers&apos; Association, in evidence submitted to us, estimated the average earnings in Great Britain as 67/3(L a week; the National Federation of Iron and Steel Manufacturers state that, according to returns received from 138 firms employing 117,005 workpeople, the average weekly earnings were 58/5 in December 1929, 60/10 in January 1930 and 63/1 in February 1980. The Ministry of Labour made an inquiry regarding the average earnings in various industries in October 1928, and at that time the average earnings in pig iron manufacture were 59/1 a week, and in smelting, rolling, &amp;c, of iron and steel were 60/1 a week.185. We feel that we are under a deep obligation to the members of the Mission for their work in collecting this informa-tion on our behalf. In submitting to the Economic Advisory Council this summary of their principal conclusions, we feel, however, that it is only right to draw attention to the difficulty, in dealing with such complex problems, of making reliable comparisons between conditions in one country and another.   The
Mission&apos;s Report does not show and indeed in the short time available for their investigations hardly could have shown  whether the definitions of the various classes of worker adopted as the basis of comparison is in each country the same. Farther, Trade Union restrictions and other forms of demarcation make such comparisons very speculative.136. Another question with which the Mission&apos;s Report could not be expected to deal is the net effect on production costs of the varying conditions of hours and wages in the countries visited. The lay-out and organisation of the steel plants in those countries are in many cases widely different from those in Great Britain, and further often differ as between one country and another, and, indeed, within a single country. Detailed investigations by accountants could, no doubt, show what is the amount of labour charges in the case of individual plants in particular countries. Such figures, if obtained, could not, however, be regarded as giving a true picture for all plants of the relative conditions obtaining in those countries.187. To sum up, we should not ourselves feel justified on the information available in saying more than that on the whole it is probable that labour costs in the Continental steel-making countries are lower than in Great Britain.VII. COMPARISON OF BRITISH AND CONTINENTAL JRON AND STEEL INDUSTRIES.(a) Introductory.138. The difference between the general position of the steel industries on the Continent and in the United Kingdom in recent years is very marked. The Continental industries have been growing rapidly, while the British industry has shown no expansion and has had difficulty in maintaining its volume of output. In addition, the Continental steel makers have made, and are making, large profits, of which they are devoting a considerable part to improvement of plant. The British industry has, however, in general, made little or no profit, and has been unable even to earn enough to enable it to make proper allowances for depreciation and for obsolescence of plant. The value of the plants of the British industry is, in fact, decreasing from year to year, while those of its rivals are increasing.(b) Organisation of the Continental Industries.139. In each of the principal competing countries on the Continent, the concentration of steel-producing firms into a number of large units has been in progress for many years. The result is that most of the trade is in the hands of a comparatively small number of large Companies. These Companies are generally vertical amalgamations; they control their coal and ore supplies and have their own works for finishing the iron and steel. A single Company, the Vereinigte Stahhcerke, formed in Germany in 1926 by the amalgamation of a number of separate companies, has an output of about 4,000,000 tons of steel a year and a capital of  70,000,000. In each country the producing units are further associated under various forms of central control.140. In Germany, the production and sales of some 90 per -cent, of the industry are controlled by a series of syndicates or cartels, of which the chief is the Ingot Steel Association. These syndicates determine home prices and, for some products, export prices. The former are substantially higher than world prices, but to ensure that no damage shall be done to the finishing trades in export markets, a rebate, equivalent to the difference between home and world market prices, is allowed on steel sold for producing goods for export. A further measure of control of the industry is obtained by agreements with the industries in other Continental countries regarding the amount of steel thev may export to Germany.
141. In France, the general policy of the industry, in which the heavy and finishing sections are closely associated, is directed by an old-established body known as the Gomiti des Forges which embraces substantially the whole trade. To this Committee was entrusted the expansion and direction of the iron and steel trade during the war, and it was under its guidance that the trade was re-organised and re-constructed after the war. Associated with this body is the Federation of Metallurgical Mining and Allied Industries, under the joint guidance of which a number of &apos;&apos; comptoirs&apos;&apos; have been formed to control the production and sale of iron and steel products. The principal body, the Corrvptoir Siderurgique, represents the French industry in international cartel discussions.142. A somewhat different form of organisation has grown up in Belgium, where a small number of separate companies act as selling and purchasing agents for groups of large producing units. There is close co-operation between the heavy and finishing sections of the industry.(c) International Organisation of the Foreign Steel Industries:.143. The production of the countries referred to in the preceding paragraphs, as well as those of a number of others, is now regulated by the International Steel Cartel. This body determines, from time to time, what shall be the total steel pro-duction of the participating countries. Each country is allotted a definite proportion of the total production and each producing unit is allotted a share from the national quota. There are fines for production in excess of this and compensation for under-production. The International Steel Cartel aims at regulating production in accordance with consumption, and at preventing undue falls in prices through over-production. Further proposals for inter-national co-operation have recently been reported. The formation of international selling syndicates, controlling both exports and prices of many steel products in most Continental countries is suggested.(d) Efficiency of Plant in Continental Countries.144. The iron and steel plant in Belgium, France and Germany is at a high level of efficiency. This is, to a large extent, an effect of the war. Under the Treaty of Versailles, the plants in Lorraine were lost to the German steel-makers, but new plants were erected by them in the Ruhr with the money received as compensation from the German Government. The burden of the prior charges on the German plant was greatly reduced by the de-valuation of the mark, and thereby it was possible for the industry to obtain foreign loans for further reconstruction. Moreover, the industry has been so prosperous in recent years that it has been able to devote large sums from its profits towards improving and extending its plant. It is said that  17,000,000 has been spent on new coke oven plant alone in the last few years, and that a single Company, the Vereinigte Stahhoerke, spent  18,750,000 on improvements and new construction between 1925 and 1928.145. The Belgian plants were almost wholly destroyed in 1918, so that, with a few exceptions, the existing plants are quite modern. A large part of the cost of reconstruction was met by reparation payments, but a substantial amount was obtained from the public by capital issues. It is said that the banks in Belgium are greatly interested in the industry as ordinary shareholders as well as debenture holders. In the last few years, many improvements have been made out of profits.146. At the outbreak of the war, a large part of the French iron and steel plant fell into the hands of Germany. During the war, much new plant was installed by the French for war purposes, and,, after the Armistice, many works were reconstructed from reparation payments. Further, the French industry was reinforced by the addition of the Lorraine works, which were sold by the French Government to the larger groups.   Considerable sums were raised
from the public at fixed rates of interest, but the depreciation of the currency has, as in the case of Germany, greatly reduced the burden of all fixed capital charges. Since then, many improvements have been made from profits.147. The prosperity of these Continental industries in recent years has been one of the main factors in enabling them to obtain the money necessary for extensions and improvements. In Germany, moreover, the banks take a more direct interest in industry than do those in the United Kingdom. They have large share-holdings in many iron and steel companies, and direct repre-sentatives on the boards of Directors. These representatives take an active part in the conduct of the business. The presence of bankers on such boards is said to have provided the impulse to amalgamation in many instances.(e) Organisation of the British Industry.148. In the heavy section of the British Industry, two-thirds of the production is in the hands of ten companies. Most of these own several works,and,in general, they control collieries, ore mines and finishing works. The remaining third of the industry consists of a large number of independent firms, many of which are quite small. There are also many small concerns in the subsidiary branches of the trade.150. There are numerous old-established trade associations, generally local in character and consisting of the members of some particular branch of the industry. Many of these associations aim at establishing a ruling market price for the main products of their members. They are probably not very effective in respect of export trades, but do something to eliminate wasteful competition in the home market. In addition, almost the whole industry is included in the National Federation of Iron and Steel Manufacturers. The Federation has no executive powers, but assists the units of the industry on all matters of general interest other than those connected with labour. The latter are dealt with by the Iron and Steel Trades Employers&apos; Association. The National Federation has been instrumental in forming a National Research Council for the industry, which represents the trade in its dealings with other industries and public bodies.151. It is, however, clear that there is much less real co-operation among the units of the industry in this country than there is on the Continent. For example, much advantage would be obtained by a better understanding in this country between the primary and the finishing branches of the trade, which, on the Continent, are closely associated.152. The organisation of the industry is, however, changing. Some of the larger companies are combining to form units which may become comparable with the largest units on the Continent. Re-groupings are taking place among other companies with the object of concentrating the production of similar products. There is no doubt that further combination among the existing companies is urgently required. In general, the formation of larger vertical combinations appears to be essential. The problem of the maximum size of such units from the point of view of efficiency, or the number of stages of production that should be covered by them, has not received much attention in this country. This is probably because even the largest units are substantially smaller than any such maximum. One witness did, however, advocate a more complete form of combination; all producers of similar products in one district should, in his view, amalgamate, and a further control should be established through a central trust, which would direct the policj&apos; and control the finance and export trade of the whole industry.158. The makers of rolling mill products for structural work and shipbuilding have, in the last few years, combined in a scheme which has resulted in nearly all the needs of the shipbuilding industry for such material being met by British steel. Under this scheme a rebate from the normal price is allowed to shipbuilders [6202] f
&apos;  filwho use only British steel. Quite recently the Steel Export Association has been formed to control nearly the whole of the export trade in sections, joists and plates. The pig-iron makers in certain districts also have agreed on schemes to regulate selling prices.154. In the heavy section the British makers have not joined the International Steel Cartel. We have been informed that some conversations on the subject took place a few years ago, but it was soon clear that the Continental makers were not prepared to offer a quota acceptable to the United Kingdom. The figure offered was, in fact, much smaller than the actual production in this country in subsequent years. British makers feel that they cannot hope for a reasonable agreement with the Continental makers in existing conditions. It is very convenient for the latter to be able to sell their surplus steel in this country whenever it suits them to do so, and they cannot be expected voluntarily to forgo this advantage. Moreover, they know that British costs are higher than theirs, and that the British industry as at present organised and in existing fiscal conditions is not in a position to retaliate. The Continental makers, therefore, have, at present, everything to lose and nothing to gain by bringing the United Kingdom into the Cartel, unless the British makers are content with a very low quota. If the latter were members of the Cartel some reduction, by agreement, of the imports of semi-finished steel into this country might be expected. In that event, the home works would be more fully occupied, costs would be reduced, and it might be possible to earn profits. British steel makers say that, unless they have safe-guarding, or a promise of safeguarding, or are given some other bargaining power, they cannot obtain from the Cartel a quota for the British industry that would offer them any advantages. We deal further with this aspect of the problem in paragraph 167.VIII. REMEDIES SUGGESTED.155. In the following paragraphs we discuss the remedies which have been suggested to us for the present difficulties of the iron and steel industry. We then indicate our conclusions and outline the policy which we recommend should be adopted.(a) Safeguarding.156. For some years a large part of the steel industry has been asking for some form of tariff protection. The application made in 1925, which is referred to in paragraph 90, was for a safeguarding duty on certain raw or semi-finished material, and on wire, wire netting and woven wire.157. The industry is still strongly in favour of an import duty, and, though no definite scheme for such a duty has been put before us, we understand that the industry would now propose that the scope of the duty should be extended to cover a much larger range of articles than those included in the application made in 1925. The re-rollers, who use the semi-finished material that is imported, are now meeting even more severe foreign competition than formerly in their own products, such as hoops and strips, bars and sections, and they hold that any import duty should apply to their products also. It must be expected that the manufacturing users of the products of the re-rollers would, in turn, ask for a duty on their own products equivalent to any duty placed on their raw materials. A duty on materials of the kind produced by the steel industry must be expected, therefore, as was foreseen in 1925, to lead to demands, which it would be difficult to refuse, for duties on a very wide range of articles of which steel forms a part.158. A small section of the re-rolling trade is opposed to the imposition of any import duty. In their view, the prosperity of many of the finishing branches of the industry depends on their being able to obtain cheap foreign steel. In this connection, another question of some importance arises that of a drawback
(b) Re-introduction of Trade Facilities.164. Among possible methods of assisting the steel industry in its present difficulties, suggestions have been made that His Majesty&apos;s Government should secure the passage of legislation authorising the grant by the Government of guarantees to the ironof duty on serai-finished steel when the finished goods made from it are exported. The industry does not appear to have any definite views on this question. Some witnesses said they had not given the matter any consideration, and others thought that a drawback should not be given, as much of the value of the duty would be lost if the finishing trades that work largely for export could continue to use foreign steel without paying the import duty.159. Another side of this question was submitted to us by the tin plate trade. British tin plates are exported to a number of countries for making containers, which are subsequently exported, and most countries grant a drawback of the import duty or its equivalent in such circumstances. The tin plate industry fear that, if this country imposed a duty on steel without a drawback on tin plates made from it, many of the Continental countries which at present allow drawback facilities would be disposed to withdraw them. A considerable part of the export of British tin plates might be affected, and the trade would view any such prospect with a good deal of anxiety.160. Evidence has been put before us on this subject by two important steel-using industries, shipbuilding and engineering. The Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation are, as a body, definitely opposed- to any import duty on steel. Although a very large proportion of the steel now used by them is British steel, they feel no assurance that the price of it would not be raised if a duty were imposed on foreign steel. They themselves are experiencing such severe foreign competition that they could not contemplate any further handicap. The evidence from the British Engineers&apos; Association was less definite. They would be opposed to the imposition of a duty on steel, if the duty led merely to an increase in the price of steel and a continuance of the present conditions in the steel industry, but would have no objection to an import duty, if it was accompanied by a thorough re-organisation of the steel industry and a cheapening of home-produced iron and steel through the increased and more regular output of the home works.161. The steel makers claim that an import duty on steel is essential to the revival of the industry. There is general agreement that some re-organisation of the industry is necessary, and that additional capital is required for this purpose. Steel makers claim that it would be impossible to obtain this, unless the investor had some assurance of profit. There is no such assurance at present, and, in general, steel makers hold the view that no such assurance could be given as long as Continental steel can at any time be sold freely in their home market.162. We recognise the necessity for new capital and the diffi-culty of obtaining it, but we do not accept the views of the steel makers on the immediate need for a duty on steel. Protection at the present time would, we believe, actually delay the reforms that are urgently required, as it would lead to the maintenance of a number of plants, not designed for efficient production or suitable for amalgamation, which, in the interests of the industry as a whole, should not be encouraged to continue. The re-organisation of the industry, especially in the heavy section, and, to a large extent, its re-equipment, is the first essential step. We are hopeful that when it has been re-organised on the lines that we recommend, the industry will be able to compete effectively with its Continental rivals without the adventitious assistance of protection.163. The need for re-organisation is, we believe, generally recognised in the industry and we are hopeful that this policy will be more vigorously pursued if, as we recommend, His Majesty&apos;s Government decline to consider any proposal for protection until the industry has been thoroughly re-organised.
-and steel industry on the lines of the old Trade Facilities Acts. We are opposed to any such proposal. We believe that the policy of giving guarantees of this kind is unsound in itself. Further, there is, in our view, no need for such guarantees to finance the necessary reconstruction of the iron and steel industry. For the reasons given in paragraph 170 below, we are satisfied that all the necessary funds for re-organisation will be forthcoming through normal financial channels.(c) Reorganisation.165. As we have indicated in Sections III and IV of this Eeport, we are of opinion that a far-reaching re-organisation of the iron and steel industry is essential as a first step towards a renewal of its prosperity. It would be an essential part of such a re-organisation that the units of the industry should be large enough to obtain the advantages to be derived from large-scale buying or production of raw materials, continuous running of selected works on the manufacture of the products for which they are best suited, financial reserves sufficient for any extension or alteration of plant that may be necessary, and an adequate -organisation for selling in the home market and for export.166. We are not in a position to lay down in detail the lines -on which any such re-organisation should proceed. That is a question for experts in the industry after examination of the circumstances of each case. In general, however, we consider that the producing units should be in the nature of vertical combinations owning their sources of supply of raw materials and producing finished steel goods, and that each unit should, in the main, be confined to one district and should substantially represent the whole .of that district.167. An amalgamation of the heavy steel-producing firms on the North-East Coast would probably constitute one such unit. If other regional amalgamations were arranged on this scale, the industry of the whole country could be organised in five or six units. When such regional amalgamations have been effected, it will be possible for the large units so created to make arrangements with one another for the development of the industry on national lines, thereby still further reducing costs. The industry, when re-organised in this way, would at last be in a position to negotiate effectively with the highly-organised foreign industries for an adequate share of the markets of the world. It would also be in a position to forecast the probable changes in the world demand for particular classes and qualities of steel products and to adapt itself to meet them. ,168. In one or two districts a promising beginning has been made in the direction of re-organisation on these lines, and further negotiations are being carried on in the same direction. It is only natural that great difficulties should be met in arranging these re-organisations. We believe, however, they are of such a kind that it should be within the power of the industry and its owners and advisers to remove them. We are assured that the technical assistance necessary in the planning of the new units can be readily obtained, and that there need be no anxiety as to the supply of men capable of managing and directing the new units. One serious -cause of delay in the process of reconstruction arises from the reluctance, which is no doubt natural, of the companies and firms in the industry to recognise the facts of the present position. Our inquiry has made it abundantly clear that a number of companies and firms in the iron and steel industry are already in an embarrassed condition. Many of them are heavily loaded with debt and are not only making no profits, but are unlikely ever to do so again until re-organisation is effected. We are of opinion, however, that when the industry is reconstructed so as to be able to reap to the full the advantage which this country possesses for steel production, a new. era of prosperity will open.169. As explained in Section VII (paragraphs 144 to 146)., causes arising out of the late war have enabled France, Belgium, Luxembourg  and  Germany  to  re-equip  their  iron  and  steel
industries at a time when the British industry has been passing, through exceptional difficulties and has been unable to maintain its plant at the same high level of efficiency. Reconstruction to be successful must, therefore, be far-reaching in character. It will require sacrifice on the part of all those connected with the industry, not only the shareholders but also the debenture stock holders and mortgagees. The security available to the latter is, in many cases, small to-day and is diminishing. The only way by which they can improve it is for them to recognise frankly what is the present position, and to co-operate fully in the steps that com-petent advisers regard as necessary to put the industry on a sound productive and financial footing, even though this involves a large writing down of the nominal value of their interests.170. The policy recommended in the preceding paragraphs would require for its fulfilment the gradual introduction of large sums of new capital into the industry. The amount required has been variously estimated by witnesses as something approaching  15,000,000, with a possibility that it might eventually reach a higher figure. In view of the bad trading results of recent years, it would not be possible for existing concerns or for mere amalgamations of such concerns to obtain the capital that they require by a public issue, and many of the large iron and steel companies are already deeply indebted to the joint stock banks, which could not reasonably be expected to increase their commit-ments by taking up new capital. In short, there would be no prospect of the industry securing the finance that it urgently requires if it were determined to maintain its present form of organisation. In view of the evidence which the Governor of the Bank of England was good enough to put before us, we have, however, reason to believe that the sums, large in amount as they may ultimately be, required to finance re-organisation schemes in the iron and steel industry will be forthcoming provided that the technical, administrative and financial aspects of the schemes proposed are, on examination, found to be wide and satisfactory.171. Finally, we are conscious that, in the opinion of many witnesses of great experience, a measure of protection should precede or be contemporaneous with reorganisation, as they fear, even with the full advantages to be gained from the latter, that their competitive powers will not suffice to meet the prices of foreign rivals, whose working week is longer and whose wages are less than those prevailing now in this country. Vertical grouping into more compact units is essential, and in the process elimination of uneconomic works may be found necessary and, until progress is made to this end, it cannot be said that the steel trade in Great Britain is, on the whole, in as efficient a condition as is the trade in other countries. We fear that safeguarding at the present juncture would delay reorganisation and might preserve a number of businesses whose continued existence is not to the public advantage or good for the trade as a whole.172. We have, therefore, come to the conclusion, on the evidence put before us from all parties interested in the problem, that reorganisation should be the first step, and that it should be accelerated as much as possible, as temporising and delay may be damaging to the industry. It might be dangerous to await the reorganisation of the whole industry to determine whether that policy, unaccompanied by safeguarding, would be sufficient to meet foreign competition. If, after certain large regional units have been organised in the most efficient manner, technically, commer-cially and financially, it should be found that they were still unable to compete with foreign countries, or that the benefits which it is claimed that reorganisation by itself would produce could not be realised, a resort to safeguarding for a period sufficient to re-establish the industry should be seriously considered, as in the view of some of us such a step would then be imperative. During the suggested trial of reorganisation without safeguarding, a thorough examination should be undertaken by His Majesty&apos;s Government of the problems which would require solution if, in the event of the failure of that reorganisation, resort to safeguarding proved necessarj&apos;.
173. We desire to express our thanks to our Secretaries, Mr. A. F. Hemming, C.B.E., and Mr. W. Palmer, for the services they have rendered to us. Their knowledge of the subject and the skill and attention they have devoted to the Inquiry have greatly assisted us and lessened our labour. We also desire to place on record the benefits we have derived from the presence of Mr. Percy Ashley, C.B., Principal Assistant Sewetary, Board of Trade, whose services the President of the Board of Trade kindly placed at our disposal.IX. SUMMARY   OF   CONCLUSIONS   AND   RECOMMENDA-TIONS.(a) Conclusions. 175.   We summarise our general conclusions as follows: (i) In the period since the war, imports of various classes of foreign steel have increased and exports have decreased. Total imports of foreign steel which, in the period 1910-1913, amounted to 1,849,000 tons, had risen to 2,817,000 tons in 1929. In the same period exports of British steel fell from 4,747.000 tons to 4,379,000 tons. Further, this country has not maintained its former share in the world&apos;s iron and steel trade, notwithstanding the growth of world consumption of steel and of the great increase of productive capacity in this country during the war.(ii) The iron and steel produced in this country has been sold at low prices which have not only yielded little or no profit on the capital employed, but in many cases have been insufficient to enable adequate provision to be made for depreciation.(iii) On the Continent the same period has witnessed a remark-able progress in the iron and steel industries, especially in Belgium, Luxembourg, France and Germany. Special conditions arising out of the war (e.g., the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, monetary conditions, &amp;c.) materially assisted the recovery of the iron and steel industries in those countries. Since their recovery from the imme-diate effects of the war, they have, for a variety of reasons, earned good profits, which have enabled them to maintain their plants at a high level of efficiency and to extend and modernise them still further.(iv) The organisation of the British iron and steel industry differs from that of its Continental rivals chiefly in the following respects: (a) A large number of relatively small concerns are engaged inthe production of the same range of articles.(b) No effective machinery exists for co-operation in commercialactivities or for the formulation of a national policy.(v) Under the British system there are no means of ensuring that orders are so placed as to enable plants to be run at full capacity and, therefore, at the lowest costs.(vi) No recovery of the British iron and steel industry can be looked for until steps have been taken to lower the costs of production sufficiently to enable it to compete with its foreign rivals.(vii) The first necessary step to this end is the formation of large regional amalgamations strong enough : (a) to secure the economies of mass production and the allocation of orders to the plants best suited for their execution;(b) to obtain the finance required to bring their plants to thehighest level of technical efficiency ;to enter into arrangements for a national production and sales policy which could later form the basis for participation in international agreements.
(viii) Large sums of new capital will be gradually required to finance amalgamations of the type indicated in the preceding con-clusion. On this point we are assured by the Governor of the Bank of England that the sums, large in amount as they may ultimately be, required to finance reorganisation schemes in the iron and steel industry will be forthcoming, provided that the technical, administra-tive and financial aspects of the schemes proposed are, on examination, found to be wide and satisfactory.175. In the light of the foregoing conclusions we recommend that His Majesty&apos;s Government should take every step in their power to urge on all concerned in the conduct of the iron and steel industry the importance of proceeding as rapidly as possible with the formation of large regional amalgamations as the essential preliminary condition to the recovery of the trade that has been lost.(b) Recommendation.(Signed)SANKEY, Chairman.
