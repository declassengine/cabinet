1 !11 9Lous pOCUMINT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.R3T.,*2S0(51). LOKDON PASSENGER TRANSPORT BILL. Copy No. memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Transport,The following memoranda, which explain the present position f the London Messenger Transport Bill are, for the convenience of the sDinet, set out, first, to give a picture of the present position in uite general terms,  and then, &quot;by references to the appropriate appendix,  to give a more detailed explanation of particular points.They do not attempt to discuss the political considerations hicli will he fully present to the mind of the Cahinet, as they are to y own, hut rather deal with outstanding questions from the point of iew of transport efficiency and the financial stability of the proposed oard,osition if the Bill does not pass.It is, however, important in view of the recent propaganda gainst the ps.ssing of the Bill to appreciate the position if the Bill oes not pass into law.The Bill embodies a large scale scheme for the control and o-ordination of the passenger traffic of the London area,  and it must e ohvious that it is quite impossible to guarantee that all the xisting undertakers will, as individual concerns, he entirely satisfied ith its provisions.      Doubtless many of them feel that as individuals hey would he &quot;better off without any Bill at all.     But successive ovemoments nave decided that a large scale measure of co-ordination and control is essential and urgent.      It can he shown that it is not possible compromise with or satisfy certain typos of organised opposition to the ill without mutilating it to such an extent that the present and future nterests of millions of travellers, whose opinion is neither vocal nor rganised, would he imperilled.During the last thirty years there have &quot;been numerous inquiries B.nd reports &quot;by Royal Commissioners, Departmental Committees, etc,  into the conditions of London passenger transport, all of which, and indeed all responsible opinion, agree as to the need for some wide measure of oo-&quot;rdinetion which can only he achieved through the fusion, so far as
practicable, of the numerous passenger transport systems concerned.     The present Bill is the first attempt to attain this object in a comprehensive manner by legislation, and there is little doubt that, if the Bill fails to pass, the acknowledged need for the rationalisation of passenger-transport in the London area may indefinitely remain unmet.A mere revival of the old co-ordination Bills, even if the parties were prepared to revive them, could not be regarded as a satisfactory solution and any attempt to frame new proposals would, I am sure, give rise to new difficulties not inferior to any with which we are now faced.It ^ould, I think, be unfortunate if, at a time when the need for economic- reconstruction is generally admitted and when public attention has been focussed on the particular problem of London traffic, the great expenditure of effort and money should be wasted and a piece of constructive work accepted by the overwhelming majority of the interests immediately concerned should be left undone.Apart from this general consideration, I fear that we shall at once be faced with certain practical consequences of failure to legislate.The position of the Area Traffic Commissioners and of the Minister of Transport in adjudicating between the claims of rival motor coach proporietors on the one hand and the interests of the railv/ay companies and the omnibus and tramway undertakings on the other is becoming increasingly difficult and many troublesome and embarrassing decisions will have to be taken which would be avoided if, as proposed by the Bill, competition in the London area for local traffic were completely eliminated.In the next place, bir William McLintock&apos;s evidence has called attention to the quite unjustifiable profits being earned by some of the independent proprietors.     We must, therefore, expect demands for reductions in fares so as to reduce the
earnings of these undertakings which operate under the shelter of the London Traffic Act, 1922f, within reasonable limits, This will raise a problem of the acutest difficulty in dealing with the omnibus fares of other undertakings which may either not be making unreasonable profits or are applying excess profits to support other means of transport essential to the public.Thirdly, we must be prepared to face stagnation of development or else to continue the policy of subsidising any further tube construction that may be necessary.     The Bill seeks to put London traffic on a self-supporting basis.;:: Lastly, and in particular, it will, I fear, be useless to look for any electrification of the Main Line Railways in the north and east of London unless the Exchequer contributes substantially towards the cost.     On the other hand, with the assurance against unreasonable and unnecessary competition which the passing of the Bill would afford to them, the Main Line Companies should be financially able to proceed with the electrification of some of their suburban lines where that process is long overdue,Msasureof, agreement reached. as ato j^rgsent^J^l,!^This Bill was reported to the House of Commons in July last after a most exhaustive and critical examination by a Joint Select Committee whose proceedings coccupied 55 parliamentary da5rs spread over a period of J months.     The printed minutes occupy 1^22 pages of closely printed matter.     Immediately prior to the dissolution, resolutions were passed in both Houses enabling the Bill to be carried over to the new Parliament, and, upon the passing of a motion moved by a   Minister of the Crown to be decided without amendment or debate, consideration of the Bill can be resumed at the stage, at which it was left in July.During the proceedings in Ccmmittee agreements were reached between the Minister of Transport and by far the greater majority of the interests concerned.
-fl (21These agreements included(a)   A complete agreement with the Underground Group &quot;both as to the principles- of the Bill and the terms of transxer of their undertakings. These companies represent over 75^ of the capital which would he merged under the Transport Board,(h)   Agreements with the Ik local authorities whosetramways would he transferred to the Board, as to the terms of transfer.      In some cases the actual terms were embodied in the Bill and in the remainder the basis on which the terms are to be fixed was agreed,      Vith the exception of the objection by the London County Council, to which reference is made below, the local authorities concerned may be said to be in agreement with the Bill as it stands,(c) A complete agreement with the k amalgamated railwaycompanies in respect of their suburban lines and other interests in the area affected by the Bill, The principal item in this agreement is the setting up of a pool of passenger receipts between the Board and these companies.(d) A complete agreement with the important provincialomnibus companies who operate in the area contiguous to the London Passenger Transport area.(e) A complete agreement with the various trade unions and associations representing the employees of the various undertakings, with regard to terms of transfer of staff, superannuation funds, etcx Agreement was also reached with all the important unions concerned, for the establishment of statutory wages machinery relating to certain grades.
(f) The interests of manufacturers and gas, water and electricity -undertakers who petitioned against the Bill were safeguarded either by agreed amendments or by amendments made by the Committee,,(g) Of the parties who remain in opposition to the Bill agreement wss reached with the Metropolitan Railway Company for the exclusion from the transfer of the property of their Surplus Lands Committee, and special points of objection taken by several of the smaller omnibus and cocoh companies were met by agreed clauses.    The clause containing the directions to the Arbitration Tribunal as to the determination of the terms of transfer, failing agreement;, was settled by the Joint Committee itself after hearing the views of all parties at great length.5.      Since the Bill was reported,  it has been carefully scrutinised and a certain number of amendments, mainly of a drafting character, will be required0    None of these amendments, however, raise any question of principle or of substance with which it is necessary to trouble the Cabinet.60     Throughout the proceedings in Committee, none of the opposing interests celled expert evidence to contest the general principles on which the Bill is based and it was evident that there was general agreement both as to the need on traffic and financial grounds for a measure of fusion such as the Bill would bring about end as to the general lines on which the Bill was framed,,7.      In accordance with the conclusions of the Cabinet 75 (31) item 6, a copy of a memorandum circulated to the Cabinet on the 31st August last is annexed.
8.     There certain major points which, despite the decision of the Committee, we have reason to believe will he subject to further opposition.    The salient facts concerning these major points ere set out in separate memoranda under the following headings:(a) The Metropolitan Railway Company and Its demand to he included in the main line pooling scheme.(h) The appointment of the Board and its relation to the Ministrv of Transport.9.     As regards the Metropolitan Railway, this Company isnot opposed to the general scheme of co-ordination of london passenger Transport proposed by the Bill except in so far as theBill provides that their Undertaking should he acquired by thenew Board, instead of being included in the Pooling scheme proposed to be set up between the Board and the four AmalgamatedRailway Companies in respect of the London Suburban passenger services.On the merits of the case, the claim that the Metropolitan Railway is a &quot;Main-line&quot; railway and should he treated like the London Midland and Scottish Railway, for example, is untenable.    Any scheme for the co-ordination of London passenger transport which left the &quot;Inner Circle&quot; and other sections of the Metropolitan Railway in independent hands would be a makeshift and incomplete arrangement which no traffic witness did or could defend. The complete absorption of the Metropolitan Railway presents no practical difficulties:    as was admitted by the Company&apos;s witness before the Joint Select Committee.The Metropolitan Railway was deliberately left out of the grouping schemes required under the Railways Act, 1921,  or the ground that it ;ras essentially a London local railway and could thus be more appropriately dealt with when the London Traffic problem was taken in hand.
In view of the impression which the Company seeks to spread that the scheme would not be impaired by the omission of the Metropolitan Railway from the merger, I would earnestly ask the Cabinet to peruse the detailed statement of the facts which appear in Appendix A and which convinced a majority-- of the Select Committee,Before the Joint Committee the Metropolitan Company also pressed that,  if their undertaking is acquired by the Board, their shareholders  (or at least their ordinary shareholders) should have the option of payment in cash.The Joint Committee, after hearing prolonged argument on the point, rejected the&apos; claim of the company.    All the other private interests concerned (with the exception of the small independent omnibus proprietors) have agreed to accept stock.    SirMcLIntock who advised the late Government, was fully satisfied that no other course was reasonable and that the Metropolitan shareholders would suffer &apos;.o injustice in being required to take stock in the consolidated undertaking of the Board In exchange for that now held in their own undertaking, which will form part of the consolidation. This follows the precedent of the Railways /,ct, 1921.Appendix A d:vals also in greater detail with the claims and contentions of the Metropolitan Rsilwav Companv under this head There can be no reasonable doubt that the future success of the Board would be imperilled if it were forced in the early days of its existence to make large issues of stock and it 7/ould manifestly be uafair to other interests who have agreed to take slock that any Important element in the merged undertaking should be satisfied In cash,to pay them all in cash i3 obviously impossible and to put forward such a proposal would be merely another way of saying that there -shall be no merger.
- e - 165(10)    Appointment of the Board,I now come to the remaining and most serious point to which added importance has been lent by the changed political circumstances.Amendments were put down last Session by Colonel Ashley and certain other members with the object cf altering the constitution of the Board along the lines suggested by Sir Oscar Warburg as the London County Council&apos;s witness before the Joint Committee.      Briefly the proposal of the Council was to substitute for the small business Board of five persons appointed by the minister, a larger body composed as to one-third of local authority representatives, and as to the remainder of representatives of finance, labour,  and a certain number of persons appointed by the Minister.     This body was in turn to appoint an Executive Committee who were to be responsible for the day to day management of the undertaking, but apparently all matters of policy would be reserved for the Board.      These proposals were clearly not fully thought out, and have been modified in details in the amendmentsmentioned above.      An analysis and criticism of the proposals are contained in Appendix Bc      The proposal was debated very fully before the Joint Committee, and in the event rejected.Sir Oscar Warburg&apos;s proposals were entirely different from those originally contemplated by the Council as revealed in their cross-examination of the Government&apos;s witnesses and in the speach of their Counsel,      Mr.Pritt, J.V.C. cross-examining wir,Herbert Morrison said that the London County Council were not asking for direct representation on the Transport Board but that two members of the Board should be appointed by the London Traffic Advisory Committee (Oues. k9i1.9-k.95i).      Later he hinted (Ques. if957) that the Council might be satisfied if two members of the Board were required to have municipal experience.
The object of the Bill is to ensure that the vast undertaking to he vested in the Board shall he managed on business linos by a small body of highly qualified persons imbued with a full sense of responsibility.      The efficient management of such an undertaking must depend upon the capacity of the ^oard to take speedy decisions to meet rapidly changing circumstances,,      A managing body made up of representatives of interests, which may frequently be in conflict, is, in my judgment, entirely unsuitable for the conduct of the complicated business of London passenger transport.If this be accepted, the problem is to see whether some means can be found for meeting or mitigating the objection whicii is felt to the appointment of the Board by the Minister, A Board definitely controlled by the local authorities is impracticable in vie&quot;// of the large number of authorities (approaching 200) in the area and it would clearly be wrong to commit the direction of a huge busineso undertaking to representatives of local bodies who have no financial responsibility for the capital involved,,      The following proposals might be considered as alternatives to those in the Bill &apos;.nd with a view to meeting the objection to appointment of the  entire Board by the Minister :-(i)    That the persons to constitute the original board should be nominated in the Bill and that vacancies should be filled by the Minister from nominations submitted to him by the Board.      There can be no objection in principle to the nomination of the original Board in the Bill, but in practice it may not be easy to obtain acceptance of such appointments in advance of the passing of the Bill, (ii)    That the duty of appointing the Board and fillingvacancies should be vested not in the Minister of Transport afoer consultation with the Treasury, as proposed, but in a small selection
board consisting of persons holding office ex ofxicio,,      buck a Board might, for example, consist of the Minister of Transport as Chairman, the Chairman for the time being of the London Traffic Advisory Committee (a body consisting predominantly of represe&quot;atatives of local authorities in the London traffic area) and one or possibly three outside and independent occupants of positions of responsibility of a permanent character.      It would be undesirable to enlarge the body of selection in such a way as to make it appear to be or function as a collection of representatives of interests and weaken the sense of responsibility., (iii) Provision could he made in the Bill that one member of the Board shall be appointed by the Minister, after consultation with the London Traffic Advisory Committee, as being a person experienced in the conduct of local affairs in the Board&apos;s area.      The danger of embodying this formally in the Bill is that it would revive demands for assured representation of other interests such as those of labour employed in the industry, but such a demand could no doubt be more easily resisted in the present house of Commons than in the last-Civ; It would no doubt go further towards meeting the local authorities&apos; point of view if the number of the Board vere increased to seven members and two were nominated by the Counties and Municipal and County Boroughs in the area., The chief controversial issue connected with the Bill turns upon this matter oi appointment of the Board.      It should be possible to find a solution of this point without accepting
the series of amendments of doubtful practicability which figured on the Order paper last session, or without otherwise destroying the essentials of a souna scheme.      I propose, therefore, to continue informal discussions, which I have already begun, with a view to exploring the means of meeting the desire of the London County Council for the introduction of a greater element of local government representation and for some reduction in the power of selection vested by the Bill in the Minister.     Until these conversations have advanced further, it would seem premature to commit ourselves to any particular line of solution and,  in order that the position should not be prejudiced by the appearance of amendments on the Order paper, notice of any motion reviving the Bill should no doubt be deferred for the present.(Intld.)   P^J-P.16th November, 192i*.
Appendix A.LONDON PASSENGER TRANSPORT BILL.Metropolitan Railway.I     Claim of the Company that their undertaking should not he transferred to the new Board as part of the consolidated system of London Passenger Transport hut that the Metropolitan should he regarded as a &quot;Main-line&quot; Railway and included in the proposed pooling scheme with the four Amalgamated Railway Companies.The Metropolitan Railway Company base their claim on three main grounds, viz:-(l)    that their undertaking projects into the countryfor a considerable distance beyond the London Passenger Transport Area to be set up under the Bill and carries a large proportion of traffic for long distances as compared with the &quot;Tube&quot; traffic.(2) that a very considerable mineral and goods traffic is carried, amounting in 193O to no less than 5,000,000 tons, as well as parcels and mails.(5)    that the Metropolitan Railway is closely associated with both the Great Western and the London and North Eastern Railway companies;    the trains of those companies run over parts of the Metropolitan&apos; system and parts of that system are in the joint ownership of the Metropolitan and those respective companies.The statement that their undertaking projects into the country for a considerable distance beyond the London Passenger Transport Area is liable to be misleading in Its inference.      The Metropolitan Railway system proper lies entirely within the Area.      The Company apparently base their statement upon the fact that they constructed the line which run  from Harrow
to Verney Junction via Aylesbury and now operate it jointly with the London and North Eastern Railway Company.      This line has, however, been leased to the Metropolitan and Great Central Railways Joint Committee for a period of 999 years.      The London and North Eastern Railway is now part owner of the line and shares in the profits.On the transfer of the Metropolitan undertaking to the new Board, the latter would replace the Metropolitan in the joint working arrangement with the London and North Eastern Railway.     No practical difficulty would arise.The mileage of the joint line outside the London Passenger Transj;ort Area amounts to only JO^ miles, of which 6-g- miles run parallel and immediately adjacent to the boundary of that area and thus serve   part of the area.      The total route mileage of the lines worked either wholly or jointly by the Metropolitan Railway Company is 983 miles.The average third class fare on the Metropolitan is only 2;Jd. and is actually less than that (2*97d.) on the &quot;Tube&quot; and District Railways, while the average length of journey is also less 2.71 miles and 3.78 miles respectively. The average third-class fare on the Main-line Railways varies from approximately 1/t^d. on the Southern to 1/6-gd.  on the Great Western.The freight traffic conveyed over the Metropolitan Railway consists almost entirely of traffic originating on the systems of the Main-line Companies and conveyed over short sections of the Metropolitan Railway    in central London.      The total freight traffic of the Metropolitan Railway in 1 9JJ0 was under if-g- million tons, of which only about 50,000 tons originated on the Company&apos;s own system as compared with 525 million tons for Great Britain as a whole.      The average
length of haul for freight traffic on the Metropolitan for 1930 was just over 2 miles as compared with 54.^ miles for all standard gauge railways in Great Britain.The traffic of the Metropolitan Railway is mainly passenger traffic a3 will he apparent from the traffic receipts for 19J0 which were as follows:- Receipts from Passengers 1,421,612&quot; &quot;   Parcels, Mails, etc. k$UklM &quot;   Freight traffic. 157,645The operation hy the Board of the relatively small amount of freight and parcel traffic on the Metropolitansystem will present no difficulty.While the Metropolitan Railway is associated with&quot;both the Great Western and L5  &amp; N^B.  its association withthe Underground Group of railways, and, in particular, theMetropolitan District Railway, is much   closer.,      Mr* R--.rL Selbielate General Manager of the Metropolitan Railway in evidence&quot;before the Select Committee on Transport (Metropolitan Area)on the 2nd July, 1919, stated* in my view one of the most obvious and necessaryreforms required at the present time is a completefusion of interests between the Metropolitan andthe District Railways,      The two companies work together as far as possible without completeamalgamation, but there are necessarily points where their interests clash and there are improvements in.working;  greatly to the public interest, whichcannot be carried out without the two systems being brought under one control and their financial interest being mergedc&quot;As indicating the extent to which the Metropolitan Railway is bound up with the Metropolitan District and Underground Railways, the following may be noted
(i)   The &quot;Inner Circle&quot; is worked jointly by the Metropolitan and Listrict Companies and, by the City Lines Act of 1675* eaoh Company has running powers over the other&apos;s railways for the purpose; (ii)   The City Lines end Extension Railway between CannonStreet and Aldgate Ib owned and worked jointly by the Metropolitan and District Companies.     It forms part of the &quot;Inner Circle&quot;, (iii)   The Harrow and Uxbridge line is owned by theMetropolitan;    the District Company has running rights ever the line under an Act of 1899* (iv)   The East London Railway (Shoreditch to New Cross) is owned by the Southern Railway but is leased to the London end North Sastern, the Metropolitan and the District Companies.     By agreement the Metropolitan work the line but the District have f equal running rights and may provide the serviceswhen the existing agreement terminates, (v) The line between Aldgate and Whitechapel is owned and worked jointly by the Metropolitan and District Companies.(vi)   Joint stations owned by the Metropolitan and the District or Underground Companies for inter-change facilities exist at Moor gate Stree-c, Old Street, Kings Cross, Baker Street. Paddiugton and Liverpool Street, (vii)   The Western Joint Stations (High Street, Kensington, Gloucester Road and South Kensington) are jointly owned and worked by the Metropolitan and the District Companies, (viii)   Agreements exist between the Metropolitan and the District Companies on the one hand and the Southern Railway Company on the other with regard to through workings on the Richmond line
mThere are three railways running east and west across Londonj    one controlled by the Metropolitan from Hammersmith to Liverpool Street, the other two,  the central London from Shepherds Bush to Liverpool Street and the District Railway from Hammersmith to Aldgate being controlled by the Underground group.      To ensure maximum efficiency and co-ordination of working, it is essential that these three parallel lines should be under one managementcOne of the tube railways,  the great Northern and City (Pinsbury Park to Moorgate Street) is part of the Metropolitan System,.without complete unification of operation and management of the miscellaneous pieces of line which make up the present Metropolitan system with the Metropolitan District Railway and the Tubes now controlled by the Underground group, the efficiency, economies and developments at which the Bill aims will be very seriously impaired.between Hammersmith, and Richmond,      The District Company is exercising those rights to the exclusion of the Metropolitan and compensating the latter for standing aside, (ix)   Agreements exist between the Metropolitan Company and the Underground Companies for, inter alia, the exchange of current supply and through bookings,
C la lir. of . the Metropolitan, for an option to require paymentj    Caaju(-I)    This claim is based on the contention that the Stockholders of the Company ought not to be compelled to exchange their existing holdings for some other stock of the value of which they are not informed.      It is obvious that no merger on a scale of this kind is practicable on a cash basis and that such a claim if persisted in is tantamount to a refusal to merge at all.(2)    The stockholders of the Metropolitan consist of investors who today have the security and derive their dividends from a London transport undertaking and there should be no inequity in their being required to accept,  in exchange for their present holdings,  stock in the same kind of undertaking, provided, that due regard is had to the relative values of the existing and the substituted stocks.      Their interests in this regard are properly protected.Under the Bill the arbitration tribunal are required to award a consideration in stock equivalent to the value of the undertaking and it will be open to the Metropolitan to argue the relative values of the stocks, both from the point of view of security and maintainable income.From the point of view of security, Sir W.McLintock has expressed the view that the Board, having a monopoly of public passenger transport, will be in a much stronger position than the Metropolitan Railway Company.In considering the position and prospects of the Company&apos;s Stockholders it has to be recollected:-(1 )    that the Metropolitan have suffered,  are suffering and,  if the Bill is not passed into law, will go on suffering more and more from road competition.      They have made strong complaint of such competition,  to which they are peculiarly
susceptible, particularly from short-distance express coach services.      (During the first kif weeks of the current year,  the passenger receipts of the Company have declined by .0^5, 600 (or      %) as compared with those of the corresponding period of last year); (2)    that as their lines between Baker Street andFinchley Road are now being worked to capacity, no development of their traffic can take place until they have incurred considerable capital expenditure in remedying this bottle-neck.      They have not yet seen their way to raise the necessary capital for an improvement stated to be urgent in(3)    If the ivietropolitan Railway had been amalgamated either, with a London group or a Main-line Group under the Railways Act, 1921, the stocks and shares of the Metropolitan Company would have been exchanged for stocks and shares of the Amalgamated Company.The shareholders of the constituent Companies were given no option under the Railways Act.      The amalgamations were compulsory and the ultimate decision as to the consideration in each case rested with the Amalgamation Tribunal,  subject to the directions given in Section 6 of the Act of 1921.      The principle of that Act was opposed by the Great Northern Railway Company on much the same grounds as are now being advanced by the Metropolitan Company.      Yet, Parliament decided in 15*21  that it was in the public interest that some 120 separate railway companies throughout the country should be amalgamated into four Companies,
AJlJLJi-JLJi-lJL3London Passenger Transpoft Bill.The series of amendments put down by Colonel Ashley and others aim   at a fundamental alteration in the consituticn of the London Tae&amp;enger Transport Board,,      The scheme proposed in the amendments appears to be as follows1.      The email business Board of 5 proposed in the Bill is to be replaced by a Board of 14,  including the chairman, representative of various interests as follows(a) The Chairmen raid three other members are apparently to be appointed by the Minister without consults-tion and without restriction as to their qualifica-tienso(b) Four members are to be appointed by the Minister after consultation with the Treasury and the Bank of England,(c) Two members are to be appointed by the Minister after consultation with the Ministry of Labour,(d) Four members (who are to be persons of not less then 6 years experience of local government in the area which they represent) are to be appointed by the Minister from nominations by Joint Committee&apos;s representative of local authorities in the area cf the Board&apos;s operation,      Of these four,, two are to be nominated by a Joint Committee appointed by the London County Council,,  the City Corporation and the Metropolitan Borough Councils,. The other two are to be appointed by a Joint Committee appointed by all the other local
authorities (other than parish councils) in the London Passenger Transport Area,Members of the Board are to be -appointed for three years -the whole Board retiring at the end of each period of three years,      The quorum of the Board is to be five.The Board is to be empowered to pay to their Chairman and Vice-Chairman such salaries, fees and allowances for expenses as the Board may determine:;.. Apparently the other Members are to be unpaid,2,      The amendments also provide for the appointment of an Executive Committee of not less than 3 or more than 6 persons 11 for the purpose o.f operating the undertaking of the Board and carrying out their other functions and duties under this Act.&quot; The Executive Committee is to be appointed by the Board after consultation with the Minister.)  and the members are to be paid such salaries, fees and allowances and to be appointed for such terms, not being less than three or more than seven years,as the 7Board,  after consultation with the Minister., may determine.It appears to be at variance with all constitutional practice that a body of this kind not itself responsible to Parliament  should ho required to act only after consultation with a Minister of the Crown,? but should then be free to take its own course,,.The qualifications proposed for the members of the Exe-executive Committee are identical with those laid down in the Bill for members of the Board and membership of the Board does not disqualify for appointment to the Executive Committee.
3.      The Committee are to operate the undertaking of the Board subject to such directions (whether general or special) as the Board may give.     The Committee are to have all Incidental powers necessary to the performance of this duty but this is &quot;subject to the provisions of this Act.&quot;      It is presumed that one of the said provisions is that whereby all expenditure is to be incurred by the Board, but the Board are empowered to delegate the right to incur expendi-ture to the Committee to such extent as the Board may from time to time prescribe *     The effect of this apparently complete control of expenditure by the Bou.rd would seem thatj except under delegated authority, the Executive Committee could not enter into any contract involving expenditure or in any way pledge the credit of the Board. They would, therefore, in effect be completely subordinated to the Beard-.It is proposed that the Committee shall annually submit to the Board for their approval detailed estimates of revenue and expenditure^ and if necessary supplementary estimates.      This part of the scheme seems to be model]ed on local authority procedure, treating the Executive Committees as a sort of Finance Committee:    indeed the movers of the amendments seem generally to be seeking to graft a scheme of management based on local authority procedure on to a Bill conceived in an entirely different spirit *      The Executive Committee, occupying an ambiguous position between the Controlling Board and its staff could hardly be expected to overcome the hampering effects of so ponderous a system of controlo     Ersn if the Board delegated its powers very widely, the Executive Committee would still lack responsibility and be liable to have its decision reversed and its policy altered by the superior Board?The Committee are to submit annually to the Board a general report and to review generally the position of the undertakingc.    Here the Committee are to set out their proposals for development cr improvements,
The objects of the alternative scheme were expressed as being the desire to transfer from the Minister to the local authorities the ultimate accountability of the Board. It was said that as under the Bill the Minister appoints the Board, and in certain circumstances may remove a member., he would in effect control the Board and that as London transport is a local problem the responsibility of those conducting it should be with the locally elected bodies. It was also contended that in the absence of direct local authority representation on the Board there was a risk that the &quot;Local Government point of view&quot; might nut be given adequate weight by the Board.These points were answered fully by Mr. Tilfred Greene, ,  on behalf of the Government before the Joint Committee (proceedings pages 1073-1080).      He shewed that while, following the precedent set by the Electricity Supply Act, 1926- the members of the Board are to be appointed by the Minister, such appointment will not, as shewn by past experience and a 11 reasonable probability,  involve control by the Minister and that in fact the powers of the Minister were strictly limited and in many respects notably as regards control of charges., less than those proposed to be conferred on him by the Bills promoted by the London County Council and the Underground Companies in 13 29c      Furthermore it was pointed out that any risk there might be of the &quot;Local Government point of view&quot; being overlooked was amply met by the powers, and duties which the Bill would confer on the London Traffic Advisory Committee, on which the Local Authorities would have a considerable majority.
The chief objections seen to the scheme which the amendments are designed to bring about are;-(1) That the,constitution of the Board,  as proposedis cumbrous in form and may well prove sectional in its outlook and inefficient in its execution.      The setting up cf a sort of super-Beard to appoint and control an expert Executive Committee, is   to the extent that it achieves its avowed object, likely to detract seriously from the ability,  energy and sense of responsibility of tne Management.      On the one hand there is no guarantee that the persons appointed to the Board would be parsons specially suitable to con-trol the intricate and delicate machinery of London transport - rather would they tend to be persons appointed simply to represent and enforce the sectional interests which nominated them.      On the other hand the type of man who is possessed of the necessary -experience,  ability aid breadth of outlook to be quail-fled to direct so vast an undertaking as that to be vested in the Board would be unlikely to accept appointment if he is to be liable to be overridden in his decisions by a body of persons appointed as pro-posed to represent sectional and possibly opposing views -- and thus to set; his plans frustrated by the &quot;opposing pulls&quot; of the interests.      In such circum-stances the sense of corporate as well as of individual responsibility is inevitably weakened,,It has been suggested that the -proposals are analogous to those of a company with a Board of Directors and a Management   working under Its control:w  5   rr
There is in&apos; fact no such analogy,.      The Beard of Directors of a Company controls and directs the officers of the Company;, not some inferior Board which is in turn interposed between the directors and the departmental chiefs.      The proposal, if it were carried out, would tend to remove the controlling body from direct contact with the actual day tc day management.      This Olympian withdrawal from such mundane matters will hardly tend to keep the Board in that close touch with the facts of the situation which effective direction demands.Against the criticism that the proposals involved a mare representation of sectional interests an attempt has been made to distinguish between &quot;advancing the arguments in favour of the different points of view&apos;1 and seeing that those arguments received proper consideration.      Given a body constituted as proposed xt is obvious that here is a distinction without a difference., since each section will naturally look to the others to advance the arguments in favour of the interests or points of view which they have been appointed to safeguard and will chiefly be concerned with maintaining the particular interests which are its own particular care,        The Board will thus tend to become a debating-society.,(3) while tending to destroy the responsibility ofthe Board to parliament, through the MinisterP the scheme of the amendments does not substitute effective accountability of the Board to anyone.      Presumably it is intended that the Executive Committee shall be responsible to the Board, but to whom is the Beard itself to be responsible and by whom can it be called to account if its decisions prove to be financially
or otherwise disastrous?     It is true that as the amendments are now framed the Minister appoints all the members of the Board., but as the majority are the nominees of various other parties there can be no collective responsibility to the Minister and in practice each member will tend to regard himself as representing and accountable to the particular tody which nominated him? ice. ? some to local authorities, some to the Dank of England3 some to the Minister and some perhaps to the Trades Union Congress *      Here indeed is a picture of divided responsibility and when it is borne in mind that the local authorities in the area number nearly two hundred the scheme is seen to be utterly destructive of any real sense cf corporate responsibility such as the Bill is designed to secure.      In fact it is difficult to see how the proposals can be reconciled with any effective responsibility whatever.      A catholicity of interests is no substitute for corporate responsibility if efficient manage-ment is the aim.A further point is the question of continuity of policy and experience.      If , as proposed, the members of the Board are to be elected every three years there is likely to be a continual change of personnel.      The local authorities in particular are likely to proceed on the basis that unless all the electing bodies are separately represented there snail bo some sort of rota9 whether formally recognised or not. whereby each authority secures a direct representative in turn, (s) An essential factor in the success of the board is its financial stability and its ability to raise new capital on the market at reasonable rates.      Unlike the local authorities or the Metropolitan Water Board, the proposed Transport Board will have no rate precepting powers behind it nor can it call upon the financial assistance of the State..        It must pay its way and rest its credit on its
own merits..    Therefore it is essential that it should he of such a character and co constituted as to command the confidence of investors.      The presence of a minority of nominees of the Bank of England may not outweigh the general sence of insecurity and fear of inefficiency which so cumbrous and complice ted a machine may engender and the large local authority and labour representation may give rise to a fear that experience and efficiency may be subordinated to local end sectional aims.    No one will know quite hov such a Board will in practice work out and what its policy may prove to be-It is considered that the credit of a Board constituted as proposed in the amendments could not fail to be definitely less good than that of a Board constituted, as    proposed in the Bill-.17th November, 19-31&quot;
Appendix C-LONDON PASSENGER TRANSPORT BILL.principal ameaclnenua made in the Bill &quot;by the Joint iselect Committee which meet criticisms raised on Second Reading.(1)    Agreements wore reached with the Underground undertakings with the Main Lint Railway Companies and with the London County Council (as to terms of transfer of their trans) and were accepted by the Committee and embodied in Bill.(2) The Joint Select Committee amended the Bill so as to provide that the period of appointment of members of the Board shall be not less than 5 years.(j5)    The duties and powers of the Minister of Transport have been curtailed by a variety of amendments.      In particular it is to be noted that the pooling scheme between the Board and the Amalgamated Railways will now be a statutory obligation and the Arbitration Tribunal are required to approve its terms or failing agreement between the parties to prepare and settle a scheme in accordance with the provisions of the Bill.      The Bill as introduced provided that the Minister should decide in default of any agreement whether a pooling scheme should be enforced or not.(if)    Under Clause 21 as introduced the Minister had a deciding voice on questions connected with the withdrawal or provision of facilities.      The Bill has, however, been amended during its progress before the joint Committee in several important ways, viz.,  (a) the insertion of a direction that in considering whether he shall make an order under the section he shall have regard to the desirability of the establishment and maintenance by the Board of an adequate reserve fund;    (b) the filled-up hill provided that the Minister shall not make an Order which would, in his opinion, preclude the Board from complying with their
- 2 -obligations to fix fares and charges so that their revenues shall be sufficient to defray all charges required to be defrayed out of revenue.      The words &quot;in his opinion&quot; have now been struck out; . and (c) words have been inserted to provide that an .;rder shall not be made if  it necessitates bhe raising of additional capital.(5)    The Minister had power to control the amount the Board was to place to reserve.      This power has been deleted and the character of the reserve fund has been changed:.(6)    The powers of the Board to manufacture for its own purposes, which were extensive... have been struck out.      The Board Is nsw precluded from manufacturing, any rolling stock or vehicles except to the limited extent of making omnibus bodies.
U.; ug,GtJAlMT IS ,IHff ^^ROPERTY T OF .HIS BRITANNIC 1 MAJEBT/Y ^SnrGOySSNMTBNTl1.    The Bill was subjected to a most exhaustive and critical examination by a Joint Select Committee representative of all parties.     The Committee proceedings occupied 35 Parliamentary days, spread over a period of 3 months.      If the Bill is dropped, the large amount of time, money and effort expended on its promulgation would be wasted.      Apart from the heavy costs incurred by the various petitioners, some  35,000 expended in connection with the Bill in the shape of Counsels&apos; and Accountants&apos; fees and similar items would fall to be borne finally by the Exchequer instead of being recovered from the Transport Board, as provided in the Bill.2.    During the proceedings in Committee, agreements were reached between the Minister and by far the greater majority of the interests concerned^(a)    Complete agreement was reached with the UndergroundGroup of Companies, (railway, omnibus and tramway companies) both on the principles of the Bill and the terms of transfer.      These companies represent over 75 per cent, of the interests proposed to be merged under the new Board.(b)    Apart from the objection of the London County Councilto the proposed composition of the Transport Board, to which reference is made later, practically complete agreement has been reached with the 14 local authorities owning tramways in the London Traffic Area.CEET.C A B I N E T.P.214(31)Reasons for proceeding with the LONDON PASSENGER TRANSPORT BILL during the forthcoming special Session of Parliament.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT,
i 0/1&quot;In tiie ease of the-London Conrrty &quot;Council -and theCounty Councils of Middlesex and Hertfordshire-,&apos; the terms of transfer have been agreed and the exact amounts of stock to he issued are specified in the Bill.In the case of Bexley and Ilford, their oppositionhas been met by providing that the terms uponwhich their tramways undertakings are to betransferred to the&quot;&quot;&quot;new Board shall, failing agreement, be settled by the Arbitration Tribunal..All the remaining local authorities concerned are incomplete agreement-with the Bill as it now stands.(c)    The main points made by the Metropolitan RailwayCompany were:-(l)  that they should be excluded from the compulsory merger of London Passenger Transport interests and treated as though they were a main line ^ or(2)  that, if included in the mergerj theirshareholders (or at least their ordinary shareholders)  should be given the option of taking cash or stock-They also objected to the taking over by the new Board of their Surplus Lands Committee.The last point has been conceded and the necessary machinery for converting this Committee into a new Company has been inserted by agreement in the Bill.The Committee listened to prolonged arguments an theclaim to be paid in cash.      All the other interests concerned (except the small independent omnibus proprietors, who are given the option of cash)        * have agreed to accept stock of the new Board, and to require the Board in the early days of its existence to raise on the market in cash the amount required to satisfy the Metropolitan ordinary stockholders would be unreasonable.      Sir William McLintock very strongly took this view.
- 3 -In the event, it was&apos; successfully contended bythe Promoters that the Metropol-it^rri--sloar^laolders.^ 7/ould suffer no injustice in being required to take stock in the now undertaking in exchange for1 that now held in their own undertaking.    This follows the precedent of the Railways Act,1921. The claim that the Metropolitan Railway Company is a main line and should bo treated like the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, for example, Is untenable.    Its small goods traffic, which consists mainly of coal,  is hauled for about 2 miles only over a section of the Inner Circle.    The great bulk of its traffic is purely suburban passenger traffic and the average fare per passenger is 2^-d. Any scheme which proposed to coordinate London transport and left the Inner Circle and other sections of the Metropolitan line in Independent hands would&apos; be a makeshift and incomplete arrange-ment and the complete absorption of the line presents no difficulty. It may be added that no single interest-called any traffic witness throughout the proceedings, to contest the principles on which the Bill is based.^ and which require the complete fusion-of-all the interests other than those of the main lines, whose suburban lines cannot be physically separated from the rest of their undertaking and can, therefore, only be brought within the scope of the co-ordination through a pooling of receipts, (d)   The Tilling Group of Omnibus Companies have   all along accepted the general scheme cf the Bill and the only question outstanding with them was
that of terras.     The Bill leaves the-terms to he determined, -failing- agreement, hy the Arbil^ra-tlon Tribunal under directions settled by the Joint Committee after hearing the views of all parties. This, it is understood, removes any further opposition from the Tilling Group,Complete agreement has been reached with theimportant Provincial Omnibus Companies who operate in the areas contiguous to the London Traffic Area. This agreement includes the Main Line Companies In so far as they are financially interested in the operations of these Omnibus Companies.With regard to the smaller omnibus and coachcompanies affected by the Bill, all points of substance in their opposition have been met and the Joint Committee were obviously satisfied that the interests of the smaller men and companies would be adequately safeguarded by the provisions of the Bill as amended.Tho interests of the manufacturers, gas water and electricity undertakers, who petitioned against the Bill, have been adequately safeguarded by amendments or clauses inserted during the Committee stage. In most cases the amendments or new classes were agreed with the interests concerned.
(h) Since tho Bill received a Se^c^Jrt ending,complete agreement has been reached with the four Amalgamated Railway Companies,    The Bill, as now amended, sets up a pool of passenger receipts between the Board and these companies and this scheme of compulsorv pooling constitutes one of the most important and far-reaching proposals In the Bill.    It is an arrangement to which the Amalgamated Companies attach the utmost importance as safeguarding them in future from&apos; uneconomic road competition.    It also provides the best prospect of further suburban electrification otherwise than by the aid of State subsidies.(i) Complete agreement has been reached with the variousTrade Unions and Associations representing the officers and other employees of the various undertakings to be transferred, with regard to terms of transfer, superannuation funds, etc. Agreement has also been reached with all the important Unions concerned for the establishment of a Statutory Wages. Machinery relating to certain grades.    These arrangements are accepted by the National Associations of Local Government Officers (The Clerical staff of the London County Council claimed special rights of representation which the Joint Committee decided net to allow.)It will be seen that the criticisms made against the Bill on Second Reading have been largely met. Agreement has boon reached as to terms of transfer with interests representing over 90 per cent, of the passengers carried in the area and 82 per cent, of the capital involved.       As regards remaining
interests, the directions to the Arbitration Tribunal as to compensation have been modified by the Joint Committee to meet objections raised.      The power to manufacture has been deleted (apart from a circumscribed right to manufacture bodies of omnibuses as is now being done on a large scale by the London General Omnibus Company in&apos;its existing shops at Chiswick)-In various other directions, amendments restricting the powers of the Board and clauses protective of special interests have been inserted.      In particular the powers of the Minister have been curtailed and his power to order the provisions of new facilities is restricted so that he must have regard to the desirability of the establishment and maintenance by the Board of an adequate reserve fund and is debarred from making any order which would preclude the Board from complying with their obligations to meet the various charges on their revenue or would necessitate the raising of additional capital, save with the Board&apos;s consent, or an application by the Board to Parliament for additional powers.The only important points which may be said to be possibly still at issue are:-(i)    The proposal of the London County Council that the new Board should be subject to an over-riding authority composed as to one-third of Local Authority representatives, the remaining two-thirds being found from representatives of finance, labour and the central Government, This proposal was debated very fully before the Joint Committee and definitely rejected as an unsuitable type of organisation for managing and directing the business of London Passenger Transport.
The Committee very fully conside-red the su^^stlon, which was not pressed,  that the Board should contain an element elected ay the stockholders or certain classes of the stockholders..      It was pointed out that this would go far towards depriving the Board of its character as a public authority.      Neither in the case of the Central Electricity Board, nor the Port of London Authority, nor any of the Statutory Dock Commissioners is provision made for election by holders of the Authority&apos;s stocks.      Moreover, it was pointed out that if partial representation was accorded to the stockholders it would, not be possible to refuse representation to labour, to local authorities in the area and possibly to other sectional interests.      The whole conception of management by a business board would then be destroyed.It was further pointed out that it would not be practicable to confer monopolistic powers over the very wide area involved upon a body controlled by the stockholders through election of the Board, unless extensive powers of regulation and control were invested in the Minister,  a course which was open to objection on many grounds.After seeking various alternatives the Joint Coj.jait.teeeventually accepted as the most appropriate the scheme-propounded in the Bill.(ii) The claims of the Metropolitan Railway Company to be satisfied in cash or to be treated as a Main Line Railway Company and included in the pooling arrangement may be revived but they will receive no support from the Main Lines or other interests and have been definitely rejected by the Joint Coiomittee.WIWfi?rffiM uiiii ii i ii iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii in.....a..........i.............i...............................................i
The financial settlements with the Underground Group of Companies have &quot;been based on the assumption that the undertakings of these companies will be transferred to the new Board on the 1st January, 1932*      Tne settlements with Local Authorities assume that transfer will take place on the 1st April, 19^2.Any postponement of the Bill may, therefore, affect the financial structure of these settlements and might result in the re-openin^ of the whole question of terms.It v/ould, in any case, be necessary to embark at considerable expense upon further investigation of current figures and to k.ee*p some check upon the financial operations of the companies.Moreover, delay in putting the Bill upon the Statute Book and in setting up the Board would leave an interval during which, as the experience of the last two years has shewn many awkward questions may arise from the settlement of which the Government could hardly hold aloof.      In undertakings of this scope and variety business cannot stand still, and the management is iorced to take action in many ways which may affect the interests of a future Board. Lord Ashfield has maae a practice of consulting the Minister before taking any steps which might be held prejudicially to affect future public policy and would no doubt continue to do so.Finally,  it may be urged that the very real advantage of complete co-ordination ought not to be postponed.     The economic waste involved by the present system delays and obstructs much needed public improvements and the position ox the Main Line Companies will be increasingly serious ii  they are left exposed to the intensified competition of the &quot;Green Line&quot; and other coach services in the suburban area.
1 o a-L ti2J st August, 19&apos;-51.In view of the entire absence of serious-objection to the traffic principles on which the Bill is based and of the very large measure of agreement reached as to financial terms, it is submitted that any opposition to the Bill proceeding through its further stages can be confined to very narrow limits, even if it cannot be removed altogether.There are certain matters in which the late Government might have wished to alter some of the amendments made in Committe The power to manufacture bodies of motor vehicles is so restricted as to be illogical, inconvenient and uneconomical. The Arbitration Clause, as it now stands, may possibly have the result of enabling the independent omnibus proprietors, for example, to secure compensation on a basis which would not ordinarily be accorded by a-commercial arbitrator to -undertakings of that kind. There -lay be a few other points upon which, apart from drafting, amendments would be desirable in the interests of the Board, but, generally speaking, it is thought that  the Board might start its existence substantially on the terms of the Bill as amended in Committee and be left to seek any additional powers or protection it may require by promoting subsequent legislation of its own in due course as it would be entitled to doIt may be added that the scheme embodied in the Bill entails no charge on public funds and no burden on public credit,(lnt&apos;d) C.&quot;V* H.
