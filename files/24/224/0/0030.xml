C R E T..      295(511. COPY HO.     -OfC A BINE T.REPORT OP THE COMMITTEE CN  EDUCATION AND SUPPLY OF BIOLOGISTS. (Paper No,  O.P.   391(51)).MEMORANDUM BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION. &apos;The establishment of this Committee was largely due to the initiative of my predecessor, Sir Charles Trevelyan, who was impressed with the need for an authoritative inquiry into the subject.      The Committee&apos; s Report wajs completed in May last, that is to say before the emergence of the present crisis.The Report,  in the first place,  calls attention to the inadequacy, both in numbers and quality, of candidates to meet the growing demand for biologists for service in this, country and the Colonies.      It attributes this in part to the uncertainty as to vacancies and the unattractiveness of the career in the Colonial services, and in part to educational causes.On the educational side,  the Report refers    to certain defects in the curricula of secondary schools,  and in the Scholarship and the Degree Examinations at Universities, and to the shortage of teachers competent to teach the subject in the schools.In its final recommendations the Committee recognises that no single Department is responsible for all the matters referred to, and that it will be necessary to secure the goodITS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJEoTY&apos; S QOVERNMIWi
will and co-operation of the secondary schools, the Colleges at Oxford and Cambridge, and the Faculties of Science at the various Universities.      The Report recommends Eis Majesty&apos;s Gove ment in the first instance to invite the President of the Board of Education, in consultation with those of his ministerial colleagues who are immediately concerned, to prepare for their consideration concrete plans for the initiation and conduct of trie negotiations required to give effect to the Report.The present crisis has, for the time being at any rate, materially altered the position, and it is by no means clear that any action on the Report can usefully he taken at the present time.      So far as I am personally concerned -(a) I recommend that the Report should be published. This at  least seems due to the distinguished ^persons who were members of the Committee or gave evidence before it.      I understand that the Chairman (Lord Chelmsford)  is anxious for its issue.(b) l  it is so desired, I should be happy,  in accordance with the recommendation of the Committee, to consider in consultation with those of my colleega.es immediately concerned whether there is any direction in which action on the recommendations of the Committee can usefully be initiated at the present t ime *(Intldj    D.M.rd of Education,.
